1
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,207
Not so fast

2
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:12,332
Come on

3
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,707
Climb Fatso.

4
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,582
Climb Fatso, climb.

5
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,457
Don't fall on us or we'll die.

6
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,332
I'm slipping

7
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,665
Put your foot here.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,457
Now go.

9
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,665
Go on you cow..

10
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,665
Careful

11
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,040
Come on

12
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,374
Easy..

13
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,915
Fatso, you eat too much.

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,999
I got tired giving him a leg up.

15
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,415
You're no less..

16
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,165
Did you see yourself?

17
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,499
At least I did it on my own.

18
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,790
He almost crushed us.

19
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,832
Did you see his legs
dangling in mid air?

20
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,665
I'm hungry..

21
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,332
Forget it fatso.
We're already late.

22
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,040
Thanks to this idiot,
I've started pronouncing it

23
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,832
'Filum' instead of film.

24
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,915
Walk on the side.

25
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,332
Four tickets please..

26
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,040
Quickly, give me your money.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,540
Here..
- Twenty..

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,165
My twenty..

29
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,915
You?
- Don't have any..

30
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,874
You're so cheap..

31
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,457
Why are you always like this?

32
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,999
Keeps eating, that's why..

33
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,457
Lets go, quick..

34
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,665
Hurry hurry..

35
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,874
It's just started.

36
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,957
Look at those..

37
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,582
This is a grape..

38
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,874
A very ripe grape..

39
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,665
Her name is 'Desire'

40
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,665
And she desires..

41
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:29,707
A young and handsome man..

42
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,540
Who will love her..

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,165
And enjoy the juice of this grape.

44
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,165
What a beauty..

45
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,499
Look behind..
- Why?

46
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,165
There's another movie going on.

47
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,540
Where's your wife?

48
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,957
Uncle!

49
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,374
Excuse me.

50
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,082
Yes?

51
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,957
You are very beautiful..

52
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,499
Oh!
- What?

53
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,290
It's Mr. Rathod. The Moustache.

54
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,082
Run! lt's the Moustache.

55
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,707
Bengali get up.

56
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,665
Look who it is..

57
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,165
Stop!

58
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,707
Run Fatso! Run fast.

59
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,790
Stop!
- Come on, fast!

60
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,082
Stop! Benoy..

61
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,874
Benoy.. Rohan..

62
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,124
What was Moustache doing there?

63
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,832
Watching the movie, what else?

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,207
Did he recognize us?

65
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,874
He was calling you
by your name, idiot!

66
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,249
Benoy.. Benoy..

67
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,790
Oh! He has a moped.

68
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,665
Should've punctured the tyres.

69
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,165
Why didn't you think of that before?

70
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,915
What if he complains?

71
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:11,207
If we reach school before
him he can't do anything.

72
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,540
Run. Come on, run Manu..

73
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,957
This time we're dead.

74
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,624
Don't think too much..

75
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,415
What happened?
- Lets see..

76
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,915
Don't..

77
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,499
He twisted his ankle.

78
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,499
And no one here to
straighten it out.

79
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,040
Shut up Bengali.

80
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,374
You guys carry on.
I'll get back on my own.

81
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,415
How? Will you fly?

82
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,082
Moustache will get you expelled.

83
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,082
And he'll throw you a parade?

84
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,624
Come on, lift him up.

85
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,082
Walk slowly..

86
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,165
Slowly..

87
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,415
Gently..

88
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,124
Oh!

89
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,915
Run
- Come on. Hurry!

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,082
Benoy.. do something..

91
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,790
Fatso lift his leg..

92
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,707
Hurry, you fat cow.

93
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:23,290
Run run run

94
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,374
See you at school!

95
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,874
He's gone..

96
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,457
What did you do, Junior?

97
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,457
Didn't finish my tasks.

98
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,665
That's it?

99
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,165
They sent you to Heady for that?

100
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,290
And what did you do?

101
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,415
Went to town for a film last night.

102
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,624
Then?

103
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,499
He broke his leg.

104
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,790
So?

105
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,290
Our luck ran out..

106
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,915
Now?

107
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,415
Don't know..

108
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,415
You got caught?

109
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,415
No. We're here to kiss Heady.

110
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,374
What will your father do?

111
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,124
Break whatever bones l have left.

112
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,249
My father will send me to
my grandmother in Singur..

113
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,624
to study in a government school..

114
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,332
if it still exists..

115
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,999
My father will be reading the news..

116
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,124
He'll ask, "You're home?"

117
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,332
I'll say, "Yes, it's vacation time".

118
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,915
He'll ask, "When do you go back?"

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,082
I'll say, "When they phone."

120
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,415
So?

121
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,624
We don't have a phone at home.

122
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,165
And you?

123
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,499
Rohan..

124
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,665
The boy is asking what
your father will do.

125
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,874
No idea..

126
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,749
I haven't seen him for eight years.

127
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,374
Why?

128
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,415
What was the name?

129
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,540
Whose name sir?

130
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,332
Name of the film.

131
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,957
Rohan?

132
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,707
Sir?

133
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,499
Kanti Shah's "Grapes."

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,915
Last year you left
all the taps running..

135
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,290
We had to evacuate
the whole hostel.

136
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,707
No sir, that was two years ago..

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,582
Last year it was the fans..

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,165
Sorry sir.

139
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,499
I just spoke to your
father Muninder.

140
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,665
We got a phone at home?

141
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,874
Shut up!

142
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,165
What did my father say?

143
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,749
He's coming to get you himself.

144
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,707
He's going to kill me sir.

145
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,290
Please.. one last chance..

146
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,915
Stand straight.

147
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,249
Yes

148
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,415
This is the third
time you've been caught.

149
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,874
Your parents have been informed.

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,832
They're waiting for you at home.

151
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,165
You are expelled.

152
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,124
No Sir please Sir.

153
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,790
Dismissed. All of you.

154
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,165
Rohan..

155
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:56,915
Sir.

156
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,582
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,999
Excuse me sir?

158
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,499
Please ask Mr.
Rathod who the lady was?

159
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,582
The one whose blouse
he had his hand in?

160
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,415
Please sir.

161
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,624
Where's Rohan?

162
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,499
There he is..

163
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,415
Scared?

164
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,499
We had to leave sometime..

165
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,790
Couldn't stay in school forever..

166
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,207
Want to hear a poem?

167
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,665
Sure..

168
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,832
Tiny scattered moments,

169
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,374
Sprinkled on the garden of
memories.

170
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,915
Strolling, bare foot, on them,

171
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,749
It feels we've wandered too far..

172
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,915
Now we can't remember,
where we left our shoes.

173
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,374
Our heels were soft
when we got here,

174
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,207
They still feel tender.

175
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,832
And they will remain fragile,

176
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,332
Till those bittersweet memories,

177
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,582
Keep tingling them.

178
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,499
True, we've forgotten,

179
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,707
Where we left our shoes..

180
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,332
But now it seems,
we don't need them anymore.

181
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,374
Liked it?

182
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,040
Did you understand it?

183
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,124
We should've watched
the whole film..

184
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,707
Come to Bombay.

185
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,457
I'll show you
Paris Hilton's sex tape.

186
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,165
I'll miss you guys..

187
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,749
We too, pal.

188
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,832
Okay, then..

189
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,790
Take care..

190
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,874
You look after yourself.

191
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,415
You too

192
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,124
Take care, man.

193
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,082
Take him home carefully, Moustache.

194
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,249
Does your wife know
about the woman..

195
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,249
..whose blouse you had
your hand in?

196
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,415
Idiot..

197
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,082
What?

198
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,665
Go.

199
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:36,082
The beauty has vanished

200
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:45,415
Like smoke into thin air.

201
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:55,665
Then, we were lost in our dreams,

202
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:05,749
Now we face the unknown.

203
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,915
Is life over?

204
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:25,749
Or is it about to begin?

205
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,665
Is this nightfall?

206
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,707
Or is it a new dawn?

207
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,040
Is life over?

208
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:45,415
Or is it about to begin?

209
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,915
Is this nightfall?

210
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:54,624
Or is it a new dawn?

211
00:16:55,208 --> 00:17:01,790
Will the future bring comfort?

212
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:10,332
Or will bring us to a crossroad?

213
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:22,374
Who knows what lies ahead..

214
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,290
Has come on platform no. 2.

215
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,832
That's my bed.

216
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,499
Who is he?

217
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,707
Your brother.

218
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,040
My brother?

219
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,999
After your mother died..

220
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,707
I got married again.

221
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,582
It didn't work out..

222
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:07,874
Move..

223
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,624
Get up.

224
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,082
This is my bed.

225
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,832
Get up or l'll whack you so hard
you'll go to the bathroom and cry.

226
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,499
Get up!

227
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,165
Come here.

228
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,665
This is my cupboard.

229
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:09,624
Listen pipsqueak. This cupboard
was mine before you were born..

230
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:14,707
Now that I'm back, this cupboard,
this table, this bed..

231
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,624
Everything is mine.
Nothing is yours.

232
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:18,999
What is your name?

233
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,207
Arjun

234
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,457
Go and get him.

235
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,457
Sir is calling you.

236
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,665
Sir?

237
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,290
You call Papa 'Sir'?

238
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,290
Tell 'Sir' that l'm coming.

239
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,624
I'm coming.

240
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,332
Sir is getting angry.

241
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,999
Next time you'll have no hair left.

242
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:48,999
Little brother..

243
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,165
Big Brother..

244
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,624
Coming. Coming.

245
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,332
You're slow..

246
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,457
Good evening Uncle.

247
00:25:57,541 --> 00:26:00,082
Here.. Here also..

248
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,040
And who is this?

249
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:08,040
As big as your uncle..
- Hello.

250
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:11,374
His voice broke..

251
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,957
Good evening Auntie.
- Good evening.

252
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,957
He is so handsome!

253
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,499
Handsome my foot.

254
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,540
Good evening to Auntie,

255
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,290
And only a 'hello' for me?

256
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:22,707
Well done..

257
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,374
Where is my hug?

258
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,665
Good to see you.

259
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,915
Listen..

260
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,790
Heard you were a bad boy at school..

261
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,832
Who was she?
- Nobody.

262
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,374
I went to see a film with friends.

263
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,957
At Rivoli?
- Yes.

264
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,874
We used to see lots of films there.

265
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,499
Good one?

266
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,665
Don't know. We had to run back.
- Why

267
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,499
Our warden was there.

268
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,332
Who?
- Rathod.

269
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,457
Big moustache.
- Yes.

270
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,332
Who made him a warden?

271
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,915
He used to be a peon.

272
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,540
Not him.. His son.

273
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,915
He has a moustache too?

274
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,332
Yes.

275
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,040
Come in. Our moustache is watching.

276
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,499
So big man

277
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,540
What now?

278
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,207
College
- College!

279
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:10,082
Everyone goes to college.

280
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:11,832
What will you study?

281
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:13,957
Arts, Literature.

282
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,499
Why not science?

283
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:16,874
I want to be a writer.

284
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,290
Wow!

285
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,540
What will you write?

286
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,915
Poems, novels, stories, or jokes?

287
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,665
Everything
- Nothing.

288
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,499
He'll write nothing

289
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:34,082
He will study
engineering and work in my factory.

290
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:39,874
He wants to study literature.

291
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,374
What's wrong with that?

292
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:45,332
Writers are respected these days.

293
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,249
Respect won't feed him..

294
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,290
Writers only grow
their hair like girls,

295
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,124
wear a kurta, carry a bag..

296
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,749
And think they're brilliant.

297
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:55,790
But they're not.

298
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:59,749
Then they die. Either from hunger.

299
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,082
Or as frustrated alcoholics.

300
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:08,999
If he lives in my house
he has to obey my rules.

301
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,165
I don't want to work in a factory.

302
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,499
Did I ask for your opinion?

303
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:14,999
Did anyone?

304
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,457
What are you staring at?

305
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,624
I'll whack you so hard your
eyes will fall in your plate.

306
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,124
Lower your eyes and eat your food.

307
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,374
See how cheeky he is Jimmy?

308
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,124
What would our father have done,

309
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,624
If we had behaved like this.

310
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:46,457
He would've melted our bones
along with steel in the furnace.

311
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,832
And if we'd been kicked out
of the best school in India..

312
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:52,790
Do you know
what he would have done?

313
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:59,915
We'd be out on the streets
till we proved our worth.

314
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,082
If you don't behave yourself

315
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,874
I'll treat you the same way.

316
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:08,999
At least your father would've
met you once in eight years..

317
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,457
No, no.. He's just a child..

318
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,874
Child? He's insolent.

319
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,207
Let me go..

320
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,290
Hardly has a moustache..

321
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,374
And talks back to his father.

322
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,040
I'm talking to you..

323
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,415
How dare you..

324
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,624
Stop, Stop.. You'll kill him.

325
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,790
Let him go..

326
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,915
Enough.

327
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,249
Why do you talk to him like that?

328
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,790
He doesn't understand any other way.

329
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,624
He brought you into this world.

330
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,249
Mummy did that..

331
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,165
He is your father.

332
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:21,957
What kind of a father is he?

333
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,999
He abandoned me for eight years..

334
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:30,790
One letter a year which
sounded like the news on TV.

335
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:34,249
"Everything is fine here.
I got your results..

336
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,040
".. you could do better."

337
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,874
I had even forgotten his face..

338
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:42,707
Saw him at the station
and wondered who he was..

339
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,582
I'm his son,
not a fixed deposit in a bank.

340
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,374
I'll clean toilets all my life
but l won't work for him.

341
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,624
Come on, get up.

342
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,332
Every father wants his son to
grow up to be just like himself.

343
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:19,540
Give him a chance.

344
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,124
He might understand.

345
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,165
I know that you'll do
whatever it is you want..

346
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,999
But first stand on your feet.

347
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,165
Then be whatever you want to
be; Write or clean toilets.

348
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,207
Come..

349
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,624
The food's getting cold..

350
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,499
Come. For my sake..

351
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,124
You can't deny a fat man his food..

352
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:54,749
I'm starving.

353
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:56,540
Come on.

354
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:17,790
Bring Arjun upstairs.

355
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:37,207
Arjun get up.

356
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,665
Arjun!

357
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,832
Let's get some facts straight..

358
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,582
This is my house..

359
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:58,790
If you stay here, you will
have to live by my rules.

360
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,165
First rule

361
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:06,457
Call me Sir as Arjun does.

362
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:11,290
What did you call
your seniors at school?

363
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:14,624
Sir

364
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:19,040
What happened at Jimmy's
should never happen again.

365
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:21,749
You will never..

366
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:25,540
Ever misbehave with me again..

367
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,665
You will not raise your voice..

368
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,749
And you will only do as I say.

369
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,124
Understood?

370
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,332
Okay

371
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,915
The word is 'Yes'

372
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:42,957
Yes

373
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:44,582
Yes what?

374
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,374
Yes Sir

375
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:55,665
Give up your dreams of
being a writer.

376
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,207
It will not happen.

377
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,249
Stop flying.

378
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,499
Keep your feet on the ground.

379
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,332
Do you understand me?

380
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,249
Yes Sir.

381
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,290
You will come to the
factory with me from tomorrow.

382
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,040
You'll work there till lunch
then leave for engineering college.

383
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,499
Thanks to your school record..

384
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:22,874
I've had to beg
a lot of favours for you.

385
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,707
If you let me down again..

386
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,915
I'll slit your throat.

387
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:31,915
Do you understand?

388
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,415
Did Sir shout at you?

389
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:54,540
He always shouts at me.

390
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,332
Or beats me.

391
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:20,749
Be down in five minutes.

392
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,249
Arjun.

393
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,915
I'll show you the sights
of Jamshedpur while we jog.

394
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:41,374
When we return, we will
race from there to here.

395
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,540
But I don't want to race.

396
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:45,707
Has anyone asked you?

397
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,249
Lets go.

398
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,374
And you?

399
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,374
I can't run.

400
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:02,040
Why?

401
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:45,249
Chotu.
- Brother..

402
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:48,749
Got your son running too?

403
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,040
Run Rohan run

404
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,290
Come on! Catch up!

405
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,124
Shall I come too?

406
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:54,665
I'm coming..

407
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,082
Run.

408
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:38,665
You know who this is?

409
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:40,957
Sumant Moolgaonkar!

410
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,374
He made this park

411
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,499
Come on..

412
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,124
Lets go.

413
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,290
Come on..

414
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,665
J.N. Tata.

415
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,499
J.R.D. Tata

416
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,249
JUSCO

417
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,999
P.N. Bose.

418
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:20,665
St. George's Church

419
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,415
Come on.

420
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,040
Timing?

421
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,707
Forty one minutes.

422
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,374
Good.

423
00:38:52,708 --> 00:39:06,999
Disgraceful!

424
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,874
Listen

425
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:15,332
Study well

426
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,249
I shouldn't get any complaints.

427
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,874
Okay Sir.

428
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,874
This is my son Rohan.

429
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,082
He's been at Bishop Cotton School.

430
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,457
He will be joining us from today..

431
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:14,207
Let's hope he'll
work as hard as we do.

432
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,457
And be a good co-worker.

433
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:22,749
He is my son, but at home.
Not here.

434
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:28,707
If anyone has a complaint
about him..

435
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,999
Please feel free to voice it.

436
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,124
Understood?

437
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,040
Now get to your work.

438
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,999
Come Mr. Rao.

439
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,249
You too

440
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,832
Mr. Rao is the manager here.

441
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,415
He will brief you about your work.

442
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:45,832
He is older than you.

443
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:50,499
Shall we?

444
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,332
Just a moment..

445
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,457
Best of luck.

446
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,124
An engineer always faces the task

447
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:19,624
Of describing shapes
of objects on paper.

448
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,374
The paper, through which an
engineer conveys the details

449
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:27,957
Of a machine or object is
called Engineering Drawing.

450
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,374
In order to present the exact
size and shape of the object,

451
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:35,915
The lines are drawn perpendicular
to the planes of the paper

452
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:40,749
From various angles of the object,
giving an image on the paper.

453
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:44,207
These are called
Orthographic projections.

454
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,499
In the figure 10.1

455
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:51,457
All three sides, that
is front, side, top..

456
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,124
Can be seen together.

457
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:56,415
When the projections are
parallel to one another..

458
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:59,290
And also perpendicular
to the picture plane,

459
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:04,374
The projection thus forming a plane
is called Orthographic Projection.

460
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,374
When a surface, front, side or top..

461
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:11,415
Of the object is to
be depicted separately

462
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:14,249
It is drawn in the
true shape and proportion.

463
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:18,582
By assuming the object
placed in a particular position,

464
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:22,207
Where only the surface
to be drawn is visible.

465
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:26,499
The projection is the representation
of the shape of an object.

466
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,999
On a plane or surface..

467
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:38,499
Don't you know that
style is taxed in college?

468
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,707
Now you know..

469
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,624
Will you cut your hair now?

470
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,499
What shall we do with him?

471
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:45,665
Sit ups.

472
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,915
Fifty sit
- ups.

473
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,499
Go down. All the way.

474
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:51,832
Stand.

475
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,624
Who's counting? My father?

476
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:55,665
He asked you to sit not
to waste time.

477
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:57,332
What are you laughing at?

478
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,457
You can't escape me now!

479
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,540
I'm big, I'm small,

480
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,707
I'm stronger, I have a gun.

481
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:33,790
How will you kill me?

482
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:20,124
Put it on my account.

483
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,749
Come on. Lay out the food.

484
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,540
Why don't we keep a cook?

485
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,499
Will you pay?

486
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:02,457
And a maid for Arjun..

487
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:04,082
Yes, you can keep one.

488
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:06,540
When you earn, you can keep one.

489
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,290
Maid, cook, whatever..

490
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,249
There's a recession on,

491
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:16,957
Do you understand what that means?

492
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:20,874
Go. Call Arjun.

493
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:27,957
Sir is calling you for dinner.

494
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,540
He's coming.

495
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,832
Yes!

496
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,040
Rum and coke.

497
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:49,332
I remember, I had chased him..

498
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:58,540
Do you know my name?

499
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:00,540
No

500
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:02,582
Mishter Apu.

501
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:04,540
Mister Apu.

502
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,790
Mishter
- Mister..

503
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:10,999
Mishter..
- Mishter. - Appu. - Appu.

504
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:14,374
We are your seniors,
you know that don't you?

505
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:16,707
Yes.

506
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:22,457
Then you also know that a
senior can do anything he likes.

507
00:52:24,416 --> 00:52:25,707
What shall we do with him?

508
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:27,374
Sing a song?

509
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,290
What the fuck fatso!

510
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,457
You always make people sing.

511
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:34,707
He makes everyone sing.

512
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:37,082
You want to make it to lndian Idol?

513
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,207
Why do you keep asking me? Ask him.
He never says anything.

514
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:41,124
Okay. You.
What shall we do with him?

515
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:44,665
What will you do?

516
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,624
You understand sit-ups?

517
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:48,915
No

518
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,124
Look, like this..

519
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,624
Sit down and then up..

520
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,082
Sing a song on sit-ups.

521
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:57,957
Sit-up fatty..

523
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:04,374
Hands on your ears..

524
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:06,290
Sit and then up.

525
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,707
Please sing.
Sing a song on sit up.

526
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:10,165
I know you know a song.

527
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:13,624
You're sitting so quietly,
there's something on your mind..

528
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:16,374
It's our first meeting,
it's our first meeting..

529
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:25,665
Well sung..

530
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,832
You making fun of me?
- No..

531
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,999
Are you making fun of me?
- Fun? I'm not making fun..

532
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,999
In front of this boy.

533
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,165
No man, you sang well..

534
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,540
He laughed at me.

535
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:38,040
Don't laugh

536
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:39,249
You're making fun of me fatso.

537
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:41,249
No l'm not.

538
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:42,832
He always does this.

539
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:44,040
Why are you getting angry?

540
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,165
Who have you come to bully?

541
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,082
Him or me?

542
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:49,415
Let it go.

543
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,624
No l won't..

544
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,165
Don't listen to fatso. He's mad.

545
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,582
If he's mad he shouldn't be here.
- Calm down.

546
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,082
Will you like it if I made
fun of you in front of the boy?

547
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,415
Listen to me..

548
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,665
What did I say..
- Let it go man.

549
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,207
Let it go man. We're friends.

550
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:05,207
Let it go. Let's drink.

551
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,249
You can't afford to buy booze.

552
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:08,999
You live off this guy.
How will you buy me booze?

553
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:11,749
How can I live off him?
He wears shorts.

554
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,082
Listen to that.

555
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,665
You just eat all day fatso.

556
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,290
You shut up. Let's drink.

557
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:19,665
Who's buying drinks?

558
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,207
He is.

559
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,207

Where is it?

562
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:32,957
You must feel cold then?

563
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,332
Here?

564
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,665
From the hills aren't you?

565
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:41,624
You know what fatso's father does?
- What?

566
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:45,540
He sells panties & bras.

567
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:47,415
Sits on a stool all day..

568
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,040
With bras and panties.

569
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,790
My friends and I
always wanted to do that.

570
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,457
Lingerie shop!

571
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:56,874

Cheers!

575
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,790
Now that you've left school..

576
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:09,707
Your dad must be breathing fire..

577
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:11,582
He must be saying..

578
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:15,790
No more studies. Waste of time.
Join family business.

579
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18,124
How do you know that?

580
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:22,374
All small town fathers are alike.

581
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:24,707
Family business..

582
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:26,124
Very good, very good..

583
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,374
Dream business..

584
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,332
Very bad, very bad..

585
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:32,749
What' your dream business?

586
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,540
I want to be a writer.

587
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,165
Writer!

588
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,040
Javed Akhtar.

589
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:43,040
Written something?
- Yes.

590
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,707
Let's hear it..

591
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,874
He'll eat every strand of your hair

592
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:55,915
If you let him,
he'll eat days of the year

593
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:59,707
He'll eat the food of
a starving man.

594
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:02,874
And the last wishes of
a dying man.

595
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,999
He'll eat Laloo's children

596
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:07,249
And the Naxal core.

597
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,915
He'll eat the fun of youth

598
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,874
And the warmth of old age..

599
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:14,582
He'll eat the walk of
a woman with no shame.

600
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:16,415
And if given a chance..

601
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,457
He'll eat all your
thoughts as well.

602
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:25,124
Even a tortoise is faster,
Fatso master..

603
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:28,624
He is a gas
- blaster, fatso master..

604
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:31,832
Fatso master is a total disaster..

605
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:35,040
Total Disaster is Fatso master.

606
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38,665
Speaks from his ass, fatso master.

607
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:41,915
Drinks only Fosters, Fatso master.

608
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,582
Equals a hundred elephants,
Fatso master.

609
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:48,915
Stomach or Equator? Fatso master.

610
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,499
Larger than extra large,
Fatso master.

611
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,624
Original loo breaker,
Fatso master.

612
00:56:55,708 --> 00:57:00,207
The Titanic's anchor,
Fatso master.

613
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,749
Disgraceful.

614
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,957
Let's go.

615
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:03,582
Careful with the steps. Don't fall.

616
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:05,124
Okay. Okay.

617
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:07,582
Leave me, I'm fine..

618
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,832
Wrong side..

619
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,374
No.. you sit here. He'll drive.

620
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:14,957
Who'll drive? Rohan will.

621
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,665
Yes, he'll drive, you go to sleep

622
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,082
Him?

623
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,582
You sleep, he'll drive.

624
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:24,207
He can drive?
- Of course he can.

625
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:25,582
No, I'll drive.

626
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:29,749
Please sit. Let Rohan drive.

627
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,207
You go to sleep.

628
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:33,082
He can drive?
- Of course he can.

629
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,332
Please go to sleep.

630
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:50,457
When did you learn to drive?

631
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,957
I drove Mr. Pasli's car during
the holidays.

632
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,457
What else don't I know about you?

633
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:12,665
Speak up!

634
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:15,624
Do you smoke?

635
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:17,790
No

636
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:19,707
Alcohol?

637
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,207
No

638
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:24,165
Must have a girlfriend?

639
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,499
Have not.

640
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,707
Have you had sex?

641
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:36,124
No

642
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,540
No sex!?

643
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:39,832
No! Go to sleep.

644
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:41,290
Lower your voice.

645
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:43,457
Idiot..

646
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,540
Hasn't even had sex yet.

647
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:31,874
I had so many plans for you..

648
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:37,582
To send you to England
to become a engineer..

649
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:41,165
But you've ruined everything.

650
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:45,290
Which college will take you?

651
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:49,207
Will any college take you?

652
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,207
Will they?
- No!

653
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:57,999
Can't even take a little pain eh?

654
01:03:58,416 --> 01:03:59,790
Not even this much?

655
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,499
Idiot.

656
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,040
You're not a boy. You're a girl.

657
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,207
You look like a girl too.

658
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:20,082
Just like your mother.

659
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:26,124
She loved you very much.

660
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:30,540
More than me..

661
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,874
Understood?

662
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,165
Get lost.

663
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:49,790
I came to see you at school..

664
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:54,665
Met your principal too.

665
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:58,332
You were playing football..

666
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,290
You looked so happy,
I didn't want to disturb you..

667
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,457
And besides..

668
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:11,499
I had nothing nice to say.

669
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:15,415
Idiot girl!

670
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,915
Haven't even had sex..

671
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:21,832
Leave me alone!

672
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,207
I'm okay now.

673
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:27,999
Girl!

674
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,957
What?

675
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,707
He was the original drunkard.

676
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:51,957
Drunk all day long.

677
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,457
The first thing
he did every morning.

678
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:58,999
Eat booze. Drink booze. Piss booze.

679
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:03,415
Sold my mother's wedding necklace
for a drink.

680
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:07,665
He'd curse and beat
her when she protested.

681
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,915
My sister and I could only watch.

682
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:15,165
One day I came home and
he was beating her again.

683
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:17,874
My mother isn't
a bag of dirty laundry.

684
01:06:18,916 --> 01:06:20,332
I got pissed off..

685
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:22,790
I became a hero and
caught him by the collar.

686
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:26,249
"Enough of your drama!" l shouted.

687
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:30,124
And threw him out of the house.

688
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:33,207
Told him never to look back.

689
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:38,707
Then I slammed the door shut
and turned towards my mother.

690
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:41,624
Thought she would embrace me.

691
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,290
But got a tight slap instead.

692
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:51,707
Then she led that moron back in..

693
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:59,332
And said, "Whatever happens,
he is my husband and you're his son."

694
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,999
I became an orphan that day.

695
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:08,832
Left home..

696
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:13,624
But didn't leave Jamshedpur.
My biggest mistake.

697
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,874
Fatso, before all this
heartache kills me, let's fight..

698
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:29,749
No man.
- Come on fatso.

699
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:31,290
Let it go.
- It's been ages.

700
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:33,165
No, Apu. Apu sit. Apu, don't go.

701
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,749
Apu wait.
- Apu.

702
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:39,582
Apu.. - I've been
playing this since childhood.

703
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,374
Who is this?

704
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,915
This isn't carrom son.
Go play Ludo.

705
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,249
What's he doing?

706
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,665
Don't ask.

707
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:53,582
This isn't carrom son.

708
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:55,999
Really? Is it that funny?

709
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:57,624
Shall I make you cry instead?

710
01:07:57,958 --> 01:07:59,415
What did you say? Make me cry?

711
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,415
Yes. l'll make you cry.

712
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,665
Where do you stay?

713
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,499
Wait, wait.. What did you say?

714
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:05,707
I'll make you cry.

715
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:06,874
You'll make me cry?
- Yes.

716
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,165
Do you know who I am?
- Who are you?

717
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:12,290
Don't you recognize me?
- Who are you?

718
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:15,374
Are you new here?
- Are you?

719
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,165
Why are you wasting your
time with this mad man?

720
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,707
See how he's talking to me!

721
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:20,957
Who are you?
- I'm Aseem Khettry's son.

722
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:23,082
Sure you're not his driver's son?
- And now you're dead!

723
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:26,207
You!
- Hey, let go off him!

724
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:31,999
You Idiot!
- Stop.

725
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:48,749
Messing with Khettrys' son?
Go play carrom idiot.

726
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,582
Stop!
- Take this.

727
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:58,749
Fatso, he's calling the police.
Let's get out quick.

728
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:10,999
Lets go.
- Wait.

729
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:13,082
No, no, no..

730
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,832
Let's get out.

731
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,332
Come on Shiv..

732
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,999
Run Fatso

733
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:53,124
Open the door. Quick.

734
01:09:56,166 --> 01:09:58,124
Open the door.

735
01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:01,124
Quick. Open, open, open..

736
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:14,665
Get lost! Blow me
you fuckers! Get lost!

737
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:27,457
What did you tell him?

738
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,957
I said, " Look son..

739
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:34,040
Play pool with me
instead of with these fools.

740
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,749
I can pot the ball without
a stick."

741
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,124
You're lying.

742
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:42,249
No l swear.
Then he told me to get lost..

743
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:46,332
So l said, "This is why
you're here putting balls in..

744
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:49,040
And your wife does the
same at home with other men."

745
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:52,665
You never said that..
- He's lying..

746
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,374
I really did say it

747
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:58,082
Then he kept staring at me.
So l said, "What are you looking at?

748
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:02,457
Want to see your wife's tattoo?
It's across both cheeks of my ass."

749
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,124
You said that?

750
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,874
Balls you said that. Fuck off.

751
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,374
I really did!

752
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,374
But it was fun..

753
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,624
Fatso doesn't believe me, eh?

754
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:16,124
Apu Don't. Stop it.

755
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:26,207
Hey it's raining.
- Rain!

756
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,832
Filled with the joy of life,

757
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:40,624
Bursting with delight

758
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:43,749
We never asked for this moment

759
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:48,124
we stole it

760
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:52,374
This is how we will live...

761
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:38,082
If we had run faster
we wouldn't have been expelled.

762
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:40,999
Rohan?
- No, it's the Moustache.

763
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:42,749
Look behind you.
I'm standing there with my moped.

764
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,082
Rohan, how are you?

765
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:48,374
Manu.. How are you?

766
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:51,082
I'm good.
Why are you awake this late?

767
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,582
Jamshedpur has a new disco?

768
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:57,165
No man. I sneaked out to
drink with some friends.

769
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,165
Grown up already?

770
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:02,290
Oh shut up. We got
into a fight as well.

771
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,415
Beat up two guys. Had a blast.

772
01:13:05,916 --> 01:13:07,332
You're mad..

773
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:09,165
Totally mad

774
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,624
You okay?
- Totally fine.

775
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,207
How's your father?

776
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,999
Not father. Call him 'Sir'.

777
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:19,957
Makes me work at his
factory and study engineering..

778
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:22,124
Says I should study.
There's a recession on..

779
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,874
Do you know what recession means?

780
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:26,040
I don't know what it means.

781
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:31,624
Even if I fail all my
exams he can't do anything

782
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:33,415
He can't do..

783
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:38,665
I also have a younger half
- brother.

784
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,790
A six-year-old brother who
I didn't even know existed.

785
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,374
Are you okay?

786
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:48,374
I'm fine. I really am.
Meet the new town drunk.

787
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:51,582
Enough about me.
How are Vikram and Benoy?

788
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:53,499
Everyone is fine..

789
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:57,457
Vikram's Dad has a new restaurant.
Vikram is working there.

790
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,999
Benoy's in art school.
He's changed completely.

791
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:05,790
Wears a kurta, quotes Tagore,
shows a new girl his room everyday.

792
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,124
Why? Is it a special room?

793
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:09,165
Yes.. it has a bed..

794
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:17,040
And you?
- I'm fine. Looking for work.

795
01:14:17,416 --> 01:14:20,165
Dad still ignores me
and reads his news..

796
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:25,874
And mom sulks as if dad caught her
watching the Kanti Shah's "Grapes".

797
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:29,790
Are you happy?
- I am..

798
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:32,915
And you?
- Me too..

799
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:34,665
You sure?

800
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:36,499
I'm sure..

801
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:39,082
I miss you guys a lot.

802
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:42,832
Come to Bombay. Tell your father
we'll take care of everything.

803
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:44,665
Even you'll have fun.

804
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:47,124
I will come. For sure.

805
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:51,249
Listen, I don't have much money,
I'll call you some other time.

806
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:54,332
Tell Vikram and Benoy
that I said hi.

807
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:56,207
I will.. and you take care..

808
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,165
I will.
- And keep calling..

809
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,999
I will.. bye..
- Ok. Bye

810
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:15,207
Bhairav Singh

811
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:18,290
I am coming to get you..

812
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,624
Do you understand recession?

813
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,915
Disgraceful.

814
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:56,415
Was this picnic your idea?

815
01:16:57,166 --> 01:17:00,207
Your father isn't as bad
as you make him out to be.

816
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:04,665
I just don't get him.
Sometimes a demon, sometimes a lamb.

817
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:08,874
Spoken like a true writer..

818
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,415
I'm not talking like a writer..

819
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:15,165
Your mother would have been
proud if she were alive today.

820
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:17,499
She always wanted you to be
a writer.

821
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,332
Really?
- Yes.

822
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:23,999
She never told your
father but she told me..

823
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:27,082
How she would've loved that line..

824
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:36,540
Sometimes a demon, sometimes a lamb.

825
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,999
Stop it!

826
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:52,124
I have an idea..

827
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,249
Let's hear one of Rohan's poems..

828
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,957
He's written a full-length novel..

829
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:09,457
I'm not asking you
to change your mind..

830
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:13,415
Listen to it. If you don't like it,
don't applaud.

831
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:18,999
Come on big man, go for it.

832
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:28,207
If you could see past the shore,
You would know what I think.

833
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:33,832
If you could hear the waves,
You would know what I think.

834
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:39,874
Remove your veil of obstinacy,
And look beyond the window.

835
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:45,332
If you could see through convention,
You would know what I think.

836
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:51,624
If you had faith in yourself as I do,
You could walk with me a while..

837
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:57,165
If you could see the colors I do,
You could walk with me a while.

838
01:18:57,875 --> 01:19:00,374
If you want to touch the sky as l do,

839
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,082
Then your desires would come alive.

840
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:08,332
Then, in my next life,
we could fly together a while.

841
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,124
Forget it

842
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,165
A woman's magazine will publish it..

843
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,290
..or someone will drop
a coin in your begging bowl.

844
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:17,332
Hello.

845
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:18,790
Please.. sit..

846
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:21,332
Hello. How are you?
- Please, have a seat.

847
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,082
How was the journey?

848
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:25,374
Okay. Our flight got a bit delayed.

849
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:28,374
I made these for you to read.

850
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:53,332
They're good..

851
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:00,040
I'm glad you came today.

852
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,290
I'm off to Kolkata tomorrow..

853
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:05,332
Let me show you the workshop.

854
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:07,207
Sure.

855
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,499
Hello?
- Is that Mr. Singh?

856
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:18,790
Yes? - I'm Mrs. Batra here,
Principal of Arjun's school.

857
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,457
Yes Mrs. Batra, tell me.

858
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:23,915
There's been another problem
with your son, Arjun, this morning..

859
01:21:24,333 --> 01:21:27,790
We'd like you to come here
and take him back home today.

860
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,749
I'm in a meeting right now.
Can I come post lunch?

861
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:34,499
No Mr. Singh.
This is an extremely serious problem.

862
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:36,290
I know Mrs. Batra but..

863
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:38,749
Keep him in your office
for sometime.

864
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:40,124
Mr. Singh please understand

865
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:42,915
I cannot allow Arjun to
remain in school today.

866
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,832
Okay, I'm coming.

867
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:47,040
In half an hour?

868
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:48,457
Yes Mrs. Batra.
I'm coming right now.

869
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:49,832
Thank you, Mr. Singh.

870
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:57,374
I'm sorry, but l have to
rush to my son's school.

871
01:21:57,583 --> 01:22:00,874
He's been unwell
recently and it got worse today.

872
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:05,207
But Mr. Rao will show
you around the workshop

873
01:22:05,416 --> 01:22:07,499
No problem.
We'll come back tomorrow.

874
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:09,915
We have other factories
to see today.

875
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,707
But I told you,
I have to be in Kolkata tomorrow.

876
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:13,957
I've committed it.

877
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:16,499
I am sorry.
We can't stay any longer.

878
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:20,290
Anyway. We'll meet again.
Some other time?

879
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:21,957
Okay..

880
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:23,457
Let's go.

881
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,790
What happened?

882
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:56,124
Get in the car.

883
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:16,165
What happened?

884
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:18,957
His blood pressure is very low.

885
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,332
Seems like he's had a bad fall.

886
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,374
There could be internal bleeding.

887
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:26,957
I'll have to check. We'll keep him
under observation for a few days.

888
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:28,207
How many days?

889
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:30,499
Four to five days.
- Four to five days?

890
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:33,957
Don't worry.
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

891
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:35,832
Thank you.

892
01:23:39,208 --> 01:23:40,415
How did it happen?

893
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,249
Fell down the stairs.

894
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:44,540
How?

895
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:47,624
How should I know? He just fell.

896
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:53,374
You go home. I'll stay here.

897
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:55,540
I'm also staying.

898
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,540
What happened to your results?

899
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:04,374
I passed.
- Marks?

900
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:07,957
They're good.
- Good.

901
01:24:15,791 --> 01:24:17,874
I'm going to Kolkata
for three days.

902
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,999
If all goes well,
I'll return with a few contracts.

903
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:25,874
You stay here with Arjun.

904
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:28,290
And don't leave him alone, okay?

905
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:29,665
Yes Sir.

906
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:36,165
And..

907
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:38,915
No need to inform Uncle and Auntie.

908
01:24:39,916 --> 01:24:43,374
I've told them that both of
you are going with me. Okay?

909
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:44,832
Yes Sir.

910
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,165
Fine.

911
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:58,874
Have you eaten?

912
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:07,832
Sir has gone to kolkata.

913
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,415
Aren't you happy?

914
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:21,249
What happened yesterday?

915
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:50,915
For you.

916
01:25:58,375 --> 01:25:59,540
And these..

917
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:01,457
If you feel like reading.

918
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,332
This has my poems and stories.

919
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:13,915
Would you like to hear some?

920
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:19,499
Hello Arjun.

921
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,415
Are you feeling well today?

922
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:23,832
Good.

923
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:30,957
Could you change his clothes?

924
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:32,749
Yes.
- Thank you.

925
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,249
What is it?

926
01:27:07,416 --> 01:27:08,540
What now?

927
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:12,165
Lunch was to be served by 12.30.
Its 1 :00 p. m now.

928
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:14,207
Please don't shout.
It's bad for you.

929
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,957
Yes I know.

930
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,374
I can get a heart attack.

931
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:19,457
But if I die of hunger before that?

932
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:22,040
I'll go and get your food just now.

933
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,540
Get it fast..

934
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:26,249
Corpses don't eat.

935
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:32,499
Why don't you laugh?

936
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:34,999
I am 80 years old..

937
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:37,374
Grandfather of six.

938
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:39,165
Great grandfather of two..

939
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:40,790
Can't l shout?

940
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:44,707
Laugh.

941
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:01,290
Would you like to listen to a poem?

942
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:13,665
Chandu's Cycle.

943
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:16,540
Chandu's cycle was just like Chandu..

944
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:19,749
As it moved, it crickered and
crankered, just like Chandu.

945
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:23,957
The handle was as light
as Chandu's slender hand.

946
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:27,582
The pedals were as thin
as Chandu's spindle legs.

947
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:31,582
The seat was as broad
as Chandu's huge behind.

948
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:35,249
The carrier was as small
as Chandu's short career.

949
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,707
Yet it was Chandu's true friend.

950
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,790
Was always loyal to Chandu.

951
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:43,915
It took Chandu's
heavy weight with ease.

952
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:48,207
One day the cycle broke down.

953
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:50,290
Seeing a bull charging at him,

954
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,999
Chandu dropped it hard.

955
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:55,582
When Monty Mechanic
could not save the cycle,

956
01:29:56,083 --> 01:29:59,332
Chandu's father sold
it to a scrap dealer.

957
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:03,207
Chandu drowned himself
in his books.

958
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:06,624
Like he had an old dream
to fulfill.

959
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:08,582
Later, when Chandu grew up,

960
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:10,374
He used his very first salary..

961
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:14,290
And got himself a new cycle..

962
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:16,499
But..

963
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:17,749
But?

964
01:30:17,833 --> 01:30:21,499
This cycle too was
just like Chandu..

965
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,249
It still crickered and
crankered as it moved around.

966
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:26,499
It's seat was..

967
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:28,540
As broad as Chandu's huge behind.

968
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:30,415
The carrier was as small..

969
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,499
As Chandu's short career.

970
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:36,457
You wrote that?

971
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:39,290
Yes
- Wow..

972
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:41,207
Very good.

973
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,499
Very inspiring!

974
01:30:43,666 --> 01:30:46,457
Thank you.
- Keep writing like this, son.

975
01:30:46,791 --> 01:30:48,332
Keep writing.

976
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:50,540
Write.

977
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:04,165
How many friends do
you have in school?

978
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:08,415
Seven.

979
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,749
Their names?

980
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:10,957
Apurva,

981
01:31:11,208 --> 01:31:12,874
Sunny, Raju,

982
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,582
Batuk, Kunal..

983
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:16,582
Kunal.. Kunal.

984
01:31:16,666 --> 01:31:17,999
Veer.

985
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:19,540
And?

986
01:31:19,625 --> 01:31:20,790
And..

987
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,374
That's only six.

988
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:26,957
And one more..

989
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,040
Tushar.

990
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,874
You have so many friends.

991
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,790
I have only three.

992
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:35,582
What was your mother like?

993
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:38,957
My mother was very nice.

994
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:41,665
She loved me a lot.

995
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:45,374
She smelled wonderful
when I'd cuddle up to sleep.

996
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:47,624
Just like a mother.

997
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:51,624
I don't know
what my mother was like.

998
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:53,624
Do you know her?

999
01:31:54,916 --> 01:31:56,040
No.

1000
01:32:03,666 --> 01:32:05,040
Mr. Poet..

1001
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,874
Why don't you ever laugh?

1002
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:11,040
Yes.

1003
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:13,374
Look at you now. You look so good.

1004
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,540
When do we hear something new?

1005
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:17,832
Tonight?

1006
01:32:17,916 --> 01:32:18,999
In the night?

1007
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:21,290
Do you also write at night?

1008
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:22,499
Sometimes.

1009
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:23,915
Beware of the night..

1010
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:25,582
You see..

1011
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:27,332
The day destroys the night,

1012
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:29,040
Night divides the day.

1013
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:30,624
Try to run,

1014
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:32,124
Try to hide..

1015
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:33,665
Break on through to
the other side.

1016
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:39,374
This is the true
story of three friends..

1017
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:42,249
Muninder, Benoy and Rohit.

1018
01:32:42,708 --> 01:32:46,249
The kingdom where they
lived would select..

1019
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:48,707
..the smartest boys for training.

1020
01:32:48,791 --> 01:32:53,207
Years later, they would join
the King's prestigious army.

1021
01:32:53,583 --> 01:32:57,290
But nobody really knew what
went on inside the castle.

1022
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:01,415
Their parents didn't know
that the King's evil minister.

1023
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,582
Was brain-washing the kids
and turning them into robots.

1024
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:06,332
Is it a true story?

1025
01:33:06,416 --> 01:33:07,540
Yes.

1026
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:10,374
The wicked man's name was Rathod.

1027
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:11,582
Rathod!

1028
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:12,999
Yes, Rathod.

1029
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:19,207
Vikreet and Benoy were
with the full Robot Army..

1030
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:21,582
Muninder and the kids
were due any minute now..

1031
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:24,957
Rohit was worried.
They hadn't come yet.

1032
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:29,582
He turned around. And froze.
A terrified look came into his eyes.

1033
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:32,249
He saw someone
coming through the tunnel.

1034
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,499
Someone was coming from the tunnel..

1035
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:35,874
Who was coming?

1036
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,332
Who was it?

1037
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:49,457
We'll finish tomorrow..
- Now!

1038
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:57,124
34 in Chemistry

1039
01:34:58,291 --> 01:35:00,790
20 in Physics. 1 5 in Maths.

1040
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:03,374
You told me you passed.

1041
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:09,290
Is this a joke to you?

1042
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:13,290
I thought you'd finally become
serious about your studies.

1043
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:17,790
You're narrating
stories to half-dead people.

1044
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:20,040
Just to hear them tell you
what a good writer you are.

1045
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,582
What are you staring at?

1046
01:35:23,291 --> 01:35:24,499
Lower your eyes.

1047
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:28,207
If this wasn't a hospital,
I would skin you right now.

1048
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:32,540
I'm not going to
forget this in a hurry.

1049
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:37,540
Come home. I'll make
sure l get an answer.

1050
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:46,457
What did Sir say?

1051
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:49,415
Sir said that he will send
me to the hospital as well.

1052
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,665
Why?

1053
01:35:51,416 --> 01:35:52,874
Because I failed my exams.

1054
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:56,707
So you'll go back
to boarding school?

1055
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:58,082
No. Why?

1056
01:35:58,166 --> 01:36:02,832
Sir said if l don't pass,
he'll send me to a boarding school.

1057
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:21,874
What happened that day?

1058
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,582
Sir hit me.

1059
01:37:26,208 --> 01:37:27,332
Why?

1060
01:37:27,416 --> 01:37:31,999
Two boys were teasing me at school.
I broke one's teeth.

1061
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:35,457
Did he beat you a lot?

1062
01:37:35,541 --> 01:37:37,457
He beat me with a belt.

1063
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:33,999
Shall we go?

1064
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:50,540
How old are you?

1065
01:38:58,583 --> 01:39:00,207
I'm asking you something.

1066
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,249
How old are you?

1067
01:39:04,333 --> 01:39:05,457
Seventeen.

1068
01:39:06,375 --> 01:39:07,540
Seventeen..

1069
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:10,165
And you still don't use your brain.

1070
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:12,332
When will you start?

1071
01:39:13,041 --> 01:39:15,207
After you turn forty?

1072
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:21,665
Why did you fail?

1073
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,249
I didn't study.

1074
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,457
Why not?

1075
01:39:25,708 --> 01:39:27,582
I don't understand engineering.

1076
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:29,624
You didn't try hard enough.

1077
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:31,582
I did.
- Shut up!

1078
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:34,332
A failure.

1079
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:42,832
If you weren't studying,
what were you doing?

1080
01:39:44,291 --> 01:39:45,457
I'd sit by the river.

1081
01:39:46,833 --> 01:39:53,707
What did you do there?

1082
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:55,374
Smoke cigarettes?

1083
01:39:57,708 --> 01:39:58,874
Yes

1084
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:01,832
When did you start smoking?

1085
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:03,624
In school.

1086
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:07,374
So why did you lie earlier?

1087
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:23,124
Light it.

1088
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:29,499
I'm not joking. Light it.

1089
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,165
Smoke it..

1090
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,957
What other lies have you told me?

1091
01:41:53,458 --> 01:41:55,707
Lying is a weakness.

1092
01:41:57,041 --> 01:41:58,332
It's cowardice.

1093
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:02,999
A liar is a spineless person.

1094
01:42:04,416 --> 01:42:08,040
Who doesn't have the Guts to
say what he really believes.

1095
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,540
You're a coward.

1096
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:14,415
Do you have the Guts
to hear the truth?

1097
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:15,999
I ask the questions here.

1098
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:17,624
I said I want to be a writer.

1099
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:19,165
Did you listen?

1100
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:22,582
You know that l'm a good writer.
Everyone likes my writing..

1101
01:42:22,666 --> 01:42:23,999
I don't.

1102
01:42:24,083 --> 01:42:26,749
And I will not discuss it anymore.

1103
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,249
How often have you lied to me?

1104
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:30,832
Every time you
couldn't digest the truth

1105
01:42:30,916 --> 01:42:33,290
Rohan.
- And where is your spine?

1106
01:42:33,375 --> 01:42:36,582
You lied as well. You said
that Arjun fell down the stairs.

1107
01:42:36,666 --> 01:42:38,290
He didn't fall down the stairs.

1108
01:42:38,583 --> 01:42:40,457
I know that you beat
him with your belt.

1109
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:42,874
I lost a contract
worth a lot because of him.

1110
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:46,165
He should understand
the consequences.

1111
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:47,665
By hitting him?
- It was a mistake.

1112
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:48,915
By sending him to hospital?

1113
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,249
I didn't want to send him to the
hospital. I said it was a mistake.

1114
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:55,082
I didn't want to hit him.
I apologized to him.

1115
01:42:55,166 --> 01:42:58,499
Well done Sir.
Scar the child for life..

1116
01:42:58,583 --> 01:43:01,332
..scare him to death
and then apologise.

1117
01:43:01,583 --> 01:43:03,749
Your father would have been proud.
- Rohan!

1118
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:09,707
I said it happened by mistake,
I didn't want to hit him..

1119
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,332
Did I tell you?

1120
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:13,999
Sir?

1121
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:15,290
What?

1122
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,207
Won't you apologise to me now?

1123
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:18,457
You!

1124
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:37,207
Good morning.

1125
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,374
Good morning, Sir.

1126
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:42,582
Arjun get up.

1127
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:46,040
I know you're awake.

1128
01:44:47,458 --> 01:44:48,707
Get up.

1129
01:44:55,375 --> 01:44:57,290
I'm here to apologize..

1130
01:44:59,083 --> 01:45:00,415
Forgive me.

1131
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:04,499
There's too much work and
then there's the two of you.

1132
01:45:06,166 --> 01:45:07,582
I get frustrated.

1133
01:45:09,041 --> 01:45:11,207
I get angry, and then..

1134
01:45:14,916 --> 01:45:16,457
I thought a lot last night.

1135
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:21,874
I have done a lot for both of you.

1136
01:45:23,458 --> 01:45:26,457
But it was never enough.

1137
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:28,832
And it never will be.

1138
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:34,999
Rohan, you don't want to study

1139
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:38,540
So there's no need
to study any more.

1140
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:43,165
You start work full
time at the factory today.

1141
01:45:44,041 --> 01:45:46,374
You will reach one hour
earlier than the others..

1142
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,540
And you leave two
hours after they leave.

1143
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:52,249
Okay?

1144
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:54,707
Arjun

1145
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:57,207
I have spoken to the principal.

1146
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:00,249
A new semester starts in two weeks.

1147
01:46:01,208 --> 01:46:02,457
You're going to boarding school.

1148
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,999
To study and live there.

1149
01:46:06,583 --> 01:46:07,749
Okay?

1150
01:46:15,083 --> 01:46:18,624
I've decided to
marry again. For myself.

1151
01:46:20,458 --> 01:46:22,040
I get very lonely.

1152
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:26,749
And now that both of you won't
be here, it will get worse..

1153
01:46:28,625 --> 01:46:29,874
Okay?

1154
01:46:38,166 --> 01:46:39,415
Okay.

1155
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:48,332
You're getting married?

1156
01:46:48,791 --> 01:46:49,915
Yes.

1157
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:52,165
To whom?

1158
01:46:52,666 --> 01:46:53,832
Somebody.

1159
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,165
And Rohan? Arjun?

1160
01:46:56,541 --> 01:46:59,332
They're insolent.

1161
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,582
I will always be their enemy.

1162
01:47:01,875 --> 01:47:04,249
But they're your children.

1163
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:06,999
You're sending Arjun to boarding
school? He's six years old..

1164
01:47:07,083 --> 01:47:09,582
I was six when dad sent me..

1165
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:11,957
But Arjun isn't like you.

1166
01:47:12,208 --> 01:47:15,124
Then he'll become like me.
Forget all this..

1167
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,874
You want a drink?

1168
01:47:18,333 --> 01:47:19,457
No.

1169
01:47:24,791 --> 01:47:27,499
Please think about
what you're doing.

1170
01:47:27,666 --> 01:47:29,332
I have thought about it..

1171
01:47:30,166 --> 01:47:31,624
I took this decision
after thinking.

1172
01:47:34,416 --> 01:47:38,165
If it's too much for you
we can take care of Arjun.

1173
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:43,540
What did you say?

1174
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:49,874
What do you mean 'too much'?

1175
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:51,374
I mean..

1176
01:47:51,458 --> 01:47:53,874
What do you mean by 'too much'?

1177
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:57,957
We can bring him up. Take care
of him. Send him to school.

1178
01:47:58,041 --> 01:47:59,915
We have no children..
- Arjun is my son.

1179
01:48:00,458 --> 01:48:02,374
And I'm not in the
business of selling children.

1180
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:03,832
Why take this the wrong way?

1181
01:48:03,916 --> 01:48:06,665
All I'm saying if it's too hard..
- What are you saying?

1182
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:09,374
It isn't my fault that
you didn't have children.

1183
01:48:09,458 --> 01:48:13,040
Adopting Arjun won't cure
your infertility will it?

1184
01:48:13,458 --> 01:48:14,749
That's not fair

1185
01:48:14,833 --> 01:48:15,957
Not fair?

1186
01:48:16,916 --> 01:48:18,124
You want to tell me what's fair?

1187
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:21,665
Get lost..

1188
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:26,915
What is your problem?

1189
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:30,624
Why can't you ever see anyone happy?

1190
01:48:30,708 --> 01:48:31,915
I'm tired.

1191
01:48:32,583 --> 01:48:34,374
I'm tired of making everyone happy.

1192
01:48:34,458 --> 01:48:37,040
First Father, then you.
Now these two. I can't take it.

1193
01:48:37,125 --> 01:48:40,082
Have you ever given him one chance?
- One chance?

1194
01:48:40,666 --> 01:48:43,582
I put everything into his education.
He got kicked out.

1195
01:48:43,666 --> 01:48:46,290
I begged for his admission
into College. He failed.

1196
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:47,540
What else has he ever done?

1197
01:48:47,625 --> 01:48:50,290
He's written a novel.
- He's written nonsense!

1198
01:48:50,708 --> 01:48:52,582
Stop encouraging him.

1199
01:48:52,833 --> 01:48:56,040
Stop living your
unfulfilled dreams through my son.

1200
01:48:57,041 --> 01:48:58,790
I don't want him to
become like you.

1201
01:48:58,875 --> 01:48:59,999
Like me?

1202
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:02,415
Look at yourself..

1203
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:06,332
Big Fat Loser.

1204
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:12,124
What are you looking at? Get out!

1205
01:49:32,291 --> 01:49:33,374
Uncle

1206
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:35,374
Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

1207
01:49:35,458 --> 01:49:37,665
Take me with you.
- No..

1208
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:39,457
Please uncle
- You have to stay here.

1209
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:40,915
Arjun needs you.

1210
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,165
He's going to boarding school.

1211
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:45,332
He'll need you when he gets back.

1212
01:49:45,625 --> 01:49:47,165
You're his only friend.

1213
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:49,374
Please uncle.
- Come on Rohan.

1214
01:49:49,458 --> 01:49:50,915
Don't do this to me right now.

1215
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,707
Please uncle. - Don't do this
to me right now. - Please uncle

1216
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:56,707
Uncle!

1217
01:50:16,291 --> 01:50:18,332
No Papa.. No Papa..

1218
01:50:18,583 --> 01:50:21,665
Papa not that.
Please.. Papa not that. Please

1219
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:24,332
Sir please not that..

1220
01:50:53,000 --> 01:51:03,415
Against the rising waves Your
boat is helpless and tired.

1221
01:51:03,666 --> 01:51:15,624
Living one gasp at a time...
Your boat is helpless and tired.

1222
01:51:15,833 --> 01:51:25,999
Though the currents
are against you...

1223
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:28,624
lt's time to make a difference.

1224
01:51:55,875 --> 01:51:59,624
Hoist the sail with courage...

1225
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:06,624
This is all about your pride.

1226
01:52:07,416 --> 01:52:10,999
Shout ahoy and push ahead.

1227
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:17,624
This is all about your pride.

1228
01:52:18,416 --> 01:52:23,249
Conquer. Raise the victory flag,

1229
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,999
lt's time to do or die.

1230
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:32,582
fly and reach for the sun...

1231
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:41,249
Leave behind the darkness.

1232
01:52:44,833 --> 01:52:46,374
This is my son Rohan.

1233
01:52:46,458 --> 01:52:48,749
Rohan, this is Madhavi.

1234
01:52:48,833 --> 01:52:50,540
Hi Rohan. It's nice to meet you.

1235
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:52,040
Hello.

1236
01:52:52,625 --> 01:52:54,165
And this is her daughter Richa.

1237
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:55,874
Richa, say hello..

1238
01:52:55,958 --> 01:52:57,124
Hello.

1239
01:52:59,833 --> 01:53:01,332
Go wash up.

1240
01:53:01,958 --> 01:53:03,165
Come on.

1241
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:19,957
Powerful storms will shake you...

1242
01:53:21,333 --> 01:53:25,415
lf you surrender to a whirlpool ...

1243
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:32,207
What good is your might?

1244
01:53:32,625 --> 01:53:35,415
Let the light
in your heart overcome

1245
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:37,832
Break away from the night...

1246
01:53:38,083 --> 01:53:43,624
Master the tides...

1247
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:48,749
So that the seas may salute you.

1248
01:53:49,083 --> 01:53:52,374
Happy birthday to you.

1249
01:53:52,458 --> 01:53:54,124
You're 1 8 years old now.

1250
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:57,040
You've become a man, which
is why l'm giving this to you.

1251
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,624
This was my grandfather's watch.

1252
01:54:00,916 --> 01:54:03,207
He gave it to my father
who then gave it to me..

1253
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:06,374
..when I turned 18.

1254
01:54:08,416 --> 01:54:10,332
See that you continue
the tradition.

1255
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:21,124
Living one gasp at a time...

1256
01:54:21,333 --> 01:54:26,082
Your boat is helpless and tired.

1257
01:54:29,916 --> 01:54:32,874
Do you think you're the
Only one who has problems?

1258
01:54:32,958 --> 01:54:35,165
Are we all sitting on
a lotus flower?

1259
01:54:36,166 --> 01:54:40,290
You don't have the Guts to
stand up to your father.

1260
01:54:40,666 --> 01:54:46,165
So just sit here with us,
drink, write and cry like a girl.

1261
01:54:47,125 --> 01:54:51,832
Though the currents
are against you...

1262
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,790
lt's time to make a difference.

1263
01:54:55,041 --> 01:55:01,374
We're having a blast in Bombay.
Remember Vikram's papa's restaurant?

1264
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:04,624
Vikram convinced him to
let him run it for a month.

1265
01:55:04,708 --> 01:55:11,082
Uncle agreed. So Benoy and l
went to help. And guess what?

1266
01:55:11,333 --> 01:55:13,499
Profits doubled in our first month!

1267
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:18,207
Really, it's great. The restaurant
is ours. Uncle retired.

1268
01:55:18,666 --> 01:55:21,707
We work and eat goodies all day.

1269
01:55:22,208 --> 01:55:24,540
Girls are actually talking to us.

1270
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:27,374
Benoy got laid!

1271
01:55:27,458 --> 01:55:30,874
His girlfriend hangs
with us all day..

1272
01:55:31,208 --> 01:55:33,665
If you were here you'd be so happy.

1273
01:55:33,958 --> 01:55:35,874
Come to Bombay.

1274
01:55:36,375 --> 01:55:37,499
Hello.

1275
01:55:38,583 --> 01:55:39,749
Rohan?

1276
01:55:40,083 --> 01:55:41,749
Rohan, are you there?

1277
01:55:41,958 --> 01:55:45,749
Listen, I have to go,
I'll call later.

1278
01:55:45,833 --> 01:55:49,332
Wait, talk to Benoy and Vikram..

1279
01:55:49,875 --> 01:55:52,207
ROHAN!!!!

1280
01:58:12,666 --> 01:58:14,374
He was so drunk

1281
01:58:14,583 --> 01:58:16,540
That he couldn't
even stand straight.

1282
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:18,957
The car?

1283
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:21,707
Buy a new one.

1284
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:23,624
Where?

1285
01:58:27,666 --> 01:58:29,582
Not him. The car.

1286
02:00:03,708 --> 02:00:04,832
When do you leave
for boarding school?

1287
02:00:05,583 --> 02:00:06,665
Tomorrow.

1288
02:00:07,208 --> 02:00:08,332
Good Luck.

1289
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:10,582
Where are you going?

1290
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:12,832
I'm leaving home.

1291
02:01:14,833 --> 02:01:15,915
Why?

1292
02:01:16,666 --> 02:01:17,915
Are you unhappy with my marriage?

1293
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,499
No. Not at all.

1294
02:01:19,916 --> 02:01:21,332
I'm delighted.

1295
02:01:22,041 --> 02:01:23,499
Your frustrations will
come out somewhere else.

1296
02:01:24,125 --> 02:01:25,874
And Arjun won't need to
go to the hospital again.

1297
02:01:28,458 --> 02:01:29,749
Excuse me.

1298
02:01:33,041 --> 02:01:36,124
Rohan.

1299
02:01:57,541 --> 02:01:59,124
You fucker..

1300
02:04:34,875 --> 02:04:36,290
I'm going to Bombay.

1301
02:04:40,333 --> 02:04:41,582
What will you do there?

1302
02:04:43,541 --> 02:04:45,290
I'll work in Vikram's restaurant.

1303
02:04:47,541 --> 02:04:48,707
I'll write.

1304
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:50,999
I'll clean toilets.

1305
02:04:51,458 --> 02:04:52,957
But I won't ever come back.

1306
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:26,332
Though our feet be chained,
Dreams will ever float free.

1307
02:10:27,583 --> 02:10:31,457
Even tender sprouts break
through the mighty earth.

1308
02:10:31,791 --> 02:10:36,624
Hopeful hearts can hold no fear..

1309
02:10:37,166 --> 02:10:46,749
When they listen to
their inner voice.

1310
02:10:49,291 --> 02:10:50,499
Hi.

1311
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:55,207
Sir's gone to get an autorickshaw.

1312
02:10:55,291 --> 02:10:56,415
Let him go.

1313
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:58,040
You're coming with me.

1314
02:10:58,666 --> 02:11:00,290
Sir asked me to wait here.

1315
02:11:00,416 --> 02:11:02,040
Forget what Sir said.

1316
02:11:02,541 --> 02:11:05,290
Do you want to go
to boarding school?

1317
02:11:06,041 --> 02:11:08,207
You will come with me
wherever l go.

1318
02:11:12,625 --> 02:11:13,999
I'll be back in a moment.

1319
02:11:22,833 --> 02:11:27,582
How do you cage the morning rays?

1320
02:11:27,666 --> 02:11:32,457
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1321
02:11:32,666 --> 02:11:37,332
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1322
02:11:37,583 --> 02:11:42,040
They soar high up in the sky.

1323
02:11:42,125 --> 02:11:46,999
How do you cage the morning rays?

1324
02:11:47,083 --> 02:11:51,874
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1325
02:11:53,250 --> 02:11:54,582
Ready?

1326
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:56,707
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1327
02:11:56,791 --> 02:12:01,207
They soar high up in the sky.

1328
02:12:20,708 --> 02:12:29,749
Freedom..

1329
02:12:29,833 --> 02:12:33,082
Can never be asked for.

1330
02:12:39,875 --> 02:12:48,499
Freedom..

1331
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:58,915
Seize it and live forever free.

1332
02:13:03,958 --> 02:13:08,624
How do you cage someone's thoughts?

1333
02:13:08,708 --> 02:13:13,332
Just as soon as birds grow wings,

1334
02:13:13,416 --> 02:13:18,124
They soar high up in the sky.

1335
02:13:19,083 --> 02:13:20,999
I'm taking Arjun with me.

1336
02:13:21,333 --> 02:13:23,207
If l leave him here he will become

1337
02:13:23,625 --> 02:13:25,415
..another version of you.

1338
02:13:25,666 --> 02:13:29,707
One of you is enough for this world.

1339
02:13:30,250 --> 02:13:34,957
You will never
understand why this happened.

1340
02:13:35,458 --> 02:13:42,124
Because it's a word you've
never known or experienced..

1341
02:13:42,791 --> 02:13:43,999
Love.

1342
02:13:45,041 --> 02:13:47,249
Please don't try to find us.

1343
02:13:47,333 --> 02:13:49,207
If you come within
a 1 00 kilometers of us,

1344
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:52,582
The police will know you beat Arjun.

1345
02:13:52,833 --> 02:13:56,207
Legally, it's a criminal offence.

1346
02:13:57,208 --> 02:14:00,249
Arjun can be a lot
more than just your slave.

1347
02:14:00,625 --> 02:14:03,165
He needs a family, not a cage.

1348
02:14:03,625 --> 02:14:07,749
He needs a future, which I will make
sure he gets, whatever the cost..

1349
02:14:08,375 --> 02:14:12,749
Congratulations on your new wife,
your new daughter, your new life.

1350
02:14:13,250 --> 02:14:15,457
Your son, Rohan.

1351
02:14:16,250 --> 02:14:25,749
Is life over?
Or is it about to begin?

1352
02:14:26,166 --> 02:14:34,832
Is this nightfall?
Or is it a new dawn?

1353
02:14:35,375 --> 02:14:42,499
Will the future bring comfort?

1354
02:14:44,666 --> 02:14:52,124
Or will bring us to a crossroad?

1355
02:14:53,500 --> 02:15:02,124
Who knows what lies ahead..
