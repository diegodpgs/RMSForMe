1
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,190
Went through the crack...

2
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,550
Our twelfth edition of
the Psychic Friends Network...

3
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,510
Shea Stadium...

4
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,790
You're watching TV Time...

5
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,470
the only network
playing lots of old stuff...

6
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,630
in nothing but black and white.

7
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,790
Why, it's fun
for the whole family!

8
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,750
TV Time...
remember, you're soaking in it.

9
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,230
This Friday on TV Time...

10
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,310
Take the phone off the hook
and the plastic off the couch.

11
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,150
That's right,
it's the Pleasantville marathon!

12
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,830
24 hours chocked full
of pure family values.

13
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,270
Featuring the warm greeting...

14
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,790
Honey, I'm home.

15
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,150
Proper nutrition...

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,190
Do you want some more cookies?

17
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,190
And, of course, safe sex.

18
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,030
Why, it's a scrapbook...

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,150
of all your favorite
Pleasantville memories.

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,910
There's
"Trouble At The Barbershop..."

21
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,870
"Fireman For a Day..."

22
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,990
"The Big Game..."

23
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,550
And who could forget
"Bud Gets a Job"?

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,990
So join all your favorites...

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,710
Mary Sue, Bud, George,
and Betty...

26
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,710
and oh, yes, Mr. Johnson
at the soda shop.

27
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,910
But wait, there's more!

28
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,550
If you put
your thinking caps on...

29
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,470
you could win $1,000 in our
Pleasantville trivia contest...

30
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,350
plus a free trip to the
Pleasantville of your choice.

31
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,110
Flash-back
to kinder, gentler times...

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,750
on the Pleasantville marathon...

33
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,990
this Friday only on...

34
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,310
I mean, hi.

35
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,710
Look,
you probably don't think...

36
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,830
I should be asking you this.

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,750
I mean,
not knowing you well and all.

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,870
L... I mean, I know you.
Everybody knows you.

39
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,430
I just don't know you...
technically.

40
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,470
Anyhow...

41
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,630
I don't know what you're doing
this weekend...

42
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,030
but my mom's leaving town...

43
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,430
and she's letting me borrow
the car, so, you know...

44
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,190
Okey-dokey,
so just give me a call.

45
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,350
Let me know.

46
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,790
Bye.

47
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,910
For those of you going on
to college next year...

48
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,710
the chance of finding
a good job...

49
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,310
will actually decrease
by the time you graduate.

50
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,030
The available number
of entry-level jobs...

51
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,750
will drop 31%/%
over the next four years.

52
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,430
Median income for those jobs
will go down as well.

53
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,510
Obviously, my friends,
it's a competitive world...

54
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,710
and good grades
are your only ticket through.

55
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,230
In fact, by the year 2000...

56
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,350
...chance of contracting HIV
from a non-monogamous life...

57
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,870
will climb to 1 in 150.

58
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,070
The odds of dying in an auto
accident are only 1 in 2500.

59
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,750
Now,
this marks a drastic increase...

60
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,150
...from 14 years ago
when ozone depletion...

61
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,910
was at just 10%/%
of its current level.

62
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,070
By the time
you are 30 years old...

63
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,910
average global temperature
will have risen 21/2 degrees...

64
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,030
causing such
catastrophic consequences...

65
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,470
as typhoons, floods,
widespread drought, and famine.

66
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,630
OK, who can tell me
what famine is?

67
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,670
Honey, I'm home.

68
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,710
Hello, darling.
How was your day?

69
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,150
Oh, swell.
You know, Mr. Connell says...

70
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,230
if things keep going
the way they are...

71
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,630
I might be seeing that promotion
sooner than I thought.

72
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,990
Oh, darling, that's wonderful.

73
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,270
I always knew you could do it.

74
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,110
Hey, pumpkin, what's that smell?
Is that your meat loaf?

75
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,470
It might be.

76
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,790
It might be.

77
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,190
Oh, pumpkin,
you sure know the way...

78
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,470
to this man's heart.

79
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,750
No, that was not the deal.

80
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,910
No, you have custody
first weekend of every month.

81
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,270
This is the first weekend.

82
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,830
No. I'm not gonna bail you out.

83
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,430
I'm going out of town
this weekend.

84
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,750
La Costa.

85
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,270
Barry, if I want to have a mud
bath with my new boyfriend...

86
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,950
that's my business, isn't it?

87
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,230
Hey, where are those kids?

88
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,030
Right behind you, Father.

89
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,350
Right behind you, Father.

90
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,750
Mother, Father, Bud has
a little surprise for you.

91
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,990
What's that, Bud?

92
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,630
First place in the science fair.

93
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,750
There were
lots of swell projects.

94
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,670
I guess
mine was just the swellest.

95
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,150
Darling, that's wonderful...

96
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,310
except there's
no such word as "swellest."

97
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,150
Well, gee whiz, Mom,
it wasn't the English fair.

98
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,550
[Laughter]

99
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,190
No, that's not the point.

100
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,750
The point is,
you're supposed to see them.

101
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,190
Fine. See them another time.

102
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,790
What's a mother to do?

103
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,950
What's a mother to do?

104
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,710
OK, in the very first
Pleasantville episode...

105
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,350
whose window did Bud break...

106
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,270
when he was playing
with his father's golf clubs?

107
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,710
Easy. Mr. Jenkins.

108
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,110
What job did Mr. Jenkins have?

109
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,310
Salesman.

110
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,310
What did they name the cat
they found in the gutter?

111
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,710
Scout?

112
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,950
Marmalade.

113
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,510
All right, all right.

114
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,350
Here's one.

115
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,310
Why did their parents
come home early...

116
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,190
from their weekend at the lake?

117
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,670
'Cause Bud didn't
answer the phone...

118
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,430
and they were worried about him.

119
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,670
Man... you're unbelievable.

120
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,550
You'll win this thing for sure.
When is it on?

121
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,950
Marathon starts at 6:30,
contest is tomorrow at noon.

122
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,030
Thousand bucks, huh?
And it's on all night?

123
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,230
Of course. That's why
they call it a marathon.

124
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,590
Oh, my God, he is so pathetic.

125
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,550
I can't believe
you're related to him.

126
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,910
Only on my parents' side.

127
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,150
Yeah, but you guys
are twins and stuff.

128
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,230
You must be from
the cool side of the uterus.

129
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,550
Oh, my God, here they come.

130
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,470
Oh, my God,
just don't do anything.

131
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,630
What?

132
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,910
Saw you at the mall yesterday.

133
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,150
Yeah, I saw you, too.

134
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,070
So, you gonna watch
the concert on MTV tonight?

135
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,150
Yeah. You?

136
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,910
My mom's gonna be out of town.

137
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,670
- Cool.
- Cool.

138
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,510
It was so amazing, Daph.

139
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,030
I was, like,
"My mom's gonna go out of town."

140
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,470
And he was like,
"Well, maybe we could..."

141
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,350
And I was, "Yeah, sure."
And he was, "Cool."

142
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,950
I know. He's so smart.

143
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,910
I'm thinking about that
red thing I got at the mall.

144
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,230
It's not slutty.

145
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,190
It's fun.

146
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,630
Well, hello,
he's not coming over to study.

147
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,110
Yeah, I know.

148
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,950
Well, sometimes
I'm jealous of you, too.

149
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,230
He's not homeless, Howard.
They don't say where he lives.

150
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,830
Well, it's a silly question.

151
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,750
Because nobody's homeless
in Pleasantville.

152
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,630
'Cause that's
just not what it's like.

153
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,310
Look, Howard, it's almost 6:30.

154
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,190
I gotta go.

155
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,470
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

156
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,030
Cut it out, David. Mark Davis
is gonna be here in minutes.

157
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,910
Great. The Pleasantville
marathon starts at 6:30.

158
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,750
I don't believe this!
He's gonna be here!

159
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,550
You can watch it upstairs.

160
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,750
Upstairs?!

161
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,750
It doesn't have any stereo!

162
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,950
Oh, my God.

163
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,510
Oh, my God!

164
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,590
David, stop stressing.
You can turn it on normally.

165
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,630
No, I can't. It's a new TV, Jen.

166
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,150
It doesn't work
without a remote.

167
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,670
Oh, my God, he's here!

168
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,350
TV repair.

169
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,710
TV repair?

170
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,110
Yeah. TV busted?

171
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,710
Well, here I am.

172
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,750
Holy cow, look at that.

173
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,630
Had a little disaster,
didn't you, fella?

174
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,950
Well, yeah, sort of.

175
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,190
Well, we'll get you fixed up
in no time.

176
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,150
I know how
I'd feel if mine went out.

177
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,750
Almost like losing a friend.

178
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,190
You know,
we didn't call any TV repair.

179
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,230
That makes it a lucky day
for both of us, doesn't it?

180
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,150
Do you think
you could do this soon?

181
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,350
- It's almost 6:30.
- What's the hurry?

182
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,870
Pleasantville marathon
starts at 6:30.

183
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,270
Pleasantville?
Gosh, I love that show.

184
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,670
Watched it for years.

185
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,430
That's not the reason.
I've got a date at 6:30.

186
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,870
Who did Muffin take
to the masquerade ball...

187
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,750
when her date came down
with the measles?

188
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,830
- Her father.
- That's right.

189
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,670
- And how'd she dress him?
- As Prince Charming.

190
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,030
Nice. Remember the one
where Bud lost his cousin...

191
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,230
when he was supposed
to be watching him?

192
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,950
What department store
did they go to?

193
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,350
- McIntyre’s.
- McGinty's.

194
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,070
No. McIntyre’s. Remember?

195
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,670
For the very best
in men's attire

196
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,630
Head right down to McIntyre’s

197
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,070
That's right.

198
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,110
Listen...

199
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,750
Why don't you take
this remote instead?

200
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,430
It's got a little more
oomph in it.

201
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,870
Oomph?

202
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,870
Sure.
Big beautiful set like that?

203
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,750
You want something that'll
put you right in the show.

204
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,750
It's great. We'll take it.

205
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,990
Thank you.

206
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,750
Well, I better get going.

207
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,150
Your show's almost on...

208
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,750
and it's almost time
for your date.

209
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,870
Take care now.

210
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,590
Whether it's on the track
at Indy...

211
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,670
or driving around the block,
only new Pennzoil...

212
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,270
For program information...

213
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,710
Honey, I'm home.

214
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,830
Great.

215
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,830
Let me see that.

216
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,230
No way.

217
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,630
Gee whiz, Mary Sue,
why can't I borrow your radio?

218
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,510
I promised Betty Jean
she could use it.

219
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,630
Do you mind?

220
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,790
This is only the most important
moment of my life!

221
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,750
Forget it, Jen!
I've waited a year for this!

222
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,390
Come on, David,
just give it to me!

223
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,710
- Forget it!
- No way, Bud!

224
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,470
Forget it, Mary Sue!

225
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,590
Come on, Bud!
It's mine! Give it back!

226
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,350
Oh, my God.

227
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,870
- What happened?
- I'm not sure.

228
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,150
Hi, Sport. Hi, Muffin.

229
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,630
Better get a move on.
You'll be late for school.

230
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,430
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

231
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,750
Look at me! I'm pasty!

232
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,470
Over here!

233
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,630
Told you it was your lucky day.

234
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,870
I bet you thought
I was just a fan or something.

235
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,310
What happened?

236
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,910
A miracle. Every time
I thought I'd found someone...

237
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,830
they'd turn out
to disappoint me.

238
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,870
They'd know the early episodes,
but not the later ones.

239
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,230
They'd know all about Muffin,
but not about Bud.

240
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,630
What the hell is going on?

241
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,910
Can't talk like that here.

242
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,990
You're in... Well, you know.

243
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,990
Bud, Mary Sue,
breakfast is on the table.

244
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,110
We're in Pleasantville?

245
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,110
A dream come true, huh?

246
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,790
Listen, this really isn't funny.

247
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,270
I have a very important date
in five minutes!

248
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,350
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

249
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,390
Bitch.

250
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,150
You have got to get us
out of here!

251
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,350
- Why would I do that?
- Because we don't belong!

252
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,870
Sure you do.
McIntyre’s department store...

253
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,790
their father dressed
as Prince Charming.

254
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,510
That was gorgeous, Bud.

255
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,310
- My name is David!
- Oh, God!

256
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,070
This is a strange way of
showing your appreciation.

257
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,990
Hey, we appreciate it.
We really do.

258
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,870
We just want to go home now.

259
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,150
But you don't know how long I've
looked for someone like you.

260
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,390
I'm very disappointed.

261
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,710
In fact, I'm starting
to get a little upset.

262
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,270
No, don't get upset.

263
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,150
Well, wouldn't you?
You look for someone for years.

264
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,470
You pour your heart into it...

265
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,910
This is a privilege, you know!

266
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,390
I don't think I'd better
talk about this now.

267
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,830
Where are you going?

268
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,150
I don't think we should discuss
this until I'm composed.

269
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,550
Wait a minute!

270
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,950
Maybe in a while
when I'm not so emotional!

271
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,550
Give you a week or two
to change your attitude!

272
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,550
Come back!

273
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,830
Come back!

274
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,510
A week or two?

275
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,830
Oh, God.

276
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,030
What's gonna happen?

277
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,710
I don't know. It's not possible.
Is it possible?

278
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,950
Bud, Mary Sue,
your breakfast is getting cold.

279
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,630
It can't be possible.

280
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,910
Well, come on, kids.

281
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,150
You're not going to school
without breakfast inside you.

282
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,870
Forward march.

283
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,550
I just love you in that sweater,
Mary Sue.

284
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,790
It's so flattering.

285
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,350
Thanks.

286
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,270
Morning, kids.

287
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,670
Better get a move on,
or you'll be late for school.

288
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,350
I don't believe this.

289
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,750
Neither do I.

290
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,910
Well, come on, dig in.

291
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,470
I put blueberries in them
just the way you like.

292
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,110
Well, come on, sweetie,
it's getting late.

293
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,710
Actually, I'm not hungry.

294
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,110
Nonsense, young lady.

295
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,830
You're gonna start your day off
with a nice, big breakfast.

296
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,870
Here we go. Sit down.

297
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,470
Here's some pancakes and eggs.

298
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,670
Sausage and
some good crisp bacon.

299
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,870
And, of course, a ham steak.

300
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,830
You eat on up,
then it's off to school.

301
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,950
Hurry, hurry.

302
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,470
I'm gonna hurl, David,
I swear to God.

303
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,150
Just take deep breaths.

304
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,790
It's all that animal fat.
I can feel it in my pores.

305
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,790
I still don't see why
we're doing this.

306
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,350
Because we're supposed
to be in school.

307
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,310
We're supposed to be at home.

308
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,230
We're supposed to be in color!

309
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,350
Oh, God!

310
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,950
Hello, Bud.

311
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,830
Hello, Mr. Simpson.

312
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,590
Hear your dad's got a new car.

313
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,950
Oh, yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

314
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,910
Great.

315
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,310
Do you know that guy?

316
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,270
Yeah.
He owns the hardware store.

317
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,350
You listen to me
for just a minute!

318
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,350
I don't know what you've done,
but you better fix it!

319
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,750
I had a date with Mark Davis,
and I even bought new underwear!

320
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,630
We have to play along
until that guy shows up again.

321
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,070
Play along?

322
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,030
Yes! I am Bud Parker,
and you are Mary Sue.

323
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,750
No. I'm not gonna do it.

324
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,670
If I don't dress like this
for Mom...

325
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,950
I'm sure not gonna
do it for you!

326
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,870
We have no choice, Jen.

327
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,590
We are stuck here
until that guy shows up again.

328
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,430
Why can't we just explain it
to somebody?

329
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,030
To who?

330
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,790
Go! Go! Go!

331
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,190
Here, kitty.

332
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,790
Oh, God.

333
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,270
We are.

334
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,710
We're stuck in Nerdville.

335
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,990
I knew you'd pay a price
for this.

336
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,550
I knew you couldn't be
so hopelessly geek-ridden...

337
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,110
for so long without suffering
some really tragic consequences.

338
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,030
But it's just not fair.

339
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,190
I was getting really popular.

340
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,030
Debbie Russell transferred
to another school...

341
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,430
and my skin was really great
since March.

342
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,750
Mark Davis was finally starting
to come around.

343
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,910
Hello, Mary Sue.

344
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,910
What's all the commotion?
Where's the cat?

345
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,630
It's...

346
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,550
Right.

347
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,790
I'll see you at school,
Mary Sue.

348
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,550
Who's that?

349
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,750
Skip Martin,
captain of the basketball team.

350
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,630
Does he like me?

351
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,350
As a matter of fact, he does.

352
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,070
Those are my friends?

353
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,990
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne,
Betty Jean.

354
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,350
Can we do any better?

355
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,790
I don't think so.

356
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,670
Last week, class, we discussed
the geography of Main Street.

357
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,830
This week we're going to be
talking about Elm Street.

358
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,670
Now, can anyone tell me
the difference...

359
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,390
between Elm Street
and Main Street?

360
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,510
Tommy.

361
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,510
It's not as long?

362
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,950
That's right, Tommy.
It's not as long.

363
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,630
Also, it only has houses...

364
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,710
so the geography of Main Street
is different...

365
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,150
than the geography
of Elm Street.

366
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,190
Yeah. What's outside
of Pleasantville?

367
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,430
I don't understand.

368
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,910
Outside of Pleasantville.

369
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,470
What's at
the end of Main Street?

370
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,510
Mary Sue, you should know
the answer to that.

371
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,950
The end of Main Street
is just the beginning again.

372
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,590
Come on, men, let's go!

373
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,670
That's it, men, keep it up.
Big game tomorrow.

374
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,230
Hiya, Bud.

375
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,190
Hiya, Skip.

376
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,550
Hiya, Bud.

377
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,790
Hiya, Skip.

378
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,870
Bud, can I ask you a question?

379
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,310
Sure.

380
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,990
Well...

381
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,350
If I was
to go up to your sister...

382
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,310
What I mean is,
if I was to go up to Mary Sue...

383
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,270
Oh, my God.
Are we in that episode?

384
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,830
- What?
- I don't believe this.

385
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:39,990
What's the matter?

386
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,510
You want to ask her out tonight
and give her your school pin.

387
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,990
Yeah. How'd you know?

388
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,390
Look, Skip, I don't think...

389
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,510
it's a real good time for that
right now.

390
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,670
What do you mean?

391
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,790
Well, what I mean is...

392
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,790
Mary Sue's
a little different lately.

393
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,350
She won't go out with me?

394
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,310
No, hey, I didn't say that.

395
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,710
I don't know what I'd do
if she wouldn't go out with me.

396
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,190
Come here, guys.
Don't touch it. Stay back.

397
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,630
I'm sure
we'll work something out.

398
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,710
- I thought you liked him.
- Yeah, but I don't know.

399
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,830
One date, Jen.
That's all I'm asking.

400
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,590
If you don't go out
with this guy...

401
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,350
we could throw their whole
universe out of whack.

402
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,830
It's too weird, David.
This place gives me the creeps.

403
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,150
Did you know
the books are blank?

404
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,230
- What?
- I went in the library.

405
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,670
They have covers
and nothing inside of them.

406
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,430
What were you
doing in a library?

407
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,310
I got lost.
Oh, wait, look at this.

408
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,710
Know why the firemen
only rescue cats out of trees?

409
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,110
- Nothing burns around here.
- Jen, stop!

410
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,670
They don't even need firemen!
I could really use a cigarette!

411
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,070
Jen, listen.
I will get us out of here.

412
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,390
I really will,
but if we don't play along...

413
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,710
we can alter
their whole existence...

414
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,630
and then we may never get home.

415
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,110
You really think
anybody's gonna notice...

416
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,470
if I don't have
a chocolate malt with this guy?

417
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,110
You won't believe
what we just heard!

418
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,710
- Skip's gonna ask you out!
- That's not all!

419
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,430
He's gonna give you his pin!

420
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,270
Are you sure
I'm supposed to wear this?

421
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,990
I could kill a guy
with these things.

422
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,470
It's in your closet.

423
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,430
I've worn kinky stuff before...

424
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,310
- He won't notice anyway.
- Why not?

425
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,310
They just don't notice
that kind of thing around here.

426
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,230
- So what's the point?
- Jen, please.

427
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,630
Hello. I've got three pounds
of underwear on here.

428
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,630
Just go with the program.
I'm late for work.

429
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,870
Work?

430
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,790
Yeah, sorry.
I just had to help my folks...

431
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,630
and then I couldn't find my hat.

432
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,150
I didn't know what to do.

433
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,030
What's wrong?

434
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,910
Well, I always
wipe down the counter...

435
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,470
and then you set out
the napkins and glasses...

436
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,110
and then I make
the French fries.

437
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,950
But you didn't come
so I just kept on wiping.

438
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,910
I'm sorry.

439
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,590
You know,
if this ever happens again...

440
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,350
You can make the fries...

441
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,390
even if I haven't put out
the napkins yet.

442
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,590
Thank you.

443
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,670
There aren't any cheeseburgers.

444
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,710
What?

445
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,830
Usually, I put out the burger
and you finish with the lettuce.

446
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,710
OK, listen.
Do you have the lettuce?

447
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,310
Have you cooked the burgers?

448
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,910
Put on the lettuce,
finish the burger...

449
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,910
and pretend it was me doing it
the whole time.

450
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,070
You can do it, really.

451
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,590
I sure am glad you said
you'd come out with me tonight.

452
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,030
Well, gee whiz, Skip.
I sure am glad you asked me.

453
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,590
I don't know if I ever said this
to you before...

454
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,110
but I think you're just
about the keenest girl...

455
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,270
in the whole school.

456
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,710
Really, Skip? The keenest?

457
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,550
Oh, yeah.

458
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,070
What can I get you two?

459
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,150
I don't know, Bud.

460
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,950
I guess I'll have my usual
cheeseburger and a cherry Coke.

461
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,710
I don't know, Bud.
I'll have a salad and an Evian.

462
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,910
Cheeseburger it is.

463
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,870
You see?

464
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,550
The whole time we were in Civics
together...

465
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,110
I really wanted to come over
and sit next to you...

466
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,870
but you were always sat between
Lisa Anne and Peggy Jane.

467
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:50,110
And you always seemed
so smart and everything.

468
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,190
Like that report you did
on our town hall.

469
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,470
Gosh. I didn't know
what I'd talk to you about.

470
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,990
Yeah. Well, sometimes
talking's overrated.

471
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,350
Don't you think?

472
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,630
Oh, right.

473
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,750
So I know I haven't been steady
with anybody or anything...

474
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,110
but I just don't want
to rush it.

475
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,590
There's kids that are even
holding hands already...

476
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,390
but I figure there's plenty
of time for that later on.

477
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,790
Can you excuse me
for just a second?

478
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,270
Oh, God.

479
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,790
Oh, God.

480
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,830
- Did he give it to you?
- I bet he did.

481
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,390
I don't think he knows how.

482
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,270
I bet he's gonna take her
to Lovers Lane.

483
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,950
I bet he is.

484
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,350
I bet
he's even gonna hold her hand.

485
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,110
So, anyhow, I really wanted
to sit next to you in Civics...

486
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,430
- You want to get out of here?
- What?

487
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,190
Do you want to go somewhere?

488
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,510
But where could we go?

489
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,190
Lovers Lane.

490
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,470
Lovers Lane?

491
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,350
Yeah, Lover's Lane.
You up for it?

492
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,830
Come on.

493
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,310
Come on.

494
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,310
Oh, shit.

495
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,230
Jennifer!

496
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,790
Jennifer, stop!

497
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,590
Stop!

498
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,390
You can't do this, Jennifer!
He doesn't exist!

499
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,630
You can't do this to someone
who doesn't exist!

500
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,190
It sure is pretty.

501
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,110
Oh, yeah. Gorgeous.

502
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,670
To be honest, Mary Sue,
I didn't think you'd want...

503
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,230
to come here until we'd been
pinned for a little while.

504
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,870
Oh, Skip, you can pin me
anytime you want to.

505
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,550
Or maybe I should just pin you.

506
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,190
That's silly, Mary Sue.

507
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,070
How could you possibly pin me?

508
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,230
Son, what's wrong?

509
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,390
Have you seen Mary Sue?

510
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,750
No. She's still out with Skip.
Is something the matter?

511
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,510
No.
I was just worried about her.

512
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,070
Bud, your sister's
getting older now.

513
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,630
She'll naturally
be going out with boys.

514
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,630
But she's a fine young woman.

515
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,630
She would never do anything
for us to be concerned about.

516
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,550
Honest.

517
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,710
I think I better go home now,
Mary Sue.

518
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,110
Why?

519
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,950
I think I might be ill.

520
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,150
Something's happening to me.

521
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,910
That's supposed to happen.

522
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,870
It is?

523
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,270
Yeah. Trust me.

524
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,510
Do you want some more cookies?

525
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,510
No, thanks. I'm fine.

526
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,670
How about
some marshmallow rice squares?

527
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,070
Those are swell.

528
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,750
No, I'm fine, thank you.

529
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,790
- Who could that be?
- I've got it.

530
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,710
Hi. You took off so quick
I wasn't sure you were OK.

531
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,150
No, I'm fine.
I just had to get home early.

532
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,430
You know how when we close up...

533
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,070
I close the register,
then you lower the blinds...

534
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,150
and I turn out the lights,
and we both lock the doors?

535
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:27,910
Well, you weren't around
this time...

536
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,990
so I did the whole thing
by myself.

537
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,070
Wow.

538
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,150
And I didn't even do it
in the same order.

539
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,710
First I lowered the blinds,
then I closed the register.

540
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,950
Hello, Betty.

541
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,950
Hello, Bill.

542
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,750
OK, well, that's great.
Thank you for stopping by.

543
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,070
I appreciate it.

544
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,710
I'll see you tomorrow.

545
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,510
Well, gee, thanks, Skip.
I sure had a wonderful time.

546
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,110
Me, too.

547
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,030
Night.

548
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,470
Hello, Mr. Johnson.

549
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,070
Oh, hello, Mary Sue.

550
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,190
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

551
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,390
What do you mean, "nothing"?
That's not nothing.

552
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,710
Why don't you relax, Bud?
We had a nice time.

553
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,710
I am really sleepy,
and I have to wake up...

554
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,430
early in the morning
to go to school. Night.

555
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,190
Hi. Looks like it's gonna be
another beautiful sunny day.

556
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,350
High 72, low 72,
not a cloud in the sky.

557
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:46,030
It's 8:00 in the morning.
Are you watching television?

558
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,470
Oh, no.

559
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,190
Come on, men.
Let's get in positions.

560
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,030
We got a big game next week.
Let's go.

561
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,230
Come on.

562
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,030
Oh, my God.

563
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,310
You can't do this, Jennifer.
I warned you.

564
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,870
So what's the big deal?

565
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,830
OK. They're not good
at basketball anymore.

566
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,990
Oh, my God. What a tragedy.

567
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,110
You don't understand.

568
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,350
You're messing with
their whole goddamn universe.

569
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,310
Maybe it needs
to be messed with, David.

570
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,710
Did that ever occur to you?

571
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,270
Hey, M.S., how you doing?

572
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,950
Cool, P.J., how you doing?

573
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,270
Cool. Cool.

574
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,390
Cool.

575
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,910
"Cool"? What are you
doing to these people?

576
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,670
- Lf I don't, who will?
- But they're happy.

577
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,830
Nobody is happy in a
poodle skirt and a sweater set.

578
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,190
You really like this, don't you?

579
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,870
No, it's not like
you think it's funny or dorky.

580
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,950
You really like it.

581
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,430
No. You have it all wrong.

582
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,030
I am personally mortified
to be your sister.

583
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,990
You have no right
to do this to them.

584
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,710
David, listen to me
for just a minute.

585
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,790
They don't want to be geeks.
They want to be attractive.

586
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,030
They have a lot of potential.
They just don't know any better.

587
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,630
They don't have
that kind of potential.

588
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,870
Oh, yeah? Look at that.

589
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,990
Wow. What happened to your gum?

590
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,070
I gotta go.

591
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,710
I'm gonna meet Skip
at the flagpole.

592
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,990
Well, I don't think
it's anything to worry about.

593
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,390
You cut down on greasy
foods and chocolate.

594
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,430
You know, things like that.

595
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,110
It'll probably just clear up
on its own.

596
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,270
Jesus Christ.

597
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,630
Do you think we could have
two cheeseburgers...

598
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,270
and some cherry Cokes?

599
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,350
I'll be right with you.

600
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,870
Thanks.

601
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,510
Two cheeseburgers,
two cherry Cokes.

602
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,830
There aren't any cheeseburgers.

603
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,350
I thought
we talked about this.

604
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,830
What's the point, Bud?

605
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,790
You make hamburgers.
That is the point.

606
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,710
No. I know I do.

607
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,350
It's always the same, you know?

608
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,950
Grill the bun, flip the meat,
melt the cheese.

609
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,830
It never changes.
It never gets better or worse.

610
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,710
OK, just listen for a second.

611
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,630
The other night when I closed
by myself, that was different.

612
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,670
Forget about that!

613
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,790
I really liked it, though.

614
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,670
Come here.

615
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,470
Look.

616
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,310
You can't always
like what you do.

617
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,350
Sometimes you just gotta do it
because it's your job.

618
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,310
And even if you don't like it,
you just gotta do it anyway.

619
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,590
Why?

620
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,990
So they can have
their hamburgers!

621
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,750
I'm sorry.

622
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,110
You know what I really like?

623
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,150
- What's that?
- Christmas time.

624
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,750
See, every year on December 3...

625
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,430
I get to paint the Christmas
decorations in the window...

626
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,990
and every year I get to paint
a different thing.

627
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,430
Here, I'll show you.

628
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,350
Wow. That's pretty good.

629
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,190
Thanks, but this morning
I was thinking...

630
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,150
and I realized that I look
forward to it all year.

631
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,230
And then I thought,
"Gee, that seems awfully silly.

632
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,270
"It seems like a long time
to wait for just one moment."

633
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,630
Don't you think?

634
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,830
Well, don't you?

635
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:59,230
I think that you should try not
to think about that anymore.

636
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,590
I'll try that, then.

637
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,710
- Morning, Jim.
- How are you, Bill?

638
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,150
Have they ever lost before?

639
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,310
Basketball?
No, they sure haven't.

640
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,790
It just feels wrong, that's all.

641
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,870
Maybe that's where
they get that saying...

642
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,630
"You can't win 'em all."

643
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,030
That's a good point, Ralph.
They do have that saying.

644
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,510
But they do win 'em all.
They've always won 'em all.

645
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,110
Mr. Mayor, here. Go ahead.

646
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,950
Don't be silly, Roy. I couldn't
possibly take your spot.

647
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,030
What I want to know is,
if they've never lost before...

648
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,670
and they've never tied before,
isn't that winning 'em all?

649
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,790
He's right.
That's what you call it.

650
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,150
Yeah, that's true.

651
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,430
He said it would clear up
on its own...

652
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,270
if she just stayed away
from fried foods and sweets.

653
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:59,190
Except it's spread
to her lips now, too.

654
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,670
Oh, I don't know.

655
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,790
And you say it was just red?

656
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,550
Well, you know, like real red.

657
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,230
I know what you mean.

658
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,030
That's like this car
that was in front...

659
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,870
of Bill Johnson's soda shop.

660
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,950
I was going by it
and it looked green.

661
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,990
Real green.
Have you seen him lately?

662
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,750
I was getting my sewing machine
fixed across the street...

663
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:24,790
and he was sitting in the window
of his shop just staring.

664
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,070
That is strange.

665
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,670
It's your bid, Betty.

666
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,870
What goes on up at Lovers Lane?

667
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,710
What do you mean?

668
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,310
Well, you hear
these things lately...

669
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:01,150
kids spending so much time
up there.

670
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,670
Is it holding hands?
That kind of thing?

671
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,830
That and...

672
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,230
What?

673
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,350
It doesn't matter.

674
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,910
No. I want to know.

675
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:21,150
Well... sex.

676
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,510
What's sex?

677
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,470
You sure you want to know this?

678
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,990
Well...

679
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,990
You see, Mom...

680
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,230
when two people really love
each other very, very much...

681
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,630
and they want to share that...

682
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,550
Are you OK?

683
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,630
It's just that...

684
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,110
your father would never
do anything like that.

685
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,390
Well, you know, Mom...

686
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,390
there are other ways
to enjoy yourself...

687
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:24,550
without Dad.

688
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,950
Sweetie, you coming to bed?

689
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:46,950
Yeah. I'm just going
to take a bath first.

690
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,390
Oh, my goodness.

691
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,630
Oh, shit.

692
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:16,830
Oh, God.

693
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,590
Fire!

694
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,310
Cat?

695
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,630
OK, right here.

696
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,830
All right, stop.

697
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,270
Stop!

698
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,110
Where is it?

699
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:09,230
Whoa!

700
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,950
Here, grab the nozzle.

701
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,870
- But where's the cat?
- Just hold on tight.

702
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,030
Whoa!

703
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,990
So that's what these things do.

704
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:34,670
In honor and in recognition
of your heroism...

705
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,830
and with great appreciation from
the citizens of Pleasantville...

706
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:42,150
I am pleased to present you with
this special commendation...

707
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,350
from the Pleasantville
Chamber of Commerce.

708
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,830
- That sure was swell.
- Thank you, Margaret.

709
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:14,230
I baked you
some of my oatmeal cookies.

710
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,830
Oh, no.
You baked those for Whitey.

711
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,070
No. I baked them for you.

712
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,670
No. You baked them for Whitey.

713
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,150
- I baked them for you.
- No...

714
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,030
No. I baked them for you.

715
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,270
Thank you.

716
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,430
Sure.

717
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,470
What's going on?

718
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,030
I'm not sure.
They want to ask you a question.

719
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,070
I didn't really know
how to handle it.

720
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,150
How you doing?

721
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,790
You wanted to ask me something?

722
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,750
How'd you know about the fire?

723
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:43,750
What?

724
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,510
How'd you know
how to put it out?

725
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:57,230
Well, where I used to live,
that's just what firemen did.

726
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,670
And where's that?

727
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,230
Outside of Pleasantville.

728
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,830
What's outside of Pleasantville?

729
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:22,310
It doesn't matter.
It's not important.

730
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,710
What's outside of Pleasantville?

731
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,790
There are some places...

732
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:51,630
that the road doesn't go
in a circle.

733
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:54,510
There are some places
where the road keeps going.

734
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:55,830
Keeps going?

735
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,830
Keeps going?

736
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,230
Yeah, it just keeps going.

737
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:06,630
It all keeps going.
Roads and rivers.

738
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,430
Like the mighty Mississippi?

739
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:09,630
What?

740
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,710
I thought the books were blank.

741
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,150
They were.

742
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,790
This was not my fault.

743
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,230
When they asked me
what it was about...

744
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:28,110
I didn't remember because
I read it back in tenth grade.

745
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,590
When I told them
what I did remember...

746
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,390
that's when the pages filled in.

747
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,550
The pages filled in?

748
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,470
But only up until the part
with the raft...

749
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,230
'cause that's as far as I read.

750
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,230
Do you know how it ends?

751
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,830
- Yeah, I do.
- So how does it end?

752
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,750
Well, OK.

753
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,670
Let's see,
they were running away...

754
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,430
Huck and the slave.

755
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:01,070
They were going up the river,
trying to get free.

756
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,110
And, in trying to get free...

757
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:07,710
they see that
they're sort of free already.

758
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,230
Oh, my God.

759
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,630
What about this one?

760
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,750
Oh, yeah. This is great.

761
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:29,670
This kid Holden Caulfield.
He's a really lonely kid.

762
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,990
He gets kicked out
of boarding school.

763
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:53,150
Look at 'em.

764
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,110
It's spreadin'
all over the place.

765
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:56,470
Look at her books.

766
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,030
Look at her sweater.

767
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:03,350
Going up to that lake
all the time is one thing...

768
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,270
but now they're going
to a library?

769
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,710
What's next?

770
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:11,150
You're right.

771
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,150
Somebody ought
to do something about that.

772
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,790
Soon.

773
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,630
You're probably wondering...

774
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,470
why I asked to stop by
and see you today.

775
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,310
I'm sure you've noticed
the same things we all have.

776
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:39,070
Certain changes in the town.

777
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:42,390
You know what I mean by changes?

778
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:44,870
Changes.

779
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:46,750
Changes.

780
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:50,390
And I'm not just talking
about big stuff like the fire.

781
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,990
It's the little things.
Did you hear about Bill Miller?

782
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,310
No. What?

783
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,510
Wife wants him
to get one of those new beds.

784
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:59,270
One of those big beds?

785
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:03,190
Oh, my gosh. What's he gonna do?

786
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:05,190
I don't know. It's everywhere.

787
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:07,630
Bill Anderson's boy
just quit his job at the market.

788
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:08,910
Quit?

789
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,270
Just took his apron off right in
the middle of an order...

790
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,270
said,
"I don't feel like it anymore."

791
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,150
Groceries all over the counter.

792
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,550
Took 'em three hours
just to sort it out.

793
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:23,350
Everybody
really likes you, George.

794
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,830
- Well...
- No, they do.

795
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,670
Not just 'cause you're a good
bowler. People respect you.

796
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,630
Well, thank you.

797
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:33,310
It's important for them to see
someone they respect...

798
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,190
stand up for what's right.

799
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,830
If you love a place,
you can't just sit back...

800
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:41,030
and watch this kind of thing
happen, can you?

801
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,950
No, of course not.

802
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,870
That is why I want you
to be a member...

803
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,990
of the Pleasantville
Chamber of Commerce.

804
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,470
Oh, my gosh.

805
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,390
I hardly know what to say.

806
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,990
It's just like yours.

807
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,950
It is exactly like mine, George.

808
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,710
You can start by saying yes.

809
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:11,350
And by getting me one of
those swell pineapple kabobs.

810
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,150
Well, sure. You bet!

811
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:14,750
Betty, Bob wants to try...

812
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,710
some of your great
hors d'oeuvres.

813
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,590
I'll get her.

814
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,870
Are you OK?

815
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,070
You all right?

816
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,310
What am I going to do?

817
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:05,150
I can't go out there this way.

818
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,870
How can I go out there this way?

819
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,830
Look at me.

820
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,230
It's OK. It's all right.

821
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,870
Have you got any makeup?

822
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,870
In my handbag.

823
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:37,030
Honey, where are you?

824
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:40,110
Here. Give me your cheek.

825
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,870
Here. Give me the other. There.

826
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:52,470
That's good.
Now lift your chin up.

827
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,190
- Is it working?
- Yes.

828
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:57,590
Here, look at me.

829
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,350
What?

830
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:22,950
Does it look OK?

831
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,710
Yeah. It looks just like it did.

832
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,630
And they won't be able to tell?

833
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:33,190
No, they won't be able to tell.

834
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:36,630
Betty, are you in there?

835
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:37,870
Boy...

836
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:54,750
Coming, sweetie.

837
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:10,070
Aren't you a little bit early?

838
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:13,350
I brought you something
from the library.

839
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:15,870
It's an art book.

840
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,910
Oh, my gosh, Bud.

841
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:23,710
Since you liked to paint,
it might help to...

842
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,950
Gee whiz.

843
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:49,430
Who is... Titian?

844
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,230
I'm not sure.

845
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,110
It's beautiful, Bud.

846
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:55,950
What's wrong?

847
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,390
No, it's just...

848
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,630
I'll never be able to do that.

849
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:04,270
Well, you just started.
I mean, you can't do it now.

850
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,150
That's not it.

851
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,950
Just where am I gonna see
colors like that?

852
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:14,910
Must be awful lucky
to see colors like that.

853
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:18,550
I'll bet they don't know
how lucky they are.

854
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:29,270
- How you doing?
- Swell.

855
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:33,750
Look, you probably don't think
I should be asking you this.

856
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,830
Will you go out with me tonight?

857
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:48,990
Hey, Mr. Simpson,
your lawn looks great.

858
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,270
Well, come here, young fella.

859
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:11,550
You know, I've been thinking.

860
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:13,310
I might have been
a little hasty the other day...

861
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,470
when you asked to come home.

862
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:19,270
It just took me
by such surprise, you know?

863
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:22,510
So even though
I can't make any promises...

864
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,870
I figured
if you asked me real nice...

865
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:27,790
I might just be willing
to talk about it again.

866
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:31,110
- I can't.
- What?

867
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,310
Talk about it right now.

868
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,470
I'll be honest with you, Bud.
I'm getting concerned...

869
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:38,310
about what I'm seeing
on some of these reruns.

870
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:39,710
Reruns?

871
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:43,510
Like when Margaret Henderson
makes her cookies for Whitey.

872
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,790
Those are not your cookies, Bud.

873
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:48,030
I know they're not my cookies...

874
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:51,230
Those are Whitey's cookies, Bud.
They belong to him.

875
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,950
Then he eats them and asks her
to go to Lovers Lane...

876
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,910
I would love to talk about
all this right now...

877
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:59,030
but I am really in a hurry.
I can't hear you!

878
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,070
It's really cruddy reception!
We'll talk later!

879
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:14,870
What's wrong?

880
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,550
Listen...

881
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:20,550
You're reading.

882
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:23,270
I can't believe you started
such a dorky fad.

883
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,910
It's D. H...

884
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,030
Lawrence.

885
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,710
You ever heard of him?

886
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:33,430
Yeah, I read a couple of pages.
Seemed kind of sexy.

887
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:35,310
It is.

888
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:38,590
Can I ask you a question?

889
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,670
Sure.

890
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,670
How come
I'm still in black and white?

891
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:47,790
What?

892
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,710
I've had
10 times as much sex...

893
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:53,830
as the rest of these girls,
and I still look like this.

894
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,950
I mean, they spend like an hour
in the back seat of some car...

895
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:57,630
and all of a sudden,
they're in Technicolor?

896
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:02,990
I don't know.
Maybe it's not just the sex.

897
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,870
Where is it?

898
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:16,270
A little bit farther, I think.

899
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:20,190
WKPV,
the sounds of Pleasantville.

900
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:23,510
Here's a new one for
all you kids out at Lovers Lane.

901
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:44,110
Wow.

902
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:26,470
It's amazing, huh?

903
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,630
We're closed right now.

904
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,830
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

905
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,190
Hi. I just thought that...

906
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:16,030
No. Come on in.

907
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:22,110
It's beautiful.

908
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:25,590
Thanks.

909
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,670
I was just trying to do
one of these still lifes.

910
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,590
Kind of having a tough time.

911
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:32,510
I think it looks nice.

912
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,390
Well, here's what
it's supposed to look like.

913
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,550
Oh, my.

914
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,710
Here. Look at this.

915
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,790
- Where did you get this?
- Bud brought it to me.

916
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:50,870
- My Bud?
- Yeah. Here's my favorite.

917
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,790
What do you think?

918
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:59,670
Isn't it great
how she's resting like that?

919
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,310
She's crying.

920
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:04,990
No, she's not.

921
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:07,630
Yes, she is.

922
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,510
- Wait.
- No. I've got to go.

923
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,190
It's all right. Let me see.

924
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,710
It's beautiful.

925
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,590
It's beautiful.

926
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:51,390
You shouldn't cover that up.

927
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:04,150
Here. Let me just...

928
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,110
So what's it like?

929
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,470
- What?
- Out there.

930
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,950
Well, it's...

931
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:49,790
It's louder, and...

932
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:52,190
scarier, I guess.

933
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:55,670
And it's a lot more dangerous.

934
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:57,470
Sounds fantastic.

935
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:01,430
The other night, some kids
came up to go swimming...

936
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,430
and they took off
all their clothes.

937
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:08,790
Do you want some berries?

938
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,750
Some berries.
I picked them myself.

939
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:13,150
Really?

940
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,070
Yeah, there's lots of stuff.

941
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,350
Like what?

942
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:20,870
Here, I'll show you.

943
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:35,190
Here.

944
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:36,670
Go ahead. Try it.

945
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:51,110
What are you doing?

946
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:53,030
It's 6:30.

947
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:54,750
So?

948
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,590
We were gonna...

949
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:59,190
You know.

950
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:02,550
Oh, I can't.

951
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,350
- Why not?
- I'm busy.

952
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:10,110
- With what?
- I'm studying.

953
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,550
Good evening.

954
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,670
Good evening.

955
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:19,070
Evening.

956
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:21,190
- George.
- Good evening, Norm.

957
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:43,870
Honey, I'm home.

958
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:58,950
Honey, I'm home.

959
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,750
- What was that?
- I don't know.

960
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,710
What is that?

961
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:41,230
What's going on?

962
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:42,870
It's rain.

963
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:44,230
Real rain?

964
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:46,870
You don't have rain either?

965
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:50,350
Well, of course you don't.
It's OK.

966
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,670
Here, come on.

967
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,270
What's going on?

968
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:04,750
It's rain.

969
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:07,510
It's OK. It's fine.

970
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:10,350
There's nothing to be scared of.

971
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:14,070
Here, I'll show you.

972
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:19,710
It's just rain. It's OK.

973
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,110
It's fine. Come on out.

974
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:24,150
You see? Look!

975
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:26,030
You see?

976
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:30,030
Come on! Come on!

977
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,230
It's cold.

978
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:41,470
Cool.

979
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,790
Honey, I'm home.

980
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:01,350
Where's my dinner?

981
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:20,790
Where's my dinner?

982
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,670
Where's my dinner?

983
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:10,470
What happened?

984
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:13,990
Are you all right?

985
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:16,750
What is it?

986
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:24,870
Rain.

987
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:26,910
Real rain?

988
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,190
Oh, my God.

989
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:38,590
Are you all right?

990
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:42,510
I came home like I always do...

991
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:44,510
and I went in the front door...

992
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,350
and I took off my coat...

993
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,710
and I put down my briefcase...

994
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:51,390
and I said, "Honey, I'm home."

995
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:53,310
Only there was no one there.

996
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,750
No wife.

997
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:58,270
No lights.

998
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,270
- No dinner.
- No dinner?

999
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:05,030
I went to the oven.

1000
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:07,470
I thought maybe she had made me
one of those TV dinners.

1001
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:08,630
Yeah, sure.

1002
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,190
She hadn't.

1003
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:12,030
She was gone.

1004
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:15,310
I looked and looked and looked.

1005
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,270
She was gone.

1006
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,910
It's gonna be fine, George.

1007
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,550
You're with us now.

1008
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:29,070
What are we gonna do, Bob?

1009
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,390
Well, we're safe for now.

1010
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,590
Thank goodness
we're in a bowling alley.

1011
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:38,470
But if George here
doesn't get his dinner...

1012
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,790
any one of us could be next.

1013
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:42,590
It could be you, Gus.

1014
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:44,550
Or you, Roy.

1015
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:46,670
Or even you, Ralph.

1016
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,990
That is real rain out there,
gentlemen.

1017
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:53,310
This isn't some little virus
that'll clear up on its own.

1018
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:55,990
Something is happening
to our town.

1019
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:00,790
And I think we can all see
where it's coming from.

1020
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:07,070
Why don't you show them
what you showed me before?

1021
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:11,990
It's OK, Roy. Come on up here.

1022
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:20,670
I know, Roy.

1023
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,750
Thanks.

1024
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:34,190
He asked her what she was doing.

1025
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:36,590
She said nothing.
She was just thinking.

1026
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:41,030
My friends, this isn't
about George's dinner.

1027
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:43,590
It's not about Roy's shirt.

1028
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:45,310
It's a question of values.

1029
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:46,910
It's a question of whether...

1030
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:49,470
we want to hold on
to those values...

1031
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,150
that made this place great.

1032
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:55,910
So a time has come
to make a decision.

1033
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:59,550
Are we in this thing alone...

1034
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,590
or are we in it together?

1035
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,390
Together.

1036
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,390
- I told you where I was.
- All night?

1037
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:01,550
I got caught in the storm.
You were gone all night, too.

1038
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:03,430
Look...

1039
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:07,030
Let's just forget about it.
We'll just go to the meeting.

1040
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:10,110
No. I told you, George,
I'm not going to that meeting.

1041
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:13,350
- Sure you are.
- No, I'm not.

1042
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:15,710
Look at me, George.

1043
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:20,190
Look at my face.
That meeting's not for me.

1044
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,070
You'll put on some makeup.

1045
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:23,950
I don't want
to put on some makeup.

1046
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:27,670
It goes away. It'll go away.

1047
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:31,750
I don't want it to go away.

1048
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:37,670
Now, you listen to me.

1049
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:42,550
You're coming to this meeting.

1050
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:44,630
You're going to put on
some makeup.

1051
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:47,350
You're going to be home
at 6:00 every night...

1052
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:50,590
and you're going to have dinner
ready on this table.

1053
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:57,390
No, I'm not, sweetie.

1054
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:08,790
I made you a meat loaf.

1055
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:14,550
Put it in the oven and turn
this little knob up to 350.

1056
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,590
If you put the pie in
40 minutes later...

1057
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:21,110
it'll be hot
in time for dessert.

1058
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:27,630
I made a couple of lunches
for you for tomorrow...

1059
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:30,710
and put them
in brown paper bags.

1060
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:36,710
I'm going to go now.

1061
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,950
Where are you gonna go?

1062
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:41,470
I'm going to go now.

1063
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:48,350
Don't go out there like that.
They'll see you.

1064
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,110
They'll see you.

1065
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:52,990
Betty, come back here!

1066
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:55,430
It's beautiful. Can I open it?

1067
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:56,630
Sure.

1068
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:01,710
Where'd you get it?

1069
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,990
It was a prop
from the school play.

1070
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,710
Thank you.

1071
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,430
Whitey.

1072
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:29,270
Hey, Bud, why aren't you
at the town meeting right now?

1073
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:30,950
No reason. How come you're not?

1074
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:35,070
We're supposed to go around
and let everyone know about it.

1075
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,430
I thought maybe it was
because you were too busy...

1076
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:40,710
entertaining
your colored girlfriend.

1077
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:43,110
Why don't you guys
get the hell out of here?

1078
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:46,390
All right. We'll do that.

1079
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:51,030
Margaret, you can come over and
make those oatmeal cookies...

1080
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:52,830
for me anytime you want to.

1081
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,230
People.

1082
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:02,550
People!

1083
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:04,870
Roy Campbell's
got a blue front door.

1084
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:07,710
- It's always been blue.
- People.

1085
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:10,670
People, please.

1086
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,110
Please.

1087
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,790
I think we all know
what's been going on here.

1088
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:18,390
Up until now...

1089
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:23,910
everything around here has
always been, well, pleasant.

1090
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:27,590
Recently, certain things
have become unpleasant.

1091
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:32,110
Now, it seems to me...

1092
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:34,550
that the first thing
we have to do...

1093
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:37,550
is to separate out the things
that are pleasant...

1094
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:39,670
from the things
that are unpleasant.

1095
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:44,350
That's Betty Parker, isn't it?

1096
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:46,310
That is an outrage.

1097
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,630
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1098
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,950
Get in here. Now!

1099
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:11,950
You think this is a toy?

1100
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:15,070
You think it's your own little
goddamn coloring book?

1101
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:16,270
It just sort of happened.

1102
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:18,310
A deluge doesn't just happen.

1103
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,350
Bolts of lightning
don't just happen.

1104
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:22,110
I didn't do anything wrong.

1105
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:24,550
Oh, no?
Let me show you something.

1106
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:26,790
Go on, try it.

1107
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:31,310
Boom! Right there!
What do you call that?

1108
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:33,270
You don't deserve this place.

1109
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:35,830
You don't deserve
to live in this paradise.

1110
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,390
Where's the remote control
I gave you?

1111
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:38,550
Why?

1112
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,150
Because you're coming home,
you little twerp...

1113
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:42,830
and I'm gonna put this place
back the way it was.

1114
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:44,990
I can't let you do that.

1115
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:46,910
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna let you do that.

1116
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:49,510
Just give me the damn remote!

1117
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:50,670
I'm gonna go now.

1118
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:51,670
You're not going anywhere.

1119
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:54,190
You're gonna get that remote
and come home...

1120
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:57,470
and we're gonna make
everybody happy again.

1121
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,910
Where you going in such a hurry?

1122
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:02,110
That's not real friendly.

1123
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:05,150
Let's see if
she looks like her picture.

1124
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:07,390
You want to be friendly,
don't you?

1125
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:10,070
Why don't you show us what's
under that nice blue dress?

1126
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,710
Yeah, come on!

1127
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:16,830
Where you going?
There's nowhere to go.

1128
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:20,750
That is a lovely shade of blue.

1129
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:23,630
Don't you think
that's a lovely shade of blue?

1130
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:37,630
Get out of here!

1131
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:40,310
Go on! Get out of here!

1132
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:44,830
Are you OK?

1133
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:52,750
What?

1134
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:18,710
It's OK. He's not in there.

1135
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:34,710
It's OK. All right?

1136
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:38,110
I'm gonna get you out of here,
all right?

1137
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:39,350
Are you OK?

1138
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:44,110
Keep 'em coming!

1139
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,630
No, Mary Sue,
it's better this way.

1140
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,990
This is the only book I've ever
read in my whole life...

1141
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:58,070
and you're not gonna put it
on that fire!

1142
01:27:58,110 --> 01:27:59,830
Just give me the book!

1143
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:08,430
It's me.

1144
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:40,430
Let's go inside.

1145
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:09,110
Just thought
I'd try to tidy it up a bit.

1146
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:19,590
It's OK. It's OK.

1147
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:22,430
Once we sweep it up,
it'll be all right again.

1148
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:34,230
He's right. Let's...

1149
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:35,910
Help me with this, will you?

1150
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:37,310
Sure.

1151
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:40,510
Good. Put this up in here.

1152
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,710
People!

1153
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:49,190
People!

1154
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:54,910
This is not the answer, people.

1155
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:57,430
No matter how upset
we may get...

1156
01:29:57,470 --> 01:30:00,190
or how frustrated we may be...

1157
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:03,150
we're not gonna solve
our problems out in the street.

1158
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:05,550
It's just the wrong way
to do it.

1159
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:08,310
We have to find
a code of conduct...

1160
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:10,670
that we can all agree
to live by.

1161
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:15,310
I asked George and Ralph here
to sketch out a few ideas...

1162
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:18,750
and I think they've done
a terrific job.

1163
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:21,510
If we can all agree to these,
we can take a vote...

1164
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:24,830
and I think we can start off
in the right direction.

1165
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:30,630
"One... all public disruption
and acts of vandalism...

1166
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:32,670
"are to cease immediately.

1167
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:36,670
"Two... all citizens

01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:41,550
"in a courteous
and pleasant manner."

1170
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:45,470
"Courteous and pleasant manner."
That's not too bad.

1171
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:49,230
"Three... the area commonly known
as Lovers Lane...

1172

1173
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:53,710

1174
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:59,310
"Four... the only permissible
recorded music...

1175
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:01,070

1176
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:03,750

1179
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:10,670
"In no event

1180
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:13,350
"that is not of a temperate
or pleasant nature."

1181
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:19,670
"Five... there shall be
no public sale of umbrellas...

1182
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:23,030

1183
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:29,350
"Six... no bed frame

1184
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:30,710

1185
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:37,150
"Seven... the only permissible

1186

"shall be black, white,

1187
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:44,070
"despite the recent availability

1188
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:49,990
"Eight... all elementary

1191
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,430
Wow.

1192
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,310
Hey...

1193
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:05,670
this thing still works.

1194
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:07,790
Turn that off!

1195
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:09,910
You're not allowed
to do that now!

1196
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:17,630
Sure you are.

1197
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:24,750
Wow, this is good.

1198
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:26,630
You just do it?

1199
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:34,030
Don't worry.
We'll get you a new one.

1200
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:38,830
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't paint anymore.

1201
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:48,790
Maybe I have an idea.

1202
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:35,190
Shameless.

1203
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:56,790
When are they gonna
let them out?

1204
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:59,270
Hey, what are you kids
doing out there?

1205
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:03,510
There's someone to see you, Bud.

1206
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:13,750
Is this a bad time?

1207
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:16,150
No, it's fine. Come on in.

1208
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:20,190
I brought you something.

1209
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:22,630
Thank you.

1210
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:25,150
- Cocktail olives.
- Everything else was frozen.

1211
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:26,910
I didn't know how to...

1212
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:28,270
I appreciate it.

1213
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:35,350
- Your mom went out.
- Went out?

1214
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:37,510
Yeah.
She went out for a little while.

1215
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:39,270
When?

1216
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:42,590
Three days ago.

1217
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:50,190
Jeez, everything is so cockeyed.

1218
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:52,910
I didn't even know
it was Tuesday.

1219
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:55,390
Tuesday we play bridge
with the Jenkins.

1220
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:58,190
There was no bridge. It's...

1221
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:03,550
Can I have one of those?

1222
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:05,230
Sure. Yeah. You hungry?

1223
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:10,230
Mrs. Benson was making
meat loaf next door.

1224
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:12,270
I almost climbed in
her kitchen window.

1225
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:19,710
What happened?
One minute, everything's fine.

1226
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,710
The next...

1227
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:25,070
What went wrong?

1228
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:28,430
Nothing went wrong.
People change.

1229
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:29,830
People change?

1230
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:32,030
Yeah, people change.

1231
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:34,550
Can they change back?

1232
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,390
I don't know.
I think it's harder.

1233
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:45,350
You OK?

1234
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:50,190
Yeah. Not fair, you know?

1235
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:52,150
You get used to one thing and...

1236
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:54,830
I know. It's not.

1237
01:37:58,270 --> 01:38:00,950
Bud Parker, William Johnson...

1238
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:03,870
you are charged with desecration
of a public building...

1239
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:06,190
and with the intentional use
of prohibited paint colors...

1240
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:08,190
in violation of the
Pleasantville code of conduct...

1241
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:09,910
and laws of common decency.

1242
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:12,390
Do you admit
that on the night of May 1st...

1243
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:14,190
you did willfully
and consciously apply...

1244
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:16,030
the following
forbidden paint colors...

1245
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:18,870
to the north wall of the
Pleasantville police station...

1246
01:38:18,910 --> 01:38:21,910
red, pink, vermilion, puce,
chartreuse...

1247
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:25,950
umber, blue, aqua, oxblood,
green, peach, crimson...

1248
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:29,110
yellow, olive, and magenta?

1249
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:32,190
Yeah, I do. Where's our lawyer?

1250
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:34,590
I think we want to keep
these proceedings...

1251
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:36,430
as pleasant as possible.

1252
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:38,510
I don't think a lawyer
will be necessary.

1253
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:44,710
Do you further admit
that this unnatural depiction...

1254
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:47,150
occurred in full public view
where it was accessible to...

1255
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:49,430
and in plain sight
of minor children?

1256
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:51,870
It was accessible to everyone.

1257
01:38:51,870 --> 01:38:54,710
Let the record show that
the defendants have answered...

1258
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,870
in the affirmative
to all charges.

1259
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:00,030
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?

1260
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:02,270
Yeah, I do...

1261
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:09,190
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

1262
01:39:13,630 --> 01:39:17,550
Maybe if I painted
something different.

1263
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:20,190
Or maybe I could use
less colors or something.

1264
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:23,870
Or, you know, certain colors.
Or maybe I could...

1265
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:26,830
You could pick out
the colors beforehand...

1266
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:28,630
and then they wouldn't
bother anybody.

1267
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:31,470
- I've got something to say.
- Very well.

1268
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:33,470
You don't have a right
to do this.

1269
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:38,750
I mean...

1270
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:40,910
I know you want it
to stay pleasant around here...

1271
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:46,190
but there are so many things...

1272
01:39:46,190 --> 01:39:48,230
that are so much better.

1273
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:52,270
Like silly or sexy...

1274
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:56,830
or dangerous or brief.

1275
01:39:56,870 --> 01:40:02,430
And every one of those things
is in you all the time...

1276
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:04,310
if you just have the guts
to look for them.

1277
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,630
That's enough.

1278
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:07,310
I thought I was allowed
to defend myself.

1279
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:09,470
- You're not allowed to lie.
- I'm not lying.

1280
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:13,910
You see those faces up there?
They're no different than you.

1281
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,950
They just see something
inside themselves...

1282
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:18,070
I said that's enough.

1283
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:19,830
I'll show you. Dad?

1284
01:40:19,870 --> 01:40:21,830
Yeah, Bud?

1285
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:26,790
It's OK, Dad.
Just listen for a sec.

1286
01:40:26,830 --> 01:40:28,590
I know you miss her.

1287
01:40:28,630 --> 01:40:31,950
I mean, you told me you did...

1288
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:36,750
but maybe it's not just
the cooking or the cleaning...

1289
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,990
that you miss.

1290
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:42,390
Maybe it's something else.

1291
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:46,670
Maybe you can't even
describe it.

1292
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:49,390
Maybe you only know it
when it's gone.

1293
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:54,550
Maybe it's like
there's a whole piece of you...

1294
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:55,790
that's missing, too.

1295
01:41:01,070 --> 01:41:02,710
Look at her, Dad.

1296
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:08,550
Doesn't she look pretty
like that?

1297
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:15,030
Doesn't she look
just as beautiful...

1298
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:16,830
as the first time you met her?

1299
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:21,750
You really want her back
the way she was?

1300
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:32,910
Doesn't she look wonderful?

1301
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:41,950
Now, don't you wish
you could tell her that?

1302
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:54,190
You're out of order.

1303
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:56,150
Why am I out of order?

1304
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:58,430
I'm not gonna let you turn
this courtroom into a circus.

1305
01:41:58,430 --> 01:42:01,510
I don't think it's a circus.
I don't think they do, either.

1306
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:05,910
This behavior must stop at once.

1307
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:08,230
That's just the point.

1308
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:09,910
It can't stop at once
because it's in you...

1309
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:12,550
and you can't stop
something inside you.

1310
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:13,870
It is not inside me.

1311
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:15,950
- Sure it is.
- No, it is not.

1312
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:21,070
What do you want to do to me
right now?

1313
01:42:21,110 --> 01:42:25,670
Come on.
Everyone is turning colors.

1314
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:27,710
Kids are making out
in the street.

1315
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:30,870
No one is getting their dinner.
Hell, you could have a flood.

1316
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:33,430
Pretty soon, the women
could be going off to work...

1317
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:35,510
while the men stayed at home
and cooked.

1318
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:37,790
- That is not going to happen.
- But it could!

1319
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:39,710
No, it could not!

1320
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:14,230
Hey, look at this!

1321
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:58,110
What an image.

1322
01:43:58,110 --> 01:43:59,430
Shut up.

1323
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:50,510
You sure you don't
want to come home?

1324
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:53,390
Yeah. I gotta do this
for a little while.

1325
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:55,430
Besides, you think
I even have a chance...

1326
01:44:55,470 --> 01:44:57,950
of getting into college
back there?

1327
01:44:57,990 --> 01:44:59,270
Honestly?

1328
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:06,590
- Got your admissions letter?
- Right here.

1329
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:11,110
I did the slut thing, David.

1330
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:13,310
Got kinda old.

1331
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:16,870
I'll come back
and check on you soon.

1332
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:36,270
You turned into
a pretty cool guy.

1333
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:39,070
How'd that happen?

1334
01:45:39,110 --> 01:45:40,230
I don't know.

1335
01:45:42,550 --> 01:45:43,670
I'll see you.

1336
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:06,550
Just don't forget about me.

1337
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:10,630
Even if you never come back.

1338
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:12,270
I just don't want you
to forget about me.

1339
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:13,910
I couldn't do that.

1340
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:26,350
- Here.
- What's this?

1341
01:46:26,390 --> 01:46:29,270
Lots of stuff.
A meat loaf sandwich...

1342
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:31,230
And a hard-boiled egg...

1343
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:33,590
and some marshmallow
rice squares.

1344
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:39,430
There's some fried chicken
in there, too.

1345
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:44,190
Don't skip dinner just 'cause
you're not here anymore.

1346
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:46,710
I won't.
I thought you weren't...

1347
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:49,390
I had to come say good-bye.

1348
01:46:56,150 --> 01:46:59,230
Just wear this on the trip...

1349
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:02,790
in case it gets cold.

1350
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:04,430
It's a pretty short trip.

1351
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:06,230
Still...

1352
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:19,430
I am just so proud of you.

1353
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:21,070
Thanks.

1354
01:47:24,830 --> 01:47:26,110
I know.

1355
01:47:26,150 --> 01:47:27,590
I love you, too.

1356
01:47:37,030 --> 01:47:38,550
Well...

1357
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:42,750
Well...

1358
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:45,430
I guess you better stand back.

1359
01:48:37,990 --> 01:48:40,550
That concludes the first hour
of the Pleasantville marathon.

1360
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:41,710
Don't forget...

1361
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:43,390
we'll be going all night long
until noon tomorrow...

1362
01:49:21,510 --> 01:49:23,430
I thought you went out of town.

1363
01:49:23,470 --> 01:49:25,150
Came back.

1364
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:31,790
What's wrong?

1365
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:34,790
I don't know.
Everything's so fucked up.

1366
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:38,390
I got halfway down there
and thought, "What am I doing?"

1367
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:40,390
He's nine years younger
than I am.

1368
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:42,790
Doesn't make me feel younger.
Makes me feel older.

1369
01:49:46,270 --> 01:49:49,590
When your father was here,
I used to think this was it.

1370
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:51,310
This was the way
it was always going to be.

1371
01:49:51,350 --> 01:49:53,510
I had the right house,
the right car...

1372
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:55,430
the right life...

1373
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:58,070
There is no right house,
there is no right car.

1374
01:50:01,710 --> 01:50:03,830
God, my face must be a mess.

1375
01:50:04,830 --> 01:50:06,350
It looks great.

1376
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:10,310
That's really sweet, but
I'm sure it does not look great.

1377
01:50:10,350 --> 01:50:11,790
Sure, it does.

1378
01:50:19,190 --> 01:50:20,750
Come here.

1379
01:50:22,430 --> 01:50:25,150
I'm 40. It's not supposed
to be like this.

1380
01:50:25,190 --> 01:50:27,830
It's not supposed
to be anything.

1381
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:29,150
Hold still.

1382
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:35,430
How'd you get so smart
all of a sudden?

1383
01:50:38,510 --> 01:50:40,910
I had a good day.

1384
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:19,070
So what's gonna happen now?

1385
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:26,390
I don't know.

1386
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,910
Do you know
what's going to happen now?

1387
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:33,470
No. I don't.

1388
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:49,190
I guess I don't, either.
