lt was Saturday afternoon
and she was bored.

May's mood ring, which she'd found
in a cereal box, was grey

18
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:21,479
which, according to the chart,

19
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:23,680
meant she was either pensive,
unconsciously ambitious or hungy.

20
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:30,639
Her only friends were 'The Noblets'
from her favourite cartoon.

21
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:34,599
They weren't the real ones
you bought in the shops

22
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:37,919
but fake ones she had to make herself
from shells, gumnuts, pompoms

23
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,159
and the chicken bones salvaged
from Friday night's takeaway.

24
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,080
She had to make all her own toys,
and her favourites were Shrinkies -

25
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,240
potato chip packets that
she had shrunk in the oven.

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,159
worked in a factoy,
attaching the strings to tea bags.

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:09,319
he could get as many free tea bags
as he wanted.

32
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:14,439
Her favourite tea bag was Earl Grey.

33
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:18,199
She loved saying 'Earl Grey'

34
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,360
and would like one day to mary
someone called Earl Grey.

Noel's hobby was to sit in his shed
and drink Baileys Irish Cream

41
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,480
and stufF birds he'd found
on the side of the freeway.

42
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,480
May wished he'd spend more time
with her and less with his dead friends.

43
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,079
She also wished she had
some brothers and sisters.

44
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,120
Her mother had told her
she was 'an accident'.

45
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:00,199
How could someone be an accident?

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Grandpoppy Ralph had told her
that babies were deliberate

47
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,360
and found by dads
at the bottom of their beer.

48

Grandpoppy Ralph
had smelt like pickled onions

and had been a member of the Frankston
Ice Breakers for 51 years.

Grandpoppy Ralph had said
it made his nipples erect.

53

He had died the year before, aged 74,

54
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:35,399

had recited a poem in his honour.

Vera Lorraine Dinkle.

62

(Radio3: A pretty vicious ball.

was always shery.

May also couldn't understand
why Vera was always 'borrowing'.

75

Yesterday, she borrowed
some fish fingers from Aisle 6.

76

She told May she put things
up her dress to save on plastic bags.

Meanwhile, a man called Max Horowi_
also watched 'The Noblets'.

Max's small television
had picture but no sound.

His big television, sound but no picture.

He was 44 and liked 'The Noblets'

(erm...) 'borrowed' some envelopes.

To fill in time, she scanned the room

were brown.

how old they were

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:23,480
He doesn't lay eggs but will one day.

160
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,520
(Pop!)

161
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,880
My mother likes smoking,
cricket and shery

162
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:30,960
and my father likes playing in his shed
with dead birds.

163
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:36,279
Where do babies come from
in America?

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Do they come from cola cans?

165
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,360
ln Australia
they are found in beer glasses.

166
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Here is a drawing of me.

167
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,160
l can't draw ears proper
but l'm good at teeth.

168
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:51,039
lt would be great if you could write back
and be my friend.

169
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,360
Yours 'sincerealy', May Daisy Dinkle.

170
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,440
PS. l hope you like the chocolate bar
l'm also sending.

171
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,200
lt's called a Chery Ripe.

172
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
(Dogs bark and rooster crows)

173
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,520
(She strains)

174
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,960
Goodbye, letter. Don't forget to write.

176
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,640
(Max wheezes)

(Lift bell dings)

178
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,080
(Narrator): Max hated Thursdays -

179
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,160
the day of his weekly
Overeaters Anonymous meeting.

180
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,240
And tonight he'd felt
especially unsettled

181
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:04,600
because he'd eaten two chocolate
hotdogs on his way there.

182
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,080
(Teacher): OK, cIass...

183
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,640
Eating chocolate was breaking the rules.

184
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:13,759
He'd found the night
even more unbearable

185
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,600
because of Mariorie Butterworth's
strange glances.

186
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,960
(Teacher3: Class dismissed.

187
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:21,039
Max had trouble understanding
non-verbal signals.

188
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,200
Flirting was as foreign to him
as jogging.

189
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
(Lift bell dings repeatedly)

190
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,240
Max found most people vey confusing.

191
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:40,720
But little did Max realise

192
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,520
his night was about to become
even more confusing and cyptic.

193
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,320
(Max3: Hmm.

194
00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:01,280
He read May's letter four times
and then did what he normally did

195
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,760
whenever confronted
with something new and stressful.

196
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,640
(Mutters anxiously)

197
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,520
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

198
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:14,879
Max's fragile existence
had once again become unsettled.

199
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,240
And after staring out of the window
for 1$ hours

200
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,000
he finally made a decision.

201
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,960
(Takes a deep breath)

202
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,840
('Typewriter music' plays quickly
in time with Max's typing)

203
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,120
(Max): Dear May Daisy Dinkle,

204
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:50,759
thank you for the letter,
which l opened and read at 9.1 7pm

205
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,720
after my Overeaters Anonymous class.

206
00:15:59,799 --> 00:15:59,799
l am tying to lose weight

207
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,600
because my psychiatrist,
Dr Bernard Hazelhof,

208
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,360
says a healthy body
equals a healthy mind.

209
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Ooooh!

210
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,240
He says my mind is not that healthy.

211
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Your drawing is an interesting
visual portrayal of yourself.

212
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:19,600
l have never met anyone from Australia.

213
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,440
Firstly, l will answer your question.

214
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:28,279
Unfortunately, in America,
babies are not found in cola cans.

215
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,360
l asked my mother when l was four

216
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,240
and she said they came from eggs
Iaid by rabbis.

217
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,320
lf you aren't Jewish,
they're laid by Catholic nuns.

218
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:44,679
lf you're an atheist,
they're laid by dim, lonely prostitutes.

219
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,480
So this is where babies come from
in America.

220
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,320
l share my home with a fish,

221
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:55,639
some snails, whom l have named
after famous scientists...

222
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,240
(Bird squawks)
..a parakeet called Mr Biscuit

223
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:05,720
and, finally, a cat called Hal.

224
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:08,480
'Hal' is an abbreviation for halitosis,
from which he su_ers.

225
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:14,920
He followed me home
after a gang of children

226
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:17,359
shot his eye out with a beebee gun.

227
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,400
(Miaows meekly)

228
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:20,599
Do you have a pet kangaroo?

229
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,240
When l was born, my father
Ieft my mother and me on a kibbutz.

230
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:27,279
She shot herself with my uncle's gun
when l was six.

231
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:30,599
(Gunshot)

232
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:32,519
Do you like chocolate hotdogs?

233
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:34,279
l invented the recipe for them
and can send it to you.

234
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,200
When l was young, l invented
an invisible friend called Mr Ravioli.

235
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:45,359
My psychiatrist says
l don't need him anymore

236
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,040
so he iust sits in the corner and reads.

237
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,400
(TrafFic noise)

238
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,119
Last week l picked up
12$ cigarette butts.

239
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:01,839
People are always littering in New York.

240
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:04,880
l do not understand
why people break laws.

241
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Butts are bad
because they wash out to sea

242
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:12,559
and fish smoke them
and become nicotine dependent.

243
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:17,680
l am iust ioking because, of course,

244
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:21,079
it is impossible for a cigarette
to remain lit underwater.

245
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,400
Also, fish do not have pockets
to keep cigarette lighters in.

246
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
(Max farts)

247
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,240
l am 44 years old

248
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:37,359
and have $ tracksuits
the same colour and size.

249
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:40,839
(Scales rattle)

250
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:44,039

251
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Ooooh!

252
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,880
..and am as tall as a 6-foot tree.

253
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:51,039
(M: Welcome to the New York Lottery!

254

l enioy entering the lottey

255
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,160
and have chosen the same numbers
for 9 years.

256
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:58,759
Those numbers are 3...

262
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
(Applause on TV, Max sighs)

263
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Are you a winner?

264
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,800
Or a loser?

265
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:16,880
l have had many di_erent iobs
during my life.

266
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:20,079
My first iob was collecting
subway tokens in the subway.

267
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:25,839
My second iob was at Yiddel's
Gourmet Kosher Supplies

268
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,200
where l worked at the machine that made
pre-packaged noodle kugels.

269
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:33,720
l was born Jewish
and used to believe in God

270
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,880
but l've since read many books

271
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:38,960
that have proven God
is just a figment of my imagination.

272
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:43,359
People like to believe in God because
it answers complicated questions

273
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,119
like where did the universe come from,

274
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:50,559
do worms go to heaven...

275
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:51,759
do worms go to heaven...
(Squish)

276
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,280
..and why do old ladies have blue hair?

277
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:56,359
Even though l'm an atheist,

278
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:58,119
l still wear my yarmulke
as it keeps my brain warm.

279
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:02,519
My third iob was for a company
that printed logos on novelty items.

280
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,000
l worked at the frisbee printing machine.
(Machine creaks and squelches)

281
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:12,079
A frisbee is a circular plastic disc
that people throw at each other.

282
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,040
lt is like a boomerang

283
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,920
but it does not come back.

284
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,760
My fourth iob was when
l was called up for juy duty.

285
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:27,839
l didn't get paid much
but got free cookies and co_ee.

286
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,720
Jurors are outstanding members
of the community

287
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:36,799
who haven't murdered anybody.

288
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:39,519
l made it to the short list

289
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,520
for a trial where a man
killed all his friends

290
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:44,599
at his own surprise birthday party.

291
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:47,559
Unfortunately, l didn't get selected
because they found out

292
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,240
l'd been a mental patient at one point.

293
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:53,640
(Pop!)

294
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Have you ever been hang gliding?

295
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,480
My fifth iob was as a garbage collector.

296
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:01,039
l got to clean up after litterbugs
and didn't have to talk to anybody.

297
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Sometimes l used to pretend
l was an intergalactical robot.

298
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,240
(Makes robotic sounds)

299
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:20,279
(Operator3: This is 911.
Your call has been placed in a queue.

300
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:22,960
One time the police took me in
for questioning

301
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,000
but let me go when they decided
l wasn't a threat to anybody

302
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:29,559
except myself.

(Loud militay brass band)

304
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:33,720
The sixth iob l had
was forthe United States Army

305
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:39,279
in the stationey supply department.
(Sighs)

306
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:42,839
Because l am good with numbers

307
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:44,680
l had to work out how many
ballpoint pens the Army needed.

308
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:48,880
One day they did a security check

309
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:51,079
and asked whether l was a member
of any radical groups.

310
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:54,839
l told them l was a member of
the New York Science Fiction Fan Club.

311
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,160
They said this didn't count
but dismissed me anyway.

312
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:04,039
Fortunately, l did not remember
to tell them l was once a communist.

313
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,640
Have you ever been a communist?

314
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Have you ever been attacked by a crow
or similar large bird?

315
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:16,839
When l was 9, a crow attacked me
on my way to school.

316
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,920
(Max gasps, crow caws)

317
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:24,599
l had to have three stitches

318
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,080
and in spring l now wear a helmet
with eyes l have painted on.

319
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,160
People laugh at me
when l wear my helmet.

320
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:34,960
(Man laughs)
l'm not sure why.

321
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,200
People often confuse me
but l ty not to let them wory me.

322
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,200
(TrafFic noise)

323
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:44,319
New York is a vey busy
and noisy place.

324
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:47,559
l would prefer to live
somewhere much quieter

325
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,360
like the moon.

326
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,440
l don't like crowds, bright lights,
sudden noises or strong smells.

327
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,400
New York has all these

328
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:01,119
especially the smells.

329
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:02,880
(Max inhales)

330
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:04,079
l often wear nose and ear plugs
when l go outside.

331
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:07,599
lt helps keep me calm.

332
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:10,799
l find humans interesting but l have
trouble understanding them.

333
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,160
l think, however,
l will understand and trust you.

334
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:22,680
You appear vey happy and l think
you would smell like a shrimp

335
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:30,560
as l know Australia
has a lot of shrimps.

336
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:32,559
Can you speed-read?

337
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:34,279
l have taught myself to read
two pages at once -

338
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:37,559
one eyeball per page.

339
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:40,680
l have to go now

340
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,000
even though l have not told you
about my 7th job,

341
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:44,960
in a condom factoy.

342
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Write back soon.

343
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:49,359
Your American friend,
Max Jery Horowi_.

344
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:55,799
PS. Please find enclosed
a photo from one of those booths.

345
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:00,559
PPS. Thank you for the Chery Ripe

346
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:04,359
and l am glad you like chocolate
as much as l do.

347
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:07,799
l have never eaten
sweetened condensed milk

348
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:10,640
but l will ty some this week.

349
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,240
PPPS. l have never used a condom.

350
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,280
Gey gezunterheyt.

351
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:22,880
(Narrator): Max hoped
May would write again.

352
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:25,759
He'd always wanted a friend.

353
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:28,680
A friend that wasn't invisible,
a pet or rubber figurine.

354
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:35,359
He counted the stars and wondered
how many days, hours, minutes

355
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,680
it would take his letter
to reach Australia.

356
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,160
(Frantic orchestral music)

357
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,560
Vera was not impressed...

358
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:53,880
Aaaarrgh!

359
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:55,519
..not impressed at all.

360
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:58,880
This nutcase would not be her daughter's
penfriend, she thought.

361
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:04,680
There was enough ugliness in the world.

362
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:07,519
May would be home from school
in an hour -

363
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,160
enough time for another cup of tea
and a bit of cricket to soothe the nerves

364
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:14,880
and dissolve the memoy of Max's letter
from her pickled mind.

365
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,720
(Radio3: Yeah, he's out.
Unbelievable. 14. England 7r150.

366
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,440
(Truck whines and rumbles)

Hey, fellas, you got room
for one more bag?

370
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:01,319
Sure, Mrs Dinkle. Hop in! (Laughs3

We've got some other bags to pick up!

Ooh. Hmm.

377
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:31,680
May, is that all the rubbish?

378
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:34,039
Yep!

379
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:35,960

(Rippling piano and strings)

383
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,320
Even though Max's letter smelt
like fish heads and orange peel,

384
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,440
May drank his words
like a bowl of alphabet soup

385
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,400
and hadn't been this excited

386
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,800
since Grandpoppy Ralph
had found a coin up her nose.

387
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:10,880
She wrote back immediately

388
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,440
on some butchers' paper
she'd stolen from some chops.

389
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:16,880
(May): Dear Max,
l'm so excited you've wroted back.

390
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:20,799
l don't think my parents like you
so from now on

391
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:24,680
send stufF to my neighbour Len Hislop

392
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,760
at 26 Lamington Drive,
Mt Waverley.

393

He's old with no legs.

394

They got chew'd'ed o_
in World War Il

395
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:38,359
when some Japanese peoples
kept him in a cage above piranhas.

396
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,160
(Screams)

397
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,320
Piranhas are goldfish that have teeth.

398
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,000
He's scared of outside,
which is a disease called homophobia.

399

(Magpie warbles, Len gasps)

400
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:56,480
He's started giving me 50 cents a week
to get his mail.

401
00:27:59,960 --> 00:27:59,960
(Bagpipes play 'Scotland the Brave')

402
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:01,119
l'm saving to buy a castle in Scotland
and mary a man called Earl Grey.

403
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:07,759
Do you get 'The Noblets' in America?

404
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Well, my favourite Noblet
is Vanity Noblet.

405
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,000
He wants to be eveyone's friend,
even the boys'!

406
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:19,640
ln your letter, you said
you had no friends. (Munching).

407
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Well, neither do l.

408
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,080
A-ha!

409
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,960
Yesterday at school, Bernie ClifFord weed
on my spam sandwich

410
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:32,039
and called me 'poo face'
'cos of my birthmark.

411
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:36,039
l wish l could peel it ofF like a bandaid.

412
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:39,079
He also laughed
'cos l had no buttons.

413
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:42,319
Ethel pecked them ofF

414
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,400
and Mum couldn't thread a needle
'cos she'd been testing the shery

415
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,200
so she used pegs instead.

(Lonely cello solo)

417
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:59,680
When l got home, l climbed into
my secret place till dinnertime.

418
00:28:59,759 --> 00:28:59,759
The other kids also laugh at my haircut.

419
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Dad has to cut my hair
because mum says

420

real hairdressers
sell your hair to Chinamen

(Shears chomp)

423
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:12,079
My teacher, Mrs Pendergast,
says l should smile more.

424
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,680
l told my mum
and so she drawed a big smile on me.

425
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:23,599
l don't think Mrs Pendergast
likes me anymore.

Can you help me?

PSS. l've never been hang gliding
before or been a 'commune-ist'

432
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:55,039
but would love a frisbee
and your recipe for chocolate hotdogs.

433
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:00,079
PSSS. l'm sending you some
Australian chocolate, a pompom l made

434
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,240
and a cake called a lamington,
which l was meant to eat for lunch.

(Narrator): May's letter
triggered memories

441
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Max had buried deep down in his shoes.

Max's meltdown faded away
and an idea popped into his brain.

(Ting!)

452
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,600

453
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:32,680
thank you for your letter, chocolate bar,
Iamington and pompom.

454
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,400
The chocolate got crushed, so l blended
the bits with milk and icecream

455
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,160
and now l am drinking it right now.

(Slurps)

457
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:48,119
After much thought, l think l have
a solution to your teasing.

458
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,360
Tell Bernie Cli_ord
your birthmark is made of chocolate,

459
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:57,119
which means when you get to heaven

460
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,160
you will be in charge
of all the chocolate.

461
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:02,680
This of course is a lie -
l do not like lies -

462
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,040
but in this case
l think it will be of benefit.

463
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,119
l wish l could be in charge
of all the chocolate

464
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,360
but, of course, l cannot
because of my atheism. (Pop!).

465

My neighbour l_ is also an atheist.
(Water bubbles).

She doesn't talk much but makes me
vey good soup on Sunday nights.

She is partly blind

00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,240
and sometimes l find her hair
in my soup. Eeugh!

469
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:35,799
l do not tell her as Dr Bernard Hazelhof
says this would be (farts) impolite.

470
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Here is a list of what l eat
on the other nights.

471
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Mondays - Glicks Potato Knish,

472
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:48,759
Tuesdays - Yiddels Noodle Kugel,

473
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:51,759
Wednesdays -
Captain Salty's Fishstix,

474
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Thursdays - Yentls Cheezy Blintz

475
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,920
and Fridays - chicken nuggets.

476
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,000
On Saturday nights
l create my own recipes.

477
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Last week l invented
canned spaghetti hamburgers.

478
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:08,759
Recipes are like
mathematical equations.

479
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:12,039
Dr Bernard Hazelhof told me you should
never weigh more than your refrigerator

480
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:18,720
and to never eat
anything bigger than your head.

481
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,200
l once ate a watermelon
bigger than my head

482
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,120
but not all at once.

483
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Do you have
any weight loss suggestions?

484
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:33,880
My Overeaters Anonymous meetings
don't seem to be working

485
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:36,880
and iust make me tense.

486
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:39,880
(Groans anxiously)

487
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,440
(Slurps loudly)

488
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:46,119
lt would be good
if there was a 'Fat Faiy'.

489
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,960
(Snores)

490
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,520
She would be a bit like the Tooth Faiy
but would suck out your fat.

491
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,200
(Water bubbling)

492
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:00,279
lvy says she is only a 'little bit' blind
but l think she is vey blind.

493
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:09,480
She should get a cane
like other vision-impaired people.

494
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,400
She could make the end pointy
(Ching!)

495
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,280
and collect rubbish at the same time.

496
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,400
l think l will write a letter to the Mayor
and suggest this.

497
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:20,480
He will be vey impressed.

498
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:24,039
l_ says she doesn't need a cane
because she has a good sense of smell.

499
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:29,119
(l_ snifFs)

500
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:30,920
She says she could find me
with her eyes stapled shut.

501
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,240
She says l smell like liquorice
and old books.

502
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,480
(Crash!)

503
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:44,119
l think she smells like cough medicine
and urine.

504
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,400
l have never told her this

505
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,280
as Dr Bernard Hazelhof said
this would also be impolite.

506
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,360
(Lift bell dings, lift doors clank shut)

507
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,920
People often think
l am tactless and rude.

508
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,320
(Farts)

509
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:06,119
l cannot understand how
being honest can be...improper.

510
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Maybe this is why
l don't have any friends

511
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,520
of course except for you.

512
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:20,599
A real friend has been
one of my three goals in life.

513
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:23,800
(Bubbles pop, satisfied groan)

514
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,840
The other two are to own evey Noblet
and a lifetime supply of chocolate.

515
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:33,880
Dr Bernard Hazelhof says
it is good to have goals

516
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:38,199
but not stupid ones like mine.

517
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,360
l have now run out of things to tell you.

518
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Please, write soon.

519
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Your friend in America,
Max Jery Horowi_.

520
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:56,159
PS. Do not wory about not smiling.

521
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:00,440
My mouth hardly ever smiles

522
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:02,880
but it does not mean
l am not smiling inside my brain.

523
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:07,519
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

524
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:09,440
PPS. Please find enclosed a frisbee,

525
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:13,679
some Chocolate Pop Rocks,
which you should eat with cola,

526
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,640
and an illustration of a turtle
from one of my National Geographics.

527
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:28,000
PPPS. Did you know that turtles
can breathe through their anuses?

528
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,120
(Quirky strings)

529
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:32,199
Dear Max,

530
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000
when l told Bernie ClifFord

531
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:35,960
l'll be in charge of all the chocolate
in heaven and he wouldn't get any,

532
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:39,719
he cried.

533
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:41,079
(Wails)

534
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:42,719
l also hide'd some dog's poo
in his bit of the sandpit.

535
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,160
Your advice was great and
l've got a job delivering pamphlets

536
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:52,239
so l can save to come and see you.

537
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,320
l am sad to hearyou are fat.

538
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,560
Mum says l am fat too
and l'm growing up to be a heifer,

539
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:01,639
which l think is a type of cow.

540
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Maybe you should only eat things
beginning with the letter of each day.

541
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:09,599
On Mondays you could only eat

542
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,000
milkshakes, marshmallows
and...mustard.

543
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:17,519
Oooh!

544
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:19,079
(High rippling piano, pizzicato strings)

545
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:22,599
For my birthday, my Mum baked a cake
and Dad gave me a camera.

546
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,560
(Camera clicks)

547
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:28,679
l hope you like the photos l sent.

548
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:31,519
The first one is of Ethel,
who ate some tinsel.

549
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:34,840
The next one is one of myself

550
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,360
after l ate the Chocolate Pop Rocks
with the cola, like you said.

551
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Next is Len.

552
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,520
He's still tying hard not to be afraid of
outside and conquer his homophobia.

553
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:50,599
(Len screams, dog barks, pole clangs)

554
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:53,840
The next one is of dad in his shed,

555
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,400
and then one of the times
l covered mum

556
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:00,559
while she was asleep in her stickers
that help her stop smoking.

557
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:04,519
Next, when l got my slinky
caught in my hair.

558
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:08,719
Then one of the times Sonny
digged up his wife, Cher.

559
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:13,480
And, finally, a photo of my other
neighbour Damian Popodopolous.

560
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,000
He's a Greek and smells like
Iemon dishwashing liquid

561
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and his skin is smooth,
like the back of a spoon.

562
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:29,239
Mum says he's a wog and has a stutter
and can't even say his own surname.

563
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:35,199
(He stutters)

564
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:36,880
She says you have to hit him
on the back of the head

565
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,560
to get his words out.

566
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,440
P-P-P-P...Popodopolous.

567
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:43,519
l wish he was my boyfriend
and we can be in love and do sexing

568
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:50,400
like Katherine Ramsay told me
behind the bike shed.

569
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:50,880
She said it's when two people
go 'nuddy'

570
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:56,040
and rub on each other to make babies.
(Squeaking).

571
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:57,039
l told her she's a liar
and would go to hell and burn like toast

572
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:01,599
'cos babies really come
from beer glasses

573
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,520
and eggs laid by rabbits
and nuns and 'prosti-tubes'.

574
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:08,599
She said ladies get knocked up

575
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:10,559
and bake babies in their stomachs
for 2 years

576
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,200
till they spurt out their 'vag-eye-ners'
with blood and tinned spaghetti.

577
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,360
Have you got a girlfriend, Max,
or some wives?

578
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:21,480
Have you done sexing?

579
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Valentine's Day is soon

580
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:30,120
and l want to give Damian a present
so he can love me.

581
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:30,239
Can you explain love
and how l can be 'lover'd'?

582
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:33,239
(Max screams)

583
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440
(Narrator): Once again, May's letter
had triggered an anxiety attack.

584
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,240
(Heartbeat)

585
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,320
Max knew nothing about love.

586
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,360
lt was as foreign to him as scuba diving

587
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,080
and he'd had an appalling histoy
of getting it all wrong.

588
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:50,960
One Valentine's Day

589
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,560
he'd given Zelda Glutnik a gift
he was sure was appropriate.

590
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:01,680
(Zelda screams)

591
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:06,920
The only companion (Swallows)
that had ever warmed Max's bed

592
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,960
was his hot water bottle.

593
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:10,559
Romance and love

594
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,760
was a mysterious language
he'd given up on.

595
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:15,519
lf only May had asked
how a toaster works

596
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:18,599
or asked for an explanation
of the Chaos theoy.

597
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,280
lf only there was
a mathematical equation for love.

598
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,480
He kept eating and thinking.

599
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,120
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

600
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,880
(Kissing)

601
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:45,920
But love was not like Max's
Rubik's Cube. It could not be solved.

602
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:55,120
No matter how he analysed it,
the results were negative.

603
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:55,559
8eat it, creep!

604
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,320
He felt love but couldn't articulate it.

605
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,800
lts logic was as foreign to him as...
as a salad sandwich.

606
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,120
The stars made more sense.

607
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:13,800
(Sirens wail)

608
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:16,039
(Radio3: 12, have you responded
to the call? Over.

609
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:19,159
The anxiety and stress were too much.

610
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,240
The inscrutability of love finally won,
and Max's brain gave in.

611
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:37,119
He was diagnosed
with severe depression and obesity

612
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:45,880
and spent the next $ months
institutionalised and bedridden.

613
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:45,960
They marinated him
in a cocktail of drugs

614
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:52,600
and pe_ormed
the usual 'therapeutic' procedures.

615
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,480
(Electricity buues, Max gurgles)

616
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Meanwhile, May wondered and waited.

617
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,280
(Lonely cello and piano)

618
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,920
Maybe Max's typewriter
had run out of ink.

619
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,640
Maybe America had run out of ink.

620
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:12,520
Maybe his pets had eaten him.

621
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,000
Maybe it was her.

622
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,480
Was she too demanding,
too boring, too...ugly?

623
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,320
(Lonely cello and piano)

624
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,080
Filled with anger, confusion
and self-loathing,

625
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,800
May tried to erase
the memoy of her friend forever.

626
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,200
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

627
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,720
(Toilet flushes)

628
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,640
(Knock at door)

629
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,440
(Knocking gets louder)

630
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,520
(Groaning)

631
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,880
(Cat miaows meekly)

632
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:25,400
Max had recovered.

633
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,120
And life was balanced, safe
and symmetrical once again.

634
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:32,840
But May still lingered in his mind.
(Sighs).

635
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:37,159
Half of him wanted to write to her
immediately.

636
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:39,840
The other half didn't want to end up
a mental patient again.

637
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:44,159
At least there was always Mr Ravioli
to be friends with.

638
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:51,920
He was a much safer option.

639
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,680
He wondered what May was doing
right now.

640
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:57,599
But she was far from content

641
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,120
and struggled on by herself,
saving her money for a rainy day.

642
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,880
(Soprano, twinkling piano)

643
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Life went on as usual for Max

644
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:15,480
and even though he opted
for order and stability,

645
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,520
misfortune was never far away.

646
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,040
(Spluttering and cracking)

647
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:27,719
(Loud rushing noise)

648
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:29,320
(Silence)

649
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:31,920
(Loud rushing noise)

650
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,760
(Silence)

651
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:35,840
(Loud rushing noise)

652
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,360
(Silence)

653
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:47,240
(Loud crash)

654
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:50,639
Luckily, his manslaughter charges
were dismissed (Gavel taps)

655
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:54,480
because he was labelled
mentally deficient

656
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:57,320
and unlikely to have a motive
for killing a mime artist...

657
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,480
Oop.

658
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:04,040
..unlike most people.

659
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:05,800
From then on,
Max cooled himself difFerently

660
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:09,280
and things went back to normal

661
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:11,679
until after his 4$th birthday,
when his numbers finally came up.

662
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:17,400
(N announcer3: Welcome
to the New York Lottery

663
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:19,719
and these are tonight's
winning numbers -

664
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,840
3, 5,

665
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,000
6, 9,

666
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,440
11 and 12!

667
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,040
(Joyous choral and orchestral music)

668
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,840
(Light pings ofF, door slams closed)

669
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:16,480
Max was sensible
with his sudden wealth

670
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:18,360
and had bought a lifetime supply
of chocolate

671
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:21,480
and the complete Noblet collection.

672
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,760
(N plays 'The Noblets' theme music3

673
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,760
Two of his life goals had come true.

674
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:31,840
But he still had a lot of money

675
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:34,679
so decided to give it to l_...

676
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:38,240
(Cash register chings)

677
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,400
..who was also vey sensible...

678
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,160
(Comical '60s-style' music)

679
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:47,559
(Bones crack, she groans)

680
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,400
(Drill whines, hammering)

681
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:59,960
(Satisfied farting sounds)

682
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,920
(Engines backfire and splutter)

683
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,640
..until her own numbers came up.

684
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:25,880
l_ willed eveything
to the local cat shelter,

685
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:29,719
whose owner relocated
her kind donation to his bank account,

686
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:34,639
his wife's new breasts, a Ferrari
and enough fuel to get to Mexico.

687
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:40,880
(Engine revs)

688
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,480
(Musical horn)

689
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,400
Despite achieving all his life's goals,

690
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:52,239
Max still felt incomplete.
(Sighs).

691
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:56,559
Mr Ravioli iust wasn't
cutting the mustard anymore

692
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,920
and seemed more interested
in his self-help books.

693
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:05,039
May had given Max
a taste of real friendship

694
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,640
and there was iust no comparison.

695
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:12,280
She missed him too

696
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,160
but no longer saved to see him.
(Aah!).

697
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,080
(Coin clinks) She now saved
for a di_erent reason.

698
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,480
(Quiet, iazzy Russian folk music)

699
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,000
One day Mr Ravioli got up,
Ieft and never came back.

700
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,080
(Whistling, thud!)
(Hisses)

701
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:40,840
Max sought Dr HazelhoFs advice.

702
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,480
(Speaks incoherently)

703
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:45,559
He told Max that true friendship
is seen through the heart,

704
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:50,440
not through the eyes,

705
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:52,360
and that it was time he wrote to May
to reveal his true self, warts and all.

706
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:02,920
Max understood.
(Sighs)

707
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,320
(City sounds of roadworks
and pigeons)

708
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:19,639
(Max): Dear May Daisy Dinkle,

709
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,880
there is something l have to tell you

710
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,680
which will explain
why l have not written.

711
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:34,960
Each time l received one of your letters,
l had a severe anxiety attack.

712
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:35,039
This is because recently,
while l was in a mental institution,

713
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:39,519
they diagnosed that l have a new thing
called Asperger's syndrome,

714
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:46,159
which is a neurobiological,
pervasive, developmental disability.

715
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:53,199
l prefer 'Aspie' for short.

716
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:56,800
l will now list some of the traits
of an Aspie.

717
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,400
(Camera clicks)

718
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,000
No.1 - l find the world
vey confusing and chaotic

719
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:07,760
because my mind
is vey literal and logical.

720
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,960
(Train rattles)

721
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:22,200
2 - l have trouble understanding
the expressions on people's faces.

722
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:30,280
When l was younger, l made a book
to help me when l was confused.

723
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:31,599
(Slap!)

724
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:36,360
l still have trouble with some people.

725
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:36,480
l_ was hard to understand
because of her wrinkles

726
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:43,080
and because her eyebrows weren't real.

727
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:44,280
3 - l have bad handwriting,

728
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:46,599
am hypersensitive...
(Phone rings, Max gasps)

729
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:49,519
..clumsy

730
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,520
and can get vey concerned.
(Anxious murmuring)

731
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:06,400
4 - l like solving problems.
l_ said this is a good thing.

732
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:08,080
(Camera clicks)

733
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:08,880
And finally No.5 -
l have trouble expressing my emotions.

734
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Dr Bernard Hazelhof says
my brain is defective

735
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,000
but one day there will be a cure
for my disability.

736
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:24,480
l do not like it when he says this.

737
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:26,880
l do not feel disabled, defective
or l need to be cured.

738
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,640
l like being an Aspie.

739
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,800
lt would be like tying to change
the colour of my eyes.

740
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:40,559
There is one thing
l wish l could change, however.

741
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:44,519
(Toilet flushes)

742
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:46,159
l wish l could cy properly.

743
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:48,679
(He groans softly)

744
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:51,079
l squeeze and squeeze
but nothing...(he groans)...comes out.

745
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:56,239
l cy when l cut onions
but this does not count.

746
00:51:59,599 --> 00:51:59,599
Anyway, do you like the word
'cumquat'?

747
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:02,400
lt is a type of fruit.

748
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,160
Do you have
a favourite-sounding word?

749
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:07,239
My top 5 are ointment, bumblebee,

750
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Vladivostok, banana

751
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:16,120
and testicle.

752
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,760
l have also invented some new words -

753
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:28,960
'confuuled', which is being confused
and puzzled at the same time,

754
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,640
'snirt', which is a cross between
snow and dirt,

755
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:33,719
and 'smushables'...
(Grumbles)

756
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:36,039
..which are squashed groceries
you find at the bottom of the bag.

757
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:41,519
l have sent a letter
to the Oxford Dictionay people

758
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,360
asking them to include my words

759
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:51,840
but l have not heard back.

760
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:51,920
lt is now time for me to go
to my Overeaters Anonymous meeting.

761
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:56,159
There is a woman there
called Marjorie Buttersworth

762
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:01,960
who confuules me.

763
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:02,039
She kisses me without my permission

764
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:12,520
so tonight l have decided to rub onions
under my armpits to repel her.

765
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,440
Your friend in America,
Max Jery Horowi_.

766
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:21,800
PS. Please find enclosed

767
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:27,880
some chocolate-covered ants
l found at the deli.

768
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:29,079
PPS. Not much has happened
since l last wrote

769
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:39,440
except for my manslaughter charges,
Iotto win and l_'s death.

770
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:42,679
(Narrator): May was thrilled
Max had finally written

771
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:45,960
and suddenly had a fabulous idea.

772
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:50,560
A-ha! (Ting!3

773
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:58,480
(Rippling piano and strings)

774
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,520
(Lawnmower drones,
cat miaows)

775
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,800
(May cries)

776
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:22,960
May and Max's friendship
was resuscitated

777
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:26,760
and her tears were the best gift
he'd ever received.

778
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,960
lnside Max's head
his brain was smiling.

779
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:37,480
Loaded up with bizarre forms
of chocolate,

780
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,000
their letters flew thick and fast
between the continents.

781
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:44,360
Max learnt to read May's letters
with caution

782
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:51,560
and at the slightest tingle of tension,
he would stop,

783
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:55,280
take his medication
and soothe his nerves.

784
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:55,360
Each letter he would iron, laminate
and file in a special place,

785
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,160
which also soothed his nerves.

786
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,760
He enioyed answering her questions
and solving her puzzles like -

787
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:12,840
Do sheep shrink when it rains?

788
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:15,599
Why do old men
wear their pants so high?

789
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:19,519
Do gooses get goosebumps
and why is bellybutton lint blue?

790
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:24,679
Are there Noblets in heaven?

791
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:26,320
And if a taxi goes backwards,
does the driver owe you money?

792
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:30,920
ln turn, May simply enioyed
hearing about Max's fascinating life -

793
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:39,040
how many people
he'd counted littering...

794
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,240
(Whoosh! Thud!)

795
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,320
..how the latest Heny had died...

796
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,400
(Electric whisk whirrs in water)

797
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:53,519
(Toaster crackles)

798
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,880
..and new recipes he'd invented
for chicken.

799
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:02,320
Each nourished the other

800
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,320
and, as May grew taller,

801
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:07,119
Max grew wider -

802
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:14,640
their friendship becoming stronger
than the glue on May's Noblets.

803
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Although Max found solace in May,

804
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:21,599
he still found the rest of the world
bewildering.

805
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:24,840
And he couldn't understand

806
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:26,599
why he was seen as the odd one

807
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:32,440
while eveyone else
was considered normal.

808
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:34,239
Humans were endlessly illogical.

809
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:37,719
Why did they throw out food when
there were children starving in India?

810
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:42,880
Why did they clear the rainforests
when they needed the oxygen?

811
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:47,519
And why did they create bus timetables
when they never ran on time?

812
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:54,119
He agreed with his favourite physicist
that there are only two things infinite -

813
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:00,639
the universe and man's stupidity.

814
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:04,519
(Bicycle bell rings)

815
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:06,079
And for May, even though
Max filled her with confidence...

816
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:11,719
Bullseye!

817
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:12,679
..her world was far from pe_ect.

818
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:19,560
The grip of love had her by the throat.

819
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:26,440
(Giggles nervously)

820
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:29,199
(Sad rippling piano and brass)

821
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,320
(Screams)

822
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,680
(Thunder, rain pattering)

823
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:39,360
At 4.59pm, on the $th of the $th 19$$...

824
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:46,560
(Whistle blows)

825
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:46,639
..Noel Norman Dinkle
attached his last string

826
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:51,199
and, after 40 years
and 40 million tea bags, he retired.

827
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:57,320
To celebrate, Noel announced
he was retiring from taxidermy

828
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:02,239
and taking up metal detecting instead.

829
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,520
But, sadly, it was not a hobby
he had for long.

830
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,520
(Loud rumbling)

831
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,440
(Metal detector beeps)

832
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,600
(Melancholy cello and piano)

833
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:37,160
(May sobs quietly)

834
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,360
ln his will, Noel had left May
some money

835
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:53,560
so she decided to go to university
and study disorders of the mind,

836
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:53,639
yearning to learn more about her friend.

837
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:57,440
May was as popular at university
as she was at school.

838
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:03,320
Damian went there too,
aching to be a Thespian.

839
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:06,679
Hi there, M-M-Mary.

840
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:13,120
Hi...hello!

841
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:16,800
(They laugh)

842
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:22,079
(Damian3: That was damn f-f-funny!

843
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,680
(She sobs)

844
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,240
(Rippling piano and strings)

845
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:54,480
Hey, Damian,
your mum's roses look fab!

846
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:00,119
Oh, th-th-th-thanks, May.

847
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:02,599
Um, M-May,
can J tell you something?

848
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:05,039
Sure, babe!

849
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,880
Um, um, you've got d-d-d-d-dog's poo
on your shoe.

850
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,720
(May sobs)

851
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:23,559
(May): Dear Max,

852
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:25,480
l have been such an idiot.

853
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:27,400
l've wasted all my money
on something pointless

854
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,720
when l should have been saving
to see you.

855
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:33,599
l know love upsets you
so l won't go on about it.

856
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:36,679
All l want to say is that love
is obviously not for me.

857
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,000
l hope you are well and enioy
the chocolate cigarettes l've enclosed.

858
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,600
Love May.

859
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,760
(Swallows loudly)

860
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:00,719
Oh, you should be ashamed!

861
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,600
- Come on, baby. Let's go.
- Oh, Mum...

862
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:08,760
l told you never to talk to sbangers.

863
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:12,080
(Ting!)

864
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,240
(Dogs howl distantly,
Vera hums a tune)

865
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:17,320
(Narrator): Noel's sudden death
had filled Vera with remorse and guilt

866
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,840
and she coped
in the only way she knew.

867
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,160
(Vera hums a sad tune)

868
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:51,360
(Bottle smashes)

869
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:55,320
(Vera drinks)

870
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,640
(She coughs repeatedly and retches)

871
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,120
(Quiet, foreboding music)

872
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,520
('Zorba the Greek' plays softly)

873
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:58,880
(May): Dear Max,

874
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:00,440
our wedding day was eveything
l have ever dreamt,

875
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:03,920
making up for the terrible year l've had.

876
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,920
__

877
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Although all the guests
were Damian's family and friends,

878
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:13,720
l felt vey welcome.

879
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:17,239
Damian is so pe_ect.
He even made my wedding dress.

880
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:21,840
And for our honeymoon

881
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:26,480
he took me to Mykonos -
his favourite island in Greece.

882
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:26,599
l got to ride a donkey

883
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:28,239
and found the pe_ect gift for Len.

884
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:31,760
Poor Len, he's still struggling
with his agoraphobia.

885
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:35,719
(Horn beeps)

886
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:36,920
Aaaaahhhh!

887
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,400
(Tyres screech, car crashes)

888
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:43,480
Damian and l are so similar.

889
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:50,200
He even has his own penfriend, who lives
on a sheep farm in New Zealand.

890
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:52,920
(She giggles)

891
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:53,840
(Damian): May...M-M-M-May.

892
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,600
(Damian): May...M-M-M-May.
(Bed squeaks)

893
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:00,280
(May3: Ohhh.

894
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,560
May was bursting with self-esteem

895
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:05,639
and her confidence
was almost unbearable.

896
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:08,519
(She purrs seductively)

897
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:10,400
At university, she shone

898
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:18,200
and took it upon herself
to cure the world of mental illness.

899
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,320
(Rippling piano and strings)

900
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:24,400
She did her thesis
on Asperger's syndrome

901
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,640
and used Max as her case study.

902
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:31,760
Her professors
were thoroughly impressed

903
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:34,320
and her writing praised far and wide.

904
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:38,039
Soon, publishers queued
to print her unique insight

905
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:41,559
and by her 25th birthday, thousands
of copies were ready to be shipped.

906
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:48,880
(May): Dear Max,

907
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:50,639
l am vey proud to give you

908
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:52,199
the vey first copy of my book
about your disability

909
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:59,840
and the hopes that we have
to one day cure it.

910
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:00,760
Even more exciting

911
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,280
is that l am finally coming to meet and
celebrate with you in one week's time.

912
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:07,360
l'm also going to give you
half the royalties.

913
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:10,480
Your loving friend, May.

914
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:18,160
PS. Please find enclosed
some chocolate-coated Swiss almonds.

915
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:22,920
(Narrator): Max didn't take the news
vey well -

916
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:27,239
not vey well at all.

917
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:30,119
(Max): Dear May Daisy Dinkle,

918
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:32,880
l cannot express myself
vey clearly at this moment

919
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:38,039
and so l will list my emotions
in the order they feel most intense -

920
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:44,199
hurt, confuuledness, betrayal,
discomfort, distress and wheeziness.

921
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:51,519
This last one is not really an emotion

922
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:57,240
but l thought you should know about it
anyway.

923
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:05,199
(Max's heart beats loudly)

924
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,320
(He roars)

925
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,640
With her suitcase packed for New York,
May said goodbye to Damian.

926
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:32,719
She hadn't been this excited since
she'd found a Noblet in the gutter.

927
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:40,119
But her excitement
suddenly dribbled away

928
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,800
like a chocolate in the sun.

929
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:54,080
(Soprano sings sadly,
thunder rumbles)

930
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,280
(Singing intensifies)

931
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:32,960
(Violent shredding noises)

932
01:07:55,639 --> 01:08:00,120
May slowly sank
into a puddle of depression, self-loathing

933
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:00,239
and cooking shery.

934
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:02,440
The only colour left in her life
was her beloved Damian,

935
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:07,880
only an arm's length away
but as distant as the moon.

936
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:16,600

Ow!

is because you are not pe_ect.

l wanted to be anybody but myself.

Dr Bernard Hazelhof said
if l was on a desert island

1034
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:49,319
then l would have to get used
to my own company -

iust me and the coconuts.

1036
01:19:56,119 --> 01:20:02,360
He said l would have to accept myself,
my warts and all,

1037
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:02,439
and that we don't get to choose
our warts.

1038
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:08,760
They are a part of us
and we have to live with them.

1039
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:10,560
We can, however, choose our friends

1040

and l am glad l have chosen you.

Dr Bernard Hazelhof also said

1042
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:22,760
that eveyone's lives
are like a vey long sidewalk.

1043
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:27,079
Some are well paved.
Others, like mine,

1044
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:31,600
have cracks, banana skins
and cigarette butts.

1045
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:43,640
Your sidewalk is like mine
but probably not as many cracks.

1046
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:47,520
Hopefully, one day
our sidewalks will meet

1047

a can of condensed milk.
