1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,500
You know, after last year's corporate,
my wife was always encouraging me.

2
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,000
You know, she said: you did fine,
you did fine in the corporate.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,100
I was a bit nervous.

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,200
This little guy... hello. Sorry.

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,600
That's nice, eh? Nice background
with the people there...

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
- We are here at the... must I look..?
- Yeah, just look straight into the lens.

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,400
We are here at uh, MNU head office,

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,700
Department of Alien Affairs.
My name is Wikus Van De Merwe.

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,600
And behind me you can see
the Alien Affairs' workers.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,700
And what we do here
at this department is...

11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:10,200
we try to engage with the Prawn on
behalf of MNU and on behalf of humans.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,700
Not to everyone's surprise,
the ship didn't come to a stop

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,400
over Manhattan
or Washington or Chicago,

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,400
but instead it costed to a halt
directly over the city of Johannesburg.

15
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,300
The doors didn't open for 3 months.
It just hovered there. Nobody could get in.

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,200
And they eventually decided,
after much deliberation,

17
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,500
that the best thing to do would be
to physically cut their way in.

18
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,300
We were on the verge
of first contact.

19
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,300
The whole world was watching.

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,800
Expecting, I don't know...

21
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,000
...music from heaven
and bright shining lights.

22
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,100
Oh my God!

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,400
The creatures were
extremely malnourished,

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,900
they were very unhealthy,
they seemed to be aimless.

25
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,200
There was a lot of international
pressure on us at the time.

26
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,800
The entire world was
looking at Johannesburg,

27
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,100
so we had to do the right thing.

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,200
The government then established
an aid group that started to

29
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,600
ferry the aliens to a temporary camp
set up just beneath the ship.

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
We didn't have a plan.
There was a million of them.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,300
So, what was a temporary
holding zone soon became fenced,

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
became militarized. And before
we knew it, it was a slum.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,300
But the truth is, nobody really
knew what this place was.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
There's a lot of secrets
in District 9.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,100
At first, a lot of attention
was given to...

36
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,600
giving the aliens a proper status
and protection.

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,900
They're spending so much money
to keep them here.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,100
When they could be spending it
on other things, but...

39
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,200
...at least they're keeping them
separate from us.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,700
l want to be realistic with everyone.
The aliens will not be able to go home.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,600
The aliens are here to stay.

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,400
There were literally thousands
of different theories

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,500
as to why the ship seemed inoperable,
and what was speculated was that

44
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,800
the command module had detached
itself from the main ship,

45
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,300
and then somehow
mysteriously became lost.

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,800
Did it fall by itself or was it
programmed? I don't know.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,900
Examination of the
old video footage

48
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,100
shows very clearly
that a piece falls from the ship.

49
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,700
We look for it.
We look everywhere.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,400
This piece that's falling
caused us bloody problems.

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,900
More energy weapon caches found.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,800
The Special task force
conducted raids in District 9.

53
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,400
Where there's a weapon, there's crime.
Tensions rose, and rose.

54
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,300
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.

55
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
Residents in Tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night

56
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,700
in an attempt to remove
all the aliens from their township.

57
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
I think they must fix that ship
and they must go.

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,100
A virus, a selective virus.
Release it near the aliens.

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
They must just go.
I don't know where, just go.

60
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,200
If they was from another country
we might understand.

61
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,200
But they are not
even from this planet.

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,000
The government have enforced
a nationwide curfew.

63
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,300
The aliens, prawns,
they take my wife away.

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,100
The derogatory term Prawn is used
for the alien, and obviously it implies

65
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,200
something that is a bottom feeder,
that scavenges the leftovers.

66
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,700
I mean, you can't say
they don't look like that.

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,100
That's what they look like, right?
They look like prawns.

68
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,700
The aliens made off with an undisclosed
amount of cash. One bystander was hurt.

69
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,200
What for an alien might be seen
as something recreational,

70
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,500
setting fire to a truck,
derailing a train,

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
is for us obviously
an extremely destructive act.

72
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,600
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,300
They take whatever you have on you.
Your cell phone or anything.

74
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,200
After that they kill you.

75
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,000
And now, after 20 years, public
pressure had forced the government

76
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,900
to shift the aliens
out of Johannesburg.

77
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,000
They had had enough and they
wanted District 9 to be moved,

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,300
and more intensively
policed and controlled.

79
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,200
So, to enforce this mass eviction,
the government turned to MNU.

80
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,700
Welcome all
and thank you for coming.

81
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,700
Please listen very closely
to this briefing.

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,700
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.

83
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,600
This is the largest operation
that MNU has ever undertaken,

84
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,800
and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,200
It is to move 1.8 million prawns

86
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,100
from their present home in District 9
to a safer and better location

87
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,100
200 kilometers outside of
Johannesburg City.

88
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,200
We built a nice new facility
where the prawn can go,

89
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,200
he can be comfortable,
he can stay there...

90
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,200
The people of Johannesburg and
of South Africa are going to live

91
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,600
happily and safely, knowing that
that prawn is very far away.

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,900
UIO protocol dictates
that we give the aliens

93
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,700
24 hours notice
of our right to evict.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,500
Today, you will serve these notices
getting the aliens to sign I-27 form.

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,500
The legality that MNU is using to evict
the aliens is simply a whitewash.

96
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,500
I'm going to appoint a field officer
to take direct command.

97
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,300
Wikus Van De Merwe.

98
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,900
Everybody always said that
Wikus was not a very smart boy,

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,600
but he was a wonderful son.
That was my Wikus, just...

100
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Feels like life on the big stage.
Thank you Piet... Mr Smith.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,300
l had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to Wikus.

102
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,500
That didn't affect my decision
to promote him.

103
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,300
It's almost as big as my wedding day.
You know... not as big.

104
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,200
Wikus was always making me things.

105
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,300
He said that way
they just mean so much more.

106
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,500
He left this paper-mache bowl
on the sofa one day

107
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,800
and I didn't see it and I sat down,
and I... kinda squashed it.

108
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,200
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation, and...

109
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,400
I made them bring it all back.

110
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,500
Hey, congratulations, man!
-Thanks, man.

111
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, we're gonna go to District.
-Wikus! -How is it going, man?

112
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,900
Here's the shake.
B9 for you. -Thanks.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,800
I'm not saying
what he did was right, but...

114
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,800
he took the choices
that were given to him.

115
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,700
This is Trent.
Fundiswa, Trent. -Hi.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,900
Fundiswa is the guy that
I've selected to replace me.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,900
If he can make it today, eh?
-I'll make it.

118
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,100
I just want everyone
watching this right now

119
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,800
to learn from what has happened.
-You would think...

120
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,700
things like this would happen
to somebody else, not to me.

121
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,900
How is it going, man? Long time,
mate. Have you got my stuff?

122
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,000
Hey, boss! -How is it going?
-I'm all right, boss.

123
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,700
Good, good, this is Fundiswa.
He is driving with us today.

124
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,700
I think I was disgusted with
the way he worked.

125
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
There was always just a hint
of something not quite kosher

126
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,700
with mr Van De Merwe.
-Nobody saw it coming at all.

127
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,500
None of us had any idea
of what he was doing.

128
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,200
l think it is a great
thing to see that...

129
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,500
it's not the military guys
in charge this time.

130
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,800
Not to say that Koobus
and his cowboys are not wanted.

131
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
You guys are always wanted.

132
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,900
You see now,
these are the cowboys.

133
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,300
They shoot first, and then
they answer the questions.

134
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,900
Sorry, is this above the allocated
amount of ammunition?

135
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,100
Because I see your
pouches are full but...

136
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
I think maybe you should
speak to the colonel.

137
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,300
F.A.G. over here says that
we got too much ammunition.

138
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,100
No, all I'm saying, Koobus,
is that, you know...

139
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,200
you should find ways of making
you guys more efficient...

140
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,500
Listen to me, you fuck!

141
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Get him outta my face.

142
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,200
There are rules, we're all living
by rules in this world.

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,700
Well, l don't think he can
be forgiven for what he did,

144
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,900
cause it's like a betrayal.
-I've gotta get going, Les.

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think we're gonna have to cut
this interview, cause we're gonna go...

146
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,000
12 KILOMETERS FROM DISTRICT 9

147
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Take your magazines, people.
Come on, lets go.

148
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,800
The Prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,600
So, we have to come there and say:
listen, this is our land.

150
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,400
Please, will you go?

151
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,000
It's difficult to put
the vest on by yourself.

152
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Thomas, can you help me?
-All right, boss.

153
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
They told me I was gonna
get the vest inside the Casper.

154
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,800
Thomas, just look on the side
if there's a vest there?

155
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,100
I'm just concerned about my family.
-Don't worry about the vest, it'll be fine.

156
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Rights groups have demanded
that mercenaries should comply

157
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
with all UIO regulations
in District 9.

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,200
We're coming to you
from the entrance of District 9

159
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,100
as today, Multi National United
sets out to relocate

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
approximately 1.8 million
alien residents from their homes.

161
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Human rights groups are
keeping a watchful eye,

162
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
as many suspect
abuses might occur.

163
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,000
We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces

164
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,600
being deployed into District 9.

165
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,900
Backed up by
significant air support.

166
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,000
We'll go shack to shack
and get them to sign the form.

167
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,900
First one E.X. triple 7.

168
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,800
We're seeing the convoy stop.
The operation is about to begin.

169
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,900
Just stay focused.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,200
Are you ready, Thomas?
-Yeah. -Okay.

171
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,600
Is that a signal?
Okay, fellows.

172
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,900
You stay behind us.
Good luck, boy.

173
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Stay low! Where is he going?
What is it?

174
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
It's clear that security is very high.

175
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,300
This is only the beginning
of a total clamp down.

176
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,100
This is MNU agents.
Open the door please! -Open up!

177
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,400
Hello! Hello, hello...

178
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,100
This is Wikus Van De Merwe
from MNU.

179
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,600
We are here to serve you
an eviction notice.

180
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,500
You just put your scrawl there.
-Fuck off!

181
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,900
All right! Thomas, hold it!
We've got his scrawl there.

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,400
Because as he hit it,
it counts as a scrawl.

183
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,400
First time we come in,
there will always be a little bit

184
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,100
of tension happening
between us and them.

185
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,800
Hey, you can't eat that, man!

186
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,100
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
To him it's like a marshmallow.

187
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,500
No, no! Guard!
Don't confront him like that!

188
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,000
Did you see that?
Right in the roost. Stay calm!

189
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,700
This is gonna be a problem cause
now all prawns are coming out,

190
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,600
they wanna see what's going on.
Stop it! Stop it!

191
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,400
Bring my kit.
See, everybody is gathering now.

192
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,300
Don't shoot or you're gonna
turn it into a warzone!

193
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
What is that? Is that a tear gas?
-No, it's cat food.

194
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,900
It is cat food.
I just distract them.

195
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,900
No it's not my house.
I don't live here.

196
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,100
Well, that's a pity because,
you know, this...

197
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,300
This is a nice cat food, you know.
But of course, it's not your house.

198
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
So, we'll just have to go and give it
to someone else. -Yes! It's my house!

199
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,800
We need you to sign here.
Now you can take that...

200
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,400
All right. Stop it!

201
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,900
The creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food.

202
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,400
Something about it, like catnip
for cats. Only a lot more intense.

203
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,300
Hello? MNU. We are here
to serve eviction notices.

204
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,000
What is eviction?

205
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,800
What we have stranded
on Earth in this colony,

206
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,100
is basically the workers that are
unable to think for themselves.

207
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,000
They will take commands,
they have no initiative.

208
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,500
They've lost all the
apt of leadership

209
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
through whatever cause.
We presume illness.

210
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,700
I'm holding steady over
Nigerian compound area.

211
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,200
Where there's a slum, there's crime.
And District 9 was no exception.

212
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,300
The nigerians had various scams going.
One of them was the cat food scam.

213
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,400
Where they sold cat food to
the aliens for exorbitant prices.

214
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,700
You put the money here first.
You don't get anything until you pay.

215
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,100
What are you trying to do?
I'll chop your balls off.

216
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,300
Not to mention
interspecies prostitution,

217
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,100
and they also dealt
in alien weaponry.

218
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,700
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there,

219
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,000
you can see that,
that's somebody's car in there.

220
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,500
The nigerians in District 9 are
headed by a man called Obesandjo.

221
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,900
He's a very powerful
underground figure in Johannesburg.

222
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
You don't want to play
with these boys.

223
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,400
They will cut you into pieces.

224
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,100
That's the boss there.
OK, no problem.

225
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,100
Don't look at him!
This is gonna cause problems.

226
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,100
All right, next. 766, all right.

227
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,600
MNU agents.
Open the door please!

228
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,900
Whoa! Jesus! What is it?

229
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,800
Check the other side!

230
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,200
Control, this is Wikus Van De Merwe.

231
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,300
I need a population control team
at JV 766 immediately, please.

232
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,100
Check the other side, Thomas!
There is 40 to 50 eggs in here.

233
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,400
Is this normal?
-This is an amazing find.

234
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,700
l can just show you
a little bit how it works.

235
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,900
Basically, a cow is hung from
the ceiling, you can see here.

236
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Very little of it left, of course,
because all these pipes

237
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
supply the nutrition
to the little prawn eggs.

238
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,100
You can do one, I can show you,
want to see? -No, I'm fine.

239
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,800
There we go. Okay,
no more nutrition to the guy.

240
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,700
Then finally we take air back.

241
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,800
The little guy is gone
to a nice little sleep now.

242
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,400
You pop him out, there we go.
Pop him out here.

243
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,600
You can take that. You wanna keep it
as a souvenir of your first abortion.

244
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,900
You can feel like you did
one of these here. -Thanks, boss.

245
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,800
Okay, here it comes, guys.
This is the snake.

246
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,600
If we were going to abort
each egg one at the time,

247
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,200
it'd take a very long time.
So, this makes a lot of sense.

248
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,000
You hear that? That's a popping
sound that you're hearing.

249
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,200
It's almost like a popcorn.

250
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,900
What the egg does, it pops up.

251
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The little guy, what's left of him,
pops out there.

252
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,300
So that's the sound that
you're hearing with the popping.

253
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,600
You don't need that, man.
Only sissies wear that.

254
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,700
Been drinking a little bit here, eh?

255
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,900
What are you doing with this
television set, sir? What's this?

256
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Hey, smile for the cameras here.

257
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,100
That's a first day find.
-That's a big find.

258
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,100
You see this? Trent, look at this!
There's weapons all over here.

259
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,700
CK 5, 7572...

260
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Some of the guns are small

261
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,600
but if it shoot you,
it make a big mess.

262
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,000
MNU is trying to move the aliens
for humanitarian reasons.

263
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,300
But the real focus,
just as it has been

264
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,000
right from the beginning,
is weapons.

265
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,400
MNU is the second largest
weapons manufacturer in the world.

266
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien laser gun

267
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,400
and just be able to shoot,
but it didn't work like that.

268
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,200
Because, as we discovered,
their technology is actually

269
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,900
engineered in a biological manner
to interact exclusively with their DNA.

270
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,800
It just doesn't work with humans.
And it's as simple as that.

271
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
This is basically a guy,
and there's 3 humans here.

272
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,400
Basically trying to make
a warning, you know.

273
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,700
He's saying "I kill 3 humans,
watch out for me."

274
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,200
Hey, don't urinate on your
own bloody... get back, get back.

275
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,700
This is Wikus, requesting
First Battalion escort, please.

276
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,800
You want to talk to them
or you want to talk to me?

277
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,600
No, not them!

278
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,400
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah I know, he had a spade.

279
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,400
Look-I find some!

280
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,900
I tell you before... this is
human technology, it is useless.

281
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,300
Only our technology
contains the fluid.

282
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,300
This is not our technology?
-No, it's junk.

283
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Keep looking.

284
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,100
I find something.

285
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,100
Yes. This is what we need.

286
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,800
Good, little one.

287
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,300
Get down!

288
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,800
Careful... wait...

289
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,200
...there.

290
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,900
Why must it take so long?

291
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Because it is very difficult...

292
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,400
...so much can go wrong.

293
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,200
Twenty years of work.

294
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
Our plan is ready now?
-Quiet... listen...

295
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,300
...they are coming.

296
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,400
You must hide this.
They must not find it.

297
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,900
Answer the door and be polite.

298
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,500
No! You take it.

299
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,500
You see, this is the problem.
This is the gang sign.

300
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,200
You see this? So again,
looks like we have

301
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,700
more and more gang members.

302
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,400
Fundiswa, you just stay back.
You stay behind Thomas.

303
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,100
This place is swarming with MNU.
I will be searched.

304
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,200
I must get back to my son.
Don't make them angry - be polite!

305
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,900
MNU agents, open the door please.

306
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Hello? We would like you to...
-Nobody is here.

307
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,100
Okay, that's unexceptable.
That is totally unexceptable!

308
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Get out! Get out!
You stupid prawn!

309
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,600
-Get outside!
-C'mon! Move! Move!

310
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,900
On your knees!
-I'm gonna have a look.

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Just stay there!
Right there!

312
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,000
Sir, we have to serve you
an eviction notice.

313
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Do you understand it?
-No.

314
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,500
This is a classic kind of
gangsta shack, I can tell you.

315
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,400
We're gonna find weapons here.
Watch your head, don't hit the cows.

316
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Just checking for panels.
Ah, you hear that?

317
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,400
Yeah, it's hollow there.

318
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,700
See? Look at that!

319
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,600
I haven't see this type of setup.
It's almost like a...

320
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,500
chemistry type of a set.

321
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,800
It's gotta be something.

322
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,200
l don't know, this has got
the markings there of...

323
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,200
...so it is definitely alien.

324
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,100
But it's not a weapon.
But I don't trust it.

325
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,500
Are you all right?
Wikus, are you all right?

326
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Switch it off, please.
Just turn it off.

327
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,700
Are you gonna cut that part out,
Trent, where it sprays me?

328
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,000
-Yeah, don't worry.
-You cut that.

329
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,500
We just found
a dangerous object here.

330
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,200
It has a fuel in and I suspect it might
leak onto people or cause damage.

331
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,200
So we just check that in and we
take that down nicely to the lab.

332
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,600
It's not a weapon
but it's dangerous.

333
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,100
He's got weapons somewhere here,
my sense is telling me that.

334
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,900
Lets check the other side here.
Thomas! -Yes sir?

335
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,400
Thomas, keep the gun on him.
-OK, I got it sir!

336
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,600
Keep the gun on him, Thomas,
there's weapons here!

337
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,700
Oh, this is Christmas!
This is Christmas, my friends.

338
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,300
This is the biggest find
that I've ever seen.

339
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,700
Control, come in.
Wikus Van De Merwe,

340
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,600
requesting
First Reaction Battalion.

341
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Stand by, guys!

342
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,700
This gun I've never seen.
Have you seen this?

343
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,000
This is amazing! Look at this gun.
What gun is this?

344
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
This is absolutely amazing!

345
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,900
-What are you doing?
-I wanna show this to Thomas.

346
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But I thought you said
you can't handle it.

347
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
No, I am not handling it,
I'm just gonna show it.

348
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,200
I'm not gonna use it, man.
It doesn't even work with humans.

349
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,700
Thomas, look at this gun!

350
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,700
-That's not mine.
-You're a dealer, eh? -No.

351
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,800
You hear this, sir?
You see what's happening?

352
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,600
First Battalion, my friend.
You know what that means?

353
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,300
That means that your days
of flaunting the law are over.

354
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,700
Have a look, you see that?
What's that?

355
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,000
That's a firing team.

356
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
Come here!

357
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,300
Wikus! Are you all right?

358
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Where do you think
you're going, eh?

359
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,200
You don't run away
from the chopper. -No, no...

360
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,900
Where do you think you're going?
You wanna piss me off?

361
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,700
Koobus to base, come in!

362
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,500
I've got two people down.
MNU guard, MNU agent.

363
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,700
It's the Foxtrot Yankee
5-3-0... copy?

364
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,500
And we need a Med Evac ASAP.

365
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,500
No, that's fine, Koobus.
I don't need a Med Evac.

366
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,100
Wikus, you burned your arm,
you need to...

367
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,200
I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

368
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,600
Sir, I really think you must go to
a doctor, a hospital or something.

369
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,100
-No, no. -You should
just get it checked out.

370
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,500
I'll just have it treated
by the medics. Help me up.

371
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,200
Did you see how fast
that prawn was, Trent?

372
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,400
-Yeah, he was fast.
-He was fast, I promise you.

373
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Look, I fix it.
I make it work.

374
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,800
I told you not to touch that.

375
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
What is wrong?

376
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,700
Nothing. Go outside
and watch for humans.

377
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,900
Where is your friend?

378
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,400
He's gone.

379
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,800
Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm just a bit hot.

380
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Are you guys hot?
Are you hot, Trent? -No.

381
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,900
Yeah, if you can't stand the heat
get out of the kitchen.

382
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,900
Now you see how
their kids are living.

383
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,100
This is what I mean.
This is why they get grilled.

384
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,600
-The little ones.
-Yeah, that's why we abort.

385
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,300
Lets just shoot the little bastard.
-No, no, don't shoot it now.

386
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,000
MNU agents! Come out!

387
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,800
Hello, little guy.
MNU has sweets for you.

388
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,600
There you go, eat your sweety.

389
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,900
You know, eaty sweety.
Works like a charm every time.

390
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Oh fuck, man!

391
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,200
You almost poked my eye out
with the fokkin' lollypop.

392
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,000
I tried to be fokkin'
nice to you, man!

393
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,700
Is this your fokkin'
little brat here?

394
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Inside, go!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

395
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,500
Teach him some manners.
Thomas, get him out.

396
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,800
Come! Get down! I've had
enough of your stupid games.

397
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,500
What do you want?

398
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,100
We're from MNU.
-I know.

399
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,200
We require your scrawl
on this eviction notification.

400
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,300
-Why am I being evicted?
-Yes, it's an eviction notice.

401
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,800
Put your scrawl on the bottom.
See? There's your name at the top.

402
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,900
-Yes! -Christopher Johnson?
So, put your name in the bottom.

403
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,400
It says you must
give me 24 hours notice.

404
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,600
You're going to another place. A nice
new city built especially for prawns.

405
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,700
-A special place! -And we are not
even going to charge you, okay?

406
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,100
This isn't legal.
-Sign the fokkin' paper! -No!

407
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,500
This guy is obviously...
he's a little sharper.

408
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,600
So we are gonna
have to try something else.

409
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
All right. Hello... okay.

410
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,500
Seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?

411
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,000
So, you've got a little one there.

412
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,700
Do you have a licence
for that little one? -Yes.

413
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,400
There's a litter out here. This is
dangerous conditions for your child.

414
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,800
Article 75 says that because
your child is living in dangerous

415
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,700
conditions, I'm gonna take him
down to Child Services.

416
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm gonna go and have
a little chat with your son.

417
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,500
You keep away from my child!

418
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,800
Don't point your
fokkin' tentacles at me!

419
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
You said you want to stay?

420
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,800
Your boy is coming down with me
to Child Services.

421
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,900
He's gonna spend the rest
of his life in 1 by 1 meter box.

422
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,800
Hello, little guy!
It's the sweety man coming!

423
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,900
Fuck, look at this, Trent!
Fuck it!

424
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,900
Thomas, keep the gun on him.
He is definitely a criminal!

425
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,200
He's got a whole
computer shop here, man!

426
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,500
You know, this is amazing.
I mean, this is obviously...

427
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,100
you can see stolen computers now
that he's decorating his place with.

428
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,100
Definitely he doesn't have
the permit for this.

429
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Where is that fokkin' little brat?

430
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,600
Hello! It's the sweety man...

431
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,300
It's the sweety...
Hey, I've got this...

432
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,100
-Wikus!
-Trent, turn it off!

433
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,300
Are you okay, boss?
-Fuck off, man! Fuck off!

434
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,500
Shall I leave him?
-Just fuckin' leave him, yeah.

435
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,100
I'll see you tomorrow,
Christopher Johnson.

436
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,900
<i>When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite, but firm.</i>

437
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,400
<i>And always remember that
a smile is cheaper than a bullet.</i>

438
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Are you feeling better?
-What? -How are you feeling?

439
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,800
I'm fine, I'm alright.
I'm just a little bit dizzy.

440
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,800
Can you just pull up
there on the side?

441
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,600
I just want to get
something to eat here.

442
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,400
Are you sure you should
be having that?

443
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,700
After your whole puking episode?

444
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,400
I feel a lot better... I think
I just needed the fillings, you know.

445
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,700
Boss! Boss!

446
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,800
There's black stuff
coming out of your nose.

447
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Jesus!

448
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,300
It's a silver cylinder.
I can't find it.

449
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,900
We must find it.
It contains the fluid.

450
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
It's not here.

451
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,200
It has to be. Keep looking.

452
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,100
We trade for ten thousand cans.

453
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,100
Certain factions of nigerian gangs

454
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,700
want to try and extract
weaponry from District 9.

455
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,300
And have been trying to
for many many years.

456
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,200
Give them one hundred cans.
-Hundred. -One hundred!

457
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,900
Yes, yes, but we take them all now.

458
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,600
Alright, boys!
Get them the catfood - hurry up.

459
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,600
And they amassed
thousands of these weapons.

460
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,500
Without the ability to use them.

461
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,700
Fuck off! Go!
Hey friend, not you. You stay here.

462
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,200
-What do you want from me?
-I just want to talk.

463
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,700
Talk about what?

464
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,600
Stupid prawn.
They'll believe anything.

465
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,500
Muti is a South African word.

466
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,100
Today it's synonymous
with witchdoctory and magic.

467
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,600
You cut it here.
This is their heart.

468
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,300
Cures high blood
when you boil it,

469
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,400
cures sugar, diabetes,
all diseases.

470
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,200
The nigerians were consuming
alien body parts.

471
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,400
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power

472
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,400
to use alien weaponry.

473
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,200
You must eat them.

474
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And their power will live in you.

475
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,900
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man!

476
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,500
Oh, baby! -Hi baby, come in!
-I need to get to the toilet, quickly!

477
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,900
Why? What's the matter?

478
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,100
Baby, listen. I might have
crapped in my pants. -Surprise!

479
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,800
What's this for? -Your promotion.
-All right, my promotion!

480
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,700
Hello, dad. How is it going?
Hi mom. -Good to see you.

481
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,400
What a surprise, man!
-Congratulations. -Thanks.

482
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,400
Congratulations, boss.
-Thank you.

483
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,800
-Wikus, what happened?
-I had a small incident, baby.

484
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,300
I'm just gonna go to the toilet,
and then I'll talk to people, okay?

485
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,200
I need to talk to you. Come with me.
-Okay, but I just gotta...

486
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,700
Guys, can you give us
a moment, please?

487
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,200
What happened out there?

488
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,300
This prawn wouldn't listen to me,
one really unruly prawn...

489
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,800
and I just had to...
get him in my grasp.

490
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Listen to me, too many
aliens died out there today.

491
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,600
UIO is all over my backside.

492
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,100
Focus! you're not going to
fuck this up for me!

493
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,000
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can!

494
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,600
Hi there!
-Nice to see you again.

495
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,200
Does this mean he's in charge
of this new operation?

496
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
-Yes.
-That's nice.

497
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,800
Wikus! Baby are you okay?

498
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,100
Okay, let's cut some cake.

499
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,700
<i>Doctor Smith, please come
to room 405, doctor Smith.</i>

500
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,000
Is it badly infected?
-There's a lot of suppuration.

501
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Also you should know on my right hand
some fingernails were coming loose.

502
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,500
And I had a black fluid coming out
of my nose, and sort of a black vomit.

503
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,000
What is happening
to my arm, doctor?

504
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,300
What is this thing?

505
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Just breathe deeply.
Calm down. Stay calm.

506
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,700
Sir, please call my wife.

507
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,300
<i>Attention all medical containment
evacuate ward 11.</i>

508
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,600
Stop right there, madam.

509
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,700
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?

510
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,100
Let me through!

511
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,700
Wikus! Wikus!
Where are you taking him?

512
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,700
Okay, got him?
Are you ready? -Got him.

513
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,400
Doctor Fester! -Yes?
-I think you should see this.

514
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,700
I found it in his jacket.
You think this is alien?

515
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,000
It's freezing! Fuck!

516
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,700
16 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

517
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,800
Where is this?

518
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,400
What?

519
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,400
What are they doing
to these prawns?

520
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,900
Pain threshold, test one, DBX 7.

521
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,200
That's a strong pain reaction.
That means the nerves have fused.

522
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,900
I mean, it's almost
completely integrated.

523
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,300
Okay, do it.

524
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,500
B5. Testing AMR-B5.

525
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Clear the range.
Now, quickly!

526
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,200
Swing it around.

527
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,700
What are you doing?
-The door is locked.

528
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,800
Can you grip that?
-What is this?

529
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,500
-Put it through.
-Why are you doing this?

530
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,400
-Standby for fire. Standby.
-You want me to shoot that?

531
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,600
Stand back... and fire!

532
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,700
That's good!

533
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,000
It worked!

534
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,700
All right, thanks very much.

535
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,000
Do you know where my wife is?

536
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,100
Do you know if my wife
knows where I am, sir?

537
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Pull! Pull!

538
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,300
No sir, I will not pull.

539
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,800
What did you say about
your wife? Fuck your wife!

540
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,500
Pull! -I will not pull.

541
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,400
Fire!

542
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,100
B7. -I can pull it.
-He says he can pull it.

543
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,300
I said I could pull it!
You fuckin'...!

544
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,300
B21.

545
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,900
Move, hurry up. Move!

546
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,100
Right, we want him in the center
by the chain. -Get this off me.

547
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Come on! Time, time!

548
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,400
Leave that fucking prawn, man,
I will shoot at pig. I'll shoot, sir!

549
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,700
Listen, I'll shoot at pig again
for you. I'll pull the trigger.

550
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,300
But I'm not shooting at prawn,
you hear me? Untie the fucking gun.

551
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,100
B21 in human hand.
That's good. It worked.

552
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,000
Just untie the gun, sir.
-Stand by.

553
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,800
Listen, you can't use the real guy,
he didn't do anything to you.

554
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,100
I want to try this.
Everybody standing by.

555
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,200
Ready to go?
Three, two, one, go!

556
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Amazing!

557
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,700
All right!
I think that's all we need.

558
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,700
Gentlemen, we are
running out of time.

559
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,000
This is the key stage
in the metamorphosis.

560
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,600
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.

561
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,800
And a problem is,
as the infection spreads,

562
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,900
the transition becomes
permanent and less active.

563
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,800
He's going to turn
into one of them. A prawn!

564
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,000
What happens to him
isn't important.

565
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.

566
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,500
This body represents
hundreds of millions,

567
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,100
maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology.

568
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,700
There are people out there,
governments, corporations,

569
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,600
who'd kill for this chance.

570
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,300
Will he survive the procedure?
-No, of course not.

571
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,200
We need everything.
Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

572
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,200
The procedure is gonna basically
strip him down to nothing. -Please...

573
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,600
What about next of kin?

574
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,500
Please help me.
Don't let them do it.

575
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,000
I'll handle that.

576
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,700
Okay, I say let's go.
-Good, thank you.

577
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,000
I don't understand.

578
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,600
None of this makes any sense.
He just hurt his arm, dad.

579
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,200
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

580
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,400
Doing their best to save him.

581
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,600
We're starting to harvest
material from the specimen.

582
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,700
We'll start with the soft tissue first.
Cut through the chest cavern.

583
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,600
We need to get the heart out
as quickly as possible.

584
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,200
Once it set the sinuosity,
it just spread.

585
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,300
You know Wikus.
He never was very strong.

586
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,100
I'll go through the chest,
go straight into the heart.

587
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,400
Be quiet, please.
-Fuck you!

588
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,900
Can I see him?

589
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,200
Not a good idea.

590
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,600
Fuck off! Fuck you!

591
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,200
Fuck you!

592
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,600
You need to let go of him now.

593
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,700
It's okay, Tania.
Everything will be okay.

594
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
Smith.

595
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
When?

596
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,200
Get Koobus.

597
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,900
<i>...Wikus Van De Merwe.</i>

598
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,600
<i>White male, mid thirties.
Is considered highly dangerous.</i>

599
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,900
-Hey baby.
-Wikus, is that you?

600
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,400
-Mrs. Smith?
-How dare you phone us!

601
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,600
What are all these people doing in
my house? -It's none of your business.

602
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,800
I need to speak to Tania
straight away, please. It's my house.

603
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,100
This is my phone that you're
using, mam. I'm fokkin'... what?

604
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,600
He tried calling me.

605
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,700
Anton, it's me! It's me!
Accept the call!

606
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,600
I've been friends with you
for fokkin' 13 years, man!

607
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,500
Fuck off! What are you watching?
Fuck off!

608
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,800
We all thought it was for the best
because he needed help.

609
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,900
A special medical help.

610
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,800
And he wasn't gonna
get that as a fugitive.

611
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,500
He became the most valuable
business artifact on Earth.

612
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,700
He was the only human
who had ever...

613
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,000
successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive.

614
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:39,300
But his real value was that
he could operate alien weaponry.

615
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,000
Hello.

616
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,900
Can I get some cheese burgers
and one large sauerkraut, please.

617
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,800
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.</i>

618
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,700
<i>A patient has escaped from the
isolation ward and is loose in the city.</i>

619
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,800
<i>Wikus Van De Merwe
was recently apprehended</i>

620
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,300
<i>after prolonged sexual activity
with aliens in District 9.</i>

621
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,800
This is nonsense.
-I have to call my manager.

622
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,400
That is totally untrue.
You are legally obliged to serve me!

623
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
<i>...is causing bodily disfigurement.</i>

624
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,600

please. Don't listen to them!

625

<i>It's highly contagious

627
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,200

This hand is fine!

628
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,100
<i>If you have any information

00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,900
Stop!

631
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,900
31 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

632
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,300
Hi, this is Tania.
-And Wikus.

633
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,000
We can't come
to the phone right now.

634
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,500
Please leave a message. Bye.
-Bye bye.

635
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,400
<i>Control, there's no sign
of mr Van De Merwe.</i>

636
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,500
The entire world was watching him.

637
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,300
He was on every radio station,
every image on television,

638
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,500
anything you could find
had his face on it.

639
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,600
So he had nowhere else to go.
He ended up hiding in the one place

640
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,300
he knew no one would ever
come looking for him.

641
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,400
40 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

642
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,200
Pay now,or nothing.

643
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,000
I pay you next week, I promise.

644
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,200
No money - you get nothing.
Fucking prawn, this isn't charity.

645
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,500
Hello, I'd like to buy
some meat, please.

646
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,700
Hey, a man!

647
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,800
Yes, have you got a hamburger,
or a steak roll?

648
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,400
Does it look like
a hamburger shop?

649
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,900
Which one do you want? Goat?

650
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,800
Come on, come on,
I don't have the whole day.

651
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,300
Is that a cat food there?
-Yeah, yeah, it is.

652
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,900
I'll have some of that, guys.

653
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,100
Fuck, man!

654
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,800
Hello, hello?

655
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,900
Baby is that you? Tania?

656
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,300
God, please let it be you.

657
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,800
Yes, it's me.

658
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,700
I'm so happy you called me, baby.

659
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,300
Wikus, listen to me. -Okay.

660
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,100
I have something to say to you,
and it's not gonna be easy.

661
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,400
No, no, look... listen baby,
before you say anything...

662
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,300
Your father is working against me,
but he's lying to you.

663
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,600
I did not have sex
with one of these...

664
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,000
...fokkin' creatures, man!

665
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,500
I would never have any kind of

666
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,400
pornographic activity
with a fokkin' creature!

667
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:25,700
They say that you're becoming
one of them. I can't do this...

668
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,900
Baby please, don't give up on me.

669
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,400
Don't give up on me baby,
because I can...

670
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,300
I want to see you again, baby.

671
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,400
I'm gonna fix my arm
and I'm gonna see you again,

672
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,500
and I'm gonna kiss you
and I'm gonna hold you again.

673
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,800
I also want you
to hold me again.

674
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,100
Baby?

675
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,800
Baby?

676
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,700
Hey! Hey man!

677
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,100
Okay...

678
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,000
<i>We are on tracking
directly to the location.</i>

679
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,600
<i>Roger that. I'll send you a
couple of choppers for backup.</i>

680
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,900
You!

681
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,800
What do you want?

682
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,800
<i>Come in, control, there is
our target moving to 66.</i>

683
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,600
-You have to go.
-Please, I need your help.

684
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,900
We're gonna play hide and seek.
-Yes! Yes! -No, get back.

685
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,400
You want me to hide? Show me
your favorite hiding place.

686
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,700
Please, just go.
Leave us alone.

687
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,200
No, please, I need to hide.

688
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,200
They wanna kill me.

689
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,100
I just need to hide in here,
sir, for 5 minutes, okay?

690
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,600
What is this?
What are you doing here?

691
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,700
I remember you. -Nothing.
You must hide somewhere else.

692
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,200
Sir... please sir,
you have to help me.

693
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,200
I'm losing blood,
they're trying to kill me.

694
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,500
Only one thing that could
make that happen...

695
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,000
Quick! We have to hide him.

696
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,400
Now you... get down there.

697
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,500
Where's the fluid?
What did you do with it?

698
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,600
-Please!
-You took it...

699
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,700
I don't know what
you're talking about!

700
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,600
...I know you did.
I can see what's happening to you.

701
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,400
Tell me where it is.

702
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,000
Alright, alright.

703
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,600
Was it a black fluid
in a flask container?

704
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,100
Yes, that's it. Yes!

705
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,800
I confiscated it and
the guys at the lab took it.

706
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,900
It will be at the MNU.
MNU has it.

707
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,800
What is this?

708
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,300
-You ruined everything.
-Where is this?

709
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,800
Is that your shack?

710
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
This whole thing
is under your shack?

711
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,600
For 20 years you've...
this whole fokking' thing in here?

712
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,400
Jesus, this is very illegal.

713
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:08,300
I mean, this is a find, you know.
I wish they catch you with this.

714
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,700
Fuel goes in here.

715
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,300
That's enough! Quiet!

716
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,600
Then we fly away.

717
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,100
I said quiet!
We cannot trust him.

718
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,200
What is he saying about the fuel?
Are you trying to start this thing?

719
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,600
Are you little fuckers trying
to start this and get away?

720
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,600
Never mind.

721
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,000
Yeah, you sneaky fokkin' prawns.

722
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,900
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

723
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:39,900
What? What did you say...
about the fixing?

724
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,500
What do you mean
you could fix me?

725
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,600
Forget it.
It doesn't matter, it's too late.

726
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,900
No, listen! Listen.
Are you saying that you can...

727
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,600
turn this prawn hand
into a human hand?

728
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,000
You can make me human again?

729
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,200
We have medical machines on the
mothership that can fix you. Yes.

730
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,900
We can use this ship
to fly up there.

731
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,100
That's fantastic!
You guys are brilliant!

732
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,300
I always thought that prawns
were intelligent. Let's do it.

733
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,900
I don't have fluid.

734
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,600
I could fix you and I could fly away.
But I don't have fluid.

735
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Right, okay.

736
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,600
All right, I tell you what.
Why don't we...

737
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,700
go risk it some more?
Let's go collect some up.

738
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,700
It took twenty years
to collect that amount.

739
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,900
Fuck, man! Fuck!

740
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,900
Fuck! The only one that exists
is the one I confiscated?

741
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,800
Yes.

742
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,900
It's four stories underground.

743
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,700
Why does he keep looking at me
like that? -He likes you.

744
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,200
We are the same.

745
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,200
We're not the same.
We're not the fokkin' same.

746
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:09,600
There is a way out of this.
We get the fluid back from MNU.

747
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,400
Yeah, and what then?
Then we both die, eh?

748
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,400
Both of us dead.
That's a suicide mission, man.

749
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,900
Can you not fill my head
with that sort of nonsense?

750
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,200
The transformation is accelerating.

751
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,400
You don't have much time.

752
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,900
56 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

753
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,100
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

754
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,800
Hello.

755
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,900
-Wikus?
-Tania! Baby...

756
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,100
-Are you okay?
-Oh God! Thank God...

757
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,100
Where are you?

758
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,300
I'am...

759
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:07,300
It's not like my father said.
I know he was lying to protect me.

760
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,300
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

761
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,800
Baby I know, but listen to me.

762
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,200
It's all lies, I swear to you.
Everything he said to you is lies.

763
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,300
-I know.
-What? What?

764
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,400
I don't believe him, Wikus.
I just want you back.

765
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,400
I want everything back
the way it was.

766
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,600
That's... baby, that's what I want.

767
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,500
That's great!
That's great news.

768
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,800
I can make it the way it was.
If you take me back.

769
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,200
How? How can we go back?

770
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,200
I have a plan.
I know how to fix it.

771
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,700
I know how to fix myself.

772
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,900
And it will be me.
And we'll be back together.

773
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,500
-You promise me?
-I promise you, baby.

774
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,900
Don't give up on me, okay?

775
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,300
Because I haven't
given up on you. All right?

776
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,600
I won't.

777
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,900
-I love you.
-I love you too.

778
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,400
Tell me you got a fix on him.
-D9.

779
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,700
How many moons
does our planet have?

780
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,400
Seven.

781
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,900
This planet only has one.

782
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,700
I can't wait to see our planet.
It's bigger than this one, isn't it?

783
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,900
Enough.

784
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,200
We go home now?

785
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,100
Not home. No.

786
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,400
This is where we must go.

787
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,400
See that tent there?
That might be ours.

788
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,900
I want to go home!

789
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:14,000
We can't go home.
Not anymore.

790
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,500
Hi, you don't wanna go to the tents,
they are not better.

791
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,900
They're smaller than the shacks.

792
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,900
Actually, more like
a concentration camp.

793
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,100
If I can get you that black fluid,
what happens then?

794
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,000
We go up to the mothership.

795
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,200
And you can start that thing?
-Yes.

796
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,100
Okay, so just to be clear:
this is gonna go back...

797
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,600
This is gonna go back
to human like this.

798
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:54,400
I can go home
and then you can go home.

799
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,300
You can take your boy,
you can take all the prawns,

800
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,800
if I can get you that fluid, right?

801
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:04,800
You said it was a suicide mission.
Maybe you were right.

802
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,400
We have no weapons.
They'll shoot us on sight.

803
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,800
Look, look... Christopher...

804
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I know where we can get weapons.

805
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,300
Hi guys. Hello.

806
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,500
I would like to buy
some weapons, please.

807
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,600
How did you do this like that?

808
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,000
A doggie style with the demon.

809
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,200
I love it!

810
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:46,000
One brave white man, eh?
Were you wearing a condom?

811
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,900
I need to buy weapons, please.

812
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,600
You and I both know that there
are illegal weapons inside here.

813
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,200
I have money and I would like
to buy some of those...

814
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,700
Thank you sir for your time.
Thank you very much for seeing me.

815
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I would like to buy some weapons.

816
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,000
AK-47, some grenades...
maybe tear gas canisters.

817
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,400
I see you have limpet mines
here aswell, and I..

818
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,600
also see you guys have alien
weapons there, which is great!

819
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,600
If I could have one or two of those.

820
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,900
I have money, okay?
Now, I'm...

821
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,100
Sir! Please, sir!

822
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,500
I've heard about you.

823
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,700
Where do you have it?
Show me!

824
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,700
Oh, shit!

825
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,800
Come here. Come.

826
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,300
No, no... don't please!

827
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,900
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?

828
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,400
Shut up!

829
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,400
Forget the weapons!
Forget the weapons!

830
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:35,700
I want the arm. Cut it off.

831
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,100
What is he saying?

832
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,000
I'll show you.

833
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,900
Holy shit!

834
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,900
You tell them to stand down!

835
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,100
You tell them to be quiet!
To back off!

836
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,600
Tell them to put the fokkin'
weapons in the bag!

837
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,500
Give me the fokkin' weapons, man!

838
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,100
Don't you, sir, look at me.

839
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,500
I said don't fokkin' look at me!

840
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,200
How did you get that hand?

841
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,100
Fokkin' hurry up there!

842
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,400
Look at me when I fuckin' speak
to you. What is your secret?

843
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,300
What did you do? Tell me!

844
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,900
I want that fuckin' arm.
What the fuck did you do?

845
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,500
You fuckin' mazungo,
I'm coming for you!

846
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,200
I'm coming for you and
I'm gonna get you!

847
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:59,100
Drop your fokkin' knife.
Drop your fokkin' knife!

848
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:10,100
I know Layden,
he's useless to us there.

849
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,500
Would you relax?

850
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,600
For fuck's sakes, my men have
done this a hundred times before.

851
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,100
<i>Maintaining a visual
on the location.</i>

852
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,700
It's gonna be quick.

853
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,900
It's gonna be clean.

854
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,200
Best of all,
it's gonna be quiet.

855
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,800
Van De Merwe hasn't got a clue
what's coming his way.

856
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,200
It's empty!
-Where are they?

857
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,300
Target is gone.
The place is empty.

858
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,200
What do you mean, empty?
Where the fuck is he?

859
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,900
That little shithead has got
no idea what is coming his way.

860
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,500
I'm gonna find him.

861
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:06,300
There are the guards! At the gate!
Watch the guards at the gate, man!

862
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,400
Move! Get out!

863
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,600
They're going down.
Four stories down.

864
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,700
This is alien weaponry.
Give me a status report.

865
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,400
It's Van De Merwe.
He's on level four.

866
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,200
Switch to live, and
then we're taking him out.

867
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,200
Colonel, we weren't allowed
to use live ammunition.

868
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:39,000
They want him alive.

869
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,600
Stay here until I call you.
-I understand.

870
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,600
I need to get the door open.

871
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,400
No! I said stay until I call you!

872
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,200
Fuck!

873
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,900
I thought you said
not to kill them?

874
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,700
He shot at me!

875
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,000
Fuck! Get out!
Don't fuckin' look at me!

876
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,700
Get out!
Get the fuck out!

877
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,200
Get out!
Everybody get the fuck out!

878
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,100
Get out! Go!

879
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,100
Move the fuck out! Go!

880
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,400
What is this place?
-Don't worry about that.

881
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,800
What do they do in here?

882
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,700
Check these boxes.

883
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,500
Any type of a box that looks like
it can hold a tube. Just check it out!

884
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,000
These fuckers!

885
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,100
Go, go, go...

886
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Clear.

887
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,600
I got it! I got it!

888
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,700
Chris, I got it. Let's go!

889
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,000
Christopher!

890
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,900
Oh, fuck!

891
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:29,700
Listen... I promise you,
I didn't know they were doing this.

892
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,800
Until they brought me here
the other day,

893
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:36,000
I swear to you I did not know
they were doing this to you guys.

894
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,100
But Christopher...
look at me. Listen to me.

895
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,000
We need to leave now. Okay?

896
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,900
The whole of MNU
is gonna come down here.

897
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,600
He's going to destroy us.

898
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:52,300
We can do this, okay?
We're gonna get out of here...

899
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,400
Fire!

900
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,300
Move, move!

901
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,400
Shoot at the prawn!

902
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,700
Christopher!
What the fuck are you doing?

903
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,300
Think of your boy,
for fuck sake!

904
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

905
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,900
You're gonna get us killed!
-What do we do now?

906
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:48,400
I thought you had a way out?

907
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,900
I didn't say anything
about the way out.

908
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,300
I promised you that we'll get in.
We're in! -I have an idea.

909
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,400
-Where are you going?
-Follow me!

910
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,100
What are you doing?
-Making a bomb.

911
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,200
Let's go!

912
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,200
Quick! Get in!

913
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,200
Go! Drive!

914
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,800
Okay!

915
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,900
Okay, hold on!

916
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,800
Fuck!

917
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,100
Reports are coming in of explosion
in downtown Johannesburg.

918
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,700
Well, there was a terrorist attack,

919
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,200
but I can assure you that we
dealt with it. Everything is fine.

920
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,900
Droop it down!
Droop it down! Decline!

921
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,300
They are really
close to us now!

922
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,500
Shit!

923
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,300
Let's go, let's go!

924
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,600
Don't drop that fokkin' thing!

925
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,600
Come on, move!
Get down there!

926
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:38,100
Go down and initiate
the binary commands.

927
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,900
Set it down right now!

928
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,200
When we get up to the mothership,
how long is this gonna take?

929
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,800
-To do what?
-The fixing. To fix me.

930
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,700
It's going to take a bit
longer than I thought.

931
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,000
Okay, that's fine.
How long do you need?

932
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,300
Three years.

933
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,200
Sorry, just go slowly
with the clicks there,

934
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,700
it sounded like you said
"three years", like human years.

935
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:05,500
Yes. Three years.

936
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,600
What? Three fuckin' years?

937
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,500
I will fix you,

938
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,800
but first I must save my people.

939
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,300
The deal was:
you go home, I get fixed!

940
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,200
I will not let my people
be medical experiments!

941
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,400
I'm a fokkin' medical experiment!
You hear me, Christopher?

942
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,000
I'm a fokkin' medical
experiment, man!

943
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,900
I must go home and get help.

944
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,200
I must use all the fluid
to travel quickly.

945
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:39,400
I'll just stay here, Christopher?
I'll just stay here in this shit.

946
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,400
And I'll see you in three years time?
-I will come back. I promise.

947
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,500
Christopher!

948
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,900
Where the fuck is he?

949
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,400
Hey, you got Wikus
down there, my boy?

950
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,300
-Father?
-No, no, no.

951
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,400
Your daddy needs to stay here
to sort out a few things, alright?

952
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,500
We're gonna go. We're gonna
come back and fetch him, okay?

953
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,700
In here? -In there.
-Goes in here?

954
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,100
How the fuck do you
open this, prawn?

955
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,600
Father.

956
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,900
Show me, you fucker.
You want me to fuckin' kill you?

957
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,100
Is that what you fuckin' want, eh?

958
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,800
Right... let's think this over.

959
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,700
On!

960
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,900
Activate?

961
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,600
My teachers teach only:

962
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,200
One prawn, one bullet.

963
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,700
I can't believe
I get paid to do this.

964
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:29,000
I love watching you prawns die.

965
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,700
Fuck, man!

966
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,900
Father!

967
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,100
Get out! Get out!

968
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,300
This is remarkable.

969
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,400
It looks like something is
emerging from the ground.

970
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,600
Something is definitely
coming out of the ground.

971
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Okay... steady!

972
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,100
Go sit down,
I can't play with ya now.

973
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,900
Uncle Wikus is flying.

974
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,400
Bug off. Bug off!

975
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,400
Lock the weapon at target!

976
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,100
Fire when locked.

977
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,900
It seems to be drifting towards
the center of the territory.

978
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,700
We have a lock on him. -Fire!

979
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,700
Something is fired upon...
it has been hit!

980
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,300
What the fuck is that?

981
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,200
One of the engines is billowing
smoke, it's out of control.

982
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:59,100
It's going down, boss. Should I
send the boys to fuck him up?

983
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,400
Now... it hit the ground,
the massive impact,

984
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,500
and it's come to a standstill.

985
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,600
My son!
My son's in there!

986
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,700
Shut the fuck up!
Get this fucker inside.

987
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,100
We're moving out.
Come, let's go, let's go...

988
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,500
Move!

989
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,400
We're banking around now, trying
to get a better view of the ship

990
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:34,300
which is absolutely wrecked,
waiting for some of the smoke to clear.

991
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,700
Somebody has been
brought out of the vehicle.

992
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,000
It looks like a human being.

993
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,900
We are getting unconfirmed
reports that this might be

994
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,900
Wikus Van De Merwe, a fugitive
that has been on the run

995
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,400
from MNU for the past 3 days.

996
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:54,300
They are loading him into
a vehicle now, and heading off.

997
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:00,200
72 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

998
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,800
What the fuck?

999
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,900
Bring him to me.

1000
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,800
Come on! Get back!

1001
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,200
Oh, fuck!

1002
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:12,200
Control, we're taking enemy fire!
We need support. Backup, now!

1003
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,100
Fuck off! Fuck off, man!

1004
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,500
Get you hands off me!
Fuckin' get off me!

1005
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,900
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

1006
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,200
Didn't I tell you...
that I'm gonna get you?

1007
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,400
You came in here and you left
with something that belongs to me.

1008
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,800
Fuck you.

1009
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,700
Fuck you all!

1010
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:20,100
I told you that
the day will come.

1011
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,100
You've been running
around with my prize.

1012
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,300
All I want is to eat that hand
and become like you.

1013
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:31,200
No! It won't work...

1014
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,300
Once I have that power,
no one will stop me.

1015
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,000
It was your turn...
now it's mine!

1016
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,700
Fighting MNU security forces,
this armed faction is doomed...

1017
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:57,300
Now I'm gonna eat, my friend.

1018
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,500
We're getting reports claiming that
the alien device is activating...

1019
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:27,800
You see that prawn
back in the Casper? -Yeah.

1020
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:31,200
He knows what the fuck
is up with that ship.

1021
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:34,900
Get that fucker out
and get him talking, now.

1022
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:50,500
Three contractors are closing in
on the nigerian compound, and...

1023
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,400
Come, alien!

1024
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:08,500
What's your plan?

1025
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:34,300
How are you doing it?

1026
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,000
Who's moving that ship?

1027
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,900
All right, that's very clever.

1028
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:50,100
Wait for my command.
Make sure you fuckin' shoot to kill.

1029
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,600
Fuck! Move it! Move it!

1030
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,800
Bring that fucker down!

1031
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,100
Hold you fire! Hold your fire
and keep your positions!

1032
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,700
It's Van De Merwe.

1033
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,300
Hey, Dickus?!

1034
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,100
You may have the prawn.

1035
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,000
 OK?

1036
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,600
- Just let me fokkin' run.
 - Run Vickus!                   

1037
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,000
- You let me go!!
 - RUN!                  

1038
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,100
-You let me go!?

1039
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,300
And keep on running, you
fuckin' coward! RUN!!

1040
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:45,700
RUN!!!

1041
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:52,700
Get the air support up,
and get on his fuckin' tail, now!

1042
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:59,100
It's not gonna work, boss.
He's a tough one.

1043
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:02,700
He's not gonna talk.
-Then just fuckin' kill him.

1044
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,900
<i>He's not gonna talk.
-Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1045
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,600
Fuck!

1046
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,200
<i>He's a tough one.
He's not gonna talk.</i>

1047
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,500
<i>Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1048
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,100
Hey, c'mon. Get up!
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1049
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,800
-I can't... it's too far.
-It's not too fokkin' far. Get up!

1050
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,600
I'm gonna get you there.
I'm gonna get you to your boy!

1051
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:03,200
C'mon, stay behind me!

1052
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,300
Go back!

1053
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Run, run, run!

1054
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:30,700
Arriving at the location now.
We have a clearance to engage.

1055
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:34,300
Prawns are coming,
get down, get down!

1056
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:53,300
There is no other option.
Knock these fuckers off!

1057
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,300
Come to mommy, come...

1058
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,500
Fuck!

1059
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,900
Shit!

1060
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:14,100
Are you hurt?

1061
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,500
We can make it.
I was shot in the arm.

1062
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,700
We can make it, come on!

1063
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:39,200
Listen, you go ahead.
You can make it.

1064
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:43,200
I'm gonna just... hold them
off here, and I'll join you soon.

1065
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:47,000
No, we stick together.
I'm not leaving you here.

1066
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:50,300
Take your boy and go home.
You have to make it.

1067
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,400
Don't make me go through
all of this and not make it.

1068
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:56,700
Do you understand?
-I will come back for you.

1069
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:00,000
Go! Go now before
I change my mind! Go!

1070
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:03,200
Three years. I promise.

1071
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,500
I'm not fuckin' scared of you!

1072
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,300
Quit fuckin' with me!

1073
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,300
You want me?
You want me?

1074
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,400
Is that all you got?

1075
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,400
Is that all you fuckin' got?

1076
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,600
Some kind of quite extraordinary
light from the mothership.

1077
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,000
I've never seen anything like it.
It's a beam of light...

1078
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,300
Full scan. Okay.

1079
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,700
Fire!

1080
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,800
Get to the vehicle, now! Get going.
-Yes colonel. -Go, go, go!

1081
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,000
Fuck!

1082
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:10,600
Quit playing with me, Koobus!

1083
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:13,100
You fucker!

1084
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,800
Go, Chris, go.

1085
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,600
Go home.

1086
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:16,200
We go home now?

1087
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,300
Yes.

1088
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:29,400
74 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

1089
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:46,300
Unbelievable.

1090
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,300
Now I know why everybody
wants a piece of you.

1091
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:56,500
I can't wait for those
med boys to cut you up.

1092
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,800
But you know what?

1093
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:01,900
You're not gonna waste
any more of my time.

1094
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,600
You half-breed piece of shit!

1095
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,600
I'm gonna just fuckin'
kill you myself.

1096
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:21,300
Stay back, you fuck!
Stay back!

1097
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,400
Stay back!

1098
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:54,000
The people everywhere
across Johannesburg

1099
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:57,300
are flooding the streets and
pouring out of their offices

1100
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:01,600
and all eyes are pointed up towards
the sky on this momentous day.

1101
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:05,300
It's the first time, ladies and
gentlemen, in over two decades,

1102
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,600
that the mothership has shown
any sign of movement,

1103
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:11,500
and people are
tremendously excited.

1104
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,800
The city had come
to an absolute standstill.

1105
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:18,300
Everybody wants to know
what's going to happen next.

1106
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:22,100
There's no way of knowing whether
or not Christopher Johnson will return.

1107
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:24,400
We don't know if
he was simply escaping,

1108
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:27,100
whether he will
effect a rescue plan...

1109
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:31,300
...and, as the so called
free press says,

1110
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,400
whether or not he will come back
and declare a war on us.

1111
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:04,000
This is the last known footage
of Wikus Van De Merwe.

1112
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:09,100
And we can only speculate
as to what has happened to him.

1113
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:13,500
The more zany conspiracy
theories state that

1114
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:17,300
he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.

1115
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,500
Or by perhaps some
shady government agency

1116
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:23,400
and he's actually
being held in captivity.

1117
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26,400
If we knew where he was,
we would try and help him,

1118
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,700
and that is the most difficult part,
not knowing where he is.

1119
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,200
Wikus, sadly, is gone but
I'm the one who stays behind

1120
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:38,100
with all the questions.
I can't give the answers.

1121
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:42,600
He died in my mind a long
time ago. And that's that.

1122
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:47,100
Wikus Van Der Merwe is a name
that will become very widely known

1123
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:51,200
because of this pivotal role
that he played in this whole event.

1124
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:55,000
He was an honest man, and he didn't
deserve any of what happened to him.

1125
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:58,500
I mean, I know. I looked into a
computer system and I found stuff.

1126
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,900
I mean, the whole data
was there, you know?

1127
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,100
They didn't even do
a good job of hiding it.

1128
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,700
<i>Fundiswa Mhlanga is
currently awaiting trial</i>

1129
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,000
<i>for exposing MNU's illegal
genetic research program.</i>

1130
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,300
<i>District 9 was demolished</i>

1131
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:18,600
<i>after the alien resettlement
operation was completed.</i>

1132
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:22,000
<i>District 10 now houses 2.5 million
aliens and continues to grow...</i>

1133
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:26,500
You guys haven't seen a picture of
my wife. Let me show you my wife.

1134
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:29,100
She's my special angel.

1135
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:32,200
She even looks like an angel
with veil, you want to see that?

1136
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:35,100
Look, you see,
with the white veil over the...

1137
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:39,000
she even looks like an angel.
Everyone says that his wife is angel,

1138
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:42,300
but this is a real angel that you
see there, on the cameras.

1139
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,600
They won't put that
in the video, I don't think.

1140
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,900
I found this at my front door.

1141
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,800
As tho somebody had
just left it there.

1142
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:00,000
My friends say that
I should throw it away,

1143
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,500
cause it's just a piece of rubbish.

1144
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
That it couldn't possibly
come from him.

1145
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,600
I know it's true.

753
01:44:58,873 --> 01:45:23,873
