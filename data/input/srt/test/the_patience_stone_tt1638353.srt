1
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:50,293
Al-Qahhar

2
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:52,749
Al-Qahhar

3
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,999
Try to hold your breath.

4
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:16,666
Just once.

5
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:21,541
If you can breathe,
So you can hold your breath.

6
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,374
Hold it!

7
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,916
Do you hear me?

8
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,249
Not.

9
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:40,541
Nothing!

10
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:53,916
Mullah said that after two weeks
you can talk and hear.

11
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:55,791
Today

12
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,958
This is the sixteenth day.

13
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:01,958
Still nothing.

14
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,958
What can I do?

15
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,749
Pray from morning to night,

16
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,208
I can not stand it.

17
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,624
I must talk about
with Mullah.

18
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,083
Mom!

19
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,499
Mom!

20
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:17,749
I'm coming!

21
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,374
What do you want?

22
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,624
There are more than bananas.

23
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,124
We'll buy it.

24
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,749
Pissed.

25
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,666
I'll get the serum.

26
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,499
Agree?

27
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,624
Girls, come.

28
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,874
We're gonna get.

29
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,624
It happens, it happens!

30
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:41,708
Bibi!

31
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,208
Come on, let's go!

32
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,666
Bibi! The Water Bearer
has not yet happened?

33
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:58,874
Not.

34
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,916
Come on!

35
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:09,666
Quickly.

36
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,249
Here are your drugs.

37
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,208
You, my sister,
should pay me ...

38
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,249
The pharmacist refused.
We need money too.

39
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,666
We will do like last time.

40
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,999
With sweet-salty water.

41
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,041
You will hold two or three days.

42
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,708
I must go see my aunt.

43
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,499
Asking for money.

44
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,416
I go there, okay?

45
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,291
Why I ask permission!

46
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:35,791
Who is it?

47
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:40,833
What do you want?

48
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,791
I come to see my aunt.

49
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,541
Your aunt? She's gone.

50
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:45,999
Where?

51
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,458
- I do not know.
- Where?

52
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,083
I do not know.

53
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,291
My aunt is a party.

54
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,749
She had not warned me.

55
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,708
Nobody knows where.

56
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,333
I have nobody!

57
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:13,958
She does not know what happened to us.

58
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,484
What we will become!

59
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,083
What we will become!

60
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,624
Do not leave me alone.

61
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:36,208
Do not abandon me.

62
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,208
Your brothers are also parties.

63
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,708
With your mother.

64
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:51,874
Your brothers,
so proud to see you fight.

65
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:57,333
Your mother would have sacrificed
for a lock of your hair!

66
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,374
They are all gone
instead of supporting me.

67
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,208
The cowards!

68
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,291
They did not want to know
why you were injured.

69
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,583
They did not know that you fought

70
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,708
due to insult,

71
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,833
just because a man told you:

72
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:50,374
"I spit
in your mother's cunt! "

73
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,666
Someone in your camp!

74
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,374
You get insulted,

75
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:07,124
and you think you shot
in the neck.

76
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,416
A fight

77
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,208
so absurd!

78
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,666
They are all gone.

79
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,749
The cowards!

80
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:29,833
Come back!

81
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,624
Back to God's love.

82
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,374
My God, help him,

83
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,666
help him!

84
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,291
He fought so long
for you,

85
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,916
and thou forsake him like that!

86
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,166
Mullah will not come tonight.

87
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,083
He is afraid of stray bullets.

88
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,041
The water carrier, either.

89
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:14,291
I hope he is still alive.

90
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,749
Mom, it's dark.

91
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,458
I'm afraid.

92
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:29,999
I do, do not be afraid.

93
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,208
I'm here.

94
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,958
Mom, I'm thirsty.

95
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,958
Me too.

96
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,999
Mom too.

97
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:01,374
We're out of water.

98
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,958
Mom, you were talking to?

99
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,833
With your father.

100
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,208
Why Dad is angry?

101
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,666
But no,

102
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,499
it will be if we bother.

103
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:07,958
Who is it?

104
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:14,874
It's me, Mullah.

105
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:17,749
Hello, my sister.

106
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,791
I come to prayer.

107
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,124
- Not today.
- Why?

108
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,124
Since yesterday

109
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:24,833
I am unclean.

110
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,124
What?

111
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,291
Impure!

112
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,083
I have my period!

113
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,124
- And Eve also.
- Okay, okay.

114
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,249
It was a Tuesday, right?

115
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,791
A Tuesday?

116
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,083
Maybe ... possible.
I'll come back in 2 or 3 days.

117
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:44,208
If you want
your husband heal, pray.

118
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,874
God bless you.

119
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,749
Dad?

120
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:57,708
You sleep?

121
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,041
Remove it!

122
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,916
There's a fly!

123
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,708
Yuck! Removes it.

124
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,624
Dad, tell us a story.

125
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:16,166
But what do you do?

126
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,708
Out!

127
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:22,916
There is a fly
in the mouth of Dad!

128
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,791
What they did?

129
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,958
I hope
they did not hurt you.

130
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,041
Wait, I want to see something.

131
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,083
Not yet healed.

132
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,541
Whether it is long!

133
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,791
Do you feel anything?

134
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,291
It hurt you?

135
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,833
No,

136
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:16,791
it does not make you evil.

137
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:21,583
You do not suffer.

138
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:25,791
You do not suffer.

139
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:31,499
How is it possible to live
with a bullet in the neck?

140
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,999
It is you who are injured

141
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,999
and it is I who suffers.

142
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,958
Brothers,

143
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,249
the enemy will attack our homes.

144
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,708
Come to the mosque!

145
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:46,166
The venerable commander
will give you weapons

146
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:48,166
to protect your family

147
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:49,708
and your honor!

148
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,249
They have distributed weapons!

149
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,249
They will fight.

150
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,333
They are happy.

151
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:35,916
Arise, you'll be killed!

152
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,666
Come on, get up!

153
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,749
I do not know what to do with my brother.

154
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:29,583
He does not want to ask
his foot down.

155
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,791
For God's sake, be careful!

156
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:25,041
What did you do to him?
The poor!

157
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,458
Okay?

158
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,333
It's better here, right?

159
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,666
You see.

160
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,624
They are behind this wall.

161
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,249
The Water Bearer
is not yet past.

162
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:40,374
The war is still not over.

163
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,458
There will be retaliation tonight.

164
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,166
I can not leave you here.

165
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,083
It should get you to the cellar.

166
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,499
It is impossible.

167
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:02,499
Your head should not move.

168
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,583
If only a stray bullet
you could complete.

169
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,541
I'm going down.

170
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,791
I can not leave
the only girls.

171
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,208
Do not move!

172
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:43,166
Otherwise, I'm buggered!

173
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:46,916
Do you hear me?

174
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:50,416
- What he has in his mouth?
- I do not know!

175
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:52,624
Where is your weapon?

176
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:55,083
There are no weapons.

177
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,958
It was completed before us.

178
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,333
It does not need an alliance.

179
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,624
Dig into the other rooms.

180
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,041
Neither of the watch.

181
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,666
Come on! Come on!

182
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,416
Do you hear me?

183
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:27,124
We will cut your tongue?

184
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,291
I'm talking about!

185
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:35,874
You're dead?

186
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:43,374
Guys, where are you?

187
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,374
What do you do?

188
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,541
Look, he has a wife.

189
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,958
- I know.
- How? He spoke?

190
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,958
He took his ring!

191
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,541
We're going!

192
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,458
Where is his wife?

193
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,041
There is nobody at home.

194
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,291
I think I know.

195
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,291
- This is one of ours?
- I think so.

196
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,124
This is a good Muslim.

197
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:16,249
It was not bomb the whole neighborhood
for nothing!

198
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:17,583
Come on!

199
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:53,333
Mom ... you see?

200
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,624
But what is it?

201
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:57,708
Returns.

202
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,499
But what is it?

203
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,166
Your alliance?

204
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:12,666
Your watch?

205
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:15,499
Someone came?

206
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,333
Thieves?

207
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:24,624
They searched the house?

208
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,541
Bibi djan!

209
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:30,708
Bibi!

210
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,458
Have you seen someone enter
home?

211
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,208
O King of goodness!

212
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,833
It is time to return

213
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,499
O King of goodness!

214
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,333
I cry my loneliness

215
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:49,208
The king came.

216
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:52,374
He caressed me.

217
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:56,083
Do you have bread, my daughter?

218
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,833
I gave all my bread to the king.

219
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,291
But where are they?

220
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,958
- Your husband, your son?
- There they are.

221
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,749
In the house.

222
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:08,708
They are angry.
They talk to me.

223
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,708
To you, they will talk.

224
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,958
- Where are they?
- Come ...

225
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:14,583
Viewing!

226
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,666
My heart is impatient
of your absence ...

227
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,333
My daughter ...

228
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,916
the king caressed ...

229
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,499
I can not.

230
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:38,583
I can not stay here!

231
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:42,499
Come on, girls!

232
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,333
Prepare your business!

233
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:45,749
We're going!

234
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,708
We're going right away!

235
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,291
I have to find my aunt.

236
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:03,208
Go to hell!

237
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,541
- My doll!
- Stay there.

238
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:01,499
You again?

239
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:05,208
- I beg you, tell me.
- I've already answered you!

240
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,624
Tell it to me or I will not move from here.

241
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:10,874
I'm still here!

242
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:20,749
Thank you.

243
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:28,791
We go.

244
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,416
Standing!

245
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,749
Well, I'm going.

246
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,124
I back tomorrow.

247
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,583
You can go.

248
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,708
I was lucky.

249
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,499
Finally I found my aunt.

250
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,999
She lives north of the city.

251
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:24,749
I did a great deal
of his life.

252
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:27,958
You knew I was married?

253
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,708
Yes, it seems.

254
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:39,958
My parents married me
a very rich man,

255
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:41,333
but stupid.

256
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:48,208
Two years later, we realized
I was sterile.

257
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,333
I was useless.

258
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,874
My husband sent me
with his parents.

259
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,916
To become their servant.

260
00:29:58,084 --> 00:30:00,833
When my father knew
I was sterile,

261
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,083
he had fucked me every night.

262
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,374
One evening, I cracked,

263
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:07,541
I could not go.

264
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:12,499
With its own deck,

265
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,374
I had hidden under my bed

266
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:18,874
I cracked his skull.

267
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,124
He died on the spot.

268
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,541
I fled.

269
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:28,583
I did believe
I had killed myself.

270
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:30,833
I disappeared.

271
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:34,791
I left the children.

272
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,708
She gave me some money.

273
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:42,541
I think ...

274
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:46,416
that ...

275
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,291
I can do anything for you.

276
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:57,208
They say that our neighborhood
is the front line.

277
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,499
They will destroy everything here.

278
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,916
You knew that, right?

279
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,333
You knew very well.

280
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,416
But you did not tell me.

281
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,666
You knew.

282
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:21,208
His brothers also knew.

283
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:24,124
That is why
they are all gone.

284
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:27,083
You know why
they have not taken you?

285
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,833
Your husband was alive.

286
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:35,208
Because you were alive.

287
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,374
Si ..

288
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:41,958
you were dead,

289
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,291
one of your brothers have married me.

290
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,874
Maybe they wanted
your death.

291
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,999
They could fuck me ...

292
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:02,083
finally.

293
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:15,208
Your brothers have always wanted
Me.

294
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,833
Three years when you were absent,

295
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,124
when I washed,

296
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:29,499
they looked at me
through the window of steam.

297
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:32,041
I could hear them gasp.

298
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,333
They masturbated.

299
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,916
I do not know what I'm saying.

300
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:46,499
I'm sick.

301
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,874
For once, you listen to me.

302
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:13,166
You never listen to me.

303
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,124
We've been married ten years.

304
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:19,416
How long
we lived together?

305
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,374
Two years?

306
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,958
Three years?

307
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:29,916
You were never there.

308
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,124
Even marriage!

309
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,624
Like all heroes,
you were absent.

310
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:40,708
The engagement,

311
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,999
in your place, there was your picture.

312
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:50,708
I was proud.

313
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:55,624
Proud to be at seventeen,
the bride of a hero!

314
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,291
Your mother said:

315
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:02,749
"Victory is coming soon!

316
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,291
"My son will come back!

317
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:07,708
"Victorious!"

318
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:09,958
When she saw

319
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:12,749
that victory was still far

320
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:16,541
she probably said:

321
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,833
"Leave as long as a bride

322
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,458
"With his parents is dangerous.

323
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,291
"She must marry."

324
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,083
That's why you got married
with his dagger.

325
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:37,833
I married

326
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:41,249
with you,

327
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:43,958
without you.

328
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:48,249
In the meantime,
I had to sleep with your mother.

329
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:52,624
She watched over my virginity.

330
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:57,916
The day of your return from the front,

331
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:03,708
when I saw you
for the first time,

332
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:16,041
I remember well,

333
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,708
as if it was yesterday,

334
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:24,791
you were like today.

335
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,499
Not a word, not a look.

336
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,208
You sat next to me,

337
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,499
indifferent.

338
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:40,958
But I

339
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,791
I watched you on the sly.

340
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:50,041
I knew nothing of men,
husbands ...

341
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:53,958
I observed the lesser
of your actions.

342
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,666
But you,

343
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,208
you still thought the war.

344
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,874
I wonder
if you noticed me that day.

345
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:23,624
I must go.

346
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,541
I talked a lot.

347
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,958
I have to take care of the girls.

348
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,499
The only example of married life,
it was my parents.

349
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,124
What an example!

350
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:02,916
The only thing that interested
my father in life,

351
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:04,666
it was his quail,

352
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:06,791
its quail fighting.

353
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,416
I often saw him

354
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,958
kiss her quail,

355
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:14,499
but never my mother,

356
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:15,958
sisters,

357
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,208
me

358
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:18,833
ever.

359
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:21,791
He always sat cross-legged,

360
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:26,583
he took her hand in a quail
and raised the bottom of her stomach.

361
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,249
And with the other he caressed ...

362
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:31,041
for hours.

363
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,833
Even if there were visitors
he continued.

364
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,749
If he lost the fight, quail

365
00:38:02,084 --> 00:38:03,583
he was mad.

366
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:05,708
Once he returned,

367
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:09,458
he sought any pretext
to fight.

368
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:12,333
As if it was our fault.

369
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,166
He beat my mother,

370
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,708
my sisters.

371
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:19,583
I hated her quail.

372
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,291
, He was so proud.

373
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,833
It seemed
he lived for them.

374
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,666
I remember

375
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,083
I was nine or ten years,

376
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,249
it was very cold.

377
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:44,499
I saw my father

378
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:47,708
put one of his quail

379
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,208
in his pants.

380
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,749
Go away!

381
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,041
Long, I imagined

382
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:59,583
the men had a quail
between the legs.

383
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,333
One day, he had to win
lot of money for a fight.

384
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,291
Finally, I guess.

385
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,583
He had bought a quail

386
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,208
very expensive.

387
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,833
For weeks,
he has driven.

388
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,499
But he lost.

389
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,624
Finally, you are!

390
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,541
Hello. Can I?

391
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,041
- You brought your quail?
- Yes, I came up with.

392
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,874
Your quail on the lam!

393
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,874
That's it, you've lost!

394
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:50,416
Come on, give me the money!

395
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:54,208
He relied too big.

396
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:59,541
But he had no more money
to pay.

397
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,374
He then gave my older sister
to honor his bet.

398
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,333
My sister is a party of twelve
with a man of forty.

399
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,208
I was scared

400
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:28,874
the challenge to become a bet,
me too.

401
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,541
I was very scared.

402
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:37,458
Guess what I did.

403
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:42,083
A cat came to our garden.

404
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:45,666
One day

405
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:48,249
I pulled

406
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:50,041
quail from its cage,

407
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:52,458
I gave the cat.

408
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,583
He swept into a corner
to eat quietly.

409
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,708
I followed.

410
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,958
But the cat rebelled.

411
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:07,041
He scratched my face.

412
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,333
Here, there.

413
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:23,666
You never asked me
this scar.

414
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,458
Why am I telling you all this?

415
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:39,124
I never wanted
anyone to know,

416
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:40,916
not even my sisters,

417
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,624
not even my aunt.

418
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:47,416
It is because of you.

419
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:51,458
It is you who push me to speak.

420
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:55,333
You hear what I say.

421
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:57,541
I'm sure of it!

422
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:01,124
You just want me to talk,

423
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:04,458
I'm telling you all.

424
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,374
Go to hell!

425
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,749
Forgive me, my God.

426
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,791
Leave us.

427
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:13,874
What has happened?

428
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:18,583
Are you scared?

429
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:21,833
Fear?

430
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,416
No, I have a strange feeling.

431
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,749
I feel ...

432
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,374
A bad feeling?

433
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,958
An evil feeling?

434
00:43:37,667 --> 00:43:39,041
Evil?

435
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,124
Not.

436
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:46,833
Since he is sick

437
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,208
and I told him everything,

438
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:51,458
I feel ...

439
00:43:51,959 --> 00:43:53,541
issued.

440
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:00,374
It's weird, right?

441
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:05,041
What you say
reminds me of my childhood.

442
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:08,333
My father spoke of a stone.

443
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:11,124
On a magic stone and legendary.

444
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,916
He said: "If you find
this stone, and lay it before thee,

445
00:44:16,459 --> 00:44:19,249
"Talk to him about your suffering
of your secrets.

446
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:20,708
"The stone listens.

447
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,874
"Whatever you dare ever
tell others,

448
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,458
"You say to the stone.
You talk to him ...

449
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,916
"She listens to all your secrets.

450
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:33,374
"It means everything.

451
00:44:35,417 --> 00:44:36,708
"And one day,

452
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,458
"Stone broke.

453
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,416
"It falls to pieces.

454
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:43,541
"And that day, thou art loosed,

455
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:46,749
"Freed from all your pain."

456
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,041
What's her name?

457
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:52,583
The stone?

458
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,458
The stone of patience.

459
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:35,249
Yesterday, I wanted to give you.

460
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,583
I felt
you wanted it too.

461
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:43,124
This idea comforted me,

462
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,166
relieved me.

463
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:49,124
But this morning, I realized

464
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:52,249
it was not your death
which relieved me.

465
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,791
It was something else.

466
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:02,458
This is speaking,

467
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:07,333
talk with you,

468
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:16,749
reveal my secrets,

469
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:23,958
will reveal all my secrets.

470
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:28,041
You're still alive
only listen to me.

471
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:33,208
You live for three weeks
with a bullet in the neck.

472
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:36,416
You live to deliver me
of all my suffering,

473
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:42,291
all that I have on the heart
ten years of marriage.

474
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:45,749
For ten years!

475
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,499
You've aged so fast!

476
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:55,708
I never kissed you.

477
00:46:56,709 --> 00:46:58,041
Never.

478
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,083
And now ...

479
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:04,666
I can do anything
with you.

480
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:08,624
I can do anything.

481
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:33,249
I can talk to you all,

482
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,749
everything.

483
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:39,083
My stone of patience.

484
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,666
Do you remember the first night?

485
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:03,249
Without a word, you're thrown out on me,

486
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,291
excited ...

487
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,458
distraught.

488
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:15,666
Your mother

489
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,583
we watched.

490
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:25,083
She was dying to know
if a virgin was deflowered,

491
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:30,624
if it could
have a grand-son or not.

492
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:39,333
A few months later,

493
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,874
when she saw
I was not getting pregnant,

494
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,374
she started to moan,

495
00:48:48,084 --> 00:48:50,083
thinking that I was sterile.

496
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:53,958
Sterile!

497
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:03,333
At any time, she was looking for me.

498
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,833
She harassed me.

499
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:15,166
She pushed you
to take a second wife.

500
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:18,333
And you ...

501
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:27,708
You do not know what I had to do
that you keep me.

502
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:34,416
If you had known,
you would have killed me.

503
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,124
I did not want
you leave me.

504
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,249
If you had left me,

505
00:49:48,959 --> 00:49:51,291
everyone would have driven me

506
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:53,958
my father, my mother,

507
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:56,624
everyone.

508
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,499
I have so many things
to tell you.

509
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:09,708
Someone is in the yard!

510
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:33,499
They bury the neighbors
in their garden.

511
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:35,999
My sister?

512
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,458
Hello, my sister.

513
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,458
Hello.

514
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:52,916
Are you okay?

515
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:54,708
I'm alive.

516
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:56,333
How is your husband?

517
00:50:56,709 --> 00:50:57,874
He's alive.

518
00:50:58,709 --> 00:51:00,958
They will still run
rockets.

519
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:02,374
Do not go.

520
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:07,249
God bless you.

521
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:25,499
Tonight again,
they will bomb.

522
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:27,499
I have to go.

523
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:16,916
There militiamen everywhere.

524
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:20,166
They searched the houses.

525
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:25,791
If they find you,
they will finish you.

526
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:31,624
The basement is flooded.

527
00:52:57,584 --> 00:52:59,666
I will not let them kill you.

528
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:23,874
Your head!

529
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,166
Wait.

530
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,458
I will not let them kill you.

531
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,124
Between!

532
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:55,874
Sit!

533
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:06,275
Are you alone?

534
00:55:10,262 --> 00:55:11,291
Are you alone?

535
00:55:12,334 --> 00:55:13,166
Not.

536
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:17,791
God is with me.

537
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:27,916
And you there, it's me!

538
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:35,208
Between!

539
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,249
What's going on?

540
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:54,874
This ... SSEZ ... fire.

541
00:55:55,959 --> 00:55:56,749
What?

542
00:55:56,917 --> 00:55:59,624
This ... SSEZ ... fire.

543
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:00,874
Until when?

544
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:02,624
I ... I do not know.

545
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:06,458
Will guard,
we camp here tonight.

546
00:56:06,959 --> 00:56:08,874
- Go!
- Ci .. cigarette.

547
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,166
Here! Go!

548
00:56:25,209 --> 00:56:25,958
Go!

549
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,583
Alone,

550
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:31,958
you're not afraid?

551
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,416
You have one?

552
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:39,416
No, I am a widow.

553
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:43,166
Do you have children?

554
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:45,958
Yes.

555
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:47,874
Two daughters.

556
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:51,124
Where are they?

557
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:56,124
My aunt.

558
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:58,249
That only you doing here, then?

559
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,499
I ...

560
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:04,416
I work.

561
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:07,958
I have to earn my living,
I have two little girls to feed.

562
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,416
What is your job?

563
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:14,916
I sell my body.

564
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:17,083
What?

565
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:21,208
My body.

566
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,499
I sell my body.

567
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:24,749
I did not understand.

568
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:29,249
I sell my body ...
for the pleasure of men.

569
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:31,833
Shame on you,
shameless, debauched.

570
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:34,541
- You have no shame?
- What?

571
00:57:34,709 --> 00:57:37,124
- From what you say.
- What I say or what I do!

572
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:38,874
No chats with me.

573
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:41,291
Do you understand?
You are Muslim or not?

574
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:42,708
Muslim, why?

575
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:45,874
I'll stone myself,
on the spot!

576
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:46,916
Insolent!

577
00:57:47,084 --> 00:57:50,166
Cursed is your father!
You soiled the name of Muslim!

578
00:57:50,542 --> 00:57:53,374
All are killed,
and thou harlot.

579
00:57:53,542 --> 00:57:55,166
I'll kill you!

580
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,999
Cursed be thy father, bitch!

581
00:57:58,584 --> 00:57:59,749
Bitch!

582
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,041
Forgive me.

583
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:32,541
Enough,
are you bickering elsewhere

584
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:35,124
Well, what was I saying?
Ah, yes!

585
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:38,499
You did well to say that,
otherwise they would have raped you.

586
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:40,291
Come between.

587
00:58:40,459 --> 00:58:43,041
- That's what I thought.
- You did well.

588
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:46,374
They never violate a whore.

589
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,458
You know why? Because ...

590
00:58:50,209 --> 00:58:51,541
what kind of man

591
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:53,583
does not put his dirty thing

592
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,249
a hole that was used
hundreds of times.

593
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:58,124
But

594
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,208
raping a virgin,

595
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,708
it is their pride.

596
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,499
They show their manhood.

597
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,958
They are the strongest.

598
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,958
Stay here tonight.

599
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:16,124
I fear that lack of serum.

600
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:18,458
Take tea then.

601
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:52,499
I wanted to go with you.

602
00:59:53,834 --> 00:59:55,291
Stay with you.

603
00:59:58,542 --> 01:00:01,124
I'm afraid it will happen again
a misfortune.

604
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,708
The girls are safe
with my aunt.

605
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:13,791
They like my aunt.

606
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:20,666
Every night,
it tells a story.

607
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:23,541
What they would do here?

608
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:25,916
There is no water or electricity.

609
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:28,541
Stop!

610
01:00:46,584 --> 01:00:48,874
I have so many things
to tell you.

611
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:53,499
I will tell you maybe everything.

612
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,291
I do not know how
you're going to take

613
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:01,083
that thou shalt say.

614
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:06,333
Tomorrow I'll tell you everything.

615
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:07,208
Agree?

616
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,416
I'm tired.

617
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:14,541
I must sleep.

618
01:01:59,209 --> 01:02:00,458
Who are you?

619
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:05,541
- This is ... this is ... how?
- What do you want?

620
01:02:06,084 --> 01:02:07,166
What?

621
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,083
This is ... com ... well?

622
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:12,999
What?

623
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:18,124
This is ... this is ...

624
01:02:18,459 --> 01:02:19,583
how?

625
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,583
But I'm not a whore!

626
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:51,499
It's over?

627
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:52,666
Shut ...

628
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,999
shut up!

629
01:02:56,084 --> 01:02:57,666
It was your first time?

630
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:03,166
Arise now!

631
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,124
So ...

632
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:09,999
let me get up.

633
01:03:33,834 --> 01:03:35,708
You are here?

634
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,458
The poor,

635
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:45,041
it made me think of you.

636
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,166
His heart was pounding.

637
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:51,791
You were as clumsy as him.

638
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:55,666
I did not know what to do.

639
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:59,374
I had no idea
what to do.

640
01:06:01,042 --> 01:06:04,083
I thought it was
as you did.

641
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,499
I felt nothing,

642
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:10,249
only pain.

643
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:16,124
After I started
to please me alone.

644
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,916
Some nights
when you were sleeping, I stroked.

645
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:28,583
One night, you woke up
wondering what I was doing.

646
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:29,958
I said

647
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:32,041
I had a fever.

648
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,833
I was hot and sweaty.

649
01:06:37,209 --> 01:06:40,041
You sent me to sleep
with children.

650
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,249
My aunt was right to say:

651
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:50,249
"Those who do not know
make love, make war. "

652
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:19,208
Mullah came again.

653
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,874
I have lied to him.

654
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:27,499
I told her
I still had my period.

655
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:29,791
That he was not pleased.

656
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:32,666
He went to bitching.

657
01:07:34,334 --> 01:07:36,749
The poor, he became a coward.

658
01:07:42,084 --> 01:07:43,958
To you too, I lied.

659
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,416
For our first night,

660
01:07:49,667 --> 01:07:52,708
you thought it was blood
my virginity.

661
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,958
But I had my period.

662
01:07:58,459 --> 01:08:00,166
I you had hidden,

663
01:08:02,084 --> 01:08:04,249
on the advice of my aunt.

664
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:08,749
I was a virgin, but I was afraid,

665
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:12,791
fear of not losing blood.

666
01:08:22,084 --> 01:08:22,999
Get out!

667
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,166
Come on!

668
01:08:26,334 --> 01:08:27,416
Get out!

669
01:08:28,417 --> 01:08:30,708
Go play in the garden.

670
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:32,124
Come on!

671
01:08:38,959 --> 01:08:41,999
- What are you doing?
- You see!

672
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:44,208
It's time.

673
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,541
Remove it!

674
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:50,249
It's been three days
you make me run!

675
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:52,833
A little modesty, anyway!

676
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,874
You're kidding!

677
01:09:13,959 --> 01:09:17,124
- You can deliver me from the water?
- Okay.

678
01:09:28,584 --> 01:09:29,874
I have a little money,

679
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,791
I bought the serum and eye drops.

680
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,999
I bought to eat too.

681
01:10:10,292 --> 01:10:12,333
I'll wash the cloth.

682
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,791
I return.

683
01:10:40,917 --> 01:10:42,624
What do you want?

684
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,124
This boy did pity me.

685
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:01,749
At one point, I had a laugh.

686
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:06,833
He thought I was mocking him.
He almost left.

687
01:13:09,209 --> 01:13:11,208
You know why I laughed?

688
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:16,374
Because my aunt.

689
01:13:18,334 --> 01:13:20,958
I had talked about this boy,

690
01:13:22,209 --> 01:13:24,499
his stuttering

691
01:13:25,459 --> 01:13:27,249
and enjoys too fast.

692
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:29,291
My aunt told me:

693
01:13:30,084 --> 01:13:31,499
"Advise him

694
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:37,083
"Kiss with her tongue
and talk with her tail. "

695
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:41,208
As soon as I remembered
this sentence

696
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,166
I laughed!

697
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,333
I immediately thought of you
and I stopped laughing.

698
01:13:50,917 --> 01:13:54,666
It should not hurt
young with that, it's dangerous.

699
01:13:55,959 --> 01:13:59,333
They think only of their tail
and nothing else.

700
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:03,249
Well, it happened.

701
01:14:06,959 --> 01:14:08,209
Water carrier!

702
01:14:10,162 --> 01:14:11,374
Water carrier!

703
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,124
The toilet!

704
01:14:14,084 --> 01:14:15,833
They are empty!

705
01:14:32,917 --> 01:14:34,833
The boy learns quickly.

706
01:14:37,459 --> 01:14:39,249
It is not like you.

707
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:43,083
It accepts
everything I tell him.

708
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:45,458
It does not upset.

709
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:52,874
You have killed me
if I told you that.

710
01:14:54,417 --> 01:14:57,916
All that mattered to you,
it was your soul.

711
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:01,208
Your soul, your honor.

712
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,499
What about me? Nothing.

713
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,374
A piece of meat.

714
01:15:11,584 --> 01:15:13,208
The boy,

715
01:15:16,584 --> 01:15:18,291
I take her hand.

716
01:15:19,334 --> 01:15:21,374
I put on my breasts,

717
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,249
between my thighs.

718
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,124
He lets me do.

719
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,666
I guide.

720
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:43,041
Where is the rosary?

721
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:51,333
Why would I say that?

722
01:15:53,459 --> 01:15:56,124
The other women
never talk about it!

723
01:15:57,042 --> 01:15:58,291
Never.

724
01:15:59,292 --> 01:16:00,541
But I ...

725
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:04,333
I owned ...

726
01:16:05,709 --> 01:16:07,374
by a satanic spirit.

727
01:16:07,834 --> 01:16:09,249
The Koran?

728
01:16:11,459 --> 01:16:13,208
You have not seen the Koran?

729
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,999
I was at what sura?

730
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,900
Peacock feather?

731
01:16:31,372 --> 01:16:32,833
Peacock feather?

732
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,708
Where is she?

733
01:16:37,084 --> 01:16:39,374
It holds all my secrets.

734
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:50,275
Forgive me.

735
01:16:51,212 --> 01:16:52,666
Forgive me.

736
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:55,583
I should not talk about it.

737
01:17:06,417 --> 01:17:09,041
Today
I wanted to tell you everything.

738
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,249
I have not succeeded.

739
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:17,708
Someone repaired the gate.

740
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,666
Last night I had a dream.

741
01:19:33,209 --> 01:19:35,291
I gave birth to a boy.

742
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:40,291
His face was wrinkled,

743
01:19:42,959 --> 01:19:44,666
like my grandfather.

744
01:19:59,959 --> 01:20:00,999
It's you!

745
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:03,499
Good ... hello.

746
01:20:03,834 --> 01:20:04,624
Hello.

747
01:20:04,792 --> 01:20:06,666
Today, I can not.

748
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:08,416
Not today.

749
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:13,499
Seu ... only ...

750
01:20:13,667 --> 01:20:15,249
No, no.

751
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:24,624
I can not.

752
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:28,208
- Today I can not.
- I ...

753
01:20:28,834 --> 01:20:31,041
re ... pa ... re the portal.

754
01:20:31,209 --> 01:20:32,916
Oh, it was you.

755
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:34,874
Thank you.

756
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:39,208
I ... can ... enter?

757
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:42,791
No, I said no,
I have to work.

758
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:56,583
A ... mi ... minute.

759
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,833
I know we can do it quickly.

760
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,791
But I have work.

761
01:21:02,584 --> 01:21:05,041
I expect someone else.

762
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,291
Seu ... seu ...

763
01:21:23,042 --> 01:21:26,291
only ...

764
01:21:28,042 --> 01:21:29,083
speak.

765
01:21:30,834 --> 01:21:31,791
Go.

766
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:55,541
What do you want from me?

767
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:07,666
I told you
I could not today.

768
01:22:31,959 --> 01:22:34,249
I need to see someone else.

769
01:22:42,084 --> 01:22:43,666
Well, tell me.

770
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:55,249
The com ... Commander ...

771
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:57,416
of ... the other ... daytime

772
01:22:57,584 --> 01:22:59,916
What you have on the body?

773
01:23:01,459 --> 01:23:02,708
What is it?

774
01:23:03,334 --> 01:23:07,333
This is ... a ... burning
of ... one ... cigarette.

775
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:11,166
Who did this?

776
01:23:11,334 --> 01:23:14,208
The ... commanding

777
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,999
that ... is ... came another ... day.

778
01:23:19,959 --> 01:23:22,458
I ... also have in my back.

779
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:47,624
That bastard,

780
01:23:48,334 --> 01:23:50,916
this son of a bitch ...

781
01:23:57,042 --> 01:23:59,416
The commander
who spit on me,

782
01:23:59,709 --> 01:24:01,666
who wanted to kill me.

783
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:06,208
You know what he did to that boy?

784
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,833
It was an orphan.

785
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:13,999
He found it in the street.

786
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:20,291
The day he puts a Kalashnikov
hands

787
01:24:20,459 --> 01:24:23,208
and evening bells
feet.

788
01:24:28,584 --> 01:24:31,083
His body is covered in burns.

789
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,291
His chest,

790
01:24:34,959 --> 01:24:36,291
his back.

791
01:24:40,459 --> 01:24:43,124
It burns
with the barrel of his rifle,

792
01:24:44,584 --> 01:24:46,249
and cigarettes.

793
01:24:50,459 --> 01:24:51,708
The bastard!

794
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:56,999
The son of the damned!

795
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:02,041
Allah tells Muhammad to say:

796
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:04,124
"If I knew the hidden meaning

797
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:07,499
"I have done my goodness,

798
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,874
"And dismissed me wrong."

799
01:25:10,042 --> 01:25:13,208
One day the Prophet said to his wife:

800
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:16,333
"Oh Khadija
soon I'm going crazy.

801
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,166
"I am possessed.

802
01:25:18,334 --> 01:25:21,166
"I hear voices
coming out of the stones.

803
01:25:21,334 --> 01:25:24,083
"At night, I approach a monster."

804
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:28,583
So Khadija asked:

805
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:32,749
"Let me know
to the next occurrence. "

806
01:25:32,917 --> 01:25:36,708
And one day, the Prophet said:

807
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,333
"Khadija, I see."

808
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:44,458
Khadija then took off her veil

809
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:47,416
and asked Muhammad:
"You can still see?

810
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,791
"No, I do not see him."

811
01:25:49,959 --> 01:25:53,333
Khadija said:

812
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,916
"It was not a monster
or a jinn. She was an angel.

813
01:25:57,084 --> 01:26:00,874
"A jinn would have had no respect
for my hair.

814
01:26:01,042 --> 01:26:03,249
"He would not have fled ..."

815
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:05,874
What bothers
in this story?

816
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:08,499
The Prophet says:

817
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:10,541
"If I knew the hidden meaning

818
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:13,249
"I have done my goodness

819
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:15,458
"And dismissed me wrong."

820
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:16,791
So what?

821
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:21,208
Evil could reach
Prophet?

822
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:23,916
My daughter,
The Prophet was a man,

823
01:26:24,709 --> 01:26:26,541
sent by God,

824
01:26:27,042 --> 01:26:28,958
like a hundred thousand other
Prophets.

825
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,416
Khadija, what she wanted?

826
01:26:31,584 --> 01:26:32,999
Khadija?

827
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:37,291
She did not want
the Prophet feels ...

828
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:38,791
spellbound.

829
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:41,916
She wanted to open her eyes.

830
01:26:43,292 --> 01:26:45,874
She wanted to tear
its illusions.

831
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,624
She wanted ...

832
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:53,499
Muhammad reaches
his prophetic truth.

833
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:59,166
This is it, Khadija
that would have been the Prophet.

834
01:27:06,084 --> 01:27:08,541
Today, everything is calm.

835
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:12,166
They might be up
curfew.

836
01:27:13,334 --> 01:27:15,291
I can stay late.

837
01:27:16,834 --> 01:27:18,791
I am very tired.

838
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:22,208
Last night I did not sleep well.

839
01:27:32,084 --> 01:27:33,416
Who is it?

840
01:28:34,834 --> 01:28:37,624
Someone just dropped it.

841
01:28:51,542 --> 01:28:53,124
It is crazy.

842
01:28:55,209 --> 01:28:57,083
He lost his head.

843
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,583
I should have killed him the first day.

844
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:09,041
I could not.

845
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:19,874
It does not bother you
if I tell you about him?

846
01:29:20,709 --> 01:29:22,374
That I welcome here?

847
01:29:22,542 --> 01:29:24,958
I am under no illusions.

848
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:27,291
Do not worry.

849
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:33,499
I know it can be awful,

850
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:36,583
like you.

851
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:40,999
You too, if you come back to life,
you will return the same animal.

852
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:45,416
No?

853
01:29:50,834 --> 01:29:52,624
Or maybe you will change.

854
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,374
You will change.

855
01:29:57,417 --> 01:29:58,708
I'm sure.

856
01:30:04,334 --> 01:30:06,624
You will smile to me.

857
01:30:07,959 --> 01:30:09,916
You kiss me.

858
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,458
You take me in your arms.

859
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:21,416
You make me love
as I want.

860
01:30:25,084 --> 01:30:26,958
You love me.

861
01:30:34,834 --> 01:30:38,249
Because now
you know all my secrets.

862
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:42,708
You and I

863
01:30:43,709 --> 01:30:46,249
it is no longer the same.

864
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,541
What do I do?

865
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,708
My God, what do I do?

866
01:31:14,834 --> 01:31:16,666
God, help me!

867
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:18,124
The Koran!

868
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,166
Where is the Koran?

869
01:31:21,917 --> 01:31:23,874
Someone took it.

870
01:31:24,334 --> 01:31:25,624
My God!

871
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:30,458
Help me.

872
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:32,791
I'm going crazy.

873
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:36,416
No, no.

874
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:42,291
No, I'm not crazy.

875
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:44,374
Neither mad

876
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:47,166
or bewitched

877
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,374
or possessed.

878
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:52,916
I do not need anyone.

879
01:31:53,709 --> 01:31:55,124
Person.

880
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:21,999
I thought it would be
hard to tell,

881
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:24,249
or even impossible.

882
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:27,208
But no.

883
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,791
Now, with you,
everything is possible.

884
01:32:33,709 --> 01:32:35,249
You can do anything,

885
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,416
it all.

886
01:32:42,167 --> 01:32:44,208
Where to start?

887
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:48,041
For our first daughter.

888
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:54,666
When I was pregnant, I prayed
to a miscarriage.

889
01:32:55,834 --> 01:32:58,166
This child was my secret.

890
01:32:59,042 --> 01:33:00,708
It was my secret.

891
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:07,374
At delivery, I wanted
stifle between my legs

892
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,791
but it gave me opium.

893
01:33:10,959 --> 01:33:13,333
I was stunned, I could not.

894
01:33:15,459 --> 01:33:18,624
Seeing that it was a girl,
I was reassured.

895
01:33:19,584 --> 01:33:22,624
A girl would not betray
the secret of his mother.

896
01:33:26,917 --> 01:33:30,208
You know why
I did not want this child?

897
01:33:58,084 --> 01:33:59,458
It was not you.

898
01:34:01,834 --> 01:34:03,916
The second either.

899
01:34:06,334 --> 01:34:09,208
I was not sterile.
You, you were.

900
01:34:10,042 --> 01:34:11,374
Nobody knew.

901
01:34:13,709 --> 01:34:16,958
Your mother does not want to know.
Do you remember?

902
01:34:19,375 --> 01:34:22,416
She wanted you to take
another woman.

903
01:34:23,667 --> 01:34:24,958
What would I become?

904
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,791
My aunt came to my rescue.

905
01:34:28,959 --> 01:34:30,999
I asked his advice.

906
01:34:31,292 --> 01:34:33,083
She found the solution:

907
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:37,166
tell your mother that there
a healer who works miracles.

908
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,708
Oh, all the money spent
by your mother!

909
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:45,833
She told you nothing.

910
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:52,958
Each time, she said:
"This is your last chance."

911
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:02,708
After several consultations
home, I got pregnant.

912
01:35:05,875 --> 01:35:07,458
You want to know who it was?

913
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,291
It was my aunt mackerel.

914
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:33,666
You want to know the miracle?

915
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:36,791
I tell you?

916
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,458
He put me in a dark room
with a man blindfolded.

917
01:35:54,959 --> 01:35:56,708
Absolute Black.

918
01:35:59,792 --> 01:36:02,333
The man had no right
talk to me

919
01:36:02,542 --> 01:36:04,083
or touch me.

920
01:36:05,584 --> 01:36:07,541
We have never been naked.

921
01:36:08,792 --> 01:36:11,249
I never saw his face.

922
01:36:13,209 --> 01:36:16,624
I think he was young and strong,

923
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,458
but without experience.

924
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:24,208
My aunt gave me advice
to guide.

925
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:34,791
The first time,
nothing happened.

926
01:36:35,709 --> 01:36:36,999
At first,

927
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,458
I cried softly.

928
01:36:43,042 --> 01:36:45,666
Then I screamed and vomited.

929
01:36:46,584 --> 01:36:48,374
They drove me to the room.

930
01:36:49,375 --> 01:36:51,666
I did not want to return.

931
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:57,499
Gradually, it was fixed.

932
01:37:01,084 --> 01:37:02,541
I accepted,

933
01:37:04,834 --> 01:37:06,208
with a ...

934
01:37:06,917 --> 01:37:08,666
guilt.

935
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:20,666
When I was pregnant, your mother
clung to the healer.

936
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:23,374
She told
he worked miracles.

937
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:26,916
She often bought her
talismans.

938
01:37:32,292 --> 01:37:36,666
For the second, I do not know
if it was the same man.

939
01:37:37,959 --> 01:37:39,583
Still in the dark.

940
01:37:43,834 --> 01:37:44,916
You?

941
01:37:50,834 --> 01:37:52,749
You came back to life?

942
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:56,541
My stone of patience.

943
01:37:58,709 --> 01:38:00,374
You came back to me!

944
01:38:02,875 --> 01:38:04,041
The stone of patience.

945
01:38:04,917 --> 01:38:06,458
You broke!

946
01:38:07,417 --> 01:38:08,916
I brought you,

947
01:38:10,042 --> 01:38:10,791
me

948
01:38:12,959 --> 01:38:13,708
myself.

949
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:39,916
I became a Prophet ...

950
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:44,666
who performed a miracle.

951
01:38:56,417 --> 01:38:58,499
I became a Prophet ...

952
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:14,666
