1
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:41,843
My name is Kathy H.

2
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,013
I'm 28 years old.

3
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,727
I've been a carer
for nine years.

4
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,068
And I'm good at my job.

5
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:03,697
My patients always do
better than expected

6
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,782
and are hardly ever
classified as agitated,

7
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:10,078
even if they're
about to make a donation.

8
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:15,042
I'm not trying to boast,

9
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:18,253
but I feel a great sense
of pride in what we do.

10
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:21,965
Carers and donors
have achieved so much.

11
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,595
That said,
we aren't machines.

12
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,351
In the end,
it wears you down.

13
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:39,607
I suppose that's why I now spend
most of my time not looking forwards

14
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:41,859
but looking back,

15
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:45,154
to The Cottages and Hailsham,

16
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:47,657
and what happened to us there.

17
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,576
Me,

18
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:53,829
Tommy,

19
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:56,749
and Ruth.

20
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,388
When we are
scattered afar and asunder

21
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:16,226
Parted are those
who are singing today

22
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:21,815
When we look back
and forgetfully wonder

23
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:26,861
What we were like
in our learning and play

24
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:32,491
Oh, the great days
will bring distance enchanted

25
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:37,579
Days of fresh air in
the rain and the sun

26
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:42,876
How we rejoiced as we
struggled and panted

27
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:49,883
Echoes of dreamland,
Hailsham lives on

28
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,434
Good morning, students.

29
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:01,395
Good morning, Miss Emily.

30
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:06,649
It has come to my attention that three
burned cigarettes were discovered,

31
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:10,111
hidden behind a pot
in the flower garden.

32
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,574
I know that on occasion
students have seen

33
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:18,453
some of the caretakers and
deliverymen smoking cigarettes,

34
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:22,999
but I must emphasize, once
again, that it is much, much worse

35
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,586
for a student of Hailsham to
smoke cigarettes than anyone else.

36
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:32,341
Students of Hailsham
are special.

37
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,430
Keeping yourselves well, keeping
yourselves healthy inside,

38
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:40,682
is of paramount importance.

39
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:42,976
Have I made myself clear?

40
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:45,187
Yes, Miss Emily.

41
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:51,443
I think, one day,
I'd like five horses.

42
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:57,199
I don't know all their names,
but I know I'd like five horses.

43
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:59,034
The best
would be Thunder.

44
00:04:59,118 --> 00:05:02,287
He'd be dangerous to ride,
so you can't ride him.

45
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,456
You can ride

46
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,042
Bramble.

47
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:11,879
Just so long as you don't
use your crop on him.

48
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:15,549
That's pretty.

49
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:17,051
You have it.

50
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,640
Look. Who's that
with Miss Emily?

51
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:26,310
Do you think
it's the new guardian?

52
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,561
Miss Lucy.

53
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:31,023
I think it must be.

54
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:33,734
We haven't had
a new guardian for ages.

55
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:48,832
Arthur! Arthur!

56
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,254
Catch it, Tommy.

57
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:19,570
Why didn't Tommy
get the ball?

58
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:22,948
Excuse me, Miss Lucy?

59
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,617
Why didn't Tommy
get the ball?

60
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,661
When it bounced
over the fence,

61
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:29,121
it couldn't have
been far from him.

62
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,166
The fence is the boundary
of the Hailsham grounds.

63
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,960
We don't go outside
the boundary, Miss Lucy.

64
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,962
It's too dangerous.

65
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:38,881
Dangerous?

66
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,591
There was once a boy who
had a big row with all his friends

67
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:44,051
and then ran off
beyond the boundary.

68
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:48,347
They found him, two days later,
in the woods. Tied to a tree.

69
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,474
With his hands
and feet cut off.

70
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:52,518
Dead.

71
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,271
And there was the girl
who climbed over the fence,

72
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:56,689
by the front gate.

73
00:06:56,773 --> 00:07:00,026
And when she tried to get
back, she wasn't allowed.

74
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,945
And then she starved.
Out there.

75
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:05,406
Right by the gates.

76
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,327
Who told you
these stories?

77
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,912
Everybody knows them.

78
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:13,830
And how do you know
they're true?

79
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:15,165
Of course
they're true.

80
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,543
Who'd make up stories
as horrible as that?

81
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,072
Tommy, what are you doing?

82
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:50,491
What is it, exactly?

83
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:53,369
I think it must be a dog.
Is it a dog, Tommy?

84
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:56,288
It can't be a dog.
Its eyes are too small.

85
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:58,874
I think it must be
a kind of rat.

86
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,751
Yes, that's it.
Tommy's drawn a rat.

87
00:08:00,835 --> 00:08:01,919
It's not finished yet.

88
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,004
That's right. You haven't
finished the whiskers.

89
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,048
Do you think Tommy's rat will
be selected for The Gallery?

90
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,675
It's not a rat.

91
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:12,054
It's an elephant.

92
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,055
Children,
back to work.

93
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,296
He's got his shirt on.
His favorite polo shirt.

94
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:50,924
He really doesn't
suspect a thing.

95
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:55,220
Looks like no one
wants you, Tommy.

96
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:08,358
What's he doing?

97
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:09,860
It's his own fault.

98
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:13,405
If he learnt to keep his cool,
they'd leave him alone.

99
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:15,532
I hate you!
I hate you all!

100
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:16,824
Kath... No, don't!

101
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,754
You shouldn't have...

102
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:53,818
Kathy H.

103
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,666
What's this from?

104
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,002
I don't remember.

105
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,046
Doctor?

106
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:22,513
It's nothing.
Just a bruise.

107
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:30,813
Hello.

108
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:33,357
Kathy. Kathy H.

109
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:36,527
Of course. Kathy H.

110
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:38,737
Come in.

111
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,286
So what can
I do for you?

112
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:49,164
Well,

113
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:53,042
I was wondering
what you said to Tommy.

114
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,170
Out on the
playing fields.

115
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,256
I see. Oh.

116
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:00,842
So what did I say?

117
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:05,763
I believe I was trying
to calm him down.

118
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,723
Because he seemed upset.

119
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:11,811
He explained he was often
teased about sport and art,

120
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:15,231
so I told him he shouldn't
get upset about these things.

121
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,277
The other children are only
teasing him to get a reaction.

122
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:24,072
And if it happens that he's not
particularly good at sport or art,

123
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:26,199
well, that doesn't matter.

124
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:28,869
It's not so important.

125
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:36,084
Thank you.

126
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:00,274
Kathy.

127
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:04,695
Aren't you sitting
with the girls?

128
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:05,779
Well, I just checked

129
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:08,491
and I'm pretty sure I'm
not sitting with the girls.

130
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,825
I'm sitting with you.

131
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,662
I wanted to say

132
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,583
I'm sorry.

133
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,961
I didn't mean
to hit you.

134
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,716
I mean, I wouldn't
want to hit any girl.

135
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,178
But particularly
not you.

136
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,432
Well, it was an accident, that's all.

137
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:39,229
Tommy,
finish those vegetables.

138
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:59,081
I'm not gonna get angry
like that anymore.

139
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:02,960
Because of what Miss Lucy
told you, about being creative?

140
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:04,628
How do you know
about that?

141
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:05,754
I'm nosey.

142
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:13,387
She can't actually mean that being
creative isn't important, can she?

143
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:15,764
I mean, what about
The Gallery?

144
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:17,849
If being creative
isn't important,

145
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:19,935
then why have
a gallery at all?

146
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,189
I don't know.

147
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:32,697
...by arching her back, or
perhaps with the aid of a pillow,

148
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:35,616
the woman can
arrange herself...

149
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,801
Smile

150
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,399
Good morning, ma'am.

151
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:10,650
Good morning.

152
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:12,235
Can I help you?

153
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,238
I wanted one tea, with
milk and sugar in it.

154
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,533
One tea. Right.

155
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,583
Tommy.

156
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,252
Oh! One tea with milk
and sugar in it, please.

157
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:31,588
No, Tommy.

158
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,383
I want to hear
your own order.

159
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:38,135
Don't simply repeat
the one you've just heard.

160
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:41,764
What other drinks
do they serve in cafes?

161
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,182
Water.

162
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,437
Coffee.

163
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:51,607
So, then.

164
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:53,776
So, then,

165
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:57,613
one coffee, please, with
milk and sugar in it.

166
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:04,827
Thank you.

167
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:15,797
I think Laura likes Arthur.

168
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:19,258
All the girls
like Arthur, don't they?

169
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,636
Maybe.

170
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,555
I'm not sure you do.

171
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,059
He's not my type.

172
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:31,396
I think Laura and Arthur will be
the first in our year to have sex

173
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,940
because, if Arthur wants to,
Laura wouldn't stop him.

174
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,818
I'm sure you're right.

175
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:43,615
Tommy's changed.

176
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:46,034
Changed how?

177
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,829
Just changed.

178
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:51,373
That's all.

179
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:24,363
What about this
one by Madeleine Kane?

180
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,033
I think it shows more
than technical ability.

181
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:30,745
It gives a real insight
into the child.

182
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:33,914
Which is precisely what
Marie-Claude wants for The Gallery.

183
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:35,791
Yes, I agree.

184
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:40,628
Mmm.

185
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,047
Put these
two together.

186
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,759
Madame is coming.

187
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,101
Good morning, students.

188
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:41,229
Good morning, Miss Emily.

189
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:45,316
There are several
points of order today.

190
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,153
The first is that our good friend,
Madame Marie-Claude, is visiting us.

191
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:53,533
She will, as usual, be carefully
inspecting your artwork and poetry

192
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,662
and selecting the very best pieces
for inclusion in her Gallery.

193
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,540
We will, of course,
extend to her every courtesy

194
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:03,292
and make her feel
most welcome.

195
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:07,213
Second point of order, a piece
of good news for all students

196
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:10,174
who have been diligent
in collecting tokens.

197
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:13,385
After studies tomorrow,
there will be a sale.

198
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,972
The delivery
will arrive in the morning,

199
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,432
and I was assured
by the van driver

200
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:22,769
that the boxes will
contain a bumper crop.

201
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,653
Is it really
a bumper crop?

202
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,449
I should say so. Yeah,
sweetheart. It's a bumper crop.

203
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:25,638
Hey.

204
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:28,516
Aren't you buying?

205
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:32,353
If you've already spent all your
tokens, you can have some of mine.

206
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:36,190
I have tokens. I was just gonna
wait till the rush died down.

207
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:39,026
I'm sure there'll be
something good left.

208
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:42,113
What's the matter, Kath?

209
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,493
Well, anyway,
it doesn't matter

210
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:50,120
if you can't find
anything in the sale

211
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:53,832
because I already
found you something.

212
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:58,003
A music tape.

213
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,715
I don't know much about it,
if it's much good or anything.

214
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:07,387
Thank you.

215
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:15,145
* Darling *

216
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:28,824
* Hold me *

217
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:30,492
* And never *

218
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:35,330
* Never *

219
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:39,626
* Let me go *

220
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,221
* Darling *

221
00:21:53,348 --> 00:22:04,609
* Kiss me *

222
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,569
* And never *

223
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:11,199
* Never *

224
00:22:11,658 --> 00:22:16,370
* Let me go *

225
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:49,319
The problem is

226
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:53,698
you've been told
and not told.

227
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:57,034
That's what I've seen
while I've been here.

228
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,287
You've been told

229
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,207
but none of you
really understand.

230
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:08,337
So I've decided I'll talk to you
in a way that you will understand.

231
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:14,301
Do you know what happens to
children when they grow up?

232
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:20,766
No, you don't,
because nobody knows.

233
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:25,646
They might grow up
to become actors,

234
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:28,606
move to America.

235
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:32,861
Or they might work
in supermarkets.

236
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,280
Or teach in schools.

237
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:41,202
They might become sportsmen or bus
conductors or racing car drivers.

238
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,872
They might do
almost anything.

239
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,168
But with you
we do know.

240
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,590
None of you
will go to America.

241
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:58,344
None of you will work
in supermarkets.

242
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:02,890
None of you will do
anything except live the life

243
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,184
that has already
been set out for you.

244
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:09,897
You will
become adults,

245
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:13,317
but only briefly.

246
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,488
Before you are old,

247
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:22,409
before you are
even middle-aged,

248
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:26,163
you will start to donate
your vital organs.

249
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,167
That's what you were
created to do.

250
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,174
And sometime around your
third or fourth donation,

251
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:42,011
your short life
will be complete.

252
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:48,100
You have to know who
you are and what you are.

253
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:52,230
It's the only way
you'll lead decent lives.

254
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:46,657
There will be only one
announcement this morning,

255
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:49,451
which is that Miss Lucy,

256
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:51,954
who was guardian
to the fourth-year students,

257
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,707
is no longer
working at Hailsham.

258
00:25:58,628 --> 00:26:01,505
A replacement will be found
for her, and in the meantime

259
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:05,591
her classes will be divided
between Miss Geraldine and myself.

260
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,263
It is hard, is it not,

261
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:14,809
to continue in the face
of deliberate subversion.

262
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:20,606
There are those who seek
to thwart us, this is clear.

263
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:24,694
And we are aware that the tide
is not with forward thinking.

264
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:26,112
It never is.

265
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:31,034
No, the tide is with
the entrenched mindset.

266
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:33,745
With values that
are still unexamined.

267
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:38,874
But I will not be coerced.

268
00:26:43,796 --> 00:26:45,964
I will not be coerced.

269
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:51,303
And neither will Hailsham.

270
00:27:55,825 --> 00:28:00,370
I didn't understand
why, after all her teasing,

271
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:05,583
Ruth would decide that Tommy was
the boy she liked most of all.

272
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:17,845
They say girls are always mean
to the boys they like.

273
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:24,226
So maybe Ruth
had liked him all along.

274
00:28:29,232 --> 00:28:32,109
Maybe I should have
teased him, too.

275
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:48,749
I kept hoping
they would separate,

276
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:52,712
like the other childhood and
teenage romances at the school.

277
00:28:58,677 --> 00:29:00,219
They never did.

278
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:37,380
We were moved
from Hailsham at 18

279
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:39,883
and sent to various
accommodations around the country,

280
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:43,220
to wait until we were old
enough to start the donations.

281
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:47,848
Tommy, Ruth and I

282
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:51,894
were sent to a collection of farm
buildings called The Cottages.

283
00:29:57,734 --> 00:29:59,401
During our stay there,
we were told

284
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:03,113
that some of us would be
permitted to volunteer as carers.

285
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:09,495
But, apart from that, we'd be
left largely to our own devices

286
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:13,791
and even allowed to take day trips
into the surrounding countryside.

287
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:20,755
The Cottages were also
our first contact

288
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,758
with those who had not
grown up at Hailsham.

289
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:26,010
There were people
from White Mansion,

290
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:31,057
Oakhill, Morningdale and
other homes I'd never heard of.

291
00:30:33,978 --> 00:30:37,689
Everyone seemed wiser
and more worldly than us.

292
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:43,194
None more so than
Rodney and Chrissie.

293
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,989
They'd already been at The
Cottages for over a year

294
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:49,283
and would soon be leaving
for the completion centers.

295
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:52,119
Ricky? I don't
know what you're talking about.

296
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:54,079
Oh, I can
help you out there.

297
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:58,083
He's talking about blue eyes, blond
hair, cute dimples when he smiles.

298
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,877
And biceps that
could crack walnuts.

299
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:05,382
Jennifer, get real,
I saw you with him.

300
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:09,052
Jen and Ricky sitting in
a tree, K- I-S-S-I-N-G.

301
00:31:09,887 --> 00:31:12,431
That is so not true.

302
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:16,226
We weren't in a tree.

303
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:35,411
Hey.

304
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,250
Where you going?

305
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:44,045
I thought
I'd go for a walk.

306
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:48,424
Does that mean
you want to be alone?

307
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,581
I'm not even saying that
I'll apply to be a carer.

308
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:23,916
Just that several people have
said that I'd be good at it.

309
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,126
But then Laura went around
telling everyone

310
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,712
that I'd been saying I was the
most likely to get selected.

311
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:29,880
That's so not true.

312
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,423
So not true.

313
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,384
Thank you.

314
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:38,305
I'm getting
more plates.

315
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:41,809
Is there anything left for us?

316
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:43,936
I don't know.

317
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:47,690
Perhaps not.

318
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,402
Ruth, why do you
do that thing?

319
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:53,529
Squeezing
Tommy's shoulder.

320
00:32:55,864 --> 00:32:57,490
I'm allowed to touch Tommy, aren't I?

321
00:32:57,574 --> 00:32:59,826
It's the way
you're touching him.

322
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,328
You know what I mean. It's
copied from that television show.

323
00:33:03,497 --> 00:33:04,497
That's so not...

324
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:07,125
Don't tell me
"that's so not true. "

325
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:12,088
All that behavior, that's not what
people do out there, in real life,

326
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:13,423
if that's what
you were thinking.

327
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:16,592
So what? Look, it's no big
deal. A lot of us do it.

328
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:18,761
What you mean is
Chrissie and Rod do it.

329
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:21,681
Oh, Kathy.

330
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,643
So that's what
this is about.

331
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:28,687
It must be really
awful for you,

332
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:30,230
surrounded by
all these couples.

333
00:33:30,815 --> 00:33:34,609
I never said that.
I just think it's daft.

334
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,904
You copy them, and they
copy from a television show.

335
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:40,073
I'm right,
aren't I?

336
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:45,412
You don't like the fact that Tommy and
I are friends with Chrissie and Rod,

337
00:33:45,496 --> 00:33:47,372
whereas you hardly
speak to anyone.

338
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:53,378
No. You're not right.

339
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:56,465
"So" not right?

340
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:17,735
Thank you, Mr. Keffers.

341
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,801
Hello, Tommy.

342
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:28,387
Hello, Kath.

343
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:35,977
Well, don't just hover in the
doorway. Come in. Join the fun.

344
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:40,314
Didn't know you liked
that sort of stuff.

345
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:43,359
You're very welcome to them
after I've finished.

346
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:45,945
Oh, no,
it's just sex stuff.

347
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:49,323
I expect I've seen
them all already anyway.

348
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:55,746
Kathy, what are
you looking for?

349
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:59,834
What do you mean? I'm just
looking at dirty pictures.

350
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:02,253
What, just for kicks?

351
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:04,796
I suppose you could
say that, yes.

352
00:36:10,678 --> 00:36:14,139
If it's just for kicks, then
you don't do it like that.

353
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:17,976
You need to look at each
picture more carefully.

354
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:20,520
Nothing really happens
if you go that fast.

355
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:23,148
How do you know
what works for girls?

356
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,861
Kath, you're not
looking for kicks.

357
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:35,618
Here, give it to Ruth. See
if it does anything for her.

358
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:55,387
Hi.

359
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:00,184
I suppose you've heard what Rod
and Chrissie have been saying.

360
00:37:01,227 --> 00:37:02,728
No, I haven't.

361
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,943
Well, you know that
Rod and Chrissie

362
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,486
have been thinking of
applying to be carers,

363
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,570
so they've been
learning how to drive.

364
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:13,655
Yeah.

365
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,409
Well, last weekend, they went up
to a town on the Norfolk coast,

366
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,913
and they think
they saw this person.

367
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:23,498
What kind of person?

368
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,209
A lady

369
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,836
working in an office.

370
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,546
And...

371
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:33,925
What is it, Ruth?

372
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:38,679
But they thought this
person was a Possible.

373
00:37:41,057 --> 00:37:42,808
For me.

374
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:44,851
They found
your Original?

375
00:37:44,936 --> 00:37:47,270
They aren't sure,
obviously,

376
00:37:47,355 --> 00:37:50,357
but Rodney said that the
resemblance was really striking.

377
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:52,734
Oh, my God. Ruth!
I know.

378
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:57,656
They want to drive me back up
there so that I can see for myself.

379
00:37:57,782 --> 00:38:00,033
Tommy will come, but...

380
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:01,785
Do you want me to come?

381
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:07,249
Ruth, of course.

382
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:21,554
So, exactly how much experience
have you guys had with the outside?

383
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:23,472
Quite a lot.

384
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:24,974
No, we haven't.

385
00:38:26,643 --> 00:38:29,729
We did a lot of role-playing
exercises at Hailsham.

386
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:31,480
They don't count.

387
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:35,109
Okay. Well,
don't feel scared.

388
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:38,237
Okay? There's really...
There's nothing to it.

389
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:41,656
We aren't scared.

390
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:43,950
Good.

391
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:08,600
I'll get sausage,
egg and chips.

392
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:14,271
Sausage,
egg and chips, please.

393
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:15,439
Yes, sausage,
egg and chips.

394
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:17,566
Sausage, egg and chips,
me, too, please.

395
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:21,904
Well, I suppose I'd better get
sausage, egg and chips, too, then.

396
00:39:21,988 --> 00:39:26,116
Five sausage,
egg and chips. Drinks?

397
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,370
Five Cokes, please.

398
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,178
It was good.
It was really good.

399
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:49,931
What?
Sorry.

400
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:59,023
You know, there's something I've
been wanting to talk to you lot about.

401
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,652
The problem is that back there
at The Cottages it's impossible.

402
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:05,071
Someone's always
listening in.

403
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:07,824
So,

404
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:12,829
someone was saying that some
Hailsham students in the past

405
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:15,580
have managed
to get a deferral.

406
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:17,249
Apparently those
Hailsham students

407
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,418
could have their first
donation put back by three

408
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,547
or even four years.

409
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:28,927
As long as they qualified.

410
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:32,055
If there was a boy
and a girl,

411
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:34,474
and they were in love
with each other,

412
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,395
really properly in love,
and they could prove it,

413
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:41,982
then they would be given
a few years together

414
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:44,609
before they began
their donations.

415
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,030
Where did you
hear about this?

416
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,283
When we were
at White Mansion.

417
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,577
People there were always going
on about this Hailsham couple.

418
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,829
When the guy was only a
few weeks from donation,

419
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:00,416
he just went to see someone. He
applied, and everything got sorted out.

420
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:04,920
I suppose you lot would know
about that sort of thing.

421
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:08,799
Being from Hailsham, you'd know
how that sort of thing works.

422
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,802
Who is it
you go to?

423
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,307
Who would we talk to
if we wanted to apply?

424
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,608
To be honest, I don't know
what you're talking about.

425
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,153
Come on.

426
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,156
Do you expect us
to believe that?

427
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,075
Everybody knows
Hailsham is special.

428
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,328
So what is it?

429
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,207
Why keep these
things to yourself?

430
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,340
There were lots of
stories at Hailsham.

431
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,802
I don't think many of them
turned out to be true.

432
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:24,455
It may be
down here.

433
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:35,925
Yeah.

434
00:42:36,385 --> 00:42:37,718
That's it.

435
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:05,912
God, it must be her.

436
00:43:06,747 --> 00:43:09,207
Yeah, that's her.

437
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:37,192
It's not her.

438
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,821
I'm not her.
No, you're not.

439
00:43:41,114 --> 00:43:42,531
It was really
close, though.

440
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:45,200
Oh, shut up, Tommy! It wasn't
close. It wasn't close at all.

441
00:43:45,285 --> 00:43:48,620
And I knew it wasn't gonna be
her before we even got here!

442
00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:50,831
It was never
gonna be her.

443
00:43:50,957 --> 00:43:54,001
They never, ever model us
on people like that woman.

444
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:55,710
Ruth, don't.
What?

445
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:58,463
We all know it,
we just never say it.

446
00:43:59,757 --> 00:44:02,050
We are modeled on trash.

447
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:06,137
Junkies, prostitutes,
winos, tramps.

448
00:44:06,764 --> 00:44:09,849
Convicts, maybe, as long
as they aren't psychos.

449
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:14,979
If you want to look for Possibles,
if you want to do it properly,

450
00:44:17,149 --> 00:44:18,358
look in the gutter.

451
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:22,278
That's where we came from.

452
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:54,226
Hey.

453
00:45:25,715 --> 00:45:27,716
We should go back.

454
00:46:50,631 --> 00:46:53,257
Don't tell me
to calm down!

455
00:46:54,218 --> 00:46:56,552
You walked down the pier
and you left me there.

456
00:46:56,637 --> 00:46:58,304
You knew
I was well upset.

457
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,150
Out here.

458
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:31,753
Chrissie and Rod are pretty obsessed
about this rumor, aren't they?

459
00:47:31,837 --> 00:47:33,797
About the deferrals?
Mmm.

460
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:39,009
I was thinking about it
again last night,

461
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:41,470
and if this
rumor's true

462
00:47:42,681 --> 00:47:44,932
it might explain
a few things.

463
00:47:45,308 --> 00:47:46,767
Such as?
Well,

464
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:49,770
The Gallery,
for instance.

465
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:53,566
We never got to the bottom of
it, what The Gallery was for.

466
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:56,110
Pictures, poetry
and sculpture.

467
00:47:56,194 --> 00:47:57,736
Say something
about yourself.

468
00:47:57,904 --> 00:48:00,072
That's the whole point
about art, isn't it?

469
00:48:00,156 --> 00:48:03,409
It says what's inside of you.
It reveals your soul.

470
00:48:03,868 --> 00:48:05,452
Yeah. So?

471
00:48:15,296 --> 00:48:19,382
Suppose for a second
that the rumor is true.

472
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,677
That there is a special
arrangement for Hailsham students,

473
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:24,304
if they're in love.

474
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:28,558
Well, there would have
to be some kind of way

475
00:48:28,892 --> 00:48:32,895
to decide if couples
are telling the truth

476
00:48:33,314 --> 00:48:35,982
and not just lying
to put off their donations.

477
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,491
That's what The Gallery could be for.

478
00:48:47,368 --> 00:48:49,745
In The Gallery they have everything
about us they need to know.

479
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:52,164
So if we say that
we're in love,

480
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:56,293
they can look into our
souls and they can see.

481
00:48:56,377 --> 00:48:59,087
They'll know if it's real
love or if it's just a lie.

482
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:02,299
That's a strange idea, Tommy.

483
00:49:03,885 --> 00:49:04,968
What?

484
00:49:07,138 --> 00:49:10,140
No, no. I don't think that's
any stranger than any other idea.

485
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:13,643
And didn't Miss Lucy say that making art
for The Gallery wasn't even important?

486
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,102
Yes.

487
00:49:16,897 --> 00:49:19,106
But look what
happened to her.

488
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:32,161
Are you thinking
of applying?

489
00:49:32,954 --> 00:49:34,455
With Ruth?

490
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:38,876
No.

491
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,379
It wouldn't work.

492
00:49:43,297 --> 00:49:44,714
Why?

493
00:49:52,098 --> 00:49:53,640
Because

494
00:50:01,816 --> 00:50:03,316
you forget that

495
00:50:04,485 --> 00:50:07,070
you got lots of stuff into
The Gallery over the years,

496
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:10,615
and if I applied they wouldn't
have anything to go on.

497
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:27,214
It's all just rumors
and theories.

498
00:50:31,594 --> 00:50:33,053
Yeah, I know.

499
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:37,808
Tommy.

500
00:51:26,564 --> 00:51:38,116
* Kiss me *

501
00:51:38,201 --> 00:51:40,660
* And never *

502
00:51:40,745 --> 00:51:45,207
* Never *

503
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:49,084
* Let me go *

504
00:51:57,594 --> 00:51:59,762
* Lock my heart *

505
00:52:02,224 --> 00:52:05,684
* Throw away the key *

506
00:52:06,728 --> 00:52:09,563
* Feel my love *

507
00:52:28,457 --> 00:52:30,959
I know what
you think, Kathy.

508
00:52:34,213 --> 00:52:38,216
I know you think that you and Tommy
would have made a more natural couple,

509
00:52:38,968 --> 00:52:40,468
and you believe

510
00:52:40,553 --> 00:52:44,013
that there's a chance that Tommy
and I will split up some day.

511
00:52:45,474 --> 00:52:49,185
And when we do, perhaps that
will be your chance with Tommy.

512
00:52:50,145 --> 00:52:52,479
Chance to do it
right this time.

513
00:52:59,863 --> 00:53:02,531
But you see,
the thing is, Kathy,

514
00:53:03,074 --> 00:53:06,493
although Tommy really
likes you as a friend,

515
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,330
he just doesn't
see you that way.

516
00:53:14,502 --> 00:53:17,588
He told me about
the porno magazines.

517
00:53:20,383 --> 00:53:22,633
We had quite
a laugh about it.

518
00:53:25,596 --> 00:53:29,390
He doesn't understand
what you were doing.

519
00:53:31,476 --> 00:53:33,144
But I did.

520
00:53:36,857 --> 00:53:37,857
Oh!

521
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,754
I said I'll just be five minutes.

522
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:07,719
I want to be
a carer.

523
00:54:09,764 --> 00:54:11,139
It's you who
I apply to, isn't it?

524
00:54:11,223 --> 00:54:12,557
Yeah.

525
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,684
I said that
I'm applying.

526
00:54:17,063 --> 00:54:19,064
I'll bring
the forms tomorrow,

527
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:21,232
and that'll start
the process.

528
00:54:32,577 --> 00:54:35,746
By the time Ruth and
Tommy actually did separate,

529
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,957
my carer training
had already begun.

530
00:54:40,168 --> 00:54:42,753
So I was hardly ever
at The Cottages.

531
00:55:08,028 --> 00:55:11,197
It had never occurred to me
that our lives,

532
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:14,117
which had been
so closely interwoven,

533
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:19,622
could unravel
with such speed.

534
00:55:34,387 --> 00:55:35,846
If I'd known,

535
00:55:36,806 --> 00:55:39,141
maybe I'd have kept
tighter hold of them

536
00:55:41,602 --> 00:55:44,813
and not let unseen tides
pull us apart.

537
00:56:30,275 --> 00:56:31,941
Once I began working
with my donors,

538
00:56:32,026 --> 00:56:35,195
I didn't have much time
to dwell on Tommy or Ruth.

539
00:56:36,197 --> 00:56:37,906
Eventually,
so many years had passed

540
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:40,742
I came to think I would
never see them again.

541
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:51,586
Many carers find themselves
just going through the motions,

542
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:55,882
waiting for the day that they
can stop and become donors.

543
00:57:00,262 --> 00:57:03,806
But for the most part, being
a carer has suited me fine.

544
00:57:05,892 --> 00:57:09,144
I quite enjoy traveling
across the country,

545
00:57:09,229 --> 00:57:12,856
shuttling from center to
center, hospital to hospital.

546
00:57:26,496 --> 00:57:27,955
Here you are.

547
00:57:29,916 --> 00:57:31,416
Dark chocolate.

548
00:57:32,252 --> 00:57:35,586
If you knew how many shops I had
to go to before I found those.

549
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:39,215
I thought I wasn't allowed to
eat so soon before the operation.

550
00:57:39,299 --> 00:57:42,468
Oh, you're not.
But I am.

551
00:57:42,553 --> 00:57:43,678
And after the operation,

552
00:57:43,762 --> 00:57:46,722
you can wolf down
the whole packet in one go.

553
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,365
For me, the real
test of being a carer

554
00:58:04,449 --> 00:58:07,576
is when a donor completes
earlier than expected.

555
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:11,621
On the second
or even first donation.

556
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:13,415
Can I just have
a quick word?

557
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:14,583
Okay.

558
00:58:15,835 --> 00:58:18,211
I was wondering who'd be
working on Hannah today.

559
00:58:18,296 --> 00:58:21,631
I'd never say I've
become immune to the completions.

560
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:25,594
But they are something
I am able to live with.

561
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:32,434
You're Hannah's carer,
aren't you?

562
00:58:33,352 --> 00:58:35,103
Hannah's carer?
Yes.

563
00:58:36,397 --> 00:58:40,024
I'm sorry, it's always hard,
but there were complications.

564
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:45,613
You need me
to sign the release?

565
00:58:45,697 --> 00:58:46,906
Please.

566
00:58:49,117 --> 00:58:51,202
Are you going
to leave now?

567
00:58:51,286 --> 00:58:53,412
We can quite easily provide
you with a bed tonight

568
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:54,997
if you've got
a long drive.

569
00:58:55,123 --> 00:58:57,499
I can be back home
in under two hours.

570
00:58:57,584 --> 00:58:59,210
It's always better to
wake at home, isn't it?

571
00:59:08,761 --> 00:59:10,428
Is that someone
you know?

572
00:59:10,554 --> 00:59:12,013
Yeah.

573
00:59:14,391 --> 00:59:16,309
Actually,
we grew up together.

574
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:18,478
Oh.
How is she?

575
00:59:18,771 --> 00:59:20,647
Were you close?

576
00:59:20,773 --> 00:59:23,358
We haven't seen each other
now for almost 10 years.

577
00:59:23,442 --> 00:59:27,820
Well, Ruth isn't as strong as
we would hope, at this stage.

578
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:31,991
She's done
two donations.

579
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:33,868
She has.

580
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,371
You think she'll complete on the third?

581
00:59:37,248 --> 00:59:39,457
I think she wants
to complete.

582
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:44,711
And, as you know, when they want
to complete, they usually do.

583
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,582
Kathy.

584
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:18,969
I've been keeping
tabs on you over the years.

585
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,763
And Tommy, too.

586
01:01:21,097 --> 01:01:23,057
What do you
hear about Tommy?

587
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:26,393
That he's done
his second donation, too,

588
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:29,313
and apparently he's
doing very well on it.

589
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:31,148
Apparently
he's in better shape

590
01:01:31,232 --> 01:01:33,692
than some after
their first donation.

591
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:36,653
Good old Tommy.
I'm not surprised.

592
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:40,741
Are you surprised at me?

593
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:45,579
I expect I look
a bit broken, Kath.

594
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:49,499
It's okay.

595
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:52,835
I don't think I'd want to
survive my third donation, anyway.

596
01:01:53,504 --> 01:01:55,630
You hear things,
don't you?

597
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,799
What kind of things?

598
01:01:58,342 --> 01:02:00,134
Oh, you know.

599
01:02:03,347 --> 01:02:05,515
How, maybe,
after the fourth donation,

600
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,393
even if you've
technically completed,

601
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:11,687
you're still conscious
in some sort of way.

602
01:02:12,606 --> 01:02:16,776
And then you find out that there
are more donations, plenty of them.

603
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:21,071
No more recovery centers.
No more carers.

604
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:24,866
Just watching
and waiting.

605
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:28,954
Till they switch you off.

606
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:37,212
I don't think
I fancy that.

607
01:02:41,217 --> 01:02:43,635
Is it the end
of the day already?

608
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:46,763
Do you know,
it's funny,

609
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:51,142
I think I've thought about you
every day for the last few months.

610
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,227
Hoping I'd see you again.

611
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,731
Do you know, I felt sure that I would.

612
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:04,321
Seemed impossible that I'd complete
without seeing you one last time.

613
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,243
It's not
the last time, Ruth.

614
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:12,121
They offered me a bed.

615
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,582
I was planning on
staying the night anyway.

616
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,417
Well.

617
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:43,860
I always knew
you'd be a good carer.

618
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,446
Your donors
are very lucky.

619
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:54,912
Look, I was lying
awake last night

620
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:57,956
and I suddenly had an idea
that we'd take a trip together.

621
01:03:58,166 --> 01:03:59,958
Where to?

622
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,337
I hadn't much thought
of where, just a trip.

623
01:04:07,717 --> 01:04:09,301
Although

624
01:04:10,887 --> 01:04:12,638
a place
did spring to mind.

625
01:04:12,722 --> 01:04:15,224
One of the boys on the other
floor was talking about it.

626
01:04:15,308 --> 01:04:17,142
It's near the
Kingsfield Recovery Center.

627
01:04:17,644 --> 01:04:21,146
Is it the boat? The
one left on the beach?

628
01:04:21,272 --> 01:04:22,856
You've heard
about it, too?

629
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:25,483
I heard. One of the
carers who worked there.

630
01:04:28,695 --> 01:04:30,446
And do you suppose,

631
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:34,700
if we're driving
all that way,

632
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:37,745
that we could
call in on Tommy?

633
01:04:41,959 --> 01:04:44,919
Told you I'd been
keeping tabs on you.

634
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,047
Have you seen him?

635
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:50,633
No, not since
The Cottages.

636
01:04:51,677 --> 01:04:53,302
No, neither have I.

637
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:00,934
How will
we find him?

638
01:05:01,018 --> 01:05:03,687
His carer said
he'd be waiting outside.

639
01:05:20,538 --> 01:05:22,038
Look, there he is.

640
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,131
Do you think he's recognized
us through the glass?

641
01:05:34,384 --> 01:05:36,218
No, no, no.

642
01:05:36,303 --> 01:05:38,304
Let's not get out.

643
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:56,155
Ruth's
in the car.

644
01:05:56,239 --> 01:05:57,406
Oh, right.

645
01:05:57,532 --> 01:05:58,906
Hey!

646
01:05:59,366 --> 01:06:00,742
Hi!

647
01:06:02,244 --> 01:06:03,578
Hi.
Hi.

648
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,080
How are you?

649
01:06:06,165 --> 01:06:07,248
I'm good.

650
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:08,791
Look at your hair.

651
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:10,585
Oh, yeah.
My hair.

652
01:06:19,011 --> 01:06:21,346
I can't quite believe
that I have you both here.

653
01:06:24,391 --> 01:06:25,975
Does it feel to you that
we're back at Hailsham again?

654
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,353
Like no time
has passed?

655
01:06:28,979 --> 01:06:30,062
No, it doesn't.

656
01:06:30,146 --> 01:06:31,438
No, it doesn't
at all, does it?

657
01:06:31,856 --> 01:06:34,608
It really doesn't at all.
It's really weird.

658
01:06:34,734 --> 01:06:36,360
But a good weird, I think.

659
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,785
I don't suppose you both heard
that Hailsham was closed?

660
01:06:47,372 --> 01:06:50,624
The only schools left now, you
hear they're like battery farms.

661
01:06:51,668 --> 01:06:53,293
Like Morningdale.

662
01:06:53,753 --> 01:06:56,797
I'm sure that's
an exaggeration, though.

663
01:06:58,925 --> 01:07:01,134
Are you sure we're going the right way?

664
01:07:17,317 --> 01:07:18,818
It's locked,
it looks like.

665
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,237
No one said
anything about this.

666
01:07:21,321 --> 01:07:23,072
No one said anything
about a locked gate.

667
01:07:23,156 --> 01:07:25,991
Ruth, just relax.
It's okay.

668
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:36,501
Can walk through here.

669
01:08:04,529 --> 01:08:05,571
Wow.

670
01:08:19,043 --> 01:08:21,170
Hey, come on.

671
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,927
I wonder if that's
what Hailsham looks like now.

672
01:09:14,555 --> 01:09:17,516
Do you ever hear, Kath, about
any of the students from Hailsham?

673
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,518
Sometimes, yeah.

674
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:25,982
I heard that Amanda completed
on her first donation.

675
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:29,694
I think that happens
more than they ever tell us.

676
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:30,779
Hmm.

677
01:09:30,863 --> 01:09:34,658
Yeah, there was this
guy at my care center

678
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:39,787
who was always really scared of
completing on his first donation.

679
01:09:40,997 --> 01:09:42,790
But it was all fine.

680
01:09:42,874 --> 01:09:45,793
And he's just come
through his third one now,

681
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:49,296
and he's completely
all right.

682
01:09:54,427 --> 01:09:56,554
It's funny,
I don't think...

683
01:09:57,639 --> 01:09:59,723
Well, I know I wouldn't
have been a very good carer,

684
01:09:59,808 --> 01:10:01,851
but in a way I actually
think I'm quite a good donor.

685
01:10:01,935 --> 01:10:04,645
That's what we're
supposed to be, isn't it?

686
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:18,825
I'd like you
to forgive me.

687
01:10:21,453 --> 01:10:23,246
I don't expect
you to.

688
01:10:23,831 --> 01:10:24,956
Forgive you
for what?

689
01:10:32,256 --> 01:10:34,591
For keeping you
and Tommy apart.

690
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:41,763
Should have been you two
together, I always knew it.

691
01:10:41,848 --> 01:10:44,099
As far back
as I can remember.

692
01:10:46,102 --> 01:10:49,521
It wasn't just because of
the rumors about deferrals.

693
01:10:53,985 --> 01:10:56,194
It was because
I was jealous.

694
01:10:58,781 --> 01:11:02,910
You had real love
and I didn't,

695
01:11:06,706 --> 01:11:10,042
and I didn't want to be
the one that was left alone.

696
01:11:21,178 --> 01:11:22,845
It's the worst thing
I ever did.

697
01:11:27,392 --> 01:11:29,727
And now I want
to put it right.

698
01:11:30,103 --> 01:11:31,812
I don't know how you can do that, Ruth.

699
01:11:32,314 --> 01:11:33,731
I can

700
01:11:35,233 --> 01:11:36,901
if you two
get a deferral.

701
01:11:37,903 --> 01:11:40,071
It's too late
for that, Ruth.

702
01:11:40,572 --> 01:11:43,407
Way too late. It's stupid
to even think about it.

703
01:11:43,617 --> 01:11:47,786
It isn't too late. Look,
you'll see, both of you.

704
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:53,083
I wanted to do this trip because I had
something that I wanted to give you.

705
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,419
It's Madame's address.

706
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:03,051
That's who you apply to. That's
who you have to go and see.

707
01:12:05,846 --> 01:12:07,639
How did you
get this?

708
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:13,144
It wasn't easy, but I've had
years to think about what I did.

709
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:17,773
And years to try and work out
a way to make it right.

710
01:13:02,818 --> 01:13:06,029
I started doing them when
we were at The Cottages.

711
01:13:06,196 --> 01:13:08,698
The day after we went
to find Ruth's Possible.

712
01:13:08,824 --> 01:13:11,743
I realized that if I was ever
going to apply for a deferral,

713
01:13:11,827 --> 01:13:14,078
then I'd have to
show them something.

714
01:13:15,497 --> 01:13:18,499
And I've done hundreds
of them over the years.

715
01:13:20,043 --> 01:13:21,710
They're wonderful.

716
01:13:22,503 --> 01:13:24,004
What? Really?

717
01:13:24,255 --> 01:13:25,672
Yeah.

718
01:13:27,258 --> 01:13:28,925
Well, thank you.

719
01:13:41,064 --> 01:13:44,191
I have never showed
anyone them until now.

720
01:13:46,652 --> 01:13:48,737
They were my secret.

721
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:53,199
Just like you and those porno magazines.

722
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:55,618
You remember that?

723
01:13:56,036 --> 01:13:57,119
Yeah.

724
01:13:59,623 --> 01:14:01,540
Ruth said you didn't
understand what I was doing.

725
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,751
No, I don't think she
understood what you were doing.

726
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:05,920
She thought you were
looking at the dirty pictures

727
01:14:06,004 --> 01:14:08,547
in order
to find out about sex

728
01:14:10,634 --> 01:14:14,261
and to find out what you were
missing out on or something.

729
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:19,308
I knew.

730
01:14:20,977 --> 01:14:24,104
I knew you were looking
for your Original.

731
01:14:26,774 --> 01:14:30,568
I used to have these huge
urges to have sex sometimes.

732
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:34,114
And sometimes
they'd be so powerful,

733
01:14:34,657 --> 01:14:36,574
I just thought
I'd do it with anyone.

734
01:14:39,078 --> 01:14:41,913
So I thought that
had to tell me something.

735
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:44,833
Something about the kind
of person I was modeled on.

736
01:14:47,253 --> 01:14:48,920
It's stupid,

737
01:14:50,506 --> 01:14:53,590
but I guessed the magazines would be
the most likely place I'd find her.

738
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,511
You know those urges
are natural, don't you?

739
01:14:57,595 --> 01:15:01,140
You know all of us had them.
You know that now, right?

740
01:15:14,863 --> 01:15:16,613
"From Basrah we sailed,

741
01:15:18,032 --> 01:15:21,785
"day after day, night
after night, over the sea,

742
01:15:22,912 --> 01:15:26,789
"visiting island after island
and land after land,

743
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:31,169
"selling or bartering
our goods at each.

744
01:15:34,756 --> 01:15:39,218
"One day, after some weeks of
sailing out of sight of land,

745
01:15:39,303 --> 01:15:42,013
"we saw an island in the sea
with such fair greenery

746
01:15:42,097 --> 01:15:45,308
"that it appeared like
one of the gardens of Eden.

747
01:15:45,893 --> 01:15:49,312
"At once the captain made
towards this delectable land

748
01:15:49,396 --> 01:15:53,399
"and, when the anchor had been
cast and the ladder lowered,

749
01:15:53,483 --> 01:15:56,319
"allowed his passengers
to disembark. "

750
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:04,659
Don't stop.

751
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:35,388
Ruth got it right. Right
street, right door, everything.

752
01:18:39,894 --> 01:18:43,438
We have to decide which of
my drawings we're gonna take.

753
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:49,486
Just take the best ones.
Maybe six or seven of them.

754
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:51,571
You have to help me.
Yeah, I know.

755
01:18:57,912 --> 01:19:00,747
So, we'll just go there.

756
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:01,873
Mmm.

757
01:19:01,957 --> 01:19:03,625
Next week.

758
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:06,251
I'll take you out for lab tests,
I'll sign you out for the whole day

759
01:19:06,336 --> 01:19:08,045
and we'll visit Madame
on the way back.

760
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:26,855
We're going to do it.

761
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:31,193
I thought you should know.

762
01:19:34,197 --> 01:19:36,073
You're going to apply?

763
01:19:38,826 --> 01:19:40,201
Yes.

764
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:47,375
Good.

765
01:21:50,495 --> 01:21:52,371
Madame?

766
01:21:57,669 --> 01:21:59,086
Sorry.

767
01:21:59,963 --> 01:22:02,172
We didn't mean
to startle you.

768
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,591
We were at Hailsham.

769
01:22:09,347 --> 01:22:11,682
I'm Kathy.
This is Tommy.

770
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:16,519
We're not here to
give you any trouble.

771
01:22:19,982 --> 01:22:21,440
From Hailsham?

772
01:22:21,525 --> 01:22:23,067
We just came
to talk to you.

773
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,196
And I brought you
some things.

774
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:31,075
Some things you might
like for your Gallery.

775
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:34,829
Come inside.

776
01:23:10,323 --> 01:23:12,324
Please, wait here.

777
01:23:30,425 --> 01:23:32,217
Look, it's Hailsham.

778
01:23:33,928 --> 01:23:36,096
Kathy, it's Hailsham.

779
01:23:38,058 --> 01:23:40,768
That's exactly
how I remember it.

780
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:49,484
Please, sit down.

781
01:24:04,792 --> 01:24:06,167
So...

782
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:10,880
We're in love.

783
01:24:11,674 --> 01:24:14,217
And it's true love.
It's verifiable.

784
01:24:15,302 --> 01:24:17,303
Verifiable. I see.

785
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:24,851
Go on.

786
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:26,520
Well,

787
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:30,816
we'd heard about
the deferrals.

788
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:35,779
And we'd worked out the
purpose of The Gallery.

789
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:38,907
Tell me the purpose.

790
01:24:40,702 --> 01:24:43,787
To use our art
from Hailsham

791
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:46,331
to look into
our souls,

792
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:50,794
which would verify that
we deserved a deferral.

793
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:54,880
But the problem is

794
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:57,842
I was a little bit
mixed up back then

795
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:02,138
and I didn't
really do any art,

796
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:06,142
so you never took
anything of mine.

797
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:09,687
I know, I know that
that is my fault

798
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:12,982
and it is probably
much too late,

799
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,067
but I brought some stuff with me today.

800
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:24,117
This is a book
of stuff and...

801
01:25:36,213 --> 01:25:38,256
Other stuff here.

802
01:25:43,053 --> 01:25:46,181
Some of them I've done
quite recently,

803
01:25:47,224 --> 01:25:48,558
and others

804
01:25:50,519 --> 01:25:53,396
were done several years ago,
so there's a real spread.

805
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:57,983
You already have a load
of stuff from Kath already.

806
01:25:58,067 --> 01:26:01,111
She got loads of stuff into The
Gallery over the years, didn't...

807
01:26:01,237 --> 01:26:02,905
I'm sorry.

808
01:26:06,242 --> 01:26:08,202
I never know
what to do.

809
01:26:15,043 --> 01:26:16,919
I'll take it
from here.

810
01:26:22,801 --> 01:26:24,468
Thank you, George.

811
01:26:28,931 --> 01:26:31,349
Kathy H and Tommy D.

812
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:35,061
I remember you both.

813
01:26:35,604 --> 01:26:38,731
Kathy, a bright girl,
and so creative.

814
01:26:39,024 --> 01:26:42,318
And Tommy, a big heart
and terrible rages.

815
01:26:46,573 --> 01:26:48,282
You have to understand,

816
01:26:49,284 --> 01:26:53,871
Hailsham was the last place to
consider the ethics of donation.

817
01:26:54,289 --> 01:26:57,667
We used your art to show
what you were capable of.

818
01:26:58,334 --> 01:27:01,002
To show that donor children
are all but human.

819
01:27:02,839 --> 01:27:06,800
But we were providing an answer
to a question no one was asking.

820
01:27:08,386 --> 01:27:10,595
If you ask people
to return to darkness,

821
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:15,183
the days of lung cancer, breast
cancer, motor neurone disease,

822
01:27:16,143 --> 01:27:18,019
they'll simply say no.

823
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:24,693
We used to get two or three
couples like you a year.

824
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,238
Not so much these days.

825
01:27:29,739 --> 01:27:32,241
You're the first
for quite a while.

826
01:27:36,371 --> 01:27:38,664
To apply
for a deferral?

827
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:49,508
There are
no deferrals, Tommy.

828
01:27:54,514 --> 01:27:58,726
There are no deferrals.
And there never have been.

829
01:28:09,194 --> 01:28:12,947
We didn't have The Gallery in
order to look into your souls.

830
01:28:13,365 --> 01:28:16,576
We had The Gallery to see
if you had souls at all.

831
01:28:29,632 --> 01:28:31,299
Do you understand?

832
01:28:42,185 --> 01:28:43,560
Yes.

833
01:28:50,401 --> 01:28:53,236
Your drawings
are very good.

834
01:28:54,572 --> 01:28:57,074
If you want,
I'll keep them.

835
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:01,636
Thank you
for talking to us.

836
01:30:05,474 --> 01:30:07,224
You poor creatures.

837
01:30:09,019 --> 01:30:10,978
I wish I could help you.

838
01:31:10,912 --> 01:31:13,538
Sorry, can we stop for a
second? I need to get out.

839
01:34:21,346 --> 01:34:23,931
It's been two weeks
since I lost him.

840
01:34:54,545 --> 01:34:56,754
I've been given my notice now.

841
01:35:00,592 --> 01:35:03,261
My first donation
is in a month's time.

842
01:35:11,937 --> 01:35:15,189
I come here and imagine
that this is the spot

843
01:35:15,274 --> 01:35:19,193
where everything I've lost
since my childhood has washed up.

844
01:35:23,156 --> 01:35:26,491
I tell myself
if that were true,

845
01:35:27,327 --> 01:35:29,661
and I waited long enough,

846
01:35:30,747 --> 01:35:34,624
then a tiny figure would appear
on the horizon across the field

847
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:38,754
and gradually get larger
until I'd see it was Tommy.

848
01:35:41,799 --> 01:35:43,383
He'd wave

849
01:35:43,843 --> 01:35:45,719
and maybe call.

850
01:35:48,056 --> 01:35:51,099
I don't let the fantasy
go beyond that.

851
01:35:51,309 --> 01:35:52,642
I can't let it.

852
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:58,773
I remind myself I was lucky to
have had any time with him at all.

853
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:05,571
What I'm not sure about

854
01:36:06,073 --> 01:36:10,659
is if our lives have been so different
from the lives of the people we save.

855
01:36:13,622 --> 01:36:15,539
We all complete.

856
01:36:18,001 --> 01:36:21,712
Maybe none of us really
understand what we've lived through

857
01:36:23,673 --> 01:36:26,216
or feel we've had
enough time.

858
01:42:49,254 --> 01:42:54,675
When we are scattered
afar and asunder

859
01:42:55,010 --> 01:43:00,222
Parted are those
who are singing today

860
01:43:00,807 --> 01:43:06,437
When we look back
and forgetfully wonder

861
01:43:06,938 --> 01:43:12,401
What we were like
in our learning and play

862
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:18,323
Oh, the great days
will bring distance enchanted

863
01:43:18,574 --> 01:43:23,661
Days of fresh air
in the rain and the sun

864
01:43:24,205 --> 01:43:29,542
How we rejoiced
as we struggled and panted

865
01:43:30,002 --> 01:43:36,966
Echoes of dreamland,
Hailsham lives on
