00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,921
<i>Across the field</i>

10
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,932
<i>Through the tunnel we'll go</i>

11
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:58,435
<i>We'll run across the bridge</i>

12
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:02,802
<i>And down the bumpy gravel road</i>

13
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:06,503
<i>Right beneath the spider's web</i>

14
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:07,874

<i>The badgers, too</i>

25
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:42,580
<i>All come out to play</i>

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,208
<i>They all want to explore</i>

27
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:50,651
<i>The deep and wonderful woods all day</i>

28
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:54,316

Thanks.

37
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:34,051
Daddy, want any caramel candy?

38
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:36,813
Thank you. I would. Anybody tired yet?

39
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:37,820
Mm-mmm.

40
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,322
We're almost there.

41
00:02:39,423 --> 00:02:40,685
Good.

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,831
Ohh!

43
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,730
<i>Mai, hide.</i>

44
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,500
I thought he was a policeman.

45
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,339
Hi!

46
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:02,310
Hi!

47
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:03,972
Hello there!

48
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:06,379
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

49
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:23,525
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

50
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:25,226
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

51
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:34,803
Sorry to bother you,
but are your parents around anywhere?

52
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:36,981
They're out there in the field.

53
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:38,674
Thanks a lot.

54
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:41,814
Hello there!

55
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:45,180
<i>Looks like we're going to be neighbors!</i>

56
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,616
Pleasure to meet you.

57
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,318
Good luck in the new house!

58
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:51,157
Thank you! See you soon!

59
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:52,924
Oh!

60
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,961
Thank you very much.

61
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:18,749
Everybody out.

62
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:20,290
Uhh! Ohh!

63
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,586
Hey!

64
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,125
Hang on.

65
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:24,661
There.

66
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,424
Hey, Mai, come over here a minute.

67
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,361
Wow!

68
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,136
What are those little things
swimming around?

69
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:35,405
<i>l don't know.
Goldfish maybe or something?</i>

70
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,598
So do you like it?

71
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,170
<i>It's terrific!</i>

72
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,176
Uh-huh.

73
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,111
<i>Come on, Mai, run!</i>

74
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,240
Wait up!

75
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,317
Wow!

76
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,351
- Can we?
- Mm-hmm.

77
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:49,317
Oh!

78
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,683
Ha ha ha!

79
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:52,786
You be careful, O. K.?

80
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:54,859
<i>Oh, sure. Hee hee hee!</i>

81
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,086
Ha ha ha!

82
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:57,091
- Oh!
- Oh!

83
00:04:57,194 --> 00:04:58,127
Ohh!

84
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,266
What a lot of neat old junk.

85
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:07,000
<i>Do you think it's haunted?</i>

86
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:09,129
Ohh, maybe it is.

87
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,970
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

88
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,601
I bet I can beat you around the house!

89
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:13,678
Wait!

90
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,212
Ooh! Oh!

91
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:17,280
Ooh.

92
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:19,077
Ohh!

93
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,112
It's completely rotten.

94
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,451
<i>Uh-oh, it's gonna fall down</i>

95
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,821
- Ha ha ha!
- Hee hee!

96
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:28,824
Uhh! Uhh!

97
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:30,327
Oh! Hee hee!

98
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:31,293
Ooh!

99
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:32,293
Oh!

100
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:33,796
Hee hee! Aah!

101
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:35,298
Ha ha ha!

102
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,799
Hee hee hee!

103
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:39,132
Ha ha ha!

104
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:42,806
Hey!

105
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,102
Ohh! Whee!

106
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,609
Whoo! Ha ha!

107
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,303
Ha ha ha! Ohh!

108
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:49,504
<i>Wow, Mai, look up!</i>

109
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:51,441
What?

110
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,450
Up there. Look.

111
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:59,350
<i>Wow, what a tree.</i>

112
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,550
It's giant!

113
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,053
<i>That's got to be the biggest tree in -</i>

114
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,059
Ah-choo!

115
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,153
Ha ha ha!

116
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,034
Daddy, look at that big tree
on the mountain!

117
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,934
That s a camphor tree.

118
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,529
Camphor.

119
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,734
Camphor tree!

120
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:18,775
Camphor tree!

121
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,106
Camphor!

122
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,202
Oh.

123
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:28,950
Uhh! Oh!

124
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:32,486
<i>Hey, Mai. . .</i>

125
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,218
Look, an acorn.

126
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:35,224
Huh?

127
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:37,727
<i>But I want a acorn, too.</i>

128
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:39,956
Oh, hey, wait a second.

129
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,965
<i>There's some more over there.</i>

130
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,295
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

131
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,392
I have my own acorn right here.

132
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,227
Huh?

133
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,075
Mai, how am I supposed
to open the house up

134
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:55,168
<i>if you're in the way?</i>

135
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,269
Acorns!

136
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,747
I found a bunch near the back door.

137
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,942
They came from way up.

138
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:03,543
They came out of the ceiling.

139
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:08,390
Hmm. Some squirrels
must have dropped them.

140
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:10,723
- Ohh! Squirrels!
- Ohh! Squirrels!

141
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:13,320
Or maybe some other animal,
perhaps a rat.

142
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,956
But I don't want a dumb rat!

143
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,433
Where am I going to put it?

144
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:19,765
Just bring it here.

145
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,201
I'll open it up for you.

146
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:24,275
<i>Satsuki, open the kitchen door.</i>

147
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,104
Here you go.

148
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,370
<i>Mai, come on.</i>

149
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:28,477
Hey!

150
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:30,479
Wait!

151
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,516
<i>Hey, wait up!</i>

152
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,053
<i>You can't catch me</i>

153
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:37,280
<i>Can, too.</i>

154
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:58,134
hh!

155
00:07:58,243 --> 00:07:59,302
Oh.

156
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:08,717
- Aah!
- Aah!

157
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,421
Hmm.

158
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:14,492
Ready?

159
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:15,923
Mm-hmm.

160
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:27,737
Bathtubs.

161
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,828
Great.

162
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,177
Nothing up there.

163
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,339
No.

164
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:37,608
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

165
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:39,115
Bathtubs are in there.

166
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:41,013
We saw something move in there.

167
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,108
A squirrel?

168
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,186
<i>We're not sure.</i>

169
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,755
<i>Maybe they were cockroaches,</i>

170
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,552
but there were millions of them.

171
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:47,784
Hmm.

172
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,785
Lots of little black things.

173
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:02,439
See anything?

174
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,667
<i>Well, I'm pretty sure
they were dust bunnies.</i>

175
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:07,644
Real dust bunnies,
like in my picture book?

176
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,237
Dust bunnies make more sense
than ghosts.

177
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,747
Why?

178
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:14,118
Uhh!

179
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,880
Ghosts are harder to see.

180
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:18,420
<i>When you suddenly move
from a lighted room to darkness,</i>

181
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:22,051
<i>you can't see for a second.
That's when dust bunnies come out.</i>

182
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,253
Boy. Yeah.

183
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,761
Come out! Come out!

184
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,764
- Come out!
- Come on out!

185
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,299
Come out! Come out!

186
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:30,766
Come out! Come out!

187
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,461
Come out, dust bunnies!

188
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,471
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

189
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,830
Let's get to work.

190
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:41,003
We have to find the steps
that lead up to the attic.

191
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:42,203
What?

192
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:43,611
Find the way up.

193
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:46,412
<i>We'll open all the windows upstairs.</i>

194
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:47,109
Yeah!

195
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:48,708
<i>Hey, wait for me.</i>

196
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,789
Ha ha.

197
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,385
No stairs.

198
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:01,631
No.

199
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:05,701
Nothing here.

200
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:06,998
Nothing here.

201
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,170
Nope. Nothing there.

202
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,403
Ha ha ha!
Nothing there.

203
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:14,808
Hee hee hee!

204
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:15,811
Ow.

205
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,246
Nobody in this room.

206
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,908
Nobody here!

207
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,319
- Hi!
- Ha ha ha!

208
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,386
Hey!

209
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:24,216
Ha ha ha!

210
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,983
Ohh!

211
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,595
<i>Come here, Mai! I found it!</i>

212
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,190
Hee hee hee!

213
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,167
Wow.

214
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,433
Someone up there?

215
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,667
Catch some ghosts upstairs?

216
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,209
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

217
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,538
<i>It's an acorn.</i>

218
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:51,143
Uh-oh.

219
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,841
Uhh!

220
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:54,074
They must like them.

221
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:04,361
Little dust bunnies,
go away right now!

222
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:10,832
Oh.

223
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:12,527
Heh heh heh.

224
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,003
Hmm.

225
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:31,014
- Aah!
- Aah!

226
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:32,521
Aah.

227
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,526
<i>Don't be scared, Mai.
There's nothing to be afraid of.</i>

228
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,230
<i>There's nobody here.</i>

229
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:50,942
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

230
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:54,341
Aah!

231
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:55,936
Oh.

232
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,122
Ohh!

233
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:07,587
There.

234
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,324
<i>That's it. Easy.</i>

235
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:12,623
Slowly.

236
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,254
Guess what.

237
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:16,424
Something's really living upstairs
after all!

238
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,627
<i>That's wonderful. Good for you.</i>

239
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:21,136
<i>I've always wanted
to have a haunted house.</i>

240
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,105
<i>It's been my lifelong dream.</i>

241
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:23,799
Uhh!

242
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:24,806
Careful!

243
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:25,807
Oh!

244
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,571
Ooh!

245
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:53,427
Aah!

246
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,448
<i>Guess what, Sis! I got one!</i>

247
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,126
Uhh!

248
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:27,397
Eh?

249
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:28,802
Aah!

250
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:31,365
Mai?

251
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:34,810
Oh.

252
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:35,880
Aah!

253
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,012
Huh!

254
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,013
Whoo whoo!

255
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:39,481
Ah! Ah! Ah.

256
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,052
Two fine kids.

257
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,056
<i>There's nothing to be frightened about.
Nanny has the farm next door.</i>

258
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,146
She's helping us out.

259
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,752
<i>Nanny, this is Mai, my sister,</i>

260
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,090
<i>and I'm Satsuki.</i>

261
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,824
Very pleased to meet both of you.

262
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:58,426
<i>lf I'd known
what a hurry you were in to move,</i>

263
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:00,561
I would've cleaned the house up.

264
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,433
<i>It really isn't necessary.</i>

265
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:05,508
Aah!

266
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,741
I've been so busy
in the rice paddies lately. . .

267
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:12,645
How did you get all that black on you?

268
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,945
I had a dust bunny right in my hand.

269
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:17,181
<i>Ohh! Mai, your feet!</i>

270
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,184
Uh-oh.

271
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,190
To do a little dusting. . .

272
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,123
<i>You got mine black, too!</i>

273
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:24,957
Eh?

274
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,299
Aha!

275
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:34,363
It appears the soot sprites
are hard at work.

276
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,963
What are they?

277
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,974
You mean those black little fuzzy things

278
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:41,273
that fly around and disappear upstairs?

279
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,650
Yes. They breed
in very old empty houses,

280
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:49,278
building invisible nests
and turning everything into dust.

281
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,817
<i>l could see them, too,
when I was a very small child.</i>

282
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,521
That you two are able to see them
makes me very glad.

283
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:00,030
<i>It couldn't have been a spirit,
could it?</i>

284
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,599
<i>If they're not sprites,</i>

285
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:03,963
then you have nothing
to be frightened about.

286
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:07,765
lf we keep smiling,
the sprites may gradually go away

287
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,431
and leave this place alone.

288
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:13,139
<i>Yes. I'm sure that
somewhere up in that ceiling</i>

289
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,442
they're busily discussing plans
for leaving the house.

290
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,579
Maybe they really will leave us alone.

291
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,087
<i>What's wrong with them?</i>

292
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:26,656
With dust bunnies all over the house?

293
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,351
<i>I'm not afraid of dust bunnies.</i>

294
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:32,328
Maybe you can go to the bathroom
by yourself at night.

295
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,523
Ha ha ha!

296
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:37,123
Come. The house needs cleaning up.

297
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,260
Fetch a bucket and go get some water.

298
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,630
From the stream?

299
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:42,262
<i>Maybe we'll catch a fish!</i>

300
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,864
- Ha ha ha!
- Hee hee hee!

301
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:47,768
<i>You wait here, O. K.?</i>

302
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,723
Did you get any fish?

303
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,734
Ha ha!

304
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,497
<i>It's coming out!
It's coming out, Nanny!</i>

305
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:15,129
Good. Very good.

306
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,470
Just keep at it
till the water gets cold.

307
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,542
Right.

308
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,576
Ha!

309
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:20,665
Ha!

310
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:21,745
Oh.

311
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:01,109
Huh!

312
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,779
<i>Hey, is that for us?
Is that for me?</i>

313
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,754
Tell me what your name is.

314
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,121
<i>Uh, it's for Grandma.</i>

315
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,694
Huh?

316
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,353
Grandma?

317
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:13,862
Yuh-uh-uh.

318
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,698
Hmm?

319
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,789
Mmm!

320
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:17,792
Yuh-uh!

321
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,131
<i>Hey, wait up! Where you going?</i>

322
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:22,028
<i>Kanta, don't be silly.</i>

323
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,200
<i>Hey, haven't you heard?</i>

324
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,938
You re living in a haunted house!

325
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:30,446
- Ohh!
- Go away!

326
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,210
Yuh-uh!

327
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,047
Ehhhh!

328
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,050
Ha ha ha!

329
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:43,287
l remember doing that
when I was his age.

330
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:47,391
l hate boys, but I love Nanny's food
better than anything else

331
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,056
in the whole wide world.

332
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,665
Eat all you want.

333
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,399
Thanks for your help!

334
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:54,835
Bye!

335
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,565
<i>Thank you so much, Nanny.</i>

336
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:01,506
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

337
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:40,475
Aah! Oh!

338
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,653
<i>I'm scared the wind's going
to make the house fall down.</i>

339
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:24,690
Maybe it will, but I hope not
because we just moved in.

340
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:25,693
Huh?

341
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:26,763
- Hmm?
- Ohh!

342
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,616
Aah!

343
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,019
- Ha ha ha!
- Ohh!

344
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,723
Come on. What are you waiting for?

345
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:03,459
You have to laugh loud
to scare a spirit.

346
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,195
Ha ha ha!

347
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,965
<i>I'm not scared at all.</i>

348
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,733
Uh huh ha ha.

349
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,739
I'm not! I mean it!

350
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:13,140
Aah! Ha ha ha!

351
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,737
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

352
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,337
Aah!

353
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:22,779
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

354
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:32,527
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

355
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,244
1, 2.

356
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,116
1, 2.

357
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:56,812
1, 2.

358
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,152
That's it. Give it all you got.

359
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:00,918
Come on. Yeah.

360
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,784
There we go.

361
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,733
<i>Well, if I may humbly say so,
we're finished.</i>

362
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,165
- Yay!
- Yay!

363
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,105
Uhh! There we are.

364
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,200
<i>Get ready to fly, Mai!</i>

365
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:22,273
Better hold on!

366
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,348
- Aah!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

367
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:27,076
Here we go!

368
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:39,786
Nanny!

369
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,396
Hi!

370
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,264
Hello!

371
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,002
Where are you pedaling off to
this morning?

372
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,205
<i>We're going to visit Mommy
in the hospital!</i>

373
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,004
<i>Well, be sure to give my regards!</i>

374
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,172
I know she'll be very happy to see you!

375
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,213
Bye-bye.

376
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,138
Ehhhh!

377
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,809
Ehhhh!

378
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,947
Nyehhh!

379
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,326
<i>That way, Daddy! That way!</i>

380
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,526
- Ooh. Oh, oh.
- Ha ha ha!

381
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,160
Good afternoon.

382
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,660
- Good afternoon.
- Ohh!

383
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,162
Hee hee hee!

384
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,563
Mommy!

385
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,691
<i>My love, I'm so happy to see you.</i>

386
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,792
Daddy took the wrong road.
We had to come another way.

387
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,372
<i>Well. Don't be shy.</i>

388
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,270
We got off today from school.

389
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,399
Wonderful.

390
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,502
<i>Daddy said to tell you he'll be here.</i>

391
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,479
<i>He's probably speaking to the doctor.</i>

392
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,516
It's good to see you all.

393
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,553
Do you like the new house?

394
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,312
Yeah.

395
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,916
Ohh! You mean they live upstairs?

396
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:14,616
Mm-hmm.

397
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,092
Do you like fuzzy spirits, Mommy?

398
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:20,755
Yes. I wish I could go see them now.

399
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,025
You were right, Mai.

400
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,293
Mm-hmm.

401
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,700
We thought you might not be happy
about the house having spooks.

402
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,204
Are you happy with them?

403
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,203
Yep.

404
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,103
<i>I'm not afraid of them.</i>

405
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,705
<i>Don't tell me
you fixed Mai's ponytails by yourself.</i>

406
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:36,712
Mm-hmm.

407
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,749
<i>They're beautiful.</i>

408
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:41,113
<i>You know, you're a very lucky girl.</i>

409
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:42,982
She always gets mad at me.

410
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,215
<i>That's because
you re always jumping around.</i>

411
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,313
<i>Satsuki, come here.</i>

412
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,484
<i>Why don't you let me brush your hair?</i>

413
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,220
<i>I'm glad it's short.</i>

414
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,728
I want mine short.

415
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,059
When you re my age.

416
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,566
<i>Satsuki, you have wire for hair,</i>

417
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,330
as stubborn as mine when I was small.

418
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,768
<i>I'll be able to have hair
as beautiful as yours</i>

419
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:03,568
<i>when I'm older, right?</i>

420
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,109
Yes. I know that

421
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,272
because you look exactly like me
when I was young.

422
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:13,378
Hi.

423
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,484
<i>Da da da-da da da</i>

424
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,388
<i>Da da da-duh</i>

425
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,518
<i>Da da da-da da da da-da</i>

426
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,889
<i>Da da-duh. . .</i>

427
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,396
I thought Mommy looked a lot better.

428
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,333
l think the doctor
might let her leave shortly.

429
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,564
Does that mean tomorrow, Daddy?

430
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,832
<i>Aw, tomorrow means tomorrow.</i>

431
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,772
Maybe not tomorrow,
but it's pretty soon.

432
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,539
<i>She said when she comes,
she'll only sleep in my bed.</i>

433
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,547
You said you were big enough
to sleep by yourself.

434
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,810
Mommy told me it would be O. K.

435
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,047
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

436
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,351
<i>Da da da-duh</i>

437
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,552
<i>La la la la</i>

438
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,439
Daddy!

439
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,934
<i>Daddy, wake up!</i>

440
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,169
It's morning!

441
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,678
Ohh.

442
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,169
<i>Daddy, get up.</i>

443
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,179
Uhh!

444
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,182
It's Mai!

445
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,582
Hee hee hee!

446
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:24,478
Good morning.

447
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,454
I must have overslept.

448
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,458
We get our lunch boxes today.

449
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,858
<i>I'm sorry. I completely forgot.</i>

450
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,521
I made lunch for everybody.

451
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,791
<i>Hey, it's burning.</i>

452
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,764
Just a minute!

453
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,232
<i>O. K. , this one's for you.</i>

454
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,738
<i>That one's mine.</i>

455
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,272
Mai, stop that. Sit down and eat.

456
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,641
Go ahead. Wrap it yourself.

457
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,912
Ahh.

458
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,040
Hey!

459
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,483
<i>You're late!</i>

460
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,816
Must be time to go.

461
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,619
O. K.!

462
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,125
<i>l can't believe
you've made a friend already.</i>

463
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,196
Bet you sit next to her in class.

464
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,488
<i>Yep, and her name's Michiko.</i>

465
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,226
Ahh.

466
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,231
Here I come!

467
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,773
- Thanks for saying goodbye!
- Thanks for saying goodbye!

468
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,608
Hi. Sorry.

469
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,407
<i>Why'd you take so long?
We're going to be late.</i>

470
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,813
Ahh. . .

471
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,414
Uhmmm!

472
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,720
Daddy, this hat!

473
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,693
Am I a grownup if I wear it?

474
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,855
It looks that way.
Where are you going?

475
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,229
Going to get some flowers.

476
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,481
Is it lunchtime yet?

477
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,423
<i>I don't think so!</i>

478
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,459
Hmm.

479
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,537
Daddy, look. I'm the flower lady.

480
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,270
Heh heh heh.

481
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,288
Golly, wollypogs.

482
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,830
Hmm.

483
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,038
<i>There's no bottom.</i>

484
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,775
Huh?

485
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,982
Wow.

486
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,719
Acorn.

487
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,295
Dust bunnies.

488
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,062
Hey.

489
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,239
Huh?

490
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,284
Ha ha ha ha!

491
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,427
Ha ha ha!

492
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,460
Come back!

493
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,547
Aha!

494
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,547
Hmm?

495
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,222
Aah!

496
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,788
Hey.

497
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:28,066
Ah-choo!

498
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,333
Ha!

499
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,824
Hmm?

500
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,449
Hmm.

501
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,028
Tell me who you are.

502
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,623
Are you a big dust bunny?

503
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,599
No.

504
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,069
<i>I'm. . .</i>

505
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:12,580
Waah!

506
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,551
To. . .

507
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,589
To. . .

508
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,489
Ro!

509
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:23,491
Totoro?

510
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,889
That's it.

511
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,794
<i>I bet your name's Totoro, isn't it?</i>

512
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,801
<i>So you're really a Totoro.</i>

513
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,438
Totoro.

514
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,144
<i>Sure, I will. Tomorrow.</i>

515
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,908
- O. K. Bye.
- See you later.

516
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,216
<i>Daddy, I'm home.</i>

517
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,146
Already?

518
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,242
<i>Wait. How come you're home so late?</i>

519
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,513
I was playing with Michiko.

520
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,519
<i>Where's Mai?</i>

521
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,922
<i>l haven't even eaten lunch.
I think Mai's out back.</i>

522
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,857
Mai!

523
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,552
Mai!

524
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,122
Mai?

525
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,730
Mai?

526
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,404
Daddy, over here!

527
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,945
I think I know where Mai went.

528
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:35,184
Mai?

529
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:36,591
Mai!

530
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,627
Wake up!

531
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:38,593
Wake up.

532
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:48,831
<i>Wake up, Mai! Right now!</i>

533
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,302
You have no business
sleeping in this place.

534
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:55,309
<i>How come he's gone?</i>

535
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:56,904
<i>How come who's gone?</i>

536
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,310
Tell me who you lost.

537
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:04,980
A big Totoro was here with me.

538
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,184
A big one like
what's in our picture books?

539
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,190
Mm-hmm.

540
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,819
<i>And I climbed up on top of him,</i>

541
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,558
<i>and he was furry,
and he had a big mouth,</i>

542
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:19,227
and there was a little one
and one this big

543
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,398
and a great big one sleeping by himself.

544
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:23,996
Uh-huh?

545
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:27,567
Hello! Is anybody in there?

546
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,679
Well, I'll be.

547
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,577
What a great hiding place.

548
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:35,118
Daddy, Mai told me
she saw a big Totoro.

549
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,812
A real one?

550
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:37,820
Mm-hmm.

551
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,049
This way.

552
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,656
Ha ha!

553
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,490
Hey, give me a chance.

554
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,098
Here?

555
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:56,435
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

556
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,032
He was by the big tree
a little while ago.

557
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,612
I don't see how he could've escaped.

558
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:04,972
<i>Mai! Mai, come back!</i>

559
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,057
Ha ha ha!

560
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,357
Ha ha ha ha!

561
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,396
Stop laughing!

562
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,467
I really saw him. I m not lying.

563
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,093
I'm not lying.

564
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,478
Mai.

565
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,710
You don't believe me.

566
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,307
<i>Mm-hmm. That's where you're wrong.</i>

567
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:43,115
<i>l believe you're being
completely truthful about this.</i>

568
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:46,987
But I also believe that you met
the king of the forest.

569
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,083
Meeting him is a sign of good luck.

570
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:53,926
<i>There's no guarantee
you'll see him all the time.</i>

571
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,522
<i>We'll have to pay our respects.</i>

572
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:57,499
Where do we find him?

573
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:00,366
Miss Mai will find him for us.

574
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:15,441
Oh!

575
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,781
<i>Ohh, Mai, you're getting heavier
by the minute.</i>

576
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,686
Daddy, the camphor tree.

577
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,857
What a beautiful tree.

578
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,068
I found it.

579
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,599
<i>You sure that's the one?</i>

580
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,866
Uh-huh.

581
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,534
What are you waiting for, Daddy?
Hurry up.

582
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,709
<i>The hole's not there anymore,</i>

583
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,821
but I'm sure this is where it was.

584
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,412
You're positive it is?

585
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:53,786
Mm-hmm.

586
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,883
<i>The opening's completely disappeared.</i>

587
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,656
Remember, you can see him
only when he wants you to.

588
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:01,426
Will we see him? I want to meet him.

589
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:05,031
<i>You never can tell.
If we're lucky enough.</i>

590
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,135
What a beautiful tree it is.

591
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,836
This tree's been here,
well, since before anyone can remember.

592
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:15,172
<i>You know, a long time ago,</i>

593
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,512
Man and trees were the best of friends.

594
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:24,618
<i>It's actually because of this tree
that I decided to buy our house,</i>

595
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:27,157
<i>and Mommy will like it, too.</i>

596
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,626
Let's thank the king of the forest
and get back for lunch.

597
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:33,425
I have to meet Michiko after lunch.

598
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:34,624
<i>I'm coming, too.</i>

599
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,758
Attention!

600
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,093
Thank you for all you've done for Mai.

601
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:41,764
Please protect her forever.

602
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,602
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

603
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,272
Last one home's a rotten egg.

604
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:48,005
No fair! You cheated!

605
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,013
Wait!

606
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,147
Hey!

607
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,909
<i>Hey, wait up!</i>

608
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,143
<i>"Dear Mother,</i>

609
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,554
<i>You're never going to believe this,</i>

610
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,059
<i>but today, under that giant tree,</i>

611
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,618
<i>Mai actually met a ghost, Totoro.</i>

612
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:09,062
<i>Daddy says
it was the king of the forest.</i>

613
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:13,467
<i>Well, whoever he was,
I really want to meet him."</i>

614
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:48,004
<i>Kanta, you'd better hurry up,
or you'll be late.</i>

615
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:48,697
O. K.

616
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:22,532
There.

617
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,338
Huh?

618
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,614
Mai? What. . .

619
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,309
Excuse me.

620
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:35,818
<i>Yes, Satsuki?</i>

621
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,151
<i>I-i-it's my sister Mai.</i>

622
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,456
<i>What's she going to do?</i>

623
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,963
Nanny! Nanny, what happened?

624
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:51,660
Dear, I'm sorry,
but she demanded to be with her sister.

625
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,265
<i>But I'm going to be -</i>

626
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,772
Mai, you promised to be a good girl

627
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,741
<i>because Daddy's at the university
and can't take care of you.</i>

628
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,239
<i>l have a couple hours left
before I can come home,</i>

629
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,010
and Nanny's been very nice to watch you.

630
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:09,986
Our Mai has been a very good girl.

631
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,075
Eh?

632
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,990
Well, I better ask permission
for her to come inside.

633
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,932
<i>Because her mother's going to be
in the hospital,</i>

634
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:33,636
Satsuki will be taking care
of her sister Mai.

635
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,234
Is that clear?

636
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:36,540
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

637
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,614
<i>What's that a picture of, Mai?</i>

638
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:45,212
A Totoro picture.

639
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:46,722
Shh!

640
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,257
Could you be a little more
quiet about it?

641
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:00,935
Bye-bye.

642
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,335
Want to come over and play?

643
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,773
I might miss the club meeting.

644
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:07,071
Come whenever you can.

645
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:08,076
Bye, Mai.

646
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,077
Goodbye.

647
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,808
<i>We'd better walk fast,
or we're going to get wet.</i>

648
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,214
O. K.

649
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,391
Oh, no! Hurry!

650
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:31,299
Oh!

651
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:32,803
Oh, my god.

652
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,303
Are you O. K.?

653
00:44:34,406 --> 00:44:34,997
Yeah.

654
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,506
Come on.

655
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,614
Wow. What do we do now?

656
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:52,915
<i>lf it's not too much trouble,
could we stay until it stops raining?</i>

657
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:34,863
Uh. . .

658
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,731
Thanks.

659
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,327
Uh. . .

660
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,213
Ha ha.

661
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,243
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

662
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,156
<i>We were pretty lucky, huh?</i>

663
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:04,286
<i>Ha ha! That's funny.
It's got holes in it.</i>

664
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,034
Uh-oh. Daddy left his umbrella.

665
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,938
Hey, we could bring it back to him.

666
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,742
I just forgot because I forgot.

667
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,783
How can you forget your umbrella

668
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:26,781
<i>when it's raining?</i>

669
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:29,512
<i>Even you can't be that stupid.</i>

670
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:31,713
You probably broke it in half.

671
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,346
I did not!

672
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,224
Hmm?

673
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,229
Y-y-yii!

674
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,468
Excuse me. Is anybody home?

675
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:52,334
<i>Satsuki, what are you doing here?</i>

676
00:46:52,444 --> 00:46:54,070
Grandma.

677
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,637
Thank you for taking care of Mai.

678
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,942
Don't be ridiculous.
She was a treasure.

679
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,452
We wanted to bring back
the umbrella we borrowed.

680
00:47:02,554 --> 00:47:04,249
<i>But - Kanta's umbrella?</i>

681
00:47:04,356 --> 00:47:06,290
Why would he give you
this beat-up thing?

682
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,850
<i>We didn't have one,
but I'm afraid he got soaking wet.</i>

683
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,657
<i>Anyway, please thank him for us.</i>

684
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,664
<i>l will.
I'm always telling him to wash,</i>

685
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,666
so rain did him no harm.

686
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,326
Are you on your way to meet your father?

687
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:21,166
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

688
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:22,933
Give him my regards.

689
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,905
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

690
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,215
Hee hee hee!

691
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:37,216
Did someone come to the door?

692
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:38,288
<i>I didn't hear anything.</i>

693
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,454
<i>Oh, boy, we made it!</i>

694
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:54,464
Thank you.

695
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,261
Thank you.

696
00:47:57,342 --> 00:47:58,968
Getting onboard or not?

697
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:02,974
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

698
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,653
<i>Daddy wasn't on that one, right?</i>

699
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:14,748
<i>I'm sure he'll be on the next one.</i>

700
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:17,727
<i>Want to go back to Nanny's house
and wait?</i>

701
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,524
<i>What's the matter?</i>

702
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,061
<i>Mai, you re sleepy.</i>

703
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:27,823
Uh-uh.

704
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:31,834
I told you it might be a while.

705
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:34,462
<i>You don't want to go to Nanny's
and wait?</i>

706
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:38,404
<i>I'm sure the bus will come soon.</i>

707
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,535
Just hang in there.

708
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:45,510
<i>Well, I guess they were delayed,</i>

709
00:49:45,617 --> 00:49:47,049
but I hope not.

710
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,656
Come on.

711
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,176
Uhhh. . .

712
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:22,745
I bet you re Totoro.

713
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:33,487
Oh, we have another umbrella
if you want.

714
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,457
Go ahead. Take it.

715
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,828
<i>Come on. I'm going to drop Mai.</i>

716
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,899
You put it over your head like that.

717
00:52:52,437 --> 00:52:53,425
Aah!

718
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,443
Huh?

719
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:05,538
Huh?

720
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:09,017
The bus is here.

721
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:29,234
- Oh!
- Oh!

722
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:20,187
Mai, wa-wasn't that umbrella
he took with him Daddy's?

723
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,729
Thank you.

724
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,997
How nice of you to meet me.

725
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:36,073
Daddy!

726
00:54:36,174 --> 00:54:38,267
<i>I'm sorry, but the train was late.</i>

727
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:39,866
<i>That's why I missed the first bus.</i>

728
00:54:39,978 --> 00:54:42,538
<i>You weren't worried, were you?</i>

729
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:44,911
l saw him!
He was right beside me!

730
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:46,882
<i>Me, too!</i>

731
00:54:46,985 --> 00:54:48,384
Uh. . . uh. . .

732
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,850
Oh, and gigantic arms.

733
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,386
Great big eyeballs, too.

734
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,853
It was scary.

735
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,446
I was scared.

736
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:58,761
We saw Totoro! We saw Totoro!

737
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,352
<i>We saw Totoro</i>

738
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,276
Hey, anyone want a ride?

739
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:14,276
I do!

740
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:16,108
O. K. , here we go!

741
00:55:16,948 --> 00:55:18,108
Whee!

742

<i>"Dear Mother, I'm surprised
I can write to you at all</i>

beating so fast,</i>

incredible happen today.</i>

745
00:55:29,928 --> 00:55:31,395
<i>We both met Totoro,</i>

746
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:33,327
<i>I really saw him.</i>

747
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:35,331
<i>He even gave us a gift.</i>

748
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:37,901
<i>It was a package
wrapped up in bamboo leaves</i>

749
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,366
<i>and tied with dragon whiskers.</i>

750

<i>We opened it immediately.</i>

<i>Guess what was in it!
Magic nuts and seeds."</i>

752
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:46,505
- Oh!
- Oh!

753
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:47,908

<i>Mai just. . .</i>

I mean will they come out tomorrow?

773
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:33,822
That's tough to say.

774
00:56:33,925 --> 00:56:36,485
Perhaps Totoro will be able to say
if they will.

775
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,322
Good night.

776

Ahh. . .

Hey!

824
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:58,536
About how ripe is this?

825
01:02:58,643 --> 01:03:00,201
That's ripe.

826

Wow.

01:03:06,117 --> 01:03:09,109
Your vegetable garden

828
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,916
Thanks to Mother Nature.

829

<i>Let's take a little rest, shall we?</i>

830
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:21,421
There we are,
nice and cold.

831
01:03:21,533 --> 01:03:23,364
Michiko will be jealous.

832
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:27,935
Mmm.

833
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:33,770
<i>It's amazing.</i>

834
01:03:33,878 --> 01:03:35,813
<i>They've absorbed
lots of wonderful things</i>

835
01:03:35,914 --> 01:03:36,846
from the sun.

836
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:40,144
That's what makes them so good
for the body and the soul.

837
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:41,912
Would they help my mother?

838
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:43,418
Of course they would.

839
01:03:43,521 --> 01:03:47,481
My vegetable garden is bound
to make anyone feel better.

840
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,321
Our mother s coming home this week
from the hospital.

01:03:50,428 --> 01:03:52,692
<i>She'll sleep with me under my cover.</i>

842
01:03:52,797 --> 01:03:54,594
<i>That's wonderful.</i>

843
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:56,166
<i>She s able to come back, is she?</i>

844
01:03:56,267 --> 01:03:58,599
She's coming home
to spend a couple of days

845
01:03:58,703 --> 01:04:01,069
but has to go right back there.

846
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:02,662
I suppose she has to be careful.

847
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:04,172
<i>Yes, she has.</i>

848
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:07,176
We'll fatten her up
on my fresh vegetables.

849
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:09,109
<i>I'm giving Mommy this corn</i>

850
01:04:09,214 --> 01:04:11,114
I picked for her specially.

851
01:04:11,216 --> 01:04:14,117
<i>I'm sure she'll love you for it.</i>

852
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:15,207
Mm-hmm.

853
01:04:22,093 --> 01:04:23,583
Mailman gave me this telegram

854
01:04:23,695 --> 01:04:25,662
because you were out. Here.

855
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:32,193
<i>But Daddy won't be home from
the university till after 9 :OO.</i>

856
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:33,703
Open it now then.

857
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:35,794
A telegram is serious business.

858
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:37,806
Mm-hmm.

859
01:04:38,977 --> 01:04:41,604
<i>It's from my mother's doctor
at the hospital.</i>

860
01:04:41,713 --> 01:04:42,941
"Please contact me."

861
01:04:43,048 --> 01:04:44,572
What's that supposed to mean?

862
01:04:44,683 --> 01:04:46,582
Is something wrong or not?

863
01:04:46,685 --> 01:04:48,481
l know something awful s
happened to her.

864
01:04:50,355 --> 01:04:53,085
What am I supposed to do
if my father s not home?

865
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,557
Have you any way
of telephoning your father?

866
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,526
I have the number of his research lab,

867
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,461
but we don't have a telephone.

868
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,658
Take them to your mother's place.

869
01:05:03,768 --> 01:05:05,395
Let them use the phone.
Do you understand?

870
01:05:05,503 --> 01:05:08,098
<i>Don t panic, but go quickly.</i>

871
01:05:09,874 --> 01:05:12,571
<i>Mai, you make sure
you stay put at my house!</i>

872
01:05:12,676 --> 01:05:13,665
Mai!

873
01:05:13,778 --> 01:05:15,405
Mai!

874
01:05:21,653 --> 01:05:23,746
<i>Hey, Mai, don't follow me!</i>

875
01:05:23,854 --> 01:05:25,822
Go to Nanny's house.

876
01:05:32,897 --> 01:05:33,864
Oh.

877
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:02,320
<i>Hello, Operator.</i>

878
01:06:02,427 --> 01:06:04,486
I'd like to make
a long-distance call, please.

879
01:06:04,596 --> 01:06:05,995
It's very important.

880
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:08,530
It's number 1354 at Station 12.

881
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:09,496
Yes.

882
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:11,000
Thank you very much.

883
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:12,591
Your friend is very pretty.

884
01:06:12,704 --> 01:06:14,034
What lovely hair.

885
01:06:16,574 --> 01:06:18,007
Hello.

886
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:19,234
Yes.

887
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,839
Can you put me through
to the Main lecture room

888
01:06:21,946 --> 01:06:23,379
of the Anthropology School?

889
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,005
To Professor Kusakabe.
Please hurry.

890
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,848
<i>Yes, yes.
I'm his daughter.</i>

891
01:06:31,755 --> 01:06:33,815
<i>It was from the hospital, Daddy.
I'm so worried.</i>

892
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:35,824
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

893
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:39,826
<i>From the hospital?
Oh, O. K. It's all right.</i>

894
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,329
<i>I think I understand.</i>

895
01:06:41,433 --> 01:06:43,025
<i>Now, I'm going to call the hospital.</i>

896
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:45,328
What's happened to Mommy?

897
01:06:45,437 --> 01:06:47,063
<i>There's no need to worry.</i>

898
01:06:47,172 --> 01:06:51,073
<i>I'll check with the hospital
and call you right back, O. K.?</i>

899
01:06:51,176 --> 01:06:51,767
Uh-huh.

900
01:06:51,876 --> 01:06:53,503
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

901
01:06:53,611 --> 01:06:55,442
I'm hanging up,
so you stay right there.

902
01:06:57,649 --> 01:06:59,241
He'll be calling back.
So is it all right

903
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:01,443
if I stay here
by the telephone and wait?

904
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,250
You take all the time you need.

905
01:07:11,363 --> 01:07:14,092
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

906
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:16,697
Uh-oh.

907
01:07:22,474 --> 01:07:23,462
Oh, no!

908
01:07:23,575 --> 01:07:25,440
<i>I'm giving this to my Mommy!</i>

909
01:07:27,112 --> 01:07:28,078
Go away!

910
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:30,773
You just better stop it right now!

911
01:07:46,431 --> 01:07:50,231
<i>Mai, the hospital said
that Mommy's condition isn't very good,</i>

912
01:07:50,335 --> 01:07:53,065
so she won't be coming home just yet.

913
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:54,159
But why?

914
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,901
<i>Mai, what can we do?</i>

915
01:07:57,007 --> 01:07:59,032
<i>lf she came home now,
it'd make it worse.</i>

916
01:07:59,144 --> 01:08:01,043
It would not!

917
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,275
But she'll be able
to come home real soon.

918
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:06,281
No!

919
01:08:07,352 --> 01:08:09,547
<i>All right then! Be that way!
Let's see if she dies!</i>

920
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:11,587
No!

921
01:08:12,022 --> 01:08:13,080
<i>Don't be dumb, Mai!</i>

922
01:08:13,191 --> 01:08:14,556
<i>Oh, I give up!</i>

923
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:16,183
<i>You're so stupid!</i>

924
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,591
Come on, Mai.

925
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,531
Waah!

926
01:08:29,641 --> 01:08:32,576
<i>I'm not stupid!</i>

927
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:33,768
Waah!

928
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:03,663
I took care of the rest of the washing.

929
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,001
Come on, now.

930
01:09:07,112 --> 01:09:09,580
It isn't the end of the world.

931
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:11,581
<i>Your old Nanny's here to help.</i>

932
01:09:11,683 --> 01:09:14,174
Let's see that beautiful smile.

933
01:09:15,954 --> 01:09:17,750
<i>Your father's stopping off
at the hospital</i>

934
01:09:17,856 --> 01:09:19,687
<i>on his way home, eh?</i>

935
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,680
What I heard was that your mother

936
01:09:21,793 --> 01:09:24,728
only caught a small cold.

937
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:27,023
<i>She'll be home next weekend,
I believe.</i>

938
01:09:27,132 --> 01:09:30,329
That s what they said last time, too.

939
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,327
<i>"It'll be a little visit,</i>

940
01:09:33,438 --> 01:09:35,338
<i>just a few days
to see what's wrong with her.</i>

941
01:09:36,007 --> 01:09:37,941
<i>It's just a cold."</i>

942
01:09:39,244 --> 01:09:41,439
What are me and Mai going to do
if Mommy dies?

943
01:09:41,546 --> 01:09:43,446
Uh, uh. . .

944
01:09:44,015 --> 01:09:46,142
<i>What are we going to do, Nanny?</i>

945
01:09:50,455 --> 01:09:52,786
There, there.

946
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,759
<i>Don't worry.</i>

947
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,021
<i>Your mother's not going to die.</i>

948
01:09:59,129 --> 01:10:00,323
Hush.

949
01:10:00,432 --> 01:10:02,559
<i>She'd never leave
two such beautiful children.</i>

950
01:10:02,667 --> 01:10:05,067
She loves you too much for that.

951
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,296
<i>Don't cry.</i>

952
01:10:07,372 --> 01:10:10,068
Nanny will stay with you
until your father comes home.

953
01:10:43,074 --> 01:10:44,837
Mai!

954
01:10:48,513 --> 01:10:50,845
Where are you?

955
01:10:55,753 --> 01:10:57,345
Mai!

956
01:11:00,091 --> 01:11:02,686
<i>Mai, come back!</i>

957
01:11:05,096 --> 01:11:06,085
Did you see her anywhere?

958
01:11:06,196 --> 01:11:07,686
No sign at all.

959
01:11:07,799 --> 01:11:09,858
<i>She wasn't at the bus stop?</i>

960
01:11:10,602 --> 01:11:11,863
That's very strange.

961
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:13,766
Where could she possibly have gone?

962
01:11:13,872 --> 01:11:15,737
Maybe she's angry about this morning.

963
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:18,240
We had a bad argument and -

964
01:11:18,343 --> 01:11:20,777
maybe she went to visit Mommy
in the hospital!

965
01:11:20,879 --> 01:11:22,574
<i>The hospital's so far from here.</i>

966
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:24,079
<i>It's - oh, my heavens!</i>

967
01:11:24,182 --> 01:11:26,082
It would take a grown man

968
01:11:26,184 --> 01:11:27,845
three hours to get there.

969
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,581
Hey!

970
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:31,847
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

971
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:34,116
Please, you must get your father
right now.

972
01:11:34,224 --> 01:11:36,522
Tell him little Mai has disappeared.

973
01:11:45,403 --> 01:11:48,304
How could you do
something so stupid, Mai?

974
01:11:48,406 --> 01:11:49,896
You always get lost.

975
01:11:56,414 --> 01:11:58,177
Mai!

976
01:12:05,156 --> 01:12:07,022
<i>I'm sorry to bother you,</i>

977
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:11,152
but you haven't seen
a little girl, have you?

978
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:13,422
<i>She's my sister, about 5 years old.</i>

979
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,998
<i>Well, seems to me I remember someone.</i>

980
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:19,629
Yes, near as I can recall,
she went that way.

981
01:12:19,737 --> 01:12:21,704
Maybe she went through the forest.

982
01:12:23,741 --> 01:12:26,072
<i>Then again, she might've gone
in the other direction.</i>

983
01:12:26,177 --> 01:12:28,874
Are you sure it was your sister?

984
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:43,287
<i>All sorts of folks come by here,
but I don't see them.</i>

985
01:12:43,394 --> 01:12:44,793
<i>Mai, I'm scared.</i>

986
01:12:44,896 --> 01:12:46,227
Thank you!

987
01:12:52,837 --> 01:12:55,670
Mai!

988
01:13:16,728 --> 01:13:18,058
Please stop!

989
01:13:18,162 --> 01:13:20,858
Aah!

990
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:22,295
<i>Hey, are you crazy, kid?</i>

991
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,389
<i>I'm looking for my sister.</i>

992
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:25,332
Have you seen a little girl
wandering around?

993
01:13:26,404 --> 01:13:27,132
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

994
01:13:27,505 --> 01:13:29,769
Mai's her name,
and she's 5 years old.

995
01:13:29,874 --> 01:13:31,136
She probably got lost.

996
01:13:31,242 --> 01:13:33,267
<i>We haven't seen anyone, have we?</i>

997
01:13:33,378 --> 01:13:34,811
<i>l think she's going to
Shichikoku Yama.</i>

998
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:36,071
<i>We just came from there,</i>

999
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:40,014
<i>but we haven't come across anybody.</i>

1000
01:13:40,118 --> 01:13:41,551
Well, thank you.

1001
01:13:42,587 --> 01:13:44,555
<i>By the way, where are you from?</i>

1002
01:13:44,656 --> 01:13:45,554
Matsugo.

1003
01:13:45,657 --> 01:13:47,453
You walked from there to here?

1004
01:13:47,558 --> 01:13:49,048
That s three hours away.

1005
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,253
Well, good luck, kid.

1006
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:53,125
I hope you find her!

1007
01:14:03,107 --> 01:14:04,699
Satsuki, wait!

1008
01:14:04,809 --> 01:14:06,242
Come here!

1009
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:08,005
Kanta!

1010
01:14:09,881 --> 01:14:12,042
<i>We haven't found her yet.
How about you?</i>

1011
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:13,082
Nothing.

1012
01:14:13,184 --> 01:14:15,516
My dad's got everyone
searching for her,

1013
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:16,450
<i>so you go home,</i>

1014
01:14:16,554 --> 01:14:18,818
<i>and I'll bike
to Shichikoku Yama, O. K.?</i>

1015
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:21,324
<i>I'm afraid
if she visits Mommy's hospital,</i>

1016
01:14:21,426 --> 01:14:23,018
<i>she'll completely lose her -</i>

1017
01:14:23,127 --> 01:14:26,289
Somebody found
some sandals by the lake.

1018
01:14:27,465 --> 01:14:29,456
There's no way she could get
past all those people

1019
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:31,398
without somebody noticing.

1020
01:14:31,502 --> 01:14:32,161
Oh!

1021
01:14:33,771 --> 01:14:36,762
<i>Hey, don't worry!
Nobody said they were Mai's sandals!</i>

1022
01:14:53,925 --> 01:14:55,859
Did you find her yet?

1023
01:15:31,129 --> 01:15:33,859
Go back a bit over towards your right!

1024
01:15:33,965 --> 01:15:35,933
<i>Hey, you have any poles left?</i>

1025
01:15:45,377 --> 01:15:46,867
<i>There's Satsuki.</i>

1026
01:15:46,978 --> 01:15:47,740
Eh?

1027
01:15:48,146 --> 01:15:49,476
Look.

1028
01:15:51,616 --> 01:15:52,207
Mai!

1029
01:15:52,316 --> 01:15:53,214
Mai!

1030
01:15:54,252 --> 01:15:56,220
Look, Satsuki.

1031
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,287
Is it hers?

1032
01:16:04,896 --> 01:16:06,454
<i>It's not hers.</i>

1033
01:16:06,564 --> 01:16:08,532
What?

1034
01:16:13,405 --> 01:16:15,236
Ohh. . .

1035
01:16:17,175 --> 01:16:19,506
Merciful heavens.

1036
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:20,769
<i>You know, Satsuki,</i>

1037
01:16:20,878 --> 01:16:22,812
<i>for a while
I thought it might be Mai's.</i>

1038
01:16:22,914 --> 01:16:25,906
Mom, I told you
you jumped to conclusions.

1039
01:16:26,017 --> 01:16:27,245
<i>Forget it! It isn't hers!</i>

1040
01:16:27,351 --> 01:16:29,251
<i>So, what do we do now?</i>

1041
01:16:29,353 --> 01:16:31,253
<i>We keep on looking, that's what.</i>

1042
01:16:31,355 --> 01:16:33,755
<i>Whatever you do, you better hurry up.</i>

1043
01:16:33,858 --> 01:16:35,258
<i>It'll be dark soon.</i>

1044
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:36,758
I am grateful to you all.

1045
01:16:36,861 --> 01:16:38,761
If you could keep searching -

1046
01:16:38,863 --> 01:16:40,763
<i>Don't worry. We understand.</i>

1047
01:16:40,865 --> 01:16:44,062
<i>Don't you think
we should call the police?</i>

1048
01:16:44,168 --> 01:16:45,567
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

1049
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,262
Do you think the police could -

1050
01:16:47,371 --> 01:16:49,635
Where are you going?

1051
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:07,948
<i>Totoro,</i>

1052
01:17:08,059 --> 01:17:09,788
<i>I beg you, please protect Mai.</i>

1053
01:17:09,894 --> 01:17:11,794
She ll be lost and probably scared.

1054
01:17:11,896 --> 01:17:14,297
<i>I'll be good for the rest of my life</i>

1055
01:17:14,398 --> 01:17:15,865
If I can just see her again.

1056
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:41,353
Oh!

1057
01:17:41,459 --> 01:17:42,448
Aah!

1058
01:17:44,829 --> 01:17:45,694
What?

1059
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:47,795
Totoro!

1060
01:17:49,534 --> 01:17:51,092
<i>Totoro, Mai's lost somewhere.</i>

1061
01:17:51,202 --> 01:17:53,693
<i>l looked and looked,
but I can't find her anywhere!</i>

1062
01:17:53,804 --> 01:17:54,702
<i>Oh, please.</i>

1063
01:17:54,805 --> 01:17:57,205
You have to help me find her.

1064
01:17:57,308 --> 01:18:00,766
<i>She's probably alone somewhere
crying and upset.</i>

1065
01:18:00,878 --> 01:18:03,346
<i>Oh, Totoro, I'm scared.</i>

1066
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:49,592
What?

1067
01:18:57,702 --> 01:19:00,364
<i>He wouldn't be able to.</i>

1068
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,865
But how come nobody sees the bus?

1069
01:19:33,371 --> 01:19:34,736
Oh. . .

1070
01:19:34,839 --> 01:19:36,739
Ha ha ha ha!

1071
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:38,100
Oh!

1072
01:19:55,794 --> 01:19:56,624
<i>Next stop,</i>

1073
01:19:56,727 --> 01:19:57,751
Little Sister.

1074
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:15,145
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1075
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:18,744
Mai, where are you?

1076
01:20:27,092 --> 01:20:28,923
But how does he make it do that?

1077
01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:00,783
Ohh. . .

1078
01:21:01,026 --> 01:21:03,324
Mai!

1079
01:21:05,964 --> 01:21:08,124
But, Sis, where are you?

1080
01:21:09,701 --> 01:21:11,760
Satsuki!

1081
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:13,462
Mai!

1082
01:21:22,646 --> 01:21:23,977
There you are!

1083
01:21:24,081 --> 01:21:25,776
Satsuki!

1084
01:21:26,618 --> 01:21:27,606
Ha ha ha!

1085
01:21:28,652 --> 01:21:29,778
<i>Oh, Mai.</i>

1086
01:21:29,888 --> 01:21:32,151
I'm sorry.

1087
01:21:33,924 --> 01:21:34,788
Tell me one thing.

1088
01:21:34,893 --> 01:21:37,293
Were you bringing that corn
to the hospital?

1089
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:38,793
Mm-hmm.

1090
01:21:44,135 --> 01:21:45,000
<i>Next stop,</i>

1091
01:21:45,102 --> 01:21:48,037
Shichikoku Yama Hospital.

1092
01:21:48,139 --> 01:21:51,040
<i>You mean we can go to Mom's hospital?</i>

1093
01:21:53,912 --> 01:21:56,004
<i>You're wonderful!</i>

1094
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:05,554
I'm sorry.

1095
01:22:05,657 --> 01:22:09,285
It was all because of my silly cold
that the hospital sent that telegram.

1096
01:22:09,394 --> 01:22:11,828
The grief it must've caused all of you.

1097
01:22:12,364 --> 01:22:14,092
I hope you can forgive me.

1098
01:22:14,199 --> 01:22:16,429
It was simply a bureaucratic mistake.

1099
01:22:16,534 --> 01:22:19,833
<i>I'm sure it wasn't terribly traumatic
for either of the girls.</i>

1100
01:22:19,938 --> 01:22:22,236
<i>It just means
you'll be home next weekend.</i>

1101
01:22:22,339 --> 01:22:23,431
They understand.

1102
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:27,102
<i>l wouldn't be at all surprised
if they suffered more than we know,</i>

1103
01:22:27,212 --> 01:22:30,544
<i>in particular Satsuki
because she's so smart and sensitive.</i>

1104
01:22:30,648 --> 01:22:32,776
Hmm, could be right.

1105
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:35,041
You'd better be careful
after I get home

1106
01:22:35,152 --> 01:22:37,552
because I intend to spoil them rotten.

1107
01:22:37,655 --> 01:22:38,644
Oh, no!

1108
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:47,659
Look. Mommy's laughing.

1109
01:22:47,766 --> 01:22:49,233
She seems pretty healthy to me.

1110
01:22:49,334 --> 01:22:50,460
Yep.

1111
01:22:57,908 --> 01:23:00,138
<i>Oh, I can't wait to get up
on my feet again.</i>

1112
01:23:00,245 --> 01:23:02,304
Neither can we.

1113
01:23:02,414 --> 01:23:04,348
Oh.

1114
01:23:06,383 --> 01:23:07,908
Hmm.

1115
01:23:10,055 --> 01:23:11,579
<i>Now, that's weird.</i>

1116
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:13,316
Oh!

1117
01:23:13,557 --> 01:23:14,524
What happened?

1118
01:23:15,226 --> 01:23:16,819
<i>Well, I'm not sure,
but I could've sworn</i>

1119
01:23:16,927 --> 01:23:20,658
l saw both girls in the treetop
laughing.

1120
01:23:21,398 --> 01:23:24,060
That might not be as crazy as you think.

1121
01:23:24,169 --> 01:23:26,337
