- Come on! We made a deal.
- I know, but it's extremely crazy.

00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,790
It's mentally irregular,

- I know, but, uh...

- When did you think of this?
- About three years ago.

- Stallion, when you won that last fight...

...you won by one second.
You beat me by one second.

Oh! So now you just gotta
prove it to yourself, right?

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,158
Just for myself. No TV,

- I do all the work. OK.

28

You ain't as young as springtime no more.

29
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,719
- I'm still young enough to whip <i>your</i> butt.
- Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that?

No, you don't want any of this.

- Fine.

45

- A little bit?
- Where'd you get that hat?

47
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,149
- A friend gave it to me. Like it?
- Who punched you in the eye?

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,748
- Same friend.
- That's weird. Better hurry, Dad.

49

You know, you're developin'
a very, very loud personality.

Don't go too fast,

- Great. You're here.

- Now you can stop calling him names.
- You been callin' me names?

- Oh, uh, gettin' punched.

- And your present.
- Where is it?

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,195
Let me set the mood. I gotta turn
the lights down and everythin'.

63
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,550
- Watch this.
- Is it parked outside?

64
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
Just be patient, would ya?

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,113
I'm so excited, I'm startin' to sweat.

66

I feel like I'm gettin' ready to go into
a big fight or somethin'. Watch this.

<i>(electronic voice) Happy birthday, Paulie.</i>

- Your present.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,316
I wanted a sports car for my birthday,
not no walkin' trash can!

70
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,398
- Come on! He looks great.
- This is extremely psycho.

71
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,909
You have no friends,
so we thought you'd like it.

72
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,838
Pretend you're happy.
It'll keep you company.

73
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,474
- That's a great-lookin' guy.
<i>- Please make a wish.</i>

It's creepy! It talks!

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,478
Creepy? I wish I had one of these
when I was growin' up.

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,115
- Go on, make a wish, like he says.
- I wish I wasn't in this nightmare.

77
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,754
Very classy wish. What do you think?

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,314

80
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,997
- Sure.
- OK. On the count of three. One...

81
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,076
...two... three!

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,276
Whoa! Whoa!

83
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,752
- Well, they're out.
- You "drownded" me!

84

- Rocky!
- Yeah, you noticed.

87
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,875
What are you doing with that cake?

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,278
The party ain't over yet, you know.
We still gotta celebrate some more.

89
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,472
- It's a special night.
- Yeah, it's Wednesday.

90
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
It's Wednesday, but in case you forgot...

91
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,319
...it's almost been nine years since
you've been married to me, so...

92
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,396
...here's your prize.

93
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,230
- But our anniversary's a week away.
- That's true, but, uh... why wait?

94
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,750
- Has it been that rough?
- <i>(laughs)</i> No, no.

95
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,430
I tell you, it's been excellent.
Open your prize. Go on.

96
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,279
- Go on, open your prize.
- OK.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,230
- Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.

98
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,555
All right!

99
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,877
I was so nervous. I didn't know.
I... I hope you like it.

100
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,597
The guy I bought it from says even if
it looks like a snake, don't worry...

101
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,995
...cos it won't bite you.

Oh! It's beautiful.

You know what's amazing?

104
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,552
That after all these years,
everything still seems kinda new.

105
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,996
You remember a long time ago
I told you that, uh...

106
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,352
...I said that you ain't never
gettin' rid of me. Remember that?

107
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,589
Well, you're not.

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,075
You're never gettin' rid of me.

146
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,517
Your head doesn't look
like a punching bag.

147
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,393
No? That's nice. Thanks a lot.

148
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,670
It looks like a catcher's mitt!

149
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,598
Oh! A wise guy, huh?

150
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,190
Mr Balboa! Mr Creed's on the phone.

151
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,717
- Yeah? I'll be right there.
<i>- You can get it right here.</i>

152
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,799
- I hope it's not another rematch.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

153
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,673
Hello? Yeah, Apollo... Turn that down.

154
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,510
Apollo, how ya doin'? Yeah?
You're comin' out? That's great.

155
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,598
What am <i>I</i> doin'? I'm just gettin' dizzy.

156
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,478
My husband and I thank you for
coming to our training quarter today.

157
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,673
As you can see, it is highly advanced, and
we wish to show the American press...

158
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,110
...a small portion of the advances
our country has made...

159
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,390
...in the technology
of human performance.

160
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,751
<i>(man#1)</i> Coach Rimsky, what does
this do to enhance performance?

161
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,836
- Well...
- If I may answer.

162
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,517
It makes a man a better man...

163
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,031
...a great athlete a superathlete,
by harnessing all his strength.

164
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,118
Though most of the world is
ignorant in body chemistry...

165
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,791
...we wish to... educate your country.
- There have been rumours of doping...

166
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,833
...and widespread distribution of
anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union.

167
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,636
- Has Drago partaken in any experiments?
- No! Lvan is naturally trained.

168
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,718
Then how do you explain his,
uh... freakish strength?

169
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,037
Like your Popeye,
he ate his spinach every day.

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,112
- Shall we have a demonstration?
- <i>(man#1)</i> Please do.

171
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,958
A normal heavyweight averages
700 pounds of pressure per square inch.

172
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,116
As you can see,
Drago averages 1850 pounds.

173
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,910
- So the result's quite obvious.
- And what results are those?

174
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,838
Whatever he hits, he destroys.

175
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,670
I've seen Drago fight when he was an
amateur. He's big and strong, but clumsy.

176
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,155
I know I can beat him.

177
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,637
- Why do you wanna fight again?
- Let's just say it's somethin' <i>I</i> believe in.

178
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,833
- Uh, you can do your homework.
- OK. Later, Dad. Later, Uncle Paulie.

179
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,916
- Later, Apollo.
- Later, big man.

180
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,157
See you later, kiddo.
Don't you think people are expectin'...

181
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,513
...to see Rocky whack this bum out first?
- Yeah. And he will, when it's for real.

182
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,950
- This is an exhibition bout. Kids' stuff.
- What's the purpose?

183
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,119
What at this point in your life
is worth getting hurt for?

184
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,676
# <i>Double or nothin',</i>
<i>you've gotta have a partner...</i>

185
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,360
- What the hell is that?
- That's my girl.

186
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,431
# <i>Takin' and givin',</i>
<i>it's time we started livin'...</i>

187
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,274
- Thanks, honey.
<i>- (female voice) You're welcome.</i>

188
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,029
- That's a nice song.
<i>- It's my favourite. You're the greatest.</i>

189
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,675
<i>See you, sport.</i>

190
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,031
- See you.
- Paulie, who taught it to talk like that?

191
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,876
- She loves me.
- Oh.

192
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,117
# <i>You stepped out of the night...</i>

193
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,514
Like I was sayin', I don't want this chump
to come over here with all that hype...

194
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,518
...tryin' to make us look bad.
They try every other way.

195
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,111
With Rock's help, we can get great
media coverage. We make <i>them</i> look bad.

196
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,357
- I think it's wrong.
- No. It's never been more right.

197
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,517
You're a great fighter,
but you've been retired five years.

198
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,234
Isn't it time to start
thinking about something else?

199
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,272
How much can you take? Either of you?

200
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,556
I'll... get the coffee.

201
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,598
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

202
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,075
I just care about you both. I...

203
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,035
You ever try these comics?

204
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,073
- No, no.
- Keeps your fertility.

205
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,599
Hey, Paulie.

206
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,032
<i>In the ring now... Rocky's holding that</i>
<i>right hand. He's fighting right-handed!</i>

207
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,390
<i>(Apollo)</i> Oh, now this was a great fight.

208
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,193
Great(!) I'm gettin' punchy just watchin' it!

209
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,756
<i>Mamma mia!</i> What you usin'
for a chin there, Stallion?

210
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,355
- I should've slipped that one.
- You definitely should've slipped that.

211
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,349
It's crazy how people just care about you
in that ring and when you're bleedin'...

212
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,119
...but once you step out,
you're ancient history.

213
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,117
It ain't ancient history.

214
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,789
I don't see anybody askin'
for autographs, do you?

215
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,959
Hey, Apollo...
Can I, uh, ask you somethin'?

216
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,159
What?

217
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,671
Well, this fight you're havin' against
the Russian. Do you think maybe...

218
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,756
...it ain't against him?

219
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,955
If it's not him, Stallion,
then who's it against?

220
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,995
Well, do you think maybe it's, like, uh,
you against you? What do you think?

221
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,396
You know, I think you really
<i>are</i> gettin' brain-damaged.

222
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,308
Maybe, but, uh... really.
I'm speakin' the truth here, Apollo.

223
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
- Are you?
- Yeah.

224
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,753
- I don't think I wanna hear this, Stallion.
- Hey, Apollo, you were a great fighter...

225
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,633
...but, look, we gotta face the facts too.

226
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,399
You don't wanna believe it,
but maybe the show is over.

227
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,512
That's easy for you to say.
You're still on top.

228
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,234
What happens when
you're not on top? Then what?

229
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,955
Where do we go, Stallion?
Cos we sure as hell can't be born again.

230
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,915
I know we can't be born again, but, let's
face it, we... we gotta change sometime.

231
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,474
I don't wanna change! I like who I am!

232
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,353
I like who you are, too, but look at that.

233
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,153
That ain't us up there no more, Apollo.

234
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,033
We can't do that the way we did it before.

235
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,709
We're changin'. We're, like,
turnin' into regular people.

236
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,912
No, Stallion!
Maybe you <i>think</i> you're changin'.

237
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,068
But you can't change what you really are.
You can forget all this money and stuff.

238
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,156
Cos it don't change a thing.

239
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,114
You and me, we don't even have a choice.

240
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,553
We're born with a killer instinct that you
can't just turn off and on like some radio.

241
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,355
We <i>have</i> to be right in the middle of
the action, cos we're the warriors.

242
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,153
Without some challenge,
some damn war to fight...

243
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,636
...then the warrior may
as well be dead, Stallion.

244
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,636
So I'm askin' you...

245
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,796
...as a friend...

246
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,152
...stand by my side this one last time.

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,355
You're a great talker, Apollo.

248
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,952
All right, but... when this is over...?

249
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,070
You know me, Stallion.

250
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,555
I always think of somethin' else.

251
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,919
That's what I'm afraid of.
All right. You got a deal there.

252
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,634
I feel sorry for that guy, you know?

253
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,790
<i>(man#1)</i> What made you decide to
put on an exhibition fight with Drago?

254
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,593
<i>(Apollo)</i> Let's call it
a sense of responsibility.

255
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,676
<i>(man#2)</i> Responsibility, how?

256
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,156
I had to teach this young fella
to box - American style!

257
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,192
Isn't Drago a little inexperienced
to be in the same ring?

258
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,790
Well, you know,
some folks got to learn the hard way!

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,470
- <i>(man#3)</i> No quick knockout predictions?
- No. I'm not angry with him.

260
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,230
I just wanna show the whole world that
Russia doesn't have all the best athletes.

261
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,557
Rocky, how do you think
Apollo should fight Drago?

262
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,879
Well, personally, I think the first thing
you'd better get Apollo is a ladder.

263
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,237
Drago, how does it feel to spar
with the great former champion?

264
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,275
The man's tongue didn't
come through customs.

265
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,160
My husband is very happy
to have this opportunity.

266
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,953
- It's his dream.
- <i>(man#4)</i> Dream? How do you mean?

267
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,959
In our country, Apollo Creed is
well known and very respected.

268
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,471
- It could be a good victory.
- Whoa! Wait a minute, now. Hold it.

269
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,355
When? Now you don't really think
you're gonna whip me, do ya?

270
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,189
- Well, he didn't come here to lose.
- You hold on, little lady.

271
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,756
- Lose, and lose royally, he's gonna do.
- How can you be so sure?

272
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,954
I've been with the best. I beat the best.
I retired more men than Social Security!

273
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,755
Excuse, please. You are not
very realistic, are you, Mr Creed?

274
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,791
What are <i>you</i> talkin' about?

275
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,629
You can box, yes, but you are far too
old to think you can win over Drago.

276
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,957
- Is that a fact?
- Yes! And it could be a painful one!

277
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,516
Put that heavy bag with eyeballs
in the ring with me and <i>you'll</i> see pain!

278
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,552
- Why do you insult us?
- Now you just hold on here.

279
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,195
I'm not the bad guy. I came to talk
about a friendly exhibition bout...

280
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,154
...till Comrade Bigmouth started up!
- It is <i>you</i> who are the aggressor.

281
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,999
I wish to say to the press, in all fairness...

282
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,590
...Drago should not even fight this man,
because he is a has-been.

283
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,871
You get that big chump
in the ring right now...

284
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,637
- Stop this before you get hurt.
- I don't wanna hear! Let that chump go!

285
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,995
All right, all right. I've said what I feel.

286
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,714
- We'll finish this in the ring!

- How did I do?
- A little loud for me.

- But good?
- Oh, yeah. Very good.

- Come on.
- Patience is a virtue.

<i>- (Apollo)</i> I'm ready to rock 'n' roll.
- <i>(Rocky)</i> You gotta get your equipment.

- I feel like a mummy.

298
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,117
- How does it feel? OK?
- Feels great. I feel like I could eat nails.

299
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,471
- I never tried them snails.
- What are you talkin' about?

300
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,388
Snails. I never had 'em. I see 'em in
the garden, but I never want to eat 'em.

301
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,833
I didn't say anythin' about snails.
I said nails. N-N-Nails, Stallion!

302
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,679
You look pretty good, but, you know...

303
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,268
...just do me a favour
when you go up there.

304
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,871
- Try not to wear yourself out, OK?
- Yeah, wear myself out. Sure.

305
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,117
Well, it's just that you ain't
been in the ring for five years.

306
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,950

- I'm in the best shape of my life.

307
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,232

- Hey, I'm not sayin' you're not ready...

308

...but personally, if it were me...

309
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,231

a couple of weeks.

Postpone?

311
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,831
Come on, Apollo. We don't know anythin'
about this guy you're fightin', really.

312
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,273
Let's say I postpone. I pull out, somebody
else steps in and whips this chump.

313
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,154
- Then where does that leave me?
- This is just some kind of exhibition fight.

314

- This thing don't mean nothin'.
- No, man. That's where you're wrong.

315
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,191
This is <i>not</i> just an exhibition fight
that doesn't mean anything.

316
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,871
This is us against them.

Stallion...

318

about now, but you will when it's over.

Good luck. I hope after we can be friends.

323

- Be patient. Almost done.

<i>(Stu)</i> The two fighters come to the centre
for instructions from referee Lou Filippo.

401
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,357
You know the rules. Watch the low blows,
kidney punches and rabbit punches.

402
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,871
In case of a knockdown, go to the corner
and stay there until I tell you to come out.

- It's showtime!
- Excuse me. Didn't you forget somethin'?

411
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,036
Apollo seems to be in great spirits.

412
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,073
He's really putting on a show
for this capacity crowd.

413

Be back in a minute, all right?

414

Creed back-pedalling now.
He's been away five years.

417
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,713
Neither fighter ready to throw a punch.
A left jab there... and once again.

418
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,800
- A slip by Creed.
- <i>(Warner)</i> This is bizarre.

419
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,311
Creed is over the hill, and, uh...
the Russian hasn't fought anybody.

420
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,838
- Keep movin'. Stick him!
- <i>(Stu)</i> Drago's moving in again.

421
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,272
A left hand by Creed. Another left hand
by Creed, and Drago moves away.

422
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,830
Another left hand by Creed. Drago
waiting, waiting, cocking that right hand.

Get outta there! Get outta there!

426
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,199
<i>(Stu)</i> A left. He's taking some punishment
now. Drago moves him against the ropes.

427
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,469
Tie him up now!

428
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,229

and throws Creed across the ring!

<i>(bell rings)</i>

434
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,113
Creed is against the ropes!
I think they may stop it.

435
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,837
What are you guys doin'?!
This is supposed to be an exhibition!

436
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,910
Tremendous end to the first round by the
Russian, and a very bloody Apollo Creed.

437
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,470
The Soviet's strength is incredible!

438
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,798
Champ, look. I gotta stop ya.
This fight's finished. I gotta call it.

439
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,673
- You can't do no more.
- I'm here to fight him.

440
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,510
- He's killin' ya! I gotta stop this thing.
- Promise me you're not gonna stop it.

441
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,030
That was a pulverising round
for the ex-champion.

442
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,039
Hey, folks.
Ivan Drago is definitely for real.

443
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,312
You don't stop this fight, no matter what.

444
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,396
<i>(chanting)</i> Apollo! Apollo!

445
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,316
No matter what.

446
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,071
<i>(bell)</i>

447
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,913
<i>(Stu)</i> Creed now comes out
for round two dancing around.

448
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,838
The legs appear to be still a little rubbery.

449
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,349
<i>(referee)</i> Get your hands up.

450
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,796
<i>(Stu)</i> And now it is the Russian just
standing there, trying to intimidate Creed.

451
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,634
And the Russian throws a right hand
to the jaw! Another right to the head!

452
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,239
Creed's being pounded without mercy!

453
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,476
Stop the fight!

454
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,196
- The referee is thrown across the ring!
- Throw the towel! Throw the towel!

455
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,350
- I've never seen Apollo take so much.
- Throw the damn towel!

456
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,394
<i>(distorted)</i> No!

457
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,873
- My God!
- <i>(Stu)</i> Creed is down!

458
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,632
Apollo is down,
and he could be badly hurt.

459
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,351
- Get these guys outta here.
- The winner, lvan Drago.

460
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,155
- Let me through! Apollo!
- I cannot be defeated.

461
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,589
- Is he OK?
- Somebody get a doctor in here!

462
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,952
- There is no movement by Creed.
- I defeat old man.

463
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,911
- Is he dead?
- Get outta here!

464
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,031
It's absolute pandemonium!

465
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,349
Will ya let him breathe?

466
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,597
Soon... I defeat real champion.

467
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,156
Where's the stretcher?
Let him breathe, for God's sake!

468
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,670
What started out as a joke
has turned out to be a disaster.

469
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,950
Creed is in a very serious condition.

470
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,310
- Is the man alive?
- You can make it, Apollo.

471
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,635
If he dies... he dies.

472
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,150
There's a lot I could say... about this man.

473
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,754
But I don't know if it matters now.

474
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,949
I guess what matters is...

475
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,435
...what he stood for...

476
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,835
...what he lived for, and...

477
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,469
...what he died for.

478
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,675
You always did everything...

479
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,635
...the way <i>you</i> wanted it.

480
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,438
I know I didn't understand that, but...

481
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,118
...now I understand.

482
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,435
I'll never forget you, Apollo.

483
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,597
You're the best.

484
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,511
- <i>(woman)</i> Rocky, is the decision final?
- Yes.

485
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,110
<i>(man#1)</i> Is this the first time
the champion has given up his crown?

486
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,596
- I don't know about that.
<i>- (man#2)</i> Doesn't the title matter?

487
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,870
Not until this is over.

488
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,118
<i>(man#3)</i> Considering Rocky's punching
power, do you still expect an easy fight?

489
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,357
- <i>(Rimsky)</i> Yes, of course.
- It's a matter of size...

490
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,554
...and evolution. Isn't it, gentlemen? Drago
is the most perfectly trained athlete ever.

491
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,515
This other man has not the size,
or the endurance, or the genetics to win.

492
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,155
It's physically impossible
for this little man to win.

493
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,397
Drago is a look at the future.

494
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,672
<i>(man#4)</i> Champ,
how much are you making for this fight?

495
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,713
- No money. It's not about money.
- <i>(woman)</i> Has the fight date been set yet?

496
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,400
- December 25th.
- <i>(man#1)</i> Why Christmas?

497
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,829
- That's what I was told.
- <i>(woman)</i> Where?

498
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,996
- It's in Russia.
- Are you nuts?

499
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,475
<i>(man#2)</i> Rocky, what's going on?

500
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,910
We fight in Soviet Union,
or we fight nowhere.

501
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,199
Why don't you ask Drago's wife
why she is afraid? Tell them, please.

502
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,314
I'm afraid for my husband's life.
We have threats of violence everywhere.

503
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,037
We are not in politics. All I want is for my
husband to be safe, to be treated fairly.

504
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,438
You call him a killer.
He's a professional fighter, not a killer.

505
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,836
You have this belief that
you are better than us...

506
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,794
...that this country is so very good,
and we are so very bad.

507
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,749
You have this belief that you are so fair,
and we are so very cruel.

508
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,871
It is lies and false propaganda...

509
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,039
...to support this antagonistic
and violent government!

510
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,076
Violent? We don't keep our people
behind a wall with machine guns!

511
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,395
- Who are you?
- Who am <i>I?</i>

512
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,832
- I'm... the unsilent majority, bigmouth!
- Good! Yes, good!

513
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,988
Insult us! Is more typical rude behaviour
towards visiting foreigners!

514
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,432
But perhaps this simple defeat
of this little so-called champion...

515
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,389
...will be a perfect example
of how pathetically weak...

516
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,478
...your society has become. We go!

517
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,799
<i>(reporters)</i> Mrs Balboa!

518
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,151
- How do you feel about Russia?
- Is your husband going to Moscow?

519
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,035
How does it feel to be part of
such a controversial decision?

520
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,674
Did Creed's death
make up your husband's mind?

521
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,476
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Why is he going at Christmas?

522
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,670
When will you be going to Russia?

523
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,713
I'm not going to Russia. I don't know
what you're talking about!

524
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,752
I don't know what you
people are doing here!

525
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,756
- Rocky?
- Yeah?

526
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,994
- You all right?
- Yeah.

527
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,872
Fine.

528
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,956
Why'd you do it?

529
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,157
- I just gotta do what I gotta do.
- You don't have to do anything.

530
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,431
No, Adrian, I do, and...
I gotta leave this place, too.

531
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,915
So where are you... going?

532
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,430
They said they were gonna
let me train in Russia.

533
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,588
I just wanna go someplace where I ain't
gonna think about nothin' except him.

534
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,508
Rocky, give it some time. Don't do this.

535
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,710
A lot of people live with hurt.

536
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,559
A lot of people don't have a choice. I do.

537
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,831
And for that you're willing
to lose everything?

538
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,315
Adrian, this ain't everything.

539
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,116
This house, and the cars, and all
the stuff we got... that ain't everything.

540
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,154
There's a lot more than this, Adrian.

541
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,159
Before, there were reasons to fight I
understood, but I don't understand this.

542
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,829
Even if you win, what have you won?
Apollo's still gone.

543
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,432
Why can't you change your thinking?
Everybody else does!

544
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,235
Cos I'm a fighter!
That's the way I'm made, Adrian.

545
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,109
That's what you married.
We can't change what we are.

546
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,198
- Yes, you can.
- You can't change anythin'.

547
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,233
- All we can do is go with what we are.
- You can't go with what you are!

548
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,670
Have you read the papers?
Do you know what everybody says?

549
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,952
It's suicide! You've seen him.
You know how strong he is.

550
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,516
You can't win!

551
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,996
Oh, Adrian.

552
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,235
Adrian always tells the truth.

553
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,956
No, maybe I can't win.

554
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,395
Maybe the only thing I can do...

555
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,278
...is just take everythin' he's got.

556
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,029
But to beat me...
he's gonna have to kill me.

557
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,519
And to kill me, he's gonna have to
have the heart to stand in front of me.

558
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,471
And to do that, he's gotta
be willin' to die himself.

559
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,872
And I don't know if he's ready to do that.

560
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,956
I don't know.

Drago!

761

Hello, and merry Christmas
from a very unusual place.

762
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,639
We're in Moscow. I'm Barry Tompkins,
along with Al Bandiero...

763
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,548
...and this promises to be the most
watched event in boxing history.

The Iron Horse from America, Rocky
Balboa, comes here to the Soviet Union...

Ivan Drago: Since that tragedy in Las
Vegas and the death of Apollo Creed...

766
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,872
...he's been re-nicknamed
"Death from Above".

<i>(chanting)</i> Drago! Drago!

The general secretary of the Soviet

769
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,435
...have now made their way to their seats
high above the ring here in Moscow.

770
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:49,036
I know you're kinda busy, but I wanna
tell you some things I never told you.

771
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:54,029
I know sometimes I act stupid and I say
stupid things, but you kept me around...

772
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,119
...when other people would've said
"Drop that bum." You give me respect.

773
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,949
It's hard for me to say these kinda
things because that ain't my way...

774
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:07,234
...but if I could unzip myself and step out
and be someone else, I'd wanna be you.

You're all heart, Rock.

Thanks, Paulie.

One of the fighters is starting to make his
way through this crowd toward the ring.

781
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,712
- Listen to this crowd!
- <i>(Al)</i> This borders on pure hatred.

782
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:47,516

stone, a picture of concentration...

783

not seem to bother him one bit.

784
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,360
The champ has a look that
could burn through lead.

785
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,109
It seems the booing crowd has
absolutely no effect on the man.

786
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,231
His concentration is like stone.

787
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,635
- That's my dad.
- We know.

788

Ivan Drago, a man with
an entire country in his corner.

793

Look at the expression
on the face of lvan Drago.

794
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,997
He seems impervious
to this madness of the crowd.

795
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,873
He's like a volcano just waiting to erupt.

796

<i>(English commentator)</i> The Russian is
cool as he acknowledges his premier.

797
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:32,073
I would like to point out again,
this is a non-sanctioned fight.

798
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:37,479
This is not for the title. The American
Boxing Commission has not sanctioned it.

They're toe to toe.

811
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,750
The Russian towers above the American.
It's a true case of David and Goliath here.

It's unbelievable, the...
the condition of both men.

it is Drago backing Rocky up with a jab.

And Balboa is not staying on balance
because of the long jab of the Russian.

to touch the Russian.

Balboa 15 feet across the ring...

for Rocky Balboa.

845

He's not only fighting
an invincible opponent...

Weak.

You cut him! You hurt him! You see?

You see? He's not a machine. He's a man!

He's not human...

885
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,599

Amazing willpower!

And Rocky's determination is beginning
to win over what was a hostile crowd.

This is incredible.

All your strength! All your power!
All your love! Everythin' you've got!

You trained this fool. He's a disgrace.

For me!

To win you gotta knock him out! Punch
and punch till you can't punch no more!

916
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,272
- This is your whole life here!

<i>(Englishman)</i> Which of these magnificent
fighters will be standing at the end?

921
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,474
<i>(Barry)</i> Drago snaps out a stiff jab.
And another.

922
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,555
Rocky taking punishment. Trying to get
inside. He's completely exhausted.

923
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,318
Come on, Rock! What are you waitin' for?!

924

Come on! Fight!

927
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,153
Balboa is chopping the Russian down!

928
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,755
<i>(Barry)</i> Rocky Balboa throwing
punches at the Russian.

And Drago throws a hard right hand
that stuns Rocky Balboa!

930
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,714
Don't go down! Don't go down!

931
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:50,272
<i>(Barry)</i> Forget technique, forget strategy.
This is a street fight. Who wants it most?

932
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,278
- What is he doin'?!
- He's winnin'!

933
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,835
To the body! To the body!

934
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,760
Rocko, knock his head off!

935

You're gonna do it!

936

<i>(Barry)</i> Rocky Balboa has done the
impossible! And these people love him!

More than ever, Rocky has
proven himself a true champion!
