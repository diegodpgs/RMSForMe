1
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,792
Come to Los Angeles.

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,297
The sun shines bright, the
beaches are wide and inviting...

3
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:35,050
and the orange groves stretch
as far as the eye can see.

4
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:39,180
There are jobs aplenty
and land is cheap.

5
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,724
Every workingman can
have his own house...

6
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:46,645
and inside every house, a
happy, all-American family.

7
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,857
You can have all this.
And who knows?

8
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:52,109
You could even be discovered...

9
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:55,571
become a movie star,
or at least see one.

10
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,032
Life is good in Los Angeles.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,868
It's paradise on Earth.

12
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:07,041
That's what they tell you, anyway,
because they're selling an image.

13
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,920
They're selling it through
movies, radio and television.

14
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:14,965
In the hit show "Badge of Honor", the L.A.
cops walk on water...

15
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:17,593
as they keep the city
clean of crooks.

16
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:21,138
Yep, you'd think this place
was the Garden of Eden.

17
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:23,557
But there's trouble
in paradise...

18
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:28,103
and his name is Meyer Harris
Cohen, Mickey C to his fans.

19
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,983
Local L.A. color to the nth degree.
And his number-one bodyguard...

20
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,611
Johnny Stompanato.

21
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:38,697
Mickey C's the head of organized
crime in these parts.

22
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:43,911
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.
He kills a dozen people a year...

23
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:47,623
and the dapper little
gent does it in style.

24
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,751
And every time his picture's
on the front page...

25
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:53,963
it's a black eye for the
image of Los Angeles.

26
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,590
Because how can organized
crime exist...

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,302
in the city with the best
police force in the world?

28
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,762
Something has to be done.

29
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,015
But nothing too original,
because, hey, this is Hollywood.

30
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,352
What worked for Al Capone
would work for the Mickster.

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,815
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.
Non-payment of federal income tax.

32
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:14,733
But all is not well.

33
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:19,029
Sending Mickey up has created a vacuum,
and it's only a matter of time...

34
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:23,200
before someone with balls
of brass tries to fill it.

35
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:29,081
"Remember, dear readers,
you heard it here first."

36
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:33,836
Off the record, on the q. t...

37
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:37,506
"and very hush-hush."

38
00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:01,155
You're like Santa Claus with that list,
Bud, except everyone on it's been naughty.

39
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,075
Guy's been out of Q two weeks.

40
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:06,785
Leave it for later.

41
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,872
We gotta pick up the booze
and get it to the station.

42
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,335
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.

43
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:18,464
Have Central send a prowler
to 4216 Evergreen.

44
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,342
Parole violation. Assault
arising from a family dispute.

45
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,260
We won't be here, but
they'll see him.

46
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:34,104
Quit your whining.

47
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,523
Quit whining all the time.
It makes me sick.

48
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:38,734
Shut up.

49
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:56,794
- Who in the hell are you?
- The ghost of Christmas past.

50
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,131
- Dance with a man for a change.
- What are you, some kind of smart-ass?

51
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:18,982
You'll be out in a year and a half.
I'll get cozy with your parole officer.

52
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,779
You touch her again, I'll have you
violated on a kiddie-raper beef.

53
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,991
You know what they do to
kiddie rapers in Quentin.

54
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,086
You got someplace you can go?

55
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,172
Go get yourself fixed up.

56
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:47,845
Merry Christmas, huh?

57
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:51,181
- Merry Christmas, ma'am.
- Let's go, Bud.

58
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,142
The guys will be waiting.

59
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,148
What do you do on
"Badge of Honor", Jack?

60
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:02,151
I'm the, um, technical adviser.

61
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:06,029
I teach Brett Chase how to
walk and talk like a cop.

62
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:08,365
Brett Chase doesn't
walk and talk like you.

63
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,201
Well, that's because he's
the television version.

64
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:13,537
America isn't ready
for the real me.

65
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:15,706
Is it true you're the one
who arrested Bob Mitchum?

66
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:16,915
Mm-hm.

67
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,709
These "Badge of Honor"
guys like to pretend...

68
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:21,795
but being the real thing
must be a thrill.

69
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:23,797
Why don't you and I
go someplace quiet?

70
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:26,216
I'd love to give you the
lowdown on Mitchum.

71
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:29,344
- Big V. Jack Vincennes.
- Hey.

72
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:31,096
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.

73
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,599
Karen, this is Sid Hudgens
from Hush-Hush magazine.

74
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,101
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello, yourself.

75
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:37,561
Mm-hm.

76
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:38,854
What's that about?

77
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:42,566
We did a piece, "ingénue Dykes in
Hollywood." Her name got mentioned.

78
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:44,943
Hey, Jackie boy...

79
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,696
a friend just sold some
reefer to Matt Reynolds.

80
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,824
He's tripping the "Light
Fantastic" with Tammy Jordan.

81
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,453
Sorry, I lost you
for a second, Sid.

82
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,916
Contract players, Metro. You pinch
them, I do a nice feature next issue.

83
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,543
- Plus the usual 50 cash.
- No, I need another 50.

84
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:05,214
Two 20s for two patrolmen, and a
dime for the watch commander.

85
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,883
Jackie, it's Christmas.

86
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,384
No, it's not.

87
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:11,595
It's felony possession
of marijuana.

88
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:16,725
Actually, it's circulation
36,000 and climbing.

89
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:19,686
There's no telling where this is gonna go.
Radio, television.

90
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,857
Once you whet the public's appetite
for the truth, the sky's the limit.

91
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:31,949
Sergeant Ed Exley, son of the
legendary Preston Exley.

92
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:33,784
Must be a hard act to follow.

93
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:38,622
Why not make a mark somewhere else?
Why become a cop, Ed?

94
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,874
I like to help people.

95
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:43,710
We heard two officers were
assaulted this evening.

96
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,672
- What do you think about that?
- Goes with the job.

97
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,799
I took the report.
Luckily, they're okay.

98
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,926
Aren't you young to
be watch commander?

99
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,135
It's only tonight.

100
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:55,138
The married men have
Christmas Eve off.

101
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:57,224
- That's a good lead for the story.
- Sure.

102
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,393
Merry Christmas, captain.

103
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:02,104
- Captain Smith.
- Drop the formalities, Bobby.

104
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:05,983
- It's Christmas Eve. Call me Dudley.
- I came up with a title for the story.

105
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,986
I'm calling it "Silent
Night With the L.A.P.D."

106
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,737
That's grand.

107
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:14,658
Now, remember, Bobby,
that's "Smith." With an S.

108
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,830
- Thank you, gentlemen. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

109
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:20,998
Hold on there, lads.

110
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:27,045
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

111
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:31,300
I saw the test results on
the lieutenant's exam.

112
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:34,720
First out of 23.
What'll it be, then?

113
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,347
Patrol Division? Internal Affairs?
What?

114
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:39,016
I was thinking Detective Bureau.

115
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:46,648
Edmund, you're a
political animal.

116
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:49,901
You have the eye for human
weakness, but not the stomach.

117
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:53,363
You're wrong, sir.

118
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:57,284
Would you be willing to plant evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty...

119
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,286
in order to ensure
an indictment?

120
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:01,622
- We've been over this.
- Yes or no?

121
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:02,956
No.

122
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:06,209
Would you beat a confession out of
a suspect you knew to be guilty?

123
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:07,377
No.

124
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:10,213
Would you shoot a hardened
criminal in the back...

125
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,758
in order to offset the
chance that some lawyer...?

126
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,259
No.

127
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,596
Then for the love of God,
don't be a detective.

128
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,724
Stick to assignments where you
don't have to make those choices.

129
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,226
Dudley, I know you mean well...

130
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:27,397
but I don't need to do it the
way you did, or my father.

131
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,692
At least get rid of the glasses.

132
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,528
I can't think of a man in
the bureau who wears them.

133
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:44,831
If I get held up, you
guys better be here.

134
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:53,507
Hi, Nick. I need a delivery.

135
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:56,426
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.

136
00:08:56,594 --> 00:08:59,221
That sounds like a hell of a party.
Be right with you.

137
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:19,241
Merry Christmas.

138
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,036
Merry Christmas to you, officer.

139
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:27,040
That obvious, huh?

140
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,960
It's practically stamped
on your forehead.

141
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,045
There you go, White.

142
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:06,997
See what he wants, Buzz.

143
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,835
Hey.

144
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:14,004
Get lost, why don't you?

145
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:23,513
Down. Get your
fucking head down.

146
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:26,683
I got a license for that.

147
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:32,564
Cut me some slack. I
used to be a cop.

148
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:34,858
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.

149
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:37,360
They call me Buzz.

150
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:41,031
I don't give a rat's ass what they
call you. Keep your head down.

151
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,159
And stay there, Buzz.

152
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:48,830
- You okay?
- She's fine.

153
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,624
I'm not asking you, sir.

154
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,046
- Somebody hit you?
- It's not what you think.

155
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,383
What is it, then?

156
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:03,970
You got the wrong idea, mister.
I'm fine.

157
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:07,349
But it's nice to know you care.

158
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,734
Drive safely.

159
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:20,445
What's going on?

160
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:27,661
- You know him?
- Yeah, I've seen him around.

161
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:30,539
He used to be a cop.

162
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,756
They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on a Christmas tree.

163
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,551
All right. Put your
camera right there.

164
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:47,013
When I walk out, I'll stop here. Get
the movie premiere in the background.

165
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:50,100
I like it. I like it. "The
Movie Premiere Pot Bust."

166
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:53,353
When I walk out, I don't want
those floodlights in my eyes.

167
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:56,106
Big V, consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?

168
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:58,608
All right, come on. Get down.

169
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,656
Go. Pop them.

170
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,244
Freeze. Police.

171
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,915
Hold it. Come on.
Come on, let's go.

172
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,292
I got my family coming...

173
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,753
- it'll be a nice Christmas gift.
- Hi, Tammy. Hi, Matt.

174
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:20,005
Right over here.

175
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,257
- Just turn.
- Hold it. Got it.

176
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:27,387
- "The Movie Premiere Pot Bust."
- Take them in. I'll get the evidence.

177
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,152
It's Christmas Eve in
the City of Angels...

178
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,572
and while decent citizens sleep
the sleep of the righteous...

179
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:48,199
hopheads prowl for marijuana...

180
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,745
not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them:

181
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,665
Celebrity crime-stopper
Jack Vincennes...

182
00:12:55,833 --> 00:13:00,629
scourge of grasshoppers and
dope fiends everywhere.

183
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:03,173
You like it, Jackie boy?

184
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,635
Yeah, subtle.

185
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:08,345
What took you?

186
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:11,389
My partner stopped to help
a damsel in distress.

187
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:14,225
His priorities are
all screwed up.

188
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,186
Up to your old
tricks again, Bud?

189
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:17,687
Bye.

190
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:21,566
Hollywood Jack, what brings you
to our humble station house?

191
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,526
- How are you?
- What are you doing here?

192
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:25,695
You know me. Keeping the
streets safe, boys.

193
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,365
Take these two, get them
dressed and book them.

194
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:31,284
- The party's upstairs.
- Okay, I'll be right up. Exley.

195
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,500
What's that for?

196
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:41,169
Well, you are watch commander
tonight, aren't you?

197
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,420
Yeah. So?

198
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:46,091
A gratuity from Hush-Hush magazine.
Buy yourself a new pair of loafers.

199
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,802
No, thanks, Jack. You
keep your payoff.

200
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,720
I'm not interested.

201
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:01,815
- What the hell's this?
- Six spics.

202
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,360
Mexicans, sir. The ones who
assaulted Brown and Helenowski.

203
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:08,530
I heard Helenowski lost six pints
of blood and Brown's in a coma.

204
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:10,407
They're home with bruises.

205
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:13,326
- That's not what I heard.
- Get these men into the lockup.

206
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:18,289
Stens, you guys hear what those taco
benders did to Helenowski and Brown?

207
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:24,087
Helenowski lost an eye, and they're
reading Brown his last rites.

208
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:29,175
That ought to make for a very merry
Christmas for Helenowski and Brown.

209
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:33,555
Hey, guys. Guys. They
brought the Mexicans in.

210
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:36,266
They're downstairs.

211
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:41,438
- Let's do it.
- Come on, guys. Let's get them.

212
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,067
Stensland, the party's upstairs.

213
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:49,404
This doesn't concern you.

214
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,949
Come on, guys. Haven't
you got work to do?

215
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,284
Go back to the party.

216
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:58,788
- Come on, it's Christmas. Help me out.
- Out of the way. Move it.

217
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:03,084
- I just got a few more questions.
- You don't all have to be down here.

218
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:04,627
Go.

219
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:10,467
Hey, White? You better put a leash on
your partner before he kills somebody.

220
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:15,597
Teach him a lesson.
Get him, Stens.

221
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,808
This is for ours, Pancho.

222
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,311
Get him, Stens.

223
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:22,645
Let me through.

224
00:15:24,482 --> 00:15:25,940
No. He didn't do nothing.

225
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,777
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

226
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:31,988
- Tell that Mexican to shut up.
- Move. Move.

227
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:33,448
You're sick.

228
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,494
Stens!

229
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:41,247
- Stens. Hey. Hey. Come on. Come on.
- Don't break it up.

230
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:43,208
Get back. Get back.

231
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,336
- Yeah, and fuck your mother.
- Fuck you.

232
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:51,424
- Come on!
- Stop, officer. That's an order.

233
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,095
Hey.

234
00:15:57,014 --> 00:15:58,890
Yeah, all right.

235
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:02,936
- You're all going in my report.
- Let's go, Exley.

236
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:23,373
"Bloody Christmas."

237
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:26,417
The press love to label.

238
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:30,046
You should know this is
bigger than the police board.

239
00:16:30,214 --> 00:16:34,384
The grand jury's convening.
Indictments may be handed down.

240
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:37,387
- Will you testify?
- No, sir. I won't.

241
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:42,684
District Attorney Loew?

242
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:46,688
You and Officer Stensland brought
the liquor to the station.

243
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:49,190
Stensland was already drunk.

244
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:52,235
Do you see how appearing as a
voluntary witness against him...

245
00:16:52,403 --> 00:16:54,988
could offset the damage
you've done to yourself?

246
00:16:55,156 --> 00:16:57,907
Sir, I won't testify against
my partner or anyone else.

247
00:16:58,075 --> 00:17:00,076
This man is a disgrace.

248
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:04,080
Your badge and gun, officer.
You're suspended from duty.

249
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,458
Dismissed.

250
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,601
Ed.

251
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:27,979
We need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the department.

252
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,523
- I'm asking you...
- Justice has to be served.

253
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,275
Of course I'll testify.

254
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:38,406
I'm glad you feel that way, Edmund.
Most of the men don't.

255
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:41,284
They think silence and
integrity are the same thing.

256
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:46,748
Not exactly the image of the new L.A.P.D.
we're trying to create.

257
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:49,918
Welcome to Los Angeles,
the city of the future.

258
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:52,712
- May I make a suggestion, sir?
- By all means.

259
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,632
The public will expect the
department to protect its own...

260
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,135
and sweep this under the carpet.
Don't.

261
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:02,597
Shift the guilt to men whose
pensions are secured.

262
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:04,474
Force them to retire.

263
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:11,147
But somebody has to swing, so
indict, try and convict...

264
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,149
Richard Stensland and Bud White.

265
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:17,153
Secure them jail time. The
message will be very clear:

266
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:20,156
This department,
your new L.A.P.D...

267
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:23,493
will not tolerate officers who
think they're above the law.

268
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:26,704
Dick Stensland is an
embarrassment as a policeman.

269
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:30,583
He's had rotten fitness reports
from every CO he's served under...

270
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:33,169
but Bud White is a
valuable officer.

271
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:35,004
White's a mindless thug.

272
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:36,965
No, Edmund.

273
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:41,177
He's just a man who can answer "yes"
to those questions I've asked you.

274
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:44,764
The department and the
public need role models.

275
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:48,017
Clean-cut, forthright men
the public can admire.

276
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:52,772
Sergeant, I'll promote you...

277
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:56,234
to lieutenant,
effective immediately.

278
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:57,694
Detective lieutenant.

279
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:01,572
Ed, you're 30.

280
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,493
Your father didn't make
lieutenant until he was 33.

281
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:06,786
I know that, sir.

282
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:09,664
I also know when he made
lieutenant, it was as a detective.

283
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,250
Before we start polishing
our laurels...

284
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:15,044
it'd look better if we had
a corroborative witness.

285
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:19,007
That won't be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.

286
00:19:19,216 --> 00:19:21,050
Jack Vincennes.

287
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:23,970
He hit one of the Mexicans
and saw the whole thing.

288
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:27,807
A veteran like Vincennes might be
willing to admit his own culpability...

289
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:30,560
but he'd never rat out
a fellow officer.

290
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:34,272
Jack's the technical adviser
on "Badge of Honor".

291
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:35,815
He lives for it.

292
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,734
That's the way to get to him.

293
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:43,406
I'd like you to observe, Ed.

294
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:48,661
Call Sergeant Vincennes.

295
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,913
Bright kid.

296
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:53,082
You may well reap
the benefit, Ed...

297
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,169
but are you prepared to be
despised in the department?

298
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:58,254
Yes, sir, I am.

299
00:20:00,257 --> 00:20:01,257
So be it.

300
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:09,849
Well, sergeant, we'll
get right to it.

301
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:14,354
Nine civilian witnesses have identified
you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.

302
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:16,939
But we have a stellar witness
who will name names...

303
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:20,735
and also testify that you hit
back only after being hit.

304
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:24,113
- And?
- And you will testify against three officers...

305
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:26,240
who have already earned
their pension...

306
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:29,035
and plead ignorance to
questions at the other men.

307
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,454
No, thanks. I'm not a snitch.

308
00:20:31,622 --> 00:20:35,124
I'll guarantee you a slap on the
wrist, a brief suspension...

309
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:38,628
followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Vice.

310
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:41,714
When you transfer out of Vice,
you'll be back on the show.

311
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,762
The show?

312
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:49,972
"Badge of Honor", Vincennes.

313
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:54,394
We need to tone down
your profile for a bit.

314
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,646
Jack...

315
00:20:56,814 --> 00:21:01,109
I doubt you've ever taken a stupid breath.
Don't start now.

316
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:02,944
Okay, I'll do it.

317
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:09,075
The grand jury will hear
your testimony tomorrow.

318
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:10,660
Dismissed, Vincennes.

319
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:23,923
And so it goes...

320
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,175
detective lieutenant.

321
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:30,430
Ace them at the grand
jury tomorrow, son.

322
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:33,433
Wear a smart-looking
suit and ace them.

323
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:37,353
And, Ed, lose the glasses.

324
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:50,450
So you're the stellar witness.

325
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:54,287
I should have known. What's
the chief throwing you?

326
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,790
- Throwing me?
- Yeah, Exley, what's the payoff?

327
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,959
You're the payoff expert.

328
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:01,419
I'm just doing my duty.

329
00:22:01,628 --> 00:22:05,173
Come on, you're playing an angle
here, college boy, right?

330
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,509
You're getting something so you
don't have to hobnob with cops...

331
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:10,511
who are gonna hate
you for snitching.

332
00:22:10,888 --> 00:22:13,473
Well, if they're making
you detective, watch out.

333
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:15,892
Some bureau guys are
gonna burn in this...

334
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:18,227
and you're gonna work
with friends of theirs.

335
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:19,812
What about you?

336
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,233
I'm snitching three old-timers who'll
be fishing in Oregon next week.

337
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:26,486
Next to you, I'm clean...

338
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:27,904
and smart.

339
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:30,740
Edmund J. Exley to chambers.

340
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:34,118
And remember...

341
00:22:34,328 --> 00:22:37,788
Bud White will fuck you for this if
it takes him the rest of his life.

342
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:43,252
Captain, what do you want?

343
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:45,671
Call me Dudley.

344
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:49,342
Dudley, what do you want?

345
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:54,096
Look, lad, I admire your
refusal to testify...

346
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:56,516
and your loyalty
to your partner.

347
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:58,976
I admire you as a policeman...

348
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:03,606
particularly your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job.

349
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:07,026
And I'm most impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters.

350
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,278
Do you hate them, Wendell?

351
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:13,032
What do you want?

352
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:18,955
They're yours.

353
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:22,208
Go ahead, take them.

354
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:26,337
There's no goddamn bill on me?

355
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:29,131
- Four witnesses recanted their testimony.
- Why?

356
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,634
- They had a change of heart.
- What about Stensland?

357
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:33,719
Your partner's through.

358
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:36,097
Departmental scapegoat
on the chief's orders.

359
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,224
A year from his pension.

360
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:42,353
Exley.

361
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,605
Exley made his play and
got what he wanted.

362
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:48,150
As a politician, he
exceeds even myself.

363
00:23:48,986 --> 00:23:51,821
The department needs
smart men like Exley...

364
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:55,575
and direct men like you.

365
00:23:56,994 --> 00:24:00,997
Look, lad, I need you for an assignment
the chief's given me the go-ahead on.

366
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:05,459
A duty few men are fit for,
but you were born for.

367
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:08,796
You'd be working out of
Homicide down at City Hall.

368
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:10,172
Homicide?

369
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:12,675
Working cases?

370
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:16,429
Your talents lie
elsewhere, Wendell.

371
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:18,639
It's a muscle job.

372
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,021
You'll do as I say and ask no questions.
Do you follow my drift?

373
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:27,356
In Technicolor, sir.

374
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,903
Meet Tony Brancato and
Anthony Trombino...

375
00:24:33,113 --> 00:24:36,407
two rising lieutenants in
the Mickey Cohen rackets.

376
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:38,659
With the dapper little
gent in prison...

377
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:43,039
who knows how far they'll go?
The sky's the limit.

378
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:50,713
Oh, well.

379
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:08,272
Meet Deuce Perkins, Mickey
Cohen's narcotics lieutenant.

380
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:09,899
Could he be behind the hits?

381
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:13,486
Is he consolidating
organized-crime power?

382
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:21,243
I suppose not.

383
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,292
One thing's for sure:

384
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:31,754
Two-man triggers are punching the
tickets on the Mickster's muscle.

385
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:45,017
Meanwhile, rumor has
it the L.A.P.D...

386
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:50,064
has set up a not-so-welcome wagon to
dishearten out-of-town criminal element...

387
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:53,567
from filling the void
left by Mickey's absence.

388
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:56,696
When I know more, dear
readers, so will you.

389
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:59,615
Off the record, on the q. t...

390
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:03,619
and very hush-hush.

391
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:08,791
With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los
Angeles is organized-crime free.

392
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:10,876
The chief wants to
keep it that way.

393
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:15,214
Now, in Cleveland, you're an
organized-crime associate...

394
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:19,218
in desperate needs of re-education
in the ways of polite society.

395
00:26:21,638 --> 00:26:23,431
I hear things.

396
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,599
Like those two-man
shooter teams.

397
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:29,645
Bang, bang. They're eighty-sixing Cohen's
lieutenants. Tell me, what do you want?

398
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,231
We want you to go home.

399
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:38,612
Picture-book smut, gentlemen.

400
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:42,491
There's been a bunch of this found
at collateral crime scenes lately.

401
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:47,788
Quality ranges from piss-poor
to very well done.

402
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,417
- Look who's back from suspension.
- Here, Jack.

403
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:53,627
We're honored, Sergeant Jack.

404
00:26:53,837 --> 00:26:57,256
Ah, look at that. The great
jerk-off case of 1953.

405
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:59,800
There someplace you'd
rather be, Vincennes?

406
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:03,512
Yeah, working Narcotics,
looking for Cohen's missing H.

407
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,892
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin
would get you plenty of ink.

408
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:10,561
Maybe you should've thought of
that before "Bloody Christmas."

409
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:11,854
Oh.

410
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:14,190
Make a major case, sergeant.

411
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:16,859
It's the only way you're
getting out of here.

412
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:19,028
Dismissed, gentlemen.

413
00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:29,163
Go get the facts, Jack.

414
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,207
Just the facts.

415
00:27:38,715 --> 00:27:40,257
Whatever you desire.

416
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:43,219
Hi. I'd like to get a
delivery to Beverly Hills.

417
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,512
I don't know you.

418
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:48,224
Well, a friend just gave me this number
and I just wanted to find out if...

419
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,605
Ginger, you grab a reverse directory
and shag a name and address for me?

420
00:27:54,815 --> 00:27:56,732
Crestview 2239.

421
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,325
Hush-Hush, off the
record, on the q.t.

422
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:08,494
Sid, it's Vincennes.

423
00:28:08,662 --> 00:28:12,081
Jackie! Hey, you back on Narco?
I need some good copy.

424
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:14,333
No, but I do have something
going with Vice.

425
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:16,126
Something juicy for the Sidster?

426
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:18,587
Tracking porn. Arty,
high-class stuff.

427
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:21,924
What do you know about Fleur-de-Lis?
Slogan's "Whatever you desire."

428
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:23,717
No, I've heard bupkes.

429
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:27,596
Get me some Narco skinny. I want
to do an all-hophead issue.

430
00:28:27,764 --> 00:28:31,684
Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.
You like it?

431
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:34,186
Yeah, I'll talk to you later, Sid.
What do you got?

432
00:28:34,354 --> 00:28:37,439
- Number's not assigned, sergeant.
- Thanks, Ginger.

433
00:28:39,276 --> 00:28:40,609
A bootleg.

434
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:49,118
Hey.

435
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:50,911
Take it easy.

436
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:52,580
Tough break, Stens.

437
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:54,915
Good man. We're gonna
miss you around here.

438
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,792
Raw deal, Stensland.

439
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:01,964
Here comes the snitch.

440
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:14,768
Sorry about that, lieutenant.

441
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:33,579
Stay out of trouble, Bud.

442
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:38,292
I got a couple hours.
I'll buy you a drink.

443
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,628
- Rain check. No, I got a hot date.
- Come on.

444
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:44,840
Yeah? Who is she and what
did you arrest her for?

445
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,717
It's confidential.

446
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:51,847
Like that magazine that
Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush.

447
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:54,850
I'll see you later in the week.

448
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:57,394
We'll do the town, on me.

449
00:29:57,604 --> 00:30:00,606
Yeah. I'll bring my
wallet just in case.

450
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:07,112
- See you tomorrow.
- Hang on a minute.

451
00:30:07,948 --> 00:30:09,365
I'll walk down with you.

452
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,709
Punk kid. Who the hell
is he trying to impress?

453
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:25,381
- Yeah, I wonder.
- Got himself a real career going.

454
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:32,054
Sergeant Williams,
pick up, please.

455
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:34,890
Sergeant Williams?

456
00:30:38,144 --> 00:30:40,980
Is there anybody up
there in Homicide?

457
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:43,565
Anybody there?

458
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,027
Lieutenant Exley.

459
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:49,196
You've got a homicide downtown.

460
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:53,659
- The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
- I got it. It's mine.

461
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:08,048
Sir, at least one person's dead.
I stopped for coffee.

462
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:10,592
No one comes through the front door.
Understand?

463
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,469
Yes, sir.

464
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:49,983
I want barricades at both ends
of the street. Make sure...

465
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:53,612
Sir? I took the call.
It's my case.

466
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:56,448
You don't want it, Edmund,
and you can't have it.

467
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:59,660
- I took the call.
- It's mine.

468
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:01,370
I'll make you my
second-in-command.

469
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:03,372
Captain Smith?
Over here, please.

470
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,375
- The back door.
- Nobody else inside.

471
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:10,546
Looks like the cook drew a
handgun and set it off.

472
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:12,631
The rest were killed
in the men's room.

473
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:18,303
Sir...

474
00:33:18,555 --> 00:33:22,307
we got a total of 15 spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.

475
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:26,687
I'm betting three men, five-shot capacity
pumps, all of them emptying once.

476
00:33:26,855 --> 00:33:29,815
Excuse me, sir, we got an
ID on one of the victims.

477
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,817
It's Dick Stensland.

478
00:33:34,404 --> 00:33:36,947
When I first saw her, I thought
she was Rita Hayworth.

479
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:38,574
Yeah, me too.

480
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,419
Hell of a way to avoid
a prison sentence.

481
00:34:01,097 --> 00:34:02,389
You tell me what happened?

482
00:34:02,932 --> 00:34:05,517
Appears three men held
up a coffee shop.

483
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:08,562
The guy at the register pulled
a .38, so they killed him.

484
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:12,441
Then they took everyone else
out back and killed them too.

485
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:16,778
Lieutenant, we're ready
with that Nite Owl ID.

486
00:34:22,285 --> 00:34:24,244
Is this your daughter, Mrs.
Lefferts?

487
00:34:24,954 --> 00:34:26,622
I don't know.

488
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:30,083
We know this is difficult.
Just take your time.

489
00:34:31,794 --> 00:34:34,129
It seems like my Susan...

490
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:37,257
but my Susan was a
blond, not a redhead.

491
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:39,301
When was the last
time you saw her?

492
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,762
Just before Christmas.

493
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:45,224
We'd fought. I didn't
like her boyfriend.

494
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:49,770
Mrs. Lefferts, does your daughter have
any distinguishing characteristics?

495
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:53,774
You got the wrong idea, mister.
I'm fine.

496
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:57,778
She has a birthmark on her hip.

497
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:05,160
It's her.

498
00:35:05,828 --> 00:35:07,955
My baby.

499
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:13,001
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.

500
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,588
Who's in charge of
this investigation?

501
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:18,507
Captain Smith and myself. Why?

502
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:22,594
"The Nite Owl Massacre."

503
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:24,554
Hyperbole aside...

504
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:28,433
this is a heinous crime that
requires swift resolution.

505
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:30,477
Six victims.

506
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:33,355
One of them one of our own.
Dick Stensland.

507
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:37,943
As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

508
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:40,320
Robbery is the likely motive.

509
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,614
We have rubber-glove
smears on the register...

510
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:46,743
and preliminary forensics strongly
tend towards a trio of shooters.

511
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,954
We do have one hot
lead, so listen well.

512
00:35:49,372 --> 00:35:51,331
Three Negro juveniles...

513
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:55,168
were seen discharging shotguns
last night in Griffith Park.

514
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:59,423
A park ranger ID'd them as driving
a 1948 to 1950 Mercury coupe...

515
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:01,008
maroon in color.

516
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:05,178
An hour ago, a canvassing crew
turned up a news vendor...

517
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:09,057
who saw a maroon Merc parked across
from the Nite Owl around 1 a.m.

518
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,353
DMV has come up with a
registration list of Merc coupes.

519
00:36:14,564 --> 00:36:19,067
Forty-eight two-man teams will
shake three names apiece.

520
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:22,362
Interrogations will be led
by Lieutenant Edmund Exley.

521
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:27,576
Enough on that.

522
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:34,082
Gentlemen, just go out and get them.
Use all necessary force.

523
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:37,419
The people of Los
Angeles demand it.

524
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:39,379
Dismissed.

525
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:44,760
Why not just put a
bounty on them?

526
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,352
You ready to roll?

527
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:55,270
Take them. I got
something I gotta do.

528
00:36:55,438 --> 00:36:59,107
- What if one of these names...?
- Get somebody else.

529
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:02,194
Well, I got our
assignments, Big V.

530
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:05,447
We go by this list, we got zero
chance of making this collar.

531
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:08,283
I got a guy who knows what's
going on south of Jefferson.

532
00:37:08,451 --> 00:37:11,745
- He can put us at fifty-fifty.
- Jack, what are you doing?

533
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:14,790
Same sort of thing that got
you in trouble last time.

534
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:16,416
I'll take those odds.

535
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:21,963
We got it from here.

536
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,635
Between the two of you, you
should bring a photographer.

537
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:35,143
I need an address on a customer of yours.
Her name is Lynn.

538
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:37,145
- That's all I got to go on?
- Yeah.

539
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,981
I think you already know who
I mean, so cough it up.

540
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:43,485
There's a billing address
and a delivery address.

541
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:11,972
Are you Pierce Patchett?

542
00:38:13,015 --> 00:38:14,349
I am.

543
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:20,480
Are you soliciting for police charities?
Last time you called at my office.

544
00:38:20,857 --> 00:38:23,817
Go on down to the driveway.
We'll talk there.

545
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:36,371
What can I do for you?

546
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:41,001
- Where were you last night?
- I was here hosting a party.

547
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:46,840
- Tell me about Dick Stensland.
- I don't know him, Mr ...?

548
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,550
Officer White.

549
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:50,886
Sue Lefferts? You know her?

550
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,513
You know I do. You
saw me with her.

551
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:56,892
How did you find me?

552
00:38:57,518 --> 00:39:01,688
Nick's Liquor. This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

553
00:39:01,898 --> 00:39:03,523
Of course.

554
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:08,570
Sue Lefferts died
at the Nite Owl.

555
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:10,864
I'm investigating.

556
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:16,912
- Everything all right?
- Fine, Phillip. Thank you.

557
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,668
What happened to the
other guy, Buzz?

558
00:39:23,836 --> 00:39:26,254
Buzz Meeks no longer
works for me.

559
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:29,007
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas
Eve but didn't act it.

560
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:32,177
I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket. She is...

561
00:39:32,345 --> 00:39:34,930
Was a big doubles fan.

562
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:38,767
You're a known associate of a
woman killed in a mass murder.

563
00:39:39,602 --> 00:39:42,062
Wanna go downtown and
discuss this officially?

564
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,939
Is that what this is? Official?

565
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:49,277
Somehow I have the feeling this is
more personal with you, Mr. White.

566
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,074
All right, then...

567
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:59,371
are you concerned about criminal matters
peripheral to the Nite Owl murders?

568
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:02,958
- Not at the moment.
- You wouldn't feel obligated to report them?

569
00:40:05,294 --> 00:40:07,462
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

570
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:10,632
I needed a Rita Hayworth to
fill out my little studio.

571
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,967
What little studio?

572
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:15,804
Well, there's Gardner,
Russell, Monroe, Turner...

573
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:18,306
Lynn Bracken is
my Veronica Lake.

574
00:40:18,808 --> 00:40:21,309
I use girls that look
like movie stars.

575
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:24,104
Sometimes I employ
a plastic surgeon.

576
00:40:24,647 --> 00:40:27,107
When the work had been done,
that's when you saw us.

577
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,651
That's why her mother
couldn't ID her.

578
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:32,737
Jesus fucking Christ.

579
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:34,990
No, Mr. White, Pierce
Morehouse Patchett.

580
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:40,829
I sense you're on your best behavior,
but that's all I'm gonna tell you.

581
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,331
If you persist, I'll meet
you with my attorney.

582
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,668
Now, would you like
Lynn Bracken's address?

583
00:40:46,836 --> 00:40:48,503
I got her address.

584
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:51,840
Find Susan's killer, Mr. White.

585
00:40:52,341 --> 00:40:54,467
I'll give you a handsome reward.

586
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,891
Whatever you desire.

587
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:10,942
Come on. I know
you're not asleep.

588
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:15,363
You talking to me?
What do you want?

589
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:17,198
My 5 bucks.

590
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:19,826
It was the only one I had.

591
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:21,202
Right now?

592
00:41:21,704 --> 00:41:24,205
Hey, doll face, tell
him to leave us alone.

593
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:26,708
I understand. Okay, fine.

594
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,377
Oh, baby...

595
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:32,047
bad news.

596
00:41:32,214 --> 00:41:33,381
You have to go.

597
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:34,716
Go?

598
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:37,719
Something very important has
come up and you have to go...

599
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:40,639
but I'll make it
up to you, okay?

600
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,391
I will, I promise. Excuse me.

601
00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:47,354
Is it the cops?

602
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:54,402
Miss Bracken, I'm Officer White.

603
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,197
I've been expecting you,
just not this soon.

604
00:41:57,365 --> 00:42:00,075
Pierce called. He told
me what happened to Sue.

605
00:42:00,242 --> 00:42:03,411
Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?

606
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:05,580
Hit the road, pal.

607
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,541
Maybe I will...

608
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:10,543
maybe I won't.

609
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,547
L.A.P.D., shit-bird. Get out of here or
I'll call your wife to come get you.

610
00:42:31,107 --> 00:42:32,691
- Officer.
- Councilman.

611
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:54,796
- Would you care for a drink?
- Yeah, Scotch straight.

612
00:43:00,594 --> 00:43:04,264
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't friends.

613
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:05,932
You know what I mean?

614
00:43:06,308 --> 00:43:07,976
You sorry she's dead?

615
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,271
Of course I am.

616
00:43:11,605 --> 00:43:13,481
What kind of question is that?

617
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:17,944
Do you know why Pierce
is humoring you?

618
00:43:18,154 --> 00:43:20,488
Use words like that,
you might make me mad.

619
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:23,450
- But do you know?
- Yeah, I know.

620
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:29,581
Patchett's running whores cut
to look like movie stars.

621
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,293
And judging by his address, probably
something bigger on the side.

622
00:43:33,461 --> 00:43:35,336
He doesn't want any attention.

623
00:43:35,629 --> 00:43:39,174
That's right. Our motives are
selfish, so we're cooperating.

624
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:42,260
So cooperate. Why was Susan
Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

625
00:43:42,678 --> 00:43:45,305
I don't know. I never heard
of the Nite Owl till today.

626
00:43:45,473 --> 00:43:48,433
- How did she meet Patchett?
- Pierce meets people.

627
00:43:48,642 --> 00:43:52,479
Sue came on a bus with dreams of Hollywood
and this is how they turned out.

628
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:56,858
Thanks to Pierce, we still
get to act a little.

629
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,694
Tell me about Pierce.

630
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:02,113
He's waiting for you
to mention money.

631
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:06,493
- You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
- It's Lynn.

632
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:11,331
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to
fucking bribe me or threaten me...

633
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:14,125
or I'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.

634
00:44:15,211 --> 00:44:17,670
I remember you from
Christmas Eve.

635
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:22,050
You have a thing for helping
women, don't you, Officer White?

636
00:44:22,885 --> 00:44:24,677
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

637
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:28,348
- You say "fuck" a lot.
- You fuck for money.

638
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:32,185
There's blood on your shirt. Is
that an integral part of your job?

639
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:34,062
- Yeah.
- Do you enjoy it?

640
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,981
- When they deserve it.
- Did they deserve it today?

641
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:39,734
I'm not sure.

642
00:44:39,902 --> 00:44:41,402
- But you did it anyway.
- Yeah.

643
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:44,405
Just like the half-dozen
guys you screwed today.

644
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:47,742
Well, actually, it was only two.

645
00:44:50,204 --> 00:44:52,163
You're different, Officer White.

646
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:56,876
You're the first man in five years who
didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake.

647
00:44:57,044 --> 00:44:58,837
You look better
than Veronica Lake.

648
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:05,426
Pierce Patchett?

649
00:45:07,096 --> 00:45:09,931
He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.

650
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:13,268
He doesn't let us use narcotics
and he doesn't abuse us.

651
00:45:13,602 --> 00:45:17,772
Can your policeman's mentality
grasp those contradictions?

652
00:45:19,608 --> 00:45:21,943
He had you cut to look
like Veronica Lake.

653
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:23,570
No.

654
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:26,906
I'm really a brunette,
but the rest is me.

655
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:31,077
And that's all the news
that's fit to print.

656
00:45:32,288 --> 00:45:34,706
It was nice meeting
you, officer.

657
00:45:38,961 --> 00:45:42,755
- I'd like to see you again.
- You asking for a date, or an appointment?

658
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:46,050
I don't know.

659
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:49,888
- For a date, I should know your first name.
- Forget I asked.

660
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:52,432
It was a mistake.

661
00:46:12,995 --> 00:46:14,454
Leonard Bidwell?

662
00:46:15,623 --> 00:46:17,624
Come on down here
and talk to us.

663
00:46:19,668 --> 00:46:22,587
- How's the left these days?
- What's it to you?

664
00:46:22,755 --> 00:46:26,466
Oh, I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.
I like your style.

665
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:30,845
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?

666
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:34,182
You got a brother in Folsom.
I know, I put him there.

667
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,433
Until 19-fucking-70.

668
00:46:35,643 --> 00:46:37,685
How'd you like to make it 1960?

669
00:46:37,978 --> 00:46:40,355
I know the judge, and
Lieutenant Exley here...

670
00:46:40,522 --> 00:46:42,690
is very good friends
with the DA.

671
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:45,068
Yeah.

672
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,696
We're looking for three colored
guys who like to pop off shotguns.

673
00:46:48,864 --> 00:46:51,032
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe.

674
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:54,535
- Wanna give me a snitch jacket?
- Wanna buy your brother 10 years?

675
00:46:54,703 --> 00:46:56,621
- It was 10 years, right?
- Yeah, 10 years.

676
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:00,041
You don't have to say anything,
just look at this list...

677
00:47:00,376 --> 00:47:01,876
and point.

678
00:47:04,213 --> 00:47:06,214
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.

679
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:08,049
Sugar Ray Collins.

680
00:47:08,217 --> 00:47:10,510
Drives a maroon '49 coupe.

681
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,679
Beautiful ride.

682
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:17,558
Don't know about shotguns, but he
gets his thrills killing dogs.

683
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:19,143
He's righteous trash.

684
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:22,730
Look at that. It's five
minutes from here. Thanks.

685
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,401
So I'll hear from you, right?

686
00:47:27,403 --> 00:47:31,364
- About my brother?
- Keep it up, Lenny. Up.

687
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:39,664
There it is. It's in the back.

688
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:59,559
- One of ours.
- Shit, somebody beat us here.

689
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,191
- Damn it.
- What?

690
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,278
- My glasses.
- You're kidding.

691
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,781
Well, just don't shoot me.

692
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,417
What are you guys doing here?

693
00:48:25,419 --> 00:48:27,128
We were just in
the neighborhood.

694
00:48:27,296 --> 00:48:28,296
What do you got?

695
00:48:28,464 --> 00:48:31,883
Three 12-gauge pumps, an empty box
of double-aught buck, and some cash.

696
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:36,971
So long, Vice. "Badge
of Honor", here I come.

697
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:40,308
- Fuck you, Vincennes. This is our collar.
- Quiet.

698
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:44,145
I'm ranking officer here. We go as a team.
End of story.

699
00:48:49,443 --> 00:48:50,485
Yeah, right.

700
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,448
- How many ways in?
- Only one. Up the stairs.

701
00:48:56,825 --> 00:48:58,826
He's very serious.

702
00:49:13,342 --> 00:49:15,510
- Police.
- Don't shoot.

703
00:49:15,677 --> 00:49:17,261
No!

704
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:18,679
- Don't move.
- Ace him, Jack.

705
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,182
- Shut up.
- Anxious, aren't you?

706
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,475
Don't kill them.

707
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,313
- Hey.
- Back, back, back.

708
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:31,025
- Man, get off me.
- Against the wall. Against the wall.

709
00:49:31,193 --> 00:49:33,528
- Put your hands up.
- Get over there. Come on.

710
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:36,489
Now, shut up. Hands
behind your back.

711
00:49:37,658 --> 00:49:38,699
So...

712
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:42,036
how's it feel getting
out of the office?

713
00:49:48,043 --> 00:49:49,710
This just came up
from Forensics.

714
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,379
"Burning clothes.

715
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,715
Casitas Youth Camp ..."

716
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:02,306
- it's crowded in here, White.
- These guys killed Stensland.

717
00:50:18,907 --> 00:50:21,742
Ejection marks on the shells
from the suspects' shotguns...

718
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,079
are identical to the marks on the
shell casings at the Nite Owl.

719
00:50:25,414 --> 00:50:27,415
I want confessions, Edmund.

720
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:30,585
A night's stewing ought
to have softened them up.

721
00:50:31,003 --> 00:50:32,753
Oh, I'll break them, sir.

722
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:55,776
Are you sure Golden Boy
is up to the task, cap?

723
00:50:56,445 --> 00:50:59,447
Oh, I think you'd be surprised
what the lad is capable of.

724
00:51:01,783 --> 00:51:03,743
You're 22. Aren't you, Ray?

725
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:10,958
Did one of the officers
work you over?

726
00:51:13,378 --> 00:51:16,297
- You're 22, right?
- Why do you keep asking that?

727
00:51:16,465 --> 00:51:18,883
Twenty-two makes it a
gas-chamber bounce.

728
00:51:19,301 --> 00:51:21,761
You should've pulled
this caper years ago.

729
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:25,139
Get life, do a little
Youth Authority jolt...

730
00:51:25,307 --> 00:51:27,225
transfer to Folsom a big man.

731
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:31,562
- Get yourself a sissy...
- Hey, I don't truck with no sissies.

732
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:37,276
- Louis.
- What?

733
00:51:38,904 --> 00:51:41,489
You did the Casitas
Youth Camp with Louis.

734
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,576
Why do you keep asking me about Louis?
His business is his business.

735
00:51:45,744 --> 00:51:49,247
Sugar, Louis told me you
went sissy up at Casitas.

736
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:53,501
You couldn't do the time, so you got
a big white boy to look after you.

737
00:51:53,669 --> 00:51:58,339
Said they called you "Sugar"
because you gave it out so sweet.

738
00:51:59,174 --> 00:52:03,344
Louis gave it up at Casitas, man.
I was the boss jock in my dorm.

739
00:52:03,512 --> 00:52:04,595
Louis was the sissy.

740
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:09,016
Louis gave it up for fucking candy bars.
He ain't got the sense of a goddamn dog.

741
00:52:10,102 --> 00:52:14,105
- I heard you like to shoot dogs.
- Dogs got no reason to live.

742
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:19,527
- You feel the same way about people too?
- What you trying to say?

743
00:52:19,945 --> 00:52:23,114
- We got the shotguns, Ray.
- I don't own no shotguns.

744
00:52:23,282 --> 00:52:25,658
Why were you throwing
clothes in the incinerator?

745
00:52:25,951 --> 00:52:26,993
Say what?

746
00:52:27,494 --> 00:52:31,956
A neighbor said she saw you throwing
clothes in the backyard incinerator.

747
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:33,374
It doesn't look good.

748
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:35,710
I ain't got shit to say
till I see a judge.

749
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:39,463
Were you on hop? You were passed out
when we arrested you. You hopped up?

750
00:52:39,673 --> 00:52:42,216
Ty and Louis fuck with
that shit, not me.

751
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:44,176
Where do they get their stuff?

752
00:52:45,512 --> 00:52:46,679
- Man...
- Come on.

753
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:50,308
Give me one to feed the DA.
It'll make me look good...

754
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:54,228
and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a
punk like his sissy partners.

755
00:52:59,484 --> 00:53:00,735
All right, Raymond.

756
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:03,154
Tell me one more thing
about Jones and Fontaine.

757
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:04,822
Where do they get drugs?

758
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:09,410
Roland Navarette.

759
00:53:10,996 --> 00:53:13,664
He runs a hole-up
on Bunker Hill.

760
00:53:13,832 --> 00:53:15,833
And he sells red devils.

761
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,503
- Exley's good, I'll give him that.
- I'm gonna take a break.

762
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,594
You know, Ray, I'm talking
about the gas chamber...

763
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:30,014
and you haven't even asked
me what this is about.

764
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,309
You got a big "guilty"
sign around your neck.

765
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:41,275
That was masterful, Edmund.
This one's ready to go.

766
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:51,702
Give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.

767
00:53:51,912 --> 00:53:54,246
Take the cuffs off,
so he can read it.

768
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:58,584
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.

769
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:02,463
I think it was Ray's idea. You talk,
I think I can save your life.

770
00:54:03,924 --> 00:54:06,801
Son, six people are dead, and
someone has to pay for it.

771
00:54:06,968 --> 00:54:09,929
Now, it can be you,
or it can be Ray.

772
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:13,933
Louis, he called you queer.

773
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:18,104
- Said at Casitas, you took it up the ass.
- I didn't kill nobody!

774
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,607
Son...

775
00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:26,070
you know what's gonna happen
to you if you don't talk.

776
00:54:26,238 --> 00:54:30,157
You'll go to the gas chamber. So for
God's sake, admit what you did.

777
00:54:30,325 --> 00:54:32,076
I didn't mean to hurt her.

778
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:35,121
- Maybe she's okay.
- Okay?

779
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:39,750
These people are all in the morgue.
They were dead when you left them.

780
00:54:39,918 --> 00:54:44,463
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don't die, so I don't die.

781
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,425
She don't die, so I don't die.

782
00:54:47,592 --> 00:54:50,219
Louis, who's the girl?
What's her name?

783
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:52,388
Who are you talking about?

784
00:54:52,973 --> 00:54:54,723
Was she at the Nite Owl?

785
00:54:55,308 --> 00:54:57,643
Louis, listen to me. Was
she at the Nite Owl?

786
00:55:04,985 --> 00:55:07,528
- This newspaper shit ain't shit.
- Where's the girl?

787
00:55:07,696 --> 00:55:09,196
Did you kill her?

788
00:55:09,364 --> 00:55:11,907
You wanted Louis to lose his cherry.
That wasn't enough.

789
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,034
Things got out of hand.
You made her bleed.

790
00:55:14,202 --> 00:55:16,620
She bled on your clothes,
so you burned the clothes.

791
00:55:16,788 --> 00:55:18,706
Who told you that?

792
00:55:18,999 --> 00:55:20,458
Now, listen to me.

793
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:23,210
If that girl is alive, she's
the only chance you've got.

794
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:26,714
- I think she's alive.
- You think? Then where is she now?

795
00:55:26,882 --> 00:55:29,884
Did you leave her someplace?
Sell her out?

796
00:55:30,051 --> 00:55:31,719
- Tell me where she is.
- Move.

797
00:55:33,805 --> 00:55:36,891
What are you doing, man? Don't.

798
00:55:38,018 --> 00:55:39,059
White.

799
00:55:40,228 --> 00:55:43,731
- One in six. Where's the girl?
- White, I have this under control.

800
00:55:43,899 --> 00:55:46,442
- Put the weapon down.
- Where is the girl?

801
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:53,866
- Sylvester.
- What?

802
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:57,661
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon...

803
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:01,707
brown corner house, upstairs.

804
00:56:13,094 --> 00:56:15,387
- Captain, just give me one minute.
- You got it.

805
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:24,772
Nobody moves. The rest of
us are going in the front.

806
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,316
Stay put until I give the word.

807
00:58:52,754 --> 00:58:54,546
He went around back, sir.

808
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,634
Miss, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm sorry to ask you this.

809
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:02,805
- I need to know what time they left you.
- Get her to the hospital. Excuse me.

810
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,723
Give your career a rest.

811
00:59:05,225 --> 00:59:06,558
Leave her alone.

812
00:59:06,726 --> 00:59:09,395
A naked guy with a gun? You
expect anyone to believe that?

813
00:59:09,562 --> 00:59:11,814
Get the fuck away from me.

814
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,858
- How's it gonna look in your report?
- It'll look like justice.

815
00:59:15,026 --> 00:59:17,444
That's what the man got.
Justice.

816
00:59:17,612 --> 00:59:19,780
You don't know the
meaning of the word.

817
00:59:20,573 --> 00:59:23,867
Yeah? Well, you think it means
getting your picture in the paper.

818
00:59:24,077 --> 00:59:26,370
Go after criminals for a
change, instead of cops.

819
00:59:26,538 --> 00:59:28,706
Stensland got what he
deserved and so will you.

820
00:59:34,129 --> 00:59:35,379
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

821
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:39,967
Take it easy. Come on, Bud.

822
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:43,470
Come on. Let it go.

823
00:59:43,638 --> 00:59:45,639
It's best to stay away
when his blood is up.

824
00:59:45,807 --> 00:59:47,433
His blood's always up.

825
00:59:48,935 --> 00:59:50,978
You should stay away
from him altogether.

826
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:55,232
Raymond Collins, Ty Jones
and Louis Fontaine.

827
00:59:55,442 --> 00:59:58,152
They are considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

828
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,988
Repeat. The Nite Owl
suspects have escaped.

829
01:00:01,448 --> 01:00:03,323
How did they get out the window?

830
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,409
They jumped from
the second floor.

831
01:00:05,618 --> 01:00:08,036
Girl made her statement.
Jigs left her at midnight.

832
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:09,830
Time to be at the Nite Owl by 1.

833
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:14,293
The question was where did they get
their drugs. What was the answer?

834
01:00:14,461 --> 01:00:16,545
I haven't gotten that far yet.

835
01:00:16,796 --> 01:00:20,424
"Roland Navarette, lives on
Bunker Hill, runs a hole-up..."

836
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,094
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

837
01:00:26,139 --> 01:00:29,850
- Is something up, lieutenant?
- I need some backup. Come on.

838
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,328
- What?
- Nothing. Let's go.

839
01:00:57,837 --> 01:00:59,254
This should be it.

840
01:01:03,843 --> 01:01:05,761
404.

841
01:01:26,574 --> 01:01:28,242
Nobody moves.

842
01:01:29,244 --> 01:01:31,829
- Stay right there. You're under arrest.
- Don't shoot.

843
01:01:31,996 --> 01:01:34,915
- Please don't shoot.
- Don't move. Don't move.

844
01:02:27,093 --> 01:02:30,220
There he is. You did good, kid.

845
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:33,682
You should've seen the place. It
was a nightmare. Blood everywhere.

846
01:02:34,267 --> 01:02:36,226
Who would have thought?
Shotgun Ed.

847
01:02:36,394 --> 01:02:39,271
- Shotgun Ed.
- Somebody get him cleaned up.

848
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,148
Come on, kid.

849
01:02:43,776 --> 01:02:47,070
Edmund J. Exley has amassed
a brilliant record...

850
01:02:47,238 --> 01:02:50,407
in his seven years with the Los
Angeles Police Department.

851
01:02:50,617 --> 01:02:53,744
Recently, he evinced spectacular
bravery in the line of duty.

852
01:02:53,953 --> 01:02:56,788
It is our privilege to present
him with our highest honor:

853
01:02:57,123 --> 01:02:58,832
The Medal of Valor.

854
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,335
- What kind of car was it?
- It was a Ford.

855
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:04,338
My husband always drove a Ford.
I know what they look like.

856
01:03:04,964 --> 01:03:07,758
Excuse me, ma'am. Just the facts.
Light or dark?

857
01:03:07,926 --> 01:03:11,720
Light. And that's really
all I remember, officer.

858
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,640
Thank you, ma'am.
You've been a big help.

859
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:16,850
Cut. That's a print.

860
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,062
- Hey, Big Jack.
- He's back.

861
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:23,857
Hey. Jack's back. Ha-ha.

862
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:59,017
Tell Mr. Patchett that I have no
intention of changing my vote.

863
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:15,450
It may surprise some that a man in office
would admit to making a mistake...

864
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,704
but after due consideration...

865
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:22,541
I am changing my position on
the matter before the council.

866
01:04:24,335 --> 01:04:27,671
"Go west, America," was the
slogan of Manifest Destiny.

867
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,675
Today is that last step
westward with no stop signs...

868
01:04:31,843 --> 01:04:35,846
no traffic signals, from downtown
to the beach in 20 minutes.

869
01:05:07,253 --> 01:05:09,254
What were you gonna start with?

870
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,008
Prostitution?

871
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:16,094
Gambling?

872
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:23,602
Go back to Jersey, sonny. This
is the City of the Angels...

873
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,937
and you haven't got any wings.

874
01:05:48,795 --> 01:05:51,129
Nice to see you again.
Take care.

875
01:06:28,459 --> 01:06:31,670
I wondered when you might knock
on my door again, Officer White.

876
01:06:32,338 --> 01:06:33,672
It's Bud.

877
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:36,258
Bud.

878
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:06,705
Why me?

879
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,041
I don't know.

880
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:47,913
This election...

881
01:07:48,122 --> 01:07:51,416
is about the future of law
enforcement in Los Angeles.

882
01:07:51,584 --> 01:07:54,628
City Councilman Rogers
represents that future.

883
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,713
So let's dig deep...

884
01:07:56,881 --> 01:08:00,717
and let's get a moral man re-elected.
Ellis Loew would like a few words.

885
01:08:04,138 --> 01:08:07,891
Thank you. Thank you, Brett Chase, the
very talented star of "Badge of Honor".

886
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:14,356
Let me tell you, I am so thrilled to be
here on the set of "Badge of Honor".

887
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:16,775
Big V. Jackie.

888
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:19,736
Good to see you back.

889
01:08:19,946 --> 01:08:22,697
- How they hanging, Sid?
- Down around my ankles.

890
01:08:22,949 --> 01:08:25,951
- You tight with the DA, Jackie?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

891
01:08:26,118 --> 01:08:28,578
He tried to throw me off
the force last Christmas.

892
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:30,455
How about some
payback, big-time-?

893
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:34,834
Plus the usual $50 donation to the
Jack Vincennes retirement fund.

894
01:08:35,002 --> 01:08:38,964
- Did you know the DA was a swish?
- No kidding.

895
01:08:39,507 --> 01:08:41,132
Uh...

896
01:08:41,509 --> 01:08:44,678
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas Eve?
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust"?

897
01:08:44,845 --> 01:08:47,514
- He just got off the honor farm.
- What's he doing here?

898
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:50,976
Reynolds is acey-deucey,
not to mention broke.

899
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:53,436
I'm getting him to fuck
the DA for 100 bucks.

900
01:08:53,604 --> 01:08:56,648
That's twice the 50 you got
for wrecking his career.

901
01:08:57,358 --> 01:09:00,902
- Hey, Matt. Come here, come here.
- Jesus, don't bring him...

902
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:07,492
That's DA Loew right there.

903
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,413
Yeah.

904
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,040
You need a drink, kid?

905
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:18,211
- Yeah.
- Jack, look after him a minute.

906
01:09:18,379 --> 01:09:22,340
Matt, this is Jack. No
secrets between me and him.

907
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,015
- How you doing?
- Oh, I'm okay. How are you?

908
01:09:30,182 --> 01:09:32,434
I'm good. Yeah.

909
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:36,271
Have we, uh, met before?

910
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:39,858
Yeah.

911
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:44,362
- Was it at a party?
- Well, it was something like that.

912
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:47,574
Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

913
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:50,035
Right.

914
01:09:50,703 --> 01:09:52,203
Fleur-de-Lis.

915
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:54,789
"Whatever you desire."

916
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,709
Dope, hookers that look
like movie stars...

917
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,795
- Pierce Patchett has it all.
- Ha-ha-ha.

918
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,839
Boy, you could say that again.

919
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:08,636
Pierce, he's not like regular guys.
I mean, I dig him, but...

920
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:13,725
you know, he, um, scares me too.

921
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:17,062
Really? How?

922
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:23,109
When I came out to L.A., this isn't
exactly where I saw myself ending up.

923
01:10:24,403 --> 01:10:27,072
Yeah, well, get in line.

924
01:10:27,573 --> 01:10:29,657
That's courage, kid. Drink up.

925
01:10:33,954 --> 01:10:36,623
You know, I don't think
I should do this.

926
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,875
It's not like you
don't know how.

927
01:10:39,043 --> 01:10:41,878
And Jack here's got connections
with "Badge of Honor".

928
01:10:42,046 --> 01:10:44,130
You pull this off, there'll
be a part for you.

929
01:10:44,298 --> 01:10:47,300
I smell a comeback,
don't you, Jack?

930
01:10:49,929 --> 01:10:54,015
Go on. The DA's free. Go
introduce yourself. Go on.

931
01:10:54,433 --> 01:10:57,102
Talk to him, Jack. Tell him
about the opening on the show.

932
01:10:57,269 --> 01:11:00,522
Oh, yeah. I'm pretty sure I can
get you a part on this show.

933
01:11:00,773 --> 01:11:02,732
But, uh, that's later on.

934
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:07,404
You know, tonight, just go on over
there and pretend it's an acting job.

935
01:11:07,571 --> 01:11:10,532
- Like show biz.
- Acting, that's it.

936
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:11,783
- Right.
- Yeah.

937
01:11:11,951 --> 01:11:14,661
- No one's gonna know about this, right?
- No.

938
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:18,540
It'll be our secret.

939
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:23,128
Okay. All right.

940
01:11:23,295 --> 01:11:25,755
- Show biz.
- That's it. Go on.

941
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:32,512
Show biz. Man.

942
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,348
If Reynolds works his charms,
which I know he will...

943
01:11:35,516 --> 01:11:38,309
they'll be at the Hollywood
Center Motel, Room 203.

944
01:11:38,477 --> 01:11:40,603
Meet me there at midnight
for a photo shoot.

945
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:44,899
Maybe we can work in the
Hollywood sign this time.

946
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,903
What do you know about
Pierce Patchett?

947
01:11:49,572 --> 01:11:52,240
Patchett? I know what you know.
He's very rich.

948
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:55,660
Just invested in freeway construction,
which is gonna make him richer.

949
01:11:55,995 --> 01:11:57,078
Why do you ask?

950
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:59,372
I just keep hearing
rumors, you know.

951
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,792
High-class porn, drugs, hookers
that look like movie stars.

952
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:07,755
Ha. Patchett's what I call twilight.
He ain't queer and he ain't red.

953
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:11,634
He cannot help me in my quest
for prime "sinnuendo."

954
01:12:17,057 --> 01:12:21,227
As though "Badge of Honor" would touch
that guy with a 10-foot pole...

955
01:12:21,395 --> 01:12:24,522
after he's been Hush-Hush
cover boy twice in one year.

956
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:25,982
See you in a few hours, Sid.

957
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:30,236
Yeah, midnight. I guarantee all
kinds of illegal activity.

958
01:13:03,437 --> 01:13:05,438
- Another, Jack?
- Yeah.

959
01:13:49,984 --> 01:13:51,568
Kid?

960
01:13:57,283 --> 01:13:58,449
Matt?

961
01:13:58,993 --> 01:14:02,203
Come on, kid, you don't
have to do the...

962
01:14:33,485 --> 01:14:35,403
Thank you for what
you did for me...

963
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,531
for killing those
animals who raped me.

964
01:14:38,866 --> 01:14:41,576
Will you thank Officer
White for me, please?

965
01:14:41,869 --> 01:14:42,910
Sure.

966
01:14:44,622 --> 01:14:48,374
Seeing him come through the door is
about the only thing I remember.

967
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:49,751
Thank God.

968
01:14:51,003 --> 01:14:53,546
You remember what time the
Negroes left you, right?

969
01:14:53,881 --> 01:14:57,050
In your statement, you said
they left you at midnight.

970
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:58,384
They might have.

971
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:07,352
- What do you mean, they might have?
- I don't know what time they left me.

972
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:09,228
I wanted them dead.

973
01:15:09,563 --> 01:15:13,066
Would anyone care that they
raped a Mexican girl...

974
01:15:13,233 --> 01:15:16,277
if they hadn't killed those
white people at the Nite Owl?

975
01:15:17,237 --> 01:15:19,530
I did what I had
to do for justice.

976
01:15:19,698 --> 01:15:23,076
Inez? Exley, over here.
Smile, Inez.

977
01:15:23,994 --> 01:15:26,412
So is he your hero, Miss Soto?

978
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:31,584
Fellas, how about this? "Rape Victim
Wheeled out of Hospital by Nite Owl Hero."

979
01:15:33,921 --> 01:15:35,421
Hey.

980
01:15:37,257 --> 01:15:39,467
All they get is Veronica Lake.

981
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,971
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.

982
01:15:55,109 --> 01:15:56,192
Bisbee?

983
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:58,277
Mm-hm.

984
01:15:58,445 --> 01:15:59,987
I grew up there.

985
01:16:02,116 --> 01:16:06,619
I'm going back in a couple of
years, open up a dress shop.

986
01:16:08,622 --> 01:16:11,499
The girls in Bisbee
need a little glamour.

987
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:19,716
Where'd this come from?

988
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:24,721
When I was 12, my old man went after my
mother with a bottle. I got in the way.

989
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,307
So you saved her.

990
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,102
Not for long.

991
01:16:34,148 --> 01:16:37,442
- I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
- He tied me to the radiator.

992
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:41,362
I watched him beat my mother
to death with a tire iron...

993
01:16:43,824 --> 01:16:45,992
and he left me there.

994
01:16:48,078 --> 01:16:50,872
Three days before a
truant officer found us.

995
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:55,877
They never found the old man.

996
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,221
Is that why you became a cop?

997
01:17:08,015 --> 01:17:09,390
To get even?

998
01:17:10,851 --> 01:17:12,185
Maybe.

999
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,063
Do you like it?

1000
01:17:19,026 --> 01:17:20,818
I used to.

1001
01:17:22,362 --> 01:17:25,072
Now it's all strong-arm,
sitting-duck stuff.

1002
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:27,408
I mean, if I could...

1003
01:17:28,702 --> 01:17:31,204
If I could get a chance
to work Homicide...

1004
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,415
like a real detective...

1005
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:37,418
That prick Exley, he
shot the wrong guys.

1006
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:43,007
Whoever killed Stensland's still around.
I know it in here. I know it.

1007
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:45,384
There's something wrong
with the Nite Owl.

1008
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:47,887
I just can't prove
it, that's all.

1009
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:51,057
I'm not smart enough.

1010
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:56,229
I'm just the guy they bring in
to scare the other guy shitless.

1011
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,067
You're wrong.

1012
01:18:01,902 --> 01:18:04,445
You found Patchett.
You found me.

1013
01:18:04,822 --> 01:18:06,614
You're smart enough.

1014
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:21,879
Bud White. What brings you
down to the basement?

1015
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,176
I got a couple of
Nite Owl questions.

1016
01:18:27,344 --> 01:18:30,429
Don't know if you read the
papers, but that case is closed.

1017
01:18:32,432 --> 01:18:34,267
Anything bother you
about it, Ray?

1018
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:38,646
The fact that the pack-up boys haven't
hauled this shit out of here yet.

1019
01:18:43,443 --> 01:18:45,653
We got three shotguns taken
from the suspects...

1020
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:48,447
which match the strike marks
on the shell casings.

1021
01:18:48,615 --> 01:18:50,283
What more do you want?

1022
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,838
There's blood on the wall here.

1023
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,966
I thought everyone got
shot in the men's room.

1024
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:09,635
That is Stensland's blood.

1025
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,679
Stensland?

1026
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:15,600
Blow to the head. Probably unconscious
when they dragged him in the john.

1027
01:19:17,311 --> 01:19:18,561
Did they hit anyone else?

1028
01:19:18,729 --> 01:19:22,148
No, but he was a cop. He
probably tried to do something.

1029
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:29,614
Grilled cheese, black coffee.
Someone sitting next to him.

1030
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:35,328
Two of the victims were women?

1031
01:19:35,495 --> 01:19:39,624
Yeah, Patti DeLuca, the night shift
waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.

1032
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:46,005
Susan Lefferts.

1033
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:49,842
Yeah, what about her?

1034
01:19:52,304 --> 01:19:53,679
You're welcome.

1035
01:19:55,974 --> 01:19:58,059
Mrs. Lefferts.

1036
01:19:59,686 --> 01:20:03,648
Mrs. Lefferts? I'm
Officer White, L.A.P.D.

1037
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:09,362
Tell me about the boyfriend. The one
you mentioned at the coroner's office.

1038
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,948
I told you I didn't approve
of that boyfriend.

1039
01:20:12,532 --> 01:20:16,911
He was too old for you. And
you let him be fresh with me.

1040
01:20:18,705 --> 01:20:21,165
They came here one day
when I wasn't home.

1041
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:23,459
Mrs. Jensen next door said...

1042
01:20:23,627 --> 01:20:26,671
she thought she saw Susie's
boyfriend and another man...

1043
01:20:26,838 --> 01:20:29,215
and she heard a ruckus.

1044
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:33,928
- What was the boyfriend's name?
- We weren't properly introduced.

1045
01:20:34,554 --> 01:20:36,889
Susie gave him a nickname,
"Muns" or "Luns."

1046
01:20:37,057 --> 01:20:39,642
Stens? Was it Stens?

1047
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:44,397
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Look at a picture for me.

1048
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:49,735
That's him. That's him.

1049
01:20:55,117 --> 01:20:57,284
You said a neighbor
heard a ruckus.

1050
01:20:58,078 --> 01:21:00,121
Was it outside? Inside?

1051
01:21:01,415 --> 01:21:02,581
Outside.

1052
01:21:02,749 --> 01:21:06,836
And then Mrs. Jensen said they
kept going under the house.

1053
01:21:10,924 --> 01:21:13,259
You have to leave now, officer.

1054
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:17,930
- What's through here?
- Just a room full of old things.

1055
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,099
Don't move that.

1056
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:22,518
Phew.

1057
01:21:22,686 --> 01:21:26,147
Don't mind the smell. I think
a rat died behind the wall.

1058
01:21:27,441 --> 01:21:29,608
My Susie was a good girl.

1059
01:21:29,776 --> 01:21:32,778
She was never in any
kind of trouble at all.

1060
01:21:35,907 --> 01:21:36,949
Phew.

1061
01:22:44,017 --> 01:22:46,477
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.

1062
01:22:46,686 --> 01:22:48,229
They call me Buzz.

1063
01:22:55,445 --> 01:22:56,529
Was it a rat?

1064
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:59,240
Yeah, a great big one.

1065
01:23:01,701 --> 01:23:05,496
Here. Compliments of the Los
Angeles Police Department.

1066
01:23:22,722 --> 01:23:25,683
Stomach of the week
from a motel homicide.

1067
01:23:25,892 --> 01:23:29,311
Unemployed actor had frankfurter,
french fries, alcohol and sperm.

1068
01:23:29,479 --> 01:23:31,939
Hell of a last supper, don't
you think, lieutenant?

1069
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,733
Anything bothering you about
the, uh, Nite Owl case?

1070
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:37,570
Yeah, the fact that you guys
won't let it get filed away.

1071
01:23:38,738 --> 01:23:42,408
- What do you mean?
- Bud White grilled me on it this morning.

1072
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:47,413
- Bud White?
- You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.

1073
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:52,418
Did he say where he was going
after he talked to you?

1074
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,640
Let my daughter rest in peace.

1075
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:09,059
Mrs. Lefferts, I just wanna
ask a few questions.

1076
01:24:09,227 --> 01:24:11,604
Officer White already
checked under the house.

1077
01:24:12,189 --> 01:24:13,272
Under the house?

1078
01:24:14,024 --> 01:24:16,358
- Where?
- Out back.

1079
01:24:17,777 --> 01:24:19,445
All he found was rodents.

1080
01:24:22,782 --> 01:24:26,702
I need an ID on this as soon as possible.
You talk only to me on this one.

1081
01:24:29,789 --> 01:24:31,749
Vincennes, I need your
help with something.

1082
01:24:31,917 --> 01:24:35,961
I'm busy right now. Why don't you just
go ask some of your boys in Homicide?

1083
01:24:38,215 --> 01:24:40,883
I can't. I need someone
outside of Homicide.

1084
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:44,428
I want you to tail Bud White till
he goes on duty this evening.

1085
01:24:45,889 --> 01:24:48,140
Do me a real favor
and leave me alone.

1086
01:24:49,267 --> 01:24:51,602
Do you make the Negroes for
the Nite Owl killings?

1087
01:24:54,898 --> 01:24:57,483
- What?
- It's a simple question.

1088
01:24:59,569 --> 01:25:02,488
Why in the world do you wanna
go digging any deeper...

1089
01:25:02,656 --> 01:25:06,116
into the Nite Owl
killings, lieutenant?

1090
01:25:09,955 --> 01:25:11,664
Rollo Tomasi.

1091
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:16,502
Is there more to that, or
am I supposed to guess?

1092
01:25:18,588 --> 01:25:20,756
Rollo was a purse snatcher.

1093
01:25:25,178 --> 01:25:27,263
My father ran into
him off-duty...

1094
01:25:29,266 --> 01:25:32,351
and he shot my father six
times and got away clean.

1095
01:25:33,853 --> 01:25:35,604
No one even knew who he was.

1096
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:38,524
I made the name up to
give him personality.

1097
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,485
What's your point?

1098
01:25:42,112 --> 01:25:44,863
Rollo Tomasi's the
reason I became a cop.

1099
01:25:45,615 --> 01:25:49,159
I wanted to catch the guys who
thought they could get away with it.

1100
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:52,371
It was supposed to
be about justice.

1101
01:25:53,373 --> 01:25:56,375
Then somewhere along the
way, I lost sight of that.

1102
01:26:00,547 --> 01:26:01,797
Why'd you become a cop?

1103
01:26:07,554 --> 01:26:09,054
Huh.

1104
01:26:12,559 --> 01:26:14,601
I don't remember.

1105
01:26:20,817 --> 01:26:24,528
- What do you want, Exley?
- I just wanna solve this thing.

1106
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:28,407
- Nite Owl was solved.
- No.

1107
01:26:29,659 --> 01:26:30,993
I wanna do it right.

1108
01:26:31,661 --> 01:26:34,079
Even if it means paying
the consequences?

1109
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:35,664
Mm-hm.

1110
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,585
All right, college
boy, I'll help...

1111
01:26:39,753 --> 01:26:42,588
but there's a case your boys
in Homicide don't care about.

1112
01:26:42,756 --> 01:26:47,551
They think it's just another
Hollywood "homo-cide," but I don't.

1113
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:50,846
You help me with mine,
I'll help you with yours.

1114
01:26:51,264 --> 01:26:54,099
- Deal?
- Deal.

1115
01:27:26,591 --> 01:27:28,675
Johnny Stompanato.

1116
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:32,721
Officer Wendell White.
How's tricks, paisano?

1117
01:27:32,931 --> 01:27:34,598
I ain't your paisano.

1118
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,476
I ain't in the snitch
business anymore.

1119
01:27:37,644 --> 01:27:39,937
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?

1120
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,856
Works for Pierce Patchett.

1121
01:27:43,441 --> 01:27:44,608
Should I?

1122
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:48,904
You're muscle for hire.
Meeks is muscle for hire.

1123
01:27:49,114 --> 01:27:50,447
You tell me.

1124
01:27:51,491 --> 01:27:53,867
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember now.

1125
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:58,163
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop. Same
as you're gonna be someday.

1126
01:27:58,373 --> 01:27:59,832
And that's all you're gonna get.

1127
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,543
And you can keep your 20 bucks.

1128
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:11,468
What do I get if I give you your
balls back, you wop cocksucker?

1129
01:28:12,429 --> 01:28:15,639
Okay. Okay.

1130
01:28:15,807 --> 01:28:18,183
There was a rumor
going around...

1131
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:21,520
that Meeks had a line
on a large supply of H.

1132
01:28:23,565 --> 01:28:28,527
- And?
- And nothing. He skipped out.

1133
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,082
Bullshit.

1134
01:28:43,042 --> 01:28:46,211
How would Meeks get his hands
on a large supply of heroin?

1135
01:28:47,046 --> 01:28:50,382
You're right. It's
probably bullshit.

1136
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:53,093
Even if he did, he
could never unload it.

1137
01:28:53,386 --> 01:28:55,888
Not without drawing all
kinds of attention.

1138
01:28:56,431 --> 01:29:00,434
Maybe that's why he's under a house in
Elysian Park and he don't smell too good...

1139
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:03,270
paisano.

1140
01:29:55,698 --> 01:29:58,242
Maybe White's not
so dumb after all.

1141
01:30:11,464 --> 01:30:15,467
We got Rita Hayworth at the morgue,
and now Veronica Lake with White.

1142
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:20,347
I think your case and my case are
connected. It's Fleur-de-Lis again.

1143
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:21,682
Fleur-de-Lis?

1144
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:24,309
Yeah. "Whatever you desire."

1145
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:25,644
Porno.

1146
01:30:25,979 --> 01:30:28,814
High-class whores cut to
look like movie stars.

1147
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:32,651
Who knows what else. Reynolds, the
kid that got killed, was involved.

1148
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,486
So is Pierce Patchett.

1149
01:30:34,696 --> 01:30:35,988
The millionaire?

1150
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:38,490
Yeah, I think we
should go talk to him.

1151
01:30:39,325 --> 01:30:41,326
First I wanna brace Stompanato.

1152
01:30:57,594 --> 01:31:00,053
Want an autograph? Write to MGM.

1153
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:04,182
Since when do two-bit hoods and
hookers give out autographs?

1154
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:07,144
- What did you say to me?
- L.A.P.D. Sit down.

1155
01:31:07,353 --> 01:31:08,979
Who the hell do you
think you are?

1156
01:31:09,147 --> 01:31:11,857
Take a walk, honey, before
I haul your ass downtown.

1157
01:31:12,025 --> 01:31:14,818
- You are making a large mistake.
- Get away from our table.

1158
01:31:15,028 --> 01:31:16,361
Shut up.

1159
01:31:17,447 --> 01:31:19,781
A hooker cut to look like
Turner is still a hooker.

1160
01:31:19,949 --> 01:31:22,326
- Hey!
- She just looks like Lana Turner.

1161
01:31:22,493 --> 01:31:25,037
- She is Lana Turner.
- What?

1162
01:31:25,204 --> 01:31:27,289
She is Lana Turner.

1163
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:37,758
How was I supposed to know?

1164
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:57,903
I believe the Nite Owl's your
area of expertise, Mr. Exley.

1165
01:31:58,071 --> 01:32:00,614
I saw you on television
getting your medal.

1166
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:03,408
And you're...

1167
01:32:03,785 --> 01:32:07,621
that other Hollywood celebrity
policeman, aren't you?

1168
01:32:08,581 --> 01:32:12,584
The Veronica Lake look-alike works for you.
She's one of your whores, correct?

1169
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,089
- A vulgar term.
- Why's she seeing Bud White?

1170
01:32:17,256 --> 01:32:21,093
Why do men and women usually
see each other, Mr. Exley?

1171
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:26,682
Let's try this on for
size: Fleur-de-Lis.

1172
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:28,934
"Whatever you desire."

1173
01:32:29,602 --> 01:32:32,562
An actor named Matt Reynolds.

1174
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,566
No? Nothing?

1175
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:40,278
- No?
- We want some answers, Patchett.

1176
01:32:42,949 --> 01:32:44,825
We all want something.

1177
01:32:46,452 --> 01:32:49,121
- Lieutenant Exley, come in.
- Guy's as cool as they come.

1178
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:54,501
Lieutenant Exley, come in, please.
Over.

1179
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:56,712
This is Exley.

1180
01:32:56,879 --> 01:32:59,631
The coroner wants to talk to you.
He says he has your ID.

1181
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:02,759
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes
is coming in to talk to him.

1182
01:33:02,927 --> 01:33:04,803
- Roger.
- I'll drop you at your car.

1183
01:33:04,971 --> 01:33:07,180
- Where the hell are you going?
- Lynn Bracken's.

1184
01:33:07,473 --> 01:33:10,976
I'm gonna find out why Patchett
has her seeing Bud White.

1185
01:33:11,144 --> 01:33:12,811
See you at the Frolic Room.

1186
01:33:12,979 --> 01:33:16,231
Oh, great. You get the
girl, I get the coroner.

1187
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,244
Hush-Hush, off the
record and on the q.t.

1188
01:33:32,081 --> 01:33:35,584
Hey, I was just coming up to see you.
You get that ID?

1189
01:33:35,752 --> 01:33:40,172
Thank God for dental records. Stiff
used to be a cop. Leland Meeks.

1190
01:33:40,339 --> 01:33:41,506
Buzz Meeks?

1191
01:33:41,674 --> 01:33:42,841
- You knew him?
- Of him.

1192
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:46,636
He was around when I joined the force.
Bad rep. Thanks.

1193
01:33:46,804 --> 01:33:50,682
Hey. "Just the facts," Jack.
"Just the facts."

1194
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,145
Anything else, sergeant?

1195
01:33:55,354 --> 01:33:58,523
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39 -'41.
I need to see his arrest records.

1196
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:00,859
Okay.

1197
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:09,034
Miss Bracken, I'm
Lieutenant Exley.

1198
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:12,996
I know who you are. Bud
told me all about you.

1199
01:34:13,164 --> 01:34:15,040
Is that so?

1200
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:18,043
And what did White have to say?

1201
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,879
He said you were smart.

1202
01:34:21,547 --> 01:34:25,383
He also said you were a coward, and
that you'd screw yourself to get ahead.

1203
01:34:26,052 --> 01:34:28,553
Well, let's concentrate
on my smarts.

1204
01:34:28,721 --> 01:34:33,558
Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?
Taught you how to dress, talk and think.

1205
01:34:34,727 --> 01:34:36,561
I am very impressed
with the results...

1206
01:34:37,897 --> 01:34:39,356
but I need answers.

1207
01:34:39,524 --> 01:34:42,567
And if I don't get them, I'm gonna
take you and Patchett down.

1208
01:34:43,236 --> 01:34:45,904
Pierce Patchett can
take care of himself.

1209
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:48,907
And I'm not afraid of you.

1210
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:52,452
And you forget one
thing, lieutenant...

1211
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:55,413
Pierce also taught
me how to fuck.

1212
01:34:59,126 --> 01:35:03,421
And he tells you who to fuck. Why
does he have you fucking Bud White?

1213
01:35:03,631 --> 01:35:06,299
What makes you think I'm not
seeing Bud because I want to?

1214
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:11,805
It would be easier for you if
there was an angle, wouldn't it?

1215
01:35:12,598 --> 01:35:15,684
You're afraid of Bud because you
can't figure out how to play him.

1216
01:35:16,769 --> 01:35:19,980
He doesn't follow the same
rules of politics as you do.

1217
01:35:20,773 --> 01:35:22,566
It makes him dangerous.

1218
01:35:22,775 --> 01:35:25,443
- I can handle Bud White.
- Can you?

1219
01:35:29,448 --> 01:35:31,658
I see Bud because I want to.

1220
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:38,498
I see Bud because he can't
hide the good inside of him.

1221
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:43,086
I see Bud because he makes
me feel like Lynn Bracken...

1222
01:35:43,296 --> 01:35:46,673
and not some Veronica Lake
look-alike who fucks for money.

1223
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:53,138
I see Bud because he doesn't
know how to disguise who he is.

1224
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:58,810
I see Bud for all the ways
he's different from you.

1225
01:36:01,188 --> 01:36:03,481
Don't underestimate
me, Miss Bracken.

1226
01:36:03,816 --> 01:36:06,818
The way you've
underestimated Bud White?

1227
01:36:13,326 --> 01:36:15,994
Fucking me and fucking Bud
aren't the same thing, you know.

1228
01:36:16,495 --> 01:36:18,496
Stop talking about Bud White.

1229
01:36:43,397 --> 01:36:45,357
Come on.

1230
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:49,361
Shit.

1231
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:04,417
Jack Vincennes.

1232
01:37:05,419 --> 01:37:07,170
It's going on midnight, Jack.

1233
01:37:07,338 --> 01:37:09,255
I need two minutes, Dudley.

1234
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,799
It's important.

1235
01:37:11,425 --> 01:37:15,720
Good thing for you my wife and daughters
are at the beach in Santa Barbara.

1236
01:37:18,849 --> 01:37:24,020
- Do you remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
- A disgrace as a police officer.

1237
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:28,400
Straight D fitness reports from every CO
he ever served under. What about him?

1238
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:32,028
Twelve years ago, he was on a
Vice roust with Dick Stensland.

1239
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:35,532
They questioned Pierce Patchett
about a blackmail scam.

1240
01:37:35,741 --> 01:37:39,911
Patchett had Sid Hudgens photographing
prominent businessmen with hookers.

1241
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:43,581
Anyway, charges were dropped.
Insufficient evidence.

1242
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:45,917
You were the supervising
officer on that case.

1243
01:37:46,085 --> 01:37:48,336
I was wondering if you
remember anything about it.

1244
01:37:49,588 --> 01:37:51,089
What's this all about, boyo?

1245
01:37:52,049 --> 01:37:55,593
Part of it has to do with a murder.
I've been working with Ed Exley on it.

1246
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,596
You're Narco, Jack,
not Homicide.

1247
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:01,016
Since when do you work
with Edmund Exley?

1248
01:38:02,143 --> 01:38:04,602
It's a private investigation.

1249
01:38:05,104 --> 01:38:06,354
Ah.

1250
01:38:06,605 --> 01:38:09,107
I messed something up. I'm
trying to make amends.

1251
01:38:09,275 --> 01:38:11,651
Don't start trying to do
the right thing, boyo.

1252
01:38:12,153 --> 01:38:14,446
You haven't had the practice.

1253
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:25,248
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.
Hmm.

1254
01:38:26,792 --> 01:38:30,045
So, what does Exley
make of this?

1255
01:38:30,212 --> 01:38:33,298
I haven't told him yet. I just
came from the records room.

1256
01:38:58,991 --> 01:39:01,284
Have you a valediction, boyo?

1257
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:09,167
Rollo...

1258
01:39:10,211 --> 01:39:11,878
Tomasi.

1259
01:39:32,733 --> 01:39:36,319
Sergeant Vincennes was killed
by a .32 slug to the heart.

1260
01:39:36,529 --> 01:39:38,905
Time of death,
approximately 1 a.m.

1261
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:44,077
Although he was found in Echo Park,
forensics indicates the body was moved.

1262
01:39:45,704 --> 01:39:49,165
I want two-man teams to scour
that entire neighborhood.

1263
01:39:50,042 --> 01:39:54,254
Our justice must be
swift and merciless.

1264
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:57,465
That is all.

1265
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:08,893
Edmund, might I have
a word with you?

1266
01:40:12,398 --> 01:40:15,400
We're trying to run down a lead
on an associate of Vincennes.

1267
01:40:15,609 --> 01:40:18,444
The records check has
led to a dead end.

1268
01:40:18,737 --> 01:40:19,946
What's the name?

1269
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:21,990
Rollo Tomasi.

1270
01:40:23,742 --> 01:40:25,743
You ever heard
Vincennes mention him?

1271
01:40:28,581 --> 01:40:30,290
No. No, I haven't.

1272
01:40:33,794 --> 01:40:34,794
Well...

1273
01:40:34,962 --> 01:40:36,963
It's probably nothing. Still...

1274
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:40,800
keep your eyes open, eh, boyo?

1275
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:53,104
I know it's unlikely, but
suppose, just for a moment...

1276
01:40:53,314 --> 01:40:56,733
somebody did have that much heroin,
who would they go to to move it?

1277
01:40:57,276 --> 01:41:02,155
- White, in my office.
- Captain. Look, just give me a name.

1278
01:41:02,948 --> 01:41:04,324
Mickey Cohen.

1279
01:41:10,289 --> 01:41:11,289
Captain?

1280
01:41:11,457 --> 01:41:14,125
I could use your fearsome
habits at the Victory Motel.

1281
01:41:15,461 --> 01:41:16,711
Uh, when?

1282
01:41:17,963 --> 01:41:19,047
Now, Wendell.

1283
01:41:20,132 --> 01:41:21,341
Right.

1284
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:23,009
Close the door, lad.

1285
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:33,353
You're a bit of a puzzlement
to me these days, Wendell.

1286
01:41:33,729 --> 01:41:35,980
You don't seem to be your
old cruel self anymore.

1287
01:41:36,649 --> 01:41:39,609
And I had such grand
plans for your future.

1288
01:41:39,818 --> 01:41:41,027
What plans?

1289
01:41:42,488 --> 01:41:46,491
You have your extracurricular
activities and I have mine.

1290
01:41:49,536 --> 01:41:52,622
We must have a clarification
session one of these days.

1291
01:41:53,707 --> 01:41:56,834
However, right now...

1292
01:41:57,336 --> 01:42:00,546
we're gonna brace a man who may
know who killed Jack Vincennes.

1293
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:02,674
So the question is...

1294
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,509
can I count on you, lad?

1295
01:42:04,677 --> 01:42:06,594
- Yes or no?
- Yes, sir.

1296
01:42:11,684 --> 01:42:15,395
I wanna know everything you and Jack
Vincennes talked about last night.

1297
01:42:15,688 --> 01:42:17,689
Start with the ID on the corpse.

1298
01:42:17,898 --> 01:42:21,192
An ex-cop. Leland "Buzz" Meeks.

1299
01:42:21,402 --> 01:42:22,735
An ex-cop?

1300
01:42:23,195 --> 01:42:24,821
What did Jack say?
Did he know him?

1301
01:42:25,364 --> 01:42:27,448
Only by reputation.

1302
01:42:33,622 --> 01:42:35,832
Wendell, this is Sid Hudgens.

1303
01:42:36,041 --> 01:42:38,668
I'm willing to cooperate.
There's no need to tie me down.

1304
01:42:38,877 --> 01:42:40,586
It's for your own safety.

1305
01:42:41,588 --> 01:42:45,091
Now, what can you tell us about
Sergeant Jack Vincennes?

1306
01:42:45,259 --> 01:42:47,260
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?

1307
01:42:47,553 --> 01:42:50,513
I can tell you he's on the
night train to the big adiós.

1308
01:42:54,685 --> 01:42:58,271
I didn't have anything to do with him
getting killed, if that's what you mean.

1309
01:42:58,564 --> 01:43:02,483
- But you were business associates.
- What's that got to do with anything?

1310
01:43:03,736 --> 01:43:06,571
Okay, okay, so we
worked together.

1311
01:43:07,031 --> 01:43:09,073
It was an information exchange.

1312
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:11,784
I got him first-class collars,
he got me good stories.

1313
01:43:11,952 --> 01:43:13,745
We were friends, for chrissake.

1314
01:43:13,912 --> 01:43:15,413
We'll drop that for the moment.

1315
01:43:15,914 --> 01:43:17,749
Care to comment on
Pierce Patchett?

1316
01:43:17,916 --> 01:43:21,336
Patchett? You think he had something
to do with Vincennes getting iced?

1317
01:43:21,503 --> 01:43:26,549
Wendell, I'd like full and docile
cooperation on every topic.

1318
01:43:26,717 --> 01:43:29,218
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1319
01:43:30,763 --> 01:43:33,681
Everybody knows that Patchett's
worth a boatload of greenbacks.

1320
01:43:34,099 --> 01:43:35,975
But the man has hobbies too.

1321
01:43:36,185 --> 01:43:38,770
He bankrolls B-movies
under the table.

1322
01:43:39,188 --> 01:43:40,813
And try this one on:

1323
01:43:41,023 --> 01:43:43,274
He's rumored to be a
periodic heroin sniffer.

1324
01:43:43,442 --> 01:43:46,527
All in all, a powerful
behind-the-scenes strange-o.

1325
01:43:46,695 --> 01:43:48,696
- And?
- And what?

1326
01:43:52,785 --> 01:43:56,579
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens, is
the key to every relationship.

1327
01:43:59,708 --> 01:44:01,292
He runs call girls.

1328
01:44:03,212 --> 01:44:06,297
Primo tail fixed up to
look like movie stars.

1329
01:44:09,051 --> 01:44:11,803
- And?
- Blackmail shit.

1330
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:15,681
In my car, in the
trunk, under the rug...

1331
01:44:15,974 --> 01:44:20,269
Patchett got me to photograph this cop
screwing this gorgeous slut named Lynn.

1332
01:44:20,437 --> 01:44:22,563
Looks just like Veronica Lake.

1333
01:44:22,731 --> 01:44:26,818
Wendell. Wendell. Leave him be.
I said, leave him be.

1334
01:44:26,985 --> 01:44:30,571
- Get him off me. Get him away from me.
- Back off, Wendell. Back off.

1335
01:45:14,783 --> 01:45:19,704
I wouldn't trade places with Edmund Exley
right now for all the whiskey in Ireland.

1336
01:45:20,622 --> 01:45:21,664
Dudley.

1337
01:45:23,792 --> 01:45:27,253
Dudley, I thought you were gonna
let the dumb bastard kill me.

1338
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:30,590
And you, learn to pull your
punches a little better.

1339
01:45:30,799 --> 01:45:32,884
You can uncuff me now, fellas.

1340
01:45:38,515 --> 01:45:40,183
Fellas...

1341
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:42,685
Dudley, we had a deal.

1342
01:45:42,853 --> 01:45:44,520
You, me and Patchett,
we're a team.

1343
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,902
Hush-hush.

1344
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:54,071
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1345
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:57,074
Meeks never made an arrest the
entire time he worked Vice?

1346
01:45:57,242 --> 01:45:59,243
Someone must've
pulled the files.

1347
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:03,748
What about the daily
report books?

1348
01:46:03,916 --> 01:46:05,750
They'd be buried
in the basement.

1349
01:46:05,918 --> 01:46:07,168
Find them.

1350
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:39,742
Did you talk to Exley?

1351
01:46:40,244 --> 01:46:41,994
Come in out of the rain.

1352
01:46:43,997 --> 01:46:46,082
I wanna know what
happened with Exley.

1353
01:46:47,834 --> 01:46:49,168
Just come in.

1354
01:46:50,546 --> 01:46:53,130
Are you gonna tell me what
happened with you and Exley?

1355
01:46:53,757 --> 01:46:55,091
We talked.

1356
01:46:55,676 --> 01:46:57,760
- So tell me about him.
- Later.

1357
01:46:57,928 --> 01:47:00,888
No! Now.

1358
01:47:03,433 --> 01:47:10,106
You fucked him.

1359
01:47:10,857 --> 01:47:12,900
I thought I was helping you.

1360
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:06,203
Bud, I'm glad you're here.
I need you to see this.

1361
01:48:15,756 --> 01:48:16,797
Wait.

1362
01:48:43,617 --> 01:48:45,159
Dudley killed Jack.

1363
01:48:45,786 --> 01:48:47,620
He wants you to kill me.

1364
01:48:50,707 --> 01:48:52,708
He showed you the
photo, didn't he?

1365
01:48:53,543 --> 01:48:54,585
Didn't he?

1366
01:48:57,214 --> 01:49:00,675
Think. Goddamn you, think!

1367
01:49:01,927 --> 01:49:04,095
Get the fuck out of here.

1368
01:49:16,733 --> 01:49:18,109
Dudley.

1369
01:49:19,486 --> 01:49:21,654
I checked the daily
report books.

1370
01:49:22,823 --> 01:49:26,283
Dudley, Buzz Meeks and
Stensland go way back.

1371
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:31,747
I knew Stensland lied to me.

1372
01:49:34,751 --> 01:49:37,837
Lefferts' mother ID'd Stensland
as Lefferts' boyfriend.

1373
01:49:39,589 --> 01:49:44,176
Stensland pretended he didn't know
Meeks or her the night that I met...

1374
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:46,971
Lynn.

1375
01:49:47,597 --> 01:49:49,181
Stensland and Meeks...

1376
01:49:49,683 --> 01:49:51,350
what the hell were they up to?

1377
01:49:52,144 --> 01:49:55,563
I don't know, but I think Stens
killed Meeks over heroin.

1378
01:49:56,022 --> 01:49:57,148
What heroin?

1379
01:50:03,113 --> 01:50:06,699
Johnny Stompanato told me that
Meeks had heroin for sale.

1380
01:50:07,033 --> 01:50:08,701
Meeks ends up dead.

1381
01:50:09,202 --> 01:50:11,328
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.

1382
01:50:12,289 --> 01:50:14,039
It wasn't the Negroes.

1383
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:17,001
The rape victim lied
in her statement.

1384
01:50:17,544 --> 01:50:21,172
The first guys to the Mercury
coupe were Breuning and Carlisle.

1385
01:50:21,381 --> 01:50:22,882
Dudley's guys.

1386
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,092
They planted the shotguns.

1387
01:50:25,302 --> 01:50:28,637
And they'd have killed the Negroes,
too, if Jack and I hadn't shown up.

1388
01:50:29,639 --> 01:50:32,808
Dudley framed them because they
were Negroes and had records.

1389
01:50:33,143 --> 01:50:35,728
He knew there'd be no
questions asked...

1390
01:50:37,147 --> 01:50:39,523
if they were killed
resisting arrest.

1391
01:50:40,567 --> 01:50:42,943
Somehow this is all
connected to Jack's angle.

1392
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:45,404
Sid Hudgens...

1393
01:50:45,572 --> 01:50:47,740
the pictures to
blackmail Ellis Loew...

1394
01:50:48,825 --> 01:50:50,493
A kid got murdered.

1395
01:50:51,161 --> 01:50:54,205
If we're gonna figure this
out, we need to work together.

1396
01:50:59,085 --> 01:51:00,753
Why are you doing this?

1397
01:51:02,756 --> 01:51:04,590
The Nite Owl made you.

1398
01:51:06,426 --> 01:51:08,052
You wanna tear all that down?

1399
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:11,430
With a wrecking ball.

1400
01:51:11,932 --> 01:51:13,766
You wanna help me swing it?

1401
01:51:26,071 --> 01:51:28,072
Let's go see Ellis Loew.

1402
01:51:28,615 --> 01:51:31,367
Find out what the
district attorney knows.

1403
01:51:36,581 --> 01:51:37,832
May I...?

1404
01:51:37,999 --> 01:51:41,043
Hey. You can't go in there.

1405
01:51:43,296 --> 01:51:45,047
Want me to call the police, Mr.
Loew?

1406
01:51:45,215 --> 01:51:46,549
Ask for Captain Dudley Smith.

1407
01:51:46,716 --> 01:51:50,511
Tell him we're having a discussion about
the death of an actor at a motel.

1408
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:51,846
These are the police.

1409
01:51:58,562 --> 01:51:59,770
What do you want?

1410
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:04,275
I want DA bureau men to tail Dudley
Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.

1411
01:52:04,442 --> 01:52:07,945
I want you to get a judge to authorize
wiretaps on their home phones.

1412
01:52:08,154 --> 01:52:10,447
I want authorization to
check their bank records.

1413
01:52:10,991 --> 01:52:12,449
On what evidence?

1414
01:52:12,993 --> 01:52:14,660
Call it a hunch.

1415
01:52:15,912 --> 01:52:17,621
Absolutely not.

1416
01:52:17,831 --> 01:52:20,791
Dudley Smith is a highly decorated
member of this department.

1417
01:52:21,001 --> 01:52:23,210
I'm not gonna smear his
and Patchett's name...

1418
01:52:23,378 --> 01:52:24,628
Without what?

1419
01:52:25,005 --> 01:52:27,089
Them smearing yours first?

1420
01:52:27,257 --> 01:52:30,801
What do they have? Pictures of you and
Matt Reynolds with your pants down?

1421
01:52:33,179 --> 01:52:34,263
You have any proof?

1422
01:52:34,931 --> 01:52:36,640
The proof had his throat slit.

1423
01:52:38,018 --> 01:52:40,185
So far, you're not denying it.

1424
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:43,480
I'm not gonna dignify
this with answers.

1425
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:46,150
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me...

1426
01:52:46,359 --> 01:52:50,195
I have a press conference for Jack
Vincennes that I have to prepare for.

1427
01:53:00,874 --> 01:53:05,336
Unless you came in to wipe my
ass, I believe we're through.

1428
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:14,345
Don't pull that good-cop-bad-cop crap.
I practically invented it.

1429
01:53:14,512 --> 01:53:16,805
So what if some
homo actor is dead.

1430
01:53:16,973 --> 01:53:19,725
Boys, girls, 10 of them get off
the bus to L.A. every day.

1431
01:53:27,901 --> 01:53:31,445
- Pull him off me, Exley!
- I don't know how.

1432
01:53:34,324 --> 01:53:37,910
I know you think you're the A-number-one
hotshot, but here's the juice.

1433
01:53:38,078 --> 01:53:40,871
If I take you out, 10 lawyers
will take your place tomorrow.

1434
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:42,581
They just won't come on a bus.

1435
01:53:56,846 --> 01:53:58,764
All right! Okay!

1436
01:53:59,182 --> 01:54:03,435
Dudley and Patchett, they...
Oh, my God.

1437
01:54:03,895 --> 01:54:07,940
I wouldn't play ball, so they set me up. I
gave in, but the kid heard everything...

1438
01:54:09,776 --> 01:54:11,819
- so they killed him.
- Why?

1439
01:54:11,987 --> 01:54:15,406
- What are Dudley and Patchett up to?
- Taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets.

1440
01:54:15,865 --> 01:54:20,077
Because of those pictures,
I couldn't prosecute them.

1441
01:54:20,245 --> 01:54:22,454
Oh, Jesus. Help me up.

1442
01:54:31,756 --> 01:54:34,758
Is that how you used to
run the good-cop-bad-cop?

1443
01:54:36,553 --> 01:54:38,929
Patchett?

1444
01:55:13,214 --> 01:55:16,633
Looks like his bodyguard had
a conflict of interest.

1445
01:55:22,307 --> 01:55:23,640
Suicide note.

1446
01:55:23,808 --> 01:55:28,437
Says he killed Jack because Jack had
figured out a pornography scam.

1447
01:55:28,605 --> 01:55:30,397
Slicing himself open
wasn't his idea.

1448
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:35,903
- Two of his fingers are broken.
- They must have held him there.

1449
01:55:36,988 --> 01:55:38,906
Or drugged him.

1450
01:55:41,326 --> 01:55:43,827
I'd say Dudley's tying
up his loose ends.

1451
01:55:43,995 --> 01:55:47,081
Patchett's dead. He
sent you after me.

1452
01:55:48,833 --> 01:55:50,125
Lynn.

1453
01:55:51,044 --> 01:55:52,086
West Hollywood.

1454
01:55:52,253 --> 01:55:55,339
- They're closer than we are.
- I'll get the car. Keys.

1455
01:56:02,097 --> 01:56:05,516
Hey. We took her to the
station for safekeeping.

1456
01:56:06,518 --> 01:56:09,770
Hold her as Joan Smith. And no
one sees her unless I okay it.

1457
01:56:10,855 --> 01:56:14,858
Somebody worked her over.
She wouldn't say who.

1458
01:56:19,697 --> 01:56:21,031
- See you, Exley.
- Sure.

1459
01:56:24,452 --> 01:56:28,330
- We should talk to Lynn.
- You do it.

1460
01:56:28,581 --> 01:56:29,665
What are you gonna do?

1461
01:56:33,211 --> 01:56:35,671
I'm gonna talk to Sid Hudgens.

1462
01:56:35,839 --> 01:56:38,757
Compliment him on his performance
at the Victory Motel.

1463
01:56:38,925 --> 01:56:43,303
- Remember, Bud, we need evidence.
- I'll get the evidence.

1464
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:58,193
Are you okay?

1465
01:56:59,904 --> 01:57:01,905
You okay?

1466
01:57:11,583 --> 01:57:13,250
Bud hates himself
for what he did.

1467
01:57:14,794 --> 01:57:16,545
I know how he feels.

1468
01:57:19,215 --> 01:57:21,717
I need to know what you can
give me on Dudley Smith.

1469
01:57:24,095 --> 01:57:27,097
He's a police captain. He's
in business with Patchett.

1470
01:57:27,265 --> 01:57:28,557
I've never heard of him.

1471
01:57:33,062 --> 01:57:35,522
Do you have someplace
you can stay?

1472
01:57:36,274 --> 01:57:38,192
I'll be okay.

1473
01:57:44,490 --> 01:57:47,117
Nobody goes in
without official ID.

1474
01:57:51,456 --> 01:57:53,707
He's okay. Let him through.

1475
01:57:56,836 --> 01:57:58,545
What happened?

1476
01:57:58,713 --> 01:58:01,590
Somebody beat him to death
and stole a bunch of files.

1477
01:58:01,758 --> 01:58:04,134
Must have dug up garbage
on the wrong guy.

1478
01:58:04,302 --> 01:58:07,137
We got it narrowed down
to 1,000 suspects.

1479
01:58:07,305 --> 01:58:09,640
Sergeant White...

1480
01:58:09,807 --> 01:58:11,308
Dispatch got a call for you.

1481
01:58:11,476 --> 01:58:14,978
Lieutenant Exley wants you to
meet him at the Victory Motel.

1482
01:58:48,596 --> 01:58:50,681
You wanted to meet here?

1483
01:58:52,267 --> 01:58:55,894
- You called it. I thought Hudgens was...
- Hudgens is dead.

1484
01:59:06,823 --> 01:59:08,824
Let's get out of here.

1485
01:59:15,748 --> 01:59:17,457
It's too late.

1486
02:00:06,674 --> 02:00:09,092
You figured this was a setup
and showed up anyway?

1487
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:11,428
A lot of bad stuff
happened here.

1488
02:00:11,596 --> 02:00:14,514
It's as good a place
as any for it to end.

1489
02:00:23,691 --> 02:00:25,484
Here. Clip.

1490
02:00:30,156 --> 02:00:33,700
All I ever wanted was to
measure up to my father.

1491
02:00:34,118 --> 02:00:35,911
Now's your chance.

1492
02:00:37,705 --> 02:00:40,332
He died in the line
of duty, didn't he?

1493
02:01:39,517 --> 02:01:40,642
Bud.

1494
02:02:38,826 --> 02:02:40,285
Goddamn it!

1495
02:03:40,596 --> 02:03:43,807
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1496
02:04:01,993 --> 02:04:03,910
Come on. Easy. Come on.

1497
02:04:10,751 --> 02:04:12,335
Move!

1498
02:04:34,275 --> 02:04:35,442
Rollo Tomasi.

1499
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:42,198
- Who is he?
- You are.

1500
02:04:44,827 --> 02:04:47,370
You're the guy who
gets away with it.

1501
02:04:50,666 --> 02:04:53,126
Jack knew it and so do I.

1502
02:05:19,236 --> 02:05:24,115
Are you gonna shoot
me or arrest me?

1503
02:05:29,455 --> 02:05:30,497
Good lad.

1504
02:05:31,582 --> 02:05:33,249
Always the politician.

1505
02:05:34,168 --> 02:05:36,419
Let me do the talking.

1506
02:05:36,587 --> 02:05:40,548
After I'm done, they'll make
you chief of detectives.

1507
02:06:07,493 --> 02:06:11,996
Hold up your badge so they'll
know you're a policeman.

1508
02:07:02,006 --> 02:07:05,300
You think you can talk your
way out of this, lieutenant?

1509
02:07:07,428 --> 02:07:08,720
No...

1510
02:07:08,888 --> 02:07:11,222
but I think I can
tell the truth.

1511
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:13,975
During our investigation...

1512
02:07:14,393 --> 02:07:18,021
of events surrounding
the Nite Owl case...

1513
02:07:18,647 --> 02:07:21,775
Jack Vincennes, Bud White and
I learned the following.

1514
02:07:22,777 --> 02:07:25,236
Your golden boy's throwing
his whole life away.

1515
02:07:25,404 --> 02:07:27,822
The three Nite Owl suspects...

1516
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:30,950
while guilty of
kidnapping and rape...

1517
02:07:31,243 --> 02:07:34,746
were innocent of the multiple
homicides at the Nite Owl.

1518
02:07:35,539 --> 02:07:37,499
The actual gunmen
were most likely...

1519
02:07:37,666 --> 02:07:42,545
Los Angeles Police Department officers
Michael Breuning and William Carlisle...

1520
02:07:42,713 --> 02:07:44,714
and a third man...

1521
02:07:44,965 --> 02:07:48,885
who may or may not have
been Captain Dudley Smith.

1522
02:07:49,637 --> 02:07:51,387
The objective:

1523
02:07:52,097 --> 02:07:54,641
The elimination of another
police officer...

1524
02:07:54,809 --> 02:07:57,060
Richard Stensland...

1525
02:07:57,645 --> 02:08:03,566
who, along with former L.A.P.D.
Officer Leland "Buzz" Meeks...

1526
02:08:03,734 --> 02:08:07,904
also committed multiple homicides
on behalf of Captain Smith...

1527
02:08:08,072 --> 02:08:11,908
and then betrayed him over
25 pounds of heroin...

1528
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:15,245
the retrieval of which...

1529
02:08:15,412 --> 02:08:18,915
was the ultimate motivation
behind the Nite Owl killings.

1530
02:08:21,627 --> 02:08:25,255
Beginning with the incarceration
of Mickey Cohen...

1531
02:08:25,422 --> 02:08:30,885
Captain Smith has been assuming control
of organized crime in Los Angeles.

1532
02:08:31,053 --> 02:08:32,762
This includes the
assassinations...

1533
02:08:32,930 --> 02:08:35,598
of an unknown number of
Mickey Cohen lieutenants...

1534
02:08:36,559 --> 02:08:40,019
the systematic blackmail
of city officials...

1535
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:46,109
and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens...

1536
02:08:47,111 --> 02:08:49,737
and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.

1537
02:08:52,449 --> 02:08:55,118
Captain Smith admitted
as much to me...

1538
02:08:55,911 --> 02:09:00,373
before I shot him at
the Victory Motel.

1539
02:09:02,251 --> 02:09:04,085
That's it.

1540
02:09:05,796 --> 02:09:07,839
Well...

1541
02:09:08,257 --> 02:09:10,091
the press is gonna
have a field day.

1542
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:15,930
This... Christ, it'll stain
the department for years.

1543
02:09:16,098 --> 02:09:17,974
Decades.

1544
02:09:18,475 --> 02:09:21,394
If we can get the
kid to play ball...

1545
02:09:22,104 --> 02:09:24,272
who's to say what happened?

1546
02:09:24,982 --> 02:09:27,483
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.

1547
02:09:27,651 --> 02:09:29,986
- Good idea.
- If we get the press to play.

1548
02:09:37,953 --> 02:09:41,414
You wanna tell me what
you're smiling about?

1549
02:09:46,295 --> 02:09:47,420
A hero.

1550
02:09:48,172 --> 02:09:50,173
How'd he know what
we're talking about?

1551
02:09:50,341 --> 02:09:52,258
He couldn't have heard us.

1552
02:09:54,303 --> 02:09:55,345
And?

1553
02:09:55,512 --> 02:09:57,680
In this situation...

1554
02:09:57,848 --> 02:10:00,183
you'll need more than one.

1555
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:09,525
It is with great pleasure
that I present this award...

1556
02:10:09,693 --> 02:10:11,611
to Detective Lieutenant
Edmund Exley...

1557
02:10:12,196 --> 02:10:15,406
two-time Medal of
Valor recipient.

1558
02:10:24,291 --> 02:10:28,544
Next year, the L.A.P.D. will
move into its new facility.

1559
02:10:28,712 --> 02:10:30,463
With leaders like
Edmund Exley...

1560
02:10:30,631 --> 02:10:33,967
the image of fat cops stealing
apples will be left behind...

1561
02:10:34,134 --> 02:10:37,637
and Los Angeles will finally have
the police force it deserves.

1562
02:10:51,819 --> 02:10:53,736
You just couldn't resist.

1563
02:10:54,196 --> 02:10:56,489
They're using me, so for
a while, I'm using them.

1564
02:10:58,742 --> 02:11:00,118
Come on.

1565
02:11:19,013 --> 02:11:20,680
Hey.

1566
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:37,030
Thanks for the push.

1567
02:11:46,623 --> 02:11:48,082
Yeah.

1568
02:11:57,593 --> 02:12:00,303
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Exley.

1569
02:12:03,265 --> 02:12:05,600
Some men get the world...

1570
02:12:05,768 --> 02:12:09,145
others get ex-hookers
and a trip to Arizona.

1571
02:12:21,033 --> 02:12:24,827
- Bye.
- Bye.
