00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,927
Six years ago...

11
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,486
on the morning of May 20, 1927...

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,047
I was fast asleep when my
bedside phone began to ring.

13
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,806
I looked at my alarm clock.
It was almost 5:00.

14
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,685
I knew there was only one
person in the whole world...

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,729
who would call at such an hour.

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,923
And when I picked up the phone,
I knew I was right.

17
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,362
'Hello, ' I said. There was
quite a bit of noise on the line.

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,767
'Aaron, Charles Lindbergh here.
Sorry about the noise.

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,521
I'm calling from Roosevelt Field,
and we're doing engine tests.'

20
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,650
'That's okay, Slim', I said.
'What can I do for you?'

21
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,545
'Well', he said,

22
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:39,710
'remember that flight across the
Atlantic I was telling you about?'

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,441
I told him I remembered.
He'd been telling me about it...

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,882
for months and made me
swear to keep it a secret.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,083
'Here's the situation', Slim said.
'The fact is I'll be shoving off...

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,290
in a few hours... around 10 to 8:00...
and I wanted to ask you about food.'

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,529
'Food?' I said.
'Yes', he replied.

28
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,361
'I anticipate the flight
to take about 34 hours...

29
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,768
and I wanted your opinion
on what kind of food to bring.'

30
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,685
'Well', I said, 'you can't go
wrong with a cheese sandwich.

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,763
And don't forget the mustard.'

32
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,762
He laughed.

33
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,646
'I knew I could count on you, Aaron.
I'll cable you from Paris.'

34
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,240
'Good luck', I told him
and hung up the phone.

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,931
Like everyone else,
I listened to the radio...

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,082
for news about his flight...

37
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,568
but I wasn't worried about his
safety because I knew he had...

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,287
a special collapsible lifeboat behind
his pilot seat in case of emergency.

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,880
But when the Spirit of St. Louis
landed in Paris...

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,924
33 1/2 hours after takeoff...

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,283
I yelled so loud the windows shook.

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,767
Two days later I received
a telegram.

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,123
It said, 'Sorry to
disturb your sleep...

44
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,760
but alas, 'twas good
to hear your voice.

45
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,127
Take it from
your good friend Chaz...

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,164
the cheese I chewed was choice."'

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,647
The end.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,322
Thank you, Aaron.

49
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,966
That was... very inventive.

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,801
My mother was the maid of honor
at Charles Lindbergh's wedding.

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,281
Really?

52
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,609
Our last report for the day
will be read by Billy Thompson.

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,805
The American hero he's chosen
is John D. Rockefeller.

54
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,648
"I chose John D. Rockefeller
as my American hero...

55
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,890
because, although he's one
of the richest men in the world...

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,083
he has never forgotten
his humble beginnings.

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,170
That's why he gives
generously to charity...

58
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,170
and hands out dimes
to the poor unfortunates...

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,931
he encounters on the streets."

60
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,811
- Hello, Aaron.
- Hi, Mr. Sandoz.

61
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,202
Sullivan!

62
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,322
Every day it's something.

63
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,962
No wonder you got caught.

64
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,208
Taking a kid's dessert!

65
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,642
I told you a thousand times,
only take food from the fat kids...

66
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,962
and you never take a kid's dessert.

67
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,806
A kid will leave his whole lunch
untouched and just eat the dessert.

68
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,327
- I know.
- Did you get sent to Mr. Stillwater?

69
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,033
Yeah.

70
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:00,270
You didn't tell him
where we live, did you?

71
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,321
No. He had his hands clamped onto the back
of my neck like a vulture or something.

72
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,847
- I couldn't talk.
- Good.

73
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,601
Come on, come on!

74
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,802
Hey, look.

75
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,567
- Big Butt Burns.
- Hurry up! Get out of the street.

76
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
Hey, hold it there.

77
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,965
You, come on! Let's go!
Move it along!

78
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,890
Hey, lady, get out of the street.

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,686
Come on, buddy. Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,008
When you gonna teach me marbles?

81
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,602
I keep telling ya:
All the important stuff can't be taught.

82
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,530
You just have to learn.
Who knows all the important stuff?

83
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,246
- Dad.
- Lester. And who taught him? Nobody.

84
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,648
- But I wanna be as good as you.
- Look.

85
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,044
Pick two.

86
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,490
Not that one.

87
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,250
No, not that one.

88
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,810
Definitely not that one.

89
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,127
Well, which ones can I have?

90
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,688
Here.

91
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,201
- Start practicing.
- But you kept the good ones.

92
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,448
- Want me to take 'em back?
- No.

93
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,045
Stop complaining.

94
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,924
Come on.

95
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,921
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,291
Took your father up a while ago.
He was readin' some letter.

97
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,289
Was it from a company?

98
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,882
He's expecting a letter from a watch
company. There's big money in watches.

99
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,771
Now, how would I know
who it was from?

100
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,691
Well, was it typed
or was it written by hand?

101
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,489
- By hand.
- It's probably nothing, then.

102
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,690
- Hey, stop!
- Let me get a few things...

103
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,953
You're
stepping on a black one.

104
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:39,829
Shh. Listen.

105
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,928
- What?
- Come on.

106
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,965
I just want my paints.
Just the watercolors and a few brushes.

107
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,120
I gotta do
what Mr. Desot tells me.

108
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:49,905
But...

109
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,329
How am I supposed
to earn money to pay my rent...

110
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,727
if I can't use my supplies?

111
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,811
- That's a puzzle, all right.
- So what would your price be...

112
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,884
to let me have five seconds
in that room?

113
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,002
A lot more than you got.

114
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,363
Ow! Aah!

115
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,364
Mom, we just...

116
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,127
Did somebody die?

117
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,049
Nobody died.

118
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,486
Well, what is it, then?

119
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,481
Your mother and I
have made a decision.

120
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,247
- You made the decision.
- You agreed to this!

121
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,408
I agreed we didn't have a choice.

122
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,602
That's not the same thing.

123
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,524
Tell them, Eric.

124
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,801
Sullivan will be
going away for a while.

125
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,847
What?

126
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,088
Uncle Nathan sent a letter
saying he'd keep him...

127
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,851
until we can get back
on our feet again.

128
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,526
That way we save
at least a dollar a week.

129
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,041
I could make a dollar
in a week, Dad.

130
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,051
Oh, you can make that much, huh?
He's finishing eighth grade.

131
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,208
- He's already the breadwinner!
- Eric.

132
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,890
He's too young!

133
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,968
You could send me.

134
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,321
We're sending him,
and that's final!

135
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,445
And what was the big idea of bursting
in here like the hotel was on fire?

136
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,762
That's no way to enter a room, sir!

137
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,566
We saw Sandoz
get locked out of his room.

138
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,443
On the third floor?

139
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,519
You said it could never
happen on the third floor.

140
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,245
I carry a lot of influence with Desot.
Don't you worry.

141
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,727
How do you think I got us
a room with a double exposure?

142
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,081
Triple, if you count the transom.

143
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,761
He knows Sid Gutman is going
to give me the Hamilton Watch line.

144
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,486
He knows I've got
this WPA job coming.

145
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,648
When that happens...

146
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,009
I call up my pal Donald Miller...

147
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,523
and we move to the Carleton Court
Apartments, where we belong.

148
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,046
Can I take Skippy?

149
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,650
"Can I take...?"
No, you can't take Skippy on the bus.

150
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,531
He's going on the bus?
Why aren't you driving him?

151
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,167
How can I drive him
when the Repleviners are waiting...

152
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,521
to take my car
any minute they see it?

153
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,610
And where would I get
the money to pay for gas?

154
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,291
I can't even afford to get
your mother's tooth fixed.

155
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,529
He's perfectly safe on the bus.
He's a big boy, aren't you?

156
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,405
Huh? You see?

157
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,164
- Hold on.
- Where are you going?

158
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,527
I have to leave a note for Lester.

159
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,561
Is there a law
against knocking on his door?

160
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,967
- He said it disturbs his mother.
- Is she sick?

161
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,651
- I've never seen her.
- Of course she's sick.

162
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,209
She's got back trouble from bending over to
pick up secret messages all day. Come on.

163
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,481
...irritated nasal membranes...

164
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,444
and helps to shrink puffy,
cold-swollen nasal passages...

165
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,211
...giving you more room to breathe.

166
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,649
Be a good boy.

167
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,649
Sullivan, see you soon,
big boy, huh?

168
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,205
Come on, Sull.

169
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,848
I don't wanna go!

170
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,010
Don't worry, okay? I'm gonna earn
some money and get you back.

171
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,408
- How?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

172
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,091
But I know Lester'll have
some ideas.

173
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,722
And don't worry about Skippy either.
I'll take good care of him.

174
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,248
See ya.

175
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,448
All right, try me again.

176
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,842
True or false?

177
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,931
Walter Eamons had to go to the hospital
because he played with his belly button...

178
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,725
so much it got infected,
and they had to operate.

179
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:09,956
Definitely false.

180
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,601
It's true. He's gonna be
out of school for three weeks.

181
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,124
All right, one more.

182
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,124
True or false?

183
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,687
Today after school...

184
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,770
I snuck into Sportsman's Park
through the left-field bleachers.

185
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,645
I passed by the railing
to go to the bathroom...

186
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,007
and saw Pepper Martin
going out to third.

187
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,886
He saw me and threw me
a piece of Wrigley's gum.

188
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,123
- True.
- False.

189
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,481
Gotcha.

190
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,081
Well, the trouble
with this game is...

191
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,010
I have to accept your word
for what's true or false.

192
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,486
- That's true.
- Hmm.

193
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,364
Night.

194
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,884
You said you were gonna play,
and you're gonna play,

195
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,725
- You ain't leavin' until you do.
- But it's not fair.

196
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,042
Put your marbles
on the ground or else.

197
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,130
- I ain't got time to argue with you!
- You okay, Billy?

198
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,930
Scram, small-fry.

199
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,249
This little sissy said he'd shoot
for ten marbles. Now he's welshin'.

200
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,563
- But their marbles are clearly inferior.
- So's your old man.

201
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,729
I'll tell you what. We'll shoot
partners, us against you.

202
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,168
I'll put up five and Billy
will put up five against your ten.

203
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,083
- Sure.
- You bet.

204
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,482
All right.
One, two, three, drop.

205
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,131
We'll let you go first.

206
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,403
- Go ahead and shoot first, Billy.
- Okay.

207
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,127
- Damn!
- How could you miss that?

208
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,409
Excuse me.

209
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,961
Pow!

210
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,442
Pow!

211
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,888
Pow!

212
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,970
Pow!

213
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,361
Wow!

214
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,482
Well, gentlemen, the game is over.

215
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,602
You were lucky.

216
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,446
- Sore losers.
- Yeah.

217
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,166
I never played marbles
before I came to Dewey.

218
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,924
No kidding.

219
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,850
Wanna come over
for a soda or something?

220
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,724
Yeah.

221
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,842
Look, Billy.
There's that salesman...

222
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,201
- I was telling you about.
- Oh, yes.

223
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,322
I don't understand.

224
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,000
Who would buy a candle
you can't even light?

225
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,448
I was just gonna change into
some playclothes, if you don't mind.

226
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,364
Sure.

227
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,282
Criminy!

228
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,200
- This is signed by Pepper Martin?
- Yes. My father got it for me.

229
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,126
I've never really used it, but maybe
it will be worth money someday.

230
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,886
Your father must be really nice.

231
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,765
Listen, Aaron,
how are you about birds?

232
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,850
I'm in favor of 'em.
I have a canary at home.

233
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,406
You have a canary?
Me too!

234
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,608
How many birds
did you say you have?

235
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,081
Well, you know,
right now, just the one.

236
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,846
But he'll take
a grape from my lips...

237
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,770
and fly to my finger
right when I put it out.

238
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,043
- That's nifty.
- Yeah. Why do you have so many?

239
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,288
I breed them. It's my hobby.

240
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,802
I sell them to Mr. Farley
at the shop on DeBaliviere.

241
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:12,948
You sell 'em?

242
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,770
- How much do you get?
- About three dollars a bird.

243
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,490
Gosh!

244
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,400
Hey, why don't you go into business?
I'll arrange it with Mr. Farley.

245
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,808
- Yeah, but I only have Skippy.
- I'll give you a female.

246
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,043
Females aren't worth anything
because they don't sing.

247
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,243
Really?
That... That's all I need?

248
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,604
Well, you need a breeding cage like
this one, but any big cage will do.

249
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,240
And then you need
a few odds and ends.

250
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,170
Here, this is put out by
the Miss Finch Birdseed Company.

251
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,601
It tells you everything.

252
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,847
Here's a pretty sexy-lookin' dish.

253
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,604
Hey.

254
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,004
Are you sure
you can't stay for dinner?

255
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,044
Um... no, ma'am.

256
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,642
My mother's hosting a mah-jongg
tournament, and she wanted me to be there.

257
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,001
You're hosting
a tournament in your house?

258
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,650
Well...

259
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,889
no, you see, we're living in a hotel until
our new house is finished being built.

260
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,002
The tournament is in the ballroom.

261
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,162
What kind of house
are you building?

262
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,409
Just a regular house like this one.

263
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,286
And what does
your father do, Aaron?

264
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,524
He flies airplanes.

265
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,689
- Wow!
- My, that's interesting.

266
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,127
So that's how you know
Charles Lindbergh.

267
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,649
Right.

268
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,526
So... what kind
of flying does he do?

269
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,847
Uh...

270
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,531
Well, it's sort of
for the government...

271
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,041
and I'm not supposed to discuss it.

272
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,162
Can't you tell us anything?

273
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,887
Billy, you heard what Aaron said.
It's supposed to be secret.

274
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,721
I'm sure he prefer we didn't
breathe a word of it to anyone.

275
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,524
Isn't that right, Aaron?

276
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,564
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,923
I know you took it.
I seen ya. Hand it over!

278
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:22,513
I don't have no apples!

279
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,967
I know you took it!
Now gimme that apple!

280
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,043
Give it here!
Give it here!

281
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,128
- You ain't got no apple, huh?
- No!

282
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,481
Let me tell you something.
This is my street.

283
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,126
This is my corner.
I know everything that goes on.

284
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,481
I catch you kiping apples
one more time...

285
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,491
I'm gonna run your little chicken ass in!
Now get out of here! Beat it!

286
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,687
Slow down!

287
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,606
What you got in there?

288
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,802
A canary.

289
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,730
- Thought you already had a canary.
- Yeah, I do.

290
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,047
A male one.
This is a female.

291
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,004
I'm gonna breed canaries.
There's big money in canaries.

292
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,725
Uh-huh.

293
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,811
I don't know where
you get all that vitality.

294
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,446
- Hi.
- Hi, Ella.

295
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,291
- What have you got?
- A canary.

296
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,880
I thought you already
had a canary.

297
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,731
I do, but this one's a female.
I'm gonna breed canaries.

298
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,121
We had a canary once.

299
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,329
Canaries are kinda nervous,
don't you think?

300
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,728
I think I'd rather have a cat.

301
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,729
I'd name her Stephanie.

302
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,845
- What are you gonna name your bird?
- I have to... go put her in her cage.

303
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,646
Oh, okay.
Uh, see you later?

304
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,962
Yeah, okay. Sure.

305
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,850
- Hi.
- Hello.

306
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,487
- What have you got there?
- Billy Thompson gave me a canary.

307
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,201
- Aaron, we already have a canary.
- I know we already have a canary.

308
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,129
This is a female.

309
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,086
Mr. Farley at the pet store said he'd
give three dollars apiece for babies.

310
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,168
My goodness... three dollars.
Are you sure?

311
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,487
Yep. And Billy said...

312
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,007
the average female
lays about four eggs...

313
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,686
so that's $12.

314
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,802
We can bring Sullivan home.

315
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,366
That would be wonderful.

316
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,041
- Where's Dad?
- Out selling candles.

317
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,672
Nobody's gonna buy those candles.
You can't even light 'em.

318
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,348
Why can't he sell something useful?

319
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,647
He's doing the best he can.

320
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,008
- Lester was here?
- I suppose so.

321
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,122
It was slipped under the door.

322
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,562
<i>♪ Missing the thrills
of nights that we've known ♪</i>

323
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,084
<i>♪ Can't we talk it over
before it's over ♪</i>

324
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,885
<i>- ♪ Before you whisper good-bye forever♪</i>
- Hey.

325
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,951
Must you wear that
filthy thing on your head?

326
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,362
Ma, it's a hat.

327
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,727
You wear it on your head.

328
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,968
What the hell are you doin'?

329
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,610
You know anything about golf, eh?

330
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,410
Not really.

331
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,884
Shit.

332
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,129
Sullivan got sent away
to live with my uncle.

333
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,925
At least you got
a brother to get sent.

334
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,961
Doesn't it cost
a lot of money to play?

335
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,765
You're not gonna play, brain.
You're gonna caddy.

336
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,922
I'm in good with the caddy master.

337
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,328
Thing is, first couple of times,
you gotta split your fee with him.

338
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,411
- It's still 50 cents to get you started.
- I could use 50 cents.

339
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,000
Yep, you and all of Missouri.

340
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,727
- You know any of the clubs?
- Uh, I know the putter.

341
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,962
Stupendous.
All right, it's easy.

342
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,607
You got your woods, driver,
brassie, spoon, cleek.

343
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,441
And you got your irons: one iron,
mid-iron, mid-mashie, mashie iron...

344
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,326
spade mashie, mashie niblick pitching
niblick, and regular niblick.

345
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,808
Give him whatever he asks for.
I'll make sure you go with me.

346
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,809
You won't have any trouble.

347
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,122
- I gotta go.
- Where you going?

348
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,726
I gotta go put these back
before Ben finds out.

349
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,002
How'd you get 'em
out of the storeroom?

350
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,849
Aaron, can I speak to you
outside for a minute?

351
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,365
Sure.

352
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,006
Aaron, it's been brought
to my attention...

353
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,841
that the address we have for you
in our records is no longer current.

354
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,008
Yes, that's because we moved.

355
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,006
Well, um, when you move,
you need to let the school know...

356
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,283
because we might need
to get in touch with your parents.

357
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,687
Also, if you've moved
out of the district...

358
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,968
you might be going
to the wrong school.

359
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,727
It is possible you should be going
to Clark instead of Dewey.

360
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,322
I know, but we're still
in the same district, I'm sure.

361
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,364
Well, can you tell me
where you're living now?

362
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,444
Yeah. The Carleton Court
Apartments...

363
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,723
4519 Riley Street.

364
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,002
But if you're gonna send
something there...

365
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,600
make sure to address it
to Donald Miller.

366
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,690
- Donald Miller?
- Yeah. Um...

367
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,291
my father works for the government,
and sometimes his mail gets stolen.

368
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,205
We think it might be foreign spies,
but we're not sure.

369
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,562
So if you put
Donald Miller's name...

370
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,206
whoever's taking the mail
will let it go through...

371
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,846
because they won't know
it's really for my father.

372
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,608
I see.

373
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,768
- For Donald Miller?
- Yeah.

374
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,450
I know it sounds complicated...

375
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,643
but it's the only way
to make sure my father'll get it.

376
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,611
I understand. Thank you.

377
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,444
You're welcome.

378
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,926
Flor Fina!

379
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,050
So the little bohunk's
snipin' butts again!

380
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,204
That's why you're such a runt...
you're snipin' butts all the time.

381
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,368
It's not a butt.
It's a cigar band.

382
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,010
You're a lyin' little thief, just
like that Yid what's-his-name!

383
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:43,668
Lester.

384
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,524
- Last name!
- Silverstone!

385
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,449
Silverstone.

386
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,284
So, uh... where's your old man?

387
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,411
Did he take a steamer
back to Krautland?

388
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,731
No, he's still here.

389
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,128
I ain't seen him drivin' around lately.
Did they snatch his car?

390
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,730
No.

391
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,411
Where's he keepin' it?
In a back lot?

392
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,483
He's gotta be hiding it somewhere.

393
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,001
I don't know. I guess so.

394
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,771
You guess so?

395
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,450
Come here.

396
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,325
You better watch yourself.

397
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,284
Black square.

398
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,569
Hey!

399
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,206
Yeah, you.

400
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,322
Come here.

401
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,283
You want a job?

402
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,051
Go give this to three-one-zero.

403
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,606
That's 310, you hear?

404
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,246
What do I get?

405
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,326
You get on my good side.

406
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,923
- Ah, Aaron.
- Hey, Mr. Mungo.

407
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,682
I see Brother Ben
has drafted you into service.

408
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,961
Yes, sir.

409
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,247
You like this cane?

410
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,010
Yeah, it's really superb.

411
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,451
Made from the leg bone of a rhinoceros.
Cost me a hundred dollars.

412
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,131
- A hundred dollars?
- Years ago...

413
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,643
when people like me were using
currency to light their cigars.

414
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,529
Speaking of which...

415
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,166
how's your cigar band
collection coming?

416
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,169
Pretty good.

417
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,842
I'll keep an eye out for you.

418
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,008
Thanks.

419
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,646
- Good-bye, Aaron.
- Good-bye.

420
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,771
Ah, here he is.

421
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,484
Hi.

422
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,967
- What's wrong?
- Well, your mother has...

423
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,168
Eric.

424
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,730
A...

425
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,971
the specialist said
I have to go back...

426
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,082
to the sanitarium for a while.

427
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,446
But he was very optimistic.

428
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,450
He said I might only
have to stay there...

429
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,329
a month or two.

430
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,608
I'm just worried about you
being here all alone.

431
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,722
What are you talking about?

432
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,969
He won't be alone.
I'll be here with him.

433
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,003
I'm just worried about...

434
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,043
who's going to take care of you.

435
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,649
He knows how to take care of himself,
but you wanted to wait, so we did.

436
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,048
But we're to be there by 6:00.
You know how far it is.

437
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,489
You can, um...

438
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,447
You can come visit me every Sunday.

439
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,964
Not the first two, but after that.

440
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,482
They won't let him inside.
You know how strict they are.

441
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,769
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna say good-bye to her.

442
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,804
- You just did!
- That wasn't a real one.

443
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,366
You know how emotional
your mother gets.

444
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,563
You don't want to make
a big scene, do you?

445
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,205
Huh?

446
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,243
Okay. Big boy.

447
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,803
Lucky bastard!

448
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,003
Damn, slice!

449
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,929
Oh, here we go.

450
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,325
Say, clean this ball off for me,
will you, sonny?

451
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,850
Hey!

452
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,281
What's taking so long over there?

453
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,643
- Excuse me a second, please.
- Sonny!

454
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,888
Throw me the goddamn ball!

455
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,320
Didn't you put the ball
in the paddle?

456
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,482
No, I put it in there.

457
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,483
Superb.

458
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,168
What's this kid trying to do to me?
He keeps handing me niblicks.

459
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,482
No wonder I'm high ball.

460
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,171
And now you've lost
my three-dollar Kro-Flite.

461
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,323
Now I'll probably miss
the damn putt!

462
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,408
Don't worry about it.

463
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,411
- How was I supposed to know?
- I said don't worry about it.

464
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,046
Go home.
I'll take care of this.

465
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,328
There's other ways to make money.

466
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,643
A transcribed moment of perfect ease.

467
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,850
Lunched with Bill, honey
He wants us to come out Thursday

468
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,123
I don't want to.
We have to go on the streetcar.

469
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,561
Yes, Your Ladyship.
It seems there was a depression.

470
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,614
That isn't fair. It's
that long walk up that hill.

471
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,632
- Hello?
- Who is it?

472
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:06,595
Ella.

473
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,727
Hi.

474
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,645
Um, I was wondering
if I could see your baby canaries.

475
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,527
They haven't hatched yet.

476
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,042
Oh. Can I come see them
when they do hatch?

477
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,491
Sure.

478
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,687
Thanks.

479
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,962
I... well...

480
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,050
Would you like to have a hot dog?

481
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,604
Would you like
to listen to some music?

482
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,245
Well...

483
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,447
I love this song.

484
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,762
Would you like to dance?

485
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,047
I dance better on a full stomach.

486
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,367
Come on.
It's halfway over already.

487
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,125
Okay.

488
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,642
You haven't done this before.

489
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,723
No.

490
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,010
Uh...

491
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,646
- That was my foot.
- Oh. Sorry.

492
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,484
It's okay.

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,086
Ella? Ella?
Mrs. McShane!

499
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,320
Mrs. McShane!

500
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,801
Aaron, raise her head up.

501
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,842
Here. Shh.

502
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,208

She'll be all right.

508
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,210
I'm sorry.

509
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,368
I didn't mean it, I swear...

510
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,960
Oh, Aaron, it is not your fault.

511
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,169
Ella hasn't had
one of these in a long time.

512
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,723
Was it awful?

513
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,524
Ella?

514
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,562
We should let Aaron be on his way.

515
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,246
I want to know
if I did anything really bad.

516
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,201
You were sick,
and now you're better.

517
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,210
It doesn't happen very often.

518
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,322
J-Just when we run out of medicine.

519
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,723
Well, I have to go back to my room.

520
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,366
Will you come visit me again?

521
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,046
Sure.

522
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,685
Promise?

523
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,764
Promise.

524
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,165
Krilby, that new soap for the bath...

525
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,521
presents a transcribed
minute message... "The Tip."

526
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,450
Just a minute, boy,
till I open this suitcase.

527
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,847
Put this bar of soap in the bath.

528
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,440
Yes, sir, but the hotel
furnishes bath soap.

529
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,801
I'm not taking any chances.

530
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,201
I carry Krilby soap.
Here's a tip for you.

531
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,085
- Thank you, sir.
- And here's another tip for you:

532
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,282
Just try bathing with Krilby...

533
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,011
And you'll never go back
to sissy soaps again.

534
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,124
There's a man who has discovered
the secret of better bathing...

535
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,481
Aaron...

536
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,082
how do you spell "proprietor"?

537
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,371
P-R-O-P-R-I-E-T-O-R.

538
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,801
"I-O-R."

539
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,962
What is that anyway?

540
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,005
Aha! This is the application form
for the Hamilton Watch Company...

541
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,408
with a personal recommendation
from Mr. Sid Gutman.

542
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,055
It's a bit more concrete
than the canary business,

543
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:48,267
I'm telling you. But
it's only a formality.

544
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,517
I've got the job
practically in my pocket.

545
00:40:50,543 --> 00:40:51,946
What about the WPA job?

546
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,566
What happens if you get both?

547
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,082
Having two job offers will be the
least of our problems, believe me.

548
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,930
How do you make this soup?
This is good soup.

549
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,442
- It's saltier this time.
- It's tasty.

550
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,370
- Yeah. Pretty good.
- It's good.

551
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,962
You were telling the truth.

552
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,402
But of course.

553
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,087
For all I know, you promise
lots of things to lots of people.

554
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,407
For all you know...

555
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,403
that's true.

556
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,443
I usually operate...

557
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,767
on a cash-only basis.
I'm making an exception.

558
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,604
I understand.

559
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,007
You got a name?

560
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,691
Thomiros.

561
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,882
Mr. Thomiros.

562
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,002
What kind of name is that?

563
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,604
Greek.

564
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,641
Aaron, I, uh...

565
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,086
I just wanted you to know
I put your address...

566
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,931
into the records
the way you told me.

567
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,485
Oh.

568
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,482
Okay. Thanks.

569
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,048
Hey! Hey! Come here!

570
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,162
Come here, you little bohunk.

571
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,322
You don't know
what trouble you're in.

572
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,728
You told me your old man
parks his car in a parking lot.

573
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,362
What is that right over there?
What do you call that?

574
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,643
- That can't be my father's.
- Oh, so I'm a liar now?

575
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,444
Let me tell you something.

576
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,968
I know that's your father's car,
and I'm gonna give him a ticket...

577
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,368
It can't be. He parked in the alley
behind the Davidson house.

578
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,648
Aha!

579
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,843
Stupid, stupid!

580
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,922
Lester, look.
The Repleviners.

581
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,771
- Burns told them where the Ford is.
- Where is it?

582
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,486
Behind the Davidson house,
but I don't have the keys.

583
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,523
- Come on.
- It doesn't have gas!

584
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,364
- Come on!
- All right.

585
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,042
What, you gonna push?
Get in.

586
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,041
All right, hit the brake.
Hit the brakes!

587
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,401
Hit the brakes, Aaron.
Hit the brake.

588
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,329
Hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes!

589
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,003
Shit.

590
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,803
Watch out!

591
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,531
Gotcha!

592
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,201
Scared ya?

593
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,761
Look what I found.

594
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,570
- Dad.
- Aaron.

595
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,524
- You're not gonna believe this.
- I have to show you something.

596
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,763
- Patrolman Burns...
- This way. Come have a look.

597
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,370
Watch it.

598
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,961
I told you they were the best, huh?

599
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,289
Aren't they beautiful?
It's a king's ransom. Look at this.

600
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,887
Here. Signed by the president
of the Hamilton Watch Company...

601
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,011
stating I'm an official representative
for Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma.

602
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,922
What about Missouri?

603
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,162
I didn't get
the territory I asked for.

604
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,124
But you know,
beggars can't be choosers.

605
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,288
You leaving right now?

606
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,802
Don't you worry.
I've got it all arranged.

607
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,526
You see, most of the watches
are just display models.

608
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,648
They don't have any works inside.

609
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,765
But I took two who had works, and I
gave one to Manny at the Woodbine...

610
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,687
so by the end of the day, you just walk
in and they give you a nice big dinner.

611
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,724
It won't be roast beef, but
something healthy like liverwurst.

612
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,922
The other one I gave to Desot...

613
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,441
and he gave us
$17 credit on our bill.

614
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,610
You see, as long as you pay them a
little something, they won't bother us.

615
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,883
And here is 25 cents
for spending money.

616
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,407
There you go. Here.

617
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,602
You're gonna miss graduation.

618
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,609
Aaron, you know...

619
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,808
of course I want to be there...

620
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,802
seeing you getting your diploma.

621
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,883
But I have no choice.

622
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,810
I have to be in Davenport, Iowa,
first thing Monday morning.

623
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,809
You can see Sullivan!

624
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,402
- I wanna give him some marbles.
- No. No, I won't.

625
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,641
Keokuk isn't on my route.

626
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,485
They have me spread out
all over the map.

627
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,041
- You know when you're gonna be back?
- I just can't tell.

628
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,484
But I'll be back as soon as I can,
because I'll be very worried.

629
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,961
Is there any place
I can write to you?

630
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,005
What happens if I need to get
in touch with you for something?

631
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,447
I guess there isn't.

632
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,007
I'll be moving from town to town.

633
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,407
It's bad luck
your mother is sick just now.

634
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,530
I should put this off,
but you know how jobs are.

635
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,642
They're not gonna let you
leave with that.

636
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,084
Mr. Desot said I could take a few things,
as long as I let them inspect it.

637
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,328
After all, I paid them $17.

638
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,364
Hey, walk me over to the car.

639
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,929
The car!

640
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,047
Lucky for me,
you boys saved the car.

641
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,891
Otherwise I wouldn't
have been able to go.

642
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,570
Yeah.

643
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,411
Well, I'd drive you back...

644
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,410
but I can't let
the Repleviners see me.

645
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,042
Listen to me, Aaron.
You're going to be okay.

646
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,811
You're a smart boy.
You're very smart.

647
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,287
I tell you
how smart you are.

648
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,002
When you were less than a year old,

649
00:50:11,028 --> 00:50:13,430
your mother was in the
sanitarium with consumption...

650
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,449
and you would cry every night.

651
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,152
The first few times, I picked
you up, and you stopped,

652
00:50:18,178 --> 00:50:19,874
so I realized you wanted attention.

653
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,130
So the next time, I got a glass of
cold water and stood over the crib...

654
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,325
and I said, "This is a glass of cold
water. Stop crying, or you'll be sorry."

655
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,523
But you kept crying, so I poured
the water in your face...

656
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,603
and you stopped crying
just like that.

657
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,883
From then on,
when you cried, all I had to do...

658
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,243
was show you the glass of water,
and you'd stop crying.

659
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,364
Now, that's a smart baby
for you, eh?

660
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,681
You be a mensch.

661
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,603
Hmm?

662
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,605
And then to be fooled
by a wooden horse.

663
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,961
A wooden horse!

664
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,564
Oh, Aaron. Hello.

665
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,330
Thank you.

666
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,010
Come in.

667
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,767
Come in.
Lydia, this is Aaron.

668
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,484
- Aaron, Lydia.
- Hello.

669
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,641
Lydia, uh, works for the hotel.

670
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,889
Don't you, Lydia?

671
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,606
Uh, what is it that you do?

672
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,329
She's in the customer service department.
It's difficult work.

673
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,042
But it pays well.

674
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,041
And there's always an opening
for someone with a certain...

675
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,401
type of ambition.

676
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,486
<i>♪ Maybe he's lonesome ♪</i>

677
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,204
<i>♪ Maybe he's blue ♪</i>

678
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,010
<i>♪ Maybe he's unhappy ♪</i>

679
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,322
<i>♪ Maybe I am too ♪</i>

680
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,569
- Smart-ass.
- Thank you.

681
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,126
<i>♪ Maybe, who knows ♪</i>

682
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,805
Oh, no.

683
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,203
I did it as a favor, actually.

684
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,326
Oh.

685
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:35,376
<i>♪ Maybe he's loving
someone else instead ♪</i>

686
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,321
I love it.
Outclassed by a street urchin.

687
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,568
Yes.

688
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,161
A lesson for us all.

00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,443

692
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,122
Excuse me.
Can you tell me where Manny is?

693
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,449
- You wanna talk to Manny?
- Yeah.

694
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,010
Mr. Navarro...

695
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,205
there's somebody here
who wants to speak with Manny

696
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,641
Are you Manny?

697
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,127
I'm the owner.
What do you want with Manny?

698
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,086
Well, my father sort of had
an arrangement with Manny.

699
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,441
Yeah? Huh.

700
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,882
It turns out a lot of people
had an arrangement with Manny...

701
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,367
but Manny never asked me
about no arrangements.

702
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,609
So I just fired
the son of a bitch.

703
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,481
B-B-But my father gave him a watch.
An expensive watch.

704
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,570
I didn't notice no watch, kid.

705
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,346
He said he was gonna give
me a meal at dinnertime.

706
00:53:46,372 --> 00:53:47,835
Look, I just told you:

707
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,248
The bastard stole from me,
I fired him... end of story.

708
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,091
Well, what can I get
with a quarter?

709
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,363
You could buy a plate lunch.

710
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,290
I need something that'll last.

711
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,291
Yeah?
How about 20 dinner rolls?

712
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,402
That should last you.

713
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,322
- Hi, Mrs. McShane.
- Hello, Aaron.

714
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,690
I was wondering if maybe Ella
wanted to see my baby canaries...

715
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,882
before I bring them
to the pet store.

716
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,641
Uh, I'm sure she would, Aaron,
but she really can't.

717
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,087
She's had another attack,
I'm afraid.

718
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,282
Oh.

719
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,449
Actually, I think we're going
to be leaving soon...

720
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,562
to stay with my sister in Illinois.

721
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,967
Her husband's a doctor...

722
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,924
and I think
it'll be better for Ella.

723
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,963
Well, Mr. Yano?

724
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,367
They're very nice birds,
aren't they?

725
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,045
Yes, Mr. Farley.

726
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,845
Very nice. Very healthy.

727
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,209
- All females.
- Are you sure?

728
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,328
Oh, yes, very sure.

729
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,090
I'll be darned.

730
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,527
A whole litter like that.

731
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,330
- Bye.
- Bye.

732
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,681
That's a tough break.

733
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,320
I don't understand.
What happened?

734
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,647
You got five females.

735
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,730
Females don't sing, so there's
no market for them. I'm sorry.

736
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,043
They're not worth anything?
I can't bring them back home.

737
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,966
The most I could do
is give you 50 cents for the lot.

738
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,129
Look, I'm really sorry
it can't be more.

739
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,044
That's the first time
I've known that to happen.

740
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,690
Go in. She'll love it. It's wonderful.

741
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,087
Go on. Go.
It's all right.

742
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,250

Then each of you
will be called by name...

747
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,289
and given your diploma.

748
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,687
You'll then return
to your assigned seat and wait...

749
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,162
till all the names
have been called.

752
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,530
Aaron?

753
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,051
Hi.

754
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,050
I was wondering if you were going
to the reception at Billy Thompson's.

755
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,323
Yeah, I'm planning on it.

756
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,683
Afterwards, my parents are going
to take me out for a special dinner...

757
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,649
and they said
I could bring someone.

758
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,728
I thought maybe you'd like to go.

759
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,889
Yeah!
That-That-That sounds fine.

760
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,698
Great. I'll see you at Billy's,
and we can leave from there.

761
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:57,387
Yes.

762
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,289
I-I mean, good.

763
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,767
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

764
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,209
Bye.

765
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,729
Mail for 309.

766
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,724

768
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,089
Yeah, who's there?

769
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,282
It's me... Aaron.

770
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,794
Hi.

771
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,996
Hey, I told you my mom's sick.
You can't keep knocking.

772
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:17,850
What is that?

773
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:20,513
This is all I have to
wear to graduation.

774
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,251
The pants don't button,
the shirt's up there...

775
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,647
All right, I'll get you something.
When's the ceremony?

776
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,684
- Noon tomorrow.
- Wow. Shit.

777
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,605
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I could've got something easy.

778
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,809
- I didn't know until just now.
- All right.

779
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,447
Well, I got an idea.
Might be a little risky.

780
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,489
You up for it?

781
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,648
- Well...
- Good. Come on.

782
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,201
You sure we should be doing this?

783
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,687
The hotel stole
this stuff from these people.

784
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,326
- What about Ben?
- Ben's a trained dog.

785
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,329
My mom used to tell me...

786
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,445
you could teach a dog to walk
on its hind legs. It's still a dog.

787
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,244
Yeah.

788
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,285
Looks like somebody's
got you tied up.

789
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,524
It's a picture
Mr. Sandoz did of me.

790
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,165
Not bad.

791
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,049
What is it?

792
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,929
It's payday.

793
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,362
I think I got something.

794
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,645
Hey, Les.

795
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,286
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

796
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,368
Don't mention it.

797
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,727
And I really mean don't mention it.

798
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,008
What do you think?

799
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,322
Looks wonderful.

800
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,727
I wish I was going
to your graduation.

801
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,167
Well, I... You'll be better off
with your aunt, right?

802
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,328
I guess so.

803
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,846
But what are you gonna do
here all alone?

804
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,082
I don't know. I'll be okay.

805
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,451
Oh, Aaron, knowing you is the only
good thing that happened to me here.

806
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,324
Congratulations...

807
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,090
all of you.

808
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,043
I now take great pleasure...

809
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,562
in presenting the Admiral George
Dewey Achievement Award...

810
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,331
to that member
of the graduating class...

811
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,488
who possesses that combination...

812
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,082
of scholastic ability
and good character...

813
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,931
that best exemplifies
what we seek...

814
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,681
in our young people
going forth to a higher education.

815
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,564
Please come forward...

816
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,921
Aaron Kurlander.

817
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,205
That's you, Aaron.
You won. Go on up.

818
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,646
Each winner of the Admiral George
Dewey Award for Achievement...

819
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,922
could be described...

820
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,010
as hardworking...

821
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,600
creative, and honest...

822
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,604
and Aaron Kurlander
is no exception.

823
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,286
He serves as both an example...

824
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,006
and an inspiration to us all.

825
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,122
Thank you, Aaron.

826
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,442
Well, how do you like it?

827
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,490
- What?
- The car. How do you like the car?

828
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,491
Oh, it's colossal.
Stupendous. Whose is it?

829
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,807
What do you mean?
It's mine.

830
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,725
- How'd you get it?
- Well, you know.

831
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:10,447
Anyway, what are you doing after this
party at Billy what's-his-name's?

832
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,682
Dinner with Christina Sebastian.

833
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,848
Wow! A real date, huh?

834
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,088
You got all your moves polished up?

835
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,981
Lester, look, she's not
that kind of girl.

836
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:20,911
Oh, okay.

837
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,529
- Hey, Aaron, can I see your medal?
- Yeah, sure.

838
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,041
Oh. Thanks.

839
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,767
- Hi.
- Hi.

840
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,531
I was just wondering
if you'd like to dance.

841
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,810
Sure.

842
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,722
Have you ever danced before?

843
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,441
Once, but it didn't go too well.

844
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,086
Well, it's very simple.
Don't worry.

845
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:36,001
<i>♪ I'm lonesome and blue
but when I look at you ♪</i>

846
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,009
Congratulations on your award.

847
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,885
Oh, yeah, thank you.

848
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,082
Who was that boy
that dropped you off?

849
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,089
Oh, that was Lester.

850
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,249
He kind of takes care
of me sometimes.

851
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,522
I see.

852
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,688
Will your parents
be joining us for dinner?

853
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,441
No. That's, uh...
that's impossible.

854
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,685
- Were they at graduation?
- No, they weren't.

855
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,246
Are they away?

856
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,926
- Sort of.
- Where?

857
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,441
I can't really say.

858
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,848
You don't know where they are?
Don't they tell you?

859
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,611
Well, they're not able to...
exactly.

860
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,726
But they could just call, couldn't they,
or write to you if they...

861
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,365
They're missing.

862
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,171
They're missing?
What do you mean?

863
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,769
Well, uh, my parents are archaeologists,
and they were on an expedition...

864
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,521
and nobody's heard from them in a
while, so I guess they're missing.

865
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,250
Oh, I'm sorry.

866
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,409
I hope they're okay.
Are people looking for them?

867
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,410
Yeah, there's a search party
and everything.

868
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,046
I'm not that worried.
They've been lost lots of times.

869
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,686
<i>- ♪ If I had a girl like you ♪♪</i>
- Oh.

870
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,209
I need to sit down for a moment,
if you don't mind.

871
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,446
Sure.

872
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,722
What's the matter?

873
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,811
Aaron just told me his parents
are missing on an expedition!

874
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,002
My grades were just as good...

875
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:26,642
but everyone knew they were going to
give the award to the teacher's pet.

876
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:30,048
Then all the girls feel sorry for
him because he's a charity case.

877
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,130
What a phony!
And did you see that outfit?

878
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,926
I haven't seen clothes that funny
since the circus was here.

879
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,168
They don't even look
like they're his.

880
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,284
My brother says there's a poor kid
like him every year...

881
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,971
and they always
get special treatment.

882
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,489
Did you hear about Aaron...

883
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,807
They're lost on an expedition.

884
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,531
Say, Aaron,
Walter Eamons said...

885
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,325
that Betty Haskins said
that your parents...

886
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,011
were captured by natives
on a tiger hunt.

887
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,203
But I thought your father was
a pilot flying for the government.

888
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,804
Excuse me.
I have to use your bathroom.

889
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,364
- Aaron!
- Aaron, congratulations!

890
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,284
Thank you.
Excuse me.

891
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,769
Did you graduate?

892
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,250
Yeah.

893
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,927
Got somethin' for you.

894
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,610
Really?

895
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,444
Someday
I'll teach you how to pop.

896
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,370
Thanks.

897
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,287
But my father said he paid
a $17 credit on our bill.

898
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,643
That's true, Aaron, but that
still leaves an unpaid balance...

899
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,650
of $172.

900
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,604
The watch held the bank off
for a week or so...

901
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,722
but now they're gonna take action.

902
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,089
Three days, Mr. Desot.
My father's out in Kansas.

903
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,362
- I don't even know where.
- I understand...

904
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,926
but there's nothing
I can do about it.

905
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,044
I spent 25 years in this hotel.
Started off as a clerk.

906
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,687
Now the bank gives the orders.

907
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,802
But you could call
and tell them...

908
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,685
my father has a job
but he's traveling, right?

909
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,690
They simply don't care
what I have to say about this.

910
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,922
I don't have any power.

911
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,725
They wanna get rid
of everyone on the third floor...

912
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,968
and just rent rooms
to the dancehall girls.

913
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,923
That's where the money is.

914
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,288
All they care about is the money

915
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,243
I would suggest that you...

916
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,409
contact your nearest relative
and see if they can't help.

917
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,488
I'm... I'm sorry.

918
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,409
Hey, Mom?

919
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,727
Mom?

920
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,481
Um, is Mrs. Kurlander up there?

921
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,245
Aaron?

922
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,925
Hi.

923
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,447
I can't believe it's you.

924
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,242
I'm so glad to see you.

925
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,604
I miss you.

926
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,409
So? How are you?

927
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,562
Have you heard anything from Dad?

928
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,650
He sent me a postcard
from Oklahoma.

929
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,762
He said the car broke down.

930
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,130
- Why? Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

931
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,921
Yeah, everything's fine.
I was just wondering where he was.

932
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,411
When do you think you'll be coming home?

933
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,002
The doctor said the spot is closing
much sooner than he expected.

934
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,248
When are they gonna let you out?

935
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,767
I don't know exactly, but soon.

936
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,884
Hey, Mr. Sandoz!

937
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,968
Mr. Sandoz!

938
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,650
It's me... Aaron!

939
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,669
I really think
there's a misconception

940
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:28,595
that he's totally in
love with himself...

941
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:32,605
because after all, he did have
a girlfriend... named Echo.

942
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,690
- Echo.
- Echo.

943
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,366
Who is it?

944
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,403
It's me... Aaron.

945
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,962
- Ah, Aaron.
- Hi.

946
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,845
- I was just wondering...
- Come in, come in.

947
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,766
You remember Lydia, don't you?

948
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,770
- Yeah.
- Why don't you put something on?

949
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,766
I have something on.
He doesn't mind. Do you?

950
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,201
See? He likes it.

951
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,641
- What?
- Woodbine.

952
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,562
Oh, come on in.

953
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,489
Over here.

954
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,124
Where's the corn?

955
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,402
I'm sorry, ma'am.
We're out of corn today.

956
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,847
Jesus Christ!

957
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,201
Cash or credit? Ha!

958
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,322
No, I'll sign for her.

959
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,521
Perhaps you could spare one or
two bites to young Aaron here.

960
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,449
Oh, no.
Really, I couldn't.

961
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,406
When young Aaron works for his meal
the way I did, he can have some.

962
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,683
- That wouldn't be feasible, would it?
- With you, who knows?

963
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,282
Uh...

964
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,928
the reason I came is I was wondering if
you'd like to buy my cigar-band collection.

965
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,289
Your cigar-band collection?

966
01:16:04,315 --> 01:16:06,626
You were the only one
who seemed interested.

967
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,566
I see, but why this sudden desire
to sell off this prize possession?

968
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,122
Well, I'm kind of low
on money, so...

969
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:17,050
- Join the club.
- They're trying to lock me out.

970
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,446
Who?

971
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,250
The bank that runs the hotel.

972
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,761
I thought Mr. Desot ran the hotel.

973
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,724
Well, Mr. Desot told me
if I didn't pay some money...

974
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,922
the bank was gonna lock me out.

975
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:31,169
I'll tell you what:
Come around tomorrow afternoon...

976
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,641
and we'll have a word
with Mr. Desot.

977
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,489
Really?

978
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,170
- You mean it?
- I mean it.

979
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,487
- Thank you.
- Yeah, right.

980
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,290
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

981
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,529
Good. All right.
We'll see you tomorrow, then.

982
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,642
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

983
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,927
What?

984
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,490
"Dear Nathan,
something important has come up...

985
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,608
that I must tell you about.

986
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,690
It seems that some time ago,
the children in Sullivan's class...

987
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:08,287
were exposed to a new disease
called "kidney box fever."

988
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,761
The symptoms
don't show up for a few months...

989
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,521
and the disease can be cured quite
easily with a blood transfusion...

990
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,246
from a relative,
especially a brother.

991
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,091
Therefore, I think it's best
if you send Sullivan home...

992
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,044
right away,
while there's still hope.

993
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,640
Best regards, Eric."

994
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,848
Lester?
Mrs....

995
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,646
You goin' out?

996
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,483
Yeah. For a minute.

997
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,168
Move, move.
Get the door.

998
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,760
Hey! Lester!

999
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,823
Come on, get in!

1000
01:18:51,849 --> 01:18:54,546
I got him, just like I said,
the little Yid.

1001
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,688
And you better watch yourself.

1002
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,842
We're cleaning up
all the dirt around here.

1003
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,247
I got something of his
I oughta give him.

1004
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,011
- I said get in!
- Why can't I give it to him?

1005
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,407
- It's his. I oughta give it back.
- Go ahead.

1006
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,291
- Make it snappy.
- Here.

1007
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,803
Here's your knife, eh?

1008
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,124
Thanks a lot.

1009
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,603
- Get in!
- Come on.

1010
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,529
Let's go.

1011
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,170
Hey!

1012
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,888
Come back and pick up them tools,
and we'll call it even.

1013
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,324
Let's go! I know you're in there.

1014
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,361
It's not fair!
It hasn't been three days yet.

1015
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,529
So what's a day or two
to a deadbeat?

1016
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,202
- I'm gonna tell Mr. Desot.
- How you gonna do that?

1017
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,328
Homing pigeon?

1018
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,922
- Mr. Mungo's gonna talk to him.
- Mr. Mungo?

1019
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:37,931
He can't even get the Woodbine
to bring him food no more.

1020
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,884
I'd say he's almost
as bad off as you are.

1021
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,645
You're gonna have to come
out of there eventually.

1022
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,240
Me, I'll just be
out there in my chair...

1023
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,523
eating three meals a day
till you do...

1024
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,041
unless you wanna
surrender right now.

1025
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:55,401
No!

1026
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,251
I'll be seeing you.

1027
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,365
Hello?

1028
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,528
Mr. Mungo?

1029
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,210
Hello?

1030
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,522
This is KMOX, the voice of...

1031
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,450
Thank you.

1032
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,242
And now, ready to go again,
Pepper Martin...

1033
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,480
How's it goin' in there?

1034
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,922
"Hello, Billy." "Hello, Aaron."

1035
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,565
"How are you?"

1036
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,364
"I'm fine."

1037
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,205
"What did you have
for lunch today?"

1038
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,800
"I had filet of sole."

1039
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,325
"Oh."

1040
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,568
"What did you have?"

1041
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,648
"I had a dinner roll...

1042
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,489
and some water."

1043
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,130
No.

1044
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,209
Yeah, ham.

1045
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,409
Mmm!

1046
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,084
Mmm!

1047
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,841
Bastard.

1048
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,211
Bastard! Son of a...

1049
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,489
Son of a bitch!

1050
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,366
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1051
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,883
Uncle Nathan sent me
when he got Dad's letter.

1052
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,049
- He killed himself?
- Mm-hmm.

1053
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,441
Right across the hall.

1054
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,085
Gee.

1055
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,521
And the McShanes
moved to Illinois...

1056
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,961
and Mr. Sandoz
is living in a Hooverville.

1057
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,528
So you're the only person left?

1058
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,125
Pretty much.

1059
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,882
I have to tell you something.

1060
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,446
What?

1061
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,522
Okay. Wait.
Move your hand out a little.

1062
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,324
Now try it.

1063
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,966
That's pretty good.
You kept your hand on the ground.

1064
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,481
But you gotta get
your knuckles down like that.

1065
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,444
You really gotta twist your arm.

1066
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,211
That was fast, but...

1067
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,846
Shh.

1068
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,887
Aaron! Why do you...
Wh... Why do y...

1069
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,809
Sullivan?

1070
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,445
Dad!

1071
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,642
Sullivan, what are you doing here?

1072
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:51,327
What are you doing here?

1073
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,886
- Uncle Nathan said...
- That's sort of a long story.

1074
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,685
Oh, never mind. Tell me later.

1075
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,802
It's so good to see you both.

1076
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,481
I knew you could take care of yourselves.
You know why I came home?

1077
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,568
Because I've got the WPA job.

1078
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,078
- I'm a clerk, first-class.
- Great!

1079
01:31:07,104 --> 01:31:07,788
Wow!

1080
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,645
You know what's great?
It's the salary.

1081
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,003
Sixty-five dollars a month.

1082
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:16,049
- Sixty-five dollars!
- Yeah!

1083
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,164
Didn't I tell you not to worry?
But hey!

1084
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,248
Let's not sit around.
Let's get your mother...

1085
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,761
and see Donald Miller
at the Carleton Court Apartments.

1086
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,163
- How about that?
- What about all our stuff?

1087
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,489
We buy new stuff.
After all, $65 a month.

1088
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,965
No!

1089
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,880
I'm not leaving
my stuff here for Ben.

1090
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,721
But I've got it all arranged.
Your mom is waiting.

1091
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,848
Donald Miller is waiting.
We could move...

1092
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,611
into the new apartment right away,

1093
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:58,849
Aaron, the only way
you could take your things...

1094
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,527
is if I pay the bill,
and I'm not going to pay...

1095
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,688
the bill, okay?

1096
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,891
Why is it so important to you?

1097
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,210
It just is. We'll meet you
at the Carleton Court.

1098
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:17,041
"We"?
Sullivan, you're coming with me.

1099
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,522
I'm staying with Aaron.

1100
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:34,086
Well, I'm going.

1101
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,406
You'll never get
your things past Ben.

1102
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,204
Never.

1103
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,962
What are we gonna do?

1104
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,651
Back up!

1105
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,762
I'm gonna drop it.

1106
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,845
I'll get the suitcases.
You take the other stuff.

1107
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,769
Okay.

1108
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:03,689
Who're you looking
for there, slick?

1109
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,767
None of your business.

1110
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,571
Dressed awful warm, ain't ya?

1111
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,602
A friend of mine once said...

1112
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,650
you could teach a dog
to walk on its hind legs...

1113
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,649
but it's still a dog.

1114
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,329
What did I tell ya last time?
Now gimme that apple!

1115
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,440
Or I'll put your little
chicken ass under the jail!

1116
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,807
- Gimme that apple!
- Hey, big butt!

1117
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,880
Better watch your step,
you big bohunk.

1118
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,322
You don't know what kind of trouble
you're in, you little...

1119
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:05,321
Get out of here!

1120
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:11,450
You little bastard!
Get out of here! You...

1121
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:15,963
You son of a bitch! You!

1122
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,887
I can let you boys stay in here
until your parents show up.

1123
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,207
Then I'll give the keys
to your father.

1124
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,043
Oh, thanks.

1125
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,891
- What are these?
- They're paints.

1126
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,771
- We're gonna deliver them to Mr. Sandoz.
- I get it.

1127
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,922
Can you hear me?

1128
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,084
Yes.

1129
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,402
Can you hear me?

1130
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,289
Yes, I can hear you.

1131
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,929
Wow!

1132
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:26,763
- Aaron? Sullivan?
- Hello!

1133
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,564
They're here!

1134
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:32,008
- Hello!
- Mom!

1135
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,043
Oh!

1136
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:36,845
Hello! Hi!

1137
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,621
I think you're taller.
He's grown a bit.

1138
01:38:40,647 --> 01:38:42,345
- I think you're taller.
- Yeah.

1139
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,090
Mom...

1140
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,322
there's a lot of stuff in here.

1141
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,564
Don't you want to say
hello to your mother?
