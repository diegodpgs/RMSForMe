1
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:01,231
Wake up

2
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:05,496
Logan, you are here. I couldn't
believe it when they told me.

3
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:08,871
Logan 6.

4
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:11,767
It's not every day they
authorize a new Sandman.

5
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:14,503
I'll tell you, Francis, that's him.

6
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:16,011
Maybe, maybe not.

7
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:18,447
What does it matter?
He isn't yours anymore.

8
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:23,587
All right, you want me to wake him?

9
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:26,252
Break-in.

10
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,392
Now you've done it.

11
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:30,792
Scanners report intrusion. Identify.

12
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:34,228
Logan 5, Francis 7,
authorized duty quadrant.

13
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:36,527
Intrusion accidental.

14
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:40,433
Clear, Logan 5. Clear, Francis 7.

15
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:45,577
All right, Francis, I'm with you.

16
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:09,231
Only the crazies hang around nursery.

17
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:11,666
There'll be a couple
of new Sandmen tomorrow.

18
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:12,701
How do you know?

19
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:14,897
Some of our guys are
on Carrousel tonight.

20
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:16,803
And Sandmen always renew. I know.

21
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:19,310
But you don't know. You just assume.

22
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,777
One for one. What everyone's
been taught. One for one.

23
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:25,110
Why not? That's how everything works.

24
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:28,481
Keeps everything in balance.
One is terminated, one is born.

25
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:30,952
Simple, logical, perfect.

26
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:34,555
- You have a better system?
- Of course not.

27
00:04:34,794 --> 00:04:38,958
At least I wonder about it sometimes.
Not like you with your automatic routine.

28
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:41,394
You sound like a sleep
teacher with a stuck tape.

29
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,830
Leave it alone, it's perfect.

30
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:52,042
You know, Logan, you wonder a lot.

31
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:53,905
Too much for a Sandman.

32
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:56,479
Why were you so angry just then?

33
00:04:56,683 --> 00:04:58,082
What did he do to you?

34
00:04:58,284 --> 00:05:01,310
That red's going to
run. I can always tell.

35
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:03,545
Did you ever see Francis 8?

36
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:06,821
I never even visited
nursery before tonight.

37
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:11,795
You know, when you
question, it slows you down.

38
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:16,161
I don't know. What makes you so curious?

39
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:18,627
You know who his seed-mother was?

40
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:22,398
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.

41
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:23,700
Good.

42
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:28,574
Look at the crowd.
Good Carrousel tonight.

43
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:39,384
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.

44
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:43,353
Year of the city, 2274.

45
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:45,792
Carrousel begins.

46
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:56,763
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.

47
00:05:56,974 --> 00:06:00,637
Year of the city, 2274.

48
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:03,508
Carrousel begins.

49
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:19,824
Would you mind?

50
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:22,362
Thanks a lot.

51
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,134
A few over there could
have been his seed-mother.

52
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:36,877
Only a few?

53
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:38,975
You're just not trying.

54
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,720
Capricorn 15s...

55
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,859
...born 2244...

56
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,358
...enter the Carrousel.

57
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:54,397
This is the time of renewal.

58
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,851
Be strong...

59
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,529
...and you will be renewed.

60
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,461
Identify.

61
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:40,775
Rise.

62
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,078
Renew! Renew!

63
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,035
Come on!

64
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:45,027
Higher!

65
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,792
Renew! Renew!

66
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:56,067
Renew!

67
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,711
Renew!

68
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:14,361
Renew!

69
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,925
Affirmative!

70
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,332
Renew!

71
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,479
Run, runner!

72
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:52,914
Did you hear him? Run!

73
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:20,882
- Hold it!
- Runner!

74
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,907
Runner terminated, 0.31.

75
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,586
Ready for cleanup.

76
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,794
Request identity check.

77
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:11,234
Affirmative.

78
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:33,618
He was good, wasn't he?

79
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:36,754
Showed he had some
life in him in the end.

80
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,557
That was a great shot you made.

81
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:42,324
You kept missing him.
I had to do something.

82
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:47,602
It's crazy. He could
have renewed on Carrousel.

83
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:49,295
Now he's finished forever.

84
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:50,940
Why do they run?

85
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:26,195
Hello.

86
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:29,600
Welcome.

87
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:46,077
Please, no.

88
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:48,116
Please?

89
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:49,586
No?

90
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:54,423
Come on.

91
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:04,771
What's wrong?

92
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:07,006
You prefer women?

93
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:11,641
Well?

94
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:16,215
Nothing, I felt sad.

95
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,546
I put myself on the circuit.

96
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,117
It was a mistake.

97
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:21,755
Sad?

98
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:23,549
Why do you feel sad?

99
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,455
A friend of mine went on Carrousel.

100
00:16:26,962 --> 00:16:28,020
Now he's gone.

101
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:30,265
Yes, well...

102
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:31,899
...I'm sure he was renewed.

103
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:33,934
He was killed.

104
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:35,034
Like the others.

105
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:37,436
Killed? Why do you use that word?

106
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,871
Isn't that what you do? Kill?

107
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,680
I've never killed anyone in my life.

108
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,818
Sandmen terminate runners.

109
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,787
What's your name?

110
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,882
Jessica.

111
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,160
That's sad enough.

112
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:01,660
You're beautiful.

113
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:03,559
Let's have sex.

114
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:05,528
Then why are you wasting my time?

115
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,395
Why'd you put yourself on the circuit?

116
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,100
I thought I had to do something.

117
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,438
I told you it was a mistake...

118
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,609
...and I've changed my mind.

119
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,744
Because I'm a Sandman?

120
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,711
Am I your first?

121
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,142
Yes.

122
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,911
And I'm curious.

123
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,484
About what?

124
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,210
How a Sandman lives.

125
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,719
It's a little different
from most people...

126
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,451
...but I assure you we have the
same feelings as everybody else.

127
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,520
If you're feeling curious it's-

128
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,220
Not about that.

129
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,262
What, then?

130
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:42,299
Why is it wrong to run?

131
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,872
You shouldn't think such things...

132
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:50,642
...let alone talk about them.

133
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:53,946
Look, you know what to do.

134
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:56,707
You try like hell for renewal.

135
00:17:56,917 --> 00:18:00,148
Otherwise, when this
turns to black, that's it.

136
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:04,888
But if for some strange
reason you want to be 31...

137
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,118
...then you have the
same chance as everyone.

138
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:08,561
Like your friend.

139
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,160
Carrousel.

140
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,055
But...

141
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,127
...if you're one of the misfits...

142
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,368
...that's where I come in.

143
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:23,372
I didn't say that I would run.

144
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:24,874
I just...

145
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:28,942
How old are you?

146
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,878
I'm a 6.

147
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,984
I go red next year.

148
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:37,580
You're years away.

149
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,658
What quad do you live in?

150
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:43,090
IK.

151
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:47,192
You're quite sure you don't want to...?

152
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,997
It's nice to know you can nod.

153
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:54,638
It's nice to know you can do that too.

154
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,738
I've been looking all over for you.

155
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,174
We're having a party, right?

156
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:03,404
Hey, Francis.

157
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,116
They're great.

158
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:10,784
Let's fade out.

159
00:19:15,128 --> 00:19:16,959
Give me my screamer back.

160
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:18,756
They're mine now.

161
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:29,440
What happened?

162
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:31,872
- I lost a runner in Cathedral.
- How come?

163
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:33,443
Ran into some cubs.

164
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:35,543
One of them cut me all the way down.

165
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:37,149
Cubs.

166
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,906
I'm off to New You for repairs.

167
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:42,517
Get yourself a new face while
you're at it. They know you now.

168
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:47,457
I might look in on the
New You myself. Number 483.

169
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,088
- You? Why?
- It's that last runner.

170
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:52,230
He got a face change on Last Day.

171
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,661
If so, someone in 483
was trying to help him.

172
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,266
Check it out.

173
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:00,931
Got a runner in power center.

174
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,170
What's with you?

175
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:07,868
Last night.

176
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,410
You had a kicker.

177
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:11,514
She must have got him in the head.

178
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,762
Identify.

179
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,164
Clear, Francis 7.

180
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,881
There goes another one.

181
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:52,990
Why do they run instead
of going on Carrousel?

182
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:56,058
Good one.

183
00:20:57,362 --> 00:20:59,057
Runner terminated, power center.

184
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:03,960
7106, identification correct.

185
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:10,235
- See you in the hydro toner.
- Be right with you.

186
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,248
Logan 5...

187
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,853
...approach and identify.

188
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:10,431
Sit facing the screen, Logan 5.

189
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:19,233
Identify.

190
00:22:39,396 --> 00:22:42,159
Do you identify this object?

191
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:49,301
Negative.

192
00:22:50,406 --> 00:22:51,805
Question: What is it?

193
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:54,901
That is the name of the object. Ankh.

194
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:01,741
Do you identify this word...

195
00:23:01,952 --> 00:23:03,579
"... Sanctuary"?

196
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:06,918
Negative.

197
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:11,222
Sanctuary is a pre
- catastrophe code word...

198
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:13,895
...used for a place of immunity.

199
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,330
I don't understand.

200
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:19,626
The object ankh...

201
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:23,963
...has been identified with
the code word "Sanctuary. "

202
00:23:24,373 --> 00:23:26,432
The object and the word both relate...

203
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:30,133
...to runners who have
not been accounted for.

204
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:34,811
- Question-
- Hold.

205
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,352
Unaccounted runners: 1056.

206
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,817
You may state your question.

207
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:45,556
1056 unaccounted for?

208
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:47,385
The number is correct.

209
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:50,525
That's impossible.

210
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:54,626
Question: Maybe they
weren't all runners.

211
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:57,805
Maybe most of them reached
life renewal on Carrousel.

212
00:24:01,877 --> 00:24:03,242
Question:

213
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:05,578
Nobody reached renewal?

214
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,885
But everybody believes that some-

215
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:14,385
The question was answered.

216
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:22,063
You mean, nobody's ever been renewed?

217
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,591
The question has been answered.

218
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:30,370
You are authorized to
penetrate city seals...

219
00:24:30,572 --> 00:24:32,802
...and search outside the dome.

220
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:34,437
The seals?

221
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,039
Question: What seals?

222
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:38,911
Outside?

223
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:41,248
There's nothing outside.

224
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:45,208
You will find Sanctuary and destroy.

225
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:49,517
Question:

226
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:52,090
What if I need help
from another Sandman?

227
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:55,562
Negative. You will begin
assignment by becoming...

228
00:24:55,764 --> 00:24:57,958
...a runner seeking Sanctuary.

229
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,496
Question:

230
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:02,531
I'm only red six now.

231
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,402
How can I pretend that
I'm approaching Last Day?

232
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,833
Identify.

233
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:56,019
My life clock.

234
00:25:57,892 --> 00:25:59,917
Question: My life clock?

235
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:04,721
Retrogram complete.

236
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:07,523
Procedure 033-03.

237
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,867
But am I still red 6?

238
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:16,669
I had four more years.

239
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,637
I will get them back, won't I?

240
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:23,705
You will take the object ankh
with you for identification.

241
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:26,584
Question:

242
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,948
Do I get my four years back?

243
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,954
What the hell took you so long?

244
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,095
It was...

245
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,629
...the debriefing.

246
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,132
It was more complicated than usual.

247
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,497
Come on, get in the water.

248
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,243
Did you ever see anybody renew?

249
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:06,611
You've been skulling out too much.
First nursery, and now silly questions.

250
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,877
But did you?

251
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:10,985
Did I what?

252
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,278
See anybody renewed?

253
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,155
Of course.

254
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,150
Anybody we know?

255
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,789
Look...

256
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,430
...get into the water.

257
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:24,293
You need it more than I do.

258
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,933
Francis, I have to talk to you.

259
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,601
I'll see you.

260
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,550
Here I am.

261
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:44,380
Now tell me why.

262
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:46,045
I couldn't get you out of my mind.

263
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,452
I'm the most beautiful woman
you ever saw, I suppose.

264
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:50,625
Maybe.

265
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:53,988
- And you must have me?
- Yes. Something like that.

266
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:57,133
- Just like that?
- Yes, why not?

267
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,260
But I still have the choice?

268
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,169
Of course.

269
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,099
Then the answer's still no.

270
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:06,909
No, I don't believe you.

271
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:11,004
- That's why you had me brought here?
- Would you have come on your own?

272
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:13,740
Well, there it is. I was right.

273
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,620
You can have any woman in the city.

274
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:21,619
What do you really want?

275
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:28,891
Why show me?

276
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,589
Because I'm going to run.

277
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:33,197
Why tell me?

278
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:35,064
You know something.

279
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,742
About running? Dying, what?

280
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,880
Both. But running is
what I'm interested in.

281
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:46,311
I know what everyone knows.

282
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:50,009
Try like hell for renewal. You have the
same chance as anyone else. Carrousel.

283
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,917
Look, don't you understand? It's
different now because it's me!

284
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:55,419
My life.

285
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:58,392
Help me.

286
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:01,593
How can I?

287
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:07,894
Where'd you get that?

288
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,403
I got it from a runner.

289
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,199
And then you killed him.

290
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:14,069
It was my job.

291
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:15,539
But now...

292
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,446
...it's different.

293
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:18,944
Believe me.

294
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:21,509
I don't.

295
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:23,950
Speak to your friends for me.

296
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:25,546
What friends?

297
00:30:25,755 --> 00:30:27,347
Look, I don't have much time!

298
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:29,917
I never heard of a
Sandman running, ever.

299
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:33,720
And I never heard of Sanctuary.

300
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:15,937
First level, near the hand.

301
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,908
Don't look for us, we'll see you.

302
00:31:20,676 --> 00:31:23,144
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.

303
00:31:23,412 --> 00:31:24,436
Can you do it?

304
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,177
Will you?

305
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,982
Tonight?

306
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:31,518
Yes.

307
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:33,922
I'm sorry, Jessica.

308
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:35,646
We all are.

309
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:38,716
But he has heard about Sanctuary.

310
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:41,953
And that makes him
dangerous to all of us.

311
00:31:42,864 --> 00:31:44,296
Doesn't it?

312
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:54,007
Oh, thanks, Francis. I can use a break.

313
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:56,608
Just don't take forever, like last time.

314
00:31:56,812 --> 00:32:00,407
You love it. You're afraid
you'll miss a really good run.

315
00:32:22,204 --> 00:32:23,228
You spoke to them?

316
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:25,838
Them?

317
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:30,244
Why are you here?

318
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:34,809
I'm here to help you.

319
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,051
Come with me to Arcade.

320
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:05,204
Wait, Logan.

321
00:33:06,747 --> 00:33:07,577
We have to talk.

322
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:09,208
Yes, we have to.

323
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:13,250
What is it?

324
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,579
A runner. In Cathedral.

325
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:17,950
A woman. Come on.

326
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:25,959
You better go home.

327
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,135
I'd rather be with you.

328
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:32,503
Logan's got a mean one tonight.

329
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:34,732
- Cathedral. I better help him.
- Watch out.

330
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:37,409
Careful, they'll cut you to
pieces before you see them.

331
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:03,163
Are the cubs really as wild as they say?

332
00:34:04,404 --> 00:34:05,769
Never been there, have you?

333
00:34:05,972 --> 00:34:07,496
No, of course not.

334
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:11,506
You wanted to come with
me. You'll find out.

335
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:14,741
They're wild, all right.

336
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:18,276
They're the violent ones. There's no
place else for them, unless they change.

337
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,879
People say it's because
they're born in breeders.

338
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:24,146
Had you heard that?

339
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:26,650
We're all born in breeders.

340
00:34:26,892 --> 00:34:29,986
But most of us don't end up
running wild in Cathedral.

341
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:34,133
No, but they say human
mothering might be better.

342
00:34:36,836 --> 00:34:38,667
I wish I'd known my mother.

343
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,876
Where do you get these crazy ideas?

344
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,776
When did you begin to question Last Day?

345
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,043
I didn't say I questioned it.

346
00:34:53,318 --> 00:34:54,182
Do you?

347
00:34:56,588 --> 00:34:58,783
Entering a reservation
for violent delinquents.

348
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:01,457
Authorized persons only.

349
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:23,171
I've never been in this quadrant before.

350
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:29,618
Request door open, Cathedral Plaza.

351
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:32,085
Logan 5 authorized to enter risk area.

352
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,155
They shut it to keep in the cubs.

353
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:39,760
Let me go first.

354
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:43,865
Sometimes they're
waiting just inside there.

355
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:48,062
Quick, before it closes.

356
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:23,205
Don't be afraid.

357
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:27,067
What's your name?

358
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:29,076
Mary 2.

359
00:36:30,414 --> 00:36:31,381
Where do you live?

360
00:36:31,582 --> 00:36:32,844
Here.

361
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:37,447
Why aren't you in nursery?

362
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:40,280
I'm very smart.

363
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:41,455
When are you green?

364
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:43,459
When do you go up?

365
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:47,220
I never go upstairs.

366
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,729
You're a nice old lady.

367
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:56,499
No, don't.

368
00:36:56,707 --> 00:36:58,299
Might be a decoy.

369
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:26,961
Runner!

370
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:41,378
Watch out!

371
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:46,118
Circle! Circle!

372
00:37:46,355 --> 00:37:47,788
Get behind them.

373
00:37:48,524 --> 00:37:49,753
Don't let them get away.

374
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:51,653
Billy, come on!

375
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:53,829
Billy, we've got one!

376
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:57,223
We've got a runner and his pair-up.

377
00:37:57,867 --> 00:37:59,459
And look who decided to run.

378
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,664
I cut up a Sandman yesterday.

379
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:05,472
They said I'd never get
him, but I cut him up good.

380
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,835
I feel sorry for you, boy.

381
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,541
For me?

382
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,812
You better feel sorry for yourself.

383
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:15,675
I feel sorry for you, Billy.

384
00:38:15,884 --> 00:38:17,181
How old are you?

385
00:38:17,386 --> 00:38:19,149
14? 15?

386
00:38:19,355 --> 00:38:22,325
Your time is running out here.
How long have you got left here?

387
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:26,585
A year, six months? What happens
when you're 16 and you go to green?

388
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,726
Nothing will happen. Nothing!
I make the rules here.

389
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,833
No cubs over 15, Billy!

390
00:38:33,135 --> 00:38:36,593
Look, have you ever seen a
cub who's turned to green?

391
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:38,332
You'll have to leave then...

392
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,940
...because they won't let you stay here.

393
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:43,943
And if you do try and stay here...

394
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:47,115
...your young friends here
will rip your guts apart!

395
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:52,917
Muscle!

396
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,788
All right, children, playtime's over.

397
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,802
How many of you want
this to be Last Day?

398
00:39:12,374 --> 00:39:13,466
Come on, we can rush him!

399
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:18,274
Come on, we can take him again!

400
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:31,317
Come on! Cut me!

401
00:40:18,473 --> 00:40:19,462
Runner?

402
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:33,946
There's been a terrible error.

403
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:37,749
My life clock must
have broken in some way.

404
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,483
I'm nowhere near 30.

405
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:41,784
I'm 22.

406
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,893
I should be green.
Did you hear me? Green!

407
00:40:45,098 --> 00:40:48,067
- Now, don't be afraid!
- Let me go! Let me go!

408
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:50,964
I am not going to hurt you.

409
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:52,604
Now, look.

410
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:53,864
There.

411
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:55,974
There. See?

412
00:40:59,012 --> 00:41:00,377
We want to help you.

413
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:08,149
Sanctuary?

414
00:41:17,097 --> 00:41:19,156
This means nothing to you?

415
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:22,927
Listen...

416
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:26,465
...if they find you, throw
this hard enough to break it.

417
00:41:26,673 --> 00:41:29,232
But remember, don't
breathe until you get away.

418
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:31,601
It's blind gas.

419
00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:49,083
Runner?

420
00:41:57,102 --> 00:41:59,434
Runner terminated at 0. 16.

421
00:41:59,638 --> 00:42:02,436
Ready for clean up,
Cathedral quadrant 39.

422
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:10,108
I must tell you now. When we were in
Arcade, I was taking you to be killed.

423
00:42:12,218 --> 00:42:14,311
I'm sorry, I didn't believe you.

424
00:42:17,389 --> 00:42:19,653
But you do now?

425
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:21,349
Of course.

426
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,993
You let the runner go.

427
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:25,060
Then tell me where Sanctuary is.

428
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:26,959
Take me to your friends.

429
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,726
I can't tell you.

430
00:42:30,169 --> 00:42:32,069
And if I take you to
them, they'll kill you.

431
00:42:32,271 --> 00:42:34,262
But you saw me let her go. Tell them.

432
00:42:34,473 --> 00:42:36,498
They won't listen. You're a Sandman.

433
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,573
They won't take the chance.

434
00:42:44,182 --> 00:42:46,549
Request maze car, Cathedral Plaza.

435
00:42:46,952 --> 00:42:48,351
Stand by to open door.

436
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:11,203
It's open.

437
00:43:11,843 --> 00:43:13,470
Come on, we got to go.

438
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:21,352
Where will you go now?

439
00:43:21,553 --> 00:43:22,849
Back to Arcade.

440
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:24,851
I'm going to get a new face.

441
00:43:25,056 --> 00:43:26,853
But you can't, you're a runner.

442
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:28,355
No one will do it.

443
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:30,584
There's New You 483.

444
00:43:30,795 --> 00:43:32,626
I think there's someone
there can help me.

445
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:34,893
Maybe there is.

446
00:43:50,247 --> 00:43:52,682
The cheeks could be
narrowed, the mouth changed...

447
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:55,651
Please let me know as soon
as you've made your selection.

448
00:43:57,288 --> 00:43:59,756
I'll let you know as
soon as she's decided.

449
00:44:03,962 --> 00:44:05,862
Hello, Sandman.

450
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:08,387
We don't get many Sandmen.

451
00:44:08,598 --> 00:44:11,396
I think we've had only
one since I've been here.

452
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:14,297
A Sandman can get as sick
of his face as anyone else.

453
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:17,905
Doc, there's a Sandman
here. Can you see him?

454
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:22,704
Doc is ready, Sandman.

455
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:28,285
I recommend a more detailed
study of our projections.

456
00:44:28,486 --> 00:44:31,784
There are new suggestions
for your consideration...

457
00:44:35,826 --> 00:44:39,284
- This is a real privilege, Sandman.
- For me too.

458
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:44,730
I thought you'd be older.

459
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:46,766
I mean, I was expecting a red.

460
00:44:47,704 --> 00:44:48,864
I am.

461
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,104
Your own work?

462
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:53,268
Yes, I did it myself.

463
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,608
Right on there.

464
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:59,078
I'll show you.

465
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:05,948
This is the Aesculaptor Mark 3.

466
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:09,148
The latest. It's
completely self-contained.

467
00:45:11,561 --> 00:45:14,086
It has a tilt bed and
cryojectors in the platform.

468
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,962
Well, Sandman, what will it be?

469
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,502
Face job? Full-body job?

470
00:45:23,706 --> 00:45:24,832
Just the face.

471
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:26,975
Fine, Holly'll get you ready.

472
00:45:27,443 --> 00:45:29,502
You're in expert hands.

473
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,579
Believe me.

474
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:40,719
Will you get on the table, please?

475
00:45:41,957 --> 00:45:43,447
Want me to take my clothes off?

476
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,286
Not for your face.

477
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:50,799
You shouldn't have brought him here.

478
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:53,969
I didn't bring him.

479
00:45:54,804 --> 00:45:56,465
What's the difference?

480
00:45:57,239 --> 00:45:58,672
He's blinking.

481
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:01,608
He wants to run.

482
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,372
Run?

483
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:05,012
He's a Sandman.

484
00:46:08,651 --> 00:46:11,119
I tell you, he's running. I know.

485
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:12,714
Maybe.

486
00:46:13,255 --> 00:46:15,485
I just wish he'd gone somewhere else.

487
00:46:17,326 --> 00:46:18,691
All right, he gets a face.

488
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:21,120
I like dark hair.

489
00:46:21,497 --> 00:46:23,726
Tell him to give you dark hair.

490
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:26,066
All set?

491
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,896
Did you have anything special in mind?

492
00:46:29,304 --> 00:46:30,168
I don't care, just-

493
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,635
Dark hair.

494
00:46:33,641 --> 00:46:35,074
Oh, yes.

495
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,741
Holly would like dark hair.

496
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:41,242
We'll start by narrowing the cheekbones.

497
00:47:01,703 --> 00:47:04,228
With this, there's no
waiting for scar burnishing.

498
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,369
It's all in one.

499
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:07,901
Watch now.

500
00:47:10,011 --> 00:47:11,342
Here's the improvement.

501
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,849
Instant healing before you feel a thing.

502
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,818
Hello, yes?

503
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:21,620
Yes, they are.

504
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,322
Done.

505
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:33,294
Pay attention, Sandman.

506
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:35,628
I'm proud of this machine.

507
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:40,773
Perfect depth adjustment on this one.

508
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:44,433
The beam will cut through that uniform
and just through the skin beneath.

509
00:47:44,879 --> 00:47:46,312
Absolute precision.

510
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,446
Watch now.

511
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,288
Just imagine what would happen...

512
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,923
...if the healing stopped functioning.

513
00:48:03,363 --> 00:48:05,558
Doc, the machine is spinning!

514
00:48:05,766 --> 00:48:06,790
Right! It's a trap.

515
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,830
They know.

516
00:48:11,505 --> 00:48:12,699
I'm a runner!

517
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:42,559
- What's going on?
- Get out of my way! Get off me!

518
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:47,102
What are you talking about?
I saw you let a runner go.

519
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:50,134
In Cathedral.

520
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,242
I was there!

521
00:49:08,227 --> 00:49:09,159
Follow me.

522
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:10,727
Stay close.

523
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:13,632
We've got to go through the Love Shop.

524
00:49:45,297 --> 00:49:46,127
Where'd they go?

525
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:48,231
A Sandman and a green?

526
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,195
Didn't you see them?

527
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:06,728
- Why do you run from your friend?
- Because he is my friend.

528
00:52:07,104 --> 00:52:10,403
I don't want to be killed
by him, or anyone else.

529
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:12,131
He's good, isn't he?

530
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:17,012
You mean, will he find us and kill
us? Yes. Or one of the others will.

531
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:19,678
You know, they won't believe us.

532
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:23,443
Maybe not. But I'd rather take my
chance with them than with Francis.

533
00:52:23,653 --> 00:52:24,847
They won't listen.

534
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:27,182
Do you think Sandmen will?

535
00:52:29,325 --> 00:52:30,849
There's no other way for me.

536
00:52:32,628 --> 00:52:33,720
We'll convince them.

537
00:53:12,535 --> 00:53:14,002
You better stay behind me.

538
00:53:14,203 --> 00:53:15,864
How will they know we're coming?

539
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:18,034
They're watching us now.

540
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,308
They'll let us in when they're sure.

541
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:32,314
There, 17th Quadrant IK.

542
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:33,886
- Whose signal?
- Logan 5.

543
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:36,717
- Who's available?
-7, 9 and Arcade Patrol.

544
00:53:36,992 --> 00:53:40,450
Sandman, put your hands on your head.

545
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:44,130
Clasp your fingers together.

546
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:47,166
Now turn your hands over. Palms up.

547
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:51,298
In a moment, a light
will shine in your eyes.

548
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:55,306
Walk into it. Jessica
first. Then you, Sandman.

549
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,502
You will have to stoop, but
don't unclasp your hands.

550
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:00,203
Do you agree?

551
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:15,019
Move against the pillar.

552
00:54:15,696 --> 00:54:17,130
Up against it!

553
00:54:24,272 --> 00:54:25,864
Look, I'm a runner.

554
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:30,105
She brought me here because
I begged her to help me.

555
00:54:32,414 --> 00:54:35,941
- He's lying.
- No Sandman ever ran.

556
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:37,845
You don't run.

557
00:54:38,052 --> 00:54:39,041
You kill runners.

558
00:54:39,253 --> 00:54:40,982
You have always killed runners.

559
00:54:41,188 --> 00:54:42,883
Yes, I have.

560
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,219
But now it's my turn.

561
00:54:45,859 --> 00:54:47,520
And I find I want to live.

562
00:54:47,962 --> 00:54:49,328
What's the matter with you?

563
00:54:49,631 --> 00:54:52,327
He's a runner! He's blinking!

564
00:54:52,867 --> 00:54:55,734
We must help anyone who asks. We must!

565
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:59,540
Or we're the same as they are,
deciding who lives or dies!

566
00:55:08,382 --> 00:55:11,215
Holly. Holly New You 483.

567
00:55:11,418 --> 00:55:12,817
He's dead. Doc is dead.

568
00:55:13,153 --> 00:55:14,643
And the Sandman came.

569
00:55:16,457 --> 00:55:17,446
It's him!

570
00:55:17,658 --> 00:55:18,556
He killed Doc.

571
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,118
Wait!

572
00:55:21,997 --> 00:55:23,623
He's running.

573
00:55:24,131 --> 00:55:25,155
Tell them the rest!

574
00:55:25,399 --> 00:55:26,661
He's the one.

575
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:28,630
And you, too. I remember.

576
00:55:28,836 --> 00:55:30,269
He was in a hurry.

577
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:31,768
A face job only.

578
00:55:31,972 --> 00:55:34,372
And I said, dark hair.

579
00:55:34,575 --> 00:55:36,236
And then he killed Doc...

580
00:55:36,443 --> 00:55:39,173
...and you grabbed me and
the machine blew up and I ran.

581
00:55:39,613 --> 00:55:40,443
I ran.

582
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:43,939
Holly, please!

583
00:55:44,785 --> 00:55:46,718
The other Sandman.

584
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,052
Remember?

585
00:55:49,422 --> 00:55:51,253
The one who came after?

586
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:01,090
That's right.

587
00:56:02,036 --> 00:56:03,628
The other one came after.

588
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:08,372
And he was hunting the
first one, wasn't he?

589
00:56:09,308 --> 00:56:10,605
Wasn't he?

590
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,135
This one was running...

591
00:56:13,346 --> 00:56:16,713
...and the other one was
hunting him, remember?

592
00:56:23,724 --> 00:56:25,555
He was after you.

593
00:56:27,494 --> 00:56:29,224
I remember.

594
00:56:30,331 --> 00:56:31,627
You were running.

595
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,440
I say we pass them through.

596
00:56:51,819 --> 00:56:53,080
Runner...

597
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:55,652
...follow the corridor
with the pipes overhead.

598
00:56:56,055 --> 00:56:58,353
The way is always down.

599
00:56:58,558 --> 00:57:01,084
Then this isn't Sanctuary?

600
00:57:01,295 --> 00:57:03,456
No, you must follow the tunnel...

601
00:57:03,664 --> 00:57:04,824
...to the end.

602
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,793
Where do I go from there?

603
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:10,765
When you come to the lock,
there will be a message.

604
00:57:11,271 --> 00:57:13,796
After that, there's no turning back.

605
00:57:14,007 --> 00:57:16,804
No. Jessica goes back now.

606
00:57:18,044 --> 00:57:19,011
Do you hear me?

607
00:57:19,212 --> 00:57:20,270
You must go back now.

608
00:57:22,415 --> 00:57:23,882
No, I'm going with you.

609
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:27,720
No, it's not possible.
No, you must go back.

610
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,612
Somebody take her back.

611
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,790
See that she gets out of here.

612
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:34,553
Please...

613
00:57:34,762 --> 00:57:35,786
...it's dangerous.

614
00:57:36,396 --> 00:57:37,863
I don't care.

615
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:40,831
I want to go to Sanctuary.

616
00:57:41,033 --> 00:57:42,159
Take me with you?

617
00:57:43,236 --> 00:57:45,932
Jessica, why?

618
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:48,369
You're still a green.
You're not running.

619
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:51,543
It doesn't matter what I am.

620
00:57:51,978 --> 00:57:53,468
I want to be with you.

621
00:58:39,492 --> 00:58:40,959
Listen to me!

622
00:58:42,128 --> 00:58:45,995
I'm your friend. I understand.
We all go crazy once in a while.

623
00:58:46,932 --> 00:58:50,561
Nobody knows except me. I won't tell.
I could have turned you in. I didn't.

624
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,294
But she's a runner.

625
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,102
And it's over.

626
00:58:56,942 --> 00:58:59,775
Terminate her! Now!

627
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:03,276
You're a Sandman! Now, Logan. Now!

628
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:04,816
Stay out of it!

629
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:40,510
What do we do now?

630
00:59:42,152 --> 00:59:44,347
Runner, this is the last gate.

631
00:59:44,555 --> 00:59:45,989
Use your key now.

632
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:49,319
When the bell sounds
again, use your key.

633
00:59:49,527 --> 00:59:52,462
Good luck, runner.
May you find Sanctuary.

634
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:07,836
I still have the key
I took from the runner.

635
01:00:08,112 --> 01:00:09,044
There.

636
01:00:57,928 --> 01:00:59,953
We must be somewhere under the city.

637
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,723
I'd always heard the city
received its power from the sea...

638
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:05,491
...but this looks forgotten.

639
01:01:05,702 --> 01:01:07,226
Unused.

640
01:01:29,726 --> 01:01:31,819
Runner, this is the last gate.

641
01:01:32,028 --> 01:01:33,461
Use your key now.

642
01:01:33,663 --> 01:01:34,857
When the bell sounds...

643
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,435
What do you suppose this was?

644
01:01:46,141 --> 01:01:48,507
Looks like some sort of breeding pen.

645
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:51,979
They say people used to
breed animals, fish, anything.

646
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:54,913
To eat, you know?

647
01:01:55,617 --> 01:01:57,882
Must have been a savage world.

648
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:19,062
He said go down.

649
01:06:22,681 --> 01:06:24,546
Maybe we can put these around us.

650
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,742
Let's take our clothes off
first, before they freeze on us.

651
01:06:56,548 --> 01:06:57,742
Welcome, humans.

652
01:06:59,151 --> 01:07:01,449
I am ready for you.

653
01:07:02,053 --> 01:07:04,248
Fish, plankton...

654
01:07:04,455 --> 01:07:07,583
...sea greens and protein from the sea.

655
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:10,389
Fresh as harvest day.

656
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:15,689
Overwhelming, am I not?

657
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,891
Are you, too, startled?

658
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:21,265
Am I too removed from your ken?

659
01:07:21,472 --> 01:07:22,734
What...?

660
01:07:23,307 --> 01:07:24,432
Who are you?

661
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:27,002
I'm more than machine...

662
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:28,644
...or man.

663
01:07:28,846 --> 01:07:31,940
More than a fusion of the two.

664
01:07:32,483 --> 01:07:34,144
Don't you agree?

665
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:39,788
Wait for the winds.

666
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:42,686
Then, my birds...

667
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:44,190
...sing...

668
01:07:44,395 --> 01:07:48,160
...and the deep
grottoes whisper my name.

669
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,598
Box!

670
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:52,626
Box!

671
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:54,997
Box!

672
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,737
This place is a link
to Sanctuary, isn't it?

673
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:01,567
Link?

674
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,845
How do you think we got here?

675
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,075
Same as the others.

676
01:08:06,283 --> 01:08:07,511
Don't you remember?

677
01:08:07,718 --> 01:08:09,344
Why do you think we're here?

678
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,318
Why?

679
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:12,488
Why?

680
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,017
We were sent here. And you know it.

681
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:20,492
You say others have been
sent here. Where are they?

682
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:22,262
In hiding?

683
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:24,523
Hiding?

684
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,793
Yes.

685
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,365
Hiding.

686
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,901
You know about Sanctuary.

687
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,199
I know you do.

688
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:34,969
- Sanctuary?
- You have to help us.

689
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:38,572
You don't have a choice!
It's not your decision!

690
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,044
So tell us!

691
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:41,407
Very well.

692
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,245
Follow me.

693
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,386
This way.

694
01:09:08,278 --> 01:09:09,438
How'd they get there?

695
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,443
Regular storage procedure.

696
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:13,445
The same as the other food.

697
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,141
The other food stopped
coming, and they started.

698
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,011
What other food?

699
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:24,322
Fish and plankton and sea greens...

700
01:09:24,526 --> 01:09:26,426
...and protein from the sea.

701
01:09:26,628 --> 01:09:27,959
It's all here.

702
01:09:28,263 --> 01:09:29,230
Ready.

703
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:31,797
Fresh as harvest day.

704
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,332
Fish and plankton.

705
01:09:34,536 --> 01:09:37,597
Sea greens and protein from the sea.

706
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:39,865
And then it stopped coming...

707
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,872
...and they came instead.

708
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,375
So I store them here.

709
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:46,574
I'm ready...

710
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:48,340
...and you're ready.

711
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,619
It's my job...

712
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,381
...to freeze you!

713
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,079
Protein...

714
01:09:55,757 --> 01:09:58,692
...plankton, grass from the sea!

715
01:10:14,776 --> 01:10:16,038
My birds!

716
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,912
My birds!

717
01:11:06,961 --> 01:11:08,292
What is it?

718
01:11:09,629 --> 01:11:11,028
I don't know.

719
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,960
Whatever it is...

720
01:11:15,168 --> 01:11:16,534
...it's warm.

721
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:24,469
We must be outside.

722
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:57,000
I didn't know any place
could be like this.

723
01:12:58,938 --> 01:13:00,667
Everything hurts.

724
01:13:08,647 --> 01:13:10,012
I hate outside!

725
01:13:10,215 --> 01:13:12,615
- I hate it! I hate it!
- Jessica!

726
01:13:12,818 --> 01:13:15,912
It's all right. Come on, it's all right!

727
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:18,623
We'll be all right. Don't worry.

728
01:13:20,225 --> 01:13:21,624
We'll get there.

729
01:13:23,462 --> 01:13:25,224
Just got to find some water.

730
01:13:37,576 --> 01:13:38,975
It's dark...

731
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:40,611
...and cold.

732
01:13:41,413 --> 01:13:43,142
And I'm tired.

733
01:13:43,415 --> 01:13:45,679
Come on. We must get out of here.

734
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:47,078
Sorry.

735
01:13:47,652 --> 01:13:49,847
I can't go any further.

736
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:56,257
Let's rest in here.

737
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,080
Do you think everything
will turn to ice?

738
01:14:19,217 --> 01:14:20,650
I doubt it.

739
01:14:24,555 --> 01:14:26,250
Don't ever let go.

740
01:14:28,292 --> 01:14:29,589
I won't.

741
01:14:35,566 --> 01:14:37,659
It all seemed to make sense...

742
01:14:38,336 --> 01:14:39,963
...until Box.

743
01:14:41,973 --> 01:14:43,941
You think he was telling the truth?

744
01:14:44,742 --> 01:14:46,437
What truth?

745
01:14:48,146 --> 01:14:50,706
Perhaps we're the first
people to get through.

746
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:56,083
Maybe Sanctuary isn't far now.

747
01:14:57,854 --> 01:14:59,913
Another protected place.

748
01:15:01,024 --> 01:15:02,753
Can't be outside.

749
01:15:02,959 --> 01:15:04,654
Who would ever know?

750
01:15:05,529 --> 01:15:07,464
And even if we find it...

751
01:15:07,965 --> 01:15:09,899
...we can't go back now.

752
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:18,407
No, you're right.

753
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:20,269
It must be near now.

754
01:15:22,179 --> 01:15:23,612
We'll find it.

755
01:15:28,552 --> 01:15:29,519
Look!

756
01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:31,050
Logan, look!

757
01:15:31,254 --> 01:15:32,152
Water!

758
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,960
Look.

759
01:16:18,535 --> 01:16:20,332
Look at your palm.

760
01:16:21,171 --> 01:16:22,138
The crystal.

761
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:23,863
It's clear.

762
01:16:24,374 --> 01:16:25,965
What does it mean?

763
01:16:27,476 --> 01:16:30,343
The life clocks have no power outside.

764
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,070
We're free!

765
01:16:40,923 --> 01:16:42,322
You can have...

766
01:16:42,524 --> 01:16:44,389
...any woman in the city.

767
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,724
What do you really want?

768
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,660
You know.

769
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:53,067
The choice is still mine?

770
01:16:54,837 --> 01:16:56,202
Of course.

771
01:16:58,707 --> 01:17:00,072
This time...

772
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:02,773
...the answer's yes.

773
01:17:34,242 --> 01:17:36,142
It must be Sanctuary!

774
01:17:36,344 --> 01:17:37,811
Outside?

775
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:39,746
Exposed?

776
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:42,573
But it must be.

777
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:46,117
Whatever it is, there
are probably people there.

778
01:17:46,321 --> 01:17:47,879
And food and shelter.

779
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,589
Come on.

780
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,077
What do you suppose
happened to the people?

781
01:18:50,584 --> 01:18:53,246
I don't know. They must have left here.

782
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,415
A long time ago.

783
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:58,622
I wonder what they were like.

784
01:19:26,752 --> 01:19:28,549
That must be one of them.

785
01:19:29,455 --> 01:19:31,583
Then they looked almost like us.

786
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:33,751
Except...

787
01:19:34,795 --> 01:19:37,286
...I've never seen a
face like that before.

788
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:39,664
That must be...

789
01:19:42,035 --> 01:19:43,798
...the look of being old.

790
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:25,108
They've all got names
and numbers on them.

791
01:20:26,445 --> 01:20:28,140
I wonder what they are?

792
01:20:28,948 --> 01:20:31,473
"Beloved husband. " "Beloved wife. "

793
01:20:31,917 --> 01:20:33,850
I wonder what it means.

794
01:23:14,043 --> 01:23:15,032
Who are you?

795
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,375
Who are you?

796
01:23:22,853 --> 01:23:24,684
I'm Logan 5.

797
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:28,415
This is Jessica 6.

798
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:34,018
I never much cared for my name,
even when I could remember it.

799
01:23:36,198 --> 01:23:37,790
We're from the city.

800
01:23:42,672 --> 01:23:45,140
Yes, we came through the ice.

801
01:23:46,442 --> 01:23:48,205
We got past Box.

802
01:23:49,111 --> 01:23:50,339
Box?

803
01:23:52,281 --> 01:23:55,183
This is Sanctuary, isn't it?

804
01:23:58,154 --> 01:23:59,781
Sanctuary?

805
01:24:04,527 --> 01:24:06,688
May I see your hand?

806
01:24:22,644 --> 01:24:24,134
Look at his face.

807
01:24:24,346 --> 01:24:25,871
His hair.

808
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:30,846
- Is that what it is to grow old?
- I guess so, yes.

809
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,111
But how old are you?

810
01:24:33,322 --> 01:24:35,517
I don't know. I'm as old...

811
01:24:35,725 --> 01:24:37,920
...as I am, I suppose.

812
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:41,787
Your hair is white.

813
01:24:41,996 --> 01:24:44,464
Yes, well, it wasn't
always that color, you know.

814
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:47,226
I got my color someplace here.

815
01:24:47,435 --> 01:24:51,098
It wasn't your color. It
wasn't much like hers, either.

816
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,804
Those cracks in your face...

817
01:24:55,009 --> 01:24:55,998
...do they hurt?

818
01:24:59,982 --> 01:25:01,415
Can I touch them?

819
01:25:01,951 --> 01:25:03,350
Oh, my.

820
01:25:03,685 --> 01:25:04,879
Try.

821
01:25:23,371 --> 01:25:24,702
Are you alone here?

822
01:25:25,774 --> 01:25:27,536
Hardly.

823
01:25:32,213 --> 01:25:34,340
I got all these cats.

824
01:25:37,385 --> 01:25:40,218
Is that what they're called? Cats?

825
01:25:40,488 --> 01:25:42,319
And they've each got their own name.

826
01:25:42,524 --> 01:25:45,357
Cats, of course, what
else would they be called?

827
01:25:45,727 --> 01:25:46,819
Cats!

828
01:25:48,463 --> 01:25:50,453
You know they've each got three names?

829
01:25:52,132 --> 01:25:54,498
The naming of cats
is a difficult matter.

830
01:25:54,701 --> 01:25:57,499
It's not just one of your holiday games.

831
01:25:57,704 --> 01:25:59,569
You may think at first
I'm mad as a hatter...

832
01:25:59,773 --> 01:26:04,301
...when I tell you that each
cat's got three different names.

833
01:26:04,946 --> 01:26:06,573
See, they got their ordinary name...

834
01:26:06,915 --> 01:26:09,782
...and then they got their fancy name.

835
01:26:10,485 --> 01:26:12,714
And that makes two names, doesn't it?

836
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:14,819
Now it's got a third name.

837
01:26:15,022 --> 01:26:18,321
Can either of you two guess
what that third name is?

838
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:20,984
Come on!

839
01:26:25,632 --> 01:26:27,566
Above and beyond...

840
01:26:27,768 --> 01:26:29,463
...there's one name that's left over...

841
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:32,969
...and this is the name
you never will guess.

842
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:37,003
The name no human
research can discover...

843
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:39,509
...but the cat itself knows...

844
01:26:39,713 --> 01:26:41,271
...and never will confess.

845
01:26:41,482 --> 01:26:43,006
Will you, Henry?

846
01:26:45,519 --> 01:26:47,248
How long have you been living here?

847
01:26:48,355 --> 01:26:50,755
A little longer than I can remember.

848
01:26:53,026 --> 01:26:54,994
What kind of a place is this?

849
01:26:56,429 --> 01:26:57,657
Well, it's...

850
01:26:57,864 --> 01:27:00,196
...just a place, you know. Just a place.

851
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:03,066
How'd you get here?

852
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,294
I've always been here. Hello, Thomas.

853
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,737
Are there other people?

854
01:27:09,876 --> 01:27:11,310
Oh, gracious, no.

855
01:27:11,512 --> 01:27:14,106
Has anyone else ever
passed through here?

856
01:27:14,314 --> 01:27:17,511
There may be a few out
there. I don't know.

857
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:20,149
What makes you think that?

858
01:27:21,287 --> 01:27:22,914
My parents told me.

859
01:27:23,122 --> 01:27:24,453
My mother...

860
01:27:29,629 --> 01:27:30,755
...and my father.

861
01:27:31,731 --> 01:27:33,892
You knew your mother and father?

862
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,234
Sure, they raised me.

863
01:27:38,738 --> 01:27:40,262
How were you grown?

864
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,433
Inside your mother?

865
01:27:43,209 --> 01:27:44,642
Right in there.

866
01:27:45,378 --> 01:27:46,572
Are you sure?

867
01:27:47,013 --> 01:27:49,140
That's what she told me.

868
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:52,112
I have to believe her. I don't know.

869
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,174
Where are they?

870
01:27:54,554 --> 01:27:55,418
What was that?

871
01:27:55,988 --> 01:27:57,285
Where are they now?

872
01:27:57,523 --> 01:27:58,683
Where?

873
01:27:58,891 --> 01:28:00,381
They're dead.

874
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:02,891
They are dead. Yeah.

875
01:28:03,095 --> 01:28:04,322
Buried.

876
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,462
Buried?

877
01:28:07,799 --> 01:28:09,130
They're buried.

878
01:28:16,742 --> 01:28:18,539
Gus was the cat at the theater door.

879
01:28:18,744 --> 01:28:23,147
His name, and I should have told
you before, is really Asparagus.

880
01:28:23,349 --> 01:28:25,340
But that's such a fuss to pronounce.

881
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:28,678
...we call him just Gus.

882
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:34,650
Why did you want to see my hand before?

883
01:28:36,094 --> 01:28:37,857
You'd better show me yours.

884
01:28:38,964 --> 01:28:40,556
Yes, you had.

885
01:28:44,469 --> 01:28:45,936
That's lovely.

886
01:28:46,137 --> 01:28:47,661
That's beautiful.

887
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,901
Can I have one of these?

888
01:28:54,346 --> 01:28:57,008
I'm sorry. It's not possible.

889
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:00,909
That's just not fair.

890
01:29:01,386 --> 01:29:02,444
Hello.

891
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,252
I'll give you one of my
best cats, my favorite.

892
01:29:06,725 --> 01:29:08,693
I'll give you a Jellicle cat. I will.

893
01:29:09,894 --> 01:29:13,226
I'm sorry, I really don't
have anything to give you.

894
01:29:13,664 --> 01:29:15,393
That's the truth.

895
01:29:16,266 --> 01:29:17,460
You hear that?

896
01:29:17,668 --> 01:29:20,330
Here, you can have this.

897
01:29:21,873 --> 01:29:23,773
What is that treasure?

898
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:25,567
I don't know.

899
01:29:27,979 --> 01:29:31,039
You don't know. You're
full of secrets as Macavity.

900
01:29:31,416 --> 01:29:34,384
Macavity, Macavity. There's
no one like Macavity.

901
01:29:34,585 --> 01:29:38,749
There never was a cat of such
deceitfulness and suavity.

902
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:44,086
What lies beyond this
place? Do you know?

903
01:29:44,328 --> 01:29:45,761
Welleverity.

904
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:50,700
I don't know, nothing. Nothing there.

905
01:29:50,901 --> 01:29:54,200
Did your father or mother
ever mention another place?

906
01:29:54,738 --> 01:29:57,536
My mother? No, she never
mentioned any other.

907
01:29:57,741 --> 01:29:59,333
Nothing at all.

908
01:30:03,514 --> 01:30:05,379
May we stay here?

909
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,777
We'd like to rest awhile.

910
01:30:08,218 --> 01:30:10,243
Of course. This belongs to the people.

911
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:16,657
- What belongs to the people?
- Certainly does. All of it.

912
01:30:19,429 --> 01:30:20,623
What people?

913
01:30:20,797 --> 01:30:23,357
All of them. It's marked
on the wall someplace.

914
01:30:23,566 --> 01:30:24,999
All the people, all the time...

915
01:30:25,201 --> 01:30:26,668
...shall not...

916
01:30:28,472 --> 01:30:29,996
I'll be right back.

917
01:30:34,178 --> 01:30:36,476
That sweet madman.

918
01:30:37,614 --> 01:30:39,878
How could he come to exist?

919
01:30:40,751 --> 01:30:43,048
He had a mother and a father.

920
01:30:43,352 --> 01:30:46,378
And they spent their lives together.

921
01:30:48,357 --> 01:30:50,484
One in a million, I suppose.

922
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,459
Who knows?

923
01:30:58,668 --> 01:31:00,728
We are going on, aren't we?

924
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,366
There's nothing to go on to.

925
01:31:05,475 --> 01:31:07,102
There's Sanctuary.

926
01:31:07,310 --> 01:31:08,299
There is.

927
01:31:09,512 --> 01:31:10,945
You want there to be one, but-

928
01:31:11,147 --> 01:31:12,705
There has to be!

929
01:31:13,082 --> 01:31:14,413
I know it exists.

930
01:31:14,617 --> 01:31:17,643
- It has to.
- No, it does not. Not really.

931
01:31:18,321 --> 01:31:22,018
Just so many people want it to exist,
so many people who don't want to die...

932
01:31:22,225 --> 01:31:26,161
...they want it so much that a
place called Sanctuary becomes real.

933
01:31:26,362 --> 01:31:29,888
But it doesn't exist. It never existed.

934
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:32,188
Just the hope.

935
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,698
You're wrong!

936
01:31:33,903 --> 01:31:36,463
- It has to be! It has to be!
- Oh, Jessica.

937
01:31:40,143 --> 01:31:41,371
Oh, my.

938
01:31:41,577 --> 01:31:43,408
Don't cry.

939
01:31:46,215 --> 01:31:50,207
Look, I got some bigger ones of these
over there. I don't know who they all are.

940
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:52,716
I think they must be family.

941
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:54,718
That'll cheer you up.

942
01:31:54,923 --> 01:31:57,414
That's my color. That's what it is.

943
01:31:57,626 --> 01:31:59,719
Leave her alone.

944
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:17,105
Surprised you, Doris, didn't he?

945
01:32:17,746 --> 01:32:19,907
Now, I don't know who these all are.

946
01:32:20,115 --> 01:32:22,982
I'm quite used to them. They
all look the same to me now.

947
01:32:23,185 --> 01:32:26,916
When I first found them,
they were a little different.

948
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:33,353
You know, feel free to look at them.

949
01:32:33,562 --> 01:32:36,530
But they're all old men.

950
01:32:37,798 --> 01:32:41,200
Father said that one of these people...

951
01:32:41,403 --> 01:32:44,167
...never told a lie. I
don't know which one it is.

952
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:50,674
You thought I wouldn't
find you, didn't you?

953
01:32:51,146 --> 01:32:53,171
You thought I'd quit, huh?

954
01:32:54,282 --> 01:32:55,977
What did you do to him?

955
01:32:56,917 --> 01:32:59,715
You know what he was? He was a Sandman.

956
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,512
He was happy.

957
01:33:02,122 --> 01:33:05,057
You ruined him. You killed him.

958
01:33:07,261 --> 01:33:08,523
Wait.

959
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:11,821
I've seen this face before.

960
01:33:13,268 --> 01:33:14,394
Yes, isn't he the...

961
01:33:41,061 --> 01:33:42,425
Logan!

962
01:33:53,974 --> 01:33:54,838
Why, Logan?

963
01:33:55,876 --> 01:33:56,968
Why?

964
01:33:58,045 --> 01:34:00,411
Is this good? Is this what you want?

965
01:34:04,184 --> 01:34:06,014
We had good times.

966
01:34:07,887 --> 01:34:08,854
I let you go.

967
01:34:09,789 --> 01:34:11,381
You wouldn't terminate a runner...

968
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:13,491
...and I covered for you!

969
01:34:14,494 --> 01:34:16,155
Why did you let her?

970
01:34:17,063 --> 01:34:19,225
And now, I have to finish you.

971
01:34:20,768 --> 01:34:23,168
You are terminated, runner.

972
01:34:23,737 --> 01:34:25,796
Francis, look at your palm.

973
01:34:26,173 --> 01:34:28,072
Go on. Look at it.

974
01:34:29,342 --> 01:34:30,969
Go on, look at it!

975
01:34:35,615 --> 01:34:37,674
Believe me, it's true.

976
01:34:38,351 --> 01:34:39,943
This isn't the truth.

977
01:34:40,153 --> 01:34:41,848
This is a lie!

978
01:35:00,273 --> 01:35:02,366
Francis, stop! Listen!

979
01:36:49,613 --> 01:36:51,979
That was the right shot.

980
01:36:53,717 --> 01:36:55,548
Watch out, now.

981
01:36:56,187 --> 01:36:57,779
He's tricky.

982
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:00,748
He'll fool you.

983
01:37:15,473 --> 01:37:17,031
You renewed.

984
01:38:01,484 --> 01:38:03,645
I don't want to say anymore...

985
01:38:03,853 --> 01:38:07,482
...but I hope that is
understood, young woman.

986
01:38:07,690 --> 01:38:09,124
Of course.

987
01:38:09,593 --> 01:38:11,891
Now don't forget...

988
01:38:12,229 --> 01:38:14,162
...you promised.

989
01:38:14,364 --> 01:38:15,422
We'll remember.

990
01:38:15,632 --> 01:38:17,793
But that's a long time off.

991
01:38:18,401 --> 01:38:20,062
I wish I knew, but...

992
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:22,067
Long time off.

993
01:38:27,877 --> 01:38:29,504
What are we promising him?

994
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:34,405
He asked if we would bury
him when his time comes.

995
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:36,516
We can't.

996
01:38:39,821 --> 01:38:41,380
We're going back.

997
01:38:41,591 --> 01:38:42,888
Back?

998
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:44,592
To what?

999
01:38:44,794 --> 01:38:46,523
I have to tell them the truth.

1000
01:38:46,729 --> 01:38:49,926
You won't be able to
tell anybody anything.

1001
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:51,623
You'll be killed.

1002
01:38:51,834 --> 01:38:53,461
Not when they've learned of this.

1003
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:55,035
They won't listen.

1004
01:38:55,238 --> 01:38:57,297
Things don't change.

1005
01:38:58,607 --> 01:39:01,701
We can stay here together.

1006
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:04,003
Have a life as long as his together.

1007
01:39:04,213 --> 01:39:06,647
Jessica, things do change. Look.

1008
01:39:06,848 --> 01:39:09,373
You're lying. You don't
want to change anything.

1009
01:39:09,585 --> 01:39:11,212
You want to go back to kill!

1010
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:13,047
- Listen to me.
- Francis was right!

1011
01:39:13,255 --> 01:39:16,521
- You really- -
Look. Listen to me.

1012
01:39:17,961 --> 01:39:20,758
The life clocks made me kill Francis.

1013
01:39:21,163 --> 01:39:23,996
They kill people every single day.

1014
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:28,101
If I don't go back
and try to stop that...

1015
01:39:28,303 --> 01:39:30,396
...destroy them...

1016
01:39:30,606 --> 01:39:32,369
...I can't live here.

1017
01:39:32,574 --> 01:39:34,371
I couldn't live anywhere.

1018
01:39:35,344 --> 01:39:37,574
Don't you understand that?

1019
01:39:37,779 --> 01:39:39,246
All I want...

1020
01:39:39,448 --> 01:39:42,349
...is to be alive and with you.

1021
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:44,177
That's all.

1022
01:39:45,253 --> 01:39:47,916
Do you think I want
anything different now?

1023
01:39:57,899 --> 01:39:59,799
Must we leave soon?

1024
01:40:01,403 --> 01:40:03,337
As soon as it gets light.

1025
01:40:15,016 --> 01:40:18,315
We're going to have to
leave you in the morning.

1026
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:24,354
What kind of people are you?

1027
01:40:24,926 --> 01:40:28,520
She promised you'd stay
here and bury me! You did!

1028
01:40:28,729 --> 01:40:30,287
Come with us.

1029
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,595
Yes. Come with us.

1030
01:40:34,802 --> 01:40:36,463
Yes, you must.

1031
01:40:36,671 --> 01:40:37,899
We need you now.

1032
01:40:38,105 --> 01:40:41,541
If people see you, then
they must believe us.

1033
01:40:43,077 --> 01:40:44,772
Where you going?

1034
01:40:45,446 --> 01:40:49,678
We're going to a city with
thousands and thousands of people.

1035
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:51,043
Young people.

1036
01:40:51,251 --> 01:40:53,777
All the people, all the time.

1037
01:40:53,988 --> 01:40:55,250
Five million.

1038
01:40:55,456 --> 01:40:57,014
How many...?

1039
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,626
Is that more than my cats?

1040
01:40:59,827 --> 01:41:01,055
More.

1041
01:41:01,262 --> 01:41:02,456
Much, much more.

1042
01:41:02,663 --> 01:41:06,360
More than...? Oh, my!
And all of them alive!

1043
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:11,900
Is it a long journey?

1044
01:41:12,573 --> 01:41:14,164
It's a journey.

1045
01:41:18,411 --> 01:41:21,107
We lived in most of these houses.

1046
01:41:21,314 --> 01:41:23,612
But they became too small for us...

1047
01:41:23,817 --> 01:41:26,514
...and ran out of mice,
I guess. I don't know.

1048
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:31,954
I used to come fishing here...

1049
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:35,286
...but somehow all the fish
died. Long time ago, now.

1050
01:41:35,495 --> 01:41:38,055
Nothing sadder than a dead fish.

1051
01:41:38,365 --> 01:41:42,358
All young people, you say?
I don't even remember what...

1052
01:41:42,569 --> 01:41:45,333
Although, of course,
the young people, yeah...

1053
01:41:47,807 --> 01:41:50,298
They say this thing
used to be called a road.

1054
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:53,138
Had to give bits of metal to use it.

1055
01:41:55,248 --> 01:41:56,545
How far away is it?

1056
01:41:57,584 --> 01:41:59,711
It's much further than it looks.

1057
01:41:59,919 --> 01:42:00,817
It's big.

1058
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:03,580
It's cold. Let's go back to the fire.

1059
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:07,089
- We'll be there soon.
- Soon?

1060
01:42:10,897 --> 01:42:13,627
That's worth its weight in gold.

1061
01:42:14,067 --> 01:42:16,900
That is, when it's cold.

1062
01:42:21,273 --> 01:42:24,071
You know, I've been thinking.

1063
01:42:24,276 --> 01:42:26,267
Those words we saw...

1064
01:42:26,478 --> 01:42:29,914
..."Beloved husband. " "Beloved wife. "

1065
01:42:30,883 --> 01:42:31,851
What do they mean?

1066
01:42:32,051 --> 01:42:33,814
Oh, well, you see...

1067
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,112
..."Beloved wife" would
mean my mother, see?

1068
01:42:37,323 --> 01:42:39,985
And "Beloved husband"
would be more like...

1069
01:42:41,461 --> 01:42:42,758
...my father.

1070
01:42:43,495 --> 01:42:47,955
- They use those words to stay together.
- Stay together?

1071
01:42:48,167 --> 01:42:50,499
- I can't put it any different.
- But you mean...

1072
01:42:50,936 --> 01:42:54,394
I mean, they lived
together all their years?

1073
01:42:56,542 --> 01:42:58,203
Before I come along, I don't know.

1074
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:00,844
But after, yeah, they did.

1075
01:43:02,114 --> 01:43:06,141
So people stayed together
for this feeling of love?

1076
01:43:06,351 --> 01:43:09,479
They would live and raise children...

1077
01:43:09,688 --> 01:43:10,985
...and be remembered?

1078
01:43:12,157 --> 01:43:15,217
They raised me, didn't
they? Right in there.

1079
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:19,898
I think I'd like that.

1080
01:43:20,098 --> 01:43:21,292
Don't you?

1081
01:43:25,037 --> 01:43:25,935
Why not?

1082
01:43:28,005 --> 01:43:29,597
Beloved husband.

1083
01:43:35,146 --> 01:43:36,238
Beloved wife.

1084
01:43:36,447 --> 01:43:38,040
Beloved son.

1085
01:43:40,152 --> 01:43:41,380
Here we go.

1086
01:43:45,524 --> 01:43:46,855
That's right.

1087
01:43:51,429 --> 01:43:54,921
You mean to say those people know
ahead of time when they'll die?

1088
01:43:55,666 --> 01:43:56,997
- That's right.
- That's silly.

1089
01:43:57,201 --> 01:43:59,226
What's the reason for that?

1090
01:43:59,637 --> 01:44:02,367
That's the way things are.
The way they've always been.

1091
01:44:02,573 --> 01:44:04,473
It takes all the fun out of dying.

1092
01:44:04,675 --> 01:44:06,870
But if they're all shut
up tight in there...

1093
01:44:07,078 --> 01:44:09,137
...how we going to get to see them?

1094
01:44:09,347 --> 01:44:11,407
All the young people?

1095
01:44:11,617 --> 01:44:12,777
What'd you say?

1096
01:44:20,458 --> 01:44:21,982
What does the water do?

1097
01:44:22,193 --> 01:44:24,127
Must be part of the power system.

1098
01:44:24,462 --> 01:44:27,295
The ocean tides are
turned into energy somehow.

1099
01:44:28,065 --> 01:44:30,795
- Does it go inside the city?
- Yes, I think so.

1100
01:44:31,002 --> 01:44:32,492
I don't know where, though.

1101
01:44:32,737 --> 01:44:35,501
Just took it for granted,
like everything else.

1102
01:44:36,172 --> 01:44:38,106
I think it's our only chance.

1103
01:44:48,953 --> 01:44:50,215
Here, let me help you!

1104
01:44:50,421 --> 01:44:53,481
No, I can look after myself.

1105
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:55,716
If ever a time comes...

1106
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:59,287
...when I can't look after
myself, I said to my cats...

1107
01:44:59,496 --> 01:45:01,828
"... Why, that's the
moment that you... "

1108
01:45:02,032 --> 01:45:03,499
Where are you?

1109
01:45:06,736 --> 01:45:08,328
I'll have to tell him.

1110
01:45:10,106 --> 01:45:12,870
We're going to try and
get in through here.

1111
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:15,543
I'm sorry...

1112
01:45:15,745 --> 01:45:17,714
...I don't think you can make it.

1113
01:45:17,915 --> 01:45:21,714
Oh, my. I was so looking forward
to seeing all those people.

1114
01:45:21,918 --> 01:45:24,079
I want you to meet them too.

1115
01:45:25,989 --> 01:45:28,958
Stay here as long as you can.

1116
01:45:29,159 --> 01:45:30,387
We'll bring them to you.

1117
01:45:30,594 --> 01:45:32,186
All the people?

1118
01:45:33,296 --> 01:45:34,695
You know...

1119
01:45:34,898 --> 01:45:36,559
...they've never seen a cat.

1120
01:45:36,866 --> 01:45:39,494
People have never seen a cat?

1121
01:45:58,722 --> 01:46:00,349
Oh, my.

1122
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:08,346
Don't go in there!

1123
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:10,674
You don't have to die!

1124
01:48:10,952 --> 01:48:13,011
No one has to die at 30!

1125
01:48:13,888 --> 01:48:15,719
You can live!

1126
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,116
Live!

1127
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,450
Live and grow old!

1128
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:23,227
I've seen it!

1129
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:24,727
She's seen it!

1130
01:48:25,766 --> 01:48:27,063
Look!

1131
01:48:27,734 --> 01:48:28,894
Look!

1132
01:48:29,102 --> 01:48:30,797
Look, it's clear!

1133
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:33,868
Last Day...

1134
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:35,967
...Capricorn 29s.

1135
01:48:36,177 --> 01:48:39,544
Year of the city 2274.

1136
01:48:40,281 --> 01:48:42,806
Carrousel begins.

1137
01:48:43,251 --> 01:48:45,548
No! Don't!

1138
01:48:46,553 --> 01:48:47,417
Don't go!

1139
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:50,184
Listen to him!

1140
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:52,850
He's telling the truth!

1141
01:48:53,827 --> 01:48:55,021
We've been outside!

1142
01:48:55,462 --> 01:48:58,329
There's another world outside!

1143
01:48:58,532 --> 01:48:59,658
We've seen it!

1144
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:02,061
The life clocks are a lie!

1145
01:49:02,269 --> 01:49:04,066
Carrousel is a lie!

1146
01:49:04,271 --> 01:49:06,603
There is no renewal!

1147
01:49:07,407 --> 01:49:09,341
Nobody's going to be renewed!

1148
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:11,272
Believe me!

1149
01:49:11,478 --> 01:49:13,070
Please listen!

1150
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:22,078
Logan 5...

1151
01:49:22,355 --> 01:49:25,085
...did you find Sanctuary?

1152
01:49:26,526 --> 01:49:29,426
Did you find Sanctuary?

1153
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:32,822
We will begin surrogation.

1154
01:49:52,251 --> 01:49:54,412
Your surrogates are engaged.

1155
01:49:59,124 --> 01:50:00,421
Logan 5...

1156
01:50:00,626 --> 01:50:04,323
...you were assigned to find
a place called Sanctuary.

1157
01:50:04,530 --> 01:50:06,020
Report.

1158
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:13,438
There is no Sanctuary.

1159
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:18,035
Unacceptable. The
answer does not program.

1160
01:50:19,411 --> 01:50:20,935
You were assigned to locate...

1161
01:50:21,146 --> 01:50:22,943
...missing runners.

1162
01:50:23,382 --> 01:50:25,509
State what you found.

1163
01:50:26,385 --> 01:50:29,582
All frozen.

1164
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:34,548
The input does not program, Logan 5.

1165
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,420
You may not resist.

1166
01:50:36,628 --> 01:50:38,994
An old...

1167
01:50:40,431 --> 01:50:41,693
...man.

1168
01:50:43,101 --> 01:50:45,366
You must not resist, Logan 5.

1169
01:50:46,071 --> 01:50:48,505
Did you find Sanctuary?

1170
01:50:48,908 --> 01:50:52,344
