1
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,663
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

2
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,963
<i>A sweep is as lucky as
lucky can be</i>

3
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,668
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

4
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,926
<i>Good luck will rub off
when he shakes hands with you</i>

5
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:14,261
<i>Chim chiminy chim chim cheree
Chim cheroo</i>

6
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,339
All right, ladies and gents.

7
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,964
Comical poems
suitable for the occasion,

8
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,763
extemporised and thought up
before your very eyes.

9
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,011
All right, here we go.

10
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,890
<i>Room here for everyone
Gather around</i>

11
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,267
The constable's responstable.

12
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,643
Now, how does that sound?

13
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,770
Hmm...

14
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,657
<i>Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you</i>

15
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,657
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park...

16
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,238
- Grrrr.
- ...with Andrew!

17
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,789
Arf! Arf!

18
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,619
- Hello, Andrew.
- An'! Arf! Grrrr! Grrrr!

19
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,915
<i>Ah, Mrs Cory</i>

20
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,999
<i>A story for you</i>

21
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,425
Your daughters were shorter than you,

22
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,049
but they grew.

23
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,187
<i>Dear Miss Persimmon...</i>

24
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,565
Yes?

25
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,190
<i>Wind's in the east</i>

26
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,902
<i>Mist comin' in</i>

27
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,609
<i>Like something is brewin'</i>

28
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,616
<i>About to begin</i>

29
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,042
<i>Can't put me finger
on what lies in store</i>

30
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,837
<i>But I feel what's to happen</i>

31
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,291
<i>All happened before</i>

32
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,376
Arf! Arf! Grrrr!

33
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,588
I'm sorry.
Where was I?

34
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,416
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.

35
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,960
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

36
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,714
Crikey.

37
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,420
Bless you, guv.

38
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,131
Generosity itself, that's what you are.

39
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,807
No charge.

40
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,263
Oh, it's you. Hello.

41
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,102
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
you say?

42
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,983
All right. Come with me.

43
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,946
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

44
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,576
Nice little spot, you might say.

45
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,578
Number 17 is just down a bit.

46
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,876
Now this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye

47
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,378
is the home of Admiral Boom,

48
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,505
late of His Majesty's navy.

49
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:21,637
Likes his house shipshape
and Bristol fashion at all times.

50
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,608
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

51
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,732
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.

52
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,903
What he's famous for is punctuality.

53
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,235
The whole world
takes its time from Greenwich,

54
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,368
but Greenwich
takes its time from Admiral Boom.

55
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,199
What cheer, Admiral?

56
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,456
Good afternoon! Where are you bound?

57
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,005
Some parties want to see number 17.

58
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,050
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.

59
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,253
Some advice, young man.

60
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,260
Storm signals are up at 17.

61
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,592
Heavy weather brewing there.

62
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,177
Thank you, sir.
I'll keep an eye skinned.

63
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,931
Here we are.

64
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,565
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
residence of George Banks, esquire.

65
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,441
Hello, hello, hello.
The admiral's right.

66
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,699
Heavy weather brewing at number 17,
and no mistake.

67
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,906
Leave her alone!

68
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,457
Don't you be trying to stop
the wretched creature!

69
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,626
Let her go and good riddance.

70
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,795
I never liked her from the moment
she set foot in the door.

71
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,842
But who'll get stuck with the children?
Me, that's who!

72
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,136
Her and her high and mighty ways.

73
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,339
And that face of her
that would stop a coal barge, it would.

74
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,547
Indeed, Mrs Brill!

75
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,633
I wouldn't stay in this house
another minute

76
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,310
for all the jewels in Christendom.

77
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,980
No, Katie Nanna, don't go!

78
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,432
Stand away from that door!

79
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,064
What'll I tell the master
about the children?

80
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,652
It's no concern of mine.

81
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,901
Those beasts ran away from me.

82
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:06,283
They must be somewhere.
Did you look around the zoo?

83
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,331
You think the lion got them?

84
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,000
They're fond of
hanging around the cage.

85
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,998
I've said my say.

86
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,876
I've done with this house forever.

87
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,673
Hip, hip, hooray!

88
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,718
Don't stumble on the way out.

89
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,262
No, no, Katie Nanna!

90
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,725
Mrs Banks. She's home.

91
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,766
<i>Our daughter's
daughters will adore us</i>

92
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,315
<i>And we'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"</i>

93
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,434
Good evening, Katie Nanna and Ellen.

94
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,690
The meeting was glorious!

95
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,024
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself
to the prime minister's carriage.

96
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,451
You should have been there!

97
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,279
And Mrs Ainslie
was carried off to prison.

98
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,498
Singing and scattering pamphlets
all the way!

99
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,543
Madam, I've always given my best...

100
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,540
Thank you, Katie Nanna.

101
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,622
I knew you were one of us.

102
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,547
<i>We're clearly soldiers in petticoats</i>

103
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,597
<i>And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes</i>

104
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,552
<i>Though we adore men individually</i>

105
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:16,231
<i>We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid</i>

106
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,307
Mrs Banks...

107
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,065
<i>Cast off the shackles of yesterday</i>

108
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,739
<i>Shoulder to shoulder into the fray</i>

109
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,284
<i>Our daughter's daughters will adore us</i>

110
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:32,580
<i>And they'll sing in grateful chorus</i>

111
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,829
<i>"Well done, Sister Suffragette"</i>

112
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,753
I don't wish to offend, but...

113
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,004
<i>From Kensington to Billingsgate
One hears the restless cries</i>

114
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,963
<i>From every corner of the land
Womankind, arise</i>

115
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,595
<i>Political equality
and equal rights with men</i>

116
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:55,270
<i>Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again</i>

117
00:09:55,345 --> 00:10:00,067
<i>No more the meek
and mild subservients we</i>

118
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:06,194
<i>We're fighting for our rights militantly</i>

119
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,740
<i>Never you fear</i>

120
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,945
If I may have a word...

121
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:15,874
<i>So cast off the shackles of yesterday</i>

122
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,453
<i>Shoulder to shoulder into the fray</i>

123
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:23,962
<i>Our daughter's daughters will adore us</i>

124
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,637
<i>And they'll sing in grateful chorus</i>

125
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,928
<i>"Well done"</i>

126
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:30,971
Mrs Banks!

127
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,095
<i>"Well done"</i>

128
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,097
Mrs Banks!

129
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,974
What is it, Katie Nanna?

130
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,478
I have something to say to you.

131
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,025
Where are the children?

132
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,230
The children, to be precise,
are not here.

133
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,780
They've disappeared again.

134
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,405
That's really careless of you.

135
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,406
That's the third time this week.

136
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,032
The fourth, madam.

137
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,490
I've had my fill.

138
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,325
I'm not one to speak
ill of the children.

139
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,376
When do you expect them home?

140
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,921
I couldn't say.
If you'd compute my wages...

141
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,126
Oh, gracious!
You're not leaving?

142
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,835
What will Mr Banks say?

143
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,343
He'll be cross
when he finds the children missing.

144
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:17,178
Put these away.
The cause infuriates Mr Banks.

145
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,897
I beseech you,
please reconsider.

146
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,349
Think of the children.

147
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,357
Think of Mr Banks.
He was just getting used to you.

148
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,069
Posts, everyone!

149
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,664
4, 3, 2, 1...

150
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,995
Fire!

151
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,891
- I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.

152
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,900
Bit early tonight, Admiral?

153
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,104
Nonsense.
Bang on the dot, as usual.

154
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,485
How's the world of finance?

155
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,690
Never better.

156
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,994
Money's sound,
credit rates are moving up,

157
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,915
- and the pound is admired everywhere.
- Good.

158
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,411
How about you?

159
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,165
Bit chancy, I'd say.

160
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,713
The Wind's up.
The glass is falling.

161
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,541
- Don't like it.
- Good. Good, good.

162
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:34,255
Banks, you're steering into

Do you hear me?

165
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,431
Hello, Katie Nanna.
That must be heavy. Allow me.

166
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,350
Hmph!

167
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,978

170

173
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,881

<i>And adequately fed</i>

187

189
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,649
Winifred, where are the children?

190
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,944
They're not here, dear.

191
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,365
Of course they're here.
Where else would they be?

192
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,943
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

193
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,747
They're missing.
Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

194
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,700
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

195
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,797
The police station. Quickly, please.

196
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,217
We needn't bother the police.
The fact is...

197
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,386
Facts cloud the issue.

198
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,557
One fact alone is clear.
Katie Nanna's faltered.

199
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,886
She's disappointed us.
I shall bring her to book...

200
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,887
Oh.

201
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,897
- She's left us, hasn't she?
- Yes, only just.

202
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,649
George Banks here.

203
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,570
17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.

204
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,077
Please send a policeman.

205
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,405
The policeman's here, George.

206
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,038
What? Oh. Very prompt.
Wonderful service.

207
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,745
Thank you so much. Good night.

208
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,001
Come in, constable.

209
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,802
While on duty across the park,
I noted some stray valuables.

210
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,299
- I believe they're yours.
- Valuables?

211
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,673
Come along now.

212
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,760
Jane.

213
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,266
Michael.

214
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,018
Winifred, don't be emotional.

215
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,398
I wouldn't be too hard on them, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.

216
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,899
Children, come here at once.

217
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,860
Well?

218
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,948
- Sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
- It was windy...

219
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,328
And the kite was too strong.

220
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:54,288
The kite ran away, sir,
not the children.

221
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,795
Thank you.
I'll manage this.

222
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,799
It wasn't a good kite.
We made it ourselves.

223
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,176
Perhaps if you helped us...

224
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,930
That's the ticket.
Kites are skittish things.

225
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,556
Only last week...

226
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,138
I'm very grateful to you, constable.

227
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,601
The cook will
find you a plate of something.

228
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,938
I shall now return to my duties.

229
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,273
Thank you, constable.

230
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:26,323
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

231
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,951
"Cook will find something."

232
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.

233
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,338
You'll want to discuss it.

234
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,711
I would, indeed.

235
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,088
Ellen, take the children upstairs.

236
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,761
Yes, sir.

237
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,848
I knew it.

238
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,553
Who bears the brunt of everything?

239
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,057
Me, that's who.

240
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,936
They don't want
an honest working girl here.

241
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,609
They need a ruddy zoo keeper.

242
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,565
Sorry.

243
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,775
When I chose Katie Nanna,
I thought she'd be firm.

244
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,905
She looked solemn, cross.

245
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,534
Never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.

246
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,365
I'll do better next time.

247
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:18,126
Next time? You've engaged six nannies.
They've all been unqualified disasters.

248
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,501
I quite agree.

249
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,379
Choosing a nanny is a delicate task,

250
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:27,760
requiring insight, balanced judgment,
and an ability to read character.

251
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,340
Under the circumstances,

252
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:34,475
it might be apropos
to select the next person myself.

253
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,851
Would you, George?

254
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,150
I'll do this properly.

255
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,068
I'll advertise in The Times.

256
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,396
- Take this down, please.
- Yes, of course.

257
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,358
Wanted... No, required...

258
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,612
Nanny.

259
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,662

Splendid, George. Inspirational.

271
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,700
- Father.
- Yes?

272
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,796
We've discussed everything,
and we're very sorry about today.

273
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,623
I should think so.

274
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,880
- It was wrong.
- Indeed.

275
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,132
We'll cooperate with the new nanny.

276

322
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,775
I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.

323
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,579
Wind's coming from a new quarter.

324
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,076
So it is.

325
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,123
- Sir.
- What?

326
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,954
Something taking place
off the port bow.

327
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,379
Ghastly looking crew, I must say.

328
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,977
There's a queue of nannies outside.
Shall I show them in'?

329
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,352
I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall be.

330
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,307
12 seconds to go.

331
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,440
- 10, 9...
- Posts!

332
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,149
7, 6, 5, 4.

333
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,575
3,2,1.

334
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,949
it is now 8:00.

335
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,207
Yes, sir.

336
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,162
I have told you repeatedly, Ellen,

337
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,872
I dislike being hurried into things.

338
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,628
I don't understand.

339
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,460
They're nothing like
what we advertised for.

340
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,718
Woof! Woof! Woof!

341
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,011
Michael, look!

342
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,689
- Perhaps it's a witch.
- Nonsense. Witches have brooms.

343
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:20,251
It's her. It's the person.
She's answered our advertisement.

344
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,428
Rosy cheeks and everything.

345
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:32,229
- Show them in, one at a time.
- Yes, sir.

346
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,066
- Come in, one at a time.
- Thank you.

347
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,741
You are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?

348
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,579
I said, you are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?

349
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,207
Yes, of course.

350
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,333
You brought your references?

351
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,586
I never give references.

352
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,667
I believe it very old-fashioned.

353
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,629
We'll see about that then.

354
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,760
Now then, the qualifications.

355
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,136
Item one, "A cheery disposition."

356
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,891
I am never cross.

357
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,938
Item two, "Rosy cheeks."

358
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,649
Obviously.

359
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,571
Item three, "Play games, all sorts."

360
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,239
They'll find my games
extremely diverting.

361
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,864
Where did you get this paper?
I tore it up.

362
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,286
Excuse me.

363
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,830
Item four, "You must be kind."

364
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,000
I am kind, but extremely firm.

365
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,328
Have you lost something?

366
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,415
That paper. I thought that I...

367
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,046
You are George Banks?

368
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,344
And you did advertise for a nanny?

369
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,842
George Banks.

370
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,968
Very well, then.

371
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:55,354
Tore it up, turned it over,
threw it in the...

372
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,473
Are you ill?

373
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,892
I hope not.

374
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,478
About my wages...

375
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,314
- The reference is obscure.
- Obscure.

376
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,116
We must be clear on that.

377
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,867
- I require every second Tuesday off.
- Every Tuesday.

378
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,873
Perhaps a trial period would be wise.

379
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,597
Hmm... I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

380
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,844
I'll see the children now.

381
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,033
Close your mouth. We are not codfish.

382
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,458
Don't stand there. Best foot forward.

383
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,911
Spit Spot.

384
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,507
- George?
- Aah!

385
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,677
I thought you were
interviewing nannies.

386
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,470
I was, I was.

387
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,048
You've selected one already?

388
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,804
Yes, it's done.

389
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,637
- Where is she?
- In the nursery.

390
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,188
- I put her to work straight-away.
- How clever.

391
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,143
I'd have muddled everything.

392
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:27,526
Is she everything
that we hoped she'd be?

393
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,654
It all happened rather quickly.
I mean, I... I, uh...

394
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,031
Will she be firm and give commands?

395
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,035
Will she mould our young breed?

396
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,201
Winifred, I think she will.

397
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,870
I think she will!

398
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:46,708
In that case, perhaps
Ellen should dismiss the others.

399
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,508
The others?

400
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,508
- Ellen!
- Yes, sir?

401
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,682
Tell the others
the position's been filled.

402
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,010
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.

403
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,940
How many nannies
does this house need?

404
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,487
The position has been filled.

405
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,787
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

406
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,116
Rather like a bear pit.

407
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,793
- That's a funny bag.
- Carpet.

408
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,166
- To carry carpets?
- No, made of.

409
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,624
Your room has a lovely view.

410
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,793
Hmm...

411
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,548
It's not exactly Buckingham Palace...

412
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,218
Still, it's clean.

413
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,521
Yes, it will be quite suitable.

414
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,315
Just needs a touch here and there.

415
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,403
First things first.

416
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:53,824
The place to hang a hat
is on a hat stand.

417
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,623
Oh!

418
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,924
This will never do.

419
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,009
I much prefer
seeing all of my face at once.

420
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,975
But there was nothing in it.

421
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:28,480
Never judge things
by their appearance, even carpetbags.

422
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,855
I never do.

423
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,778
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."

424
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,873
Hmm... A little more light perhaps.

425
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,766
We'd better watch this one.

426
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,640
- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.

427
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,392
Much better.

428
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,274
Now, let me see.

429
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,452
That's funny. I always carry it.
It must be here somewhere.

430
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,324
- What?
- My tape measure.

431
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,623
- What for?
- To see how you measure up.

432
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,757
That's the funniest thing I ever saw.

433
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,255
Ah ha ha ha. Here it is.

434
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,419
Good.

435
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,176
Come along, then. Quickly.

436
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,429
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

437
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,519
Just as I thought.
"Extremely stubborn and suspicious."

438
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,693
- I am not.
- See for yourself.

439
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,615
- "Extremely stubborn and susips..."
- Suspicious.

440
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,618
Now you, Jane.

441
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,079
"Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away."

442
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,710
How about you?

443
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,631
Very well. Hold this for me.

444
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,633
As I expected.

445
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,762
"Mary Poppins,
practically perfect in every way."

446
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,812
Mary Poppins.
Is that your name? It's lovely.

447
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,223
I've always liked it.

448
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,729
Shall we move?

449
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,188
In your advertisement,
did you not request games?

450
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,988
Yes.

451
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,409
First we'll play
"Well Begun ls Half Done."

452
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,077
That sounds suspicious.

453
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,326
Otherwise entitled,
"Let's Tidy Up The Nursery."

454
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,659
I told you she was tricky.

455
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,627
Shall we begin?

456
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,581
It is a game, isn't it?

457
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,417
Depends on your viewpoint.

458
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,597
You see, in every job that must be
clone, there is an element of fun.

459
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:07,848
You find the fun,
and snap, the job's a game.

460
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,684
<i>And every task you undertake</i>

461
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,016
<i>becomes a piece of cake</i>

462
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,443
<i>A lark, a spree</i>

463
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:20,113
<i>It's very clear to see</i>

464
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,032
<i>That</i> a

465
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,784
<i>spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

466
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,993
<i>The medicine go down
Medicine go down</i>

467
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,751
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

468
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,630
<i>In a most delightful way</i>

469
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:49,848
<i>A robin feathering his nest
has very little time to rest</i>

470
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,806
<i>While gathering
his bits of twine and twig</i>

471
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:58,520
<i>Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot</i>

472
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,855
<i>He knows a song</i>

473
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:06,489
<i>Will move the job along</i>

474
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:18,919
<i>For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

475
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:23,127
<i>The medicine go down
Medicine go down</i>

476
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:28,011
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

477
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,935
<i>In a most delightful way</i>

478
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:37,872
<i>The honeybees that fetch the nectar
from the ﬂowers to the comb</i>

479
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,501
<i>Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro</i>

480
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,881
<i>Because they take a little nip
from every ﬂower that they sip</i>

481
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,757
<i>And hence</i>

482
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,088
<i>And hence</i>

483
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,217
<i>They find</i>

484
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,423
<i>They find</i>

485
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:56,637
<i>Their task is not a grind
Their task is not a grind</i>

486
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:04,027
<i>Aaah</i>

487
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,817
Cheeky.

488
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,030
Don't be all day.

489
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,353
Let me out! Let me out!

490
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,704
Let me out!

491
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,035
Well...

492
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,493
Thank you now.

493
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,917
When you've quite finished!

494
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,172
Thank you.

495
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,678
That's quite sufficient.

496
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,223
Hats and coats, please.

497
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,016
It's time for our outing.

498
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:20,687
Let's tidy up the nursery again.

499
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,015
Enough's as good as a feast.

500
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,477
You're not as well
turned out as I'd like.

501
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,857
Still, there's time.

502
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,065
Spit Spot.

503
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,945
And off we go!

504
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,995
For a spoonful of sugar
<i>helps the medicine go down</i>

505
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,745
<i>The medicine go down
Medicine go down</i>

506
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:44,749
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

507
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:48,253
<i>In the most delightful way</i>

508
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,329
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
<i>Chim chim cheroo</i>

509
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,503
<i>I does what I likes and I likes...</i>

510
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,835
<i>What I do</i>

511
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,009
Hello, art lovers.

512
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,927
<i>Today I'm a screever</i>

513
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:38,974
<i>And as you can see
A screever's an artist</i>

514
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,095
<i>Of highest degree</i>

515
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,524
<i>And it's all me own work
from me own memory</i>

516
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:53,029
Not Royal Academy.
Still, they're not bad, are they?

517
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,200
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

518
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,246
<i>I draws what I likes
and I likes what I drew</i>

519
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,040
<i>No remuneration do I ask of you</i>

520
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,794
<i>But me cap would be glad
of a copper or two</i>

521
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:16,344
<i>Me cap would be glad
of a copper or two</i>

522
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,474
Wait!

523
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,055
Don't move.

524
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,108
Don't move a muscle.

525
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,902
Stay right where you are.

526
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,824
I'd know that silhouette anywhere.

527
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,574
- Mary Poppins!
- Hello, Bert.

528
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,909
You know Jane and Michael.

529
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,583
Well, I've seen them here and about.
Chasing a kite last time, weren't it?

530
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,832
We're going to the park.

531
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,501
To the park?

532
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,174
Not if I know Mary Poppins.

533
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,469
Other nannies go to the park.

534
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,639
When you're with Mary Poppins,

535
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,967
quick as you can say,
"Bob's your uncle,"

536
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,849
the most unusual things happen.

537
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,397
What are you talking about?

538
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,683
It's not my place to say,

539
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:16,021
but she probably has in mind
a jolly holiday.

540
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,947
Something along these lines.

541
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,404
That's always good. Here we go.

542
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,302
How about a lovely circus?
Lions and tigers.

543
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,549
World famous artistes

544
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:45,259
performing death-defying feats
of dexterity and skill.

545
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,143
Ta-da!

546
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,413
Ta-da!

547
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:16,040
Oh, that's lovely.
I'd much rather go there.

548
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:21,754
A typical English countryside
done by a loving hand.

549
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:28,060
Though you can't see it, there's
a little country fair down that road.

550
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,512
I don't see any road.

551
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,643
What? No road?

552
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,112
Just wants a bit of something here

553
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,492
and a bit of something there.

554
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,486
There.

555
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,324
A country road
suitable for travel and high adventure.

556
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,534
May we go, Mary Poppins, please?

557
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,292
Don't you think it's lovely,
Mary Poppins?

558
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,920
Now's the time. No one's looking.

559
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,626
Oh, please. Please.

560
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,009
I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself.

561
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,095
All right. I'll do it myself.

562
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,059
Do what?

563
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,477
Bit of magic.

564
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,350
- Magic?
- It's easy.

565
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,646
Let's see.

566
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,645
You think.

567
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,523
You wink.

568
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,947
You do a double blink.

569
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,113
You close your eyes and jump.

570
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,367
Is something supposed to happen?

571
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,872
Bert, what utter nonsense.

572
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:36,748
Oh.

573
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,625
Why do you complicate things?

574
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,961
Give me your hand, Michael.
Don't slouch.

575
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,761
1, 2...

576
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,983
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

577
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:10,195
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart, you do.

578
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,701
You look fine, too, Bert.

579
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,999
Isn't there a fair?

580
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:19,250
Down the road and behind the hill.

581
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,706
I hear the merry-go-round.

582
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,838
- Tell them hello.
- Don't smudge the drawing.

583
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:33,969
<i>Ain't it a glorious day
Right as a mornin' in May</i>

584
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,147
<i>I feel like I could ﬂy</i>

585
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,563
Now, Bert, none of your larking about.

586
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:45,067
Have you ever seen
the <i>grass</i> so green

587
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,446
<i>Or a bluer sky</i>

588
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:55,741
<i>Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary</i>

589
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,417
<i>Mary makes your heart so light</i>

590
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,211
You haven't changed.

591
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,211
<i>When the day is grey and ordinary</i>

592
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,419
<i>Mary makes the sun shine bright</i>

593
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,594
Oh, honestly.

594
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,515
<i>Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her</i>

595
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,478
<i>The daffodils are smiling at the dove</i>

596
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:21,808
<i>When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand</i>

597
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:26,271
<i>Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band</i>

598
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,733
You are light-headed.

599
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:34,867
<i>It's a jolly holiday with Mary</i>

600
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:38,200
<i>No wonder that it's Mary that we love</i>

601
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:57,139
<i>Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary</i>

602
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:01,223
<i>Mary makes your heart so light</i>

603
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,648
<i>When the day is grey and ordinary</i>

604
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,822
<i>Mary makes the sun shine bright</i>

605
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:14,494
<i>Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her</i>

606
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:18,415
<i>The daffodils are smiling
at the dove, oink, oink</i>

607
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:23,165
<i>When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand</i>

608
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:27,374
<i>Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band</i>

609
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:34,006
<i>It's a jolly holiday with Mary</i>

610
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,888
<i>No wonder that it's Mary that we love</i>

611
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,482
Thank you.

612
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,034
Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

613
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:28,708
<i>Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert</i>

614
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,964
<i>Gentlemen like you are few</i>

615
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,461
A vanishing breed.

616
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,967
<i>Though you're just
a diamond in the rough, Bert</i>

617
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,844
<i>Underneath your blood is blue</i>

618
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,220
Common knowledge.

619
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,476
<i>You'd never think
of pressing your advantage</i>

620
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,809
<i>Forbearance
is the hallmark of your creed</i>

621
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:55,237
<i>A lady needn't fear
when you are near</i>

622
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:59,568
<i>Your sweet gentility is crystal clear</i>

623
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,996
<i>Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert</i>

624
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:08,577
<i>A jolly, jolly holiday with you</i>

625
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,178
Waiter! Waiter?

626
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,788
Now then, what would be nice?

627
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,706
<i>We'll start with raspberry ice</i>

628
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:51,707
<i>And then some cakes and tea</i>

629
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,293
<i>Order what you will</i>

630
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,500
<i>There'll be no bill</i>

631
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,426
<i>It's complimentary</i>

632
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:00,719
You're very kind.

633
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,924
Anything for you, Mary Poppins.

634
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,849
You're our favourite person.

635
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,472
Right you are.

636
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,848
It's true that...

637
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,646
<i>Mavis and Sybil
have ways that are winning</i>

638
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,473
<i>And Prudence and Gwendolyn
set your heart spinnin'</i>

639
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,058
<i>Phoebe's delightful
Maude is disarming</i>

640
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,393
<i>Felicia, Janice and Lydia</i>

641
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,774
<i>Charming!
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet</i>

642
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,400
<i>Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat</i>

643

Nice. Very nice, indeed,

659
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,372

Mary Poppins leads by two lengths,

My horse is the fastest.

667
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,761
Hear that, mate?
Want to put up with that?

668
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,844
Is that the best you can do?

669
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,395
Hurry up, boy!

670
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,939
Not so fast, please. Michael.

671
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,102
Bert, you're just as bad.

672
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,613
Sorry. Whoa, boy. Whoa.

673
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,904
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

674
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,702
Just a bit of high spirits,
Mary Poppins.

675
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,331
Please control yourself.
We're not on a racecourse.

676
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,967
Follow me, please.

677
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,937
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. What?

678
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,070
I say.

679
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,736
Have you...

680
00:53:58,819 --> 00:53:59,911
Ever?

681
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,451
Never!

Oh, musha, musha.

00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,110
Poor little bloke.

688
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,237
Let's give him a hand.

689
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,614

00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,195

Tally ho!
Da-doo da-doo!

692
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,087
Up you go. Now hang on.

693
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:04,802
Would you look at this?
An elegant merry-go-round horse.

694
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:11,392
Come on, you dirty omadhauns.
I'll lick all of you.

695
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:15,196
Faster, me beauty.
Faster!

696
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,498
Riders, would you be kind
and let me pass?

697
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:11,373
Certainly, ma'am.

698
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,079
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma'am.

699
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,096
Excellent time, gentlemen.

700
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,181
- Quite.
- Perfect day for it.

701
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,893
Ahem.

702
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,778
Oh, how nice.

703
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,951
Hooray! Yay! Yay!

705
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:55,580
- How does it feel to win?
- Well...

706
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,915
- Gaining fame and fortune.
- Yes.

707
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:01,093
- Your picture in the newspaper.
- Actually...

708
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,798
Extreme good looks, may I say?

709
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,178
No words describe your emotion?

710
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:12,263
Gentlemen, on the contrary,
there's a very good word.

711
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,895
- Right?
- Tell them.

01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,884
I'll stay until the wind changes.

779
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,561
How long will that be?

780
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,730
It's time to go to sleep.

781
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,776
We couldn't possibly go to sleep.
So many lovely things happened today!

782
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:28,943
Did they?

783
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,113
We jumped into Bert's picture.

784
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,862
The horses fled the carousel.

785
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,113
And we went riding!

786
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,037
Tally ho! Tchunga!
Tally ho! Yoicks!

787
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,079
Really?

788
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:43,455
Don't you remember?
You won the race.

789
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,583
A respectable person like me?
How dare you.

790
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,131
I saw you do it.

791
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,757
Another word
and I'll summon a policeman.

792
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,837
I saw it happen!

793
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:59,050
- Go to sleep.
- I don't want to.

794
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,851
We're much too excited.

795
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:03,270
Very well. Suit yourselves.

816
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,003
Glorious day, Mr Binnacle, glorious.

817
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,010
Nobody sleeps this morning.
Put in double powder.

818
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,467
A double charge?
Aye, sir.

819
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,724
Shake things up a bit, what?

820
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,187
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma'am.

821
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,361
- You packed the spoiled eggs?
- Yes.

822
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:21,943
After our meeting, we're all going
to throw things at the prime minister.

823
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,574
How distinguished you look today.

824
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,702
What's all that fearful caterwauling?

825
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,204
It's cook singing.

826
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:34,379
- What's wrong with her?
- She's happy as a cricket.

827
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,458
Since you hired Mary Poppins,

828
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,135
the most extraordinary thing
has come over the household.

829
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:46,058
- Ellen hasn't broken a dish all morning.
- That is extraordinary.

830
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:51,184
She and cook fight
like cats and dogs, but today...

831
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,857
- I'll hold the door.
- Thanks ever so.

832
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,156
Ellen, stop making that offensive noise.

833
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:09,657
And shut the window.
That bird's giving me a headache.

834
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,249
Yes, sir.

835
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,875
Quiet!
You're giving the master a headache.

836
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,422
I'm sorry you're unwell.

837
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:26,882
Who said I'm unwell?

838
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:30,515
I just don't understand why
everyone's so confoundedly cheerful.

839

01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:41,191

Stop, stop, stop!

844
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,697
- Good morning, Father.
- Morning.

845
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,158
Mary Poppins taught us...

846
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:56,120
<i>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>

847
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,797
What are you talking about?
Supercali...

848
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,216
Whatever it is.

849
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,510
It's something to say when
you don't know what to say.

850
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:04,962
Yes, well, I always know what to say.

851
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,092
- Yes, hurry along, please.
- Yes, Father.

852

<i>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>

853
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:15,480
Winifred, will you explain
this unseemly hullabaloo?

854
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:18,525
I don't think there's
anything to explain.

855
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,151
The children just came in
to make you feel better.

856
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,823
I should like to be quite clear.

857
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:29,073
I am not out of sorts.
I'm in a perfectly equable mood.

858
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,871
I do not require
being made to feel better!

859
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,667
You're always saying you want
a cheerful and pleasant household.

860
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:41,124
I should like to make a differentiation
between cheerful and...

861
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,129
Excuse me, dear.

862
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,710
Posts, everyone, please!

863
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,966
I have no objection to cheerfulness.

864
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,969
I expect certain decorum.

865
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:53,177
I don't propose standing idly by

866
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,227
and letting Poppins
undermine the discipline...

867
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:02,402
There's something extremely odd
about this household

868
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:05,401
since that woman arrived,
and I've noticed it.

869
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,323
Yes, dear.

870
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,031
One thing more.

871
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,862
Yes, dear?

872
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,869
Have this piano repaired.

873
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,827
I like to have it in tune.

874
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:20,458
But, George, you don't play.

875
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:23,711
That is entirely beside the point!

876
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,480
Now, let me see.

877
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,184
We must go to the piano tuners,

878
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:47,023
then to Mrs Cory's shop
for some gingerbread,

879
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,661
then to the fishmonger's
for dover sole and prawns.

880
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,488
Michael,
stop stravaging along behind.

881
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:56,664
Ahoy, there!

882
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,286
Ahoy!

883
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,046
- Good day to you.
- Good morning, Admiral.

884
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:08,252
What fine adventure
are we off upon today?

885
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,927
Going to fight the Hottentots?

886
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,222
Dig for buried treasure?

887
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,425
We're going to buy fish.

888
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,727
Very good. Proceed at flank speed.

889
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,349
Aye, aye, sir.

890
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,057
Let's put our backs into it.

891
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,360
More spit and polish.
That's what's wanted.

892
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:28,734
Andrew.

893
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:32,241
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Woof! Woof! Woof!

894
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,783
Slow down. I can't understand a word.

895
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,365
Woof! Woof! Woof!

896
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,329
Again?

897
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,414
The poor man.

898
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,879
Woof! Woof! Woof!

899
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,509
Woof! Ah-choo!

900
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,928
Bless you.

901
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,507
Woof! Woof! Woof!

902
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,844
Why, yes, certainly.
I'll go straight-away.

903
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,803
- Thank you very much.
- Woof!

904
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,102
- What did he say?
- "You're welcome."

905
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:07,568
- And?
- He didn't say anything.

906
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,772
You know best.

907
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,277
I thought we were buying fish.

908
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,742
There's been a change of plans.

909
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,830
Come along, please. Don't straggle.

910
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,459
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.

911
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,418
You should go home and rest.

912
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,049
Woof!

913
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,643
- Bert, I'm glad you're here.
- I came right away.

914
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,693
How is he?

915
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,443
He's never been worse.

916
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,782
How about them?
It's contagious, you know.

917
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,406
- We'll get spots?
- Unlikely.

918
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,157
Ohh! Hoo hoo hoo!

919
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,331
Oh, Uncle Albert.

920
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,750
Bless my soul.

921
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,453
It's Mary Poppins. I'm delight... Ha-ha!

922
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,838
I'm delighted to see you.

923
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,631
Uncle Albert, you promised.

924
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,551
Ha-ha! I know.

925
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:17,005
I tried, really, I did.
I... Ho ho!

926
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:21,059
But I so enjoy laughing.
Ah ha ha!

927
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:25,059
When I start, it's up with...
Ha ha ha!

928
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,732
That's what happens.

929
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,354

930
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,563

Ha ha! Ha ha!

934
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:42,323
Don't you dare.
You'll only make him worse.

935
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:46,876
- It's quite serious.
- Keep a straight face.

936
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:50,546
Last time,
we took three days to get him down.

01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,224
<i>Hissing and fizzing like snakes</i>

964
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,316
Sss sss sss!

965
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,894
Not at all attractive.

966
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:57,522
<i>Some laugh too fast</i>

967
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,357
Hee hee hee hee!

968
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,235
<i>Some only blast</i>

969
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,199
Ha!

970
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,865
<i>Others they twitter like birds</i>

971
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:10,122
Hee hee hee hoo!
Hee hee hee hoo!

972
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,745
You're as bad as he is.

973
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:16,754
<i>Then there's that kind
what can't make up their mind</i>

974
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,252
Hmm hmm hmm, ha ha ha!

975
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,008
Hee hee hee, ho ho ho!

976
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,509
Hee ha ho huh?

977
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:29,392
<i>When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside</i>

978
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:34,067
<i>And squeak, hee,
as the squeakelers do</i>

979
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,188
Ha ha ha!

980
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,942
<i>I've got to let go</i>

981
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,864
<i>With a ho ho ho ho</i>

982
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,112
Ha ha ha ha!

983
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:47,243
<i>And a ho ho ho, hoo!</i>

984
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,073
How nice!

985
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:52,285
I was hoping you'd turn up.

986
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,209
We always have a jolly time.

987
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,468
<i>We love to laugh</i>

988
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,045
Ha ha ha ha!

989
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,347
<i>Loud and long and clear</i>

990
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:05,469
Hoo hoo hoo!

991
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,516
<i>We love to laugh</i>

992
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,720
Ha ha ha ha!

993
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,804
<i>So everybody can hear</i>

994
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,140
Ha ha ha!

995
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,645
<i>The more you laugh</i>

996
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,228
Don't you start. Come back here.

997
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,563
<i>We fin with glee</i>

998
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:20,646
Hee hee hee!

999
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,199
<i>And the more the glee</i>

1000
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:24,574
Ha ha ha ha!

1001
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,620
<i>The more we're a merrier we</i>

1002
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:37,255
Welcome, children. Welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1003
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,503
Pull up a chair.

1004
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,504
I say, you're a sight.

1005
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:48,933
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.

1006
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,102
He works in a watch factory.

1007
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,896
What's he do?

1008
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,771
He stands about all day
and makes faces.

1009
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,031
Makes faces in a watch factory!

1010
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,529
You made that up.

1011
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,290
That's good.

1012
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,084
Such behaviour.

1013
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:24,965
It's disgraceful
or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

1014
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,298
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

1015
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,180
What's the name of his other leg?

1016
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,138
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of...

1017
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:39,397
Children, it's tea time.
I won't have schedule interruptions.

1018
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,648
Please stay.

1019
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,105
Look, I have tea ready for you.

1020
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:45,986
And it's getting cold.

1021
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,660
I had hoped that maybe you would...

1022
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,958
Splendid! Thank you very much.

1023
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,081
Mind the bread and butter.

1024
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,332
Now watch, children.

1025
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:03,462
I knew she'd do it... A proper tea.

1026
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,795
I suppose you'll want me to pour.

1027
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,551
If I must, I must.

1028
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,553
But stop behaving
like laughing hyenas.

1029
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,354
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.

1030
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,809
- Bert?
- None for me.

1031
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:24,441
I'm glad you came.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.

1032
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:27,816
Pour some milk
for Michael and yourself.

1033
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:31,573
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes.

1034
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:37,330
The other day when it was cold,
a friend bought long underwear.

1035
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:41,496
The shopkeeper said,
"How long do you want it?"

1036
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,379
My friend said,
"From September to March."

1037
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:52,299
Jane! Control yourself!

1038
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,890
Children, please sit up properly.

1039
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,607
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Thank you, dear.

1040
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,901
I'm having fun.

1041
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,321
I wish you could always stay here.

1042
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,366
We'll have to. There's no way down.

1043
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,694
Oh, there is a way.

1044
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:18,125
I hate mentioning it because
you must think of something sad.

1045
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,076
Do it, please.

1046
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,083
Let me see.

1047
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,585
I've got the very thing.

1048
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,714
Yesterday, when my neighbour
answered the bell, a man was there.

1049
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:36,093
The man said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."

1050
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:39,349
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.

1051
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,557
Then he said, "I'll replace your cat."

1052
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,019
She said,
"Okay, but can you catch mice?"

1053
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,529
I started out saying...

1054
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,906
I try.
Really, I do.

1055
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:58,489
But everything ends up so hilarious.
I can't...

1056
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,620
I can't help...

1057
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,664
That will be enough of that.

1058
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,125
It's time to go home.

1059
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,427
Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.

1060
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:14,802
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

1061
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,096
Come along, children.

1062
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,849
Must you really go?

1063
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:26,731
People come to see me all the time,
and we have such a lovely time.

1064
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:32,157
Then they go home,
and I'm very, very sad about it.

1065
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,825
Don't worry.
We'll return soon.

1066
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,902
It was lovely.

1067
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,832
- Keep an eye on him, Bert.
- I'll stay a while.

1068
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,499
Thank you.

1069
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,794
Uncle Albert,

1070
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,591
I got a jolly joke I saved for
just such an occasion.

1071
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:53,010
- Want to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.

1072
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,589
Righto. It's about me granddad.

1073
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,016
One night, he had a nightmare.

1074
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:03,062
So scared he chewed his pillow to bits.

1075
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,686
Next morning, I says,
"How do you feel?"

1076
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:09,439
He says, "A little down in the mouth."

1077
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,527
There's nothing like a good joke.

1078
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,740
No, and that's nothing like a good joke.

1079
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,973
Bit late tonight, aren't you?

1080
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,307
I say, Banks!

1081
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,729
Is anything the matter, Banks?

1082
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,647
Banks!

1083
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,192
We're so glad you're home!

1084
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,027
We had the most wonderful afternoon.

1085
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:04,741
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

1086
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,827
We don't know anyone
called Smith.

1087
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:12,666
The second chap says,
"What's his other leg's name?"

1088
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,672
And a party on the ceiling.

1089
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,503
Children, be quiet.

1090
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,465
Mary Poppins says we'll go again.

1091
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:21,673
Oh?

1092
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,185
Oh, Mary Poppins said that?

1093
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,810
Please return to your room.

1094
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:31,563
Mary Poppins, will you come with me?

1095
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:33,360
As you wish.

1096
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:39,859
Mary Poppins, I regret what I must say.

1097
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,790
Good evening, George.
ls anything the matter?

1098
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,037
I'm afraid so.

1099
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,121
I have to dress for my rally.

1100
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:55,174
- I'd rather you be present.
- Of course, George.

1101
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:59,470
Mary Poppins,
I confess I'm disappointed in you.

1102
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,220
She's for it. I've heard this before.

1103
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,472
I don't deny I'm partially responsible

1104
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:10,273
for allowing
the children's worthless frivolity.

1105
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,146
But they must learn
the seriousness of life.

1106
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,444
But they're only children.

1107
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,647
In light of what's happened...

1108
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,483
George, are you certain?

1109
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,159
I believe I am.

1110
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:25,738
<i>A British bank is run with precision</i>

1111
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,667
<i>A British home requires nothing less</i>

1112
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:34,213
<i>Tradition, discipline, and rules
must be the tools</i>

1113
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:39,545
<i>Without them
disorder, chaos, moral disintegration</i>

1114
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,628
<i>In short, you have a ghastly mess</i>

1115
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,339
I quite agree.

1116
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:47,177
<i>The children must be
moulded, shaped and taught</i>

1117
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:50,684
<i>That life's a looming battle
to be faced and fought</i>

1118
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:55,394
I'm disturbed to hear my children
talking about popping into pictures,

1119
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:58,821
consorting with racehorse persons,
fox hunting...

1120
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:02,275
I don't mind that. It's tradition.

1121
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:05,362
But parties on the ceiling?

1122
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,367
Having tea parties on the ceiling?

1123
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:10,370
And other highly questionable outings...

1124
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,747
<i>If they must go on outings</i>

1125
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:17,627
<i>These outings ought to be fraught
with purpose, yes, and practicality</i>

1126
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,629
<i>These silly words like</i>

1127
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,260
Superca...

1128
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:23,053
Super...

1129
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,471
Supercal...

1130
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,514
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1131
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,183
Yes, well done.

1132
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:34,391
<i>And popping through pictures
have little use, fulfil no basic need</i>

1133
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:38,319
<i>They've got to learn the honest truth
Despite their youth</i>

1134
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:39,395
<i>They must learn</i>

1135
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,947
<i>About the life you lead</i>

1136
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,365
Exactly.

1137
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,571
<i>They must feel the thrill
of totting up a balanced book</i>

1138
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,453
<i>A thousand ciphers neatly in a row</i>

1139
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:52,749
Quite right.

1140
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,580
<i>When gazing at a graph
that shows the profits up</i>

1141
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,757
<i>Their little cup of joy should overﬂow</i>

1142
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,084
Precisely.

1143
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:04,887
<i>It's time they learnt
to walk in your footsteps</i>

1144
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:05,963
My footsteps.

1145
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,845
<i>To tread your straight
and narrow path with pride</i>

1146
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:09,925
With pride.

1147
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,681
<i>Tomorrow, just as you suggest</i>

1148
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,187
<i>Pressed and dressed
Jane and Michael will be at your side</i>

1149
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,110
Splendid! You've hit the nail...

1150
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,779
At my side? Where are we going?

1151
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,607
To the bank.

1152
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,738
- The bank?
- Yes.

1153
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,491
Tomorrow's an important day.

1154
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,369
I'll see they
have a proper night's sleep.

1155
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:47,464
Did I say
I'd take the children to the bank?

1156
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:50,140
It sounded that way.

1157
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,307
And why not?

1158
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,885
Capital idea.

1159
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:58,395
Just the medicine they need for all this
sugary female thinking they get here.

1160
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,317
Quite right. Good idea.

1161
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,235
Quite right.

1162
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,359
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go.

1163
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:09,114
What do you mean?

1164
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,945
Weren't you sacked?

1165
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:13,998
Sacked? I am never sacked.

1166
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:16,746
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hooray!

1167
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,453
Neither am I a maypole.

1168
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,163
- But. ..
- Goats butt.

1169
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,463
Birds fly.

1170
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,669
Children going out with their father
get some sleep.

1171
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,550
An outing with Father?

1172
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,049
He's never taken us on an outing.

1173
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:35,102
He's never taken us anywhere.

1174
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,137
How did you manage it?

1175
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:39,849
You gave him the idea.

1176
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,151
How impertinent!

1177
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:45,025
Me giving ideas to people? Really.

1178
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,697
- Where's he taking us?
- The bank.

1179
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:52,449
Michael, the city!
Father can point out the sights.

1180
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,872
Most things he can.

1181
01:23:55,572 --> 01:24:00,999
Sometimes people, through no fault
of their own, can't see past their nose.

1182
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,588
Past their nose?

1183
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:07,589
Yes. Sometimes
a little thing is quite important.

1184
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,716
Oh, look. The cathedral.

1185
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:13,095
Father passes that every day.

1186
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:19,146
<i>Early each day
to the steps of St. Paul's</i>

1187
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:24,899
<i>The little old bird woman comes</i>

1188
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:32,911
<i>In her own special way
to the people she calls</i>

1189
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:40,160
<i>Come buy my bags full of crumbs</i>

1190
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:43,917
<i>Come feed the little birds</i>

1191
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:47,296
<i>Show them you care</i>

1192
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:53,928
<i>And you'll be glad if you do</i>

1193
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:57,260
<i>Their young ones are hungry</i>

1194
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,721
<i>Their nests are so bare</i>

1195
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:05,355
<i>All it takes is tuppence</i>

1196
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:11,112
<i>From you</i>

1197
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:14,910
<i>Feed the birds</i>

1198
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:18,114
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1199
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:21,621
<i>Tuppence, tuppence</i>

1200
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,295
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1201
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,465
<i>Feed the birds</i>

1202
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,090
<i>That's what she cries</i>

1203
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:38,802
<i>While overhead,
her birds fill the skies</i>

1204
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:42,013
<i>All around the cathedral</i>

1205
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,644
<i>The saints and apostles</i>

1206
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:50,821
<i>Look down as she sells her wares</i>

1207
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:54,321
<i>Although you can't see it</i>

1208
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,824
<i>You know they are smiling</i>

1209
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:01,453
<i>Each time someone shows</i>

1210
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:07,413
<i>That he cares</i>

1211
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:14,588
<i>Though her words are simple and few</i>

1212
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:18,261
<i>Listen, listen</i>

1213
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:23,221
<i>She's calling to you</i>

1214
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:26,682
<i>Feed the birds</i>

1215
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:30,440
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1216
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:34,649
<i>Tuppence, tuppence</i>

1217
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:39,111
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1218
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:15,565
<i>Though her words are simple and few</i>

1219
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:19,026
<i>Listen, listen</i>

1220
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:24,206
<i>She's calling to you</i>

1221
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:27,455
<i>Feed the birds</i>

1222
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:32,381
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1223
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:35,300
<i>Tuppence</i>

1224
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:38,424
<i>Tuppence</i>

1225
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:45,478
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1226
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:11,787
Now, remember.
Be on your best behaviour.

1227
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,372
Isn't it your bank?

1228
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:17,210
As a younger officer, it is,
sort of.

1229
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,965
Michael, look.

1230
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,881
It's her!

1231
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,558
- Who? It's who?
- The bird woman.

1232
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,762
Just like Mary Poppins said.

1233
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,471
You see her?

1234
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:32,933
Of course I can. Do you think
I can't see past the end of my nose?

1235
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:35,269
Listen, she's saying it.

1236
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:38,151
Feed the birds.

1237
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,823
Tuppence a bag.

1238
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:43,072
Of course she's saying it.

1239
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,620
- May we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?

1240
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,790
- I have tuppence.
- Just this once.

1241
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,165
Waste your money on birds?
Certainly not.

1242
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:53,666
But Mary Poppins...

1243
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:59,218
I'm not interested in Mary Poppins
nor in hearing her name.

1244
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,260
But it's my tuppence.

1245
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,840
Michael, don't throw your money away!

1246
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,848
At the bank, I'll show you what to do.

1247
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,804
It's extremely interesting.

1248
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:49,517
Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

1249
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,061
My children.

1250
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:53,184
Why are they here?

1251
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,391
They're opening an account, sir.

1252
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:59,065
How much money do you have?

1253
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:02,273
Tuppence. I want it to feed the birds.

1254
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,323
tuppence!

1255
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,240
Tuppence...

1256
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,321
Precisely how I started.

1257
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:19,753
That's the elder Mr Dawes,
a giant in the finance world.

1258
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,378
A giant?

1259
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,758
Father, these are Banks' children!

1260
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,055
They want to open an account!

1261
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,101
Do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent.

1262
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:37,354
We can use more money
to put to work for the bank.

1263
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,571
You have tuppence?

1264
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,649
May I be permitted to see it?

1265
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,076
It's for feeding the birds.

1266
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:51,621
Feed the birds and what have you got?

1267
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,698
Fat birds!

1268
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:55,034
But...

1269
01:30:55,116 --> 01:31:01,340
<i>If you invest your tuppence
wisely in the bank</i>

1270
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:05,715
<i>Safe and sound</i>

1271
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,301
<i>Soon that tuppence</i>

1272
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:12,101
<i>Safely invested in the bank</i>

1273
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:16,476
<i>Will compound</i>

1274
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:22,561
<i>And you'll achieve
that sense of conquest</i>

1275
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:28,241
<i>As your afﬂuence expands</i>

1276
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:36,910
<i>In the hands of the directors</i>

1277
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:39,832
<i>Who in vest</i>

1278
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:46,089
<i>As propriety demands</i>

1279
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,922
- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.

1280
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:55,852
You see, Michael, you'll be part of
railways through Africa!

1281
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,600
Exactly.

1282
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,352
Dams across the Nile.

1283
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:03,186
- Talk about the ships.
- Fleets of ocean greyhounds.

1284
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,485
Tell them more.

1285
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:07,530
Majestic self-amortizing canals.

1286
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,858
It fires the imagination!

Give me the money, boy.

1295
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:54,153
I want to feed the birds.

1296
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,407
Banks!

1297
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,706
Yes, sir. Now, Michael...

1298
01:32:57,781 --> 01:33:02,252
<i>When you deposit
tuppence in a bank account</i>

1299

<i>Soon you'll see</i>

Tell him more!

1302
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:11,465
<i>That it blooms
into credit of a generous amount</i>

1303

<i>Semi-annually</i>

1304
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:21,271
<i>And you'll achieve that sense of stature</i>

1305
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:26,352
<i>As your influence expands</i>

1306
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:31,110
<i>To the high financial strata</i>

01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:34,864
<i>That established credit now commands</i>

1308
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:39,865
You can purchase
first and second trust deeds.

1309
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:41,662
Imagine the foreclosures,

1310
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,541
bonds, chattels, dividends, shares.

1311
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,621
Bankruptcies.

1312
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:47,705
Debtor sales.

1313
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,174
Opportunities.

1314
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:50,967
Private enterprise.

1315
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:52,134
Shipyards.

1316
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:53,632
- The mercantile.
- Collieries.

1317
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:54,758
Tanneries.

1318
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:56,636
Corporations, amalgamations.

1319
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,136
Banks!

1320
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:01,060
While stand the Banks of England,

1321
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,304
England stands.

1322
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:12,527
When fall the Banks of England,

1323
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,528
England falls!

1324
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,450
You see, Michael?

1325
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,665

Welcome to our joyful

Give it back!

1336
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:48,524
Michael, behave...

1337
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,443
Give it to him.

1338
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:54,113
Give me back my money!

1339
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:57,234
Give me back my money!

1340
01:34:57,317 --> 01:35:00,366
The bank won't
give someone their money.

1341
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:01,788
I'm getting mine.

1342
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:03,748
Come along, every penny!

1343
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:06,201
And give me mine, too.

1344
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:11,505
Stop all payments.

1345
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:12,958
Stop all payments.

1346
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:33,232
Give me my money!

1347
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:49,334
Children, come back!

1348
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,878
- Stop those children!
- Jane! Michael!

1349
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,338
Come on!

1350
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,434
Stop those children!

1351
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,436
Stop those children!

1352
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:14,815
Aah!

1353
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,416
Come with me.

1354
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,542
Granny will hide you!

1355
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:44,886
Aah!

1356
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:50,687
Aah!

1357
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:51,855
Aah!

1358
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,650
Here, half a mo.

1359
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,524
Leave my sister alone.

1360
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,988
Your friend won't hurt you.

1361
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:02,905
Bert, it's you.

1362
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:05,411
In the flesh and at your service.

1363
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:08,206
You're filthy.

1364
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,704
Perhaps a smudge.

1365
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:13,081
It so happens
today I'm a chimney sweep.

1366
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:15,539
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

1367
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:17,920
Don't take on so.

1368
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:20,843
Bert will take care of you.
Like I was your own father.

1369
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,303
Who's after you?

1370
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:23,345
Father.

1371
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,422
What?

1372
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,508
We went to his bank.

1373
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:29,852
We must have done
something dreadful.

1374
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:33,143
The police and army were after us.

1375
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,187
Michael, don't exaggerate.

1376
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:38,236
There must be some mistake.

1377
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,530
Your dad loves you.

1378
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:44,451
No, not with the look he had on his face.

1379
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,611
He doesn't like us.

1380
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,622
That don't seem likely, does it?

1381
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,161
It's true.

1382
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:54,248
Let's sit down.

1383
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,793
Begging your pardon,

1384
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:00,967
but my heart goes out to your father.

1385
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:05,092
There he is in that cold,
heartless bank,

1386
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:08,804
hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.

1387
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:10,934
I don't like seeing
living things caged up.

1388
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:13,687
Father in a cage?

1389
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:16,809
Cages come in all sizes and shapes,

1390
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,893
even bank-shaped.

1391
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:22,151
Father's not in trouble, we are.

1392
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,358
Sure about that, are you?

1393
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,995
You've got your mother
to look after you,

1394
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:32,828
and Mary Poppins
and Constable Jones and me.

1395
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,285
Who looks after your father?

1396
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:38,917
When something happens,
what does he do?

1397
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:41,090
Fends for himself, he does.

1398
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:42,337
Who does he tell?

1399
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,127
No one.

1400
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:46,508
Don't blab his troubles.

1401
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:48,339
He pushes on at his job,

1402
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:51,183
uncomplaining, alone, and silent.

1403
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:53,470
He's not very silent.

1404
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:55,430
Michael, be quiet.

1405
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,392
Bert, does Father really need our help?

1406
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,853
It's not my place to say.

1407
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:06,199
But fathers can always do
with a bit of help.

1408
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,151
I'll take you home.

1409
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:19,705

1414
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:34,931
<i>And that's lucky, too</i>

1415

Ellen, whoever that is, send them away.

1428
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:27,855
I'm dreadfully late.

1429
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:28,906
Yes, mum.

1430
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,198
I'll be leaving.

1431
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:33,490
Please stay till Father comes home!
Father will feel better

1432
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,571
if you shake hands with him.

1433
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,791
It's the children, mum.

1434
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,539
I thought they were with their father.

1435
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:43,417
You haven't been running off,
have you?

1436
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,124
They haven't exactly been
running away, mum.

1437
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:48,505
They've been frightened
and should be looked after.

1438
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:52,426
Oh, of course, Mary Poppins will...

1439
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:54,928
Oh, no, it's her day off.

1440
01:40:55,007 --> 01:40:56,384
Ellen, would you...

1441
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,562
No, mum. I haven't done me brasses.

1442
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:00,684
Ask Mrs Brill...

1443
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,640
Not for 100 quid.

1444
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:06,227
It's baking day,
and you know how cook is.

1445
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,689
What about you, sir?

1446
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:12,408
You've been so kind.

1447
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:14,118
Me, mum?

1448
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:16,992
Lord mayor's got
a stopped-up chimney.

1449
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,745
How clever of you to know.

1450
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:21,784
Our drawing room chimney

1451
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:24,461
is in the most ghastly condition.

1452
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,082
Thank you so much.

1453
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:31,590
Besides, it will amuse the children.

1454
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,345
The lord mayor's going
to be terrible put out.

1455
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:34,964
Thank you so much.

1456
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,720
I do appreciate it.

1457
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:37,925
I must hurry.

1458
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:41,889
Our gallant ladies in prison
are waiting for me to lead them in song.

1459
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,603
Good-bye, my darlings.

1460
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,868
<i>I choose me bristles
with pride, yes, I do</i>

1461
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,695
<i>A broom for the shaft</i>

1462
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,822
<i>And a brush for the ﬂue</i>

1463
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:04,877
It's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

1464
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:07,873
You see how wrong people can be?

1465
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:13,052
That's a doorway
to a place of enchantment.

1466
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:17,549
<i>Up where the smoke
is all billowed and curled</i>

1467
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,889
<i>'Tween pavement and stars</i>

1468
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,596
<i>ls the chimney sweep world</i>

1469
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:27,350
<i>When there's hardly no day</i>

1470
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:29,519
<i>Nor hardly no night</i>

1471
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:34,323
<i>There's things half in shadow</i>

1472
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,901
<i>And halfway in light</i>

1473
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:42,081
<i>On the rooftops of London</i>

1474
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:47,037
<i>Coo, what a sight</i>

1475
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:50,294
I wish we could go up there.

1476
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,007
I like chimneys.

1477
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:57,092
Rightly so.
A chimney is a wondrous thing.

1478
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:59,549
It's built tall up there on the roof.

1479
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:03,011
The wind blows across her top

1480
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:05,768
and draws the smoke right up the flue.

1481
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,441
Feel the pull on the end of that brush.

1482
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:12,361
It's like you've got a whale
at the end of the line, isn't it?

1483
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:13,608
Michael, be careful.

1484
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:16,282
Things happen around fireplaces.

1485
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:19,402
Oh, bother.

1486
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:25,036
Michael!

1487
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:27,585
Michael, come back down here!

1488
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:30,083
Michael, Michael, where are you?

1489
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:31,505
That's a bit awkward.

1490
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:34,417
Stop putting ideas in their heads.

1491
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:37,511
There goes another one.

1492
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:38,587
Shall I go after them?

1493
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:42,642
They can't
gallivant up there like kangaroos.

1494
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,474
Michael, everything's going to be...

1495
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,482
Will you put your things on?

1496
01:43:58,399 --> 01:43:59,992
Hurry up.
Spit spot.

1497
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:01,827
Thought you'd left.

1498
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:03,571
We didn't mean to.

1499
01:44:03,696 --> 01:44:05,289
No harm done.

1500
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:09,164
Truth is, this is
a fortuitous circumstance.

1501
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:10,540
Look there.

1502
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:16,759
A trackless jungle
just waiting to be explored.

1503
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:18,085
Why not, Mary Poppins?

1504
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:20,171
Oh, please, Mary Poppins.

1505
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:26,056
Oh, well... if we must,
we must.

1506
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:30,848
Fall in.

1507
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:32,942
Look lively.
Look lively.

1508
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,645
Jump to it.
Get in line.

1509
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,898
Attention!

1510
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:41,655
Slope arms!

1511
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:44,032
Right turn!

1512
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,037
Quick march!

1513
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:24,235
Hello there!

1514
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:31,917
It's just good clean soot,
Michael.

1515
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:38,795
Far as we go, right?

1516
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:40,171
Not at all.

1517
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:32,436
What did I tell you?

1518
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:34,184
The world's at your feet,

1519
01:46:35,806 --> 01:46:37,900
and who sees it but the birds,

1520
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:40,979
<i>the stars, and the chimney sweeps?</i>

1521
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:51,822
Quite nice.

1522
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:55,080
But we've had enough night air.
Follow me, please.

1523
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:10,303
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
<i>Chim chim cheree</i>

Ain't she marvellous?

Ain't she beautiful?

Lovely. Tell your mum.

Hello, hello, hello!

- More! More!
- Mary, do it again!

Here we go.

1593
01:52:58,063 --> 01:52:59,940
We're being attacked by Hottentots!

1594

Aye, aye, sir.

1595
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:03,948
Cheeky devils! Give them what for!

1596
01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:05,904
Empty the shot lockers!

Move along, Mr Binnacle.

Gun ready, sir.

1601

Stand by.

1602
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:27,808
Fire!

1603
01:53:47,738 --> 01:53:49,285
Fire!

1604
01:53:54,619 --> 01:53:55,916
Well hit, sir!

1605
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:57,418
Very well hit!

1606
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:19,645
Aah! They're at it again!

1607
01:54:19,728 --> 01:54:21,446
<i>They're at it again, step in time</i>

1608
01:54:21,521 --> 01:54:23,148
<i>At it again, step in time</i>

1609
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:27,861
<i>They're at it again, step in time</i>

1610
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:34,876
Ow!

1611
01:54:34,951 --> 01:54:36,373
<i>Ow! Step in time</i>

1612
01:54:36,453 --> 01:54:38,000
<i>Ow! Step in time</i>

1613
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:39,714
<i>Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme</i>

1614
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:40,916
Whoa!

1615
01:54:40,999 --> 01:54:42,091
<i>Step in time</i>

1616
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:47,506
Oh, Ellen, when you're free...

1617
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:49,717
<i>Votes for women, step in time</i>

1618
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:51,013
<i>Votes for women, step in time</i>

1619
01:54:51,093 --> 01:54:52,891
Not at the moment.

1620
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:53,936
<i>Votes for women</i>

1621
01:54:54,012 --> 01:54:55,138
Votes for women!

1622
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:08,823
It's the master!

1623
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:10,202
<i>It's the master, step in time</i>

1624
01:55:10,278 --> 01:55:11,370
<i>It's the master</i>

1625
01:55:11,446 --> 01:55:12,663
What's all this?

1626
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:13,782
What's all this?

1627
01:55:13,865 --> 01:55:15,458
<i>What's all this, what's all this</i>

1628
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:16,660
<i>What's all this</i>

1629
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:17,744
<i>Link your elbows, step in time</i>

1630
01:55:17,828 --> 01:55:19,671
What's all this? What's all this?

1631
01:55:19,788 --> 01:55:21,381
<i>Kick your knees up
Kick your knees up...</i>

1632
01:55:21,456 --> 01:55:22,503
Bert.

1633
01:55:26,878 --> 01:55:28,425
Good luck, guv'nor.

1634
01:55:28,505 --> 01:55:30,428
Lovely time.

1635
01:55:30,632 --> 01:55:32,851
Had an elegant time,
guv'nor.

1636
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:40,604
Good luck, guv'nor.

1637
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:22,897
Father,
every sweep shook your hand.

1638
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,320
You'll be so lucky!

1639
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:26,692
Come along, children.
Spit spot.

1640
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:28,364
One moment, Mary Poppins.

1641
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:30,909
What's the meaning of this?

1642
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:32,823
I beg your pardon?

1643
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:34,951
Will you explain all this?

1644
01:56:36,072 --> 01:56:38,541
I'd like to make one thing clear.

1645
01:56:38,617 --> 01:56:39,743
Yes.

1646
01:56:41,203 --> 01:56:43,205
I never explain anything.

1647
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,672
Yes? Banks here.

1648
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:54,641
Mr Dawes...

1649
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:56,969
I'm dreadfully sorry
about what happened today.

1650
01:56:57,052 --> 01:56:59,475
I can assure you that...

1651
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:01,431
Tonight, sir?

1652
01:57:01,806 --> 01:57:04,980
Yes. We'll expect you
at 9:00 precisely.

1653
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:06,061
Without fail.

1654
01:57:06,144 --> 01:57:07,817
Without fail.

1655
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:10,990
Why, yes, Banks.

1656
01:57:11,525 --> 01:57:13,243
It's extremely serious.

1657
01:57:13,318 --> 01:57:15,446
We regret this action.

1658
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:16,826
We regret this action.

1659
01:57:16,905 --> 01:57:19,829
You've been with us many years...

1660
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,577
You've been with us many years...

1661
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,583
As was your father.

1662
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:25,460
As was your father.

1663
01:57:26,706 --> 01:57:28,424
Yes, Mr Dawes.

1664
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,629
I shall be there at 9:00.

1665
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:56,737
A man has dreams
of walking with giants.

1666
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:02,830
To carve his niche in
the edifice of time.

1667
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:09,295
<i>Before the mortar of his zeal</i>

1668
01:58:09,374 --> 01:58:13,095
Has a chance to congeal

1669
01:58:13,169 --> 01:58:15,672
The cup's dashed from his lips.

1670
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:17,928
The flame's snuffed aborning.

1671
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:20,344
He's brought to wrack
and ruin in his prime.

1672
01:58:23,138 --> 01:58:24,765
Life's a rum go,
guv'nor.

1673
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:26,316
That's the truth.

1674
01:58:26,391 --> 01:58:29,565
I think it's Mary Poppins.

1675
01:58:29,644 --> 01:58:31,692
Since she's come,

1676
01:58:31,771 --> 01:58:33,148
things have happened to me.

1677
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:34,615
Mary Poppins?

1678
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:36,451
Yes, of course!

1679
01:58:36,526 --> 01:58:40,576
<i>My world was calm</i>

1680
01:58:40,655 --> 01:58:42,908
<i>Well ordered...</i>

1681
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:44,159
Exemplary.

1682
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:48,380
<i>Then came this person</i>

1683
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:51,758
<i>With chaos in her wake</i>

1684
01:58:53,752 --> 01:58:59,009
<i>And now my life's ambitions go</i>

1685
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:02,060
<i>With one fell blow</i>

1686
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:10,437
<i>It's quite a bitter pill</i>

1687
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:13,113
<i>To take</i>

1688
01:59:13,188 --> 01:59:15,407
That Poppins woman did it!

1689
01:59:15,899 --> 01:59:17,993
I know the person... Mary Poppins.

1690
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:20,116
She's the one what sings...

1691
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:23,327
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

1692
01:59:23,406 --> 01:59:26,876
<i>That is all it takes</i>

1693
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:30,751
<i>It changes bread and water into</i>

1694
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:32,457
<i>Tea and cakes</i>

1695
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:34,087
That's it exactly!

1696
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:37,046
Changing bread into cakes, indeed.

1697
01:59:37,212 --> 01:59:40,216
No wonder
everything's higgledy-piggledy.

1698
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:42,972
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

1699
01:59:43,093 --> 01:59:45,437
<i>Goes a long, long way</i>

1700
01:59:46,304 --> 01:59:49,399
<i>Have yourself a healthy helpin'</i>

1701
01:59:49,474 --> 01:59:52,148
<i>Every day</i>

1702
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:53,861
A healthy helpin' of trouble.

1703
01:59:53,937 --> 01:59:56,781
You know what she did? I realise it now.
She tricked me

1704
01:59:56,856 --> 01:59:58,904
into taking
Jane and Michael to the bank.

1705
01:59:58,983 --> 02:00:01,327
That's how the trouble started.

1706
02:00:01,403 --> 02:00:03,906
Tricked you into that?

1707
02:00:04,072 --> 02:00:05,745
Outrageous!

1708
02:00:05,824 --> 02:00:08,373
A man as important as you?

1709
02:00:08,493 --> 02:00:09,619
Shameful!

1710
02:00:11,454 --> 02:00:15,175
You're a man of high position,

1711
02:00:15,333 --> 02:00:18,337
esteemed by your peers.

1712
02:00:18,712 --> 02:00:21,966
<i>And when your little tykes are cryin'</i>

1713
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:25,268
<i>You haven't time to dry their tears</i>

1714
02:00:26,094 --> 02:00:29,974
<i>And see them grateful little faces</i>

1715
02:00:30,098 --> 02:00:33,693
<i>Smilin' up at you</i>

1716
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:35,983
<i>Because their dad</i>

1717
02:00:36,146 --> 02:00:40,572
<i>He always knows just what to do</i>

1718
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:42,202
I mean, look...

1719
02:00:42,318 --> 02:00:44,912
Like you say,
guv'nor...

1720
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:49,414
<i>You've got to grind, grind, grind</i>

1721
02:00:49,576 --> 02:00:53,046
<i>At that grindstone</i>

1722
02:00:53,121 --> 02:00:55,670
<i>Though childhood slips</i>

1723
02:00:55,874 --> 02:00:58,093
<i>Like sand</i>

1724
02:00:58,168 --> 02:00:59,545
<i>Through a sieve</i>

1725
02:01:01,337 --> 02:01:03,260
And all too soon

1726
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:06,218
<i>They've up and grown</i>

1727
02:01:06,301 --> 02:01:10,898
<i>And then they've flown</i>

1728
02:01:11,014 --> 02:01:17,522
<i>And it's too late for you to give</i>

1729
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:26,326
<i>Just that spoonful of sugar</i>

1730
02:01:26,446 --> 02:01:28,119
<i>To help the medicine</i>

1731
02:01:28,823 --> 02:01:30,700
<i>Go down</i>

1732
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:35,005
<i>The medicine go down</i>

1733
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:38,049
<i>Medicine go down</i>

1734
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:39,717
Well, goodbye, guv'nor.

1735
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:42,220
Sorry to have troubled you.

1736
02:01:55,183 --> 02:01:56,435
Father.

1737
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:59,980
We're sorry about the tuppence.

1738
02:02:00,104 --> 02:02:02,027
We didn't know it would
cause you so much trouble.

1739
02:02:10,073 --> 02:02:13,202
Here, Father.
You can have the tuppence.

1740
02:02:26,881 --> 02:02:28,758
Will that make everything all right?

1741
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:32,721
Thank you.

1742
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:26,853
Come in!

1743
02:05:36,738 --> 02:05:38,081
Take your hat off, Banks.

1744
02:05:52,754 --> 02:05:54,222
Good evening, gentlemen.

1745
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,228
Get on with it. Go on.

1746
02:06:00,303 --> 02:06:01,805
Yes, Father.

1747
02:06:05,725 --> 02:06:09,775
In 1773,
an official of this bank

1748
02:06:09,854 --> 02:06:12,323
unwisely loaned a large
sum of money

1749
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,363
to finance a shipment of tea

1750
02:06:14,442 --> 02:06:16,365
to the American colonies.

1751
02:06:16,778 --> 02:06:18,200
Do you know what happened?

1752
02:06:18,654 --> 02:06:22,830
I do.
As the ship lay in Boston Harbour,

1753
02:06:22,909 --> 02:06:25,458
colonists dressed as Red Indians

1754
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:28,798
boarded, behaved rudely,

1755
02:06:28,915 --> 02:06:30,542
and threw the tea overboard.

1756
02:06:30,958 --> 02:06:33,677
This made the tea
unsuitable for drinking,

1757
02:06:33,753 --> 02:06:36,222
even for Americans.

1758
02:06:41,052 --> 02:06:42,144
Precisely.

1759
02:06:42,595 --> 02:06:44,597
The loan was defaulted.

1760
02:06:45,264 --> 02:06:47,938
Panic ensued within these walls.

1761
02:06:48,017 --> 02:06:51,066
There was a run on the bank.

1762
02:06:51,187 --> 02:06:53,235
From that time to this,

1763
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:58,237
there has not been a run on this bank.

1764
02:06:59,403 --> 02:07:00,996
Until today!

1765
02:07:01,572 --> 02:07:04,872
A run, sir, caused by
the disgraceful conduct

1766
02:07:04,992 --> 02:07:06,539
of your son.

1767
02:07:06,786 --> 02:07:08,254
Do you deny it?

1768
02:07:08,704 --> 02:07:10,377
No, sir.

1769
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:14,545
I shall gladly assume
responsibility for my son.

1770
02:07:18,548 --> 02:07:19,549
Why are you waiting?

1771
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:21,054
Get on with it.

1772
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:22,597
Yes, Father.

1773
02:07:41,904 --> 02:07:43,076
No, not that!

1774
02:07:43,156 --> 02:07:44,157
Steady on.

1775
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:07,389
Do you have anything to say?

1776
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:10,524
Sir, they do say

1777
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,353
that when there's nothing to say,

1778
02:08:13,477 --> 02:08:15,571
all you can say...

1779
02:08:19,483 --> 02:08:20,826
Confound it, Banks!

1780
02:08:20,902 --> 02:08:22,620
Do you have anything to say?

1781
02:08:25,865 --> 02:08:27,742
Just one word, sir.

1782
02:08:27,825 --> 02:08:28,872
Yes?

1783
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:31,124
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1784
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:34,290
What?

1785
02:08:34,498 --> 02:08:37,468
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1786
02:08:37,543 --> 02:08:38,669
Mary Poppins was right.

1787
02:08:38,753 --> 02:08:40,721
It does make you feel better.

1788
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:44,559
There's no such word.

1789
02:08:44,634 --> 02:08:47,103
It is a perfectly good word.

1790
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:49,684
Do you know
what there's no such thing as?

1791
02:08:49,805 --> 02:08:54,151
With due respect,
there's no such thing as you!

1792
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:57,487
Impertinence, sir!

1793
02:08:57,605 --> 02:09:00,654
Would you like to hear
a marvellous joke?

1794
02:09:00,775 --> 02:09:02,277
A real snapper.

1795
02:09:02,443 --> 02:09:03,911
Joke? Snapper?

1796
02:09:04,111 --> 02:09:08,582
Jane and Michael
meet one day on the street.

1797
02:09:08,658 --> 02:09:13,255
Jane says, "I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith."

1798
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:17,334
Michael says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"

1799
02:09:20,002 --> 02:09:22,346
The man's gone mad.
Call the guard!

1800
02:09:22,505 --> 02:09:24,473
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1801
02:09:24,548 --> 02:09:26,346
I'm feeling better!

1802
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,223
Don't strike my father!

1803
02:09:28,302 --> 02:09:30,976
There's the tuppence,
the wonderful, fateful,

1804
02:09:31,055 --> 02:09:33,023
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
tuppence.

1805
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:35,692
Guard it well. Good-bye!

1806
02:09:35,768 --> 02:09:37,770
Where are you going?

1807
02:09:37,853 --> 02:09:41,824
I might pop through
a chalk pavement picture

1808
02:09:41,899 --> 02:09:45,369
or seize a horse off a merry-go-round

1809
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:46,866
or fly a kite.

1810
02:09:46,946 --> 02:09:48,573
Only Poppins knows.

1811
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:51,205
- Poppins?
- My nanny.

1812
02:09:51,284 --> 02:09:53,582
She sings that ridiculous song.

1813
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:55,754
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

1814
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:58,128
<i>Makes the medicine go down</i>

1815
02:09:58,207 --> 02:10:00,130
<i>The medicine go down</i>

1816
02:10:00,209 --> 02:10:02,712
<i>The medicine go down</i>

1817
02:10:02,878 --> 02:10:04,004
<i>The medicine...</i>

1818
02:10:05,381 --> 02:10:08,305
Mad as a March hare.

1819
02:10:08,426 --> 02:10:11,225
A wooden leg named Smith.

1820
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:17,068
A wooden leg named Smith.

1821
02:10:19,437 --> 02:10:21,064
A wooden le...

1822
02:10:35,202 --> 02:10:36,749
Father.

1823
02:10:37,079 --> 02:10:38,626
Father!

1824
02:10:38,748 --> 02:10:40,591
Father, come down!

1825
02:10:40,666 --> 02:10:42,088
Daddy!

1826
02:10:42,209 --> 02:10:45,258
Daddy, come back!

1827
02:10:53,846 --> 02:10:55,314
Wind's come around,

1828
02:10:55,389 --> 02:10:58,393
blowing dead on from the west.

1829
02:11:00,394 --> 02:11:02,567
She doesn't care what happens to us.

1830
02:11:02,938 --> 02:11:04,315
She only promised to stay

1831
02:11:04,398 --> 02:11:07,151
till the wind changed, right?

1832
02:11:07,943 --> 02:11:09,536
Bring my hat stand, please.

1833
02:11:13,115 --> 02:11:16,039
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

1834
02:11:19,288 --> 02:11:22,041
What would happen to me

1835
02:11:22,124 --> 02:11:25,628
if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?

1836
02:11:28,547 --> 02:11:31,676
That's right. George W. Banks,

1837
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:34,057
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1838
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:36,559
About 6'1", I'd say.

1839
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:40,189
Yes, we rang up his bank first thing.

1840
02:11:40,267 --> 02:11:44,067
We discovered he'd
been discharged last night.

1841
02:11:44,146 --> 02:11:47,491
No telling what he'll do
in a fit of despondency.

1842
02:11:47,566 --> 02:11:49,489
Wouldn't hurt to drag the river.

1843
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:53,493
There's a spot popular with jumpers.

1844
02:11:53,656 --> 02:11:54,999
Really, Ellen!

1845
02:11:56,659 --> 02:11:59,708
He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman.

1846
02:11:59,787 --> 02:12:02,757
No hanky-panky.

1847
02:12:02,873 --> 02:12:05,922
Regular habits,
as far as anyone knows.

1848
02:12:06,001 --> 02:12:08,504
<i>The medicine go down</i>

1849
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:10,176
<i>Just a spoonful...</i>

1850
02:12:10,256 --> 02:12:11,428
It's him!

1851
02:12:11,507 --> 02:12:13,475
Or something similar.

1852
02:12:13,551 --> 02:12:16,805
A little less noise on the premises.

1853
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:18,647
I can't understand the inspector.

1854
02:12:20,808 --> 02:12:23,812
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar</i>

1855
02:12:24,019 --> 02:12:26,863
<i>Makes the medicine go down</i>

1856
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:29,450
You didn't jump in the river.

1857
02:12:29,525 --> 02:12:31,698
How sensible of you.

1858
02:12:31,777 --> 02:12:33,154
It's all right, sir.

1859
02:12:33,237 --> 02:12:34,955
He's been found.

1860
02:12:35,322 --> 02:12:37,416
No, alive,

1861
02:12:37,533 --> 02:12:38,705
or so I presume.

1862
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,582
He's kissing Mrs Banks.

1863
02:12:41,495 --> 02:12:43,213
What happened at the bank?

1864
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:46,752
I've been sacked, flung into the street.

1865
02:12:46,834 --> 02:12:48,757
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

1866
02:12:48,836 --> 02:12:51,430
<i>Makes the medicine go down</i>

1867
02:12:51,505 --> 02:12:55,760
Gone off his crumpet,
that's what he's done.

1868
02:12:55,843 --> 02:12:58,221
Dotty as you please.

1869
02:12:59,096 --> 02:13:01,645
What were you doing in the cellar?

1870
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:03,567
First, where are the children?

1871
02:13:03,726 --> 02:13:05,649
Jane! Michael!

1872
02:13:05,728 --> 02:13:07,025
Your father's calling.

1873
02:13:07,104 --> 02:13:08,981
It doesn't sound like Father.

1874
02:13:09,064 --> 02:13:10,611
Jane! Michael!

1875
02:13:10,733 --> 02:13:12,735
Run along. Spit spot.

1876
02:13:17,948 --> 02:13:21,122
You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

1877
02:13:21,243 --> 02:13:22,244
Spit Spot.

1878
02:13:33,631 --> 02:13:35,224
He mended it!

1879
02:13:40,721 --> 02:13:41,768
It's wonderful!

1880
02:13:41,889 --> 02:13:44,312
However did you manage it?

1881
02:13:44,433 --> 02:13:47,528
<i>With tuppence for paper and strings</i>

1882
02:13:47,603 --> 02:13:50,857
<i>You can have your own set of wings</i>

1883
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:53,113
<i>With your feet on the ground</i>

1884
02:13:53,275 --> 02:13:56,370
<i>You're a bird in ﬂight</i>

1885
02:13:56,445 --> 02:14:00,075
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

1886
02:14:00,199 --> 02:14:01,997
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

1887
02:14:02,284 --> 02:14:04,707
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1888
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:08,624
<i>Let's go ﬂy a kite</i>

1889
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:12,216
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1890
02:14:12,294 --> 02:14:15,514
<i>Let's go ﬂy a kite</i>

1891
02:14:15,631 --> 02:14:19,306
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1892
02:14:19,468 --> 02:14:22,813
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1893
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:26,392
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1894
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:30,525
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

1895
02:14:32,189 --> 02:14:34,783
A proper kite needs a proper tail.

1896
02:14:34,858 --> 02:14:36,531
That's what I said.

1897
02:14:36,652 --> 02:14:38,654
Go fly a kite.

1898
02:14:40,155 --> 02:14:44,035
No, sir. I don't mean you personally.

1899
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:47,709
<i>Let's go ﬂy a kite</i>

1900
02:14:47,788 --> 02:14:50,917
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

02:15:05,264 --> 02:15:09,360
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

1906
02:15:11,478 --> 02:15:15,108
<i>When you send it ﬂying up there</i>

1907
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:18,577
<i>All at once you're lighter than air</i>

1908
02:15:18,652 --> 02:15:20,620
<i>You can dance on the breeze</i>

1909
02:15:20,696 --> 02:15:23,745
<i>Over houses and trees</i>

1910
02:15:23,866 --> 02:15:26,335
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

1911
02:15:27,244 --> 02:15:29,838
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

1912
02:15:29,913 --> 02:15:32,086
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1913
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:36,178
<i>Let's go ﬂy a kite</i>

1914
02:15:36,253 --> 02:15:39,553
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

<i>And send it soaring</i>

1917
02:15:46,513 --> 02:15:48,811
There you are, Banks.

1918
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:50,985
Congratulations.

1919
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:52,607
Capital bit of humour.

1920
02:15:52,728 --> 02:15:55,072
"Wooden leg named Smith,"

1921
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:57,445
or Jones, whatever it was.

1922
02:15:57,524 --> 02:15:58,901
Father died laughing.

1923
02:16:00,653 --> 02:16:02,280
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

1924
02:16:02,363 --> 02:16:05,492
Nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.

1925
02:16:05,616 --> 02:16:07,994
Never seen him happier.

1926
02:16:08,077 --> 02:16:10,250
He left an opening for a new partner.

1927
02:16:10,454 --> 02:16:12,582
Congratulations.

1928
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:16,260
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

1929
02:16:16,335 --> 02:16:19,839
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

<i>Fly a kite</i>

1933
02:16:31,767 --> 02:16:34,691
Awk!
That's gratitude for you.

1934
02:16:34,812 --> 02:16:36,860
Didn't even say goodbye.

1935
02:16:36,939 --> 02:16:38,236
No, they didn't.

1936
02:16:38,357 --> 02:16:39,825
Look at them.

1937
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:44,280
They think more
of their father than of you.

1938
02:16:44,363 --> 02:16:46,536
That's as it should be.

1939
02:16:46,615 --> 02:16:48,913
Don't you care?

1940
02:16:48,992 --> 02:16:51,370
Practically perfect people
never permit sentiment

1941
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:52,955
to muddle their thinking.

1942
02:16:53,038 --> 02:16:54,711
Is that so?

1943
02:16:54,790 --> 02:16:58,385
Mary Poppins, you don't fool me.

1944
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,552
Really?

1945
02:16:59,628 --> 02:17:03,178
Really. I know how you feel.

1946
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:07,262
If you think
I'm keeping my mouth shut...

1947
02:17:07,886 --> 02:17:11,356
That will be quite enough, thank you.

1948
02:17:33,537 --> 02:17:35,255
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.

1949
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:36,673
Don't stay away too long.

1950
02:18:23,545 --> 02:18:26,298
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1951
02:18:26,381 --> 02:18:29,931
<i>Let's go ﬂy a kite</i>

1952
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:33,435
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1953
02:18:33,514 --> 02:18:36,939
<i>Let's go ﬂy a kite</i>

1954
02:18:37,017 --> 02:18:40,487
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1955
02:18:40,562 --> 02:18:44,066
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1956
02:18:44,149 --> 02:18:47,653
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1957
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:52,333
<i>Oh, let's go</i>

1958
02:18:52,407 --> 02:18:55,536
<i>Fly a kite</i>
