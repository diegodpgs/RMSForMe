1
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,562
You are confused, aren't you?
Frightened.

2
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,297
That's all right. I can help you.

3
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,331
Who is this?

4
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,400
I am a doctor.
Now, you must listen to me.

5
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,103
You have lost your memory.
There was an experiment.

6
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,038
Something went wrong.
Your memory was erased.

7
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,072
Do you understand me?

8
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,208
No, I don't understand.
What the hell is going on here?

9
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,777
Just listen. There are people
coming for you even as we speak.

10
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,481
You must not let them find you.
You must leave now.

11
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,246
Hello? Are you there?

12
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,845
Hey, Mr. Murdoch.
The Automat called.

13
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,748
Said you left your wallet there.

14
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,051
I suggest you retrieve it since
you only paid for 3 weeks...

15
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,242
and they was up 10 minutes ago.

16
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,657
I've been here 3 weeks?

17
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,693
It's right there in
black and white, Mr. Murdoch.

18
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,423
Day and date.

19
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,632
We make our books like we make
our beds, all neat and tidy.

20
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,501
I'll take care of it when I get back.

21
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,703
See that you do.
Only thing makes you a guest...

22
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:16,434
in this joint, pal,
is cash on the barrelhead.

23
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,599
House rules.
3 weeks is 3 weeks.

24
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,650
No days off for good behavior.

25
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,987
Mr. Murdoch, yes, where is he?

26
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,725
He just left not 5 minutes ago.

27
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,895
Sleep now.

28
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,237
When marimba rhythms
start to play

29
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,336
Dance with me

30
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,371
Make me sway

31
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:33,545
Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore

32
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,781
Hold me close

33
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,586
Sway me more

34
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,890
Like a flower
bending in the breeze

35
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,329
Bend with me

36
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,265
Sway with ease

37
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,465
When we dance
you have a way with me

38
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,700
Stay with me

39
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,174
Sway with me

40
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,397
Hey, sweetie!

41
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,180
He said he was your
husband's doctor.

42
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,051
He wanted to speak with you.

43
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,086
Excuse me.

44
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,067
Dr. Sh..

45
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,176
Schreber. Please,
won't you come in?

46
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,727
You must be Emma Murdoch.

47
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,117
Thank you for coming to see me
on such short notice.

48
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,847
What is this?

49
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,857
A rather crude experiment...
designed to further my studies.

50
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,058
I don't understand.

51
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:52,197
You say you're my husband's doctor,
but he never mentioned you to me.

52
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,565
The truth is, Mrs. Murdoch...

53
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,067
John has been coming to
see me for quite some time.

54
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,838
He had been grappling
with feelings of betrayal...

55
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,008
stemming from your
marital difficulties.

56
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,244
- John told you what happened?
- Yes.

57
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,580
When was the last time
that you saw him?

58
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,048
3 weeks ago.

59
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,885
He packed a suitcase.
He was very angry at me.

60
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,922
I understand how difficult
this must be for you.

61
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,590
But for John's sake,
I would like you...

62
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,259
to think of me
as your friend, Emma.

63
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,063
It appears that John has suffered
a psychotic break.

64
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,154
Complete memory loss.

65
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,001
He may be delusional.

66
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,902
Even violent.

67
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,371
Emma...

68
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,876
if he were to contact you,
and I suspect he will...

69
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,779
you must call me immediately.
Do you understand?

70
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,183
It is imperative that I be
the first one to reach him.

71
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:49,634
Wherever your husband is,
he is searching...

72
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,414
...for himself.

73
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,436
Good evening, Mr. Murdoch.

74
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,238
It is Mr. Murdoch, isn't it?

75
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:11,107
Mr. -was it
"J"- something-Murdoch?

76
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,240
J. Murdoch.

77
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,773
What's your name? Justin? Jerry?

78
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,847
No.

79
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,623
My name's Jason Murdoch.
John Murdoch.

80
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,091
Jake Murdoch. How's it going?

81
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,822
Hi. Jack Murdoch.

82
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,552
Hi.

83
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,768
Bumstead.

84
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,709
I told the guy,
"Cash on the barrelhead. "

85
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,212
I said, "Listen, 3 weeks is 3 weeks. "

86
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,480
Where's our lucky winner?

87
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,314
Upstairs, sir, room 614.

88
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,115
Another call girl.

89
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,679
"J. Murdoch. "

90
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,625
Evening, Husselbeck.

91
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,993
Inspector Bumstead.

92
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,044
Your lace is untied.

93
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,224
Sir.

94
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,676
Am I glad you're here, sir.

95
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,345
They say Detective Walenski's
got the heebie-jeebies.

96
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:58,436
Just take what they give me,
Husselbeck.

97
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:10,259
Wow. Looks like somebody
woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

98
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,420
- Hello.
- Oh, it's you.

99
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,873
You left your wallet here, buddy.

100
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,207
When did I do that?

101
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,375
When you was last here.

102
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,545
- When was that?
- When you left your wallet.

103
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,186
You expect me to remember?

104
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,348
Hello. Excuse me.

105
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,256
No, no, seriously.

106
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,526
Alleged?

107
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,910
- Where you headed, chief?
- Home.

108
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:32,977
And where's home?

109
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,780
Haven't you mugs got
anything better to do?

110
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,082
Well, I'm just trying
to do my job, May.

111
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,185
There's a killer out there
in case you hadn't noticed.

112
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:46,257
Maybe you should be out looking for him
instead of cooling your heels, huh?

113
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,678
Go on, get out of here.

114
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,224
Come on.

115
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,987
Round and round she goes.

116
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:07,204
Where she stops? Nobody knows.

117
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,551
What's that make so far, Husselbeck?
6 hookers in all?

118
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,053
I believe so, sir.

119
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,622
Give the man an "A" for effort.

120
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,891
You'd think these stiffs
would have the good grace...

121
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,027
to expire at a good time of night.

122
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,348
Hey, too bad about Walenski, huh?

123
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,267
I guess he'd seen enough.

124
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,989
So, Husselbeck...

125
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:46,116
what kind of killer do you think
stops to save a dying fish?

126
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,185
You've got me, sir.

127
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,354
Bumstead, what took you?

128
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,657
This killer's been running circles
around us thanks to Walenski.

129
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,459
With all due respect,
Chief Inspector...

130
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,495
I've known Eddie a long time.
He's a good cop.

131
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,733
Whatever kind of cop Walenski once was,
he let drift a long time ago.

132
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,601
Let me talk to Bumstead!

133
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,003
Come on, let's go.

134
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,369
Hold on!

135
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,703
Frank, Frank!

136
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,342
Get his arm!

137
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,377
They're watching us!

138
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,444
On your feet.

139
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,913
There's no way out!

140
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,281
Don't make us hurt you.

141
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,382
God, can't you see?!

142
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,754
Let me go, let me go!

143
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,290
I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not..

144
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,151
- What was that?
- Walenski.

145
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,103
I'm being punished for my sins, right?

146
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,506
What did I ever do to inherit this?

147
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,640
Where do you begin?

148
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:47,679
Well, everything Detective Walenski
committed to paper should be here, so..

149
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,784
The only thing that should
be committed is Walenski.

150
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,645
Nothing like a little healthy paranoia.

151
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:03,157
Sir, we just got
the fingerprint results in.

152
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,444
What is this, some kind of joke?

153
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,810
Don't throw anything away.

154
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,537
Inspector Bumstead.

155
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,550
I came here to file
a missing persons report for my husband.

156
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,485
Take it to the front desk.

157
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,496
They told me to come see you.

158
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,550
His name's John Murdoch.

159
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,395
Mrs. Murdoch,
why didn't you report this before?

160
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:42,633
I mean, if your husband has been missing
as long as you say...

161
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:46,504
I thought he'd simply
walked out on me.

162
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,508
Then a... doctor contacted me
this evening.

163
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,176
How long have you been married?

164
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,997
Nearly four years.

165
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,445
Why do you ask?

166
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,617
Because you seem uncomfortable
with your ring.

167
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:03,321
As if you were...
unaccustomed to wearing it.

168
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,832
No, I never take it off.

169
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,357
Do these names
mean anything to you?

170
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,166
No. Who are these women?

171
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,910
Why are you looking
for my husband?

172
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,812
Are you going to accuse him
of something?

173
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,111
Maybe. Maybe murder.

174
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,469
Whose murder?

175
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,281
- Which one?
- All of them.

176
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,490
Mrs. Murdoch,
I am sorry, I'm sorry.

177
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,591
I didn't mean to alarm you.

178
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,194
I'm so sorry that I came.
Just both made a mistake.

179
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,695
Mrs. Murdoch, if you please.

180
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:49,706
If you'll just give me
half a second to explain..

181
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,389
I'll be right out.

182
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,925
Have we met before?

183
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,632
If we did...
I hope you're still breathing.

184
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,093
What's your name, honey?

185
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,302
John.

186
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,707
Well, that's an appropriate name.

187
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,697
Yeah.

188
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,899
I was just thinking.

189
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,812
What you do...

190
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,356
seems kind of dangerous...

191
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,384
right now.

192
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,196
I mean, how do you know
I'm not the killer?

193
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:56,477
You don't seem like
the killer type. Why?

194
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:00,922
You feeling any urges
I should know about?

195
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,251
Aw, shoot.

196
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:26,279
So it seems you've discovered
your unpleasant nature.

197
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,893
Who are you?

198
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,597
We might ask
the same question, yes?

199
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,192
Sleep now.

200
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
He can tune.

201
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,317
What is to be done?
This man is dangerous.

202
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,285
It is said he is able to tune.

203
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,651
Impossible.

204
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,523
We have seen it
with our own eyes.

205
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,992
On occasion the imprinting
does not take.

206
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,995
They behave erratically
when they awaken.

207
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,665
We find them wandering
like lost children.

208
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,867
But this one was different, yes?

209
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,602
What has the doctor
to say about this?

210
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,638
He has failed to report in.

211
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,808
- And Mr. Quick?
- No more Mr. Quick.

212
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,801
Mr. Quick, dead, yes.

213
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,442
Poor, poor Mr. Quick.

214
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,351
Mr. Book, does he know?

215
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,490
Should we not know, Mr. Hand?

216
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,393
We had hoped to learn more
before sharing with you.

217
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:46,397
We can know nothing
until we possess him.

218
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,999
Mr. Night, you will take the East.

219
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,798
Mr. Face, you the West.

220
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,971
Mr. Glove, the South.

221
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,202
Mr. Shade, the North.

222
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,712
We must have this man.

223
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,930
Do you really think my husband could be
capable of committing those murders?

224
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,956
Do you?

225
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:27,954
Let's hope, for both our sakes,
that I'm wrong.

226
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,861
John.

227
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,405
I've been so worried about you.

228
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,888
Are you punishing me?

229
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,524
You know, if disappearing
is your way of punishing me...

230
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,659
I don't appreciate it.

231
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,760
I don't know what
you're talking about.

232
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,099
I found these keys in my pocket...

233
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,796
so I assume I live here.

234
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,637
You supposed to be my wife?

235
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,663
Supposed to be?

236
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,732
John.

237
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,006
You really...

238
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,276
don't know who I am, do you?

239
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,548
Your doctor called me.

240
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,083
He was worried
that this might happen.

241
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,574
My doctor?

242
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,144
Yeah. He...

243
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,256
he gave me his card.

244
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,825
He's desperate to find you.

245
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,351
Schreber.

246
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,801
I feel like I'm living out
someone else's nightmare.

247
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:07,304
What happened to me?
Why was I seeing a doctor?

248
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,432
I had an affair.

249
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,943
You were angry at me.

250
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,281
The police are looking for you.

251
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,617
I know. I saw the papers.

252
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,108
"Killer stalks city streetwalkers. "

253
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,285
I was with one of those women...

254
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,795
before I came here tonight.

255
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,497
I don't understand.

256
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,458
I met her outside an Automat.

257
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,069
I guess I wanted to test myself.

258
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,040
I wanted to know if I had it in me
to do those things.

259
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:51,291
Maybe I have lost my mind, but whoever
I am, I'm still me and I'm not a killer.

260
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,953
I believe you.

261
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,016
You do?

262
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,216
What?

263
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,096
The car outside,
the one you arrived in.

264
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:09,837
It's a cop.
He dropped me off here.

265
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,237
I didn't know he was still here.

266
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,262
John.

267
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,394
Hold it right there, mister!

268
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,712
Wait. You have the wrong man.

269
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,880
Stand aside, will you, please?

270
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,515
I didn't kill anyone.

271
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:28,552
Right now what you are
is a suspect. Turn yourself in.

272
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,154
I'll listen to whatever
you have to say.

273
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:33,157
You're not gonna believe
what I have to say.

274
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,250
Try me.

275
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,460
There's someone after me.

276
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,630
There's this group of men.
They want me dead.

277
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,033
And I don't even know if..
They're not even..

278
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,302
Yeah, who's gonna
listen to a madman?

279
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,137
Stand aside, Mrs. Murdoch.

280
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,264
Run!

281
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,840
No one ever listens to me.

282
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,795
Murdoch, stop!

283
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,956
Murdoch!

284
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,195
How much further?

285
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,836
We're almost there, buddy.

286
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,770
Hey, you happen to know
the way to Shell Beach?

287
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,706
You're kidding. Me and the missus
spent our honeymoon there.

288
00:27:55,707 --> 00:28:00,397
All you gotta do is take
Main Street west to..

289
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,013
Or is it the cross..

290
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,684
You know, that's funny.
I can't seem to remember...

291
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:11,195
if it's Main Street west
or the cross-town.

292
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,227
I'm sorry, Inspector,
I cannot be of more assistance...

293
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,129
but I am running late
for an appointment.

294
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,220
Well, I appreciate
your taking the time.

295
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,975
There's just one thing
that puzzles me.

296
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:36,680
I've met quite a few murderers
in the course of my work.

297
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,383
Murdoch doesn't strike me as one.

298
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,087
Perhaps you are not
accustomed to digging deep enough.

299
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,656
Well, I do know when someone
is lying to me, Doctor.

300
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,325
Forgive me, Inspector,
but you are not a clinician.

301
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:52,096
Judging personalities
happens to be my business.

302
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,164
Well, maybe you could
give me a few pointers.

303
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,996
Certainly.

304
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,102
Let's take you, for instance.

305
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,470
You are a fastidious man, driven.

306
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,565
Consumed by details.

307
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,122
I would say your life is...

308
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,955
rather lonely.

309
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:14,207
Good evening, Inspector.
I really must be going.

310
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,625
Closing time.
The pool is now closed.

311
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,722
Dr. Schreber.

312
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:12,743
Most unfortunate it is that we were
forced to seek you out here.

313
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:16,113
You know how uncomfortable
we find all this...

314
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,376
moisture.

315
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,018
- I'm sorry. I..
- Failed to report in, yes.

316
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,687
I was frightened.
I have a weak heart, you know.

317
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:27,591
Your weakness is not, we think,
an affair of the heart.

318
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,294
We found this
in his hotel room.

319
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:34,264
Must we reproduce
Mr. Murdoch's memories again?

320
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,365
I tried to imprint him...

321
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,534
but he woke up, he knocked the syringe
right out of my hand.

322
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,670
I tried to stop him but he was too fast.

323
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,871
He has no memories, then?

324
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,274
Only fragments.
The procedure, it was interrupted.

325
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:48,111
I guess it's only a matter
of rounding him up.

326
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,713
You have had strays
before, right?

327
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,784
This is no stray, Doctor.
This one can tune.

328
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,620
But that's impossible.
I thought only you had that ability.

329
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,958
You will process another template
of the subject's memories, yes?

330
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,726
Of course. I'll imprint him again.

331
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:07,817
No. We require them
for a quite different purpose.

332
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,567
It's almost midnight,
Dr. Schreber.

333
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,570
We'll talk again
after tonight's tuning, but...

334
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,405
no more delays, yes?

335
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:20,207
No more inconsistencies
in your behavior.

336
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,809
You appear quite frail, Doctor.

337
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:35,446
Perhaps some exercise
would do you good.

338
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,416
- Come in.
- Kate.

339
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,296
- How is he?
- The same.

340
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,376
Walenski? It's me, Frank.

341
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:08,274
Come in, Frank.

342
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,995
Close the door.

343
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,840
I've been looking through
some of your old reports.

344
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,391
It's an interesting case.

345
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:31,880
The kind that can make
a man's career...

346
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,150
or break it.

347
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,519
Yeah, I was on that case.

348
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,786
And then what?
What happened then, Eddie?

349
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,692
Nothing happened, Frank.

350
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,862
I've just been spending time
on the subway, riding in circles.

351
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,863
Thinking in circles.

352
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,676
There's no way out.

353
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:55,669
I've been over every inch
of this city.

354
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,577
You're scaring your wife
to death, Eddie.

355
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,498
She's not my wife.

356
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,783
I don't know who she is.
I don't know who any of us are.

357
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,752
What makes you say that?

358
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,289
Do you think about
the past much, Frank?

359
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,358
As much as the next guy.

360
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,527
See, I've been trying
to remember things..

361
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,263
clearly remember things
from my past.

362
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:25,736
But the more I try to think back,
the more it all starts to unravel.

363
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,104
None of it seems real.

364
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,507
It's like I've just been
dreaming this life...

365
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,111
and when I finally wake up
I'll be somebody else.

366
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,742
Somebody totally different.

367
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,420
You saw something,
didn't you, Eddie?

368
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,471
Something to do with the case.

369
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,527
There is no case.
There never was!

370
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:54,965
It's all just a big joke!
It's a joke!

371
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,241
Tonight's requirements are...

372
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:43,009
12 family photo albums,
9 personal diaries...

373
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:47,987
17 love letters,
assorted childhood photographs...

374
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:52,155
26 wallets,
ID's and social security cards.

375
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,066
These do bring back memories.

376
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,895
This one is still warm.

377
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,693
What is it?

378
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,967
The recollections of a great lover?

379
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,994
A catalog of conquests?

380
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,318
We will soon find out.

381
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:14,578
<i>You wouldn't appreciate that,
would you, Mr. Whatever your name is?</i>

382
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,849
Not the sort of conquests
you would ever understand.

383
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,017
Let's see.

384
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:25,163
A touch of unhappy childhood.

385
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,615
A dash of teenage rebellion.

386
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,064
And last, but not least...

387
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,403
a tragic death in the family.

388
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,393
Doctor.

389
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,632
Mr. Book.

390
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,884
Why does Murdoch not sleep...

391
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,819
during the tuning as the others do?

392
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,990
I don't know. Maybe he's a step up
the evolutionary ladder.

393
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,893
A freak of nature.
He's adapting to survive.

394
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,329
What do you expect?
Weren't you looking for the human soul?

395
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,932
That's the purpose
of your little zoo, isn't it?

396
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,302
That's why you keep changing people
and things around every night.

397
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,438
Maybe you have finally found
what you are looking for...

398
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:19,179
and it's going
to bite you on your..

399
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,281
It requires several of your lifetimes
to master our gifts.

400
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:28,185
The idea that a simple man
could develop the ability to tune..

401
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,753
Is absurd, I know...

402
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:33,434
but what other
explanation is there?

403
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,618
It is time.

404
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,144
Shut it down.

405
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:43,431
Get your paper right here!

406
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,438
It's driving me crazy.

407
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,906
I can't sleep.

408
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,742
And they call my job "unskilled".

409
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,076
You think you've got it tough?

410
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,846
You try looking after these kids,
for a change.

411
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:07,517
Anyways, Frederickson says he'll
take me off the damn night shift soon.

412
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,388
Well, it's about time, dear.

413
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,185
Hello?

414
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,159
Hello?!

415
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,804
Wake up!

416
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,862
Hey!

417
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,608
Wake up!

418
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,544
Wake up!

419
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,115
Wake up!

420
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,247
Hello?!

421
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,761
Can anybody hear me?!

422
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,218
Let the tuning commence.

423
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,891
The Goodwins.
Jeremy, Sylvia...

424
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,302
Jane and little Matthew.

425
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,408
Jane and little Matthew.

426
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,859
The rich get richer.

427
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:28,760
Probably have maid's quarters
before the night is through.

428
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,091
Dr. Schreber, I presume.

429
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,102
It's you.

430
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,526
Hey, come on.

431
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,796
That's no way to greet
a patient, Doctor.

432
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,598
If that's what you are,
huh, Doctor?

433
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,033
Mr. Murdoch, please, I..

434
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,934
What is happening here?
Why is everyone asleep?

435
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,337
Shh. Please keep your voice down.

436
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,305
Why can't I remember anything?
What have you done to me?

437
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:39,108
Nothing, nothing.
Please, I want to help you.

438
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,443
We can't talk here.

439
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,679
It is not safe.
If they see us together, they'll..

440
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,147
I don't care.
I want some answers.

441
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,515
I want some answers now!

442
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,716
Who are they?

443
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,685
Why are they trying to kill me?

444
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,846
Answer me!

445
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,255
My God. You really can do it.

446
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,592
I did that?

447
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,898
Listen to me, John.
You have their power.

448
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,033
You can make things happen
by will alone.

449
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,370
They call it tuning. That is how
they make the buildings change.

450
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,972
Just now you acted out
of self-defense. A reflex.

451
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,842
But I can teach you to control
your power consciously.

452
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,211
Let me help you, John.
Together we can stop them.

453
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,902
We can take the city back.

454
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,190
My glasses.

455
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,254
My glasses, please.

456
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,071
He made a terrible
impression for the firm...

457
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,440
lollygagging around as he did.

458
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,376
So I simply told Frederickson
I was going to have to let him go.

459
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,412
And well you should have, darling.

460
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,963
He attacked me.

461
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,084
I don't know where he has gone.

462
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,995
Come, Dr. Schreber.

463
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,622
We have much to do.

464
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,386
Yes?

465
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,119
Yes.

466
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:58,708
They say that you're
a run-around lover

467
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,651
Though you say

468
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:06,588
It isn't so

469
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,528
But if you put me down
for another

470
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,098
I'll know

471
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:24,574
Believe me, I'll know

472
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:30,144
'Cause the night

473
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,116
Has a thousand eyes

474
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,954
And a thousand eyes

475
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,254
Can't tell, but see

476
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:51,192
If you are true to me

477
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,964
So remember

478
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:02,707
When you tell those little white lies

479
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:13,179
That the night
has a thousand eyes

480
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:20,627
A thousand eyes

481
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,873
Tonight's experiment shall be conducted
in the following locations.

482
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:35,311
The first subject
shall be imprinted here on Avenue M.

483
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,880
Mr. Book. There is a problem.

484
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,250
There is no Avenue M.
We were unable to complete it.

485
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:45,021
During the last tuning
we detected a lack of control.

486
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,723
An opposing influence
on the machines?

487
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:52,495
Then this man Murdoch
is more powerful than we thought.

488
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,297
He's becoming like us.

489
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:58,860
So we must become like him.

490
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:01,370
The good doctor
has done as we asked?

491
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:06,011
The life and times
of John Murdoch, Volume 2.

492
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,342
We must not do this.

493
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,949
Murdoch does not possess
these memories, yes?

494
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,651
How will his imprint
allow us to find him?

495
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,984
Everywhere he goes...

496
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,690
everyone he seeks out
will be known to us.

497
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:25,728
And as he follows the clues,
so shall we follow the memories.

498
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,431
Perhaps we have forgotten
what happened last time, when we t..

499
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,560
Yes. Poor, poor Mr. ..

500
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,502
We have not forgotten.

501
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:40,773
If Mr. Hand wishes to make this
sacrifice for the greater good...

502
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,845
so be it.

503
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:48,117
But to imprint one of us.
Failure has always resulted.

504
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:51,687
What Mr. Hand proposes
is our only option.

505
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,121
Imprint.

506
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,985
This may sting a bit.

507
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,301
Is it done?

508
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,562
Oh, yes, Mr. Book.

509
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:47,034
I have John Murdoch... in mind.

510
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,009
"Johnny...

511
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,253
"I found this postcard
among your mother's things.

512
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,422
"Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

513
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,288
"Stop by sometime.

514
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,159
"We'll see if we
can't hook ourselves...

515
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,527
"another mermaid.

516
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,758
"Love to Emma. Karl. "

517
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,927
Karl.

518
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,934
Karl Harris.

519
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,613
Harris.

520
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,551
Harris.

521
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,687
"Harris Karl. "

522
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,526
Excuse me. Can you tell
me the way to Avenue C?

523
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,077
Try the subway.

524
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,333
You got a problem, pal?

525
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,269
You been working here long?

526
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:52,478
25 years. No days off
for good behavior.

527
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,929
We're looking for John Murdoch.

528
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,038
She knows nothing, Mr. Hand.

529
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,207
A dead end, yes, Mr. Wall.

530
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,843
We thought his imprint would
allow us to track him, yes...

531
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,312
but instead we have
been brought here.

532
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,980
This is irrational.

533
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,349
Instincts are irrational, Mr. Wall...

534
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,819
and we must follow
where they lead, yes.

535
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,357
Mr. Sleep suggests he may go
to places familiar... his job.

536
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,459
He does not care about our job.

537
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,293
Indulge us, Mr. Hand.

538
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,997
If you were Murdoch..

539
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:22,987
Yes.

540
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,967
If...

541
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,731
I were Murdoch...

542
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,115
I would remember...

543
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:35,277
how my wife had hurt me
by sleeping with another man.

544
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,745
And then...

545
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:43,221
I would look for a way
to hurt her in return.

546
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,057
Leave me alone with her.

547
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,568
There's work to be done.

548
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,650
All change, platform 3.

549
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,498
Platform 3, all change.

550
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,269
All change? Excuse me.

551
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,637
How do I get to the end of the line?

552
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,778
You want the Express.

553
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:14,212
No trains leave on platform 7.

554
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,684
- You want platform 2.
- Got it. Thanks a lot.

555
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,674
Hey!

556
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,220
How come that train didn't stop?

557
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:20,181
That's the Express.

558
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,025
There's no way out, you know?

559
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:26,996
You can't get out of the city.
Believe me, I've tried.

560
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,131
You're Murdoch, aren't you?

561
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,933
The one they've been looking for.

562
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,469
- Who are you?
- Used to be a cop.

563
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,338
At least, in this life, I was.

564
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,974
They steal people's
memories, you know?

565
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,843
Then they swap them around
between us.

566
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,579
I've seen them do it.
Back and forth, back and forth...

567
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,714
till no one knows
who they are anymore.

568
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,016
How do you know all this?

569
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:51,387
Once in a while, one of us wakes up
while they're changing things.

570
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,656
It's not supposed to happen,
but it does.

571
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,682
It happened to me.

572
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,761
They'll come looking for you, Murdoch.

573
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:01,230
Just like they'll come looking for me.

574
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,564
But that's OK.

575
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,665
I figured a way out.

576
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,995
They were here.

577
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,945
Last night.

578
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,493
This was to be his home.

579
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,922
That was when we loved her.

580
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,824
This is all well and good, Mr. Hand...

581
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:35,275
But we require a more practical link
to his present whereabouts.

582
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,227
Yes.

583
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,511
And I know where to find her.

584
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,647
We're very lucky,
when you think about it.

585
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:52,681
I'm sorry?

586
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:57,753
To be able to revisit those places
which have meant so very much to us.

587
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,888
I thought it was more
that we were haunted by them.

588
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,880
Perhaps.

589
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,633
But imagine a life...

590
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,290
alien to yours...

591
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,065
in which your memories
were not your own...

592
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:14,370
but those shared
by every other of your kind.

593
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,707
Imagine the torment
of such an existence...

594
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,938
no experiences to call your own.

595
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,081
If it was all you knew...

596
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,484
maybe it would be a comfort.

597
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:32,421
But if you were to discover
something different...

598
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,788
Something... better.

599
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,563
There used to be a ferry
when I was a boy.

600
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,365
Biggest thing you ever saw.

601
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:47,096
Lit up like a floating birthday cake.

602
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,038
That's just what my husband
once said to me...

603
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,909
on this very spot.

604
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,110
Where is your husband now?

605
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:58,891
I wish I knew.
What brings you here?

606
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,336
I met my wife at this place.

607
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,186
It's where I first met my husband.

608
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,417
Small world.

609
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,606
No, no, no.

610
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:01,776
Hello?

611
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,639
Hello?

612
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,225
What are you doing here?

613
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,686
I've been following you.

614
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,049
Hold it right there!

615
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,302
Johnny?

616
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,501
Johnny!

617
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,840
It's been so damn long...

618
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,443
I thought you'd forgotten
your Uncle Karl.

619
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,274
You son of a gun!

620
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,783
Uncle Karl?

621
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,414
Wait.

622
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,082
Is that me?

623
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,320
Yeah.

624
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,437
Shell Beach is where I grew up?

625
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:36,638
That's what I said.

626
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,041
Shell Beach, your hometown.

627
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:42,277
I need to get there, Karl.
How do I get there?

628
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,905
I don't know.

629
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:47,049
- I haven't been there in years.
- Come on. You must remember.

630
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,117
You gotta have some idea.

631
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,016
Come on!

632
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,097
Sorry, Johnny.

633
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:58,399
The old cracker barrel
ain't what it used to be.

634
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,502
So bright there.

635
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,941
Brighter times, I guess.

636
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,437
You were always scribbling
in that damn book.

637
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,066
That's me and your pa.

638
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:14,337
What a couple of handsome fools.

639
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,264
What happened to my parents?

640
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,510
Where are they now?

641
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,753
They're dead, Johnny.

642
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,222
They died when their house
burnt down.

643
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,183
I looked after you.

644
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:33,089
You don't remember that, really?

645
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,463
What's that?

646
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,900
What is that?

647
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,301
It's a scar.

648
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:49,711
You burnt your arm
pretty bad in the fire.

649
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:59,483
- What does it mean, Johnny?
- It means these are all lies!

650
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,830
Why are you here, Mrs. Murdoch?

651
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:15,401
My husband told me
he'd been here.

652
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:21,576
He told me he wanted
to test himself...

653
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,943
see if he was...

654
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,948
capable of..

655
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:40,162
I wanted to talk to her. I thought maybe
she could help me find him.

656
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:44,123
Stay here.
I'm gonna call the station.

657
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:59,448
Yeah, this is Bumstead. Send the
homicide coroner to 1440-East, yeah.

658
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,179
There's been another one.

659
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:07,818
It's the same pattern.
I'll explain when you get here.

660
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,426
Oh, God.

661
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,068
It's OK. I won't hurt you.

662
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,593
It's OK.

663
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,715
Where the hell did she come from?

664
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,676
I found her hiding.

665
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:38,682
She saw what happened here.

666
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:07,949
Are you ready to go home,
Mrs. Murdoch?

667
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,860
The inspector is gonna take me. Thanks.

668
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:37,061
It's beautiful.

669
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,647
It was a gift from my mother.

670
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:45,210
She died recently.

671
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:49,314
I keep it with me
to remind me of her.

672
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,857
I'm sorry.

673
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,498
It's a funny thing, though.

674
01:03:56,499 --> 01:04:00,739
I can't remember
when she gave it to me.

675
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:06,608
How do you think I could
forget a thing like that?

676
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:11,429
Do you think about the past much,
Mrs. Murdoch?

677
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,719
What's happening, Inspector?

678
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,671
I'm not sure I know anymore.

679
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,593
I left your old room like it was.

680
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,761
You can sleep here tonight, huh?

681
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,097
Glad to have you back, Johnny...

682
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,832
even if it is for just a night.

683
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:31,822
Karl.

684
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,236
Is that the right time?

685
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:38,173
Why, sure. That clock's
kept perfect time since I bought it.

686
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,971
A.m. or p. m.?

687
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,611
What do you think, Johnny?

688
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,646
I don't understand.
How can it be night already?

689
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,381
What happened to the day?
How'd I miss it?

690
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,284
You're tired. Anything's possible.

691
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,684
Look...

692
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:56,310
get some sleep. We'll straighten
all this out tomorrow.

693
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:24,419
<i>"Guide to Shell Beach
by Johnny Murdoch. "</i>

694
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,853
Oh, come on.

695
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,877
- Hello?
- Emma, he's here.

696
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:51,046
He's acting mighty peculiar.

697
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,148
I know. He's not himself.

698
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,116
Keep him there,
and I'll be right over.

699
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:58,437
- I'll try.
- Thanks, Karl. Bye.

700
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,081
Johnny.

701
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,024
I can't promise anything,
Mrs. Murdoch.

702
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,626
We just have to play it as it comes.

703
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:08,119
Johnny, we just wanted to help.

704
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,905
Karl.

705
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,338
Uncle Karl.

706
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:21,320
Johnny, if you're in
some kind of trouble...

707
01:06:21,321 --> 01:06:23,545
well, maybe we could do something.

708
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:26,381
Haven't seen you in so long.

709
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,940
Yes.

710
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:46,089
Mr. Murdoch... you've been
the cause of much distress.

711
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,500
- Start talking.
- There's no need for this.

712
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:53,902
There's no escape.

713
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,937
The city's ours. We made it.

714
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,472
What are you talking about?

715
01:07:57,473 --> 01:08:00,708
We fashioned this city
on stolen memories...

716
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:04,579
different eras, different pasts
all rolled into one.

717
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,115
Each night, we revise it, refine it...

718
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,650
in order to learn.

719
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,050
Learn what?

720
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,586
About you, Mr. Murdoch...

721
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,888
you and your fellow inhabitants...

722
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:16,029
what makes you human.

723
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:19,685
- Why?!
- We need to be like you.

724
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:22,630
I understand you now, Mr. Murdoch.

725
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:26,234
I remember that which you do not...
what you've been missing.

726
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,965
The ocean, yes...

727
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,606
running along the waves as a child...

728
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:37,145
meeting Emma at the river...
That first kiss that followed.

729
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:38,346
What are you?

730
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,148
You've seen what we are.

731
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:43,084
We use your dead as vessels.

732
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:53,770
Get in!

733
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,799
What about her? Ring any bells?

734
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,167
She was alive when I left her.

735
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:14,302
What about this?

736
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,371
This is nothing. This is..

737
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,706
It must mean something,
all those pictures.

738
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:20,117
What pictures?

739
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:21,943
I don't understand this.

740
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,812
Stop playing games with me, Murdoch!
Stop telling me lies!

741
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,347
I am not telling you lies!

742
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,783
Help me out here.
Make me understand.

743
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,918
I have this jigsaw puzzle
in front of my face...

744
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,955
and every time I try to rearrange the
pieces, it still doesn't make any sense.

745
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,356
You think it makes sense to me?

746
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:37,458
I'm as much in the dark here
as you are.

747
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,559
You let me ask you a question?

748
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,163
You heard of a place
called Shell Beach?

749
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:44,699
- Sure.
- You know how to get there?

750
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,167
- Yeah.
- You tell me?

751
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:50,298
All right. You just..
You go to the...

752
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,307
Where? Where do you go?

753
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,498
Just give me a second, will ya?

754
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:59,448
You can't remember, can you?

755
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:03,559
You think that's kind of odd?

756
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:05,008
Wait.

757
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,487
I got a better one for you.

758
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,822
When was the last time...

759
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,725
you remember doing
something during the day?

760
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:11,859
What do you mean?

761
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,910
I just mean... during the day.

762
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,190
Daylight.

763
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,832
When was the last time
you remember seeing it?

764
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:21,636
And I'm not talking about some distant,
half-forgotten childhood memory.

765
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:24,806
I mean like yesterday?
Last week? When?

766
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:28,677
Can you come up
with a single memory?

767
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,044
You can't, can you?

768
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:33,348
You know something?
I don't think the sun even...

769
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,045
exists... in this place.

770
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:41,122
'Cause I've been up for hours and hours
and hours and the night never ends here.

771
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,791
- That is crazy.
- You're damn right this is crazy.

772
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,194
Listen to me, Bumstead.
It's not just me.

773
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,220
It's all of us.

774
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,864
They're doing something to all of us.

775
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,667
- Shut up, I've heard enough.
- Please listen.

776
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:57,218
- Shut up, will ya! Shut up!
- Listen to me.

777
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:09,736
There has to be an explanation
for this somewhere.

778
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,389
Explain this.

779
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,208
John, I'm so sorry.

780
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,050
I never meant to hurt you, John...

781
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,218
and I did it,
and I don't know why I did.

782
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,421
I wish I could take it all back.

783
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,990
No. Emma... You didn't do it.

784
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,793
This... affair of yours,
whatever it is...

785
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,461
the thing you're
supposed to have done...

786
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,363
you didn't do it.
I don't believe it ever happened.

787
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,798
What do you mean?

788
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,200
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

789
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:02,136
but what if we never
knew each other before now?

790
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:04,605
What if the first time we ever met...

791
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:08,476
was last night in your..
in our apartment...

792
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,427
and everything you remember...

793
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,315
and everything that I'm supposed
to remember never really happened?

794
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:18,186
Someone just wants us to think it did.

795
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,259
You know, back in the apartment...

796
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:29,497
I suddenly felt like
I didn't know you at all.

797
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:32,918
It was as if you were a stranger.

798
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,604
But how can that be true?

799
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:40,735
I so vividly remember meeting you.

800
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:44,416
I remember falling in love with you.

801
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,814
I remember losing you.

802
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:47,915
Time's up.

803
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:50,718
No, wait, wait.

804
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,846
Please, just...

805
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,028
just one more minute.

806
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,623
I love you, John.

807
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:09,017
You can't fake something like that.

808
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,647
No, you can't.

809
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,562
Inspector? Sir?

810
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,574
Detective Walenski
killed himself last night.

811
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:50,395
I... kind of thought
you should know.

812
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:56,817
Oh, and...
the chief wanted to see you.

813
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:57,978
Sir...

814
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:08,159
I knew you'd track the killer down, sir.

815
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:19,763
Sir...

816
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,734
shoelace.

817
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,191
How can we help you, sir?

818
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:39,558
You can sleep.

819
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:42,697
Gentlemen..

820
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,289
Sleep. Sleep.

821
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,256
Evening, sir.

822
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,138
Bumstead.

823
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:08,289
I wanted to be the first
to congratulate you... about the case.

824
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,088
Take us to Murdoch.

825
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,218
Sleep.

826
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,220
Dr. Schreber.

827
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,191
I knew you'd come eventually.

828
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:46,927
Don't you think it's about time
you started giving me some answers?

829
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,123
Yes. Yes, of course.

830
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,854
Won't you please sit down?

831
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,070
I come here quite often.

832
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,572
It's one of the few places
I'm allowed a moment's peace.

833
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:02,713
You see,
they have an aversion to water.

834
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:05,613
One could almost call it a phobia.

835
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,916
Who are they?
What do they want from me?

836
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,475
Right.

837
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,620
Well, for now, let's just say...

838
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:15,356
that you were the subject
of their experiment.

839
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:16,722
We all are.

840
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,397
You're not crazy, John.

841
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:24,510
And you are not a murderer.

842
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,201
I'm sorry about this. I truly am.

843
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:28,769
But we do not have much time...

844
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,439
and I cannot afford the luxury
of doing this the right way.

845
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,007
Everything you need to know...

846
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,376
all the answers
are in this syringe.

847
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,610
I need you to inject yourself.

848
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:39,046
It's the only way to
make you understand.

849
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:40,381
You're kidding me, right?

850
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,951
We're running out of time, John.
You have to do this now.

851
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,453
Give me the gun, Doctor.

852
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,922
Inspector, he is more
disturbed than we thought.

853
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,691
I may not be the judge of personality
that you are, Doctor...

854
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:54,562
but you're the one
who looks disturbed to me.

855
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,565
You do not know
what you are doing.

856
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:01,161
What, exactly is in this... Doctor?

857
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,139
All the answers you've
been looking for, John.

858
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,740
I swear to you.

859
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:12,880
Guess I'll just have to
hold on to it for... safekeeping.

860
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,115
If you don't mind.

861
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,896
Let's go, Doctor.

862
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:22,188
- Go? Where are we going?
- Shell Beach.

863
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,626
That's where you want to go, isn't it?

864
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:27,219
The ocean.

865
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,641
Why are you doing this?

866
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,142
What do you hope to gain by helping me?

867
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,701
The truth.

868
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,480
None of these maps extend far enough
to show the ocean.

869
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:47,915
You won't find anything there...

870
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,884
I promise you!
I've been there, and..

871
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:53,554
If you've been there, you can
show us the way, then, can't you?

872
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:56,015
We'll see for ourselves.

873
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:57,215
I won't.

874
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:02,313
I refuse.
You can't make me go there!

875
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:15,785
You were saying, doctor?

876
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:31,979
I don't understand.
Used to be a bridge here.

877
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,200
Try that again,
your friends are gonna be...

878
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,568
fishing you out of the canal.

879
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,002
Just don't hurt me.
I'll tell you everything.

880
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:45,323
It doesn't matter anymore anyway.

881
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,139
What?

882
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:57,181
Who are you people?

883
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:06,327
We will give you some more
pretty things soon... Anna.

884
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:07,748
I'm not Anna.

885
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,677
You will be soon, yes.

886
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,740
I have another use for her first.

887
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:30,179
First there was darkness.
Then came the strangers.

888
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:35,923
They abducted us
and brought us here.

889
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:38,726
This city, everyone in it...

890
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,127
is their experiment.

891
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:43,063
They mix and match
our memories as they see fit...

892
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:46,533
trying to divine
what makes us unique.

893
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,336
One day, a man
might be an inspector.

894
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:52,273
The next, someone entirely different.

895
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:55,609
When they want to
study a murderer for instance...

896
01:21:55,610 --> 01:22:00,547
they simply imprint one of their
citizens with a new personality...

897
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:05,386
arrange a family for him,
friends, an entire history...

898
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:07,021
even a lost wallet.

899
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:10,022
Then they observe the results.

900
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:14,261
Will a man, given the history
of a killer, continue in that vein?

901
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:18,299
Or are we, in fact, more
than the mere sum of our memories?

902
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:23,337
This business of you being a killer
was an unhappy coincidence.

903
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:26,240
You have had dozens
of lives before now.

904
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:30,344
You just happened to wake up while
I was imprinting you with this one.

905
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,513
Why are they doing all of this?

906
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,950
It is our capacity for individuality...

907
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,552
our souls that makes
us different from them.

908
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:40,955
They think they
can find the human soul...

909
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:44,124
if they understand
how our memories work.

910
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,426
All they have
are collective memories.

911
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,260
They share one group mind.

912
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:49,797
They're dying, you see?

913
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:53,267
Their entire race
is on the brink of extinction.

914
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:55,169
They think we can save them.

915
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:58,238
- Where do I fit in?
- You are different, John.

916
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:02,239
You resisted my attempt
to imprint you.

917
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:09,149
Somehow you have developed
their ability to tune.

918
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,484
That is how they change things.

919
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,052
That is how they built this city.

920
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:14,989
They have machines buried deep
beneath the surface...

921
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:19,793
that allow them
to focus their telepathic energies.

922
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:22,329
They control everything here,
even the sun.

923
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,699
That's why it's always dark.
They can't stand the light.

924
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,001
So why do they need you?

925
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:31,438
When they first brought us here,
they extracted what was in us.

926
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:35,309
So they could store the information,
remix it like so much paint...

927
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,878
and give us back new memories
of their choosing.

928
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:42,519
But they still needed an artist
to help them.

929
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:46,553
I understood the intricacies
of the human mind...

930
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:49,123
better than they ever could...

931
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,892
so they allowed me
to keep my skills as a scientist...

932
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:53,360
because they needed them.

933
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:57,451
But they made me
delete everything else.

934
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:07,074
Can you imagine what
it is like being forced...

935
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,842
to erase your own past?

936
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:13,080
What about my past?
What about my childhood?

937
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,777
Shell Beach, Uncle Karl.

938
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,191
What about this?

939
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,687
This was blank when I found it!

940
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,756
You still don't understand, John.

941
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,993
You were never a boy...
not in this place.

942
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:28,829
Your entire history is an illusion,
a fabrication...

943
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,731
as it is with all of us.

944
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,267
You made those drawings
happen with your gift.

945
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:36,228
You say they brought us here.

946
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:38,098
From where?

947
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,010
I'm sorry.

948
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,859
I don't remember.

949
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,315
None of us remember that...

950
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,950
what we once were...

951
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:52,419
what we might have been...

952
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,920
somewhere else.

953
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,273
I've taken you this far.

954
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,442
You don't need me anymore.

955
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,240
Let's go.

956
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,260
John.

957
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:04,154
There is no ocean, John.

958
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:08,322
There is nothing beyond the city.

959
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:11,696
The only place home exists...

960
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:15,526
is in your head.

961
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,608
No! No!

962
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,478
John, stop!

963
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:31,177
No!

964
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,185
Stop!

965
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,056
Please!

966
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:44,091
No!

967
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:05,364
And now you know the truth.

968
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:25,367
No!

969
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:16,323
You'll allow yourself
to surrender, Mr. Murdoch...

970
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,592
or it will result in
this one's death, yes?

971
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:21,161
What do I care?
She's not my real wife!

972
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,329
She's nothing to me!

973
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:26,600
But you do still care,
don't you, Mr. Murdoch?

974
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:29,303
You see, I have
become the monster...

975
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,764
you were intended to be.

976
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:37,617
Shall I end her life now
as you would have?

977
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:42,316
Don't hurt her, please!

978
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:46,947
Then surrender, Mr. Murdoch.

979
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,615
Sleep.

980
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:52,653
Now.

981
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,156
John?

982
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,339
Sleep.

983
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:37,437
The doctor was right.
He has evolved.

984
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:38,962
Kill him.

985
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:41,056
Kill him!
Kill him!

986
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,509
Kill him! Kill him!

987
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:52,709
He is powerful, yes.

988
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:57,257
Dangerous. But he can also
lead us to what we seek.

989
01:29:57,258 --> 01:30:00,659
What the doctor calls the soul.

990
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:04,431
It is time for our experiment
to move into a final phase.

991
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:07,200
We no longer need
the other subjects.

992
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:10,830
The time for study is over.

993
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:15,070
It is time to be one
with John Murdoch.

994
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,617
It is time, Doctor.

995
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:25,176
Imprint.

996
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:30,719
Shut it down!

997
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:33,921
Shut it down forever!

998
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:50,073
What are you doing?

999
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:55,982
They want to imprint you
with their own collective memories.

1000
01:30:55,983 --> 01:31:02,493
They want to make you one of them,
so they can share your soul.

1001
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:08,628
Imprint, Doctor.
No more disobedience.

1002
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:10,460
I'm sorry, John.

1003
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:13,868
The pain will only last a moment.

1004
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:16,603
No!

1005
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,512
Remember, John.

1006
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:29,583
You'll rise to greater
heights than that, my boy.

1007
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:33,119
One day when you're older,
you'll understand.

1008
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,485
Remember.

1009
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:38,458
That's it, John.
Practice makes perfect.

1010
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:41,695
Now remember what I told you.
Never talk to strangers.

1011
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,493
John, remember.

1012
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:46,433
You're probably wondering why I keep
appearing in your memories.

1013
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:49,002
It is because I have
inserted myself in them.

1014
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:51,137
All of these memories
have been fabricated...

1015
01:31:51,138 --> 01:31:52,873
to teach you about the strangers.

1016
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:58,284
Give you a lifetime of knowledge
in a single syringe.

1017
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:01,212
You will survive, John.

1018
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:03,583
You will find strength
within yourself...

1019
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:05,585
and you will prevail.

1020
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:06,951
Remember.

1021
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:08,755
Hi, Uncle Karl.

1022
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:09,745
Johnny!

1023
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,895
You're getting the hang of it, John.

1024
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:17,764
Maybe one day
I'll be working for you.

1025
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:21,034
This is the machine the strangers use
to amplify their thoughts.

1026
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:22,936
The machine
that changes their world.

1027
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,538
You must take control of it.

1028
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,206
You must make the machine yours.

1029
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,375
I know you can beat them, John.

1030
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,876
But you must concentrate.

1031
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,900
Something's wrong.

1032
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:45,592
There is no time for romance, John.

1033
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:47,961
The world can be what you make it.

1034
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:49,987
What have you done?

1035
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:52,599
You have the power
to make anything happen...

1036
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,790
but you must act now!

1037
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:40,486
I knew you could do it, John.

1038
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:42,555
You have their power now.

1039
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:44,457
You control their machines.

1040
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:45,857
Where's Emma?

1041
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:49,462
She is not Emma anymore, John.

1042
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:50,897
She has been reimprinted.

1043
01:37:50,898 --> 01:37:52,632
So give her back her memories.

1044
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:55,101
I can't. The facility
where the strangers...

1045
01:37:55,102 --> 01:37:58,137
stored the memories
has been destroyed.

1046
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:00,299
I'm sorry.

1047
01:38:00,341 --> 01:38:03,941
What are you going to do now, John?

1048
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:08,982
You told me I had
the power, didn't you?

1049
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:13,119
I can make these machines
do anything I want.

1050
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,489
Make this world anything
I want it to be.

1051
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:20,810
Just so long as I concentrate
hard enough.

1052
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:46,428
Where are you going?

1053
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:50,183
Shell Beach.

1054
01:40:31,058 --> 01:40:34,058
- What's the fare?
- Quarter.

1055
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:39,732
Oh, please.

1056
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:42,258
- Oh, no..
- It's fine.

1057
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:44,212
- Thank you.
- OK.

1058
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:25,776
John...

1059
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:31,989
Been waiting for you, yes?

1060
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:33,419
What are you doing?

1061
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:36,823
I'm just making a few little changes
around here, is all.

1062
01:41:36,824 --> 01:41:39,025
Are we sure that's what we want?

1063
01:41:39,026 --> 01:41:41,494
I'm prepared to take my chances.

1064
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:43,096
I'm dying, John.

1065
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:47,500
Your imprint is not
agreeable with my kind.

1066
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:51,137
But I wanted to know
what it was like...

1067
01:41:51,138 --> 01:41:52,605
how you feel.

1068
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,374
You know how I was
supposed to feel.

1069
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:59,175
That person isn't me.
Never was.

1070
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:04,317
You wanted to know what it was
about us that made us human.

1071
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:09,008
Well, you're not going
to find it... in here.

1072
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:13,153
You went looking
in the wrong place.

1073
01:43:50,424 --> 01:43:52,794
It's so beautiful here.

1074
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:59,131
So bright.

1075
01:44:05,038 --> 01:44:07,907
Do you know if Shell Beach
is around here?

1076
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:11,418
I think that's it just over there.

1077
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:31,475
I'm headed that way myself.

1078
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:35,389
Would you like to join me?

1079
01:44:36,903 --> 01:44:37,892
Sure.

1080
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:45,942
I'm Anna, by the way.

1081
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:48,799
- What's your name?
- John.

1082
01:44:50,651 --> 01:44:52,118
John Murdoch.

1083
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:44,576
<i>When marimba rhythms
start to play</i>

1084
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:47,136
<i>Dance with me</i>

1085
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:49,774
<i>Make me sway</i>

1086
01:49:49,816 --> 01:49:54,185
<i>Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore</i>

1087
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,279
<i>Hold me close</i>

1088
01:49:56,323 --> 01:49:59,315
<i>Sway me more</i>

1089
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:03,489
<i>Like a flower
bending in the breeze</i>

1090
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,828
<i>Bend with me</i>

1091
01:50:05,865 --> 01:50:08,834
<i>Sway with ease</i>

1092
01:50:08,868 --> 01:50:13,168
<i>When we dance
you have a way with me</i>

1093
01:50:13,206 --> 01:50:15,197
<i>Stay with me</i>

1094
01:50:15,241 --> 01:50:18,108
<i>Sway with me</i>

1095
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:22,911
<i>Other dancers may be on the floor</i>

1096
01:50:22,949 --> 01:50:27,648
<i>Dear, but my eyes will see only you</i>

1097
01:50:27,687 --> 01:50:32,386
<i>Only you have that
magic technique</i>

1098
01:50:32,425 --> 01:50:37,055
<i>When we sway I go weak</i>

1099
01:50:37,097 --> 01:50:41,056
<i>I can hear the sound of violins</i>

1100
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:46,368
<i>Long before it begins</i>

1101
01:50:46,406 --> 01:50:50,536
<i>Make me thrill
as only you know how</i>

1102
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:56,743
<i>Sway me smooth, sway me now</i>

1103
01:50:56,783 --> 01:51:01,846
<i>Sway me now</i>

1104
01:51:04,591 --> 01:51:07,958
<i>Sway me smooth</i>

1105
01:51:13,566 --> 01:51:19,505
<i>Sway me now</i>
