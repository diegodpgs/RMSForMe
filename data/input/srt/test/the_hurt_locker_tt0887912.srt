1
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:53,565
Approaching.

2
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:03,435
I think we have touchdown.

3
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:11,095
Little to the right.

4
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:34,345
Hello, mum.

5
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:40,145
Now, push it in.

6
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:43,925
I can't.

7
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:46,555
What do you mean you can't?
Pretend it's your dick, man.

8
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:48,095
How about I pretend it's your dick?

9
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:50,435
You'll never get in if you did that.

10
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:52,855
Here. Let me have a shot.
- Give me a second.

11
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:55,590
No, come on. My dick, man.
- Go.

12
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,215
Fucker.

13
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,635
Got that.
- Yeah.

14
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:11,845
Here we go.

15
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:19,003
Oh, look at that.
- Nice 155, huh?

16
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:20,505
Yeah.

17
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:23,635
It's going to do some fucking damage.

18
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:26,885
Hey, Eldridge, looks like
we're going to need a charge.

19
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:28,215
I got that.

20
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:32,265
Figured four blocks that'll
give us about 20 pounds of bang total.

21
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:35,225
That blast is going to
roast straight out there.

22
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:37,275
The shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnel...

23
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,735
...is going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern.

24
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,565
Yep.

25
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:44,195
We're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way.

26
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:46,235
but we'll be okay
if we're behind the Humvee.

27
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:50,585
Bring the bot back, we'll load it up.
- No problem.

28
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:53,305
Bot is moving.

29
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,965
Let me know what you got, Eldridge.

30
00:04:10,065 --> 00:04:10,715
Good to go.

31
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:13,960
All right. Wagon's set up. Bot moves.

32
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,055
Uh-oh. We got goats, guys.

33
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:20,155
Goats 12:00. Watch out.

34
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:22,960
Load them little bastards up.

35
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:40,765
Oh, shit.
- Shit.

36
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:43,755
Oh, fuck.

37
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:45,875
Wagon's having a bad day, boys.

38
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:48,135
You build that?
- No, the U.S. Army did.

39
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:50,385
All right. Looks like I'm going down there.

40
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:52,425
You don't like waiting around
this beautiful neighborhood?

41
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,525
Oh, I love it.

42
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:06,275
So, if everything looks okay.
when I get down there

43
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,195
I'm just going to set it up and bip it.

44
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:10,815
Give these people
something to think about.

45
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:13,115
Want them to know if they're gonna leave
a bomb on the side of the road for us.

46
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:14,865
we're just going to blow up
their little fuckin' road.

47
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,965
Sounds good.

48
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,245
Craving a burger; is that strange?

49
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:21,345
Not for you.
- No, okay.

50
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:23,385
Helmet on.

51
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:25,685
Happy trails.

52
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:34,885
Blaster One, can you read me?

53
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,555
Roger that, Blaster one.
You're good to go.

54
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:46,050
You're looking good, Blaster One.

55
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:06,975
Nice and hot in here.

56
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:14,715
One fifty.

57
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:16,815
Roger that, 150 meters

58
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:31,895
Hi.

59
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:33,815
Where are you from?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

60
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:35,855
Where are you from?
Where are you from?

61
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:36,775
California?

62
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,235
Hey, get out of here, man.
- Where?

63
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,405
Hey, this ain't no fuckin' meet
and greet. Now get out of here.

64
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:43,505
Now.

65
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,805
Go.

66
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:57,925
You making friends again, Sanborn?

67
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,025
All day long.

68
00:07:06,155 --> 00:07:07,595
Twenty-five.

69
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:12,795
Twenty-five meters. Roger that.
You are now in the kill zone.

70
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,865
Thanks for reminding me.

71
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:17,550
That's what I'm here for, baby.

72
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,125
Okay-

73
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,755
The debts look good.

74
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:32,175
Roger that.

75
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:03,540
I'm laying on the charge...

76
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:06,045
Nice and sweet.

77
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:09,175
We're good to go.

78
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:11,345
I'm coming back.

79
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:16,205
Five meters out.
- Five meters. Roger that.

80
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:17,455
Hey, Sanborn...

81
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:21,550
You know what this place needs?
- I'm listening.

82
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:23,605
Needs grass.

83
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,255
We gonna start our grass business?

84
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:27,885
That's right, man

85
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:32,320
I'm going to sell the grass,
you're going to cut it.

86
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:36,350
It's going to be called 'Sanborn and Sons'.

87
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,615
We'll be rich.

88
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:42,985
I like that. Crabgrass,
St. Augustine, man.

89
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,155
I'm a scholar on this shit.

90
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:49,245
How about this?
You sell it, I fertilize it.

91
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:53,205
25.
- 25 meters. Roger that.

92
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,495
Sanborn.

93
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:58,075
Butcher shop, 2:00,
dude has a phone.

94
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:00,035
Why is Eldridge running?

95
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,585
Make him put it down.
- Put down the phone.

96
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:04,335
Come on, guys. Talk to me.

97
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:07,070
Drop the phone.
Drop your phone.

98
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:09,465
Hey, burn him, Eldridge. Burn him.

99
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:12,255
Put down the cell phone.
- Eldridge, burn him.

100
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:13,845
Get out of the way.
- Drop your phone.

101
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:16,580
Make him put it down.
Go get it.

102
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:20,690
Come on, Eldridge.
- I can't get him in sight.

103
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:37,635
Thompson.

104
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,245
Anywhere's good.

105
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:31,265
Is that everything?
- Yeah.

106
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,135
Yeah?

107
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:14,475
Come in.

108
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:17,815
Sergeant James.

109
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:22,465
JT Sanborn, my man.

110
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:24,515
Hey. Hi, how are you? Will.
I'm Will.

111
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:26,595
Welcome to Bravo Company;
welcome to Camp Victory.

112
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:29,265
Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty.

113
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:32,145
Oh, no. They changed
that about a week ago.

114
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:34,245
Victory sounds better.

115
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:36,748
All right. Well, at least
I'm in the right place, right?

116
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:37,065
Yeah.

117
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:39,105
While you're here, can you help me
move this thing real quick?

118
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:40,195
Yeah, no problem.

119
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:42,325
Maybe you shouldn't take this down.

120
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:43,945
We get a lot of mortars at night.

121
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:47,245
The plywood on the windows help
with the lateral fray coming through.

122
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:48,415
That's why it's up there.

123
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,995
Yeah, well, it's not going
to stop a mortar round...

124
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:52,995
...from coming in through
the roof, you know.

125
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,885
Besides, I like the sunshine.

126
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:59,465
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson.

127
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:02,715
I know he was a good tech.
- Yeah, he was.

128
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,305
He was a great team leader too.

129
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:07,265
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fill his shoes or anything.

130
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:09,635
I'm just...
I'm just going to do my best.

131
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:12,105
Appreciate it.
- All right.

132
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:14,575
Cool.

133
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:19,075
Home sweet home, right?

134
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,865
Aren't you glad the Army has
all these tanks parked here?

135
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,865
Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battle.

136
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:35,705
I'd rather be on the side with the tanks,
just in case, rather than not have them.

137
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,455
Yeah, but they don't do anything.

138
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:40,755
Anyone comes alongside
a Humvee we're dead.

139
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:42,965
Anybody even looks
at you funny we're dead.

140
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,755
Pretty much the bottom line is
if you're in lraq, you're dead.

141
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:47,555
How's a fuckin' tank supposed to stop that?

142
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:50,375
Would you shut up, Owen?
- Sorry.

143
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,975
Just trying to scare the new guy.

144
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:56,305
I saw a little bit in Afghanistan too.

145
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:08,495
Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge.
- Copy that.

146
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:14,615
Move.

147
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:16,715
Move.

148
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:54,905
Blaster One, this is Victory Main.

149
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:58,320
Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over.

150
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:11,305
Where the hell are the guys
who called this in?

151
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:28,395
Victory Main, Victory Main.
this is Blaster Mike.

152
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:33,085
Interrogative, do you have
an update on position? Over.

153
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:39,995
Victory Main, figures to follow.
Three-four-five-three is your grid.

154
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:49,545
Well, that's exactly where the hell I am
and I don't see anybody in fatigues.

155
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:52,025
Give us a second to confirm.

156
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,005
Watch your feet.

157
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:57,595
Set visual is three-four five-three.

158
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,315
Got the Humvee.

159
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,905
Friendly.

160
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:09,285
Friendly.

161
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:27,635
Ah, here we go.

162
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:30,165
They abandoned their vehicle.

163
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:32,795
We got an empty Humvee
over here, James.

164
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:34,895
Yeah, I got it.

165
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:39,935
Let's move.

166
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,405
Friendly.

167
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:49,365
Morning, boys.
- Sir.

168
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:52,475
Don't tell me the bomb's
in here with you guys.

169
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,025
Step out and I'll show you what's going on.
- All right.

170
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,105
Down on that block 20 meters,

171
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:59,195
this side of the mosque.
east side of the street.

172
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,195
our informant says he saw a pair of wires...

173
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,785
...going into a rubble pile.

174
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:04,785
It's a possible lED.
- Yeah.

175
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:06,655
I trust this guy, I know him.
- Okay.

176
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:08,426
I'll handle it.
- Do you want to talk him or...

177
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:08,615
No.

178
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:11,785
Good. Keep your boys back.
We'll be good. Thank you.

179
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:13,745
Specialist, bring up the Humvee.

180
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:14,585
What's going on?

181
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:17,295
I'm going to break out the suit.

182
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:19,715
What about the bot?
- I'll take care of it.

183
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:21,715
Don't you want to send the bot down
there to see what it looks like?

184
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:22,795
I'll handle it.

185
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:26,125
That's kind of tight down here, James.

186
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,665
Ready?

187
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,505
Good?

188
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:59,715
You don't have to go down there.
We already have the bot halfway up.

189
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:01,815
I'll be all right.

190
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:16,030
First day, figure you want
to take it easy, right?

191
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,775
How's it looking, Eldridge?

192
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,000
Good to go.
- Let's do it.

193
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:36,665
Got two of 'em?
- Got two.

194
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,825
All right, Let's rock and roll, man.

195
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:00,210
He's a rowdy boy.
- He's reckless.

196
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,390
Blaster One, what's going on?

197
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:18,525
Blaster One. What are you doing?

198
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:20,995
Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike.

199
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:24,920
What's with the smoke
on the side of the road?

200
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:27,465
Hey, James, can you hear me?

201
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:32,255
What's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? Over.

202
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:33,595
Creating a diversion

203
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,715
From what? Is there a threat?

204
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,790
Eldridge, get up on the wall, Move.

205
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:42,960
Tell me what you see, specialist.

206
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:45,225
All right, I got him.

207
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,355
He's walking down range.

208
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:49,025
James, the smoke is killing my visibility.

209
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:53,275
Where are you in relationship to the IED?
Are you within 100 meters yet?

210
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:59,410
Hell, I don't know, but I'll tell you
when I'm standing over it, cowboy.

211
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,915
Take cover.

212
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:44,115
Oh, no. A car stopped
in front of him, Sanborn

213
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,915
Shit, James. James, come back now.

214
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:50,415
EOD pulled a nine on this Haji in a car.

215
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:53,755
Want me to send backup?

216
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:55,125
I got it.

217
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:57,775
Get here.
- Negative. Negative.

218
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:58,845
Stand down.

219
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:01,015
The blast will come up the block.

220
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:02,765
Stay clear around the corner.

221
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:06,435
EOD has the situation under control, over.

222
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,275
Where you going?

223
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,325
Want to back up?

224
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:19,045
Get out of the car.

225
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:22,300
Get out of the car.
- Come on.

226
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:27,725
What the fuck are you doing?

227
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,345
Back up.

228
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:37,475
Hello?

229
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:53,905
Want to get back?

230
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,845
It's that way.

231
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:22,935
Back.

232
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:43,155
Taxi's moving.

233
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:45,995
Get out of the car.
Stop.

234
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:55,005
Stay down.

235
00:21:57,975 --> 00:22:01,665
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent,
he sure the hell is now.

236
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:04,315
Roger that. That's real funny.

237
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:00,535
Got something.

238
00:23:11,295 --> 00:23:13,295
Oh, baby.

239
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,405
Gotcha.

240
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:02,215
All right.

241
00:24:06,635 --> 00:24:08,635
We're done.

242
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:12,965
Good to go.

243
00:24:13,015 --> 00:24:15,015
Come down, specialist.

244
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:18,025
Roger.

245
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:33,665
Got a wire.

246
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:36,205
Hang on.

247
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:43,005
Where are you going?

248
00:24:57,645 --> 00:24:59,045
Secondary.

249
00:24:59,145 --> 00:24:59,835
Shit.

250
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:03,675
Take cover. Get in the wall.
Get in the wall.

251
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:51,155
That wasn't so bad. First time working
together. What do you think?

252
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:57,045
I think us working together means
I talk to you and you talk to me.

253
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:00,535
We going on a date, Sanborn?
- No.

254
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:02,125
We're going on a mission.

255
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:05,375
and my job is to keep you safe
so we can keep going on missions.

256
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:07,475
It's combat, buddy.

257
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:15,725
Hey.

258
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,345
It's just 39 days.

259
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:20,250
Thirty-eight if we survive today.

260
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:40,075
Hey, it's 'Mr. Be All You Can Be'.

261
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:41,415
What's up, doc?

262
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:43,515
Not much. How are you?

263
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:45,725
I'm good.

264
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:50,795
Got a question about that
song, 'Be All You Can Be'.

265
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:54,135
What if all I can be is dead
on the side of an Iraqi road?

266
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:55,555
I mean, I think it's logical.

267
00:27:55,655 --> 00:28:00,855
This is war. People die
all the time. Why not me?

268
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:03,355
You got to change the record in our head.

269
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:05,265
You gotta start thinking about other things.

270
00:28:05,365 --> 00:28:07,565
Okay.
Stop obsessing... Right now.

271
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:09,435
What are you thinking about?

272
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:11,936
You want to know
what I'm thinking about, doc?

273
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:12,275
Yeah.

274
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:15,520
This is what I'm thinking about, doc.

275
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:19,745
Here's Thompson, okay.
He's dead. He's alive.

276
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:24,035
Here's Thompson.
He's dead. He's alive.

277
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:26,925
He's dead. He's alive.

278
00:28:32,725 --> 00:28:35,005
Yo, what's up, my nigger?
What's up, man? You cool?

279
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:38,055
Come on. You want the cool shit?
Come on, come on. It's the tight shit, man.

280
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:40,605
Wanna buy DVD?
Wanna buy DVD?

281
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:43,055
Fuck you.
Come, come, please, please.

282
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,385
New releases. Look.

283
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:47,305
Hello, Hello.
Want to buy DVDs? Very good, Very good.

284
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:48,015
How much?

285
00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:49,515
One for five and two for nine.

286
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:50,935
Three for twelve.

287
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:53,645
Three for thirteen and I don't
give you tax, Very good, man, Look.

288
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:55,565
Look...
- No tax?

289
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:57,525
All right, What do you got?
What do you got.

290
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:01,035
You know, you smart shit.
You not like those stupid fucks.

291
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:03,175
Yeah, I'm the smart guy.

292
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:06,365
You're a smart kid.
Give me your best one, okay?

293
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:08,955
Here, this the best one.
- This is a good one?

294
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:11,455
Yeah, The best shit, man.
- Okay.

295
00:29:11,555 --> 00:29:12,835
Here you go.
I'll take one.

296
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:14,715
Keep the change.
- Thank you.

297
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:16,295
Want a cigarette?

298
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:19,455
Get out of here.
You shouldn't smoke.

299
00:29:20,235 --> 00:29:22,275
Thank you. Take it easy.

300
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:31,725
I need to talk to you about
something before we go out again.

301
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:33,825
What's that?

302
00:29:34,745 --> 00:29:36,745
Yesterday.
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:29:37,995 --> 00:29:39,995
Wasn't cool.

304
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:43,785
Yeah, I know.
You'll get it, though.

305
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:49,435
So, you're a ranger, huh?
- Yeah.

306
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:54,430
I was in intelligence seven years
before I joined EOD.

307
00:29:54,725 --> 00:30:00,250
We ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine.

308
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:06,885
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a
piece of redneck trailer trash like you.

309
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:10,130
Looks like you're on the right track.

310
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:12,825
We'll see you out there.

311
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:25,465
Let's go, move.

312
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:33,835
Shit. Get out of the way. Move.

313
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:40,095
Hallo.

314
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,715
Where is it?
- It's behind the wall.

315
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:45,175
All right.
- See any wires? Any smoke?

316
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:46,345
No, I didn't look.

317
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:47,465
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

318
00:30:47,565 --> 00:30:49,845
Car has been parked illegally.

319
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:50,974
The suspension is sagging.

320
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:53,015
There's definitely something
heavy in the trunk.

321
00:30:53,115 --> 00:30:57,645
Right. So, why don't you walk over there
and peak inside and tell me what you see.

322
00:30:57,745 --> 00:31:00,295
You want me to go close to it?

323
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,215
Yeah. No-no, I don't. I'm kidding.

324
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:56,615
Shit.

325
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,010
It's coming from over here.

326
00:32:04,935 --> 00:32:06,935
Blaster One, You there?

327
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:14,270
Blaster One, you hear me?

328
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,065
Here.

329
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:25,785
Shit.

330
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:29,285
Let's go, guys.

331
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,695
Let it go.

332
00:32:32,795 --> 00:32:34,115
I got top cover.

333
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:35,195
That's a negative, specialist.

334
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:36,575
Eldridge, you stay with me.

335
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,155
Sanborn, you take top covers.

336
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:40,255
Shit.

337
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:21,420
Blaster Mike in position.

338
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:47,265
What do you got?

339
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:50,685
I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stable.

340
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:52,315
He's not going to make it.

341
00:33:52,415 --> 00:33:54,145
We're leaving in 15 minutes.

342
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:56,455
Got a survival wound, sir.

343
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:59,415
He's not going to make it.

344
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:29,155
Oh, God.

345
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,010
What's he doing?
- I don't know.

346
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:46,735
What are you doing?

347
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,285
There's enough bang in there
to send us all to Jesus.

348
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:53,125
lf I'm going to die.
I'm going to die comfortable.

349
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:55,165
I need my kit and my cans.

350
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:57,125
What's going on down there, Eldridge?

351
00:34:57,225 --> 00:35:01,475
I'm getting his kit and his cans.
Cover me, please.

352
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,525
Kit and cans.

353
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:32,455
Got a lot of deck cord, electrical.

354
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:54,835
I'm looking for this initiating system

355
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:23,945
Well, it's not in the back seat.

356
00:36:25,395 --> 00:36:27,395
I don't think.

357
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:43,890
All right. It's not in the back seat.

358
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:54,735
Got a young man on the roof,
your 9:00. Keep an eye on him.

359
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:56,835
Roger that.

360
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:06,270
It's not in the front seat.

361
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:13,565
It's not in the door.

362
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:21,485
Not on the floors.

363
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:26,765
Not in the glove box.

364
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:29,105
lf you haven't found it yet,
it's probably under the car.

365
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:34,645
Yeah. No wire leads under... the car.
It's all in here somewhere.

366
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:41,865
Hey, Sanborn.
- Yeah.

367
00:37:41,965 --> 00:37:44,915
You got eyes on some guy.
with a video camera?

368
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,285
No, Where?

369
00:37:46,385 --> 00:37:52,675
He's right at my 12:00, you see him?
He's pointing the fucking thing at me.

370
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:01,515
Shit.

371
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,345
Negative, I don't see him.

372
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:07,610
Hey, Sanborn. He's right
at my 12:00. Look. 12:00.

373
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,035
Roger that. I got him.

374
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:16,810
Getting ready to put me on YouTube.

375
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:17,995
Little shady.

376
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,735
Yeah, he looks shady.
Keep and eye on him.

377
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:22,045
Okay. So, what's the play?

378
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:26,105
Be smart. Make a good decision, over

379
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:34,385
Got more wire.

380
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:40,925
Leads fucking nowhere.

381
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,775
Fuck.

382
00:38:45,065 --> 00:38:47,275
Hey, James, how you doing?

383
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:49,805
I'm wonderful. How are you?

384
00:38:49,905 --> 00:38:52,795
You know, we've been here a while.

385
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:54,685
We need to get out of here soon.

386
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:56,785
Uh-huh.

387
00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:04,945
We got a lot of eyes on us, James.
We need to get out of here.

388
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:08,530
Roger that. I'm going to figure this out.

389
00:39:09,675 --> 00:39:12,565
James, we need to get out of here.

390
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:14,805
James, do you copy?

391
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:17,185
Fuck it, I get it.

392
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:21,385
Fuck me.

393
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:32,475
Hey, how's it looking in there, soldier?
- All clear.

394
00:39:32,575 --> 00:39:34,515
James, the evac is complete, We can leave.

395
00:39:34,615 --> 00:39:36,015
Let the engineers handle this mess.

396
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:38,750
We moving?
- That's affirmative.

397
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:53,705
lnteresting.

398
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:56,825
What's up with, James?
He's not answering.

399
00:39:56,925 --> 00:40:00,070
Yeah, I think he removed his headset.

400
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:03,415
Well, will you tell him to
put his radio back on, please?

401
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:04,715
Hey, James.

402
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:10,595
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if
you'll please put your headset back on.

403
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:17,825
Uh... that's a negative.

404
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:21,310
That, yeah, that's not going to happen.

405
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:39,960
I got eyes on three guys
at the Minaret at 6:00.

406
00:40:57,575 --> 00:41:00,805
What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

407
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:03,795
Looks like, he's checking the oil.

408
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:42,805
They're communicating
with your cameraman.

409
00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:44,095
This is real bad man.

410
00:41:44,195 --> 00:41:46,745
Get behind the Jersey barrier.

411
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:52,695
I can't see James from here.

412
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:54,795
Get down now.

413
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:01,335
We can go.

414
00:42:07,555 --> 00:42:09,555
Bastard.

415
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,625
We're done.

416
00:42:35,955 --> 00:42:39,075
Sanborn, let's get out of here.

417
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:56,055
Woo.

418
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:09,945
That was good.

419
00:43:19,585 --> 00:43:21,585
Hey, James.
- What?

420
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:26,565
Never turn your headset off again.

421
00:43:51,615 --> 00:43:53,515
You the guy in the bomb suit?

422
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:56,685
No, sir. Sir, that's Sergeant James.
He's right here.

423
00:43:56,785 --> 00:43:58,785
Hey, James.
- Yeah?

424
00:43:58,785 --> 00:44:00,995
Someone's here to see you.

425
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:04,025
You the guy in the flaming car,
Sergeant James?

426
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:06,505
Afternoon, sir.
Uh, yes, sir.

427
00:44:06,755 --> 00:44:09,625
Well, that's just hot shit.

428
00:44:10,005 --> 00:44:12,615
You're a wild man, you know that?

429
00:44:12,715 --> 00:44:14,495
Uh, yes, sir.
- He's a wild man.

430
00:44:14,595 --> 00:44:16,455
You know that?

431
00:44:16,555 --> 00:44:18,415
I want to shake your hand.

432
00:44:18,515 --> 00:44:19,745
Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

433
00:44:19,845 --> 00:44:22,650
How many bombs have you disarmed?

434
00:44:23,265 --> 00:44:24,375
Uh, I'm not quite sure.

435
00:44:24,475 --> 00:44:25,675
Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

436
00:44:25,775 --> 00:44:27,775
I asked you a question.

437
00:44:29,155 --> 00:44:30,135
Eight hundred seventy-three, sir.

438
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:34,145
Eight hundred. And seventy-three.

439
00:44:35,445 --> 00:44:36,935
That's just hot shit.

440
00:44:37,035 --> 00:44:39,355
Eight-hundred and seventy-three.

441
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:43,875
Counting today, sir, yes.
- That's gotta be a record.

442
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:49,315
What's the best way to... go about
disarming one of these things?

443
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:52,090
The way you don't die, sir.

444
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:54,285
That's a good one.

445
00:44:54,385 --> 00:44:57,955
That's spoken like a wild man.
That's good.

446
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:16,475
Hey, what's up, man?
- Oh, hey, wait a minute.

447
00:45:16,575 --> 00:45:18,575
Look who it is.

448
00:45:19,445 --> 00:45:20,935
I want my five bucks back, buddy.

449
00:45:21,035 --> 00:45:23,185
Five dollars for what, man?
You crazy now?

450
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:25,185
Yeah. The DVD you sold me was crap.

451
00:45:25,285 --> 00:45:28,355
You crazy, man. That's impossible.
It's Hollywood special effects.

452
00:45:28,455 --> 00:45:29,985
No. It was shaky.
It was out of focus, buddy.

453
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:31,445
What, you want donkey porn?
- It's crap.

454
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:33,755
Girls on dog?
Gay sex, man?

455
00:45:33,795 --> 00:45:35,195
Anything you want, you get.

456
00:45:35,295 --> 00:45:37,455
I hook you up, man.

457
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:39,325
All right, What... what's your name?

458
00:45:39,425 --> 00:45:41,455
Beckham.
- Beckham like the soccer player?

459
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:43,535
Yeah, man, It's like soccer player.
Now give me my ball.

460
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:44,785
Are you a soccer player?

461
00:45:44,885 --> 00:45:47,835
Yeah, man. Best of the best.
I'm better than Beckham.

462
00:45:47,935 --> 00:45:50,099
You play goalie?
- Yes, I play goalie.

463
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:50,505
Okay.

464
00:45:50,605 --> 00:45:55,215
I'll make you a deal. If you can stop the
ball, I'm going to give you five bucks.

465
00:45:55,315 --> 00:45:57,425
but if you can't...
- And what if... what if I can't?

466
00:45:57,525 --> 00:46:00,805
Listen to me. If I score,
I'm going to keep your ball.

467
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:02,905
Deal?
- Deal.

468
00:46:04,035 --> 00:46:05,015
Get up there.

469
00:46:05,115 --> 00:46:07,655
Go on.

470
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:14,365
Let's see what you got, hot stuff.
- Are you ready?

471
00:46:14,465 --> 00:46:15,985
On three, Ready?

472
00:46:16,085 --> 00:46:19,205
One, two, three. Aahh.

473
00:46:22,805 --> 00:46:23,705
Shit.

474
00:46:23,805 --> 00:46:25,455
Come on. Where's the five dollars?
Man, come on.

Here's five.

00:46:30,645 --> 00:46:32,795
You're an EOD, boomala, boomala.

478
00:46:32,895 --> 00:46:33,925
That's right.

479
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:35,005
It's fun, no?

480
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:37,045
It's cool? It's gangster.

481
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:40,225
Yeah?
- Yeah, I think so.

482
00:46:40,945 --> 00:46:43,725
Tell you what, I'm going to buy...

483
00:46:43,825 --> 00:46:47,650
Let me see if I have
enough money, yeah. Five.

484
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:50,475
I'm going to buy another DVD, okay?

485
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:55,080
But if it's shakey... look at me...
or out of focus...

486
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:57,375
...or any way not 100%.

487
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:00,775
I'm going to chop off your goddammed
head with a dull knife.

488
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:04,615
How do you feel about that?
I'm just kidding.

489
00:47:04,965 --> 00:47:08,995
Here, You're a good kid, man.
You're a good kid, aren't ya?

490
00:47:09,095 --> 00:47:11,095
Owen.

491
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:12,335
Hi.

492
00:47:12,435 --> 00:47:14,435
Hi, sir.
- How are you?

493
00:47:14,555 --> 00:47:16,045
I'm good.
- Good.

494
00:47:16,145 --> 00:47:19,205
What's wrong?
- Brakes are squeaking.

495
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:22,425
Don't trust the mechanics
around here, You know.

496
00:47:22,525 --> 00:47:24,725
So, how you doing?
- Good.

497
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,305
I just want to check the oil.

498
00:47:27,405 --> 00:47:30,805
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well...

499
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:33,065
I'm feeling pretty squared
away, actually, doc.

500
00:47:33,165 --> 00:47:34,935
Good to hear it.

501
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:39,065
So, you getting along with the other
soldiers in your unit?

502
00:47:39,165 --> 00:47:44,535
Yeah. My team's great.
My team leader is inspiring.

503
00:47:45,215 --> 00:47:48,445
Are you being sarcastic, soldier?
- No.

504
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:50,415
He's going to get me killed.

505
00:47:50,515 --> 00:47:52,555
I almost died yesterday.

506
00:47:52,935 --> 00:47:57,335
At least I'll die in the line
of duty, proud and strong.

507
00:47:57,435 --> 00:48:00,045
You know, this doesn't have
to be a bad time in your life.

508
00:48:00,145 --> 00:48:03,465
Going to war is a-- is a once
in a lifetime experience.

509
00:48:03,565 --> 00:48:04,925
It could be fun.

510
00:48:05,025 --> 00:48:07,805
And you know this from your
extensive work in the field, right?

511
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:09,805
I've done my field duty.

512
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:11,905
Where's that? Yale?

513
00:48:13,445 --> 00:48:16,315
Look, you don't want me to come around,
I won't come around.

514
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:18,225
These talks are voluntary.

515
00:48:18,325 --> 00:48:20,325
Look, I'm sorry.

516
00:48:20,455 --> 00:48:22,775
I appreciate what you're saying.
I do.

517
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:25,850
I appreciate our sessions together.

518
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:29,995
but you need to come out from
behind the wire, see what we do.

519
00:48:30,095 --> 00:48:31,575
Well,

520
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,705
if this circumstance calls for it,
I will.

521
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:36,270
Just like every other soldier

522
00:48:41,895 --> 00:48:43,215
Fire in the hole.

523
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:45,315
Firing now.

524
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:51,305
Eee, ooh...

525
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:54,080
Ready for second det?
- Ready.

526
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:57,475
Fire in the hole.
Fire in the hole. Fire in the hole.

527
00:48:57,575 --> 00:48:59,895
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second.

528
00:48:59,995 --> 00:49:03,185
Goddamn it.
I think it forgot my gloves down there.

529
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:05,495
What?
- I forgot my gloves.

530
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:07,495
Hang on.

531
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:44,900
You know, these detonators
misfire all the time.

532
00:49:44,955 --> 00:49:46,955
What are you doing?

533
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:50,655
I'm just saying shit happens,
they misfire.

534
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:55,220
He'd be obliterated to nothing.

535
00:49:56,345 --> 00:49:58,655
His helmet would be left.
You could have that.

536
00:49:58,755 --> 00:50:02,410
Little specs of hair,
charred on the inside.

537
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:05,455
Yeah. There'd be half a helmet somewhere,

538
00:50:05,555 --> 00:50:07,555
bits of hair.

539
00:50:08,645 --> 00:50:11,255
Ask for a change in technique and protocol,

540
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:16,455
make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?

541
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:19,910
You'd have to write the report.

542
00:50:21,445 --> 00:50:24,420
Are you serious?
- I can't write it.

543
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:29,110
No, I mean, are you serious
about killing him?

544
00:51:07,575 --> 00:51:11,060
Twelve o'clock I see an SUV.
- Roger that.

545
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:13,165
I got four armed men.

546
00:51:13,205 --> 00:51:15,205
They're in Haji gear.

547
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:18,885
All right. Go slow and easy.

548
00:51:26,135 --> 00:51:28,135
Careful now.

549
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:33,520
All right. Careful now, guys.

550
00:51:33,555 --> 00:51:35,875
Eldridge, you stay on that 50.
- I got 'em.

551
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:39,345
Obre.... Obre....
Put your gun down.

552
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:43,145
On your knees.
Put your gun down.

553
00:51:43,235 --> 00:51:46,345
Obre, motherfucker.
- Hold up your hands.

554
00:51:46,445 --> 00:51:48,910
Get down, motherfucker. Obre.

555
00:51:49,075 --> 00:51:51,235
Put your gun down now.

556
00:51:56,995 --> 00:51:58,995
Put your gun down.

557
00:52:02,925 --> 00:52:04,925
Advance, advance...

558
00:52:24,735 --> 00:52:26,735
Hands high.

559
00:52:26,985 --> 00:52:29,365
Eldridge, cover.
- I got you.

560
00:52:30,485 --> 00:52:32,695
Pistol, off your hip, now.

561
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:33,685
What you want me to do?

562
00:52:33,785 --> 00:52:37,185
Keep my hands up or take off the pistol?

563
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:40,165
Keep your hands up.
- Okay.

564
00:52:45,175 --> 00:52:47,175
Easy, easy.

565
00:52:47,335 --> 00:52:49,335
Got it.

566
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,355
Can I touch my fucking head now?

567
00:52:54,055 --> 00:52:56,055
Slowly.

568
00:53:02,525 --> 00:53:05,670
We're on the same fucking side, guys.

569
00:53:06,235 --> 00:53:08,235
Jesus.

570
00:53:08,275 --> 00:53:09,965
You guys are wired fucking tight,
you know that?

571
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:13,095
Well, this is no place for a picnic.
What are you guys doing here?

572
00:53:13,195 --> 00:53:14,935
We have a flat tire.
Can you help us?

573
00:53:15,035 --> 00:53:16,605
Sure, yeah. You got any spares?

574
00:53:16,705 --> 00:53:18,765
We have spares, but
we've used up our wrench.

575
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:20,185
How do you use up a wrench?

576
00:53:20,285 --> 00:53:22,855
Well, the uh, the guy over there
with the red thing on his head.

577
00:53:22,955 --> 00:53:24,955
He threw it at someone.

578
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,375
All right.
- Thank you.

579
00:53:30,885 --> 00:53:33,945
That's Chris.
This is the wrench man.

580
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:36,115
Hello, wrench man.
- That's Jimmy.

581
00:53:36,215 --> 00:53:38,575
You know, you can shoot people here.
You don't have to throw a wrench at 'em.

582
00:53:38,675 --> 00:53:40,675
Fuck off.

583
00:53:49,485 --> 00:53:51,485
Take a look at this.

584
00:53:51,485 --> 00:53:54,205
I picked these guys up in Najaf.

585
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:57,780
Nine of hearts, that's one.

586
00:53:58,115 --> 00:54:00,665
And the other...
jack of clubs.

587
00:54:05,665 --> 00:54:08,980
These the same guys?
- Yep, That's them.

588
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:12,905
Does he need a little help there?

589
00:54:13,005 --> 00:54:16,575
What's the problem with the tire? Come on.

590
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,825
No good, boss.
This wrench is too small.

591
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:21,285
All right, solutions? Anyone?

592
00:54:21,385 --> 00:54:23,875
I think there's another wrench in the
back of the Humvee if you want to check.

593
00:54:23,975 --> 00:54:26,955
I'll give it a try.
- All right. Let's do it.

594
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,005
How long you guys out here?

595
00:54:29,105 --> 00:54:31,400
Specialist, what do we got?

596
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:37,515
We have... 23 more days or 22...
- Oh yeah.

597
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:41,395
No one's counting.

598
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:46,785
Contact left.

599
00:54:56,965 --> 00:54:58,535
Take cover.

600
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:01,535
Chris, take the 50.
Jimmy, take that in the Humvee.

601
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:03,635
Got it.
- Come on.

602
00:55:17,145 --> 00:55:19,145
Charlie, go.

603
00:55:19,405 --> 00:55:21,405
Go, go, go.

604
00:55:28,205 --> 00:55:29,275
We need more ammo.

605
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:33,115
Look inside.
Take all the go-bags, Jimmy.

606
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,405
What are we shooting at?
- I don't know.

607
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:40,035
Fuck. The packages are gone.

608
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:41,325
They won't get far on foot.

609
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:46,865
Bring 'em back those fuckers now.
I'm out 500,000 fucking pounds.

610
00:55:57,815 --> 00:55:58,845
I forgot,

611
00:55:58,945 --> 00:56:01,240
it's 500,000 dead or alive.

612
00:56:04,905 --> 00:56:08,220
Okay. Jimmy, give me the Barret.
- Okay.

613
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:11,785
I can't see a thing.

614
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:15,165
Come on.

615
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:22,115
Chris is shooting wild.
Gotta conserve the ammo.

616
00:56:22,215 --> 00:56:24,155
Hey, Chris, can you hear me?

617
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:28,325
Hey, Chris. Chris. Can you hear me?
Chill out on the 50.

618
00:56:28,425 --> 00:56:30,425
Roger that.

619
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,440
Fifty's down.
- They shot Chris.

620
00:56:45,355 --> 00:56:46,925
It must be coming from that building.

621
00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:49,025
I can't see anything.

622
00:56:53,155 --> 00:56:55,155
Movement on the roof.

623
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:09,745
Yeah?

624
00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:11,155
Three meters higher.

625
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:15,205
I'm going to adjust.

626
00:57:43,705 --> 00:57:45,315
Fuck.

627
00:57:45,415 --> 00:57:47,655
Fuck, he's dead.

628
00:57:48,045 --> 00:57:49,535
We've got to get out of here now.

629
00:57:49,635 --> 00:57:50,155
Dammit.

630
00:57:50,255 --> 00:57:51,865
This is Alpha Nine.
We're in deep shit.

631
00:57:51,965 --> 00:57:53,155
I'll get on the Barret.

632
00:57:53,255 --> 00:57:54,035
Go, go, go.

633
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:55,745
Yeah, we're taking incoming fire.

634
00:57:55,845 --> 00:57:56,745
Go, go, go.

635
00:57:56,845 --> 00:57:58,875
No, Sanborn, don't come up here.
- Got it.

636
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,665
Go, buddy, Stay low.
Stay low.

637
00:58:00,765 --> 00:58:02,415
I have two KIA.

638
00:58:02,515 --> 00:58:06,765
correction, three KIA...
our grid last lock stat...

639
00:58:06,895 --> 00:58:07,465
Stay low.

640
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:09,690
Can you get me some help?

641
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:13,235
Behind you.
- Yeah.

642
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:31,505
Breathe easy.

643
00:58:32,965 --> 00:58:34,965
I got movement.
- Yeah.

644
00:58:35,295 --> 00:58:37,505
On the ridge of that house

645
00:58:40,925 --> 00:58:43,245
Eight hundred and fifty meters.

646
00:58:43,345 --> 00:58:45,345
See it.
- By the window.

647
00:58:46,225 --> 00:58:49,675
You got target.
- Got it.

648
00:58:56,485 --> 00:58:58,865
All right, here little left.

649
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,235
Just breathe easy.

650
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:11,825
I'm out of ammo.
- Hmm?

651
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:13,945
I'm out of ammo.

652
00:59:14,045 --> 00:59:16,415
Eldridge, we need ammo.

653
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:22,745
Where is it?

654
00:59:22,845 --> 00:59:24,705
Check on the dead guy, man.

655
00:59:24,805 --> 00:59:26,805
It's on the dead man.

656
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,715
Eldridge.

657
00:59:33,815 --> 00:59:35,815
I'm looking.

658
00:59:38,235 --> 00:59:39,845
We need that ammo, man.

659
00:59:39,945 --> 00:59:41,945
All right, man.

660
00:59:42,735 --> 00:59:44,735
Oh, here.

661
00:59:46,955 --> 00:59:48,955
Thanks.

662
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:02,655
All right. Got it.

663
01:00:02,755 --> 01:00:04,755
Same target.

664
01:00:07,725 --> 01:00:09,725
It's fucking jammed.

665
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:11,725
Let me see it.

666
01:00:12,855 --> 01:00:14,005
Fuck.

667
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:18,635
Aw, shit.
The blood's making it jam. Eldridge.

668
01:00:19,275 --> 01:00:20,215
Shit.

669
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:22,425
You gotta clean the blood off, man.
It's making 'em jam.

670
01:00:22,525 --> 01:00:24,525
Specialist.

671
01:00:26,035 --> 01:00:28,355
Clean the blood off.
- Okay.

672
01:00:34,785 --> 01:00:36,785
Clean it. Clean it.

673
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,235
You gotta clean it, man.

674
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:40,335
How?
- Spit and rub.

675
01:00:43,465 --> 01:00:45,465
All right.

676
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:48,440
Spit and rub, buddy.
Spit and rub.

677
01:00:50,555 --> 01:00:53,715
It's not working.
It's not coming off.

678
01:00:58,185 --> 01:01:02,010
Spit and rub. Spit and rub.
Here, take it out.

679
01:01:04,065 --> 01:01:06,095
Use your camel. Use your camel.
- Where is it?

680
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,195
You all right?

681
01:01:08,485 --> 01:01:10,485
Here, use that.

682
01:01:13,325 --> 01:01:14,605
Just breathe, buddy.

683
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:16,145
Come on. Just breathe in.

684
01:01:16,245 --> 01:01:18,325
Good. Here, squeeze.

685
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:21,085
Got it?
- Yeah.

686
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:25,530
Rub that ojive, baby.
Come on. You got it.

687
01:01:34,385 --> 01:01:38,295
You're doing good, man.
You're doing real good.

688
01:01:38,605 --> 01:01:40,605
Got 'em?
- Yeah.

689
01:01:41,315 --> 01:01:42,965
I'm going to keep you safe, buddy, all right?

690
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:44,925
Now let's get these bastards.
Scan your sectors.

691
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:47,025
Scan your sectors.

692
01:01:54,285 --> 01:01:56,495
Kill that fuckin' asshole.

693
01:01:58,165 --> 01:02:00,165
Son of a bitch.

694
01:02:10,675 --> 01:02:13,875
Nice. He's down.

695
01:02:14,925 --> 01:02:18,580
Twenty meters to the right of the building.

696
01:02:22,225 --> 01:02:24,225
I got him.

697
01:02:25,935 --> 01:02:27,935
Fire when ready.

698
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:37,765
He's moving. He's moving.
To the building.

699
01:02:37,865 --> 01:02:40,755
Follow him. You got him?
- Got him.

700
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:46,835
He's down.

701
01:02:48,085 --> 01:02:50,825
Goodnight. Thanks for playing.

702
01:03:01,055 --> 01:03:03,860
Window.
The window. At the window.

703
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:10,685
He's still there.

704
01:03:25,495 --> 01:03:28,025
Left window.
Left window. Got him?

705
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:30,125
Got him.

706
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:50,725
He's down.

707
01:04:46,785 --> 01:04:49,695
Hey, Owen.
- Yeah?

708
01:04:50,495 --> 01:04:53,275
Can you grab the juice
out of the pack, please?

709
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:55,375
Sure.

710
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:08,925
I think we're out.

711
01:05:09,345 --> 01:05:13,765
Got anything left to drink?
- You could try that one.

712
01:05:32,825 --> 01:05:34,825
Thank you.

713
01:06:00,185 --> 01:06:02,855
Drink. Drink it.

714
01:07:06,705 --> 01:07:08,705
Things are real quiet.

715
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:11,495
Yeah, I don't like it.

716
01:07:31,525 --> 01:07:34,435
Hey, Will?
- Yeah?

717
01:07:35,525 --> 01:07:37,525
At your six o'clock

718
01:07:37,945 --> 01:07:42,110
I see movement on the bridge.
Right on the tracks.

719
01:07:43,035 --> 01:07:45,035
Well, handle it.

720
01:07:48,995 --> 01:07:50,995
Should I fire?

721
01:07:51,755 --> 01:07:53,755
It's your call, buddy.

722
01:08:22,405 --> 01:08:24,405
Good job.

723
01:08:54,225 --> 01:08:56,225
Hey, Sanborn.

724
01:09:00,065 --> 01:09:02,065
I think we're done.

725
01:09:14,955 --> 01:09:16,955
Okay? You all right?

726
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:25,155
That's what you get for hitting
your fucking team leader, motherfucker.

727
01:09:25,255 --> 01:09:28,165
Man.
- I'll be right back, I gotta piss.

728
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:29,745
Owen.

729
01:09:29,845 --> 01:09:31,955
Another round, boy.
That's your order.

730
01:09:32,055 --> 01:09:34,455
Well, yes, sir, Sgt. James, sir.

731
01:09:34,555 --> 01:09:36,085
You're not very good
with people, are you, sir?

732
01:09:36,185 --> 01:09:39,135
But you're a good warrior.
Give me your mug.

733
01:09:39,235 --> 01:09:40,005
There ya go, sir.

734
01:09:40,105 --> 01:09:43,715
You were well on the field
of battle today, specialist.

735
01:09:43,815 --> 01:09:45,815
Cheers.

736
01:09:52,915 --> 01:09:55,465
Uh, I'm too old for this shit.

737
01:10:00,045 --> 01:10:02,745
I was scared.
- Yeah?

738
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:07,710
Well, everyone's a coward
about something, you know.

739
01:10:09,345 --> 01:10:11,905
You're good. You're real good.

740
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:14,185
Just what do we have here?

741
01:10:14,685 --> 01:10:17,355
Will has possessions.

742
01:10:18,475 --> 01:10:20,335
I didn't know you owned anything, Will.

743
01:10:20,435 --> 01:10:23,325
Let's see what you got here, Will.

744
01:10:24,645 --> 01:10:25,715
Who is that?

745
01:10:25,815 --> 01:10:27,815
That's my son.

746
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:32,185
He's a tough little bastard.
Nothing like me.

747
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:35,005
You mean to tell me you married?

748
01:10:36,245 --> 01:10:39,645
Well, you know,
I had a girlfriend and...

749
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:43,015
...she got pregnant,
so we got married.

750
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:45,625
We got divorced.

751
01:10:47,585 --> 01:10:49,495
Or I thought we got divorced.

752
01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:52,915
She's still living in the house.
And she says we're still together.

753
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:56,625
so I don't know.
What does that make her?

754
01:10:56,935 --> 01:11:00,385
Dumb for still being with your ass.

755
01:11:02,355 --> 01:11:03,255
Hey.

756
01:11:03,355 --> 01:11:05,005
She ain't fuckin' dumb,
all right?

757
01:11:05,105 --> 01:11:07,105
She's just loyal.

758
01:11:08,145 --> 01:11:11,725
She's just loyal. That's all.
How 'bout you guys?

759
01:11:11,825 --> 01:11:15,395
You got... you got a girl?
What do you got?

760
01:11:15,535 --> 01:11:18,985
My only problem is the girl I do like.

761
01:11:19,745 --> 01:11:22,355
I can't stop her from talking
about babies, man.

762
01:11:22,455 --> 01:11:25,175
Well, give her your sperm, stud.

763
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:27,105
Go on. Do it.

764
01:11:27,205 --> 01:11:29,365
C'mon, chicken. Just give it to her.
- No. Hell no.

765
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:30,445
Make babies.

766
01:11:30,545 --> 01:11:34,205
I know when I'm ready, and l
ain't ready for that yet. I know that.

767
01:11:34,305 --> 01:11:38,245
Well, well...
what do we have here?

768
01:11:39,805 --> 01:11:41,805
Uh, components.

769
01:11:42,555 --> 01:11:44,795
They're bomb parts. Signatures.

770
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:49,315
Yeah, I see that, but
what they doing under your bed?

771
01:11:49,855 --> 01:11:51,855
Well...

772
01:11:57,905 --> 01:11:58,935
Ah-ha.

773
01:11:59,035 --> 01:12:01,035
There we go. This one.

774
01:12:01,285 --> 01:12:04,975
This one is from the U.N. building.

775
01:12:05,035 --> 01:12:08,725
Flaming car.
Dead man's switch. Boom.

776
01:12:09,085 --> 01:12:11,635
This guy was good. I like him.

777
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,760
Relay.
- Ah... look at this one.

778
01:12:14,835 --> 01:12:19,085
This one, y'all, is from
our first call together.

779
01:12:20,515 --> 01:12:24,510
This box is full of stuff
that almost killed me.

780
01:12:25,055 --> 01:12:26,415
And what about this one?

781
01:12:26,515 --> 01:12:29,425
Where's this one from, Will?
- It's my wedding ring.

782
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:32,925
Like I said.
stuff that almost killed me.

783
01:12:33,065 --> 01:12:37,475
You know, I just think
it's really interesting...

784
01:12:37,615 --> 01:12:39,765
...to hold something in your hand
that could have killed anyone.

785
01:12:39,865 --> 01:12:43,775
Damn that. It's all that shit
from radio shack.

786
01:12:45,245 --> 01:12:47,065
It's interesting.

787
01:12:47,165 --> 01:12:48,605
I think it's interesting too.

788
01:12:48,705 --> 01:12:50,355
Well, I think you hit me harder...

789
01:12:50,455 --> 01:12:53,565
...than I hit you, motherfucker,
therefore I owe you a punch.

790
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:55,615
Now get your ass up. C'mon.

791
01:12:55,715 --> 01:12:58,775
C'mon. Let's go. C'mon.
- He's right.

792
01:13:00,215 --> 01:13:01,205
Come on.

793
01:13:01,305 --> 01:13:03,245
All right, hold on, boys.
We need some rules.

794
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:05,075
Sanborn, no face shots.

795
01:13:05,175 --> 01:13:06,165
Oh, there's gonna be a face shot.

796
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:08,415
Sergeant James, take off your shirt.

797
01:13:08,515 --> 01:13:10,255
Yes, sir.

798
01:13:10,355 --> 01:13:11,585
What happened?

799
01:13:11,685 --> 01:13:14,385
My momma dropped me
when I was a baby.

800
01:13:14,485 --> 01:13:15,585
Looks like frag scars.

801
01:13:15,685 --> 01:13:19,765
Let it go, Eldridge. C'mon.
- All right.

802
01:13:20,115 --> 01:13:22,115
Nice and big.

803
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:28,615
Oohh.

804
01:13:35,585 --> 01:13:36,695
You like that, huh?

805
01:13:36,795 --> 01:13:38,795
That's all you got?

806
01:13:39,005 --> 01:13:41,005
Come on.

807
01:13:43,005 --> 01:13:45,005
Bring some, C'mon.

808
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:48,385
Ooh.

809
01:13:50,975 --> 01:13:54,095
Wooh. God damn.

810
01:13:54,565 --> 01:13:56,565
That's gotta hurt.

811
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:02,285
You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah.

812
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:06,210
Oh, he's all right.
- Get up, bitch.

813
01:14:07,405 --> 01:14:09,405
All right, bitch.

814
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:13,605
What do you got now?
- Get the fuck off me?

815
01:14:13,705 --> 01:14:15,275
What do you got?
- Get off me, you mother fucker.

816
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:17,195
What do you got? What do you got?

817
01:14:17,295 --> 01:14:20,315
Wooh, he's a wild one.
We got a wild one.

818
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:22,405
C'mon, Sanborn. Get him.
- That's right.

819
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:26,195
Ride him, baby.
- Get off me.

820
01:14:26,255 --> 01:14:27,865
C'mon, bitch.
- C'mon, guys.

821
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:29,965
What do you got?

822
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,495
Get off me.

823
01:14:31,595 --> 01:14:33,595
Hey, hey, hey.

824
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:47,085
I'm just kidding, motherfucker.
Shit.

825
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,975
You're all right, Sanborn.

826
01:14:50,075 --> 01:14:50,935
You're all right, man.

827
01:14:51,035 --> 01:14:53,840
Owen, get this guy a drink.
C'mon.

828
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:56,435
You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

829
01:14:56,535 --> 01:14:57,855
All right, here.
- All right.

830
01:14:57,955 --> 01:14:59,208
See you later.
- Be safe.

831
01:14:59,308 --> 01:14:59,735
All right.

832
01:14:59,835 --> 01:15:03,445
All right, come on big boy.
Damn, boy, you need to get on a diet.

833
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:05,925
He hurt his knee.
C'mon, man.

834
01:15:07,175 --> 01:15:10,165
Steps. C'mon.

835
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:13,915
Step. Step.

836
01:15:19,145 --> 01:15:23,845
All right, lay down.
All right. Get some rest.

837
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:29,875
Hey, James, you think I got
what it takes to put on the suit?

838
01:15:32,025 --> 01:15:34,025
Hell, no.

839
01:15:34,865 --> 01:15:36,865
Night, boy.

840
01:16:30,465 --> 01:16:32,465
Oh.

841
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:38,035
Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.

842
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:44,680
Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death
of sitting behind a desk all the time.

843
01:16:45,395 --> 01:16:48,625
That'd be a privilege.
Hop in, Colonel.

844
01:16:51,855 --> 01:16:53,855
Hey, Doc.

845
01:16:53,855 --> 01:16:55,465
Not to insult your intelligence, sir.

846
01:16:55,565 --> 01:16:58,805
but if the shit hits the fan,
please don't fire out the Humvee.

847
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:02,225
The round will just bounce around
and someone might get shot.

848
01:17:02,325 --> 01:17:06,490
I don't like getting shot.
- Understood, Sergeant.

849
01:17:18,295 --> 01:17:19,325
Oh, it's a pretty standard mission.

850
01:17:19,425 --> 01:17:22,035
We're just here to pick up
some unexploded ordinance.

851
01:17:22,135 --> 01:17:25,335
Sergeant James is
gonna see what the deal is.

852
01:17:25,435 --> 01:17:27,955
and then hopefully we'll be
gone in a couple minutes.

853
01:17:28,055 --> 01:17:29,795
We've gotta gear up.
- For what?

854
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,335
Security hasn't gone in.

855
01:17:31,435 --> 01:17:32,835
Go in quiet.

856
01:17:32,935 --> 01:17:34,485
Radios off.
- Roger.

857
01:17:34,585 --> 01:17:35,425
Roger that.

858
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:38,670
Glad you came.
- Stay safe. All right.

859
01:20:30,565 --> 01:20:32,565
Psst, Psst.

860
01:20:42,115 --> 01:20:44,115
Clear.

861
01:20:44,455 --> 01:20:45,525
Hey.

862
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:47,835
cigarette's still smoking.

863
01:20:51,335 --> 01:20:53,335
It's all our shit.

864
01:20:56,175 --> 01:20:58,175
Motherfucking goldmine.

865
01:20:59,805 --> 01:21:01,805
Watch out for trips.

866
01:21:25,455 --> 01:21:27,455
I got something.

867
01:21:40,055 --> 01:21:42,055
I know this kid.

868
01:21:42,595 --> 01:21:45,485
His name's Beckham. He sells DVDs.

869
01:21:45,635 --> 01:21:48,780
You ever see a body bomb before, man?

870
01:21:50,265 --> 01:21:53,175
It's disgusting. Let's get outta here.

871
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,275
Hold it.

872
01:21:55,695 --> 01:22:02,240
Eldridge, want you to grab all the C4 and
deck cord you can get your hands on.

873
01:22:03,865 --> 01:22:05,645
Let's get all this ordinance outta here.

874
01:22:05,745 --> 01:22:08,935
And we're just gonna...
we're gonna blow the place.

875
01:22:09,035 --> 01:22:11,035
Roger. Just blow it.

876
01:22:19,295 --> 01:22:21,295
What are you doing?

877
01:22:21,795 --> 01:22:24,855
Yeah? Putting the stones in to move.

878
01:22:25,715 --> 01:22:27,665
Yeah. That's really wonderful,

879
01:22:27,765 --> 01:22:30,740
but it's a little bit unsafe today.

880
01:22:31,895 --> 01:22:33,295
Yeah, it's a little unsafe.

881
01:22:33,395 --> 01:22:35,005
So maybe... I don't know.

882
01:22:35,105 --> 01:22:38,345
I'm thinking maybe we should move?

883
01:22:38,565 --> 01:22:40,565
No?

884
01:22:56,455 --> 01:22:58,455
Fuck.

885
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:03,575
You all right?
- Yeah.

886
01:23:03,675 --> 01:23:05,675
You?
- Yeah.

887
01:23:11,015 --> 01:23:13,225
You all right, man?
- Yeah.

888
01:23:14,345 --> 01:23:16,345
No one in or out, okay?

889
01:23:58,145 --> 01:24:00,780
Cancel the det. Cancel the det.

890
01:24:22,045 --> 01:24:25,955
What the fuck is he doing?
- I don't know, man.

891
01:24:26,505 --> 01:24:28,505
I don't know.

892
01:25:56,175 --> 01:25:58,175
I'm coming out.

893
01:25:58,345 --> 01:26:00,345
Roger that.

894
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:22,135
Where are you from?
- New York.

895
01:26:22,235 --> 01:26:24,015
The Big Apple.

896
01:26:24,115 --> 01:26:25,605
Are you from lraq?

897
01:26:25,705 --> 01:26:27,765
I love it here.
This is a beautiful place.

898
01:26:27,865 --> 01:26:30,185
But it's not too safe here, okay?

899
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:34,110
So, I think we need--
we need to move. Please.

900
01:26:58,235 --> 01:26:59,925
You think it's that little Beckham?

901
01:27:00,025 --> 01:27:01,885
No. I don't.

902
01:27:01,985 --> 01:27:04,315
You're positive?
- Sure.

903
01:27:04,985 --> 01:27:07,855
Hey, I don't know, man.
They all look the same, right?

904
01:27:07,955 --> 01:27:08,805
I know.

905
01:27:08,905 --> 01:27:12,815
Will seemed sure. That was weird.
- Very weird.

906
01:27:14,665 --> 01:27:17,115
Please, just move.

907
01:27:17,455 --> 01:27:19,825
Move. Move.

908
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:24,455
Move on. Thank you.

909
01:27:27,885 --> 01:27:29,665
I'm sorry.

910
01:27:29,765 --> 01:27:31,585
Will's very weird.

911
01:27:31,685 --> 01:27:33,795
I mean he keeps bomb parts under his bed.

912
01:27:33,895 --> 01:27:38,910
I'll bet you he won't keep any
of these parts under his bed.

913
01:27:38,975 --> 01:27:40,975
Bye-bye.

914
01:27:41,855 --> 01:27:44,405
Yeah, bye-bye, Bye, Thank you.

915
01:27:45,155 --> 01:27:47,015
Hey, Colonel.

916
01:27:47,115 --> 01:27:47,885
Let's go.

917
01:27:47,985 --> 01:27:50,385
Hallo, thank you.

918
01:27:57,665 --> 01:27:59,665
IED.

919
01:28:00,665 --> 01:28:02,665
Cambridge.

920
01:28:06,635 --> 01:28:08,075
Get back. Get down.

921
01:28:08,175 --> 01:28:09,655
Stay back.

922
01:28:09,755 --> 01:28:12,455
Stay back. Sanborn, keep 'em back.

923
01:28:12,555 --> 01:28:13,325
Is anyone hurt?

924
01:28:13,425 --> 01:28:16,045
Cambridge. Fuck.

925
01:28:16,845 --> 01:28:18,845
Cambridge.

926
01:28:19,315 --> 01:28:20,965
Cambridge, come out.
We gotta go.

927
01:28:21,065 --> 01:28:22,925
Oh, he's dead.

928
01:28:23,025 --> 01:28:25,675
Hey, we gotta find Cambridge.
Doc.

929
01:28:25,775 --> 01:28:28,255
Eldridge.
- Doc.

930
01:28:29,235 --> 01:28:31,855
Eldridge, c'mon, man. C'mon

931
01:28:31,905 --> 01:28:33,895
I just saw him.
He was walking right here.

932
01:28:33,995 --> 01:28:37,395
I know. He's dead.
Look, he's dead. Okay?

933
01:28:51,255 --> 01:28:52,495
It's all right, man.

934
01:28:52,595 --> 01:28:54,635
It'll be all right, man.

935
01:29:18,325 --> 01:29:20,325
Hello?

936
01:29:21,495 --> 01:29:23,495
Hello?

937
01:29:23,495 --> 01:29:25,495
Will?

938
01:29:26,835 --> 01:29:28,835
Hello?

939
01:29:31,045 --> 01:29:33,045
Hello?

940
01:30:24,265 --> 01:30:25,795
Hey, let me ask you a question.

941
01:30:25,895 --> 01:30:28,545
What happened to the little kid
that used to work here?

942
01:30:28,645 --> 01:30:32,175
Sorry, man.
English l... no English.

943
01:30:32,235 --> 01:30:35,550
No-no English.
You no speak English now.

944
01:30:35,565 --> 01:30:38,715
Little kid, Beckham is his name.
He sells... sells DVDs.

945
01:30:38,815 --> 01:30:41,565
DVD, One DVD, $5.

946
01:30:41,655 --> 01:30:43,185
Oh, Jesus Christ.

947
01:30:43,285 --> 01:30:45,015
$5.
- Excuse me, soldier.

948
01:30:45,115 --> 01:30:46,315
you in charge of this area here?

949
01:30:46,415 --> 01:30:48,965
What's up?
- You know this guy?

950
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,645
How do we know that he's not giving intel...

951
01:30:51,745 --> 01:30:53,315
...to insurgents, telling them
where to drop mortars?

952
01:30:53,415 --> 01:30:54,815
I think he's just selling DVDs.

953
01:30:54,915 --> 01:30:57,275
Well, he's a security risk.
We should get rid of him.

954
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:58,445
What are you looking at?

955
01:30:58,545 --> 01:31:01,416
He's just selling DVDs, man.
All the merchants are cleared.

956
01:31:01,516 --> 01:31:01,905
By who?

957
01:31:02,005 --> 01:31:06,995
I couldn't do anything with him
until I got the clear from my CO.

958
01:31:07,095 --> 01:31:09,095
Okay, Fuck.

959
01:31:09,725 --> 01:31:11,725
Fuck.

960
01:31:47,305 --> 01:31:49,515
Does this change anything?

961
01:31:49,935 --> 01:31:52,085
You speak English now,
don't you?

962
01:31:52,185 --> 01:31:54,480
Yalla, yalla. Drive.
- Okay.

963
01:32:15,745 --> 01:32:17,745
Ok.
- This is his house?

964
01:32:18,045 --> 01:32:20,045
Beckham's house?

965
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:30,175
Wait here.

966
01:32:39,065 --> 01:32:41,065
Fuck.

967
01:33:39,075 --> 01:33:41,075
Psst, psst. Shh.

968
01:33:41,995 --> 01:33:43,315
You speak English?

969
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,145
English. French. Arabic.

970
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:47,245
Good. Open you vest.

971
01:33:47,795 --> 01:33:49,795
Ah, stay there, Stay.

972
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:52,235
Tell me what you know about Beckham.

973
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:53,405
For whom?

974
01:33:53,505 --> 01:33:57,365
Beckham, 12-year-old boy, body bomb.
Stay right there.

975
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,495
I don't know.
- You don't know.

976
01:33:59,595 --> 01:34:03,165
But please, sit down.
I am Professor Navid.

977
01:34:03,225 --> 01:34:05,005
This is my home.

978
01:34:05,105 --> 01:34:08,175
You are a guest.
Please, sit down.

979
01:34:10,775 --> 01:34:12,775
I'm a guest.

980
01:34:14,485 --> 01:34:18,645
Just... I'm looking for
the people responsible...

981
01:34:20,075 --> 01:34:22,075
...for-for-for Beckham.

982
01:34:22,415 --> 01:34:24,655
You are CIA, no?

983
01:34:25,955 --> 01:34:28,905
I am very pleased to see CIA in my home.

984
01:34:29,005 --> 01:34:31,005
Please, sit.

985
01:34:38,215 --> 01:34:40,215
How can l...

986
01:34:44,135 --> 01:34:46,770
Be careful. The gun can go off.

987
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:44,595
USA, friendly coming in.

988
01:35:44,695 --> 01:35:47,535
Stop. Get the fuck down.

989
01:35:47,535 --> 01:35:48,935
USA, friendly.

990
01:35:49,035 --> 01:35:51,475
On your knees.
- Get on your knees, now.

991
01:35:51,575 --> 01:35:55,695
On your knees.
- You will be shot. Don't move.

992
01:35:55,755 --> 01:35:57,405
On your knees.
- Down, now.

993
01:35:57,505 --> 01:36:01,075
Open your jacket.
- Opening my jacket.

994
01:36:01,135 --> 01:36:03,135
Cover. Get him down.

995
01:36:03,135 --> 01:36:04,455
On the ground.
- I have a weapon.

996
01:36:04,555 --> 01:36:06,555
Don't fucking move.

997
01:36:06,635 --> 01:36:10,125
Tower, hold cover. Searching.
- I have a weapon.

998
01:36:10,225 --> 01:36:12,225
Gun.
- Like I said.

999
01:36:13,105 --> 01:36:14,585
Weapons clear.

1000
01:36:14,685 --> 01:36:16,335
ID?

1001
01:36:16,435 --> 01:36:17,885
What the fuck are you doing?

1002
01:36:17,985 --> 01:36:19,985
I was at a whorehouse.

1003
01:36:20,195 --> 01:36:25,635
All right, lf I let you in, will
you tell me where it is exactly?

1004
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:29,115
Yeah.

1005
01:36:30,155 --> 01:36:32,195
James, do you copy?

1006
01:36:41,755 --> 01:36:44,390
James do you have your ears on?

1007
01:36:47,215 --> 01:36:49,215
James?

1008
01:36:50,135 --> 01:36:52,260
This is James. What's up?

1009
01:37:07,315 --> 01:37:09,435
Hey.
- What's up, man?

1010
01:37:12,445 --> 01:37:14,645
Look, we have a tank explosion
in the Green Zone.

1011
01:37:14,745 --> 01:37:16,395
We have to post-blast assessment,

1012
01:37:16,495 --> 01:37:17,855
see if it was a suicide bomber.

1013
01:37:17,955 --> 01:37:20,485
and if so, how the fuck did he do it?

1014
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:22,025
Okay.

1015
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:23,905
Where'd you say you were again?

1016
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:26,385
I didn't, Sergeant.
Let's go.

1017
01:37:27,835 --> 01:37:30,725
What happened to your head, James?

1018
01:37:36,975 --> 01:37:38,795
Hey, you ready?

1019
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:41,190
Game face, buddy. Let's go.

1020
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:47,885
You ready?
- Let's do this.

1021
01:37:47,985 --> 01:37:50,195
Rock and roll. Moving out.

1022
01:38:03,585 --> 01:38:06,135
USA friendlies coming through.

1023
01:38:26,225 --> 01:38:28,520
Make room, guys. Make room.

1024
01:38:40,405 --> 01:38:42,405
Hey, Sanborn.

1025
01:38:43,205 --> 01:38:45,205
Oh, shit.

1026
01:39:10,895 --> 01:39:12,895
An oil tanker?
- Yep.

1027
01:39:15,945 --> 01:39:18,750
That's a pretty long flight, huh?

1028
01:41:25,155 --> 01:41:28,300
This is the edge of the blast radius.

1029
01:41:33,115 --> 01:41:35,115
Jesus.

1030
01:41:35,665 --> 01:41:37,145
So, where's our triggerman?

1031
01:41:37,245 --> 01:41:39,315
Burnt up in the flames, man.

1032
01:41:39,415 --> 01:41:41,275
Suicide bomber.

1033
01:41:41,375 --> 01:41:43,655
We're never going
to find a body in that shit.

1034
01:41:43,755 --> 01:41:45,965
What if there was no body?

1035
01:41:46,965 --> 01:41:49,345
What if it was a remote det?

1036
01:41:53,225 --> 01:41:57,475
A really good bad guy
hides out in the dark, right?

1037
01:41:58,805 --> 01:42:02,495
Right here.
Perfect vantage point.

1038
01:42:03,105 --> 01:42:08,970
outside the blast radius to sit back
and watch us clean up their mess.

1039
01:42:10,025 --> 01:42:12,830
Want to go out there?
- Yes, I do.

1040
01:42:14,325 --> 01:42:18,515
I could stand to get in a little trouble.
- No, man. This is bullshit.

1041
01:42:18,615 --> 01:42:23,105
You got three infantry platoons behind
you whose job it is to go Haji huntin'.

1042
01:42:23,205 --> 01:42:24,315
That ain't our fuckin' job.

1043
01:42:24,415 --> 01:42:27,155
You don't say no to me, Sanborn.
I say no to you.

1044
01:42:27,255 --> 01:42:29,325
You know there are guys
watching us right now.

1045
01:42:29,425 --> 01:42:33,535
They're laughing at this.
Okay, I'm not okay with that.

1046
01:42:33,635 --> 01:42:38,140
Now, turn off your goddammed
torch 'cause we're going.

1047
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:47,645
Now we know where their
oil tanker came from.

1048
01:43:47,745 --> 01:43:49,315
No shit. Same kind.

1049
01:43:49,415 --> 01:43:51,235
We're close.
- Yeah.

1050
01:43:51,335 --> 01:43:53,115
They alleyways
are probably set up on a grid.

1051
01:43:53,215 --> 01:43:56,285
We're going to need
to split up, flush 'em out.

1052
01:43:56,385 --> 01:43:58,785
Sanborn, you take one.
Eldridge, take two.

1053
01:43:58,885 --> 01:44:01,785
I got three.
Rally point at your intersection.

1054
01:44:01,885 --> 01:44:04,415
Ready, move.
- Wait, rally point when?

1055
01:44:04,515 --> 01:44:06,515
Fuck.

1056
01:44:31,995 --> 01:44:33,995
Ipsura, ipsura.
Go, go.

1057
01:45:19,125 --> 01:45:21,125
Shit, Ahh.

1058
01:45:27,555 --> 01:45:28,365
Shit.

1059
01:45:28,465 --> 01:45:30,665
You got contact?
- Who was it? What's going on?

1060
01:45:30,765 --> 01:45:33,485
What do you got?
- It's Eldridge.

1061
01:45:34,095 --> 01:45:35,125
Go, go.

1062
01:45:35,225 --> 01:45:37,225
Man down. Man down.

1063
01:45:37,975 --> 01:45:39,585
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1064
01:45:39,685 --> 01:45:42,845
Negative, negative. It's not him.
- He's gone.

1065
01:45:42,945 --> 01:45:44,135
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

1066
01:45:44,235 --> 01:45:46,345
Tankers and troops are that way.

1067
01:45:46,445 --> 01:45:48,570
Let's go this way.
- Fuck.

1068
01:46:10,885 --> 01:46:13,085
Use your torch. On three.

1069
01:46:15,265 --> 01:46:16,875
Ready?

1070
01:46:16,975 --> 01:46:19,345
One, two, three.

1071
01:46:21,685 --> 01:46:23,685
Fuck.
- Shit.

1072
01:46:28,695 --> 01:46:30,695
Softly, softly, softly.

1073
01:46:41,705 --> 01:46:42,855
On three.

1074
01:46:42,955 --> 01:46:44,955
One. Two. Three.

1075
01:46:49,085 --> 01:46:51,085
Now. Go, go, go.

1076
01:46:53,505 --> 01:46:56,375
Eldridge, you okay?
- Fuck, dude. I'm hit.

1077
01:46:56,475 --> 01:46:58,335
Hit him in the fuckin' leg.

1078
01:46:58,435 --> 01:47:00,435
Come on.

1079
01:47:00,435 --> 01:47:04,175
Am I dead? Am I dead?
- No. You're fine, man.

1080
01:47:04,395 --> 01:47:06,395
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1081
01:47:07,775 --> 01:47:09,925
I'm going to put some
pressure down, Come on.

1082
01:47:10,025 --> 01:47:12,025
You're all right.

1083
01:47:12,315 --> 01:47:14,765
Look at me, look at me.
You all right.

1084
01:47:14,865 --> 01:47:20,900
All right, buddy. You ready to get up?
On three, ready? One, two, three.

1085
01:48:41,785 --> 01:48:44,985
Hey, what's up, man? What's up, man?

1086
01:48:45,205 --> 01:48:48,605
Wanna buy some DVDs?
Wanna play some soccer?

1087
01:48:48,705 --> 01:48:50,315
What's up?

1088
01:48:50,415 --> 01:48:53,050
Come on, man.
Wanna play some...

1089
01:49:09,345 --> 01:49:11,345
Aww, fuck.

1090
01:49:16,775 --> 01:49:18,345
How you doing, buddy?

1091
01:49:18,445 --> 01:49:20,255
Doc says you're going to be okay.

1092
01:49:20,355 --> 01:49:23,975
My fucking femur is shattered
in nine places.

1093
01:49:24,075 --> 01:49:27,055
He said I'll be walking in six months
if I'm fucking lucky.

1094
01:49:27,155 --> 01:49:29,725
Six months ain't bad, huh?
- It's not bad?

1095
01:49:29,825 --> 01:49:31,565
Fuckin' sucks, man.

1096
01:49:31,665 --> 01:49:33,665
Ah, ah.
- Take it easy.

1097
01:49:35,495 --> 01:49:38,470
You see that? You fuckin' see that?

1098
01:49:39,045 --> 01:49:42,325
That's what happens when
you shoot someone, you motherfucker.

1099
01:49:42,425 --> 01:49:44,115
Sorry.

1100
01:49:44,215 --> 01:49:46,680
Sorry, Owen.
- Fuck you, Will.

1101
01:49:46,715 --> 01:49:48,715
Really. Fuck you.

1102
01:49:49,095 --> 01:49:52,915
Thanks for saving my life,
but we didn't have to go out...

1103
01:49:53,015 --> 01:49:57,835
...looking for trouble to get
your fucking adrenaline fix, you fuck.

1104
01:49:57,935 --> 01:49:59,675
Hey, take care of yourself, Owen.

1105
01:49:59,775 --> 01:50:01,295
Come home safe, man.

1106
01:50:01,395 --> 01:50:04,425
See you on the other side, man.
- All right.

1107
01:50:04,525 --> 01:50:07,670
Let's get out of this fucking desert.

1108
01:50:12,655 --> 01:50:13,645
Don't move.

1109
01:50:13,745 --> 01:50:16,775
lf you keep walking we will shoot you.

1110
01:50:16,875 --> 01:50:18,875
Move him back.

1111
01:50:19,585 --> 01:50:21,065
Keep that translator back.

1112
01:50:21,165 --> 01:50:23,115
But the bomb was forced on him.
- Get him back.

1113
01:50:23,215 --> 01:50:25,245
Don't move. Stay still.

1114
01:50:27,295 --> 01:50:31,415
If you keep walking we will shoot you.

1115
01:50:31,555 --> 01:50:34,105
Get that translator back, now.

1116
01:50:37,055 --> 01:50:41,900
He's not a bad man.
- Clear. Give him room. Give him room.

1117
01:50:48,445 --> 01:50:49,975
Hey, what do you got?

1118
01:50:50,075 --> 01:50:51,515
He came walking up to our checkpoint.

1119
01:50:51,615 --> 01:50:54,355
said he had a bomb strapped to him.
But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off.

1120
01:50:54,455 --> 01:50:56,645
Then he starts begging us
to take it off of him.

1121
01:50:56,745 --> 01:50:58,275
Help this man.
He's not a bad man.

1122
01:50:58,375 --> 01:51:01,775
He's not a bad man? He got
a bomb strapped to him.

1123
01:51:01,875 --> 01:51:03,735
This is a joke. He's trying to pull us closer.

1124
01:51:03,835 --> 01:51:05,315
Yeah. I got it, I got it.

1125
01:51:05,415 --> 01:51:10,005
All right. Look...
Tell him to open his shirt slowly...

1126
01:51:10,095 --> 01:51:12,220
...and see what's inside.

1127
01:51:15,555 --> 01:51:17,715
Slowly, slowly.

1128
01:51:28,485 --> 01:51:30,485
Jesus.

1129
01:51:31,195 --> 01:51:33,475
All right, Sergeant,
I need a 75-meter perimeter.

1130
01:51:33,575 --> 01:51:37,435
Get these guys back.
- You heard what he said. Get back.

1131
01:51:37,535 --> 01:51:41,145
You tell him to get on his knees
and touch the sky, okay?

1132
01:51:41,245 --> 01:51:43,105
Slowly.

1133
01:51:43,205 --> 01:51:45,205
Get down.

1134
01:51:48,505 --> 01:51:50,545
Okay, I need your radio.

1135
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:52,535
Can't we just shoot him?
- No.

1136
01:51:52,635 --> 01:51:54,575
He's a a family man.
He's not a bad man.

1137
01:51:54,675 --> 01:51:56,405
He's asking for help, only help.

1138
01:51:56,505 --> 01:52:01,435
Yeah, all right, You don't want
to die, get back. I got it.

1139
01:52:04,515 --> 01:52:07,255
Listen, I know we've had our differences.

1140
01:52:07,355 --> 01:52:11,690
It happened, all right.
It's water under the bridge.

1141
01:52:12,985 --> 01:52:14,985
This is suicide, man.

1142
01:52:16,445 --> 01:52:20,270
That's why they call it
a suicide bomb, right?

1143
01:52:22,285 --> 01:52:23,355
Let's do this, Come on.

1144
01:52:23,455 --> 01:52:26,565
He says the bomb may
have a timer, please hurry.

1145
01:52:26,665 --> 01:52:28,705
We're good, Ready?
- Yep.

1146
01:52:34,125 --> 01:52:35,075
Go get 'em.

1147
01:52:35,175 --> 01:52:38,150
Keep your eyes out on these.
- Yeah.

1148
01:52:48,765 --> 01:52:50,765
Get your hands up.

1149
01:52:53,895 --> 01:52:55,935
He says he has a family.

1150
01:52:56,775 --> 01:52:58,775
Please help him.

1151
01:53:03,995 --> 01:53:05,995
Now, listen.

1152
01:53:05,995 --> 01:53:09,025
Look, It'd be a lot easier for me
to disarm this...

1153
01:53:09,125 --> 01:53:12,695
...if I just shoot you, Do you understand?

1154
01:53:15,585 --> 01:53:16,775
What's he saying?

1155
01:53:16,875 --> 01:53:21,535
He says I don't wish to die, I have a
family... Please take this off me.

1156
01:53:21,635 --> 01:53:28,095
Tell him to put his hands behind his
head or I'll be very happy to shoot him.

1157
01:53:32,105 --> 01:53:33,505
Look, that's not what I said.

1158
01:53:33,605 --> 01:53:38,790
Tell him to put his hands behind
his head or I will shoot him.

1159
01:53:39,905 --> 01:53:41,905
Listen.

1160
01:53:43,325 --> 01:53:45,325
Listen, listen.

1161
01:53:45,745 --> 01:53:49,395
You understand?

1162
01:53:51,785 --> 01:53:53,785
Okay.

1163
01:53:56,255 --> 01:53:58,255
What do you got here?

1164
01:53:58,965 --> 01:54:00,965
He has four children.

1165
01:54:05,715 --> 01:54:07,715
Shit.

1166
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:14,965
Sanborn, we got a timer,
and we got a lot of wires, man.

1167
01:54:15,065 --> 01:54:17,125
I'm going to need a little help on this.

1168
01:54:17,225 --> 01:54:19,175
Roger that. Tell me what you need.

1169
01:54:19,275 --> 01:54:20,505
Bolt cutters.

1170
01:54:20,605 --> 01:54:23,055
You gotta get down here
in two minutes or we're all fucked.

1171
01:54:23,155 --> 01:54:26,470
Roger that.
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1172
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:31,500
He says, please, I have a family.

1173
01:54:33,575 --> 01:54:34,355
Sst.

1174
01:54:34,455 --> 01:54:38,960
I know, It's okay.
You're all right. You're all right.

1175
01:54:43,005 --> 01:54:45,005
Please, don't leave me.

1176
01:54:49,715 --> 01:54:51,455
You weren't fuckin' kidding.

1177
01:54:51,555 --> 01:54:54,105
Nope. What's this made out of?

1178
01:54:59,895 --> 01:55:00,875
Oh, man.

1179
01:55:00,975 --> 01:55:02,975
That's case iron steel.

1180
01:55:04,395 --> 01:55:05,595
Shit.

1181
01:55:05,695 --> 01:55:07,943
What's our time?
- We got two minutes.

1182
01:55:08,043 --> 01:55:08,265
Shit.

1183
01:55:08,365 --> 01:55:10,765
We're going need a torch to get this off.

1184
01:55:10,865 --> 01:55:12,805
Well, we don't have one of those in
the fucking truck, man.

1185
01:55:12,905 --> 01:55:13,515
He's dead, man.

1186
01:55:13,615 --> 01:55:15,105
Hold on, man. Let me think.
Just let me think.

1187
01:55:15,205 --> 01:55:18,275
We're going to handle this.
It's okay. We got this.

1188
01:55:18,375 --> 01:55:20,375
Shh, okay.

1189
01:55:21,045 --> 01:55:23,935
Now listen, you're gonna get back.

1190
01:55:26,875 --> 01:55:29,445
It's just-- we don't
got enough time, Sanborn.

1191
01:55:29,545 --> 01:55:32,535
I just gotta...
I gotta get these bolts off.

1192
01:55:32,635 --> 01:55:35,825
No. We got a minute and a half, man.
We gotta get out of here.

1193
01:55:35,925 --> 01:55:38,665
I'll handle this, Just go.
- Come on, man.

1194
01:55:38,765 --> 01:55:40,505
Look, I'm right behind ya. Just go.

1195
01:55:40,605 --> 01:55:42,295
Fuck him. Come on. Let's go.

1196
01:55:42,395 --> 01:55:45,135
Sanborn, I got the suit. Just go.
- James.

1197
01:55:45,235 --> 01:55:49,305
Sanborn, you have 45 seconds.
You have 45 seconds, Sanborn, leave.

1198
01:55:49,405 --> 01:55:51,015
You're fucking dead, man. Dead.

1199
01:55:51,115 --> 01:55:53,145
Go.

1200
01:55:53,195 --> 01:55:55,675
Everybody get back.
- Go, go.

1201
01:56:01,245 --> 01:56:03,245
We got one.

1202
01:56:03,375 --> 01:56:05,655
Go, get back.

1203
01:56:08,375 --> 01:56:13,695
I can't. There's too many locks.
There's too many, I can't do it.

1204
01:56:13,795 --> 01:56:15,785
I can't get it off. I'm sorry. Okay?

1205
01:56:15,885 --> 01:56:18,095
You understand? I'm sorry.

1206
01:56:18,265 --> 01:56:20,955
I'm sorry. You hear me? I'm sorry.

1207
01:56:21,055 --> 01:56:23,605
Get down now.
- I can help him.

1208
01:56:26,065 --> 01:56:29,265
Get out of here. Go.

1209
01:56:52,375 --> 01:56:53,485
James.

1210
01:56:53,585 --> 01:56:55,880
Everybody up and out.
James.

1211
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:42,345
You all right?

1212
01:57:44,885 --> 01:57:46,885
Aw, man.

1213
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:51,105
I fuckin' hate this place.

1214
01:57:53,485 --> 01:57:55,485
Here, man. Have a hit.

1215
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:09,585
I'm not ready to die, James.

1216
01:58:11,625 --> 01:58:14,825
Well, you're not going to die out here, bro.

1217
01:58:14,925 --> 01:58:16,925
Another two inches.

1218
01:58:19,505 --> 01:58:22,565
Shrapnel zings by, slices my throat.

1219
01:58:23,845 --> 01:58:26,820
I bleed out like a pig in the sand.

1220
01:58:28,895 --> 01:58:30,895
Nobody'll give a shit.

1221
01:58:33,605 --> 01:58:38,960
I mean, my parents'll care,
but they don't count, man. Who else?

1222
01:58:44,695 --> 01:58:46,735
I don't even have a son.

1223
01:58:49,165 --> 01:58:52,065
Well, you're going to have
plenty of time for that, amigo.

1224
01:58:52,165 --> 01:58:54,165
Naw, man.
- You know?

1225
01:58:56,045 --> 01:58:58,045
I'm done.

1226
01:59:02,675 --> 01:59:04,675
I want a son.

1227
01:59:08,105 --> 01:59:10,315
I want a little boy, Will.

1228
01:59:16,855 --> 01:59:19,830
I mean, how do you do it, you know?

1229
01:59:20,905 --> 01:59:22,905
Take the risk?

1230
01:59:30,125 --> 01:59:32,275
I don't know, I just...

1231
01:59:35,045 --> 01:59:37,680
I guess I don't think about it.

1232
01:59:39,945 --> 01:59:41,945
every time we go out...

1233
01:59:42,575 --> 01:59:46,145
...it's life or death.
You roll the dice...

1234
01:59:47,065 --> 01:59:49,105
...and you deal with it.

1235
01:59:49,775 --> 01:59:51,525
You recognize that, don't you?

1236
01:59:52,165 --> 01:59:54,165
Yeah.

1237
02:00:03,465 --> 02:00:05,465
Yeah, I do.

1238
02:00:06,595 --> 02:00:08,595
But I don't know why.

1239
02:00:10,225 --> 02:00:12,225
Yeah.

1240
02:00:21,025 --> 02:00:25,305
I don't know, JT.
You know why I am the way I am?

1241
02:00:31,115 --> 02:00:33,115
Naw, I don't.

1242
02:01:31,935 --> 02:01:35,515
Wow. You did some shopping.
- Yeah.

1243
02:01:36,275 --> 02:01:38,315
I got some soda.
We done?

1244
02:01:39,695 --> 02:01:43,135
You want to go get us some cereal
and I'll meet you at the checkout?

1245
02:01:43,235 --> 02:01:45,235
Okay. Cereal.

1246
02:01:49,495 --> 02:01:51,495
Where?

1247
02:02:50,095 --> 02:02:54,295
Some guy drove his truck to
the middle of an Iraqi market,

1248
02:02:54,395 --> 02:02:56,335
starts passing out free candies.

1249
02:02:56,435 --> 02:03:00,685
All the kids coming running up,
the families stuff.

1250
02:03:01,145 --> 02:03:03,145
He detonates.

1251
02:03:05,065 --> 02:03:07,360
They're saying 59 are dead.

1252
02:03:16,995 --> 02:03:19,970
You know they need more bomb techs.

1253
02:03:22,875 --> 02:03:25,680
You want to chop those up for me?

1254
02:03:26,045 --> 02:03:28,045
Boing, boing, boing.

1255
02:03:35,635 --> 02:03:37,635
Yeah.

1256
02:03:38,725 --> 02:03:41,020
You love playing with that.

1257
02:03:41,435 --> 02:03:44,675
You love playing with all
your stuffed animals.

1258
02:03:44,775 --> 02:03:50,355
You love your mommy, your daddy,
your nature pajamas.

1259
02:03:50,565 --> 02:03:53,710
You love everything, don't you? Yeah.

1260
02:03:54,995 --> 02:03:56,995
You know what, buddy?

1261
02:03:57,365 --> 02:03:59,365
Once you get older,

1262
02:03:59,575 --> 02:04:05,185
some of the things that you love
might not seem so special anymore.

1263
02:04:05,755 --> 02:04:07,965
Like your Jack in the Box.

1264
02:04:10,585 --> 02:04:16,110
Maybe you realize it's just
a piece of tin and a stuffed animal...

1265
02:04:17,635 --> 02:04:22,140
...and then you forget
the few things you really love.

1266
02:04:25,105 --> 02:04:30,800
And by the time you get to my age
maybe it's only one or two things.

1267
02:04:37,235 --> 02:04:39,360
With me I think it's one.

1268
02:05:15,855 --> 02:05:18,915
Welcome to Delta Company.
- Sergeant.
