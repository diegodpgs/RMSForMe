BEIJING, CHINA

2
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,120
Who are you?

3
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,960
We're with the opera troupe.

4
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,280
Oh, I didn't recognize you!

5
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,360
I'm a great fan of you both.

6
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,080
Is that so?

7
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,600
It's been over twenty years since
you performed together, hasn't it?

8
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,400
Twenty-one.

9
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,000
Twenty-two.

10
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,600
Yes, twenty-two years.

11
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,200
And it's been ten
since we last saw each other.

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,760
Eleven. Eleven years.

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,360
That's right, eleven years. Yes.

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,800
It's due to the Gang of Four
and the Cultural Revolution.

15
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,120
Isn't everything?

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,000
Things are better now.

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,160
That's for sure.
Everything's fine now.

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,640
Please, wait here a moment.
I'll go turn on the lights.

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,280
Sorry to trouble you.

20
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,760
FAREWELL, MY CONCUBINE

21
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,720
1 92 4
BEIJING THE WARLORD ERA

22
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,920
Hey, Yanhong, is that you?

23
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,520
It's been ages.
I've really missed you.

24
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,920
Whore!

25
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,160
Ladies and gentlemen,
enjoy the show!

26
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,760
Laizi is trying
to run away again.

27
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,720
Brat! See how far you get!

28
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,960
Quick, go catch him!

29
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,960
Gentlemen, please be patient.

30
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,520
Sirs, do forgive us.

31
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,280
Trash! How dare you
show yourselves around here?

32
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,760
Fuck you all!

33
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,040
Don't anyone move.
You'll get your money's worth!

34
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,360
Just as sure as my name
is Shitou...

35
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,360
I'll give you something
to look at.

36
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,840
What are you screaming for?
I haven't even said hello yet!

37
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,840
You're a disgrace. You couldn't
even play a monkey right.

38
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,520
What are you going to do
with your life?

39
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,240
Thought you'd get away
with that brick act, didn't you?

40
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
It's garbage.

41
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Bring your knives
for sharpening!

42
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,280
Sharpen your knives!

43
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,040
This child isn't fated
to be an actor.

44
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,280
Not with that extra finger.

45
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Think of it.

46
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,840
He'd scare off the audience!

47
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,880
Sharpen your knives!

48
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I can afford to raise him...

49
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,200
but he's getting too big
to keep at the brothel.

50
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,080
Help me. Please take him.

51
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,400
If only you take him,
you can do anything you like.

52
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,280
Don't look down on us.

53
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,480
Don't be foolish.

54
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,520
Prostitutes and actors
are equally despised by society.

55
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,360
But I have no place for him.
What can I do?

56
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,400
Ma, my hand is freezing.
It feels like ice.

57
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,600
Ma!

58
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,880
Get away from us,
you son of a whore!

59
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,120
It's from the whorehouse!
Drop it on the floor!

60
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,200
It's freezing!

61
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
Are you bullying him?

62
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,880
Come over here.
Sleep with me!

63
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
You're really something!

64
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,000
Laizi, go snuggle up
with the Little Monk.

65
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,440
Catch!

66
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,360
It's so cold outside...

67
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,520
the piss froze
on the tip of my dick.

68
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,760
I nearly turned a somersault!

69
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,840
If you belong to the human race,
you go to the opera.

70
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,400
If you don't go to the opera,
you're not a human being.

71
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,720
Pigs and dogs
don't listen to opera.

72
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,480
And are they human?
They're beasts!

73
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,440
And where there's opera,
there's work for us actors!

74
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,240
Stop squealing!

75
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,320
I'm not!

76
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
Straighten that back!

77
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,360
If you think
you're above everyone else...

78
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,200
you'll learn the hard way.

79
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,120
This is just the beginning.
Wait till you see what's in store.

80
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,480
Don't worry, Douzi.
We're already halfway through.

81
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,720
Just keep at it.

82
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,400
Shitou, are you helping
someone cheat?

83
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,800
But, Master, I was looking up.
I didn't notice what was on the floor.

84
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,920
Bullshit! Get me my sword.

85
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,720
And hurry up!

86
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,400
Master!

87
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,480
Get up!

88
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't you have something to say?

89
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,760
Yes. '' Forming cliques is prohibited
and will be punished.''

90
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,280
I'm not fucking scared
of anything.

91
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,440
From the time opera began...

92
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,840
it's never enjoyed such
popularity as it does today!

93
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,160
You're lucky to be part of it!

94
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,880
We are!

95
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,520
'' Heaven's will,
not a lack of material skill...

96
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,080
has doomed
my kingdom of Chu.''

97
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,360
I've been practicing kung fu
to keep myself warm.

98
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
It's cool outside, quite cool.

99
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,040
But I've become a man of fire.
Get away from me.

100
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,760
I am so strong

101
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,880
I can uproot the mountains

102
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,120
My courage is renowned

103
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,160
I've fallen on bad times

104
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,120
Yet even my horse

105
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,560
Won't run away to save itself

106
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,280
''These are our rules.
We must learn them well.

107
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,520
From ancient times,
man has needed a skill.

108
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,840
Having chosen this one,
devote ourselves we will.

109
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,400
In youthful striving lies
the foundation for future fame.''

110
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
Now go off and practice!

111
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,280
Let's hear '' Fleeing by Night.''

112
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,560
''I look back at the Celestial Court
and hurry onwards in flight...

113
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
heedless of... heedless of...''

114
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,960
Heedless of what?

115
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
'' Heedless of loyalty
and filial piety.''

116
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,280
''I am so strong,
I can uproot the mountains.

117
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,720
My courage is renowned.

118
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,720
I've fallen on bad times,
yet even my horse...

119
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,560
won't run away to save itself.

120
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,360
If it won't run away,
what can I do?

121
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,760
And my beloved concubine,
what shall I do about her?''

122
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,960
Excellent,
not a word out of place.

123
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,600
Give me your hand.

124
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,120
This is so you'll remember
to do as well the next time.

125
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,520
''At sixteen I am a nun.
My hair is shorn at youth's prime.''

126
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,360
Go on.

127
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,480
''I am by nature a boy--''
Huh?

128
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,240
''I am by nature a boy--''

129
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,720
You are by nature a girl!
Can't you see you're wrong?!

130
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,880
I'll punish you, Laizi!

131
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,120
You still can't get it right,
can you?

132
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,200
Don't hit me!
I won't do it again!

133
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,160
Sing '' Dreaming of the World
Outside the Nunnery.''

134
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,240
''I am-I am by nature--''

135
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,640
Spit it out!

136
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,800
''I am by nature a boy--''

137
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,640
Is a nun a male or a female?

138
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,880
A-a boy--

139
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,280
You really are in character.
You can't even tell male from female.

140
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,120
''I-I-I am by nature a boy--''

141
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,040
You've forgotten everything
the master has taught you!

142
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,000
Do it again, and I'll beat you
within an inch of your life.

143
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Wrong! Wrong!

144
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,160
You'd better remember this.

145
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,120
If by chance
I'm beaten to death tomorrow...

146
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,040
I want you to have...

147
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,840
the three copper coins
hidden under my mattress.

148
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,960
Careful!

149
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,840
If your hand doesn't heal properly,
your acting career's finished.

150
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Douzi, in a few days, you'll be
initiated into the troupe.

151
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,920
Just pretend you're a girl,
and don't mess up the lyrics again.

152
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Laizi, have you ever eaten
sweet pea cakes?

153
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,000
What's the big deal
about sweet pea cakes?

154
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,640
Have you ever had millet rolls?

155
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,280
'' Basin cakes''?

156
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,160
They're about as fucking special
as dog farts.

157
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
So what do you like?

158
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,560
There's nothing yummier
than a stick of candied crab apples.

159
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,360
If I make it big, I'll eat candied
crab apples every day for dinner.

160
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,480
Candied crab apples for sale!

161
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't look at us like that.
We're not sticks of candied crab apple.

162
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,000
Laizi, you're drooling!

163
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,520
What the hell are you doing?
Get back here.

164
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,920
Wow, so many big kites!

165
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,200
Come back!

166
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
Douzi!

167
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,760
Run for it!

168
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,800
Hold it right there!

169
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,960
Douzi!

170
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,200
Don't forget the money
under my mattress.

171
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,120
You're worthless.
Get out of my sight!

172
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,800
Where'd you get that?

173
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,320
I bought it
with your three copper coins.

174
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,400
Forget Shitou.
I'm spending your money now.

175
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,960
Ten apples on each stick.
I'll give you two. How about it?

176
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,280
What's wrong with you?

177
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,920
I have to pee real bad.

178
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,760
Not in the middle of the street.

179
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,720
Come on!

180
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,840
It's Manager Wang!

181
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,080
The stars have arrived!
Here, come this way.

182
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,120
My dear sir, this is like
a visit from Heaven!

183
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,640
All you need to do is sneeze
and you get a standing ovation.

184
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,840
We've put you
to so much trouble.

185
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,920
We'll be lucky if no one
is trampled to death in there!

186
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,520
BEIJING OPERA
'' FAREWELL, MY CONCUBINE''

187
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'll sit on your shoulders
for a while, then you sit on mine.

188
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,240
The king! It's the King of Chu!

189
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,320
What does it take
to become a star?

190
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,040
How many beatings?

191
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,840
When will I ever enjoy
such fame?

192
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,440
Hey! You're pissing all over me!

193
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,320
What the hell are you doing?

194
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,560
I knew you'd go back.

195
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,240
You couldn't live
without Shitou!

196
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,560
We're going to get a taste of the sword.
But I'm not afraid.

197
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,480
For me, it's like having
an itch scratched.

198
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,360
I've eaten my candied crab apple.
I'm a fucking star already.

199
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,280
Who the hell do I have
to be afraid of?

200
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,680
You little runts,
you've come back after all.

201
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,520
Good! I deserve it!

202
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,200
Why the hell did you
let them go?

203
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,280
I've had it with you!

204
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,480
Skipping class and running away
must be punished!

205
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,400
Master, I'll never do it again.
Please let me go!

206
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,760
I wouldn't dare do it again,
Master. I was wrong.

207
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,400
Who told you to let them go?
I'll kill you!

208
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,120
Master, it was I who ran away.
He had nothing to do with it.

209
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,000
Beat me instead!

210
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,080
Didn't you think you'd get yours?
I'll kill you!

211
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,840
Douzi, speak! Say something!

212
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,840
Beg for mercy!
Say he's beaten you well!

213
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,720
I'll kill you!
Running away?!

214
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,120
Speak!

215
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,840
Let's just disband the troupe!

216
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,960
You're killing Douzi!

217
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,680
I won't let you do this!

218
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,560
Master Guan!
Something terrible has happened!

219
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,080
Laizi, he--

220
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,400
The opera
'' Farewell, My Concubine''...

221
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,240
tells the story of the struggle
between the Chu and Han kings.

222
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,000
What sort of man
was the King of Chu?

223
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,160
A peerless
and invincible hero...

224
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,520
a bold and resourceful general
capable of defeating vast armies.

225
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,760
But fate wasn't on his side.

226
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,800
At Gaixia he was outwitted...

227
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,000
by the Han king.

228
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,320
As they prepared for battle,
Han's troops sang victory songs...

229
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,360
which carried on the wind
and echoed through the valley.

230
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,800
Fearing the rest of their land
was already conquered...

231
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,240
the Chu warriors fled
in a great panic.

232
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,840
Even the king was weeping.

233
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,600
No matter how resourceful
you are...

234
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,560
you can't fight fate.

235
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,920
The king had once been
all-powerful, but in the end...

236
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,440
all he had left was one woman
and one horse.

237
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,840
He tried to get his steed
to run away, but it wouldn't go.

238
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,480
He wanted his concubine to flee,
but she stayed too.

239
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,440
For the very last time,
Concubine poured wine for her king...

240
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,480
and danced for him
with a sword...

241
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,080
then cut her throat with it,
faithful to the king unto death.

242
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,760
There's a lesson in this story
for all of us...

243
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,360
that each person is responsible
for his or her own fate.

244
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
I am so strong

245
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,320
I can uproot the mountains

246
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,880
My courage is renowned

247
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,040
I've fallen on bad times
Yet even my horse

248
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,360
Won't run away to save itself

249
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,680
If it won't run away
What can I do

250
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,680
Old Man Zhang has commissioned you
to hire an opera troupe.

251
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,840
You're like a fairy godmother
to us.

252
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,880
With your patronage, the children
will have new clothes to wear.

253
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,000
Clothes are not a problem.

254
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,560
Good opera, however,
is not so simple.

255
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,600
When he was a palace eunuch...

256
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,560
Old Man Zhang attended operas
with the Empress Dowager herself.

257
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,680
So you can't put anything
over on him. Not that anyone would try.

258
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,960
You realize that if the performance
doesn't make the grade...

259
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,200
I could lose a lot of respect.
But that's nothing.

260
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,920
He could have you locked up!

261
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,840
I understand.

262
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,640
This kid's got something.

263
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,360
How many years
has he been in training?

264
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,920
Douzi, come here
and pay your respects.

265
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,080
He's got
a nice little figure too.

266
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,600
Can you sing any
old-style operas?

267
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,200
Yes, two.

268
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,680
'' Dreaming of the World
Outside the Nunnery''...

269
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,480
is the hardest female role.

270
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,400
Let's hear a bit of it.

271
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,600
''At sixteen I am a nun...

272
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,040
my hair shorn at youth's prime.

273
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,000
Yet I am by nature a boy,
not a girl.

274
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,280
Why--''

275
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,440
Mister Na, I am terribly sorry!

276
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
He's usually very good.

277
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,720
Master Guan,
I'll see you some other time.

278
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,000
You screwed up bad!
I'll teach you a lesson.

279
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,280
Open your mouth. Open it!

280
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,000
You've screwed it up
for all of us!

281
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
I'll teach you
to keep getting that line wrong!

282
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,160
Come here!

283
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,960
''I am by nature a girl,
not a boy.''

284
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,120
''At sixteen I am a nun...

285
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,840
my hair shorn at youth's prime.

286
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,480
Yet I am by nature a girl,
not a boy.

287
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,120
Why must I wear
these sexless robes?

288
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,520
I see the joyful couples pass...

289
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,440
in their splendid brocades.

290
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,480
Despite myself,
desire burns in my heart...

291
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,680
and I rend my Buddhist gown.''

292
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,240
For year upon year
'' FAREWELL, MY CONCUBINE''

293
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,680
All over the land

294
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,720
I've followed my king

295
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,200
On his military campaigns

296
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,440
Enduring the wind

297
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,280
And frost and hard toil

298
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,560
I hate only the lawless tyrant
Who has plunged our people

299
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,840
Into an abyss of misery

300
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,080
This little boy...

301
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,640
Master Guan...

302
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,840
Mister Zhang, may you live
as long as South Mountain.

303
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,720
This... little boy--

304
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,840
The people have suffered
Untold hardship and pain

305
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,520
The king has returned
to the camp

306
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,040
Your Highness

307
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:18,440
I've caused you so much grief

308
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,920
This is a token...

309
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,680
of the old man's appreciation
for the two young actors.

310
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,720
Yes, sir!

311
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,080
The Chu king would have won
with this sword!

312
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,400
If I were emperor,
then you'd be queen of the palace.

313
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,800
I want you to have
a sword like this.

314
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,160
Careful, my little man!

315
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,000
That's a real blade!

316
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,920
No need to run!

317
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,120
What's wrong?

318
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,880
The sweat stings
the scratch over my eye.

319
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,440
Aren't the two kids
going in together?

320
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,080
No. It's an old rule
around here.

321
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,880
Master Guan, I'm sorry
if you don't understand.

322
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,560
The concubine has to die
one way or the other.

323
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,400
Isn't it so?

324
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,440
Master?

325
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,120
Douzi!

326
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,640
What year is this?

327
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,640
This is... this is 1932.

328
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,360
Wrong!

329
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,720
This is still the Ching dynasty!

330
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,800
Come over here.

331
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,960
I... I want to find Shitou.

332
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
I need to pee.

333
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,720
Pee into this.
Just pee into this.

334
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,560
Don't waste it. Pee into this.

335
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,680
Come to me!

336
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,800
Douzi!

337
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,840
What's happened to you?
Say something!

338
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,520
Have you gone dumb?
Speak to me!

339
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,200
Douzi.

340
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,480
Fate has determined
each of our lots.

341
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,840
Leave him to his destiny.

342
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,080
All right, look at the camera!

343
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,840
Gentlemen, you have done
grandly for yourselves.

344
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,520
You look so dignified,
absolutely striking...

345
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,160
in any style of clothing.

346
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,880
That's it!

347
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,640
Oppose Japan's invasion
of North China!

348
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,480
Damn! It's those students again.

349
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,840
1 937
ON THE EVE OF WAR WITH JAPAN

350
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,040
Down with Japanese imperialism!

351
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,720
Aren't those the two actors
in the photograph?

352
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,440
You're playing into the hands
of theJapanese!

353
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,680
How can you put on makeup
and sing opera at a time like this?

354
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
Have you no feeling
for your country?

355
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,280
Take a good look.

356
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,400
We're Chinese too,
Chinese to the core!

357
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
Look at us, goddamn it!

358
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,880
That's right, that's right,
we're all Chinese here!

359
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,280
Chinese mustn't fight
among themselves!

360
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,920
Chinese mustn't fight
among themselves!

361
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,160
We've all descended
from the same ancestors!

362
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,000
And don't you forget it!

363
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,000
Who the hell
do they think they are?

364
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,360
Why don't they go out
and fight the Japanese soldiers?

365
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,160
Would they dare do that?

366
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,920
Those students!

367
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
They are only trying
to find a way...

368
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,360
to kill their spare time!

369
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,080
The one who was yelling the loudest
would make a good actor.

370
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,120
Remember the first time we performed
'' Farewell, My Concubine''?

371
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,600
Only you remember
that kind of thing.

372
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,600
Master Duan!
How could you forget?

373
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,240
It was Mister Zhang's birthday party.
I am the one who introduced you to him.

374
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,520
Where you two became stars!

375
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,160
Dieyi! It has become
a coffin shop now!

376
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,080
I went there yesterday.

377
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,520
I know you've been looking
for the sword, but it's long gone.

378
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,400
SHITOU AND DOUZI,
NOW FAMOUS ACTORS...

379
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,000
HAVE TAKEN THE STAGE NAMES
DUAN XIAOLOU AND CHENG DI EYI.

380
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,880
Cheng Dieyi! Cheng Dieyi!

381
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,720
Candied crab apples for sale!

382
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,480
There's a sea of awestruck people
in there...

383
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,680
craning their necks
to catch a glimpse of their idols.

384
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,920
Master Yuan has come especially
to see you perform tonight.

385
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,440
It's a great honor for us.

386
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,080
There'll be a slight delay!

387
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,440
Mister Duan...

388
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,280
the orchestra's been warming up
for ages. Please hurry!

389
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,400
I know. Let me first practice
a few scales.

390
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,560
That way they know
they're getting their money's worth.

391
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,480
Master Yuan!

392
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,760
Year after year
all over the land

393
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,120
I've followed my king

394
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,640
On his military campaigns

395
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:08,760
Enduring wind

396
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,680
And frost and hard toil

397
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,240
You be the judge.

398
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,960
Has he not blurred
the distinction between theater and...

399
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,400
male and female?

400
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,080
I hate only the lawless tyrant
Who plunged our people

401
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,120
Into an abyss of misery

402
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,480
Your Highness

403
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:07,520
I've caused you

404
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:13,280
So much grief

405
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,880
So, Master Yuan has come
to see us tonight.

406
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,240
I know. I sang so loudly,
I drowned out the horns.

407
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,120
But I wanted him to know
that even without his patronage...

408
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,400
we'd still be the talk of the town
here in Beijing.

409
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,120
You shouldn't exert yourself
like that.

410
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,920
Don't worry.

411
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,280
At key moments...

412
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,600
I squeezed my waist
with my hands...

413
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,120
so I wouldn't run out of breath.

414
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,520
Here?

415
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,320
No.

416
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,920
Here?

417
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,440
Stop it!

418
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,920
Master Yuan!

419
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,640
It's an honor.

420
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,240
Your reputation turns out to be
well-deserved.

421
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,440
You're very kind.

422
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,760
Please accept a small,
rather slapdash token of my esteem.

423
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,520
I don't believe
the Empress Dowager herself...

424
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,040
ever bestowed such a gift
upon her favorite actors.

425
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,360
If so, I never heard of it!

426
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,480
Master Yuan, how can our Dieyi
be worthy of your favor?

427
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,120
'' Farewell, My Concubine''
has a long history.

428
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,720
It evolved from the old-style opera
''Story of the Precious One.''

429
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,840
Many famous actors
have fallen down in this role.

430
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,480
Your evocation of Concubine Yu
lifts it into a higher realm.

431
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,040
Impressive.

432
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,480
For a moment or two...

433
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,320
this Yuan fellow
was so entranced...

434
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,040
he believed Concubine Yu
had actually come back to life!

435
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,560
Master Duan...

436
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,800
when the king returns to camp
and meets Concubine Yu...

437
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,320
custom has it--

438
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,640
Yes, Master Yuan?

439
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:10,440
Custom has it he takes seven steps.
You take but five.

440
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,160
If the King of Chu fails to bear himself
with majestic dignity...

441
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,080
he's little better than a gangster
putting on airs!

442
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,400
Master Yuan, you are a master
of the theater arts.

443
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,760
You are an expert in all the varieties
and facets of opera.

444
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,360
Could we doubt your word?

445
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,880
Indeed, we are presumptuous
to parade our meager talents...

446
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,600
in the theaters of Beijing.

447
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,280
Please give us the benefit
of your advice and criticism.

448
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,520
If it's not beneath you,
I'd like to invite you...

449
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,280
to my humble home for some wine.

450
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,240
There is still so much
to be said about this opera.

451
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,480
I'm terribly sorry, Master Yuan.

452
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,600
I've another
drinking engagement...

453
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,440
with a courtesan.

454
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,200
You have other
refined entertainments planned.

455
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,640
Excellent.

456
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,200
And Mister Cheng?

457
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,040
Ah, then we shall exchange
poetic thoughts some other day.

458
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,000
Excuse me.

459
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,080
Master Yuan,
thank you for coming.

460
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,720
Dieyi! I am leaving too.

461
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,720
Girls! Come entertain our guest.

462
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,800
Mister Duan, this way please.

463
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,400
We haven't seen you for a while,
Mister Duan. We've missed you.

464
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,480
I'd like to see Miss Juxian.

465
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,080
Ah, how shall I put it?

466
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,320
You should have said something...
earlier.

467
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,600
She's not here at the moment.

468
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,080
She was asked out to dinner.

469
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,160
What can be done?
How about this?

470
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,760
We'll find you
a good substitute.

471
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,000
Caifeng, come keep Mister Duan
company.

472
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,000
I'll take my leave.

473
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,480
Tell me the truth.
Where is Juxian really?

474
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,520
Upstairs or down?

475
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,520
The phoenix roosts
on the highest branches, of course!

476
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,640
But she's pretty high-class.
You reckon she'll go for you?

477
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,640
You bet!

478
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,240
I specialize in high-class.

479
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,920
Oh, Miss Juxian--

480
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,960
Bastards!
Okay, we're bastards!

481
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,120
Go ahead then.
What are you waiting for?

482
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,640
I'll bet those guys
make mincemeat out of you!

483
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,120
I'm really angry now!

484
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,040
We like it when you're angry!

485
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,880
Cut it out or I'll jump!

486
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,240
Jump! I'll follow on your heels.

487
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,040
Such a death would be ecstasy.
I'd be a very happy ghost.

488
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,240
If you die, we'll all die
and be the planks in your coffin.

489
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,520
Xiaolou!

490
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,840
These guys are revolting!

491
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,880
They were forcing me
to drink wine from their mouths.

492
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,280
Come on, assholes. Jump!

493
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,840
This lady has done it.
Now it's your turn!

494
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,640
Bastards!
Pack of fucking sissies!

495
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,480
All right, if we have
to go down, let's go!

496
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,720
Oh, it's Mister Duan!

497
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,880
Listen, we're all here
to have a good time...

498
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,320
and spend lots of money.

499
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,800
So let's not pick fights
with each other.

500
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,440
Keep out of it, and get lost.

501
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,880
Don't get upset.

502
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,240
Scared?

503
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,720
Juxian, this is really
all your fault.

504
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,560
Didn't you tell these gentlemen
today's a special day?

505
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,600
That we decided to announce
our engagement today?

506
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,880
That's right!

507
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,240
Today is the lady's happy day.

508
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,800
Aren't you going
to offer congratulations?

509
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,000
Drink a toast to me!

510
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,240
Think you can fool us
with this little act?

511
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,080
Gentlemen, on this,
my happiest day...

512
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,600
allow me to drink
to all of you!

513
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,920
And now,
something to sober you up.

514
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,120
Wish us well.

515
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,160
I heard you got into a fight
at the House of Blossoms.

516
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,760
You know the old story...

517
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,920
about Pan Jinlian's husband
meeting the man who screwed her?

518
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,040
Did he have any choice
but to fight?

519
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,480
Does this mean there's
a Pan Jinlian in your life?

520
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,960
What are you saying?
What do you want to hear?

521
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,440
I was just fooling around.

522
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,440
You know, damsel in distress
and all that.

523
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,560
Come with me sometime.
You'll see what it's like.

524
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,560
I'm sorry. I really am!

525
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,960
I wasn't thinking. I really put
my foot in it this time.

526
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,240
I'm a damn fool.

527
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,240
Have you forgotten
the secret of our success?

528
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,320
Don't you remember
our teacher's words?

529
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,520
Which words were they?

530
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,360
''Stick together
until the day you die.''

531
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,560
I want you to be with me.

532
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,120
I mean...

533
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,680
I want to be with you
the rest of my life.

534
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,000
We've come this far together,
haven't we?

535
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,760
It's not enough.
I'm talking about a lifetime.

536
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,640
One year, one month, one day,
even one second less...

537
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,480
makes it less than a lifetime!

538
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,600
Dieyi, you really are obsessed.

539
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:30,600
Your obsession with the stage
carries over into your everyday life.

540
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,400
But how are we going
to get through the days...

541
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,800
and make it in the real world
among ordinary people?

542
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,800
Give me a hand with my makeup,
will you?

543
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,080
So you want to become
a rich man's wife!

544
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,800
Go live out
this goddamn fantasy, then.

545
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,720
Don't think that
when you walk out this door...

546
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,720
you'll become a lady of virtue!

547
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,400
You think the wolves and tigers
won't recognize your scent anymore?

548
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,320
I'm so scared!

549
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,000
Let me tell you something.

550
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,680
Once a whore, always a whore.

551
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,960
Just remember that.

552
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,880
This is your fate!

553
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,840
Fine. See you around.

554
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,320
Master Yuan has presented you
with a pennant.

555
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,040
It reads,
''The Beauty of the Age.''

556
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,760
What are you doing here?

557
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,480
What is it, Juxian?

558
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,600
Come on in!

559
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,000
No, you come out!

560
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,120
What are you doing barefoot
on such a cold day?

561
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,240
What's happened?

562
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,440
I was kicked out.

563
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,680
The House of Blossoms
won't keep an engaged woman.

564
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,880
Come. Let me introduce you.

565
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,040
This is Miss Juxian.

566
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
This is my stage brother, Dieyi.

567
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,520
You may have seen him
as Concubine Yu.

568
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:09,280
Xiaolou speaks of you so often,
I feel like we're old friends.

569
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,040
Miss Juxian.
Excuse me, I must be going.

570
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:29,360
Xiaolou, that day
at the House of Blossoms...

571
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,960
if you hadn't caught me,
I'd be six feet under by now.

572
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,000
Remember, it was you
who proposed to me.

573
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,760
I'm used to hardship.

574
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,760
If you take me in...

575
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,240
I'll wait on you hand and foot.

576
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,000
If you tire of me,
I'll kill myself.

577
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,600
No big deal, really.

578
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,440
What a dragon lady!

579
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,280
Incredible!
This is a major production.

580
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,280
When's the performance of...

581
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,600
''Candlelit Night
in the Bridal Chamber''?

582
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,760
Tonight.

583
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,080
Hold on.

584
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,200
I want a formal
engagement ceremony...

585
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,600
to which the entire company
is invited.

586
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,800
I want to enter your home
as a proper bride.

587
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,000
You don't think I plan
to cut corners, do you?

588
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,480
The formal engagement ceremony
will be tonight.

589
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,880
Gentlemen, we request
the pleasure of your company.

590
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,880
Miss Juxian...

591
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,400
where did you study opera?

592
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,800
Me, study opera?
What makes you think I studied opera?

593
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,960
Just the way you're overplaying
your part.

594
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,240
Dieyi, she's going to be
your sister-in-law.

595
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,240
Be nice.

596
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,760
Also, at the engagement party
tonight...

597
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,120
I'd like you to be best man.

598
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,880
I haven't learned the opera
''Gangster King and His Whore.''

599
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,120
Our teacher never taught us
that one.

600
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,920
What are you talking about?

601
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,400
Dieyi, Xiaolou has only
the nicest things to say about you..

602
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,280
both in public and in private.

603
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,000
Don't leave!

604
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,280
Where are you going?

605
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,200
None of your business.

606
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,120
Xiaolou!

607
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,040
Please don't go!

608
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,840
Master Yuan wants us
to visit him tonight.

609
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,920
He wants to become our patron.

610
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:17,000
Who does he think he is?
No one tells me what to do.

611
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:21,000
I'm just a fake king.
You really are Concubine Yu.

612
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,120
Let him patronize you
if you like.

613
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,600
Xiaolou!

614
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,840
This feather headpiece
is rare and precious.

615
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,640
The feathers are collected
from the tails of live peacocks.

616
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,560
That's the secret...

617
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,200
to keeping the feathers
soft and colorful.

618
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,760
I'll be waiting for you.

619
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:54,520
In this world, there is foulness
in both men and women.

620
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,520
Only the bodhisattva embodies
both male and female essences.

621
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,680
Such ecstasy!

622
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,680
This sword has a history.

623
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,280
It once belonged
to the eunuch Zhang.

624
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,920
When Zhang went bankrupt,
I went to great trouble to acquire it.

625
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,040
I can see from this...

626
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,720
you're old acquaintances.

627
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,720
Amazing. One searches
far and wide for something...

628
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,800
only to stumble upon it
by chance.

629
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,520
Like it?

630
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,760
I--

631
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,280
Let's not have any vulgar talk
of money between us.

632
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,800
A precious sword is the classic gift
for one's most intimate friend.

633
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,560
Mister Cheng...

634
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,200
will you be
my most intimate friend?

635
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,600
The soldiers of Han

636
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,960
Have invaded

637
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,640
The songs of Chu

638
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,400
Can be heard on all sides

639
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,080
Since the good king

640
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,360
Has lost his fighting spirit

641
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:55,240
Why should his humble concubine

642
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,600
Value her life

643
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,400
Don't!

644
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,680
It's a real sword!

645
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:32,200
''A smile ushers in the spring.

646
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,600
A tear does darken
all the world.

647
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,160
How truly does this befit you.

648
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,840
Only you are possessed
of such charm.''

649
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,680
Where are you going?

650
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,480
He's crazy.

651
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,720
Ah, Mister Cheng.
I knew you'd come.

652
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,600
We saved a seat
at the head table for you.

653
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,800
Xiaolou! Xiaolou!

654
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,640
Well, if it isn't Dieyi!

655
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:57,040
It's a good thing you showed up.

656
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,680
Otherwise--

657
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,000
Have a look at this.

658
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,400
What a sword!

659
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,160
But we're not on stage.
What would I want with a sword?

660
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,320
Dieyi, you've come so late.

661
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,320
I ought to punish you
by making you drink this.

662
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,400
Yes, drink up!

663
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,920
My gratitude, Miss Juxian.

664
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,000
Dieyi? Mister Cheng!

665
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,880
Xiaolou...

666
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,480
from now on, we'll no longer
perform together.

667
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,320
Mister Cheng, you can't do this!

668
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,960
This isn't-The fans won't--

669
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,000
This is terrible!

670
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:12,040
Japanese troops
have entered the city!

671
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,360
Dieyi. Where is Dieyi?

672
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,040
BEIJING OPERA
''THE DRUNKEN CONCUBINE''

673
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:16,880
Dieyi said it looks better
if the eyebrow is very high.

674
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,960
Please! Your troops are
upsetting the performance.

675
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,560
Look at this, Mister Duan.

676
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:47,320
I won't stand for it! Tell him
to take it off immediately.

677
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,360
Xiaolou!

678
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,560
What's the fuss?
It's only a costume.

679
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,240
If it was the shroud
from your grandma's coffin...

680
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,840
you'd still have
to give it to me.

681
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,960
Understand me, lowlife?

682
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,760
Tell the Japanese
I'll be there right away.

683
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,960
Hold on a moment.

684
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,920
It's not some private party.

685
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,600
They're blackmailing you to sing
for them.

686
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,480
On the other hand,
you're the only one...

687
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,480
who can save Xiaolou.

688
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,800
On the other hand,
if anything happened to you...

689
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,360
this theater of mine would--

690
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,520
All right, go then.

691
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,840
Miss Juxian, what are you doing?

692
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,120
Mister Cheng isn't at home!

693
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,720
Where's Dieyi? Dieyi?

694
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,040
Hurry! I've heard the Japanese
feed prisoners to their dogs!

695
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,560
And you know Xiaolou's temper.

696
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,640
If you delay, he might not have
a life to save!

697
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,760
Dieyi!

698
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,880
But you allowed them
to take him away in the first place.

699
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,320
What are you saying?

700
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,200
Xiaolou has looked after you
since you were small.

701
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,840
Glad you realize that.

702
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,520
Mister Na, would you mind
leaving the room for a moment?

703
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,560
I have something to say to Dieyi
in private.

704
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,320
Everyone says Miss Juxian
is quite clever...

705
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,440
and her timing in this case
certainly proves it.

706
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,280
We're all trying to help Xiaolou.
Talk it over.

707
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,040
How about a clear answer?
Are you going or not?

708
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,280
Say something!

709
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,800
I know what's on your mind.

710
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,680
I have a proposal.

711
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,200
If you can get Xiaolou
out of there in one piece...

712
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,000
I'll go back
to the House of Blossoms.

713
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,600
I'll keep away from both of you.
How's that?

714
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:46,520
At the House of Blossoms,
you don't have to worry about much.

715
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,600
Life is a lot simpler there.

716
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,840
Just remember, you said it,
not me.

717
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,800
I give my word.

718
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,520
KUEN-STYLE OPERA
'' PEONY PAVILION''

719
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:52,760
The flowers have blossomed

720
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:58,720
Their season is past

721
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:04,280
All has fallen

722
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:09,640
Into ruin and decay

723
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,440
Xiaolou!

724
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,960
My brother!

725
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,800
Xiaolou, are you all right?

726
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,240
Did you sing for theJapanese?

727
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,560
There's one called Aoki.
He genuinely likes opera.

728
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,960
Xiaolou!

729
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,240
All right. Come here!

730
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,600
Let me have another drink!

731
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,040
Okay. I'll drink one for you.

732
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,440
Come on!

733
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,120
I think this opera,
'' Farewell, My Concubine''...

734
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,840
has turned into...

735
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,360
'' Farewell, My King.''

736
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,360
The king's really irrelevant.

737
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:02,320
Drink this and your voice
will pierce the heavens...

738
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,480
yet be tender and more fluid
than water.

739
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,520
Don't move!

740
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,200
Forget the opera.

741
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:58,120
Let's just live a quiet life.

742
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,320
We'll have
a fat little baby boy.

743
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:06,080
Then I'll have everything
I want. That's enough.

744
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,440
No more opera.

745
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,400
Let's go! Let's go!

746
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,680
See you around, Xiaolou!

747
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,600
Wait! You forgot something.

748
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:01,840
Don't think he's stupid!
Give him back the money!

749
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,240
We need the money!

750
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:11,040
Get lost!

751
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,520
Some friends they are!

752
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:20,800
They only wanted
to take advantage of us.

753
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,640
Get a job? I am an actor.

754
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,760
What else do you want me to do!

755
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,200
You are the one who doesn't want me
to sing opera anymore. Now what?

756
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:36,160
Get a job? That's easy for you to say.
I know nothing but opera.

757
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,920
Happy now?

758
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,160
You're not mad at me, are you?

759
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,960
Here, take this.

760
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,160
Are you finished?

761
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,400
All right. I knew
I shouldn't have said that.

762
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,080
But your friends really leave me
no choice.

763
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,000
They are a bad influence!

764
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,720
Master Kwang wants you
to work for him.

765
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,760
I am not going.
How could I face my master?

766
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:20,480
Watch out, here I come.

767
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,680
Sir, they're here!

768
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,520
Who?
Dieyi and Xiaolou.

769
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,240
They came as soon as they heard
you wanted to see them.

770
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,320
Oh, this really is something!

771
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,280
Master!

772
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,600
The two famous actors are here!

773
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,400
We are unworthy of you.

774
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:49,640
You are so kind to come by.

775
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,560
I'm deeply honored.

776
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,480
Please, have a seat.

777
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,960
Let this decrepit old man
pay his respects.

778
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,160
Master, we wouldn't presume.

779
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:05,920
Wouldn't presume!
What wouldn't you presume?!

780
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,040
Cheng Dieyi...

781
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:15,920
Xiaolou helped make you
what you are today.

782
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,280
Now he's not singing anymore.

783
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,920
It's time for you
to give him a hand.

784
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,320
Come on!

785
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,560
Do it!

786
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,960
Little Douzi!

787
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,240
Little Shitou!

788
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:04,800
There's been a lot of water
under the bridge...

789
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:08,360
since you were children.

790
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,920
Now...

791
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,760
you're great actors,
but you're arrogant.

792
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:20,080
But have you forgotten?

793
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,840
Don't you have the heart
for it anymore?

794
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:35,120
Did I tell you to spoil
and indulge him?

795
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:39,160
Did I tell you
to cover up for him?

796
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:43,080
Did I tell you to sit by
while he wastes his talents?

797
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:45,280
Master!

798
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,440
It's my fault. I'm a failure.

799
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,360
Punish me!

800
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,760
Listen to me, grandpa.

801
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,880
Can you guess
what I have to say?

802
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,760
Xiaolou belongs to me
these days.

803
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,520
If you want to hit him,
you've got to notify me first.

804
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,680
Juxian!

805
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:06,880
It's that girl from the
House of Blossoms, isn't it?

806
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:11,200
Today, you are
our number one guest.

807
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,200
Make yourself comfortable.

808
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:17,120
Have a drink and a look around.

809
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:21,360
Please.

810
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:32,000
Did I teach you to indulge
yourself and go whoring?

811
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,680
Did I teach you
to pawn your costumes?

812
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,400
To desecrate the opera?

813
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,360
Good! I deserve it!

814
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:44,920
Hold on!

815
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:50,400
If he's desecrating the opera,
you ought to punish him.

816
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,760
But don't you think
his stage brother...

817
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,600
has a part in it as well?

818
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:59,120
Juxian!

819
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:03,640
I'm from the House of Blossoms.

820
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,280
This is none of my business...

821
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:08,800
but as their teacher...

822
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:11,320
shouldn't you listen
to both sides of the story?

823
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,680
Shut up! This is between us men!
Keep out of it!

824
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,480
Duan Xiaolou...

825
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,320
you really are a tender soul!

826
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,280
Hit me again!
If you don't shut up, I'll kill you.

827
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:39,880
Don't!

828
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,160
Go ahead.

829
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:46,880
You'll take two lives at once.

830
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,680
The Duan family line
will stop with you!

831
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,680
Who told you to stand up?

832
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:05,320
Shitou,
are you paying attention?

833
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,600
You're going to be a father.

834
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:11,240
If you keep wasting your time
and lose your skills...

835
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:16,040
how are you going to afford
a celebration for the baby?

836
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,920
Kneel closer to one another!

837
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,240
Closer!

838
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,480
Get to work!

839
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,120
Straighten up!

840
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,600
Stretch those legs! Stretch!

841
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,400
Wait a minute!

842
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:59,480
You're practicing
'' Fleeing by Night,'' aren't you?

843
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,120
You're playing Lin Chong.
Who's this Lin Chong?

844
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:07,080
He's head of the palace guard,
not some sneaky little thief.

845
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,760
Take this.

846
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,880
Attention, everyone!

847
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,120
This is what a great hero
is like.

848
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:25,000
''A man doesn't
lightly shed his tears...

849
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,560
unless his heart has broken.''

850
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:53,240
Don't! Master told me to kneel
for seven days as punishment.

851
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,040
The troupe has disbanded.

852
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,960
What's the point
of this idiotic kneeling?

853
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:00,240
Master said that only you
can make yourself a great actor.

854
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:05,120
Everyone else has left.
You ought to go home too.

855
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:08,080
I was found on the street as a baby.
I've got no other home.

856
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,520
Do you know who found you?

857
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:16,520
No! They said if I knew, I'd get
a swelled head and wouldn't work hard.

858
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,320
Do you still want to sing opera?

859
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,440
Yes, even if I have to beg
to support myself!.

860
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,320
What's your name?

861
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,800
Xiao Si.

862
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,480
Xiao Si.

863
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,040
1 945
THE JAPANESE SURRENDER...

864
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:43,680
AS CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S
NATIONALIST ARMY RETAKES BEIJING.

865
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,840
I hear the talk of the soldiers

866
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:44,760
Xiao Si, go tell the manager
to avoid trouble.

867
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:50,320
And it is all about running away

868
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:59,840
What's this?
Why aren't you singing?

869
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,760
Don't make trouble!

870
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,120
Don't go, Xiaolou.
It's not worth it!

871
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,480
Soldiers! Gentlemen!

872
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:43,960
Waving flashlights is not
acceptable behavior in the theater.

873
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,520
Even the Japanese
didn't do this sort of thing.

874
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,800
Everyone's here for the opera.
Please return to your seats.

875
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,080
Well put.
Back to your seats, everyone!

876
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:04,760
But can we let him get away
with speaking up for the Japanese?

877
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,560
No!

878
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:07,640
Get him!

879
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,360
Fuck your mother!

880
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,200
Xiaolou!

881
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,960
Xiaolou!

882
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,160
Leave him alone!

883
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,280
Juxian!

884
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,800
Hurry!

885
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,040
I'm here, Juxian.

886
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,080
Get her a stool. Hurry!

887
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,920
We have to get her
to a hospital.

888
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:11,520
Save her first
and worry about the baby later.

889
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,440
Let us through!

890
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,440
There was only
a minor disturbance.

891
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,720
Is such a show of force
really necessary?

892
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,200
You can fine us.

893
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,480
Why do you need
to arrest anyone?

894
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,320
The theater's been trashed,
people beaten...

895
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,800
and you still want
to arrest him?

896
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,520
Why?

897
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,360
What for?

898
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,960
Cheng Dieyi betrayed the country
to the Japanese.

899
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,120
Move it!

900
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,880
How can you say that about him?

901
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,280
Teacher, teacher!

902
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,440
Mister Duan!

903
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,640
Mister Duan, I'm afraid
she's lost the baby.

904
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:41,000
Xiaolou, I'm so sorry.

905
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:47,040
Go help Dieyi
if he's more important to you.

906
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:13,200
I don't know whether Dieyi
goes looking for trouble...

907
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:16,080
or if it's trouble
that comes looking for him.

908
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:19,240
But sooner or later,
they always meet.

909
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,600
Whenever you're with him,
my heart's in my throat.

910
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:35,080
Now that I've lost our child,
you're all I have left.

911
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:40,440
I don't care if I have to beg
with you on the streets.

912
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:44,200
All I ask...

913
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,120
is peace of mind.

914
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:57,040
If you help him now,
we'll no longer owe him anything.

915
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:00,000
Don't perform with him anymore.

916
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:06,040
Promise me this.
Put it in writing.

917
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,280
Master Yuan...

918
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:39,600
Dieyi's life is in your hands.

919
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:46,600
Count this.
If it's not enough--

920
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:51,880
If only you'll save Dieyi...

921
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,680
we'll give all our earnings
for the next three years.

922
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:59,760
You think I need your money
to keep my birds from starving?

923
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,280
And this gentleman is...?

924
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,480
Don't you recognize Xiaolou?

925
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:15,400
He plays the king
to Dieyi's concubine.

926
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,040
Then it should be he
who saves Concubine Yu!

927
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:24,000
My dear man, that's only a play!

928
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:29,400
All Beijing knows that Master Yu
is the true king of the theater!

929
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:32,560
It's true.

930
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:37,240
Speaking of theater, I'd like to
ask Mister Duan something.

931
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:41,200
When the king returns
to see Concubine Yu...

932
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,600
how many steps should he take?

933
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:49,800
Seven.

934
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,560
Show me.

935
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,920
Come on, show me!

936
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,880
Master Yuan.

937
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:11,120
Is this the honorable home
of Mister Yuan?

938
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:18,400
When a man called Cheng Dieyi
was arrested, he said...

939
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,520
the owner of this sword
would be able to rescue him.

940
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:25,320
Have a look.
Do you recognize it?

941
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:43,120
From your expression, I see I've come
to the right place.

942
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:48,400
Good. I'll put the sword here.

943
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:54,440
I'm so relieved
to have found its owner.

944
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:03,360
But sometimes one's hopes
are misplaced.

945
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:07,960
Master Yuan,
you mustn't blame Dieyi.

946
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,640
I see.

947
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:21,200
He didn't say I...
I put him up to it, did he?

948
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:25,800
If you were involved...

949
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,480
he wouldn't be in trouble,
would he?

950
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,200
True!

951
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:35,800
Oh, dear!

952
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:38,560
There's a roomful of reporters
waiting at home.

953
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:40,400
Xiaolou, Mister Na, let's go.

954
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,320
Wait a moment! Let's talk.

955
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:54,960
Master Yuan asked me
to talk to you.

956
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:58,320
Tomorrow in court...

957
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:02,160
say the Japanese
put a gun to your head.

958
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:04,560
Say they tortured you.

959
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,200
Master Yuan has made arrangements
for everything else.

960
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:20,880
This is from Xiaolou.

961
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:32,200
Dieyi, don't be angry with us.

962
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:35,440
The death of Xiaolou's child...

963
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,040
was karmic retribution
for your partnership.

964
01:48:56,440 --> 01:49:00,760
After you get out of here,
just go your own way.

965
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:27,040
Cheng Dieyi betrayed the country
by performing for theJapanese.

966
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,400
You encouraged the enemy
and disgraced your people.

967
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,000
Aoki continued to resist
even after Japan officially surrendered.

968
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,280
That's why we shot him
when we found him.

969
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:41,520
We've collected these pictures
as evidence...

970
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:46,800
and they confirm the defendant
sang for the Japanese.

971
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:56,480
We call on the witnesses Yuan Shiqing,
Duan Xiaolou and Na Kun.

972
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:06,360
The government has always
been good to me.

973
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:08,560
I wouldn't dare
deceive the court.

974
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:13,080
Nor would I betray the laws
of Heaven or my own conscience.

975
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:19,800
Cheng Dieyi was taken away
in handcuffs by the Japanese.

976
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:25,840
They put a gun
to the back of his neck.

977
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:31,280
Duan Xiaolou!
Uh, it's true.

978
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:34,840
The Japanese beat up
my stage brother.

979
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,040
Exactly as Master Yuan
has just described.

980
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:38,960
Na Kun!

981
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:43,360
He--

982
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:49,920
The prosecutor claims Cheng
performed obscene material.

983
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:55,840
That is ridiculous!

984
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:08,680
Cheng performed highlights
from '' Peony Pavilion'' that night.

985
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:14,720
Anyone with any common sense
knows that...

986
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:17,320
'' Peony Pavilion'' is
the quintessential Chinese opera.

987
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:22,680
How can that be obscene
to the prosecutor's eye?

988
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:28,920
How dare they insult
our tradition and culture like this!

989
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:35,080
Who's disparaging
Chinese tradition...

990
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:40,640
and disrespecting its culture?

991
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,800
We ask the accused, Cheng Dieyi:

992
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:51,960
Have the witnesses
told the truth?

993
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:03,280
The court wishes to hear...

994
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:07,120
what the accused has to say.

995
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,120
Cheng Dieyi!

996
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,720
I sang for the Japanese.

997
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,560
I hate the Japanese too.

998
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:31,640
But they didn't lay a hand
on me.

999
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:37,800
Cheng Dieyi...

1000
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:44,400
you have the right and duty
to clear your name.

1001
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:52,560
Reconsider carefully
and tell us again what happened.

1002
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,600
If Aoki had lived...

1003
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:02,160
he'd have taken
the Beijing Opera to Japan.

1004
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,880
Why don't you just kill me?

1005
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,600
Master Yuan, Master Yuan!

1006
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:24,400
How did you people get in here?

1007
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:35,040
Please, Master Yuan,
don't leave.

1008
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,440
What does it matter?
He's as good as dead.

1009
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:43,000
Master Yuan, you can't go.
If you go, he's finished for sure.

1010
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:46,560
The court has made its decision.

1011
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:50,680
The case of the traitor
Cheng Dieyi is suspended.

1012
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:56,720
The accused is released
under bond.

1013
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,280
Court dismissed!

1014
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:04,400
What's going on?

1015
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:12,840
Dieyi, are you playing with me,
goddamn it?

1016
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:26,360
Good-bye, Mister Cheng.

1017
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,080
This way, Mister Cheng.

1018
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:36,240
NATIONALIST HEADQUARTERS

1019
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,640
The commander has arrived.

1020
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,520
Attention!

1021
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:14,200
KUEN-STYLE OPERA
'' PEONY PAVILION''

1022
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,960
Chunxiang!

1023
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:33,280
Miss!

1024
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:39,040
How can one know
spring's color...

1025
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:44,320
unless one visits the garden?

1026
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:51,800
'' Ma, did you get my last letter?

1027
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:57,480
Everything's fine here.
Don't worry about me.

1028
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:02,840
My stage brother Xiaolou
looks after me with great kindness.

1029
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:09,440
We rehearse by day
and perform at night...

1030
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:12,720
just like before.

1031
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:18,960
-The world's not what it used to be,
but all we ask is a peaceful life.

1032
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:25,560
We sing and get paid for it.
What more could you want?''

1033
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:29,880
Lucky, the cat, wants you
to blow more opium smoke at her.

1034
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:32,680
See that?
It sure makes her come to life!

1035
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:36,480
Dieyi, should I mail this to...?

1036
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:38,400
The usual address.
Done!

1037
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:46,200
All you classic consumptive heroines
burn your letters.

1038
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:53,560
Have you seen this?

1039
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,520
Do you want it?

1040
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:02,000
If you don't, I'll tear it up.

1041
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,960
I'll do it!

1042
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:23,120
Xiao Si!

1043
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:26,000
I gave Master Duan the sword
returned to you by Master Yuan.

1044
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:47,840
The river's course is twisted,
but in the end it flows to the sea.

1045
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:51,400
But what gulf still lies
between our concubine and our king?

1046
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,120
Talk to each other already.

1047
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:56,000
The Han king
is about to enter the city!

1048
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:11,840
1948 THE EVE OF
THE NATIONALIST EVACUATION
TO TAIWAN

1049
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,680
THE COMMUNISTS HAVE
SURROUNDED THE CITY.

1050
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:20,840
For better or worse, we Manchus
ruled for three centuries.

1051
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:26,600
The Republic's only just begun,
and already it's being overthrown.

1052
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:31,680
But even the Communists
have to have opera.

1053
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:34,080
The empire may change hands,
but rest assured...

1054
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:37,920
you'll still get top billing
at the celebrations for the new regime.

1055
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:42,880
We're just waiting to see
what their money looks like.

1056
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:46,440
Well, do you still want to fight
their ragtag troops?

1057
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,080
Of course I'll fight them...
if they don't behave themselves.

1058
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:54,200
If you had Master Yuan's class,
you'd prosper...

1059
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:57,280
no matter who was in power.

1060
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,280
It's not the same for us!

1061
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,200
Do you recognize me?

1062
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:20,600
Cigarettes! Buy one!

1063
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:29,600
Mister Zhang, don't you know us?

1064
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:33,160
Buy a pack!

1065
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:51,680
1949 THE COMMUNIST PEOPLE'S
LIBERATION ARMY ENTERS BEIJING.

1066
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:39,440
Xiao Si...

1067
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:41,440
have them sing whatever
the crowd wants to hear.

1068
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:43,240
Just avoid a scene.

1069
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,320
Honorable guests...

1070
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,280
I'm very sorry.

1071
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:57,080
Today my fellow actor is--

1072
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:42,320
Mister Cheng, if you can't take it,
have another smoke.

1073
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:45,320
Xiao Si, go call Mister Duan.

1074
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:49,640
Down with the counter-revolutionary
Yuan Shiqing!

1075
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:54,800
Yuan Shiqing is an enemy
of the People and he must die!

1076
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:03,240
We must raise our level of vigil
and see what has been going on!

1077
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:10,720
Yuan Shiqing
has always opposed...

1078
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,800
the Communist Party
and the People.

1079
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:16,960
He has harmed his community
and is guilty of monstrous crimes.

1080
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:20,680
Only execution can satisfy
the People's anger!

1081
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:25,680
Down with the counter-revolutionary
Yuan Shiqing!

1082
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:31,520
Down with the tyrant
of the opera world, Yuan Shiqing!

1083
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:39,320
Death to Yuan Shiqing!

1084
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:42,360
Execute Yuan Shiqing!

1085
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,560
Take him away!

1086
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:06,720
Only execution can satisfy
the People's anger?

1087
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:12,000
Just like that?

1088
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,400
They're going to kill
Master Yuan?

1089
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:17,480
Keep your voice down.

1090
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:45,840
Let me go! Release me!

1091
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:48,720
Fuck you!

1092
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:52,680
Stop carrying on!

1093
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:06,200
Are you listening?
You'll get over it with time.

1094
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:08,680
Good, calm down.
Everything will be okay.

1095
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:10,320
Fuck you!

1096
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:18,000
Cut it out or I'll hit you!

1097
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,520
How is he?

1098
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:44,280
We may need to wean him
from the opium slowly.

1099
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:46,200
Keep an eye on him.
Don't let him hurt himself.

1100
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:48,280
Don't go, Xiaolou.

1101
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:50,680
If he really wants to overcome
his addiction...

1102
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:54,920
he's going to have to go through hell!
This is just the start.

1103
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:33,000
My hand is freezing!

1104
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:42,480
It feels like ice.

1105
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:48,240
My hand is freezing!

1106
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:55,600
It feels like ice.

1107
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:00,800
My hand is freezing.

1108
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:04,160
It's okay.

1109
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,720
Everything's all right.

1110
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:15,360
The sky of the liberated areas
is clear and blue.

1111
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:18,840
The people of the liberated
areas are all very happy.

1112
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,720
Mrs. Duan!

1113
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:27,360
Where were you?

1114
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:29,360
A meeting.

1115
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:31,000
A meeting?

1116
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,720
Xiaolou,
the whole troupe's come.

1117
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,760
Come on in. Quick!

1118
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:48,480
Ah, a costume change!

1119
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:55,080
Thank you all for coming to see me.
I'm fine now.

1120
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:58,160
Sounds easy now.
You didn't see him suffer!

1121
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:00,080
Dieyi, get out of bed.

1122
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:02,840
All of Beijing is waiting
with bated breath...

1123
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:06,280
for the next appearance
of the King and his Concubine!

1124
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:09,760
It'll be the goddamn golden hit
of a golden era.

1125
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:21,560
You've asked me to say a few words.
I'm not sure how to put it.

1126
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:26,640
I think these modern operas
are interesting...

1127
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:32,000
but the costumes
aren't very attractive.

1128
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,440
The backdrops are too realistic.
Nothing pleases the eye.

1129
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:38,040
Yet Beijing Opera puts
great value on ambiance.

1130
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:43,800
Song recital, movement and acrobatics
are part of this ambiance.

1131
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:47,720
But if you're wearing outfits
like these...

1132
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:50,880
and standing in front of those
backdrops, it just doesn't work.

1133
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:55,400
I fear that this will be
the end of opera as we know it.

1134
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:57,600
What do all of you think?

1135
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:05,080
Are you saying that modern operas
aren't Beijing Operas?

1136
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:08,840
What is Beijing Opera after all?
You can put it succinctly.

1137
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:12,200
'' No sound is but a song,
no movement is but a dance.''

1138
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:14,200
It must have beauty.

1139
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:15,720
For instance--

1140
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:19,360
Teacher, I don't get it.

1141
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:25,600
Practice. When you've sweated
enough to fill buckets, you'll get it.

1142
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:26,960
I still don't understand.

1143
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,760
Xiao Si!

1144
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:30,600
I just don't get it.

1145
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:35,200
Why is it Beijing Opera when ancient
heroes and beauties take the stage...

1146
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,400
but not when
the laboring masses do?

1147
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:39,720
You're talking apples
and oranges. Upstart!

1148
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:42,480
What kind of attitude is that?

1149
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:46,720
I'd like to hear
from Teacher Duan.

1150
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:48,520
Xiaolou!

1151
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:58,680
It's going to rain.
I've brought your umbrella.

1152
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:01,200
Catch!

1153
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:11,920
Yes, yes, run along home now.

1154
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:30,720
Theoretical questions
give me a headache.

1155
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:36,600
I say if it uses the traditional forms,
then it's Beijing Opera.

1156
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,760
Am I right?

1157
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:43,600
I'd like to say something.

1158
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:51,080
I've been part of the New Society
since giving my theater to the state.

1159
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:55,760
Comrade Cheng,
I believe you're wrong.

1160
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:03,040
Modern opera is a new venture.
It deserves our support.

1161
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:13,120
If opera relied on being a smart-ass,
you'd graduate with honors.

1162
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:17,360
Opera requires practice,
skill and talent.

1163
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:19,920
There are no shortcuts!

1164
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:22,240
By forcing me to kneel,
you're breaking the law.

1165
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:26,360
And if I don't punish you,
you'll always be third-rate.

1166
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:28,840
You want to be a great actor?
Dream on!

1167
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:35,640
And when did you ever
seriously want me to succeed?

1168
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:39,200
All you've ever wanted
was a coolie, a stagehand...

1169
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:41,240
a follower, a bit player!

1170
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:46,960
How dare you! You're speaking
absolute rubbish!

1171
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:53,880
Kneel down!

1172
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:00,000
You won't live to see the day!

1173
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:12,120
Xiao Si!

1174
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:27,240
Go, then!
Be a bit player your whole life!

1175
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:33,960
Mister Cheng...

1176
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:37,600
I can hardly believe this.

1177
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:45,280
It's like something
out of the Old Society!

1178
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:52,200
If I continue to get bit parts,
I'll be unworthy of your patronage.

1179
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:39,000
So, you know?

1180
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:44,760
Uh, I just learned myself.

1181
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:48,000
That's not true, Teacher Duan.

1182
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:51,440
You were there
at the meeting last night.

1183
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:59,240
Xiao Si! You said you'd notify Dieyi
that you were replacing him.

1184
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:03,840
I had second thoughts.
I decided you should tell him.

1185
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:05,920
Don't you agree?

1186
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:10,160
If you couldn't tell him,
who could?

1187
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:16,760
Take it off!.

1188
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:17,920
Take it off!.

1189
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:20,040
Don't. Don't be like that!

1190
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,440
I won't fucking sing anymore!

1191
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:25,120
Let whoever wants to perform
do so.

1192
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,080
Xiaolou, you mustn't go.

1193
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:36,720
Comrade Duan...

1194
02:13:42,080 --> 02:13:44,960
that audience is made up
of the laboring masses.

1195
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:49,960
You decide whether you'll sing
for them or not.

1196
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:09,800
Xiaolou, the concubine is on stage.
You'd better hurry.

1197
02:14:12,120 --> 02:14:15,000
Xiaolou... Mister Duan!

1198
02:14:16,040 --> 02:14:19,880
I've followed my king

1199
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:24,200
On his military campaigns

1200
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:41,840
Enduring the wind and frost

1201
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:48,760
And hard toil year after year

1202
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:58,800
I hate only the lawless tyrant

1203
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:04,480
Who has plunged our people

1204
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:10,440
Into an abyss of misery

1205
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:34,960
The people have suffered

1206
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:40,840
Untold hardship and pain

1207
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:46,960
The king has returned to camp!

1208
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:50,600
I'm here.

1209
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:03,920
Your Highness.

1210
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:17,000
I've caused you so much grief.

1211
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:23,800
Thank you very much,
Miss Juxian.

1212
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:38,360
Dieyi!

1213
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:41,920
Dieyi, open the door! Open up!

1214
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:44,520
Dieyi!

1215
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:51,600
Won't you accept my apology?

1216
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:01,000
That little snake you rescued...

1217
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:04,440
has turned into
a veritable dragon!

1218
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:09,640
You have to go along with it!
What else can you do?

1219
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:15,560
No matter what, as you told me,
you have to keep on singing!

1220
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:16,920
Come on out...

1221
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,680
and see what's playing in
the theater of life these days.

1222
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:28,440
Douzi, listen
to your stage brother.

1223
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:32,840
Go with the times! I'll still be
the king and you my concubine!

1224
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:36,200
Why does the concubine
have to die?

1225
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:46,360
Dieyi, why are you
so impossible?

1226
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:51,240
That's the play,
for heaven's sake!

1227
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:04,240
1966 THE EVE OF
THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION

1228
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:10,680
Central People's Radio
will now broadcast...

1229
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:14,120
the decision of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee...

1230
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:18,520
regarding the Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution...

1231
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:22,360
passed on August 8, 1966.

1232
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:27,840
This new stage
in socialist revolution...

1233
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:33,120
is an event that will touch...

1234
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:36,280
the very soul of the People!

1235
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,720
A good Communist
must be brave...

1236
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:57,760
speak righteously
and fight for the revolution.

1237
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:00,240
The greatest virtue
for a revolutionary soldier...

1238
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:04,840
is to overthrow
the reactionary powers.

1239
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:08,600
This is the foundation
of our revolutionary struggle.

1240
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:12,120
If a soldier does not do this,
he is not a true revolutionary.

1241
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:19,720
Those who oppose
the revolution...

1242
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,960
will be sent to reform school
to adjust their attitudes.

1243
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:30,920
There they will find their
anti revolutionary stance will diminish.

1244
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:34,680
There are those who repeatedly
complain...

1245
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:37,080
that revolution
is not appropriate...

1246
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:39,360
that it's too violent...

1247
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:42,040
that it's too aggressive...

1248
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,440
that it's too abrupt
for the people.

1249
02:20:46,840 --> 02:20:48,480
All of that is ridiculous.

1250
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:51,560
How can you drink
at a time like this?

1251
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:54,800
I feel like it.

1252
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:03,080
Anyway, jade cups were part
of the ''Old Society.''

1253
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:08,640
We can't keep them, so we might
as well use them one last time.

1254
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:30,480
Come on!

1255
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:14,880
It still won't break!

1256
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:06,400
I'm so afraid!

1257
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:14,920
I dreamed I was on top of a tall
building alone amongst the clouds.

1258
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:20,480
I wanted to jump.

1259
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:23,840
Jump! I'd catch you.

1260
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:29,680
You weren't there.

1261
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:39,560
Xiaolou, you wouldn't leave me,
would you?

1262
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:43,840
Where did this sword come from?

1263
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:48,440
Cheng Dieyi gave it to me.

1264
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:51,880
How many times
did he give it to you?

1265
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:53,240
Twice.

1266
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:56,120
When was the second time?

1267
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:59,280
Shortly before
the liberation of Beijing.

1268
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:00,800
Where?

1269
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:04,560
On... on the street
in front of the theater.

1270
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:07,440
What did you say to each other?

1271
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:13,640
It was quite chaotic.
I don't remember.

1272
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:16,720
Think about it.

1273
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:19,720
We didn't say anything!

1274
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:21,520
Keep thinking.

1275
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:24,480
If we did, I can't recall.

1276
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:28,600
Something about what you'd do
to the Communists?

1277
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:34,080
No! Certainly not!

1278
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:36,560
I'd stake my life on it.

1279
02:25:37,720 --> 02:25:40,120
But what if we've got a witness?

1280
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:43,760
Who? Bring out the bastard!

1281
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:54,600
Na Kun!

1282
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,120
What did I say?

1283
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:00,840
I'll give you a hint.

1284
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:04,680
Something about ragtag troops.

1285
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:11,280
Na Kun! This is pure slander!

1286
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:15,320
You reactionary old theater boss!
You only want to protect yourself!.

1287
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:17,920
You said you'd take on
their ragtag troops.

1288
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,920
No! I never said that!

1289
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:25,280
What I meant was--

1290
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:27,320
What I said was--

1291
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:29,320
No, I said nothing at all!

1292
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:33,720
Mr. Na, help me. Mr. Na!

1293
02:26:37,880 --> 02:26:39,680
Duan Xiaolou...

1294
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:42,640
you've been smashing bricks
since you were a boy, haven't you?

1295
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:45,840
Do one for us.

1296
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:49,160
Do it!

1297
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:53,800
Come on!

1298
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:22,760
Duan Xiaolou,
aren't you the '' King''?

1299
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:27,080
No, I'm not.

1300
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:29,760
But you've always been
the '' King,'' haven't you?

1301
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:33,880
That's just an opera.

1302
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,320
It's not real life.

1303
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:40,960
Did you go to brothels
in the Old Society?

1304
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:44,040
Yes.

1305
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:46,800
Don't you think that's shameful?

1306
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:50,640
Yes.

1307
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:54,200
When you married Juxian,
what was she?

1308
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:58,240
A prostitute.

1309
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:02,240
Good.

1310
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:06,080
Now tell us what we need to know
about Cheng Dieyi.

1311
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:09,360
Of course, you don't have
to tell us anything.

1312
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:12,800
You saw what happened
to Yuan Shiqing.

1313
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:16,280
Make your own decision.

1314
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:20,400
Sweep away all Cow Demons
and Snake Spirits!

1315
02:28:20,480 --> 02:28:23,920
If the enemy doesn't surrender,
we will destroy him!

1316
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:30,080
Uncover the Black Gangs!
Cut off the Black Hands!

1317
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:36,600
Seize the Black Hands that have
infiltrated the cultural world!

1318
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:42,920
Revolution is no crime.
Rebellion is justified!

1319
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,960
Sweep away all Cow Demons
and Snake Spirits!

1320
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:18,400
Xiaolou!

1321
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:47,480
Duan Xiaolou
is the reactionary king!

1322
02:29:47,560 --> 02:29:49,200
Duan Xiaolou
isn't telling the truth!

1323
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:51,600
Duan Xiaolou and Cheng Dieyi
are anti-Party elements!

1324
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:54,560
Down with Duan Xiaolou!
Down with Cheng Dieyi!

1325
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:58,800
Talk! Talk!

1326
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:05,320
Obliterate all class enemies!

1327
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:11,720
Talk!

1328
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:13,560
All right, I'll tell you.

1329
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:18,840
He's totally mad about opera.
He's obsessed!

1330
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:20,560
Who? Make yourself clear.

1331
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:23,640
Come on!

1332
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,720
Cheng Dieyi!

1333
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:28,040
All he cares about is opera.

1334
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:32,640
No matter who was in the audience,
which class they belonged to...

1335
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:35,240
he'd still give it his all.

1336
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:38,760
Stop avoiding the real issues.

1337
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,680
You're not being straight
with us!

1338
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:47,600
If you don't give in,
we will annihilate you.

1339
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:54,800
At the start
of the War of Resistance...

1340
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:59,000
he sang for the Japanese.

1341
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:07,720
He was a... a... a traitor!

1342
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:09,640
Down with Cheng Dieyi!

1343
02:31:11,960 --> 02:31:13,120
Down with Cheng Dieyi!

1344
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:15,320
He sang for wounded
Nationalist soldiers...

1345
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:17,320
for reactionary theater bosses.

1346
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:19,440
He sang for capitalists,
landlords, the idle rich...

1347
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:20,600
their wives and daughters.

1348
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:23,360
He sang for hooligans,
for soldiers and policemen.

1349
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:26,040
He sang for the tyrant
of the opera world, Yuan Shiqing!

1350
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:29,040
Down with Cheng Dieyi!

1351
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:30,640
What else? Tell us.

1352
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:32,560
Talk!

1353
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:36,040
He smoked opium
like there was no tomorrow.

1354
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:40,840
He smoked away the blood and sweat
of the laboring masses.

1355
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:43,240
Keep going. Get to the point.

1356
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:44,280
Speak!

1357
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:46,280
Go on!

1358
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:48,600
Down with Cheng Dieyi!

1359
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:51,360
Talk!

1360
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:52,800
Xiaolou!

1361
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:56,160
Talk!

1362
02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:10,760
In order to get
on Yuan Shiqing's good side--

1363
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:16,680
He-Did you or did you not?

1364
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,880
He became Yuan Shiqing's-his--

1365
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:22,920
Xiaolou!

1366
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:24,840
Didn't you? Didn't you?

1367
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:27,920
You were-were-his--

1368
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:34,920
Sweep away all Cow Demons
and Snake Spirits!

1369
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:41,720
Scholars and beauties,
kings and ministers.

1370
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:47,080
Cow Demons and Snake Spirits.

1371
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:06,280
You've all betrayed me!

1372
02:33:09,240 --> 02:33:11,360
Betrayed me!

1373
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:19,240
I've got something
to unmask as well!

1374
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:23,520
I want to unmask the ugliness
behind the glamorous facade.

1375
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:29,560
Xiaolou, you've no conscience.

1376
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:32,080
You are as greedy as a wolf,
as cruel as a wild dog.

1377
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,840
You're a shell of a man.

1378
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:37,720
From the moment you got involved
with this woman...

1379
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:39,840
I knew you were finished.

1380
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:41,760
Everything was finished.

1381
02:33:43,400 --> 02:33:47,320
You think disaster just falls
from the sky?

1382
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:49,520
No.

1383
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:55,360
We have come step by step
towards this fate.

1384
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:57,280
It's retribution.

1385
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:01,880
I'm despicable, and I have been so
for a long time.

1386
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:06,200
But now even the King of Chu
is on his knees begging for mercy!

1387
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:08,800
Can Beijing Opera survive
this indignity?

1388
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:11,000
It's doomed, is it not?

1389
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:15,040
This is what's called
retribution!

1390
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:17,640
Karmic retribution!

1391
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:21,560
And I have something else
to unmask.

1392
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:23,280
See that woman?

1393
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:28,360
Who is she? I'll tell you.

1394
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:33,160
Slut!

1395
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:37,000
Top whore at the House of Blossoms!
Pan Jinlian!

1396
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:40,640
Fight against her!

1397
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:45,720
Fight against her to the death!

1398
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:56,360
Duan Xiaolou, is it true
she was a prostitute?

1399
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:58,480
Well, was she?

1400
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:00,680
Tell us!

1401
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:03,760
Yes.

1402
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:06,160
Do you love her?

1403
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:10,000
Do you?

1404
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:15,560
No.

1405
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:19,880
No, I don't love her!

1406
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:22,360
Is this the truth?

1407
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:24,840
Really! I really don't love her.

1408
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:27,240
I'll never have anything to do
with her again.

1409
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:32,800
Nothing at all.

1410
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:37,880
Leniency to those who confess,
severity to those who resist!

1411
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:41,360
Obliterate all class enemies!

1412
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:20,320
Juxian! Juxian!

1413
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:42,280
Listen to Grandma
talk of revolution

1414
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:48,520
a tale of heroism and tragedy

1415
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:54,280
I was a child
of the rain and wind

1416
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:47,520
''THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
IS A POWERFUL WEAPON...

1417
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:50,360
IN THE HANDS OF
THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS.''

1418
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:08,200
1977
ELEVEN YEARS LATER

1419
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:10,920
My king, quickly give me
your precious sword.

1420
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:18,760
No, you mustn't take your life!

1421
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:25,200
My king, quickly give me
your precious sword.

1422
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:27,400
No, you must not do this!

1423
02:39:34,800 --> 02:39:37,280
It's no good.

1424
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:42,280
I'm old. I can't do it anymore.

1425
02:39:55,880 --> 02:39:58,760
At sixteen I am a nun.

1426
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:08,520
My hair shorn at youth's prime.

1427
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:10,360
I am by nature a boy.

1428
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:11,800
Not a girl.

1429
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:14,000
Wrong! You've done it again!

1430
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:27,160
I am by nature a boy...

1431
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:31,360
not a girl.

1432
02:40:35,680 --> 02:40:38,840
Come on, let's try it again.

1433
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:44,800
My king, quickly give me
your precious sword.

1434
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:52,560
No, you mustn't take your life!

1435
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:59,000
My king, quickly give me
your precious sword.

1436
02:40:59,080 --> 02:41:01,200
No, you must not do this!

1437
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:04,720
Give me your sword.

1438
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:07,720
No, never!

1439
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:13,480
My king, the soldiers of Han...
they've entered the city!

1440
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:15,680
Where?

1441
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:46,920
Dieyi!

1442
02:41:53,840 --> 02:41:56,040
Douzi?
