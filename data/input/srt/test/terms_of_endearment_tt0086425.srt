00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,921
No, thank you.

339
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,091
What are you afraid of?

340
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,656
Afraid?

341
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,259
Well,

342
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,096
why not--

343
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,143
Why not come on in?

344
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,510
Because you're much older
than the boys I date,

345
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,708
'cause you're drunk,

346
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,275
and because when I went
to see an astronaut...

347
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,843
give a lecture,

348
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:33,015
I didn't expect him
to prowl after us.

349
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,787
I didn't expect some silly flirt...

350
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,795
to keep his jacket open...

351
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,297
because his belly's
getting too big.

352
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,730
I expected a hero.

353
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:01,609
Well, okay, Doris, don't come in.

354
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,054
I don't want you in my house.

355
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,854
Lee Anne, would you like
to come in?

356
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,259
You better tend to that cut.

357
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,813
Tommy, show me your belly.

358
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,314
Come on.

359
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,819
How can you dress him like that?

360
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,320
He's adorable.
Look at him.

361
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,982
Oh.

362
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,828
Oh, great, Tommy.

363
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,331
Uh-oh.

364
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,833
[ Telephone Rings ]

365
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,165
That's Vernon.
So tell I'm, uh--

366
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,169
Out?

367
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,500
[ Ring ]

368
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,336
No. Tell him I'm resting.

369
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,171
Hello.

370
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,608
Hi, Flap.

371
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,745
Where?

372
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,306
No. Tell me now.
I want to know now.

373
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,759
Oh, Flap, you didn't
expect I'd be happy.

374
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,590
Let's be honest
with each other...

375
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,994
before we start pretending.

376
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,768
Um, look, Mom's
staring at me right now,

377
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:29,864
so can I talk about it
later to you?

378
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,873
Yeah.

379
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,773
All right.

380
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:33,776
Bye.

381
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,293
How long are you going
to keep this a secret?

382
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:53,297
The only school accepting Flap
for his associate professorship...

383
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,799
is in Des Moines.

384
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,301
He can't even do
the simple things,

385
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,860
Iike fail locally.

386
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,741
It's going to be fine, Momma.

387
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,243
It's Des Moines.

388
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,746
Say, "Bye-bye, house."

389
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,146
Bye-bye, house.

390
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,257
Be careful going down
these steps.

391
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,758
Don't break your leg.

392

Come here.
Come here.

00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,271
Come here.
Come here.

[ Rosie ]
Stay sweet, honey.

395
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,172
Rosie--

396
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,307
Uh, that's enough, Rosie.

397
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,782
They have to get started.

398
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:50,288
Tell Momma to drive you home
when you work late.

399
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,652
Have some fun, Rosie.

400
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,156
Don't act so brave.

401
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,285
I know you'll go crazy
without me to nag.

402
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,228
You be good to her
or else we'll get you.

403
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,192
I mean it.

404
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,868
Bye, Flap.

405
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,067
Have a good drive.

406
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,247
Okay, fingers and toes in.

407
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,748
Take Momma's purse.

408
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,756
Momma, that's the first time...

409
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,594
I stopped hugging first.

410
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,691
I like that.

411
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,895
Get yourself
a decent maternity dress.

412
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,805
Had to get one in, didn't you?

413
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,077
Did you tell her, Patsy?

414
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,477
She keeps thinking it's me.

415
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,782
Tom,

416
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,786
will you be good
to your mother...

417
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,084
and take care of her?

418
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,623
Bye, Mrs. Greenway.

419
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,215
Good-bye.

Write when you get there,
so I'll have your address.

Write when you get there,
so I'll have your address.

You shape up, Patsy.

00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,191
Oops!

00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,700
Dropped my gum.

We'll get you another piece.

The phone bill will be
enormous, you know that?

427
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,717
I'll miss you, Momma.

428
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,724
Can we go now?

429
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,726
Yeah. Pull away slow.

to be away from your--

00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,359
From our families.

433
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,868
I miss Houston.

434
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:22,373
You don't know
how lucky you are.

435

Everybody wants to go
to Des Moines.

436
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,746
People come to get
one look at Des Moines...

437
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,246
before they die.

438
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:34,752
Some people say
it's the best city in Iowa.

439
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,753
I know you're teasing me.

440
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,755
Texas is the best!

441
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,722
I think you should stop worrying.

442
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,228
You'll see some
terrific new things.

443

Would you please, if you will,

449
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:12,723
hold it down over there?

450
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,521
Sorry, I can't hear you.

Hold it down!

Have some respect
for other people's feelings!

Hey, you in the bush,
I can't hear you.

455
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,721
I took a sauna.

456
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,383
It's hard not to yell...

when you hit cold water.

458
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,725
You're ignoring me
when I speak?

459
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,732
What am I supposed to say?

460
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,234
It's hard not to yell...

461
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,567
when you hit cold water.

462
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,833
Hey, uh, come here.

463
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,510
Come here?

464
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,911
What is your name?

465
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:11,914
Aurora?

466
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:12,915
Yes.

467
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,777
You-You want a shock?

468
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,016
No, not especially.

469
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,079
What?

470
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:27,698
Well, we're going to have this...

471
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,199
dinner at, uh--

472
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,202
NASA dinner at the White House.

473
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,707
You know, some cosmonauts,
and all of us--

474
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,243
I didn't know
who I could take.

475
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,245
All the people I flew with,

476
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:46,249
their wives are giving me
bitch bites all over my back...

477
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,252
if I show up
with one of my regular girls.

478
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,311
I didn't know
anybody old enough,

479
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:56,520
so I thought, "Well, I'll ask
my next-door neighbor."

480
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,232
Well, anyway, they
canceled the dinner,

481
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,669
but I was really thinking
about asking you out.

482
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,830
Seriously.

483
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,568
Ain't that a shocker?

484
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,075
Yes.

485
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,579
Imagine you having a date
with someone...

486
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,514
where it wasn't necessarily
a felony.

487
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,790
What would you have said
if I asked you?

488
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,792
Seriously.

489
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,454
I would've said I'd like
to see the White House.

490
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,001
So you would've come.

491
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,269
What the hell.

492
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,308
You want to have dinner
out sometime?

493
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,808
No, thank you.

494
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,538
What about lunch?

495
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:51,275
You ladies, you like
to have lunch a lot.

496
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,318
There's something
about your manner.

497
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:59,914
It's like you're trying
to toy with me.

498
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,256
That's right, Aurora.
I'm playing with you.

499
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,762
This is the element.

500
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,264
Do you want to play, Aurora?

501
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,631
Want to have lunch?

502
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,068
We'll have lunch.

503
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,274
If you want to have lunch
in some restaurant...

504
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,277
to improve the atmosphere
in this neighborhood,

505
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,074
I wouldn't exactly say no.

506
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,273
Come here.

507
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,285
We're too far apart to talk.

508
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,126
Now,

509
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,291
Aurora,

510
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,299
since you've agreed,

511
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:51,308
why don't we just
forget about the rest?

512
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,812
I mean, I know how you feel.

513
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,815
There were countdowns
when I had my doubts.

514
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,748
I said to myself,

515
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,252
"You agreed to do it.

516
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,913
"You're strapped in,

517
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,423
"and you're in the hands...

518
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:12,054
"of something bigger and
more powerful than yourself.

519
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,066
"So, uh, why don't you just...

520
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:20,093
Iay back and enjoy the ride??"

521
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,604
I'm not going.

522
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,607
There's something
wrong with you.

523
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,280
Oh, God.
I'm such a shit.

524

[ Flap ]
Wait! That must be it.

525

[ Emma ]
Right there? Oh, God!

526
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,795
Flap, it's great.
Is that it, really?

527
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,295
Oh, it's great.

528
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,695
Isn't that sweet?

529
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,801
Oh, that was a bump.

530
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,302
Oh, yeah.

531
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,805
What is that?

532
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:58,307
Shall we go see the house?

533
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,741
You stay there.

534
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,280
Come on.
Let's get this off.

535
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,248
Come on.

536
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,251
Whoa! Come on.

537
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,756
Oh, sweetheart,
did you hurt yourself?

538
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,757
Nope, not yet.

539
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,760
Do you like it?

540
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,262
Do you like it?

541
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,264
Oh, it's great.

542
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,266
Flap, it's great.

543
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,767
Oh, my God.

Oh.

Oh!

546
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,518
Leave the mattress here.
We can sleep here.

547
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,291
I'm really tired.

548
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,404
Ow! Ow!

You ever made love in Iowa?

550
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,257
Tommy's room is on
the other side of the hall,

551
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,258
so we can get noisy.

552
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:26,262
Good. You get to make
your little high-pitched squeak.

553

Oh! Oh! Oh!

555
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,103
What about you?

556
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,604
Here I come.

00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,435
Here I come again.

00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,270
Yes! Yes!

559
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,775
Yes!

Oh, God.

565
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,458
You just made me wet.

566
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,893
How can you do that
with your voice?

567
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,727
You just make
your voice like that.

568
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,233
If Tommy can't hear us,

569
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,236
we can't hear Tommy.

570
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,899
He's fine, Mother.

00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,910
Don't get pissy.

This isn't love, it's selfishness.

It's been a week
since we've been together.

585
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,284
We've never gone a week.

586
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,786
Sure, we have.

587
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,186
Only in the real pregnant months.

Don't make me feel silly,

591
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,061
I won't make you feel guilty.

592
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,566
Fair enough.

593
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,398

Hi, Mother.

Stop right here.
Tell me what it is.

Okay, Mother.
I need some money.

I need you

I really need it, so will you?

Oh, Mother, please don't be quiet.

You know that was hard for me.

You can say no,
but please don't be quiet.

Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

625
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,369
I was just thinking.

00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,837
Thinking what?

627
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:32,501
How much I hate
to part with money.

628
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,010
I wouldn't have asked if--

629
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,137
Don't yell,

630
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,011
but I think that
I may be pregnant again.

Oh! No!

Then they get wonderful jobs.

You can have it in Colorado.

No! That's your security.

using that for rent.

I'll talk to you later, all right?

655
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:49,513
All right.
If the money would mean--

656
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,385
No, don't. It would
make you crazy.

657
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:54,956
Yes, it would.

I'm not doing anything.

00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,758
Oh, yes, you are.

Don't change the subject.

What's the subject?

677
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,768
That I'm on to you.

678
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,278
You wouldn't look so innocent...

679
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,280
unless you were guilty.

680
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:27,283
You'll have to
take my word for it.

681
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,615
You have no other choice.

682
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:33,123
No, no, no.
No, no, no!

683
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,623
Whoa!

684
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,295
Excuse me.

685
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:46,636
Emma, you always
get a little paranoid...

686
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,639
in your first few months, okay?

687
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,969
Just--

688
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,313
If you are doing something...

689
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,440
and trying to make me
feel crazy because I'm pregnant,

690
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,486
you may have sunk so low...

691
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,986
you'll never recover.

692
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,488
You may have just panicked,

693
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,991
and trying to save yourself,

694
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,493
you've thrown out
your character and principles.

695
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,998
The only way you could
redeem yourself...

696
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,999
is to admit anything...

697
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:21,026
that you might have
been doing last night.

698
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,073
If you don't do that,

699
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,608
you are a lost man.

You've got to tell me.

Hello, Aurora.

How are you?

Yes, she's--

What about the baby?

00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,747
It's a great day
when you get tenure!

713
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,248
All tenure means...

714
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:09,753
is we won't have
enough money forever!

715
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,755
Why won't you ask your mother?

716
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,757
At your convenience, right?

717
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,258
Go ahead! Call her!

Why don't you call?

Yeah, I'll call Aurora, right?

Mommy said to wait right here.

What are you guys doing here?

Answer me, Tommy.

to think we lived there.

I could have something.

Oh, of course.
I remember who you are.

00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,476
Can I help you
make up the difference?

774
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,416
Thanks. I'd appreciate it.

775
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,681
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

776
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,024
You're a very rude young woman.

777
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,754
I know Douglas from the Rotary.

778
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:41,423
I can't believe he'd want you
treating customers so badly.

779
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:44,365
I don't think I was
treating her badly.

780
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:47,267
Then you must be from New York.

781
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,444
Be careful, Teddy!

782
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:56,444
What?

783
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:57,946
Be careful!

784
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,213
Where's your car?

785
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,218
Right here.

786
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,721
That was worst time I've ever had.

787
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,724
I didn't know I could get
cheered up so fast.

788
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:09,724
No problem.

789
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,226
Come on, Mom.

790
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,728
Wait by the car.

791
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:13,728
Come on.

792
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:14,729
Wait.

793
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:15,730
No.

794
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,630
Wait by the car, honey.

795
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,633
But--

796
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:19,634
Wait, honey!

797
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,728
Over by the car!

798
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:22,737
Now!

799
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,738
Now!

800
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,468
Now!

801
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,739
Nice boys.

802
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,249
You're great with them, too.

803
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,252
Really.

804
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,416
I think all three of us
are going through a stage.

805
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,923
Hey, thanks again.

806
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,755
Oh, no thanks required.

807
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,795
I've had a lovely time.

808
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,993
Me, too.
I'll get the money back to you.

809
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,127
You can drop it
in the mail, if you like.

810
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,467
To the bank?

811
00:47:55,539 --> 00:48:00,499
Sure. You could even use
a check-by-mail envelope.

812
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:04,104
Or, uh, you could come in.
Whichever.

813
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,809
Maybe I'll come in sometime.

814
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,713
Well, that'd be fine.

815
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,226
Can I help you with that?

816
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,892
No, thanks.
I'm used to this.

817
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,731
And so another birthday...

Even though 50,

820
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,368
she still takes my breath away.

821
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:39,211
Mere mortals just gaze
as she lights up their sky.

822
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,878
A heavenly object, a siren's cry.

823
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,554
You're the best.

824
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:47,055
Happy birthday.

825
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,392
Thank you, Edward.

Thank you.

Do you want one, Vernon?

828
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,734
Would you like a kiss?

829
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:04,840
You're not lying
about your age, are you?

830
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,341
Of course not.

831
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,844
I thought you were 52.

832
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:13,315
How do you expect
to fool a family doctor?

833
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,351
She said her age.

834
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,353
The number doesn't matter,

835
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,355
but its concealment does.

836
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,357
Why does he keep talking?

The way to adjust to old age--

839
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:29,365

Hi.

00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:57,081
I was curious if you still
wanted to take me to lunch.

I wasn't aware that we--

could you possibly put the top up?

That's what I was thinking

01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,932
or I lose 20 pounds.

1175
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,433
Whichever comes first.

1176
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,336
I don't know.

1177
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,430
About 20 minutes, I guess.

1178
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,777
I've been offered a job.

1179
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,280
What?

1180
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,748
Why didn't you say something?

1181
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:12,617
I wanted to think about it.

1182
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,623
It's head of the
English Department...

1183
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,556
at Kearney State College--

1184
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,560
For the same money.

1185
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,863
Where is it?

1186
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,330
Nebraska.

1187
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:31,738
I don't want to move.

1188
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:33,798
I love the school,

1189
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:35,366
the pediatricians--

1190
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,344
Head of the department.

1191
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,712
We'll talk about it, all right?

1192
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:43,217
I like it here, Flap.

1193
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,219
Head of the department.

1194
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,720
That's-- That's great.

1195
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,628
Good-bye, Mom.

1196
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,129
Come on, Teddy.

1197
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:58,132
Don't kiss the baby.

1198
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,633
She may still be sick.

1199
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:02,636
Have a good day at school.

1200
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,478
What a night!

1201
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,482
Melanie decided
to get the croup,

1202
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,485
and I haven't gotten any sleep.

1203
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:19,418
He may be kidding,

1204
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:22,423
but Flap says he's taking us...

1205
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,925
to some college in Nebraska.

1206
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:29,862
I think Sam is becoming
someone that I need.

1207
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:33,368
I'm lying here
next to the astronaut.

1208
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,426
Are you really?

1209
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,872
How was it?

1210
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:41,375
I'll speak to you later.

1211
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:44,378
I feel so good for you.

1212
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:45,879
Call me soon.

1213
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:47,381
Bye.

1214
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,882
Bye.

1215
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,543
Mel?

1216
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,287
Okay, Mel.

1217
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:02,730
[ Garrett ] I just want
to make this clear, you know.

1218
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:04,732
I see other women.

1219
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,236
I didn't exactly think
we were engaged.

1220
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:10,134
Your ego. Really!

1221
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:12,639
Okay. Let's stay in tonight.

1222
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:15,643
You're saving a fortune on me.

1223
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:16,643
I'll cook.

1224
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,407
It's been three weeks,

1225
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,914
and you haven't
even seen my house.

1226
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:24,077
My best instincts
had me avoiding it.

1227
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,725
What are you thinking?

1228
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,260
Oh,

1229
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:43,771
I'll tell you what.

1230
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:48,775
I think this is really sad...

1231
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:52,780
that you need this stuff
to impress girls.

1232
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,281
Need it?

1233
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:55,782
Mm-hmm.

1234
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,785
Sometimes it isn't enough.

1235
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:01,289
There's nothing wrong
with using your assets.

1236
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:05,122
I think it turns your profession
into a sex trap.

1237
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:07,627
Everybody uses
whatever they have.

1238
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,129
I earned it!

1239
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:13,190
There's 106 astronauts
in the whole fucking world,

1240
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,634
and I'm one of them!

1241
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,638
It's part of me.

1242
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:20,539
Sorry. I didn't
mean to trip...

1243
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,544
on such a deeply felt principle.

1244
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:42,330
Do you want to know
what bothers me?

1245
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:46,834
None of us ever
got together in one room,

1246
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,836
Iocked all the doors,

1247
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,839
and compared notes
on the experience.

1248
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:55,343
I think we had to pretend...

1249
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,345
it wasn't the fun that it was.

1250
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,350
You do sense the speed.

1251
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:08,355
I remember looking out
the window of the spacecraft--

1252
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:12,359
I sound like somebody
with a big belly...

1253
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:14,861
telling their stories about Korea.

1254
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,797
Anyway, I'm looking
out the window.

1255
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:21,302
I see a piece of the spacecraft,

1256
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:24,305
and it's whistling
along the ground.

1257
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,807
It doesn't make a sound.

1258
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,309
The only sound you hear,

1259
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:32,814
the only noise
in the entire world,

1260
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,815
is your heart beating.

1261
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,324
It's indescribable.

1262
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:47,829
Anyway, I can't think
of a better way of saying it.

1263
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,830
That was my moment,

1264
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:52,833
the one that doesn't go away.

1265
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,335
You know what I mean?

1266
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:56,837
Yes.

1267
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,842
Hey--

1268
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:04,344
This is my moment.

1269
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,354
No, don't get nervous.

1270
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,301
Flap?

1271
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:33,799
Anybody?

1272
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:57,498
[ Girl ] You don't think it's love
because we're having fun.

1273
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:58,999
Love can be fun.

1274
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,501
Would you stop making faces?

1275
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,973
That's wonderful.

1276
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:11,741
[ Flap ] What we have here is
a typical grad-school girl crush.

1277
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:15,340
Would you please stop
telling me this is a crush?

1278
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,784
The fun with getting
involved with someone...

1279
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,788
unavailable and slightly older...

1280
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:24,292
is that sometimes you hear
what's really going on.

1281
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:25,792
[ Girl ]
Flap, you are such an--

1282
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:27,795
...incredible asshole!

1283
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:31,696
Excuse me.

1284
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:43,310
Emma!

1285
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,312
God damn it, Emma,
you'll ruin us!

1286
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:50,976
You're a spectacle!

1287
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,485
I am not!

1288
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,323
Stop jiggling her.

1289
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:57,824
She'll throw up.

1290
01:19:57,893 --> 01:19:59,827
Your timing was perfect.

1291
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:03,331
You caught us
before we did anything.

1292
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:06,333
I'm taking the kids to Houston.

1293
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,335
Give me the baby.

1294
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,338
You don't know what I did,

1295
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:15,342
just like I don't know
what you do...

1296
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,344
on your afternoon drives.

1297
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,778
[ Boy In Crowd ]
Professor Horton, can we talk...

1298
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:21,281
about my grade?

1299
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:24,785
You ought to be
happy I'm going.

1300
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:29,881
If I stayed here,
I'd make life hell for you.

1301
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,289
Don't follow me.

1302
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:32,792
Excuse me.

1303
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,294
Excuse me.

1304
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:35,795
Excuse me!

1305
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:37,957
Excuse me!

1306
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,804
[ Horn Honks ]

1307
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:46,807
It's them. It's them!

1308
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,822
Garrett, come meet Emma.

1309
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,324
No, you don't need outsiders.

1310
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:05,825
You're no outsider!

1311
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,828
I'll see them later.

1312
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:09,830
Emma, this is Garrett.

1313
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,332
Oh! Pleasure to meet you.

1314
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,335
I've heard so much about you.

1315
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:18,497
Your mother's been
looking forward to this.

1316
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:19,904
So--

1317
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,442
Go ahead.

1318
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:26,336
Anything wrong, Garrett?

1319
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,075
No.

1320
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:30,617
Very nice to meet you.

1321
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:33,245
Must be nice to be home.

1322
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:36,313
Oh, it's great. It's great.

1323
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,359
I'll be over later.

1324
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:42,226
They're tired,
and will get to sleep early,

1325
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:46,324
and I'd like to get to bed early.

1326
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,834
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma!

1327
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,394
Bye-bye.

1328
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,667
[ Rosie ]
Come on out. All right.

1329
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,335
This one likes to squeeze.

1330
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,344
Teddy likes to squeeze,

1331
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:59,346
Tommy likes to squeeze.

1332
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,848
You both get a squeeze.

1333
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,350
The baby.

1334
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,851
Where's the baby?

1335
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,781
Oh, there is my baby.

1336
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:14,921
Look at the baby!

1337
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:18,796
I think she looks
a little like you.

1338
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:23,804
A little? She is like
looking in the mirror.

1339
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,806
She loved the ride.

1340
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:28,308
She hardly cried at all.

1341
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:32,312
Bring in the suitcases.

1342
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,813
Okay.

1343
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:34,814
Mom--

1344
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:37,647
I talk to you every day.

1345
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,321
Mother, you look great.

1346
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,822
You look terrible.

1347
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:47,828
Nobody wants a girl who's
washed-out and tired-looking.

1348
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:50,330
I just drove 1,000 miles.

1349
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:54,334
Besides, men love me
the way I am.

1350
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:58,839
You finally take one
small step away from Flap,

1351
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:02,343
it's with an unavailable,
older Iowan.

1352
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:07,347
Tell me about the astronaut.

1353
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,849
You going to sleep now,

1354
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:13,288
or are we going to talk?

1355
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:26,629
How's the astronaut, Mother?

1356
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:33,306
Really?

1357
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:35,975
Oh, really?

1358
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:42,315
He has a name, though.

1359
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:44,318
You really like him.

1360
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:45,318
Yeah.

1361
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:49,823
Well, it's just so--

1362
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:55,829
It's so strange that relatively--

1363
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:58,331
relatively late in life,

1364
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,836
I've found that sex is so--

1365
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:03,837
so--

1366
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:05,338
so--

1367
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,341
so--

1368
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:09,707
so fan-fucking-tastic!

1369
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:14,348
Anyway, that's what he calls it.

1370
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,302
A moth to flame.

1371
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:41,308
This affair is going to kill me.

1372
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:42,809
No. Maybe not.

1373
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:45,311
Why do you say that?

1374
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,814
Come on, Momma.

1375
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:51,818
I never thought
I'd start to need him.

1376
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:59,322
You're so lucky
you have a pool.

1377
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,835
Stand there.
Stand there!

1378
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:15,842
Okay.

1379
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:18,276
Let's talk about Los Angeles.

1380
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:20,109
Do you miss it?

1381
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:23,283
[ Telephone Rings ]

1382
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:27,287
It was interesting dating Jews
after the divorce.

1383
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:29,482
They are so lively.

1384
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:30,489
Really?

1385
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:31,923
Yeah.

1386
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:34,291
They were anxious
to make you feel...

1387
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:36,796
they understood
your secret thoughts...

1388
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,298
better than anybody.

1389
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:41,665
I was just glad I had some.

1390
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:44,967
Honey, there's
a telephone call for you.

1391
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:46,802
Hello.

1392
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:48,308
Oh, hi, Flap.

1393
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:50,310
How are you?

1394
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:52,312
I'm fine.

1395
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:58,546
I look older,
like everyone else.

1396
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,315
She does not.

1397
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:01,821
You sound the same.

1398
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,324
I'm not sure that's good.

1399
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:09,056
She's right here.

1400
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:13,829
No, we have other things
to talk about besides you.

1401
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:19,839
Hello?

1402
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:22,342
I'm fine.

1403
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,379
What's up?

1404
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:27,004
Feeling contrite?

1405
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:32,518
You don't seem to understand.

1406
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:34,521
I saw you together.

1407
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:35,920
What?

1408
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:41,528
I can't believe
you're doing this to us.

1409
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:46,032
Well, I think you're spiteful,

1410
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,866
and I don't know when
the hell that happened.

1411
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:53,096
No! Good-bye. I'll--

1412
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:54,698
Good-bye.

1413
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:07,554
Flap accepted the job
at Kearney, Nebraska.

1414
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:09,021
We're moving in a week.

1415
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,581
I don't know why
you don't leave him.

1416
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:14,184
Honestly, I don't know either.

1417
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:15,286
He's cute.

1418
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:38,976
I've been packing for us all week.

1419
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:49,520
Sure remembers her Daddy.

1420
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:54,962
So are you going to stay mad?

1421
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:57,004
Being uprooted without my consent...

1422
01:27:57,071 --> 01:27:59,904
is at least worth
a pout, don't you?

1423
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,144
Come on.

1424
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,549
Head of the department.

1425
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,050
I know.

1426
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,994
Aurora?

1427
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:21,995
Garrett, I'm back here.

1428
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:24,997
Well, hello, stranger.

1429
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:28,001
What's it been, about two days?

1430
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,505
Your family still around?

1431
01:28:32,573 --> 01:28:34,006
No, they left.

1432
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,513
What?

1433
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:58,532
You probably know
what I'm going to say.

1434
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:01,534
Oh, maybe not.

1435
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:03,035
I hope not.

1436
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:09,041
Well,

1437
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:13,045
you're some kind of woman,

1438
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:16,550
but I'm the wrong kind of man,

1439
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:21,452
and it seems my shot
at being the right kind...

1440
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:25,481
is as good as I was hoping for.

1441
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:31,364
You don't know how much
you'll miss me.

1442
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:35,061
I don't want to blow
smoke up your ass.

1443
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:37,001
Oh!

1444
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:39,972
What a relief.

1445
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:45,502
It's just that I'm starting
to feel an obligation here.

1446
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,514
It makes it rough,

1447
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:49,516
especially living next door.

1448
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:51,518
I'm starting to think...

1449
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,520
I got to watch
what I'm doing--

1450
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:57,524
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

1451
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:11,538
I am going to miss you...

1452
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:16,042
and I do feel bad.

1453
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:21,480
You're lucky.

1454
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:26,315
I feel humiliated.

1455
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:53,012
Can I have your picture?

1456
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,016
The one I have has Flap in it.

1457
01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:58,517
I don't mind.

1458
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,476
Come here and give me a kiss.

1459
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,811
I need this kind of type.

1460
01:31:57,879 --> 01:31:59,312
Fine. Hello, Emma.

1461
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,813
Hi, baby.

1462
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:05,319
She wanted her daddy
to see her dressed up.

1463
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:07,820
I'll talk to you later.

1464
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:13,326
Excuse me.

1465
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:23,929
Miss?

1466
01:32:24,005 --> 01:32:25,097
Miss?

1467
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:26,400
Miss!

1468
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:27,702
Miss!

1469
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:38,110
Don't make me run after you.

1470
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:40,278
I have a toddler here.

1471
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:08,047
Are you the reason that
we came to Nebraska?

1472
01:33:08,115 --> 01:33:11,448
I think that Flap
should talk to you.

1473
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,886
We discussed that.

1474
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:17,925
I don't want to say
anything until he does,

1475
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:21,428
except that I don't think
there's an emotion you're having...

1476
01:33:21,495 --> 01:33:22,928
that I couldn't...

1477
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:23,986
validate.

1478
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,705
Tell you what.

1479
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,206
If you see Flap,

1480
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:37,210
tell him his wife and baby...

1481
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:40,441
went to get
their flu shots, all right?

1482
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:47,820
[ Man ]
Just hold still.

1483
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:49,150
Ow!

1484
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:51,157
That's a good girl.

1485
01:33:51,225 --> 01:33:53,159
[ Emma ]
Okay? You're all finished.

1486
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:55,161
It's all over.

1487
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:59,165
If it makes you feel better,

1488
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:01,667
Mommy's getting a shot, too.

1489
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:04,170
Can she have a pop?

1490
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:05,170
Here.

1491
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:06,672
There you go.

1492
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:11,677
Will they tell me
if my husband calls?

1493
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:15,182
You have a lump in your armpit.

1494
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:17,479
How long has it been there?

1495
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:18,449
I don't know.

1496
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:20,419
Melanie, stop kicking the cabinet!

1497
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:23,423
There's two of them.
Not very big, though.

1498
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:27,951
I'm leaving town,
but you shouldn't wait.

1499
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:29,621
They should come out.

1500
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:32,791
Come out?
Should I be scared?

1501
01:34:32,867 --> 01:34:35,665
If you're scared,
you'll be happier...

1502
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:38,967
when it turns out
to be nothing.

1503

Dr. Budge,

01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:45,172
Mom should get
a pop, too, for her shot.

1505
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:46,679
Right. Here, Mom.

1506
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:48,180
Thanks, Mel.

1507
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:50,615
I know what it is.

1508
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,949
Your sweat glands are clogged.

1509
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,317
It's a cyst.

1510
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:56,356
So I shouldn't worry?

1511
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:59,621
It's a cyst, right where
your oil glands are.

1512
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:03,926
You've never eaten right,
or learned how to wash.

1513
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,431
You're right. Thanks.

1514
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:07,524
Talk to Melanie.

1515
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:10,627
Hello. I sent you a blouse.

1516
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,138
[ Emma ]
Say good-bye.

1517
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:13,138
[ Melanie ]
Bye.

1518
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,640
Okay. Say good--

1519
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:17,143
Say good-bye to your mother.

1520
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:27,078
What's her name?

1521
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:28,086
Janice.

1522
01:35:28,155 --> 01:35:30,589
What did the doctor say?

1523
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:35,595
It's scary that he wants
to do it so fast.

1524
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:38,097
Janice, with her little folder.

1525
01:35:38,165 --> 01:35:41,191
"I can't say
anything until he does.

1526
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:43,498
We've discussed it."

1527
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:44,595
Really, Flap!

1528
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:46,606
"Validate my feelings."

1529
01:35:46,674 --> 01:35:47,606
Your taste!

1530
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:50,838
But that thing
the doctor said--

1531
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:51,843
No!

1532
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:55,040
I won't make you feel better!

1533
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:56,105
Dinner!

1534
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:13,633
Dear, you have a--

1535
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:15,635
- Malignancy.
-...malignancy.

1536
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:23,142
Say it again.

1537
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,472
Malignancy.

1538
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:29,147
Rosie,

1539
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:32,651
our girl is in trouble.

1540
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,154
She has a cyst that's malignant.

1541
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:39,659
They're taking her to
a hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska.

1542
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:41,660
Oh,

1543
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,668
We'll release her soon.

1544
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:52,172
We do more on an outpatient basis.

1545
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:56,403
She shouldn't need to come back
unless it escalates.

1546
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:58,570
But you're not
telling me anything.

1547
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:00,045
What are you confused about?

1548
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:03,910
How is she?

1549
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:07,010
I tell people to
hope for the best,

1550
01:37:07,087 --> 01:37:09,521
and prepare for the worst.

1551
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:13,686
They let you get away with that?

1552
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:17,197
You're wrong to take
a desperate attitude.

1553
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:22,169
It won't do Emma any good
to get those signals.

1554
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:29,041
What's wrong now?

1555
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,145
I'm frustrated with that doctor.

1556
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:34,647
You're getting out.

1557
01:37:34,715 --> 01:37:38,151
You don't have
to stay here again.

1558
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:40,153
Unless the illness spreads.

1559
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:42,655
I really don't feel sick.

1560
01:37:42,723 --> 01:37:46,159
Come to New York.
My treat.

1561
01:37:47,728 --> 01:37:49,662
We'll have to see.

1562
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:52,995
Look at this letter from the kids.

1563
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:57,094
Teddy says he couldn't sleep,
but Melanie could.

1564
01:37:57,171 --> 01:38:00,663
Tommy thinks there's
nothing to be concerned about--

1565
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:02,003
I mean it!

1566
01:38:02,076 --> 01:38:04,476
You have some time.

1567
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:06,672
Come see New York.

1568
01:38:07,781 --> 01:38:11,683
Not a bad idea,
a vacation by yourself.

1569
01:38:11,752 --> 01:38:15,153
Take advantage of your freedom.

1570
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:17,952
I know you want to go.

1571
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:21,461
This isn't like taking
those kids to Disneyland...

1572
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:23,120
right before the end?

1573
01:38:23,197 --> 01:38:24,221
Stop!

1574
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:25,788
Ow!

1575
01:38:25,866 --> 01:38:27,163
Patsy, I'm kidding!

1576
01:38:27,234 --> 01:38:28,963
Okay!

1577
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:30,435
Oh, good.

1578
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:35,474
Do you feel funny
about leaving the kids?

1579
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:36,975
I'm not leaving them.

1580
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:39,478
I'm entrusting them
to their father.

1581
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:45,143
As long as your mother
and Rosie are in town--

1582
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:47,312
Not them. You.

1583
01:38:57,231 --> 01:38:58,163
Emma!

1584
01:38:58,232 --> 01:38:59,164
Huh?

1585
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:01,167
Emma, look! Look! Look!

1586
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:03,169
Are we there yet?

1587
01:39:03,237 --> 01:39:04,670
God! I'm here!

1588
01:39:04,738 --> 01:39:06,672
Isn't it beautiful?

1589
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:11,006
I want you to meet
some of my friends.

1590
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:14,179
Hi.

1591
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:15,180
Hi.

1592
01:39:15,249 --> 01:39:17,183
Emma, this is Lizbeth.

1593
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:18,616
Hi, Elizabeth.

1594
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:20,119
Hi.
It's Lizbeth.

1595
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:22,621
Isn't that what I said?

1596
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:26,217
You said, "Elizabeth."
It's Lizbeth.

1597
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:28,227
Two names?
Liz Beth?

1598
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:29,990
No, one. Lizbeth.

1599
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:31,395
Liz Beth?

1600
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:33,399
Never mind!

1601
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:34,627
This is Jane.

1602
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:36,135
Thank heavens!

1603
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:39,968
Here, that's Melanie.

1604
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,133
Oh!
Look at that!

1605
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:46,145
Teddy's the younger one,
Tommy's the older one.

1606
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:47,646
Oh, isn't that--

1607
01:39:47,715 --> 01:39:49,148
Oh! Oh!

1608
01:39:49,216 --> 01:39:51,548
The little girl.
She's incredible.

1609
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:54,109
Don't think
she don't know it.

1610
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:58,147
Patsy's got a real thing
going with her.

1611
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:01,160
Are you going back to work?

1612
01:40:01,228 --> 01:40:02,695
I never really worked.

1613
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:05,664
Well--

1614
01:40:05,733 --> 01:40:07,462
Well, that's okay.

1615
01:40:07,534 --> 01:40:08,660
Thanks.

1616
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:13,729
Great!

1617
01:40:17,244 --> 01:40:19,610
[ Woman ]
When did she find out?

1618
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,614
[ Patsy ]
About a month ago.

1619
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,120
What's wrong?

1620
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:29,120
Nothing.

1621
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:32,625
It was a great honor meeting you.

1622
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:33,625
Thanks.

1623
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:35,127
Those children are lucky...

1624
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:38,130
to have you for a mommy.

1625
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:41,634
Y'all go ahead.
Take the first cab.

1626
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,135
You're sure?

1627
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:44,636
Yeah.
That's fine.

1628
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,139
Bye-bye, Patsy.

1629
01:40:51,678 --> 01:40:53,805
You told them, didn't you?

1630
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,815
You don't mind, do you?

1631
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:57,316
Of course not.

1632
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:00,319
They're jerks.

1633
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:02,321
They don't know anything.

1634
01:41:02,389 --> 01:41:05,324
Why do they act like that?

1635
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:06,825
Talk to me!

1636
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:08,589
It's not you.

1637
01:41:08,662 --> 01:41:10,892
I don't mind them knowing.

1638
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,833
In two hours,

1639
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:17,928
two of them told me
they'd had abortions.

1640
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:20,769
Three of them
are divorced.

1641
01:41:20,841 --> 01:41:23,776
One hasn't talked
to her mother in years,

1642
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:26,938
and one has her little Natalie
in boarding school...

1643
01:41:27,014 --> 01:41:29,278
because she travels in her job?

1644
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:32,284
I mean, hell, Patsy, that's all--

1645
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:35,287
The one with the yeast disease...

1646
01:41:35,355 --> 01:41:38,290
that thought
she had vaginal herpes?

1647
01:41:38,358 --> 01:41:41,293
If that's fit
conversation for lunch,

1648
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:46,128
what's so god-awful terrible
about my little tumors?

1649
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,464
Yeah, of course, but--

1650
01:41:48,535 --> 01:41:51,527
What do you want me to do?

1651
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:54,540
Tell them it ain't so tragic!

1652
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:58,274
People do get better.

1653
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:03,246
Tell them it's okay
to talk about the cancer!

1654
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:12,184
Patsy tells us you have cancer.

1655
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:16,395
We should talk.

1656
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:17,828
I'm a nutritionist,

1657
01:42:17,898 --> 01:42:20,332
and my husband's with Ticketron.

1658
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:23,835
Thanks, Patsy.

1659
01:42:25,405 --> 01:42:26,337
Hello.

1660
01:42:26,406 --> 01:42:29,102
Flap?
Have you heard anything?

1661
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:30,438
No.

1662
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:32,843
Emma hasn't called you
either, huh?

1663
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:35,347
No. How are the children?

1664
01:42:35,415 --> 01:42:38,407
I wish I were so carefree.

1665
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:42,046
They have nothing
to feel ashamed about.

1666
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:46,388
You always seem to lose
your manners around me.

1667
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:47,791
Stop it, Flap.

1668
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:51,558
If you talk to Emma, don't
sound as frightened as you do.

1669
01:42:51,632 --> 01:42:54,066
I don't sound frightened!

1670
01:42:56,637 --> 01:42:58,070
Daddy--

1671
01:43:07,047 --> 01:43:08,344
Hi, mother.

1672
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:11,976
I can't talk for very long.

1673
01:43:12,052 --> 01:43:15,078
I think I'm coming home early.

1674
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:19,024
Not really.

1675
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:25,031
It's about time
we had this room.

1676
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:28,534
Mother, I can't believe
you did this.

1677
01:43:28,602 --> 01:43:32,538
Careful! They're worth more
than you'll ever make.

1678
01:43:32,606 --> 01:43:37,043
I grew up with her my whole life.
You can take it for a couple minutes.

1679
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:40,045
That's fine.
Thank you so much.

1680
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:43,048
Thank you.

1681
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:47,051
Hmm!

1682
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,815
Oh, they're wonderful.

1683
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,915
They look good
next to each other.

1684
01:44:00,634 --> 01:44:03,068
Help me with this, Melanie.

1685
01:44:03,136 --> 01:44:04,569
Gorgeous isn't everything.

1686
01:44:04,638 --> 01:44:06,572
This one, this one.

1687
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,073
Two more.

1688
01:44:13,647 --> 01:44:17,083
The response to
the drugs we tried...

1689
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:20,009
isn't what we hoped.

1690
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:25,525
There are investigatory drugs
which we are willing to utilize.

1691
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:28,618
However, if you
become incapacitated,

1692
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:30,526
or it becomes unreasonable...

1693
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:33,293
for you to handle your affairs,

1694
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:37,531
it might be wise
to make decisions now.

1695
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,543
Any questions?

1696
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:47,546
No.

1697
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,552
I know what you're saying.

1698
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:58,557
I have to figure out
what to do with my kids.

1699
01:45:19,446 --> 01:45:20,504
It's after 10:00.

1700
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:23,242
Give my daughter the pain shot.

1701
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,251
Mrs. Greenway, I was going to.

1702
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:26,684
Go ahead.

1703
01:45:26,753 --> 01:45:28,186
Just a few minutes.

1704
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:29,916
Please. It's after 10:00.

1705
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:32,618
Why must she have this pain?

1706
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:34,593
It's not my patient.

1707
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:36,526
It's time!
Do something!

1708
01:45:36,596 --> 01:45:40,532
She only has to
hold on until 10:00!

1709
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,033
It's past 10:00!

1710
01:45:42,102 --> 01:45:43,535
She's in pain!

1711
01:45:43,603 --> 01:45:46,037
Are you going to behave?

1712
01:45:46,106 --> 01:45:49,041
Give my daughter the shot!

1713
01:45:52,612 --> 01:45:55,046
Thank you very much.

1714
01:46:01,121 --> 01:46:03,555
Can I have 222, please?

1715
01:46:27,814 --> 01:46:29,304
Let's get her!

1716
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:31,078
I'm pushing Grandma in!

1717
01:46:31,151 --> 01:46:33,745
Don't you dare!
I mean it.

1718
01:46:35,122 --> 01:46:36,555
Come on.

1719
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:40,592
Say, "Hi, Granny."

1720
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:41,991
Hi, Granny.

1721
01:46:42,062 --> 01:46:43,222
Aurora?

1722
01:47:16,696 --> 01:47:18,061
Well,

1723
01:47:19,633 --> 01:47:24,570
who would have expected you
to be a nice guy?

1724
01:47:38,051 --> 01:47:39,575
Who?

1725
01:47:39,653 --> 01:47:42,087
It's good to see you.

1726
01:47:42,155 --> 01:47:43,588
Wow!

1727
01:47:57,671 --> 01:47:59,605
Take care of yourself.

1728
01:47:59,673 --> 01:48:01,106
I'll call you.

1729
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:08,113
I'm real glad I came.

1730
01:48:08,181 --> 01:48:11,116
It meant a lot to Emma.

1731
01:48:11,184 --> 01:48:13,618
It meant a lot to me.

1732
01:48:14,688 --> 01:48:16,121
I'll call you.

1733
01:48:16,189 --> 01:48:18,555
No. If there's someone there,

1734
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:22,061
I'll hear that funny sound
in yourvoice.

1735
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:24,562
Who cares?
I don't care.

1736
01:48:24,631 --> 01:48:26,064
I love you.

1737
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:45,917
Garrett!

1738
01:48:47,153 --> 01:48:48,085
Garrett!

1739
01:48:49,155 --> 01:48:50,588
Come here.

1740
01:48:55,562 --> 01:48:56,995
I was curious.

1741
01:48:57,063 --> 01:49:00,521
Any reaction to my
telling you I love you?

1742
01:49:02,168 --> 01:49:06,229
I was just inches
from a clean getaway.

1743
01:49:06,306 --> 01:49:08,536
You're stuck, so face it.

1744
01:49:10,844 --> 01:49:13,779
I don't know what else to say...

1745
01:49:13,847 --> 01:49:15,872
except my stock answer.

1746
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:17,576
Which is?

1747
01:49:17,651 --> 01:49:20,449
I love you, too, kid.

1748
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:43,074
Bye.

1749
01:49:53,053 --> 01:49:55,578
I took him to the airport,

1750
01:49:55,655 --> 01:49:58,089
and we were standing there...

1751
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:00,991
hugging and kissing
and saying good-bye,

1752
01:50:01,061 --> 01:50:02,995
and you know what?

1753
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:04,587
What?

1754
01:50:04,664 --> 01:50:07,599
I told him I loved him.

1755
01:50:07,667 --> 01:50:10,158
You know what
his reaction was?

1756
01:50:10,236 --> 01:50:14,104
I don't give a shit.
I'm sick.

1757
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:18,940
Not everything is about you.

1758
01:50:19,012 --> 01:50:22,539
I've got a lot to figure out.

1759
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,050
I don't want to fight anymore.

1760
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:27,052
What do you mean?

1761
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,054
When do we fight?

1762
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:30,453
When do we fight?

1763
01:50:30,523 --> 01:50:32,047
You amaze me.

1764
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:35,561
I always think of us as fighting.

1765
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:37,563
That's from your end.

1766
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:41,067
That's 'cause you're
never satisfied with me.

1767
01:51:42,395 --> 01:51:45,330
Have you seen her yet today?

1768
01:51:45,398 --> 01:51:48,265
Yes. I've been with her...

1769
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:52,270
most of last night
and today, as usual.

1770
01:51:52,338 --> 01:51:54,272
I haven't, uh...

1771
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:58,140
really talked to the kids yet.

1772
01:51:58,211 --> 01:52:01,442
I'm not sure
how much they realize,

1773
01:52:01,514 --> 01:52:04,449
but they know
something bad's happening.

1774
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:07,645
Flap, Patsy wants
to raise Melanie...

1775
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,951
and maybe the boys.

1776
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:12,253
They should be with me.

1777
01:52:12,325 --> 01:52:15,590
What can you be thinking about?

1778
01:52:15,662 --> 01:52:18,290
Raising three children,

1779
01:52:18,364 --> 01:52:20,764
working full time,
and chasing women,

1780
01:52:20,834 --> 01:52:23,029
requires more energy
than you have.

1781
01:52:23,103 --> 01:52:26,300
A nice quality about you...

1782
01:52:26,372 --> 01:52:28,806
is you recognize your weaknesses.

1783
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:31,309
Don't lose that quality now,

1784
01:52:31,377 --> 01:52:34,312
when you need it the most.

1785
01:52:38,051 --> 01:52:39,985
You have no right...

1786
01:52:40,053 --> 01:52:41,987
nor any invitation...

1787
01:52:42,055 --> 01:52:47,652
to discuss where or how
my children live.

1788
01:53:05,512 --> 01:53:07,776
From what the doctor says...

1789
01:53:07,847 --> 01:53:10,839
it's time we have the talk now.

1790
01:53:10,917 --> 01:53:15,786
Do you know how much
I hate the idea of losing you?

1791
01:53:17,524 --> 01:53:18,786
Yes.

1792
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:21,787
Well, no--

1793
01:53:21,861 --> 01:53:25,456
nobody seems to know that
except you.

1794
01:53:26,533 --> 01:53:28,262
I just-- Well.

1795
01:53:28,334 --> 01:53:29,460
What?

1796
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:32,795
I'm thinking about my identity,

1797
01:53:32,872 --> 01:53:34,806
and not having one anymore.

1798
01:53:34,874 --> 01:53:38,469
Who am I, if I'm not
the man who's failing Emma?

1799
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:41,139
You didn't fail me, Flap.

1800
01:53:41,214 --> 01:53:44,149
I feel like I'm
sucking after forgiveness,

1801
01:53:44,217 --> 01:53:46,014
which I probably am.

1802
01:53:46,085 --> 01:53:50,146
You were no more
terrible than I was.

1803
01:53:50,223 --> 01:53:53,249
Except for the cheating.

1804
01:53:53,326 --> 01:53:56,261
You're right.
Let's not do this.

1805
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:00,265
We had problems.

1806
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:04,770
It was never over
whether we loved each other.

1807
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:10,933
Oh, God! That tie!

1808
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:13,945
I can't believe you wore that!

1809
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:16,777
The mess it must've been finding it.

1810
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:19,284
The house still isn't in one piece.

1811
01:54:19,352 --> 01:54:22,788
It was in the last box I looked in.

1812
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:24,289
I'll bet.

1813
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:26,951
God, you're easy to please.

1814
01:54:27,026 --> 01:54:30,325
Why couldn't I do more of it?

1815
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:34,966
I'm so glad we're talking.

1816
01:54:35,034 --> 01:54:37,969
It means so much to me,

1817
01:54:38,037 --> 01:54:41,473
that we can still feel like this.

1818
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:44,066
I swear, I don't know.

1819
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:48,413
Listen, I am getting tired.

1820
01:54:50,483 --> 01:54:53,680
You really want to raise them?

1821
01:55:05,999 --> 01:55:09,935
I never thought
I'd give up my kids.

1822
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:13,438
It's a lot of work.

1823
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:16,942
As hard as you think it is,

1824
01:55:17,010 --> 01:55:20,446
you end up wishing
it were that easy.

1825
01:55:20,513 --> 01:55:23,004
Where do you want them?

1826
01:55:23,082 --> 01:55:27,451
I don't want them
to end up with Janice.

1827
01:55:28,521 --> 01:55:30,614
She's not so bad.

1828
01:55:35,528 --> 01:55:39,965
I really don't think
they should be with you.

1829
01:55:45,972 --> 01:55:47,405
Well,

1830
01:55:48,975 --> 01:55:51,910
to tell you
the honest truth,

1831
01:55:53,479 --> 01:55:55,845
I'd probably screw it up.

I'll really miss them.

1833

Maybe Patsy should take them.

1834
01:56:10,196 --> 01:56:12,596
It'd be easy for me...

summers in New York.

1836
01:56:16,169 --> 01:56:18,603
Patsy really only
wants Melanie.

1837
01:56:18,671 --> 01:56:20,502
Mother should have them.

1838
01:56:20,573 --> 01:56:22,939
You can see them anytime.

1839
01:56:23,009 --> 01:56:26,445
You'll decide things
for them and everything.

1840
01:56:26,512 --> 01:56:29,140
She'll make that very difficult.

She won't.

1842
01:56:35,521 --> 01:56:39,457
I guess they should
be with your mother.

1843

Is it terrible to say...

1853
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,773
I can't stand
seeing your mother...

1854

getting her hands
on that little girl?

1855

I'd love to raise
that little girl.

but Teddy couldn't spare her.

I can't stall anymore, all right?

1859

You go out there
and send the boys in.

No.

Not so bad.

You both have beautiful eyes.

Your hair's too long.

You'll remember when
I bought you the baseball glove,

1918

when you thought
we were broke;

1919

or when I read you those stories.

1920

Or when I let you goof off instead of
mowing the lawn-- lots of things.

You'll realize that you love me,

and maybe you'll feel badly
because you never told me,
