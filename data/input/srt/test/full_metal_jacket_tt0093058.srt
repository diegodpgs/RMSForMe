1
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,420
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

2
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,658
From now on,
you will speak only when spoken to...

3
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,430
... and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be ""sir.""

4
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,470
Do you maggots understand that?

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,868
Sir, yes, sir.

6
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,341
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

7
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,877
Sir, yes, sir.

8
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,404
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

9
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,916
... you will be a weapon.

10
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,112
You will be a minister of death
praying for war.

11
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,087
But until that day, you are pukes.

12
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,625
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

13
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,161
You are not even human-fucking-beings.

14
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:16,223
You are nothing but unorganized,
grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

15
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,269
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

16
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,135
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

17
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,401
I am hard but I am fair.

18
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,841
There is no racial bigotry here.

19
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:31,143
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

20
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,808
Here, you are all equally worthless.

21
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,945
And my orders are to weed out
all non-hackers...

22
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,956
... who do not pack the gear
to serve in my beloved Corps.

23
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,117
Do you maggots understand that?

24
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,523
Sir, yes, sir.

25
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,425
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

26
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,589
Sir, yes, sir!

27
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:51,032
-What's your name, scumbag?
-Sir, Private Brown, sir!

28
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,760
Bullshit. From now on
you're Private Snowball.

29
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,272
-Do you like that name?
-Sir, yes, sir!

30
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,138
Well, there's one thing
that you won't like, Snowball:

31
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,473
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

32
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,741
... on a daily basis in my mess hall.

33
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,407
Sir, yes, sir!

34
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,147
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

35
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,017
Who said that?

36
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,147
Who the fuck said that?

37
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,784
Who's the slimy little communist-shit,
twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...

38
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,591
... who just signed
his own death warrant?

39
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,958
Nobody, huh?

40
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,832
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.

41
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,599
I will P. T. you all until you fucking die.

42
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,539
I'll P. T. you until your assholes
are sucking buttermilk.

43
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,566
-Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?
-Sir, no, sir.

44
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,944
You piece of shit. You look
like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

45
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,473
-Sir, no, sir.
-Sir, I said it, sir.

46
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,345
Well, no shit.

47
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,858
What have we got here?
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.

48
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,916
I admire your honesty.

49
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,555
Hell, I like you. You can come over
to my house and fuck my sister.

50
00:03:56,202 --> 00:04:00,434
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.

51
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,632
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

52
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,039
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.

53
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,776
Now get up. Get on your feet.

54
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:12,680
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck.

55
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,208
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?

56
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,448
-Sir, to kill, sir.
-So you're a killer?

57
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,480
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Let me see your war face.

58
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,050
-Sir?
-You've got a war face?

59
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,062
That's a war face.
Now let me see your war face.

60
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,763
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

61
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,530
You don't scare me. Work on it.

62
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,301
Sir, yes, sir!

63
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,740
What's your excuse?

64
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,277
Sir, excuse for what, sir?

65
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,280
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?

66
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,475
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Well, thank you very much.

67
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,213
-Can I be in charge for a while?
-Sir, yes, sir.

68
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,517
-Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?
-Sir, I am, sir.

69
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,751
-Do I make you nervous?
-Sir....

70
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,623
Sir what?
Were you about to call me an asshole?

71
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,129
-Sir, no, sir.
-How tall are you, private?

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,790
Sir, 5'9"", sir.

73
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,732
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

74
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,202
You trying to squeeze an inch
in on me somewhere?

75
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,365
-Sir, no, sir.
-Bullshit. It looks like the best part of you...

76
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:14,274
... ran down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,777
I think you've been cheated.

78
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,046
Where the hell are you from, private?

79
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,708
-Sir, Texas, sir.
-Holy dogshit. Texas?

80
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,947
Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy.

81
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:27,615
And you don't much look like a steer to me,
so that kind of narrows it down.

82
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,785
-Do you suck dicks?
-Sir, no, sir.

83
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,260
-Are you a peter puffer?
-Sir, no, sir.

84
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,855
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

85
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,663
... and not even have the goddamn common
courtesy to give him a reach around.

86
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,931
I'll be watching you.

87
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,701
Did your parents have any children
that lived?

88
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,107
-Sir, yes, sir.
-I'll bet they regret that.

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,204
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

90
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,977
-What's your name, fat-body?
-Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

91
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,847
Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?

92
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,650
-Sir, no, sir.
-That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?

93
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,781
-Sir, no, sir.
-Do you suck dicks?

94
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,884
-Sir, no, sir.
-Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...

95
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,019
-... through a garden hose.
-Sir, no, sir.

96
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,632
I don't like the name Lawrence.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,927
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

98
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,731
-From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
-Sir, yes, sir.

99
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,567
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
You think I'm funny?

100
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,836
-Sir, no, sir.
-Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.

101
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,899
Sir, yes, sir.

102
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,207
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.

103
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,073
-Sir, I'm trying, sir.
-Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds...

104
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,346
... exactly three fucking seconds...

105
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,082
... to wipe that stupid-looking grin
off your face...

106
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,251
... or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you.

107
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,954
One. Two. Three.

108
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:43,762
-Sir, I can't help it, sir.
-Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.

109
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,468
Now choke yourself.

110
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,700
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

111
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,906
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.

112
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,915
Now lean forward and choke yourself.

113
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,914
-Are you through grinning?
-Sir, yes, sir.

114
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,649
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

115
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,024
Sir, yes, sir.

116
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,017
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

117
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,996
Sir, yes, sir.

118
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,057
That's enough. Get on your feet.

119
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,636
Pyle, you had best square your ass away
and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

120
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,406
... or I will definitely fuck you up.

121
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,537
Sir, yes, sir.

122
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,141
Left, right, left, right
left, right, left.

123
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,653
Left, right, left, right, left.

124
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,451
Left, right, left, right, left....

125
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,253
Parris Island, South Carolina...

126
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,659
... the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

127
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,461
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

128
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,468
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

129
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,402
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

130
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,408
Mama rolled over
And this is what she said

131
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,944
Mama rolled over, this is what she said

132
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,037
-Oh, give me some, give me some
-Oh, give me some, give me some

133
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,514
-P. T.
-P. T.

134
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,016
-P. T.
-P. T.

135
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,517
-Good for you
-Good for you

136
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,178
-And good for me
-And good for me

137
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,620
-Good
-Good

138
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,521
Up in the morning to the rising sun

139
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,185
Up in the morning to the rising sun

140
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,127
Gonna run all day till the running's done

141
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,427
Gonna run all day till the running's done

142
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,436
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

143
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,029
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

144
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,097
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

145
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,338
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

146
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,042
Left, right, left, right, left.

147
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,142
Your left shoulder.

148
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,183
Left, right, left. Port.

149
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,159
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

150
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,027
Left shoulder.

151
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,868
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

152
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,565
-Sir, I don't know, sir.
-You are dumb, Private Pyle...

153
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,008
... but do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

154
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,545
-Sir, no, sir.
-Then you did that on purpose.

155
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,604
-You wanna be different.
-Sir, no, sir.

156
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,674
-What side was that, Private Pyle?
-Sir, left side, sir.

157
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,382
-Are you sure, Private Pyle?
-Sir, yes, sir.

158
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,120
-What side was that, Private Pyle?
-Sir, right side, sir.

159
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,662
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

160
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,458
Pick up your fucking cover.

161
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,861
Sir, yes, sir.

162
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,868
Your left shoulder.

163
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,103
Left, right, left. Port.

164
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,137
Left shoulder.

165
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,638
Your right shoulder.

166
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:50,808
Left, right, left, right.
Your left shoulder.

167
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,719
Left, two, three, four.

168
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,419
Your right shoulder.

169
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,192
Tonight you pukes will sleep
with your rifles.

170
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,862
You will give your rifle a girl's name.

171
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,239
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

172
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:17,872
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

173
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,214
... through her purty pink panties
are over.

174
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,447
You're married to this piece.

175
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,286
This weapon of iron and wood.

176
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,657
And you will be faithful.

177
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,193
Arms.

178
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,565
Prepare to mount.

179
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,098
Mount.

180
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,472
Port.

181
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,548
Pray.

182
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,280
This is my rifle.

183
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,949
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

184
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,790
My rifle is my best friend.

185
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,625
It is my life.

186
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,088
I must master it
as I must master my life.

187
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,228
Without me, my rifle is useless.

188
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,262
Without my rifle, I am useless.

189
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,307
I must fire my rifle true.

190
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:24,506
I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

191
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,642
I must shoot him before he shoots me.

192
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,344
I will.

193
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,184
Before God, I swear this creed.

194
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,055
My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

195
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,492
We are the masters of our enemy.

196
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,155
We are the saviors of my life.

197
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,532
So be it until there is no enemy,
but peace.

198
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,400
Amen.

199
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,734
Arm.

200
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,207
At ease.

201
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,605
Good night, ladies.

202
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,412
Good night, sir.

203
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,380
-Hit it, sweetheart.
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.

204
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,711
Right shoulder.

205
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:14,484
That is not
your daddy's shotgun, Cowboy.

206
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,866
Left shoulder.

207
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:26,534
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

208
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,210
Port.

209
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:37,047
Four inches from your chest, Pyle.
Four inches.

210
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,183
This is my rifle, this is my gun

211
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,850
This is for fighting, this is for fun

212
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,451
This is my rifle, this is my gun

213
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,020
This is for fighting, this is for fun

214
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,691
This is my rifle, this is my gun

215
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,293
This is for fighting, this is for fun

216
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,895
This is my rifle, this is my gun

217
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,498
This is for fighting, this is for fun

218
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,043
This is my rifle, this is my gun

219
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,977
This is for fighting, this is for fun

220
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,884
You ' re bouncing.

221
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,934
T en fucking seconds.

222
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:32,965
It should take you no less than 1 0
fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.

223
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,635
Quickly, move it out.

224
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,442
There ain't one swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

225
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:42,883
... until they can get this obstacle down
to less than 1 0 fucking seconds.

226
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,369
Next two privates. Quickly.

227
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,311
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.

228
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,542
Next two privates. Quickly.

229
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,084
Hurry up. Get up there.

230
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,950
-Private Joker, are you a killer?
-Sir, yes, sir.

231
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,988
Let me hear your war cry.

232
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,890
Next two privates, go. Quickly.

233
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,190
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.

234
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,094
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

235
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:32,158
Don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.

236
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,832
If God wanted you up there, he would have
miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?

237
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,739
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

238
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,107
-Sir, yes, sir.
-What is the matter with you?

239
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,479
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on
top of that obstacle, you could get up there.

240
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,347
-Couldn't you?
-Sir, yes, sir.

241
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,718
Your ass looks like about 1 50 pounds
of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?

242
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,325
Sir, yes, sir.

243
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,061
One for the commandant.

244
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,258
One for the Corps.

245
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,199
Get up there. Pull.

246
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:10,070
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.

247
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,268
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

248
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,970
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

249
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,743
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.

250
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,582
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot
do one single pull-up?

251
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,113
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.

252
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,285
Get up there, Snowball.

253
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,092
Get up here, fat-boy.

254
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,530
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.

255
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,900
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

256
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,372
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.

257
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,070
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down.

258
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,442
That would break my fucking heart.

259
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,074
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

260
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,780
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

261
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,688
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.

262
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,385
Are you quitting on me?

263
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,588
Well, are you?

264
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:11,054
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

265
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,727
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.

266
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,636
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.

267
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,004
Now. Move it.

268
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:24,536
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you
cannot contaminate the rest of the world.

269
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,345
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

270
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,115
... if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo.

271
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,719
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.

272
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,953
Quickly. Move it out.

273
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,726
Were you born a fat, slimy,
scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

274
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,233
Or did you have to work on it?

275
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,999
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

276
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,736
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?

277
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,470
Move it.

278
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,811
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?
Are you going to die on me?

279
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,010
Do it now.

280
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,645
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

281
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,285
Do you feel dizzy?

282
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,793
Do you feel faint?

283
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:17,491
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on.

284
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,130
Quickly, ladies. Assholes and elbows.
Move it out.

285
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,832
Get up here.

286
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,673
Move it. Move it, move it, move it.

287
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,805
Quickly.

288
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,771
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

289
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,033
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

290
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,068
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

291
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,127
Today is Sunday.
Divine worship at 0800.

292
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,697
Get your bunks made
and get your uniforms on.

293
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,801
Police call will commence
in two minutes.

294
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,379
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

295
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,107
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Sir, yes, sir.

296
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,845
As soon as you finish your bunks,
I want you two turds to clean the head.

297
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,081
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-I want that head so sanitary...

298
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,318
... that the Virgin Mary herself would be
proud to go in there and take a dump.

299
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,860
-Sir, yes, sir.
-Sir, yes, sir.

300
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,260
Private Joker, do you believe
in the Virgin Mary?

301
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,229
Sir, no, sir.

302
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,100
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

303
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,469
Sir, the private said, "" No, sir,"" sir.

304
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,806
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

305
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,144
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...

306
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,513
... or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

307
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,019
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary,
don't you?

308
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,451
Sir, negative, sir.

309
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,115
Private Joker,
are you trying to offend me?

310
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,624
Sir, negative, sir.

311
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,855
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong...

312
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,922
... and the senior drill instructor will
beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

313
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,660
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

314
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,670
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

315
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,728
Private Snowball.

316
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,537
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

317
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,409
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.

318
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,005
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-Disappear, scumbag.

319
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,915
-Sir, aye, aye, sir.
-Private Pyle.

320
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,012
-Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
-From now on...

321
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,490
... Private Joker is your new squad leader
and you will bunk with him.

322
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,958
He'll teach you everything.

323
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,324
-He'll teach you how to pee.
-Sir, yes, sir.

324
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,594
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant,
but he's got guts and guts is enough.

325
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,498
Now, you ladies, carry on.

326
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,866
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

327
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,838
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

328
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,583
Operating-rod handle.

329
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,247
Operating-rod guide.

330
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,890
And the left one over the right.

331
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,155
Right one over the left.

332
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,831
Left one over the right.

333
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,266
The right one over the left.

334
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,072
Just throw your other leg over.

335
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,576
Attaboy.

336
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:24,643
That's it. Now just pull the next one over
and you're home free.

337
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,149
Ready?

338
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,153
Just throw it over.

339
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,801
Attaboy.

340
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,939
Set it down.

341
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,269
All right?

342
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,303
There you go.

343
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,114
Congratulations, Leonard.

344
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,880
You did it.

345
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,682
Fold the blanket
and the sheet back together.

346
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,192
Make a four-inch fold.

347
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,057
Okay? Got it?

348
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,120
You do it.

349
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,994
Right shoulder.

350
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,264
Your left shoulder.

351
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,439
Port.

352
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,747
Order.

353
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,266
Your right shoulder.

354
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,274
Square these weapons away.

355
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,305
My Corps' arms should be
parallel to the....

356
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,751
The deadliest weapon in the world...

357
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,782
... is a Marine and his rifle.

358
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,454
It is your killer instinct
which must be harnessed...

359
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:18,694
... if you expect to survive in combat.

360
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,397
Your rifle is only a tool.

361
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,134
It is a hard heart that kills.

362
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:30,768
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

363
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,975
... you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

364
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,143
You will not kill.

365
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,687
You will become dead-Marine.

366
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,190
And then you will be in a world of shit.

367
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,090
Because Marines...

368
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,857
... are not allowed to die
without permission.

369
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,694
Do you maggots understand?

370
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,392
Sir, yes, sir.

371
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,769
I love working for Uncle Sam

372
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,705
I love working for Uncle Sam

373
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,641
Lets me know just who I am

374
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,611
Lets me know just who I am

375
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,616
One, two, three, four

384
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,726
I don 't know, but I've been told

385
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,671
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

386
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,641
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

387
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,144
-Good
-Good

388
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,679

00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,756
-Good for me
-Good for me

395
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,851
Trim them.

396
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,595
Toe jam.

397
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,335
Pop that blister.

398
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,903
Jesus H. Christ.

399
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:16,082
Private Pyle,
why is your footlocker unlocked?

400
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,414
Sir, I don't know, sir.

401
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,047
Private Pyle, if there is one thing
in this world that I hate...

402
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,525
... it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?

403
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,256
-Sir, yes, sir.
-lf it wasn't for dickheads like you...

404
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,992
... there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?

405
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,124
-Sir, no, sir.
-Get down.

406
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,330
Well, now, let's just see
if there's anything missing.

407
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,109
Holy Jesus.

408
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,080
What is that?

409
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,846
What the fuck is that?

410
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,716
What is that, Private Pyle?

411
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,152
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

412
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,691
-A jelly doughnut?
-Sir, yes, sir.

413
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,921
-How did it get here?
-Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.

414
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,224
Is chow allowed in the barracks,
Private Pyle?

415
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,130
-Sir, no, sir.
-Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?

416
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,669
-Sir, no, sir.
-And why not, Private Pyle?

417
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,500
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

418
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:14,702
-Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
-Sir, yes, sir.

419
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,441
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?

420
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,573
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

421
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,846
Because you were hungry.

422
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:31,047
Private Pyle has dishonored himself...

423
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,857
... and dishonored the platoon.

424
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,991
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed.

425
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:43,061
I have failed
because you have not helped me.

426
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:47,302
You people have not given Private Pyle...

427
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,674
... the proper motivation.

428
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:55,342
So from now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

429
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,784
... I will not punish him.

430
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,447
I will punish all of you.

431
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,685
And the way I see it, ladies...

432
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,921
... you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

433
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,793
Now get on your faces.

434
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,930
Open your mouth.

435
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,594
They're paying for it, you eat it.

436
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,139
Ready, exercise.

437
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,937
One, two, three, four

438
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,602
I love the Marine Corps

439
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,147
One, two, three, four

440
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,706
I love the Marine Corps

441
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,309
One, two, three, four

442
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,820
I love the Marine Corps

443
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,482
One, two, three, four

444
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,992
I love the Marine Corps

445
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,529
One, two, three, four....

446
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,724
You really look like shit today, Leonard.

447
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,805
Joker.

448
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,977
Everybody hates me now.

449
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,383
Even you.

450
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,755
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

451
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,421
You just keep making mistakes.

452
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,893
Getting everybody in trouble.

453
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,360
I can't do anything right.

454
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,794
I need help.

455
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,676
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

456
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,542
I'm really trying.

457
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,846
Tuck your shirt in.

458
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,248
One, two, three, 1 9.

459
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,453
One, two, three, 20.

460
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,689
One, two, three, 21.

461
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,891
One, two, three, 22.

462
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,990
One, two, three, 23.

463
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,195
One, two, three, 24.

464
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,363
One, two, three, 25.

465
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,429
One, two, three, 26.

466
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,635
One, two, three, 27.

467
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,803
One, two, three, 28.

468
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,903
One, two, three, 29.

469
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,574
One, two, three, 30.

470
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,861
Do it.

471
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,234
Do it.

472
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,713
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fat-boy.

473
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,846
Port.

474
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,076
Left shoulder.

475
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,087
Right shoulder.

476
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,254
Port.

477
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,223
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

478
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:43,727
Semper fi, do or die.
Gung ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

479
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,035
What makes the grass grow?

480
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,176
Blood, blood, blood.

481
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,076
What do we do for a living, ladies?

482
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,944
Kill, kill, kill.

483
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,709
I can't hear you.

484
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,581
Kill, kill, kill.

485
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,814
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

486
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,618
Kill, kill, kill.

487
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,326
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?

488
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,323
None of you dumb-asses knows?

489
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,663
Private Cowboy.

490
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:17,194
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those
people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.

491
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,208
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 1 2 people...

492
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,576
... from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas.

493
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:27,638
From distances of up to 400 yards.

494
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,651
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

495
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,881
Private Snowball.

496
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,387
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

497
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,393
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?

498
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,886
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.

499
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,023
All right, knock it off.

500
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,091
Two hundred and fifty feet.

501
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:51,470
He was 250 feet away
and shooting at a moving target.

502
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:57,240
Oswald got off three rounds with an old
ltalian bolt-action rifle in only six seconds...

503
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,873
... and scored two hits,
including a head shot.

504
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:05,216
Do any of you people know where
these individuals learned how to shoot?

505
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,751
Private Joker.

506
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,848
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

507
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,553
In the Marines. Outstanding.

508
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,690
Those individuals showed what one
motivated Marine and his rifle can do.

509
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,429
And before you ladies leave my island...

510
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,938
... you will all be able
to do the same thing.

511
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,690
Today...

512
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,024
... is Christmas.

513
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:53,398
There will be a magic show at 0930.

514
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:57,332
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

515
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:02,070
... about how the free world
will conquer communism...

516
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:06,876
... with the aid of God and a few Marines.

517
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:11,343
God has a hard-on for Marines...

518
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:16,186
... because we kill everything we see.

519
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,750
He plays his games...

520
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,626
... we play ours.

521
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:26,657
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

522
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:32,196
... we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls.

523
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,936
God was here before the Marine Corps.

524
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,107
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

525
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:43,981
... but your ass belongs to the Corps.

526
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,111
Do you ladies understand?

527
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,282
-Sir, yes, sir.
-I can't hear you.

528
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,291
Sir, yes, sir.

529
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,367
It's been swabbed and brushed.

530
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,536
Everything...

531
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,273
... is clean.

532
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,944
Beautiful.

533
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,179
So that it slides perfect.

534
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,784
Nice.

535
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,254
Everything clean.

536
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,688
Oiled.

537
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,922
So that your action is beautiful.

538
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,137
Smooth Charlene.

539
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,889
Leonard talks to his rifle.

540
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,763
Yeah.

541
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,205
I don't think Leonard
can hack it anymore.

542
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,145
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

543
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,677
It don't surprise me.

544
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,567
I wanna slip my tube steak
into your sister.

545
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,836
What will you take in trade?

546
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,967
What do you got?

547
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,222
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

548
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,093
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

549
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,132
Sir, yes, sir.

550
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,302
What's your sixth general order?

551
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,965
Sir, the sixth general order
is to receive and obey...

552
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,533
... and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

553
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,475
... all orders....

554
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,411
Sir, the private's sixth general....

555
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,005
The private has been instructed
but does not know.

556
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,451
You slimy scumbag,
get on your face and give me 25.

557
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,715
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

558
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,294
How many counts in that movement
you just executed?

559
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,627
-Sir, four counts, sir.
-What's the idea of looking in the chamber?

560
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:48,067
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving
the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.

561
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,729
What's your fifth general order?

562
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:53,934
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir.

563
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,908
What's this weapon's name,
Private Pyle?

564
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,913
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir.

565
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,847
Private Pyle, you are definitely
born-again hard.

566
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,614
Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

567
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,883
Sir, yes, sir.

568
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,990
I don 't want no teenage queen

569
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,758
I don 't want no teenage queen

570
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,595
I just want my M14

571
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,363
I just want my M14

572
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,235
If I die in a combat zone

573
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,968
If I die in a combat zone

574
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,704
Box me up and ship me home

575
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,508
Box me up and ship me home

576
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:35,311
Pin my medals upon my chest

577
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,080
Pin my medals upon my chest

578
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,850
Tell my mom I done my best

579
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,924
Tell my mom I done my best

580
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:49,032
Graduation is only a few days away...

581
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:53,769
... and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

582
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:57,904
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

583
00:37:58,483 --> 00:38:03,910
The drill instructors are proud to see
that we are growing beyond their control.

584
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:07,679
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

585
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,817
The Marine Corps wants killers.

586
00:38:10,996 --> 00:38:14,762
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

587
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:17,731
Men without fear.

588
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:24,265
Today, you people are
no longer maggots.

589
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:29,406
Today, you are Marines.

590
00:38:29,981 --> 00:38:32,814
You 're part of a brotherhood.

591
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:37,080
From now on, until the day you die...

592
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:39,553
... wherever you are...

593
00:38:39,725 --> 00:38:43,217
... every Marine is your brother.

594
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:47,423
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

595
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,830
Some of you will not come back.

596
00:38:51,002 --> 00:38:53,197
But always remember this:

597
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:55,236
Marines die.

598
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:57,932
That's what we're here for.

599
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,204
But the Marine Corps lives forever...

600
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:06,112
... and that means you live forever.

601
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:11,649
-Peckett.
-Sir, yes, sir.

602

0300, lnfantry.

603

-Adams.
-Sir, yes, sir.

606
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:21,026
1 800, Engineers.

607
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,723
You go out and find mines.

608
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:24,698
-Cowboy.
-Sir, yes, sir.

609

0300, lnfantry.

-Sir, yes, sir.

0300, lnfantry.

612
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:32,034
-Joker.
-Sir, yes, sir.

613
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,338
421 2, Basic Military Journalism.

614
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:37,573
You gotta be shitting me, Joker.

615
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:39,273
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

616
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:41,476
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

617
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:44,076
Sir, I wrote for
my high school newspaper, sir.

618
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,919
Jesus H. Christ.
You're not a writer, you're a killer.

619
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:49,321
A killer, yes, sir.

620
00:39:49,494 --> 00:39:51,052
Gomer Pyle.

621
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:53,823
-Gomer Pyle.
-Sir, yes, sir.

622
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:57,924
You forget your fucking name?
0300, lnfantry. You made it.

623
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:00,230
-Perkins.
-Sir, yes, sir.

624
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:07,242
Our last night on the island.

625
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:09,937
I draw fire watch.

626
00:41:12,744 --> 00:41:15,872
Hi, Joker.

627
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:41,396
Are those live rounds?

628
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:51,234
Seven-six-two millimeter.

629
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:56,274
Full metal jacket.

630
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:06,785
Leonard...

631
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:10,822
... if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

632
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:15,063
... we'll both be in a world of shit.

633
00:42:18,343 --> 00:42:20,641
I am...

634
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,369
... in a world...

635
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:28,442
... of shit.

636
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,918
Left shoulder.

637
00:42:35,493 --> 00:42:36,892
Right shoulder.

638
00:42:39,998 --> 00:42:41,260
Lock and load.

639
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:47,436
Order.

640
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:52,072
This is my rifle.

641
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:55,007
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

642
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:59,580
My rifle is my best friend.
It is my life.

643
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:02,242
Get back in your bunks.

644
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,581
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

645
00:43:04,756 --> 00:43:09,614
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

646
00:43:09,794 --> 00:43:13,127
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

647
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:16,131
Why is Private Pyle
holding that weapon?

648
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:19,657
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

649
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,035
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform the senior drill instructor...

650
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:27,941
... that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir.

651
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,251
Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

652
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:42,188
... and you listen good.

653
00:43:42,627 --> 00:43:44,891
I want that weapon...

654
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:47,691
... and I want it now.

655
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:52,465
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet...

656
00:43:52,637 --> 00:43:55,470
... and step back away from it.

657
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:06,406
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

658
00:44:06,584 --> 00:44:10,850
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

659
00:44:36,414 --> 00:44:38,473
Easy, Leonard.

660
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:44,012
Go easy, man.

661
00:45:09,714 --> 00:45:10,942
No!

662
00:46:11,442 --> 00:46:13,103
Hey, baby.

663
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:16,304
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

664
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:19,109
Not just this minute.

665
00:46:19,284 --> 00:46:22,583
Well, baby, me so horny.

666
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:24,915
Me so horny.

667
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:27,649
Me love you long time.

668
00:46:28,193 --> 00:46:29,421
You party?

669
00:46:29,594 --> 00:46:31,721
Yeah, we might party.

670
00:46:31,896 --> 00:46:34,694
-How much?
-Fifteen dollar.

671
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:38,893
-Fifteen dollars for both of us.
-No. Each you $1 5.

672
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,992
Me love you long time.

673
00:46:41,172 --> 00:46:43,800
Me so horny.

674
00:46:43,975 --> 00:46:46,273
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

675
00:46:46,444 --> 00:46:49,709
-Five dollars each.
-Me sucky-sucky.

676
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:52,475
Me love you too much.

677
00:46:53,885 --> 00:46:57,184
Five dollars is all my mom
allows me to spend.

678
00:46:57,355 --> 00:47:00,279
Okay. Ten dollar each.

679
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,949
What do we get for $1 0?

680
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:05,925
Everything you want.

681
00:47:06,097 --> 00:47:09,260
-Everything?
-Everything.

682
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:14,397
Well, old buddy, feel like spending
some of your hard-earned money?

683
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:16,460
Just a minute.

684
00:47:16,808 --> 00:47:20,938
You know, half these gook whores
are serving officers in the Vietcong.

685
00:47:21,112 --> 00:47:22,875
The other half have got TB.

686
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,570
Be sure you only fuck
the ones that cough.

687
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:18,231
That little sucker really had
some moves on him, didn't he?

688
00:48:18,403 --> 00:48:20,064
Yeah.

689
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:24,467
You know what really pisses me off
about these people?

690
00:48:24,642 --> 00:48:25,973
What?

691
00:48:26,177 --> 00:48:29,999
We're supposed to be helping them, and
they shit all over us every chance they get.

692
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:32,137
I just can't feature that.

693
00:48:32,317 --> 00:48:35,775
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.

694
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:40,944
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.

695
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:43,081
I've been in country
almost three months...

696
00:48:43,261 --> 00:48:46,025
... and all I do is take handshake shots
at award ceremonies.

697
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:49,223
You'd get wasted your first day in the field
and it'd be my fault.

698
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,698
A high school girl could do my job.

699
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:53,666
I wanna get out into the shit.

700
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:56,432
I wanna get some trigger time.

701
00:48:57,342 --> 00:49:00,834
If you get killed, your mom will find me
after I rotate back to the world...

702
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:02,775
... and she'll beat the shit out of me.

703
00:49:02,947 --> 00:49:05,438
That's a negative, Rafterman.

704
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:12,145
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got anything new?

705
00:49:14,492 --> 00:49:18,155
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.

706
00:49:18,596 --> 00:49:20,086
Rear-echelon paranoia.

707
00:49:20,431 --> 00:49:24,561
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try
to pull off something big during Tet.

708
00:49:24,736 --> 00:49:27,227
They say the same thing every year.

709
00:49:27,372 --> 00:49:29,169
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

710
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,137
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

711
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:35,473
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

712
00:49:35,646 --> 00:49:39,002
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs...

713
00:49:39,183 --> 00:49:42,038
... barking at the moon
and visiting his dead relatives.

714
00:49:42,453 --> 00:49:45,809
Right. Ann-Margret
and entourage are due here next week.

715
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,255
I want someone on the airfield
and stick with her for a couple of days.

716
00:49:49,427 --> 00:49:51,918
-Rafterman, you take it.
-Aye, aye, sir.

717
00:49:52,063 --> 00:49:53,758
And get some good low-angle stuff.

718
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:57,992
Don't make it too obvious,
but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

719
00:49:58,169 --> 00:50:00,433
-Yes, sir.
-""Diplomats in dungarees.

720
00:50:00,605 --> 00:50:04,302
Marine engineers lend a helping hand
rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently....""

721
00:50:04,475 --> 00:50:07,774
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees...

722
00:50:07,945 --> 00:50:11,039
... if they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

723
00:50:11,215 --> 00:50:12,978
I'll make a note of it, sir.

724
00:50:13,651 --> 00:50:16,176
""NVA soldier deserts
after reading pamphlets.

725
00:50:16,354 --> 00:50:20,381
A young North Vietnamese Army regular,
who realized his side could not win...

726
00:50:20,558 --> 00:50:23,356
... deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets.""

727
00:50:23,528 --> 00:50:26,622
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?

728
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:30,529
Is there an irregular?
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?

729
00:50:30,701 --> 00:50:31,759
I'll fix it up, sir.

730
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:34,228
Lawrence Welk Show
is out on TV in two weeks.

731
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:35,565
Dave, do 1 00 words on it.

732
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,265
-AFTV will give you some background stuff.
-Sir.

733
00:50:38,443 --> 00:50:40,206
"" Not while we're eating.

734
00:50:40,378 --> 00:50:42,903
NVA learned Marines
on a search-and-destroy mission...

735
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,412
... don't like to be interrupted
while eating chow.""

736
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:49,474
Search-and-destroy. We have a new
directive from MAF on this.

737
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:54,248
In future, in place of search-and-destroy,
substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

738
00:50:54,425 --> 00:50:57,724
-Sweep-and-clear, got it?
-Got it. Very catchy.

739
00:50:58,563 --> 00:51:00,827
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

740
00:51:01,399 --> 00:51:02,957
Sir?

741
00:51:03,134 --> 00:51:07,059
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire,
the grunts must have hit something.

742
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:08,500
Didn't see them.

743
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,930
Joker, I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

744
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,568
Grunts who give half their pay to buy
gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

745
00:51:16,747 --> 00:51:19,011
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

746
00:51:19,183 --> 00:51:22,778
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.

747
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:26,651
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?

748
00:51:26,824 --> 00:51:28,485
It was raining, sir.

749
00:51:28,993 --> 00:51:31,826
Well, that's why God passed
the law of probability.

750
00:51:31,996 --> 00:51:35,090
Now rewrite it and give it
a happy ending. Say, one killed.

751
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:37,632
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?

752
00:51:38,135 --> 00:51:39,466
Whichever you say.

753
00:51:39,637 --> 00:51:42,128
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

754
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:45,504
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

755
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,274
Joker...

756
00:51:47,445 --> 00:51:50,835
... maybe you'd like our guys
to read the paper and feel bad.

757
00:51:51,015 --> 00:51:54,143
I mean, in case you didn't know it,
this is not a very popular war.

758
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:56,445
Now, it is our job to report the news...

759
00:51:56,621 --> 00:51:59,681
... that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

760
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:04,053
Sir, maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

761
00:52:04,228 --> 00:52:07,959
I'm sure you could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

762
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:10,557
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

763
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:12,691
Can't say I liked it much.

764
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:15,862
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

765
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,066
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong...

766
00:52:19,243 --> 00:52:21,438
... in the rear with the gear.

767
00:52:29,153 --> 00:52:31,951
Tet. The year of the monkey.

768
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:35,251
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

769
00:52:35,426 --> 00:52:40,523
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

770
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,903
I am fucking bored to death, man.

771
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:56,002
I gotta get back in the shit.

772
00:52:56,147 --> 00:52:59,241
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

773
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,416
Joker's so tough...

774
00:53:01,652 --> 00:53:05,042
... he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

775
00:53:05,222 --> 00:53:07,110
... then ask for seconds.

776
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:09,684
Listen up, pilgrim.

777
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:14,354
A day without blood is
like a day without sunshine.

778
00:53:14,832 --> 00:53:16,129
Shit.

779
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,191
Joker thinks the bad bush is between
an old mama-san's legs.

780
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:22,293
He's never been in the shit.

781
00:53:22,473 --> 00:53:25,203
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.

782
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:27,901
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.

783
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,741
-You weren't even in country.
-Eat shit and die...

784
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:33,770
... you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

785
00:53:33,951 --> 00:53:35,350
I was there, man.

786
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:37,248
I was in the shit with the grunts.

787
00:53:37,421 --> 00:53:41,209
Don't listen to
any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

788
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:44,782
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

789
00:53:45,496 --> 00:53:46,986
You listen to Joker, new guy.

790
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:48,758
He knows ti ti.

791
00:53:48,933 --> 00:53:50,457
Very little.

792
00:53:50,635 --> 00:53:53,433
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.

793
00:53:53,604 --> 00:53:57,131
-The stare?
-The thousand-yard stare.

794
00:53:57,308 --> 00:54:00,300
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit for too long.

795
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:02,002
It's like--

796
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:04,301
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

797
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:06,277
I got it.

798
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,281
All field Marines got it.

799
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:09,942
And you'll have it too.

800
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,418
I will?

801
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:13,147
Hey, Payback...

802
00:54:13,324 --> 00:54:16,418
... how do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?

803
00:54:17,028 --> 00:54:19,917
-Fuck you, Stork.
-Throw them a basketball.

804
00:54:24,935 --> 00:54:27,028
-lncoming.
-Oh, shit.

805
00:54:28,706 --> 00:54:30,594
Them are outgoing.

806
00:54:32,543 --> 00:54:34,773
-That ain't outgoing.
-That ain't outgoing.

807
00:54:34,945 --> 00:54:36,572
Now, what did I just say?

808
00:55:14,685 --> 00:55:17,916
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.

809
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:21,354
-I ain't ready for this shit.
-Amen.

810
00:56:14,278 --> 00:56:16,166
Cease fire.

811
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,378
-Cease fire.
-Cease fire.

812
00:56:26,023 --> 00:56:28,014
Cease fire.

813
00:56:39,003 --> 00:56:40,994
The enemy...

814
00:56:41,172 --> 00:56:43,663
... has very deceitfully...

815
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:46,696
... taken advantage
of the Tet ceasefire...

816
00:56:46,877 --> 00:56:50,210
... to launch an offensive
all over the country.

817
00:56:50,548 --> 00:56:54,211
So far, we 've had it pretty easy here.

818
00:56:54,385 --> 00:56:56,580
But we seem to be the exception.

819
00:56:57,321 --> 00:57:02,076
Charlie has hit every major military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

820
00:57:02,259 --> 00:57:08,118
In Saigon the United States Embassy
has been overrun by suicide squads.

821
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,221
-Shit.
-Jesus Christ, man.

822
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:13,928
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

823
00:57:15,206 --> 00:57:17,766
We also have reports
that a division of NVA...

824
00:57:17,942 --> 00:57:22,868
... has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

825
00:57:23,047 --> 00:57:26,107
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

826
00:57:26,283 --> 00:57:29,047
... the civilian press
are about to wet their pants...

827
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:34,146
... and we've heard even Cronkite's
gonna say the war is now unwinnable.

828
00:57:34,758 --> 00:57:36,487
In other words...

829
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,484
... it's a huge shit sandwich
and we're all gonna have to take a bite.

830
00:57:44,368 --> 00:57:46,131
Sir.

831
00:57:46,437 --> 00:57:49,292
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's
not coming?

832
00:57:54,111 --> 00:57:58,468
Joker, I want you
to get straight up to Phu Bai.

833
00:57:58,949 --> 00:58:02,146
Captain January will need all his people.

834
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,583
-Yes, sir.
-And, Joker...

835
00:58:04,755 --> 00:58:07,747
... you will take off that damn button.

836
00:58:07,925 --> 00:58:11,349
How's it gonna look if you get killed
wearing a peace symbol?

837
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:13,018
Sir.

838
00:58:13,163 --> 00:58:15,358
Permission to go with Joker?

839
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:18,022
-Permission granted.
-Thank you, sir.

840
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:21,126
Sir, permission not to take
Rafterman with me?

841
00:58:21,305 --> 00:58:23,398
You still here?

842
00:58:23,574 --> 00:58:27,203
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

843
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,710
You're responsible for him.

844
00:59:05,549 --> 00:59:07,176
Get some.

845
00:59:08,018 --> 00:59:09,747
Get some.

846
00:59:12,356 --> 00:59:15,245
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

847
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,991
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.

848
00:59:24,034 --> 00:59:25,626
Get some.

849
00:59:33,143 --> 00:59:35,304
Get some, baby.

850
00:59:35,646 --> 00:59:38,035
Get some. Get some. Get some.

851
00:59:39,049 --> 00:59:41,677
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.

852
00:59:41,852 --> 00:59:44,343
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

853
00:59:44,521 --> 00:59:46,716
I've got you, mother.

854
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:54,690
Anyone who runs is a VC.

855
00:59:55,265 --> 00:59:57,790
Anyone who stands still...

856
00:59:57,968 --> 01:00:00,892
... is a well-disciplined VC.

857
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,469
You guys ought to do a story
about me sometime.

858
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:10,704
Why should we do a story about you?

859
01:00:11,081 --> 01:00:13,174
Because I'm so fucking good.

860
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,477
That ain't no shit neither.

861
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:20,112
I've done got me 1 57 dead gooks killed.

862
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:23,054
And 50 water buffaloes too.

863
01:00:23,227 --> 01:00:26,025
Them are all certified.

864
01:00:26,196 --> 01:00:29,051
Any women or children?

865
01:00:29,566 --> 01:00:31,193
Sometimes.

866
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:36,033
How can you shoot women and children?

867
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,937
Easy.

868
01:00:38,108 --> 01:00:40,497
You just don't lead them so much.

869
01:00:42,046 --> 01:00:44,002
Ain't war hell?

870
01:01:20,584 --> 01:01:22,711
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

871
01:01:22,886 --> 01:01:24,376
Down the road. Two-Five.

872
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:27,319
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.

873
01:01:52,082 --> 01:01:53,709
Excuse me.

874
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:55,249
Sir.

875
01:01:55,419 --> 01:01:58,513
We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

876
01:01:58,689 --> 01:02:00,122
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

877
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,689
You people one-one?

878
01:02:01,859 --> 01:02:04,157
No, sir.
We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

879
01:02:04,328 --> 01:02:06,159
-Stars and Stripes?
-Yes, sir.

880
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,355
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

881
01:02:08,532 --> 01:02:11,330
Cowboy's just down the road
in the platoon area.

882
01:02:11,502 --> 01:02:15,165
-You mind if we tag along, sir?
-No problem. Welcome aboard.

883
01:02:15,339 --> 01:02:18,570
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

884
01:02:18,742 --> 01:02:20,972
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.

885
01:02:21,145 --> 01:02:22,635
I played ball for Notre Dame.

886
01:02:22,813 --> 01:02:24,110
-Notre Dame?
-Yeah.

887
01:02:24,281 --> 01:02:26,977
-All right.
-You here to make Cowboy famous?

888
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:28,743
Never happen, sir.

889
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:33,185
Well, if you people came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

890
01:02:33,357 --> 01:02:36,520
We got Condition Red
and we're definitely expecting rain.

891
01:02:36,693 --> 01:02:39,457
Outstanding, sir.
We taking care of business?

892
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,120
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

893
01:02:41,298 --> 01:02:43,823
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river...

894
01:02:44,001 --> 01:02:46,196
... street by street and house by house.

895
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,361
Charles definitely
got his shit together...

896
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:50,803
... but we're still getting
some decent kills here.

897
01:02:50,974 --> 01:02:55,172
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about
the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.

898
01:02:55,345 --> 01:02:56,778
That's affirmative.

899
01:02:56,947 --> 01:03:00,576
I saw some bodies about a half a klick
this side of Phu Cam Canal.

900
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:02,912
Will you show me where, sir?

901
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:06,847
Here's the canal.

902
01:03:29,846 --> 01:03:33,009
The dead have been covered with lime.

903
01:03:34,218 --> 01:03:37,073
The dead know only one thing:

904
01:03:37,754 --> 01:03:40,279
It is better to be alive.

905
01:03:46,597 --> 01:03:48,189
Excuse me?

906
01:03:48,365 --> 01:03:50,629
-Good morning, lieutenant.
-Morning.

907
01:03:50,801 --> 01:03:54,362
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

908
01:03:54,538 --> 01:03:55,971
What outfit are you men with?

909
01:03:56,139 --> 01:03:58,266
Sir, we're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

910
01:03:58,542 --> 01:04:00,066
-Oh, I see.
-I'm Sergeant Joker...

911
01:04:00,244 --> 01:04:02,542
... and this photographer is Rafterman.

912
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:05,307
I'm Lieutenant Cleves
and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

913
01:04:05,482 --> 01:04:08,406
-Have you got a body count, sir?
-We think it's 20.

914
01:04:08,585 --> 01:04:10,678
Do you know how it happened, sir?

915
01:04:11,054 --> 01:04:14,820
Well, it seems the NVA came in
with a list of gook names.

916
01:04:14,992 --> 01:04:19,554
Government officials, policemen,
ARVlN officers, school teachers.

917
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:21,721
They went around
to their houses real polite...

918
01:04:21,898 --> 01:04:25,231
... and asked them to report
the next day for political reeducation.

919
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:28,000
Everybody who turned up got shot.

920
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:29,798
Some they buried alive.

921
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,337
Ready.

922
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:34,376
Colonel.

923
01:04:35,912 --> 01:04:38,608
Marine, what is that button
on your body armor?

924
01:04:38,782 --> 01:04:40,044
A peace symbol, sir.

925
01:04:40,217 --> 01:04:42,811
-Where did you get it?
-I don't remember, sir.

926
01:04:43,253 --> 01:04:45,118
What is that written on your helmet?

927
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:46,779
Born to kill, sir.

928
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:49,948
You write born to kill on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

929
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:52,459
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?

930
01:04:52,629 --> 01:04:55,189
-No, sir.
-What is it supposed to mean?

931
01:04:55,365 --> 01:04:56,730
I don't know, sir.

932
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,390
-You don't know much.
-No, sir.

933
01:04:58,535 --> 01:05:01,800
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will take a shit on you.

934
01:05:01,972 --> 01:05:03,701
-Yes, sir.
-Now answer my question...

935
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:06,240
... or you'll be standing tall
before the man.

936
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:09,368
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

937
01:05:09,546 --> 01:05:13,141
-The what?
-The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

938
01:05:14,351 --> 01:05:16,581
-Whose side are you on, son?
-Our side, sir.

939
01:05:16,753 --> 01:05:18,380
-You love your country?
-Yes, sir.

940
01:05:18,555 --> 01:05:20,147
How about getting with the program.

941
01:05:20,324 --> 01:05:22,747
Jump on the team and come on in
for the big win.

942
01:05:22,926 --> 01:05:23,950
Yes, sir.

943
01:05:24,127 --> 01:05:28,587
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to
obey my orders as they would God's word.

944
01:05:28,765 --> 01:05:30,494
We are here to help the Vietnamese...

945
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:34,592
... because inside every gook
there is an American trying to get out.

946
01:05:34,771 --> 01:05:36,432
It's a hardball world, son.

947
01:05:36,606 --> 01:05:40,235
We've gotta try to keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

948
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:41,434
Aye, aye, sir.

949
01:05:51,888 --> 01:05:55,619
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1 st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

950
01:05:55,792 --> 01:05:57,589
Around the back.

951
01:06:06,203 --> 01:06:09,297
-First Platoon?
-Yeah, through there.

952
01:06:32,996 --> 01:06:35,055
Hey, Lone Ranger.

953
01:06:39,102 --> 01:06:42,765
-Holy shit. It's the Joker.
-You old motherfucker.

954
01:06:47,844 --> 01:06:48,833
What's happening?

955
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:52,834
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit.

956
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,874
What's happening, man?

957
01:06:55,051 --> 01:06:58,441
Oh, just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

958
01:06:58,622 --> 01:07:00,578
Yeah? Well, why go back?

959
01:07:00,757 --> 01:07:02,281
Here or there, samey-same.

960
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:04,154
-Been getting any?
-Only your sister.

961
01:07:04,327 --> 01:07:08,423
Well, better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

962
01:07:09,032 --> 01:07:11,626
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.

963
01:07:11,802 --> 01:07:14,965
This is my bro, Joker, from the lsland,
and this is...?

964
01:07:15,138 --> 01:07:17,094
-Rafterman.
-Rafterman.

965
01:07:17,274 --> 01:07:20,107
They're from Stars and Stripes.
They'll make you famous.

966
01:07:20,277 --> 01:07:21,574
-Fucking A.
-Yeah.

967
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:23,667
We're the Lusthog Squad.

968
01:07:23,847 --> 01:07:26,407
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.

969
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:30,075
We shoot them full of holes
and fill them full of lead.

970
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:37,220
You a photographer?

971
01:07:38,662 --> 01:07:41,222
No, I'm a combat correspondent.

972
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:44,723
Oh, you seen much combat?

973
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:49,837
Well, I've seen a little on TV.

974
01:07:54,177 --> 01:07:56,941
You're a real comedian.

975
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:00,945
Well, they call me the Joker.

976
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:04,710
Well, I got a joke for you.

977
01:08:04,855 --> 01:08:08,120
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.

978
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:13,193
Well, pilgrim...

979
01:08:13,363 --> 01:08:18,494
... only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit.

980
01:08:23,907 --> 01:08:26,000
You talk the talk.

981
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:30,043
Do you walk the walk?

982
01:08:34,451 --> 01:08:35,941
Now, you might not believe it...

983
01:08:36,353 --> 01:08:41,381
... but under fire, Animal Mother's one of
the finest human beings in the world.

984
01:08:41,558 --> 01:08:45,688
All he needs is somebody to throw
hand grenades at him the rest of his life.

985
01:08:45,862 --> 01:08:50,026
That's a roger, come on.
Sit down. Come on, new guy.

986
01:08:52,769 --> 01:08:55,033
Hey, jungle-bunny.

987
01:08:55,205 --> 01:08:58,003
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?

988
01:08:58,174 --> 01:09:00,005
Yeah, Mother.

989
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:03,075
Hey, photographer.

990
01:09:04,481 --> 01:09:06,506
You wanna take a good picture?

991
01:09:07,784 --> 01:09:09,217
Here, man.

992
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:11,043
Take this.

993
01:09:19,896 --> 01:09:22,751
This is my bro.

994
01:09:32,342 --> 01:09:34,435
This is his party.

995
01:09:34,611 --> 01:09:36,772
He's the guest of honor.

996
01:09:37,714 --> 01:09:40,376
Today is his birthday.

997
01:09:40,984 --> 01:09:43,782
Happy birthday, zipperhead.

998
01:09:44,788 --> 01:09:47,177
I will never forget this day.

999
01:09:47,357 --> 01:09:52,647
The day I came to Hue City
and fought 1 million NVA gooks.

1000
01:09:53,129 --> 01:09:56,428
I love the little commie bastards, man,
I really do.

1001
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,131
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

1002
01:10:02,105 --> 01:10:05,063
These are great days we're living, bros.

1003
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:10,236
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

1004
01:10:10,981 --> 01:10:13,370
These people we wasted here today...

1005
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,781
... are the finest human beings
we will ever know.

1006
01:10:18,588 --> 01:10:20,249
After we rotate back to the world...

1007
01:10:20,423 --> 01:10:23,722
... we're gonna miss not having
anyone around who's worth shooting.

1008
01:11:30,193 --> 01:11:32,855
-Stay put, keep your heads down.
-Stay put.

1009
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:34,656
Stay put.

1010
01:11:49,813 --> 01:11:51,872
Shit.

1011
01:11:59,756 --> 01:12:03,248
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1012
01:12:04,961 --> 01:12:08,624
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

1013
01:12:09,766 --> 01:12:11,131
Delta Six.

1014
01:12:11,301 --> 01:12:14,429
Delta Six, we are receiving incoming fire
from the vill.

1015
01:12:14,904 --> 01:12:16,496
The lieutenant is down.

1016
01:12:16,673 --> 01:12:19,631
We're going to stop here
and check out what's in front of us. Over.

1017
01:12:25,281 --> 01:12:27,772
Okay, Lusthog Squad, listen up.

1018
01:12:28,451 --> 01:12:30,544
Gonna move up these roads
and check the vill.

1019
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,086
I want the third team up this road here.

1020
01:12:33,256 --> 01:12:37,147
First and second fire team behind me
up this other road, okay?

1021
01:12:37,627 --> 01:12:40,482
Let's go. Let's get it done.

1022
01:17:07,108 --> 01:17:09,804
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

1023
01:17:09,977 --> 01:17:13,140
Hey, start the cameras.
This is Vietnam: The Movie.

1024
01:17:13,314 --> 01:17:15,680
Yeah, Joker can be John Wayne,
I'll be a horse.

1025
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:18,512
-T. H. E. Rock can be a rock.
-I'll be Ann-Margret.

1026
01:17:18,686 --> 01:17:20,608
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo.

1027
01:17:20,788 --> 01:17:23,279
-I'll be General Custer.
-Who'll be the lndian?

1028
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:26,484
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the lndians.

1029
01:18:04,665 --> 01:18:06,656
You're going home now.

1030
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:12,502
Semper fi.

1031
01:18:15,476 --> 01:18:18,070
We're mean Marines, sir.

1032
01:18:21,449 --> 01:18:23,576
Go easy, bros.

1033
01:18:27,722 --> 01:18:29,781
Better you than me.

1034
01:18:33,494 --> 01:18:36,156
Well, at least they died
for a good cause.

1035
01:18:36,964 --> 01:18:39,194
What cause was that?

1036
01:18:40,701 --> 01:18:42,259
Freedom.

1037
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:45,994
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

1038
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:50,563
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

1039
01:18:51,712 --> 01:18:53,907
This is a slaughter.

1040
01:18:55,149 --> 01:18:58,676
If I'm gonna get my balls
blown off for a word...

1041
01:18:59,754 --> 01:19:02,643
... my word is poon tang.

1042
01:19:05,393 --> 01:19:08,123
Tough break for Hand Job.

1043
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:12,488
He was all set
to get shipped out on a medical.

1044
01:19:14,035 --> 01:19:15,991
What was the matter with him?

1045
01:19:18,339 --> 01:19:21,536
He was jerking off 1 0 times a day.

1046
01:19:22,643 --> 01:19:26,238
It's no shit. At least 1 0 times a day.

1047
01:19:28,182 --> 01:19:33,506
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

1048
01:19:33,921 --> 01:19:37,982
The crazy fucker starts jerking off
in the waiting room.

1049
01:19:38,526 --> 01:19:41,086
Instant Section Eight.

1050
01:19:41,762 --> 01:19:45,186
He was just waiting
for his papers to clear Division.

1051
01:19:47,702 --> 01:19:50,557
You ready? Turn over.

1052
01:19:52,106 --> 01:19:54,404
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

1053
01:19:56,510 --> 01:20:00,503
Well, like-- Like you see, you know,
it's a major city...

1054
01:20:00,681 --> 01:20:04,208
... so we have to assault with tanks,
we roll in the streets.

1055
01:20:04,385 --> 01:20:06,774
So they send us in first to squat...

1056
01:20:06,954 --> 01:20:10,685
... make sure that there are no little....

1057
01:20:11,826 --> 01:20:15,057
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

1058
01:20:15,229 --> 01:20:17,720
So we clear it out
and we roll the tanks in...

1059
01:20:17,898 --> 01:20:20,230
... and basically blow the place to hell.

1060
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:24,430
When we're in Hue,
when we're in Hue City...

1061
01:20:24,605 --> 01:20:26,561
... it's like a war, you know...

1062
01:20:26,741 --> 01:20:28,629
... Iike what-- What--

1063
01:20:28,809 --> 01:20:31,801
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was--

1064
01:20:31,979 --> 01:20:34,470
You know, was supposed to be.

1065
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:37,845
There's the enemy, you kill them.

1066
01:20:38,452 --> 01:20:41,580
I don't think there's any question about it.
I mean, we're the best.

1067
01:20:41,756 --> 01:20:43,883
I mean, all that bullshit
about the Air Cav....

1068
01:20:44,058 --> 01:20:46,185
When the shit hits the fan,
who do they call?

1069
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,693
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine.

1070
01:20:49,864 --> 01:20:52,856
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

1071
01:20:53,534 --> 01:20:57,459
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

1072
01:20:57,638 --> 01:20:59,868
Can I quote LBJ?

1073
01:21:01,409 --> 01:21:04,901
""l will not send American boys...

1074
01:21:05,079 --> 01:21:07,343
...8 or 1 0,000 miles
around the world...

1075
01:21:07,515 --> 01:21:11,713
... to do a job that Asian boys
ought to be doing for themselves.""

1076
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:17,944
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war...

1077
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:21,891
... you know, I mean, like they--
It's sort of like...

1078
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:25,820
... they took away our freedom
and gave it to the gookers, you know.

1079
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,558
But they don't want it.

1080
01:21:27,735 --> 01:21:30,158
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess,
you know.

1081
01:21:30,337 --> 01:21:32,328
Poor, dumb bastards.

1082
01:21:33,207 --> 01:21:37,940
Well, the ones I'm fighting at
are some pretty-- Pretty bad boys.

1083
01:21:38,112 --> 01:21:39,875
I'm not real....

1084
01:21:41,048 --> 01:21:43,881
I'm not real keen
on some of these fellas...

1085
01:21:44,051 --> 01:21:47,475
... that are supposedly on our side.

1086
01:21:47,655 --> 01:21:50,488
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

1087
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,584
Yeah.

1088
01:21:54,161 --> 01:21:56,356
I mean, we're getting killed
for these people...

1089
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:58,691
... and they don't even appreciate it.

1090
01:21:59,366 --> 01:22:01,288
They think it's a big joke.

1091
01:22:01,936 --> 01:22:03,927
Well, if you ask me...

1092
01:22:04,405 --> 01:22:06,430
... we're shooting the wrong gooks.

1093
01:22:06,907 --> 01:22:10,434
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

1094
01:22:10,611 --> 01:22:14,172
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

1095
01:22:15,182 --> 01:22:17,946
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?

1096
01:22:18,119 --> 01:22:19,882
Well, I think we should win.

1097
01:22:20,521 --> 01:22:22,512
I hate Vietnam.

1098
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:24,715
There's not one horse
in this whole country.

1099
01:22:24,892 --> 01:22:27,019
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

1100
01:22:27,194 --> 01:22:29,788
There's something
basically wrong with that.

1101
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:33,154
Well, if they'd send us
more guys, maybe...

1102
01:22:33,334 --> 01:22:37,361
... and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

1103
01:22:38,139 --> 01:22:43,668
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam,
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

1104
01:22:44,278 --> 01:22:48,635
I wanted to meet interesting and
stimulating people of an ancient culture...

1105
01:22:48,816 --> 01:22:50,113
... and kill them.

1106
01:22:50,551 --> 01:22:55,375
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

1107
01:23:14,074 --> 01:23:16,235
Ten-hut.

1108
01:23:18,045 --> 01:23:19,569
-All right.
-My, oh, my.

1109
01:23:19,747 --> 01:23:22,636
-Good morning, little schoolgirl.
-Look at this lady.

1110
01:23:22,817 --> 01:23:24,910
I'm a little schoolboy too.

1111
01:23:25,286 --> 01:23:26,583
My, my, my.

1112
01:23:27,154 --> 01:23:30,453
-What you got there, chief?
-Do you want number one fucky?

1113
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:34,458
Hey, any of you boys
want number one fucky?

1114
01:23:34,628 --> 01:23:37,017
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.

1115
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,395
-Me want sucky.
-Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.

1116
01:23:40,568 --> 01:23:43,128
She give you everything you want,
long time.

1117
01:23:43,337 --> 01:23:47,262
Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?

1118
01:23:47,441 --> 01:23:49,705
-Fifteen dollars each.
-No.

1119
01:23:52,046 --> 01:23:54,708
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.

1120
01:23:54,882 --> 01:23:56,144
Five dollar each.

1121
01:23:56,317 --> 01:23:58,114
Come on, she love you good.

1122
01:23:58,285 --> 01:23:59,809
Boom-boom long time.

1123
01:23:59,987 --> 01:24:01,682
-Ten dollars.
-Five dollars.

1124
01:24:01,856 --> 01:24:03,346
No. Ten dollars.

1125
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:05,685
Be glad to trade you some ARVlN rifles.

1126
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:08,693
Ain't never been fired
and only dropped once.

1127
01:24:09,597 --> 01:24:11,360
Okay, $5. You give me.

1128
01:24:11,532 --> 01:24:13,864
-Okay, okay.
-All right.

1129
01:24:15,135 --> 01:24:16,500
Let's get mounted.

1130
01:24:21,909 --> 01:24:23,467
Something wrong there, chief?

1131
01:24:23,644 --> 01:24:25,600
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

1132
01:24:25,779 --> 01:24:27,337
What the motherfuck?

1133
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:30,039
She says soul brother too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

1134
01:24:30,217 --> 01:24:31,548
What is this, man?

1135
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:36,782
I think what he's trying to tell you
is you black boys pack too much meat.

1136
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:40,487
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1137
01:24:40,661 --> 01:24:42,322
Oh, shit.

1138
01:24:42,496 --> 01:24:46,193
This baby-san looks like she could
suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

1139
01:24:46,367 --> 01:24:49,427
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

1140
01:24:49,603 --> 01:24:51,525
Excuse me, ma'am.

1141
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:54,230
What we have here, little yellow sister...

1142
01:24:54,408 --> 01:24:58,833
... is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

1143
01:24:59,046 --> 01:25:01,606
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

1144
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:04,572
Okay, okay.

1145
01:25:05,286 --> 01:25:07,242
Okay, okay.

1146
01:25:08,589 --> 01:25:10,853
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.

1147
01:25:11,025 --> 01:25:13,220
-Hey, we need a batting order.
-I'm going first.

1148
01:25:13,394 --> 01:25:16,784
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

1149
01:25:16,964 --> 01:25:20,263
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

1150
01:25:20,434 --> 01:25:23,562
-Hey, Animal, man.
-You son of a--

1151
01:25:23,737 --> 01:25:27,867
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

1152
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:30,340
-I don't want it after you, man.
-Fuck you.

1153
01:26:03,544 --> 01:26:05,842
Intelligence passed the word down...

1154
01:26:06,013 --> 01:26:09,574
... that during the night
the NVA had pulled out of our area...

1155
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:12,708
... to positions across the Perfume River.

1156
01:26:12,886 --> 01:26:17,277
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

1157
01:26:48,756 --> 01:26:51,520
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.

1158
01:27:05,005 --> 01:27:06,529
Shit.

1159
01:27:15,115 --> 01:27:17,003
He ain't gonna make it.

1160
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,547
Shit.

1161
01:27:28,062 --> 01:27:31,327
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1162
01:27:32,766 --> 01:27:36,258
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

1163
01:27:37,137 --> 01:27:38,627
Hotel One. Over.

1164
01:27:38,806 --> 01:27:40,831
Murph, this is Cowboy.

1165
01:27:41,008 --> 01:27:44,341
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

1166
01:27:45,546 --> 01:27:47,241
Wait, One.

1167
01:27:48,415 --> 01:27:52,875
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.

1168
01:27:53,187 --> 01:27:54,779
-Continue with the patrol...
-Shit.

1169
01:27:54,955 --> 01:27:57,253
-... and call in at the next checkpoint.
-Shit.

1170
01:27:57,424 --> 01:28:00,154
Roger. Out.

1171
01:28:06,567 --> 01:28:08,432
I ' m squad leader.

1172
01:28:11,438 --> 01:28:13,827
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

1173
01:28:14,942 --> 01:28:16,500
All right.

1174
01:28:17,311 --> 01:28:18,869
He's dead.

1175
01:28:59,987 --> 01:29:01,511
Cowboy.

1176
01:29:08,328 --> 01:29:09,590
What's up?

1177
01:29:09,863 --> 01:29:13,094
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

1178
01:29:13,267 --> 01:29:15,656
Here, see what you think.

1179
01:29:17,771 --> 01:29:20,797
I think we're here...

1180
01:29:21,341 --> 01:29:24,265
... and we should be here.

1181
01:29:25,879 --> 01:29:28,006
-We're here?
-Yeah.

1182
01:29:28,182 --> 01:29:31,447
-We should be here?
-Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1183
01:29:37,591 --> 01:29:39,320
Fuck.

1184
01:29:44,665 --> 01:29:46,292
What do you think?

1185
01:29:47,935 --> 01:29:50,699
Well, I think we should change direction.

1186
01:30:04,651 --> 01:30:06,209
Okay.

1187
01:30:06,853 --> 01:30:08,878
We'll change direction.

1188
01:30:19,533 --> 01:30:21,091
What's up?

1189
01:30:21,268 --> 01:30:23,190
Changing direction.

1190
01:30:23,904 --> 01:30:25,132
What are we, lost?

1191
01:30:25,305 --> 01:30:28,399
Joker, shut the fuck up.

1192
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:30,836
Okay, listen up.

1193
01:30:31,011 --> 01:30:33,104
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

1194
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,111
Okay, we're changing direction.

1195
01:30:35,282 --> 01:30:37,011
We're heading over that way.

1196
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:40,381
Eightball's gonna go over there
and see can he find a way through.

1197
01:30:40,887 --> 01:30:43,276
-Got it?
-Got it.

1198
01:30:43,991 --> 01:30:46,983
Eightball, let's dance.

1199
01:30:47,561 --> 01:30:49,859
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

1200
01:31:50,957 --> 01:31:52,481
Fuck.

1201
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:09,607
Cease fire.

1202
01:32:09,776 --> 01:32:11,664
Cease fire, goddamn it.

1203
01:32:11,845 --> 01:32:14,370
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.

1204
01:32:14,548 --> 01:32:16,072
-Hold it.
-Cease fire.

1205
01:32:16,249 --> 01:32:17,477
-Cease fire.
-Cease fire.

1206
01:32:17,651 --> 01:32:21,178
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

1207
01:32:21,355 --> 01:32:23,016
Anybody see a sniper?

1208
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:24,680
-Nothing.
-Negative.

1209
01:32:24,858 --> 01:32:28,749
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

1210
01:32:29,696 --> 01:32:30,856
Eightball.

1211
01:32:31,031 --> 01:32:33,625
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

1212
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,495
Animal, cease fire.

1213
01:32:35,669 --> 01:32:37,796
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

1214
01:32:37,971 --> 01:32:39,461
This is Cowboy. Over.

1215
01:32:39,606 --> 01:32:43,064
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.

1216
01:32:43,243 --> 01:32:45,541
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.

1217
01:32:45,712 --> 01:32:46,974
Eightball is down.

1218
01:32:47,147 --> 01:32:50,036
Our position is about half a klick
north of Checkpoint Four.

1219
01:32:50,217 --> 01:32:53,914
Believe possible strong enemy forces
occupying buildings in front of us.

1220
01:32:54,087 --> 01:32:57,579
Request immediate tank support. Over.

1221
01:32:58,091 --> 01:32:59,490
Roger. Understand.

1222
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:02,150
I'll see what I can do. Over.

1223
01:33:02,329 --> 01:33:04,695
Roger. Over and out.

1224
01:33:04,865 --> 01:33:07,163
-Stay close.
-Got it.

1225
01:33:07,801 --> 01:33:11,828
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.

1226
01:33:12,005 --> 01:33:15,566
I think there may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings over there.

1227
01:33:15,742 --> 01:33:17,607
I've requested tank support.

1228
01:33:17,778 --> 01:33:21,043
We're gonna sit tight till it comes,
but keep your eyes open.

1229
01:33:21,214 --> 01:33:25,241
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

1230
01:33:26,286 --> 01:33:29,016
Goddamn it. Halt.
Cease your fire, Mother.

1231
01:33:29,189 --> 01:33:31,077
-Cease your fucking fire.
-Cowboy.

1232
01:33:31,258 --> 01:33:33,021
-What?
-We can't leave him out there.

1233
01:33:33,193 --> 01:33:35,957
We're not leaving him,
we'll get him when the tank comes up.

1234
01:33:36,129 --> 01:33:38,791
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

1235
01:33:38,965 --> 01:33:40,990
I seen this before.

1236
01:33:41,168 --> 01:33:44,399
That sniper's just trying to suck us in,
one at a time.

1237
01:33:46,273 --> 01:33:49,436
Goddamn it. No.

1238
01:33:49,609 --> 01:33:52,533
-Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
-Man, fuck this--

1239
01:33:52,712 --> 01:33:54,805
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.

1240
01:33:54,981 --> 01:33:58,542
-No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
-Cover me.

1241
01:34:14,468 --> 01:34:18,962
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

1242
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:21,403
Cease fire.

1243
01:34:32,786 --> 01:34:34,083
Hold your fire.

1244
01:34:34,254 --> 01:34:36,279
Hold your fire.

1245
01:34:36,456 --> 01:34:38,947
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.

1246
01:34:39,125 --> 01:34:43,482
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.

1247
01:34:48,935 --> 01:34:50,732
Hold your fire.

1248
01:34:51,438 --> 01:34:53,929
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

1249
01:34:55,175 --> 01:34:57,166
Give me that fucking radio.

1250
01:35:01,381 --> 01:35:03,975
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

1251
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:05,640
This is Murphy. Over.

1252
01:35:05,785 --> 01:35:08,151
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.

1253
01:35:08,355 --> 01:35:11,244
What's the story
on that fucking tank? Over.

1254
01:35:12,325 --> 01:35:15,783
Sorry, Cowboy.
No luck so far with the tank.

1255
01:35:15,962 --> 01:35:18,226
Will advise. Over.

1256
01:35:19,232 --> 01:35:21,188
Roger. Out.

1257
01:35:21,601 --> 01:35:23,899
Numb-nut bastards.

1258
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:27,164
-Okay, listen up.
-Listen up.

1259
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:30,100
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

1260
01:35:30,277 --> 01:35:32,199
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.

1261
01:35:32,379 --> 01:35:34,574
When they do,
we won't have time to pull out.

1262
01:35:34,748 --> 01:35:37,706
We gotta do it now.
Let's get ready to move.

1263
01:35:37,884 --> 01:35:40,148
-Ready to pull out.
-Wait a minute. Hold it.

1264
01:35:40,554 --> 01:35:44,342
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.

1265
01:35:44,524 --> 01:35:45,786
Back off, Mother.

1266
01:35:45,959 --> 01:35:48,917
I'm calling the plays.
I say we're pulling out.

1267
01:35:49,095 --> 01:35:50,892
Well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?

1268
01:35:51,064 --> 01:35:54,852
I know it's a shitty thing to do,
but we can't refuse to accept the situation.

1269
01:35:55,035 --> 01:35:57,299
We're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.

1270
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:59,301
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1271
01:35:59,472 --> 01:36:02,202
-You know that.
-Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

1272
01:36:02,375 --> 01:36:04,866
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

1273
01:36:05,011 --> 01:36:07,377
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.

1274
01:36:11,585 --> 01:36:15,715
Fuck you, Cowboy.
Fuck all you assholes.

1275
01:36:17,824 --> 01:36:20,850
-Goddamn it.
-Fucking son of a bitch.

1276
01:36:21,027 --> 01:36:23,723
You motherfucker.

1277
01:36:39,379 --> 01:36:42,109
Doc. Doc. Doc.

1278
01:36:43,950 --> 01:36:45,872
Where's the sniper?

1279
01:36:48,855 --> 01:36:52,018
Doc, where's the sniper?

1280
01:37:00,734 --> 01:37:02,463
Shit.

1281
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:06,595
Shit. Fuck.

1282
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,512
Fuck.

1283
01:37:54,187 --> 01:37:56,314
Hey, Cowboy.

1284
01:37:56,656 --> 01:37:58,419
Yeah?

1285
01:37:59,292 --> 01:38:02,784
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

1286
01:38:03,396 --> 01:38:06,888
There's only one sniper, nothing else.

1287
01:38:07,267 --> 01:38:11,124
Move up the squad,
you're clear up to here.

1288
01:38:11,971 --> 01:38:13,461
Come on.

1289
01:38:16,076 --> 01:38:18,271
Son of a bitch.

1290
01:38:22,048 --> 01:38:24,608
-Okay, listen up.
-Listen up.

1291
01:38:25,652 --> 01:38:29,884
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
you come with me, we'll take a look.

1292
01:38:30,323 --> 01:38:32,712
The rest of you all stay put
and cover our ass.

1293
01:38:32,892 --> 01:38:35,690
We may be coming back in a big hurry.

1294
01:38:36,563 --> 01:38:38,895
-I'm going with you.
-I'm coming too.

1295
01:38:39,065 --> 01:38:40,896
Okay.

1296
01:38:41,067 --> 01:38:42,728
-You all set?
-Yeah.

1297
01:38:42,902 --> 01:38:43,926
Let's move out.

1298
01:38:44,304 --> 01:38:45,362
Let's do it.

1299
01:39:23,576 --> 01:39:24,907
Hey, Cowboy.

1300
01:39:25,078 --> 01:39:27,569
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

1301
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:50,029
Donlon, give me that radio.

1302
01:39:52,572 --> 01:39:54,301
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

1303
01:40:04,818 --> 01:40:07,207
-Cowboy.
-Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.

1304
01:40:07,387 --> 01:40:09,275
Get him the fuck out of here.

1305
01:40:15,995 --> 01:40:18,691
-I ain't got a first aid.
-I don't believe this shit.

1306
01:40:18,865 --> 01:40:20,992
-Give me your hand.
-Shut up.

1307
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:22,759
-Take it easy, Cowboy.
-Don't move.

1308
01:40:22,936 --> 01:40:24,233
-Shit.
-That son of a bitch.

1309
01:40:24,404 --> 01:40:26,269
-You'll be all right.
-You're going home.

1310
01:40:26,439 --> 01:40:29,272
-Shut up.
-Don't shit me.

1311
01:40:29,442 --> 01:40:33,071
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.

1312
01:40:33,713 --> 01:40:34,907
Come on. Easy.

1313
01:40:35,315 --> 01:40:36,441
Here you go.

1314
01:40:38,151 --> 01:40:42,042
-Cowboy.
-Hang on, man. Hang on.

1315
01:40:45,892 --> 01:40:48,918
I can hack it. I can hack it.

1316
01:40:55,001 --> 01:40:58,425
-I can hack it.
-You can hack it, man.

1317
01:41:54,494 --> 01:41:57,054
Let's go get some payback.

1318
01:42:02,969 --> 01:42:04,561
Okay.

1319
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:12,439
Okay.

1320
01:42:19,886 --> 01:42:21,979
Watch that fucking hole.

1321
01:42:23,256 --> 01:42:24,484
Throw some smoke.

1322
01:42:41,007 --> 01:42:42,804
Okay, ready?

1323
01:43:23,816 --> 01:43:27,547
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

1324
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:35,287
Joker, in there. New guy.

1325
01:45:39,285 --> 01:45:42,209
We got the sniper.

1326
01:46:15,922 --> 01:46:17,446
Joker?

1327
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:19,480
Yo.

1328
01:46:19,825 --> 01:46:21,383
What's up?

1329
01:46:22,862 --> 01:46:25,023
We got the sniper.

1330
01:46:37,577 --> 01:46:39,533
I saved Joker's ass.

1331
01:46:39,712 --> 01:46:41,509
I got the sniper.

1332
01:46:41,681 --> 01:46:44,343
I fucking blew her away.

1333
01:46:45,184 --> 01:46:47,140
Am I bad?

1334
01:46:47,753 --> 01:46:51,746
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heartbreaker?

1335
01:47:09,308 --> 01:47:11,469
What's she saying?

1336
01:47:15,114 --> 01:47:16,945
She's praying.

1337
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:24,119
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

1338
01:47:27,026 --> 01:47:29,449
There's nothing we can do for her.

1339
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:33,123
She's dead meat.

1340
01:47:37,603 --> 01:47:39,036
Okay.

1341
01:47:40,339 --> 01:47:42,500
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1342
01:47:47,013 --> 01:47:48,878
What about her?

1343
01:47:52,652 --> 01:47:54,313
Fuck her.

1344
01:47:55,655 --> 01:47:57,350
Let her rot.

1345
01:48:13,673 --> 01:48:16,005
We can't just leave her here.

1346
01:48:19,211 --> 01:48:21,099
Hey, asshole.

1347
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,810
Cowboy's wasted.

1348
01:48:24,283 --> 01:48:26,843
You're fresh out of friends.

1349
01:48:27,953 --> 01:48:29,784
I'm running this squad now...

1350
01:48:29,955 --> 01:48:34,221
... and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

1351
01:48:38,064 --> 01:48:41,124
I'm not trying to run this squad.

1352
01:48:42,968 --> 01:48:46,927
I'm just saying
we can't leave her like this.

1353
01:48:56,449 --> 01:48:59,407
Shoot me.

1354
01:49:01,354 --> 01:49:03,379
Shoot...

1355
01:49:03,889 --> 01:49:05,481
... me.

1356
01:49:06,058 --> 01:49:08,151
Shoot...

1357
01:49:08,661 --> 01:49:10,253
... me.

1358
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:12,721
Shoot.

1359
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,095
Shoot.

1360
01:49:17,303 --> 01:49:20,602
If you wanna waste her, go on...

1361
01:49:22,475 --> 01:49:24,568
... waste her.

1362
01:49:24,744 --> 01:49:26,371
Shoot...

1363
01:49:28,547 --> 01:49:29,980
... me.

1364
01:49:34,086 --> 01:49:36,850
Shoot me.

1365
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:40,019
Shoot...

1366
01:49:41,293 --> 01:49:43,022
... me.

1367
01:49:43,396 --> 01:49:45,489
Shoot...

1368
01:49:46,198 --> 01:49:47,631
... me.

1369
01:49:48,234 --> 01:49:50,429
Shoot.

1370
01:49:52,071 --> 01:49:54,096
Shoot.

1371
01:49:57,743 --> 01:49:59,267
Shoot.

1372
01:50:00,279 --> 01:50:01,871
Shoot.

1373
01:50:39,185 --> 01:50:41,016
Joker...

1374
01:50:41,187 --> 01:50:45,942
... we're gonna have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

1375
01:50:49,728 --> 01:50:51,855
Hard-core, man.

1376
01:50:53,866 --> 01:50:56,391
Fucking hard-core.

1377
01:51:13,385 --> 01:51:18,448
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

1378
01:51:19,058 --> 01:51:23,722
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

1379
01:52:02,268 --> 01:52:06,466
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

1380
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:12,771
... about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming-fuck fantasy.

1381
01:52:13,412 --> 01:52:16,108
I am so happy that I am alive...

1382
01:52:16,282 --> 01:52:19,809
... in one piece and short.

1383
01:52:20,486 --> 01:52:23,785
I am in a world of shit, yes...

1384
01:52:23,956 --> 01:52:25,912
... but I am alive.

1385
01:52:26,325 --> 01:52:28,316
And I am not afraid.
