1
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,717
Before the end
of the season last year...

2
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,596
...and then re-injured it
in spring training...

3
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,265
...on a terrific game-saving play.

4
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,476
You know, I was talking with...

5
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,521
- What time is this going on?
- 7:30 is the pre-game.

6
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,733
- Who'd you say was pitching?
- Tiant's pitching.

7
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,945
- Goddamn Cuban. He can hurl it.
- I'd hate to be facing him.

8
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,157
- Who are they playing, Yankees?
- Yankees.

9
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,993
Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball
coming at you.

10
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,912
- You don't have time to think.
- Hey, guys!

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,498
What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

12
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,833
He's been hot lately.

13
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:30,214
He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.

14
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,553
Ah!

15
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,312
Save.

16
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,730
The sewer.

17
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,240
Hold on, I'll get it.

18
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:01,036
Sorry, guys, I guess I don't
know my own strength.

19
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,873
You know what, Dave? That must be it.

20
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,297
Hey...

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,717
...you guys know what
would be really cool?

22
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,512
- What?
- Driving a car.

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,764
You know, just around the block.

24
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,724
Yeah?

25
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,395
Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

26
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,315
I steal a car, my dad will kill me.

27
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,360
Just around the block. Who said steal?

28
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,750
Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

29
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,480
See, now it'll be there forever.

30
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,109
Me too.

31
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,280
Forever.

32
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,952
Let me ask you something.

33
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,585
You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

34
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,712
Huh?

35
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,174
Come here.

36
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,969
Get over here.

37
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,484
Well, do you?

38
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,820
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

39
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,448
- No.
- No, what?

40
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,619
Sir.

41
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,497
You're the hard case of the group, huh?

42
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,377
A pack of punks, huh?

43
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,674
You live around here?

44
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,009
Right there.

45
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,890
You?

46
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,059
Right over there.

47
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,188
How about you?
Where do you live, son?

48
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,568
- Rester Street.
- Is your mother home?

49
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:50,372
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

50
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,048
Get in.

51
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,553
Get the fuck inside.

52
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,279
In.

53
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,037
You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

54
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,588
And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

55
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,285
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

56
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,412
The cop. He had a gold badge.

57
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,624
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

58
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,126
- No, no writing.
- He had a uniform on?

59
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,961
Like a regular police uniform?

60
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,297
- He was a cop.
- He took Davey.

61
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,468
- So, what were you guys doing?
- We wrote our names in the cement...

62
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,180
You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

63
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,934
- That doesn't make sense. Come on.
- Is there something wrong, Dad?

64
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,163
Please.

65
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,249
No more.

66
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,168
Please.

67
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,672
No more, please.

68
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,370
- Have you seen him?
- Looks like damaged goods to me.

69
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,456
Jesus.

70
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,076
You took some good swings today.

71
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,662
Dad, I struck out.

72
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,458
Good swings, though.
That's what counts.

73
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,128
I'll never be a good ballplayer.

74
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,925
Hey, you're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

75
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,721
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.

76
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,557
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

77
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,436
Hey.

78
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,773
- See that gutter drain over there?
- Yeah.

79
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,069
I used to play on this street
when I was a kid.

80
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,572
That drain swallowed every ball we had.

81
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,201
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

82
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,329
If we could get that manhole cover up...

83
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,456
...could be 1000 balls down there.

84
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,793
Really? Let's try.

85
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,240
Get in.

86
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,243
Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

87
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:43,498
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

88
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,305
Jimmy. Jimmy.

89
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,558
Earth to Mr. Markum.

90
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,312
- What do you want now, Pete?
- Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?

91
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,356
We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

92
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,400
- So?
- So that means less profit...

93
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,695
...and more profit means I get a raise.

94
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,405
So why don't you order more.

95
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,867
All right, but if the
Surgeon General calls, you're my alibi.

96
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,800
- Hey, you.
- Hey, there.

97
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,054
I'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

98
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:43,183
Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

99
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,728
- Christ, I sound like...
- Someone's father?

100
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,230
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

101
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,736
- Later, Daddy.
- Later.

102
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,613
Have fun.

103
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,579
- Later.
- Later.

104
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,732
Brendan.

105
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,946
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.

106
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,784
He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

107
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,122
What will he do if he sees this?

108
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,834
Shoot you and then kill you.

109
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,674
It's been six hours.

110
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,301
I had to see you.

111
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,098
I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

112
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,185
Tomorrow?

113
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,479
Like we planned?

114
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,107
Tomorrow.

115
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,363
Drop me around the corner.

116
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,689
- Take it easy.
- He kept cutting me off!

117
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:59,110
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

118
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,364
He followed me all the way from
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

119
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,908
That son of a bitch!

120
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,369
Oh, can you believe this guy
keeps confessing?

121
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:12,707
I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab a
lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

122
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,544
Hey, Devine?

123
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,344
- What you looking at?
- The old neighborhood.

124
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,559
- We're done, but I can stay.
- No, I think we're good, thanks.

125
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,356
Um, a few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

126
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,486
No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

127
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,863
Yeah.

128
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,743
- So the wife left you six months ago?
- So?

129
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,205
So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs...

130
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,333
This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

131
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,918
So, what's your point?

132
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,797
The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

133
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,466
She wants to worship
at the temple of Sean Devine.

134
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,761
- I'm married, Whitey.
- So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

135
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,514
You haven't talked to Lauren
in six months.

136
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,140
She calls all the time.

137
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,435
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.

138
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:18,481
One of these days, the phone's gonna
ring and she'll tell me why she left.

139
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,943
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

140
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,007
Come on, come on, come on.

141
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,761
The pitch. A swing and
a line drive into right field. A base hit.

142
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,973
I just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

143
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,901
Could we please have three beers?

144
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,784
Yeah, come on.

145
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,759
You believe those chicks?

146
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,264
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

147
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,559
Hey.

148
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,062
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

149
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,774
- We've got you right over here, boys.
- Yeah.

150
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,734
Yeah.

151
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,696
I've known her since she was a kid.

152
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,042
A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.

153
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,594
Dave.

154
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,681
It's 3 in the morning.

155
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,099
Where have you been?

156
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,895
Oh, my God.

157
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,606
I fucked up.

158
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,733
What happened?

159
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,738
This guy tried to mug me,
and I swung on him and he sliced me.

160
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,701
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

161
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,246
No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.

162
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:42,250
- It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
- Oh, my God, Dave.

163
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,712
Come on. Come here.

164
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,010
So I'm walking to my car, and this
guy comes up to me, he asks for a light.

165
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,388
I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

166
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,142
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

167
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,769
- Oh, God.
- That's when I see the knife.

168
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,064
Says, "Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them."

169
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,774
- That's what he said?
- Yeah.

170
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,278
So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

171
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:15,241
- You said you swung on him first.
- Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?

172
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,161
I'm sorry, babe.

173
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,663
Shh.

174
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,542
I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I...

175
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,629
I went off.

176
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,300
I bashed his head on the parking lot.

177
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,970
There was blood everywhere.

178
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,433
I might have killed him.

179
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,312
Killed him?

180
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,655
It makes you feel...

181
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,200
...alone, you know, hurting somebody.

182
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,121
Yeah, but you had to, right?

183
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,166
It makes you feel...

184
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,835
...alien.

185
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,303
Okay.

186
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,306
Babe, you hop in the shower.

187
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,060
And I'll take care of your clothes.

188
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,397
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

189
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,399
Here.

190
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,706
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

191
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,377
There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

192
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,296
- What's the location of the car?
- Sydney Street.

193
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,384
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend just found it.

194
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,220
- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.

195
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,930
Your name, what's your name?

196
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,724
We're so fucking out of here.
Good luck, man.

197
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,156
Dispatch, this is Unit 33.

198
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:23,411
We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,
and you might want to notify Homicide.

199
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,456
Thirty-three, have you
found a body yet? Over.

200
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,586
No, but by the looks
of this car, we'll find one sooner or later.

201
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,185
- Yeah?
- I'm in the weeds at the store...

202
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,728
...and I need some help.

203
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,648
You and Katie can't handle 6,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

204
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,485
- That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
- Hold on.

205
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,538
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

206
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,459
Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 10.

207
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,295
No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

208
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,838
She'll be there.

209
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,633
You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

210
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,011
Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

211
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,347
You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

212
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,476
I'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

213
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,645
What the fuck's going on here?

214
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,157
- Pete, anybody show?
- No.

215
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,326
Katie didn't call?

216
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,245
No.

217
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,882
- Hello?
- Drew, Jimmy.

218
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,176
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.

219
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,305
Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

220
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,519
Have a nice day.

221
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,772
No, it was Diane Cestra
who slept over. No Katie.

222
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,985
Eve said she dropped her off at around
1:00. Didn't say where she was going.

223
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,861
Don't worry, I'll track her down.

224
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,865
- She seeing anybody maybe?
- 19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?

225
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,244
- That's the cold truth, bud.
- I'll talk to you later.

226
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,379
I'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

227
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,257
- Mind if I go grab a smoke?
- You can smoke the whole pack.

228
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,967
Thanks.

229
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,064
Can I help you, Brendan?

230
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,485
No, Mr. Markum, I'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

231
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,947
- That's Barry's. Next aisle.
- Thanks.

232
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,464
- When's Sal getting here?
- Anytime now.

233
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,592
- That it, Bren?
- A Globe.

234
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,721
I thought Katie worked on Sundays.

235
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,932
Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

236
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,019
No, I just see her here sometimes.

237
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,980
Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

238
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,315
Oh.

239
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,901
Thanks. Come on, Ray.

240
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,499
Can I ask you something, Jimmy?

241
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,126
Shoot.

242
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,462
Why do you hate that kid so bad?

243
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,966
It's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

244
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,303
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

245
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,557
He's nice. Does sign language with his
brother even though he doesn't have to.

246
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,643
He doesn't want him to feel alone.

247
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,979
But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away...

248
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,816
...from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

249
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,194
- No. Really?
- Straight up.

250
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,826
Here's Sal. About fucking time.

251
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,676
- Hey, there, bad boy.
- Sarge.

252
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:53,597
This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

253
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,142
So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

254
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,188
How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

255
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,648
Let's go find out.

256
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,234
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER
on his own...

257
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,778
...steak knife sticking out
of his collarbone.

258
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,198
He asks the nurse, "Hey, where they
keep the Coke machine?"

259
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,743
- Did she tell him?
- What do we got on the car so far?

260
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,581
We found the registration in the
glove box. Owner is Katherine Markum.

261
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,291
- Oh, shit.
- You know her?

262
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,043
Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy I know.

263
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,922
We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 19.

264
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,051
- Oh, fuck, that's her.
- Is it a problem? You close with the guy?

265
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,556
When we were kids. Now it's just
a "hello" around the neighborhood.

266
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,560
Nineteen.

267
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,520
Fuck, man.

268
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,273
He's in for a world of hurt.

269
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,053
Do not make her laugh.

270
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,188
Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

271
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,651
Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel...

272
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:33,113
...around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

273
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,324
Okay, perp stood outside the car...

274
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,452
...girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off...

275
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,622
...hits her in the shoulder,
maybe the bicep.

276
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,000
She runs for it
through the trampled weeds...

277
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,880
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I dig that.

278
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,092
Body of Christ.

279
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,428
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

280
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,724
My God, Jimmy, our baby.

281
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,481
Body of Christ.

282
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:14,154
Body of Christ.

283
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,243
So I'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

284
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,869
The killer shows, she bolts.

285
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:24,623
She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

286
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,043
Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

287
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,177
Body of Christ.

288
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,599
Body of Christ.

289
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,154
So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

290
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,366
No, I haven't seen him since we
were kids. Once in a while, I run into him.

291
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,202
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

292
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:06,332
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

293
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,042
This dress itches.

294
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,879
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

295
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,381
We are so proud of you.

296
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,736
- Morning, honey.
- Dave.

297
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:40,074
There's nothing about it in the papers.
I checked three times.

298
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,410
It was late, real late.

299
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,790
- Morning, Mikey.
- Morning, Dad.

300
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,586
- You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

301
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,923
Come on.

302
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,928
Put your coat on, Mike.

303
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,222
Thanks, Mom.

304
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,902
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What's up, Ed?

305
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,780
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

306
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:24,159
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

307
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,121
- Nadine's First Communion.
- What are you doing here?

308
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,832
Just curious, I guess.

309
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:48,434
That's my daughter's car.

310
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,022
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

311
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,941
- Want to take a walk over?
- Yeah.

312
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,277
- Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, go ahead.

313
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,779
We got a guy on Sydney
says he's the father.

314
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,406
Oh, shit.

315
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,117
- Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
- En route.

316
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,162
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

317
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,832
Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.

318
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,751
And he's got some guys with him.

319
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,212
- What guys?
- Crazy-looking guys.

320
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,884
- The Savage brothers.
- Just a "hi" around the neighborhood?

321
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,886
All right, I'm on my way.

322
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,350
- Hey, guys.
- That's our niece in there.

323
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,186
- Let us in.
- We're doing our job.

324
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,645
- Let us in.
- Fuck you!

325
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,522
The doughnut shop's that way!

326
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,484
- Nick, Val, ease up.
- Fucking dickhead.

327
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,694
- Enough.
- Nick.

328
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:45,032
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

329
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,785
- Kevin, let's go.
- And, guys?

330
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,580
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

331
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,874
- But get answers.
- You got it.

332
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,256
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

333
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,427
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

334
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,222
- Is she in there?
- All we're doing is looking.

335
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,017
- Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
- That's my daughter's car.

336
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,270
- I understand.
- And it's got blood in it.

337
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:19,733
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

338
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:24,571
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

339
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,990
- Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, say again.

340
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,118
Sergeant Powers says you need
to get in here ASAP.

341
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:34,081
- Your location?
- The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.

342
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,083
All right.

343
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,252
Make sure he doesn't get through.

344
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,879
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

345
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:45,008
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

346
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,969
Go.

347
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,852
There's a massive search underway
for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.

348
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,688
All we know now
is there are signs of foul play...

349
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,774
...in a car found abandoned
outside of Pen Park.

350
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,279
Now, police officers have moved in
quickly and cordoned off the area...

351
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,782
...but even as we speak,
a crowd of spectators has gathered.

352
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,244
We don't know more than that,
but we will stay on the story.

353
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:17,791
Until later, this is Jim Smith
reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.

354
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,669
Ready? Bat back.

355
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,549
All the way back.

356
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,271
I never saw anything like that before.

357
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,815
What do we got?

358
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,493
Oh, Christ.

359
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,473
Is that her?

360
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,727
Yeah.

361
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,981
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

362
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,567
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

363
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,612
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

364
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,200
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a.38.

365
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,870
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

366
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,081
"Hey, Jimmy...

367
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:43,251
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect."

368
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,382
- Hey.
- Hold on!

369
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,844
- Grab him. Stop that guy.
- Hey, you!

370
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,263
- I'm fucking going in there!
- Take it easy!

371
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,766
- Get his arms.
- Hold him. Come on.

372
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,268
- Let me in, you motherfuckers!
- Take it easy.

373
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:05,357
- Let me in!
- Is she in there?!

374
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:10,404
- Sean, is my daughter in there?!
- Let me in! You motherfuckers!

375
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:14,074
Is my daughter in there?!
Is she in there?! Is she in there?!

376
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,451
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

377
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,080
Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

378
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,250
Is that my daughter in there?!

379
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,586
Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

380
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:31,299
- Get off me!
- Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

381
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,261
Is that my daughter in there?

382
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,806
No! No!

383
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,103
Oh, no!

384
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,772
No, God!

385
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,359
Oh, God, no!

386
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,822
No one's said anything, right?

387
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,657
What do you mean?

388
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:42,370
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

389
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,498
Jimmy?

390
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,291
- Jimmy, please...
- Please what?

391
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,170
- Please...
- Please what, baby? Please what?

392
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,796
Yeah, that's her.

393
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,341
That's Katie.

394
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,928
That's my daughter.

395
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,033
Fresh-brewed.

396
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,661
So we need to work a time line.

397
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,164
It's details, little things
that make a case.

398
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,084
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

399
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,007
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

400
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,093
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

401
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,346
At the last minute,
she changed her mind.

402
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,725
See what I mean?

403
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,436
What do you mean, Jimmy?

404
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:35,108
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

405
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,152
- What car?
- You're losing me here.

406
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,613
If I'd gotten into that car that day...

407
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,616
...my life would have been
a different thing.

408
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:46,620
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

409
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,748
...she was a beautiful woman.

410
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,167
Regal.

411
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,587
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

412
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,256
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

413
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,594
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

414
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,513
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

415
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,475
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

416
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,686
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

417
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:15,023
And Katie never would have been born.

418
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,318
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

419
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,489
- See?
- Yeah.

420
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:28,620
- You ever see Dave around?
- He married my cousin Celeste.

421
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:35,585
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

422
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,254
Around 7:30.

423
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,382
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

424
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:47,180
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

425
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,392
She was having dinner with her friends.

426
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,856
- Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
- Yeah.

427
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,860
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

428
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,531
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

429
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,075
And then around 8, she left.

430
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,370
- Do you know who she talked to?
- No.

431
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,291
Do you mind if we have the phone
company subpoenaed for records?

432
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,710
- No, go ahead.
- Good.

433
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:21,256
You spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

434
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,509
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

435
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,721
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

436
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,141
No, she was herself,
she was happy. She...

437
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,101
She what?

438
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,396
It's nothing.

439
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,733
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

440
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,987
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

441
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,824
...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

442
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,244
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

443
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,623
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

444
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,753
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

445
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,589
- Okay.
- It was just a look.

446
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:07,969
It's information. We collect it, put it
together, see what fits. Little things.

447
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,429
You were in prison?

448
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,889
- Oh, Jesus.
- Here we go.

449
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,391
- Whitey.
- I'm just asking.

450
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,771
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

451
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,774
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

452
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,778
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

453
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,239
- Sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

454
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,700
Okay, Mr. Markum.

455
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,371
- Okay.
- Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

456
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,000
...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

457
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,385
There was this kid.

458
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,012
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

459
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,306
What? Remember, it's the little things.

460
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,894
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

461
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,855
- Barely knew each other.
- Could they have been dating?

462
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,816
- No.
- What makes you so sure?

463
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,527
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

464
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,488
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

465
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,950
No one right now, as far as we know.

466
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:15,203
- I mean, knew.
- I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

467
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,665
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

468
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:23,461
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

469
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,966
And if you think of anything...

470
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,803
...anything at all, give us a call.

471
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,103
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

472
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:44,190
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

473
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,234
This car came up and took Dave away.

474
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,237
- Abduction?
- Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

475
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:53,658
Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

476
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,660
- They catch these guys?
- One died.

477
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,705
The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

478
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,876
Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

479
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,212
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

480
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,132
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

481
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,678
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

482
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,603
the gunshot wound
to the back of the head...

483
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,730
...not the trauma from the beating.

484
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,315
What else?

485
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,067
Her and her friends were barhopping.

486
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:31,279
We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

487
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,073
One other thing,
the backpack in her car...

488
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,243
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

489
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,704
It doesn't sound like much.

490
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,081
What do you say, Devine?

491
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,502
We'll get the guy, sir.

492
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,797
That's right. All right, let's do it.

493
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,722
- That's the best you can come up with?
- It made him happy, didn't it?

494
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,727
This is Sean.

495
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,898
- Hello?
- Is it Lauren?

496
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,487
You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.

497
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,658
Is he with you?

498
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,375
Is that the baby?

499
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,920
Christ, Lauren, at least tell me her name.

500
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,432
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

501
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,990
Hey.

502
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,787
Would it surprise you?

503
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,872
Wouldn't be the first time.

504
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:11,004
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that...?

505
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,172
Did you see her?

506
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,676
- I heard a car hit something.
- Hit what? Another car?

507
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,721
- Oh, no, not loud like that.
- Like hitting the curb?

508
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,764
Yes, maybe.

509
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,892
Then it stalled, and someone said, "Hi."

510
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,186
- Someone said, "Hi"?
- "Hi."

511
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,857
Then there was a loud crack.

512
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,736
- Could it have been a gunshot?
- Yes, maybe.

513
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:38,281
- Did you look out your window?
- Oh, no.

514
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,409
I was in my dressing gown by then.

515
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,038
I don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

516
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,874
The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

517
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,501
Female.

518
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,045
I think.

519
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,965
- It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
- Yeah.

520
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,384
Sorry to trouble you.

521
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,853
- Jimmy.
- Theo.

522
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,356
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

523
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,524
- She's trying.
- Let's get these on ice.

524
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,069
You got a couple of coolers?

525
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,243
Right here's fine.

526
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,794
So how are you handling all this so far?

527
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,922
- It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
- Yeah?

528
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,508
It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

529
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,428
When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months...

530
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:46,391
...but my kids were
all grown up. I had that luxury.

531
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:50,269
You, you got domestic responsibilities.

532
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,273
Domestic responsibilities?

533
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:59,737
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

534
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,907
Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

535
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,660
It just needed to be said, that's all.

536
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,914
You'll come through
because you're a man.

537
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,250
Like I said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

538
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,670
I said, "You got yourself
a real old-school man there."

539
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,464
- Like they put her in a bag.
- What?

540
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,843
That's what Katie looked like
when I saw her in the morgue.

541
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,972
Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

542
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,809
- Well...
- Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

543
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,146
She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

544
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,192
- You don't need to talk about Janey.
- My daughter was murdered.

545
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,029
They put a gun to her. As we
stand here, she's on an autopsy slab...

546
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,991
...getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders...

547
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:48,828
...and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

548
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,876
Good to see you, Theo.

549
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,508
Eve, just tell them what they
want to know.

550
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,636
- Who was she dating?
- We already told the Savages.

551
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,556
- The Savage brothers?
- They were here yesterday.

552
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,101
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

553
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,562
No one special.

554
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,194
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

555
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,322
- What?
- She was leaving town, wasn't she?

556
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,867
- Going to Las Vegas?
- How do you know?

557
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:32,872
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

558
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:37,043
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

559
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,713
Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

560
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,758
So who was she going with?

561
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:48,012
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

562
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,181
Brendan.

563
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,558
Excuse me?

564
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:56,103
- Brendan.
- Brendan Harris?

565
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,731
Brendan Harris, yeah.

566
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,733
You got an address?

567
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,207
Hey, Dave.

568
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,004
Hey, Jimmy.

569
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,633
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

570
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:29,345
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

571
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,937
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

572
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:43,109
How you doing?

573
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,529
What happened to your hand?

574
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,031
This?

575
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:54,287
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

576
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,124
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

577
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,128
It's good to see you.

578
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,255
Yeah?

579
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,471
How are our girls holding up?

580
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,765
They're doing okay, I guess.

581
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:18,269
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

582
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,951
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

583
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,538
Yeah.

584
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:46,505
I couldn't stand looking through the
fridge to find room for all that food...

585
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,634
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

586
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,137
- Lot of waste, huh?
- Yeah.

587
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:58,768
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

588
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:03,856
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

589
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,532
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

590
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,827
...that girl was neat.

591
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,749
When I got out of the joint...

592
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:26,045
...you know, after Marita died...

593
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:32,551
...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

594
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,389
...than I ever was of being in prison.

595
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,066
I loved her...

596
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,277
...most...

597
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,450
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

598
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:05,459
...it was like we were the last two
people on Earth. You know, forgotten.

599
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,254
Unwanted.

600
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,719
And it's really starting to piss me off,
Dave, because I can't cry for her.

601
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:18,973
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

602
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,730
Jimmy.

603
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,736
You're crying now.

604
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,116
Yeah, damn.

605
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,124
I just want to hug her one more time.

606
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,548
She was 19 fucking years old.

607
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,807
Do you want me to leave you alone?

608
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,352
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

609
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:10,149
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

610
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,794
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

611
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,547
- You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
- She isn't hurt. She's dead.

612
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:40,513
- I didn't kill her.
- Again, when's the last time you saw her?

613
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,018
About 8...
Saturday night, about 8:00.

614
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,312
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

615
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,856
It was about 8. Um...

616
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:56,862
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

617
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,533
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

618
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,744
I don't know.

619
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:09,375
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

620
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:13,462
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

621
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,131
He's not a thief.

622
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,925
He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

623
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,263
Daughter probably had the same bad
gene. You count yourself lucky, Bren.

624
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:27,560
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

625
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,730
We were gonna leave Sunday.

626
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,860
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

627
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,447
Well, that was the plan, right?

628
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,617
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

629
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,912
- Ma, I was gonna tell you.
- Just like your father, huh?

630
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,090
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

631
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,634
- Hey, boys.
- Hey.

632
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,595
He don't speak.

633
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:07,099
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

634
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:11,395
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

635
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:16,901
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, Brendan?

636
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,986
I was asleep.

637
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,946
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

638
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,912
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

639
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,873
He came down for breakfast at 9.

640
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:36,337
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

641
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:40,674
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take a
polygraph. You think you're up for that?

642
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,888
I loved her so much.

643
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,684
I'm never gonna feel that again.

644
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,646
It doesn't happen twice.

645
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,108
Doesn't happen once most times.

646
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,487
Celeste.

647
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:06,659
- Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
- What are you still doing here?

648
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,827
Uh...

649
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,121
I don't know.

650
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,917
I don't know, I just...

651
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,962
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

652
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,839
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

653
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:24,009
- Could I get one of those?
- Yeah.

654
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,642
One for the road and then home.

655
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:40,693
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

656
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,695
You've done enough.

657
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,201
To you and Dave for being here for this.

658
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,722
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

659
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,976
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

660
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,811
Good night.

661
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,398
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

662
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,502
Hello?

663
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:47,301
Oh, Christ. Lauren, say something.

664
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,268
"Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?"

665
00:55:56,978 --> 00:56:00,731
Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing
things made sense.

666
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,150
I'm tired of caring about
some dead girl...

667
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:06,070
...and there's just gonna be
another one after her.

668
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:11,700
Sending killers to jail is sending them
where they've been heading all their lives.

669
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,911
The dead are still dead.

670
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,874
Jesus, I...

671
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,168
...can't do this tonight.

672
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,253
I just...

673
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,090
I can't do it.

674
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,258
Bye, baby.

675
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,562
Because...

676
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:45,192
...sometimes the man
wasn't a man at all.

677
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,111
He was the boy.

678
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:51,073
The boy who escaped from wolves.

679
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,743
An animal of the dusk.

680
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,912
Invisible.

681
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,206
Silent.

682
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,875
Living in a world...

683
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,461
...the others never saw.

684
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,841
World of fireflies.

685
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:14,888
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

686
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:20,018
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

687
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:36,410
I just gotta get my head right.

688
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,583
Catch a nice, long sleep.

689
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,044
And the boy will go back to his forest.

690
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,216
Back to his fireflies.

691
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,225
Is he asleep?

692
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,249
How's Jimmy and everybody?

693
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,044
Okay.

694
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,087
It's weird.

695
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,467
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

696
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,094
Dave? Dave.

697
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,308
There's still nothing in the paper.

698
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:45,896
About what?

699
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:52,861
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

700
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,906
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

701
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,619
Yeah.

702
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,329
Right.

703
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,251
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

704
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,629
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

705
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,508
That seems more important right now.

706
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:47,499
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

707
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:51,003
But I don't know how.

708
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,691
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

709
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,527
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

710
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,029
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

711
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:21,199
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

712
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,036
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

713
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,955
Considering the crime, maybe.

714
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,540
Dave Boyle?

715
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:32,169
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

716
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,879
Could be.

717
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:37,549
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

718
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:41,428
- Clam up for no reason, huh?
- We'll see.

719
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,316
Hey, Boyle!

720
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,444
- What's it been, seven, eight years?
- Yeah.

721
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,112
Yeah. How you doing?

722
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,739
This is my son, Michael.

723
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,283
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

724
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,785
I'm an old buddy of your dad's.

725
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,328
- Hi.
- Hi.

726
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:10,248
- So you still with the staties?
- Homicide. This is my partner.

727
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,126
- Sergeant Powers. How are you?
- So you got a minute?

728
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:17,589
- We'd love to ask some quick questions.
- I was gonna walk Michael to school.

729
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:21,677
- I can be back in a few minutes.
- We'll walk with you, okay?

730
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,345
Sure.

731
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,723
So you look good.

732
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,268
- I hear rents are rising.
- Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

733
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:33,063
They're cutting my dad's
old house up into condos.

734
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,023
We walked by there the other day.

735
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,442
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

736
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,028
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

737
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,322
"Neighborhood needs
a fucking crime wave.

738
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,658
Get property values where they belong."

739
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:49,329
Girls keep getting murdered up in
Pen Park you might get your wish.

740
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,998
Dave. Call me Dave.

741
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,126
You said the F-word, Dad.

742
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,295
Yeah, I know.
Walk on up ahead, Michael.

743
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:00,632
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

744
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,803
- So, what's up, Sean?
- Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

745
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,889
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

746
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,183
- Who's Celeste?
- My wife.

747
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:14,604
- How's Jimmy doing?
- It's hard to tell. You know him.

748
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:18,150
- Yeah, so the reason we came by...
- Listen, I saw her.

749
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:23,363
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

750
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,532
That's what we wanted to talk about.

751
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,661
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

752
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,122
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

753
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,834
- Pretty drunk, huh?
- But it was harmless.

754
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,045
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

755
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,797
What time did they leave?

756
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:44,009
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

757
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,304
- So we'll say 12:45?
- Sounds about right.

758
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,974
You see anything unusual
or anyone...?

759
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,809
Michael.

760
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,020
Like what?
I don't know.

761
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,521
A guy watching the girls?

762
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,524
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

763
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,530
No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

764
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,073
See you later, Dad.

765
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,034
- You got your milk money?
- Uh-huh.

766
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,043
Fuck, I hated school.

767
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,086
What?

768
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,338
Oh, uh...

769
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,591
Yeah, me too, Sean.

770
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:30,263
Uh, just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

771
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:33,558
- Home.
- 15, would you say?

772
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,520
- Roughly. Sure.
- All right.

773
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,274
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

774
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:44,903
- Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
- All right.

775
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,161
What?

776
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,914
What happened to him in that car?

777
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,090
Can you believe this?

778
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,260
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

779
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:10,220
Yeah, well...

780
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:14,307
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

781
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:16,393
...you're not left with a whole lot.

782
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,145
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

783
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:23,525
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

784
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,652
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

785
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,072
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

786
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,869
She turns to the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

787
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:37,914
- She says, "Hi." He shoots her.
- She slams the door into him, takes off.

788
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:40,750
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

789
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:43,545
- I don't know. Something in the street.
- Maybe.

790
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,965
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

791
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:51,428
- Hits hard enough to get a jump on him?
- Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

792
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:55,140
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

793
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,518
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second, how
did we get to Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

794
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,396
- We just got to him.
- He's a guy who was in the bar.

795
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,399
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

796
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,693
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

797
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:10,530
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

798
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,866
Just a little one.

799
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:22,125
I'd recommend two sets of
visiting hours, from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

800
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,461
- Sure.
- Good.

801
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:30,800
- Have you thought about flowers?
- I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

802
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,469
Good.

803
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,768
And the notice?

804
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:41,978
Notice?

805
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:48,234
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

806
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,987
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

807
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,864
Where's my daughter?

808
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,410
Downstairs, in the basement.

809
01:05:58,245 --> 01:05:59,537
I wanna see her.

810
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:49,254
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

811
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,758
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

812
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,761
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

813
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,268
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

814
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,648
The notice.

815
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,318
"Katherine Markum...

816
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:17,490
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

817
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:22,495
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to..."

818
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,291
"Sister to Sara and Nadine."

819
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:10,710
- You guys again?
- Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

820
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,963
- You dropping in on Jimmy?
- Yeah.

821
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,883
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

822
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:20,053
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

823
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,847
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes.

824
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,849
I'm gonna go get some.
See you in a minute.

825
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:28,853
By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

826
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:35,318
Uh, garbage disposal. It jammed,
I stuck my hand in, it started again.

827
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:37,195
- Stupid.
- Yeah, painful.

828
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,868
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

829
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:48,039
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

830
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,681
- Heard you could use one.
- Thanks.

831
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:10,395
- I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
- Whatever you need right now.

832
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,107
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

833
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:22,448
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

834
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:25,285
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

835
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:26,619
- Sure?
- Celeste Boyle?

836
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,246
Uh, yeah.

837
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:31,833
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

838
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,044
- Mrs. Boyle.
- Nice to meet you.

839
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,713
Look, I gotta go.

840
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,384
- Oh, damn it.
- What?

841
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,303
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

842
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,055
- You better go get it.
- Yeah.

843
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,349
Come on.

844
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,941
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

845
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,903
- Me?
- What time did Dave get home Saturday?

846
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,696
- What?
- It's a little thing.

847
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:05,617
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

848
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,827
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

849
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,581
You think Dave killed Katie?

850
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,293
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

851
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:21,132
- I don't know.
- No. It's just that we could figure out...

852
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,886
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

853
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:28,223
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

854
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,851
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

855
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:35,355
- I was asleep.
- Huh?

856
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:41,694
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

857
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,197
Okay. Well, thanks.

858
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,668
Bullshit.

859
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,336
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

860
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:02,173
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

861
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,050
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

862
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:05,843
Remember what you said?

863
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:10,848
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

864
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:16,312
- Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
- No.

865
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,064
You're 100 percent sure?

866
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:23,027
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

867
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:28,950
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

868
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,536
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

869
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:35,373
He said Katie told him you'd disown
her if she ever dated a Harris.

870
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,211
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

871
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,713
Why is that?

872
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:46,384
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

873
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:50,722
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
"Psycho Ray" Dorian.

874
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,892
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray."

875
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,895
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

876
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:03,568
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

877
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,737
I don't know.

878
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,906
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

879
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:14,245
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any daughter of mine.

880
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:19,208
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

881
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,919
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses...

882
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:24,255
...canvassed people
who were in the bar.

883
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:28,426
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned...

884
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:32,096
...before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

885
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:35,558
- So?
- So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

886
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:39,479
- Some people don't talk to policemen.
- With all due respect...

887
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:42,148
...and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

888
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,318
- How long?
- How long what?

889
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:48,112
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

890
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,614
You bargaining with us?

891
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,742
Bargaining?

892
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,287
You giving us a deadline?

893
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:03,127
We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum.
If that's okay with you.

894
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,883
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.

895
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:16,641
The last thing we need is Markum and
the Savages putting the fear of God...

896
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,852
...into the neighborhood.
- We grew up terrified of those brothers.

897
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:23,648
Eleven months apart, like their mother
ran a loose-cannon factory.

898
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,275
Fucking knuckleheads.

899
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,406
Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.

900
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:34,951
- Yeah, you got a match?
- Mm-hm. You're gonna love it.

901
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,497
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a.38 Smith.

902
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:43,960
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in New Hampshire in 1982.

903
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:49,257
The gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

904
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,800
- In Buckingham.
- The Flats?

905
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:55,596
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

906
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:59,851
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

907
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:03,646
- That's where the bullet got pulled.
- Nice work.

908
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:05,982
Thought you'd like that.

909
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,597
It's okay, Ray.

910
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,224
Don't worry about it.

911
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,573
Ma said that?

912
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,410
That I'm better off?

913
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:08,252
I loved her! You know what that's like?

914
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:09,921
Huh?

915
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:16,928
I'm sorry.

916
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,854
No, you're wrong.

917
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,274
I won't ever feel that again.

918
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:36,239
Right there. Went in through a bottle
of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.

919
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:40,284
- Scary, huh?
- Scarier than a glass of milk, right?

920
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:42,995
So take me through it.
These two guys come in...

921
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:47,041
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.

922
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,921
- That's the storeroom.
- Uh-huh.

923
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:56,634
There's a door back there
that leads to a loading dock.

924
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:59,136
I always keep that door locked.

925
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:02,807
So they must have had a key.

926
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:06,978
A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

927
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:11,440
It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

928
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:16,320
The only reason they fired that warning
shot was they must have known...

929
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,489
...I kept this under the counter.

930
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:22,285
- And you told the police that at the time.
- Yeah.

931
01:16:23,203 --> 01:16:25,746
Sure, they went through
my employment records.

932
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,499
Questioned everybody
who used to work for me.

933
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,752
- Never made an arrest.
- Still have a copy of those records?

934
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,841
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.

935
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,509
Oh, yeah?

936
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,387
- This guy I fired a couple of weeks before.
- Mm-hm.

937
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:45,474
Son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery.

938
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:49,854
He had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face.

939
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:52,106
And I just knew.

940
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,026
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?

941
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,528
You remember his name?

942
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,489
Do I look senile to you?

943
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,159
- No, sir.
- Name...

944
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,369
...was Ray Harris.

945
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,789
We used to call him "Just Ray."

946
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:14,587
You say they used the same gun
for another crime?

947
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:19,300
- That's correct, sir.
- Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.

948
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,105
Where you been?

949
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:36,108
Out.

950
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,364
What you watching?

951
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:43,616
Some vampire movie.

952
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,911
Guy just got his head torn off.

953
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,831
Where'd you go, Celeste?

954
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,421
I was sitting in my car...

955
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:01,050
...down by the channel.
You know...

956
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,094
...thinking about things.

957
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:08,307
- What'd you think about?
- Oh, you know...

958
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:11,727
No, actually, I don't know.

959
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:20,778
Things. You know, the day.

960
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,241
About Katie being dead.

961
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:28,661
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy,
you know...

962
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,247
...those things.

963
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,624
Those things.

964
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:36,836
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

965
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:40,005
Vampires.

966
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:42,967
What about them?

967
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,972
They're undead...

968
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,225
...but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

969
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,937
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like...

970
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,981
...to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

971
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,651
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

972
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,362
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

973
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,656
You're not making any sense.

974
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:10,453
You think I killed Katie?

975
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,747
- Celeste.
- What...?

976
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:17,168
- That the sense we're making these days?
- Where'd you come up with that?

977
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:20,713
You've barely looked at me since you
found out Katie was dead.

978
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,631
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

979
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:24,550
- Dave!
- What?

980
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:29,472
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

981
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,432
Even your friend Sean
asked about...

982
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,684
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

983
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:38,522
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

984
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:42,485
- What'd you tell him?
- I said I was asleep.

985
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:46,614
- That's good thinking, baby.
- Jesus Christ, Dave!

986
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,700
- Why not tell them about the mugger?
- The mugger?

987
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,495
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

988
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:55,873
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

989
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:57,708
I must have killed her, right?

990
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,835
Fuck!

991
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,114
Henry...

992
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,243
What? Henry?

993
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:36,997
Henry and George.

994
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,920
I never told anyone that before.

995
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,257
Those were their names.

996
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,427
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

997
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:56,600
At least that's what they called
themselves, but...

998
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:01,313
...they were wolves, and Dave...

999
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:06,026
...was the boy who escaped
from wolves.

1000
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:10,406
What are you talking about, Dave?

1001
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,325
I'm talking Henry and George.

1002
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:17,121
They took me on a four-day ride.

1003
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:23,168
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

1004
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,922
And, man, Celeste...

1005
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,841
...did they have their fun.

1006
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:34,179
And no one came to help old Dave then.

1007
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:40,978
Dave had to pretend to be
somebody else.

1008
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,611
You mean, all those years ago...

1009
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,908
...when you were a little boy?

1010
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,202
Dave...

1011
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:59,455
Dave's dead.

1012
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,960
I don't know who came out of that
cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

1013
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,755
You see, honey...

1014
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,423
Fuck!

1015
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:12,301
It's like vampires.

1016
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,348
Once it's in you...

1017
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,684
...it stays.

1018
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,104
What stays?

1019
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,989
Did you know there were
child prostitutes in Rome Basin?

1020
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:36,325
What?

1021
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,624
Fuck!

1022
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:49,880
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

1023
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,049
I'm warning you...

1024
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,719
...I can't trust my mind.

1025
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:02,101
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

1026
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:13,862
Okay.

1027
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:19,451
- The gun sends us in a different direction.
- I don't see it that way.

1028
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:22,204
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

1029
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:24,164
These things get passed around.

1030
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,292
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

1031
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,379
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

1032
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:34,633
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

1033
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:39,263
They're hiding something, but Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

1034
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:43,600
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

1035
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:47,938
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper,
this guy should be in jail already.

1036
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:50,441
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

1037
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:53,986
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

1038
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:58,157
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

1039
01:23:58,324 --> 01:23:59,616
Hey, he's not my friend.

1040
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:04,288
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

1041
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,512
Hey, Jimmy.

1042
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,307
You're out late.

1043
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,184
Yeah, you too.

1044
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,437
It's cold, huh?

1045
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:30,939
Yeah, I guess.

1046
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:39,990
You know, I...

1047
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,534
I been sitting out here...

1048
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:44,828
...over the last few years...

1049
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:50,834
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

1050
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:56,840
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna sit on the porch for a while."

1051
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:03,222
Weird thing is...

1052
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,183
...it seemed to bring her back.

1053
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:12,731
I saw her, you know.

1054
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:16,235
Saw who?

1055
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,571
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

1056
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:25,702
- You saw Katie Saturday night?
- Never got around to telling you.

1057
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:30,374
Did you talk to her?

1058
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,710
Just nodded hello at one point.

1059
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:37,047
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

1060
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:44,763
But, uh...

1061
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:46,515
...Jimmy...

1062
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,893
...she looked, um...

1063
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,729
...happy.

1064
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:12,916
Uh, I got more walking to do.
Good night.

1065
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:28,056
- You stole his car.
- His car was officially towed.

1066
01:26:28,224 --> 01:26:32,060
- From the front of his house.
- No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

1067
01:26:32,228 --> 01:26:33,729
...adjacent to the parkway.

1068
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:38,442
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

1069
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:42,196
...they took it for a joy ride...
- What? Why'd you do it?

1070
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:47,284
After I left last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

1071
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:52,247
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

1072
01:26:52,415 --> 01:26:55,125
- Blood?
- Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

1073
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:59,129
- How much?
- A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot.

1074
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:02,132
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

1075
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,052
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

1076
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,971
She was chased through the park
where she died.

1077
01:27:08,139 --> 01:27:11,975
- It's enough to ask questions.
- Your search is gonna get tossed out.

1078
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:17,022
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

1079
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:21,318
- In the best interest of the owner.
- Get a physical search, file the report.

1080
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:22,986
Bingo.

1081
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:26,323
So, you wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

1082
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:29,660
- Dave's here?
- I've had him in the box for an hour.

1083
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:32,955
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

1084
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:35,999
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

1085
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:39,378
We know you didn't get that swollen
hand sticking it in the garbage disposal.

1086
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:44,800
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Why's your wife afraid of you?

1087
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:47,844
She know what really happened
to your hand?

1088
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:57,020
How about a Sprite or something?

1089
01:27:57,188 --> 01:28:01,233
How about you tell us what really
happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

1090
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:02,943
You lied.

1091
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,654
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

1092
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:10,701
- Hey, you think this is funny?
- No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

1093
01:28:10,868 --> 01:28:15,330
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

1094
01:28:15,498 --> 01:28:17,082
Okay.

1095
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:20,252
All right.

1096
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:23,880
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

1097
01:28:24,048 --> 01:28:26,717
- What blood?
- Let's start with the front seat.

1098
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,637
What are you looking at him for?

1099
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:35,767
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

1100
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:38,061
Sure.

1101
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:40,355
Oh, I get it.

1102
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,816
You're the good cop.

1103
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,361
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

1104
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:49,740
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

1105
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:54,119
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

1106
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:59,791
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

1107
01:29:02,545 --> 01:29:05,672
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

1108
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,051
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

1109
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:13,847
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

1110
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:16,683
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

1111
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:20,062
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

1112
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:22,022
Bled like hell.

1113
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,692
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

1114
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:29,446
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

1115
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:31,323
What blood type are you?

1116
01:29:31,991 --> 01:29:33,658
B-negative.

1117
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:36,620
Yeah? That's the match we got.

1118
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:39,289
- Well, there you go.
- Not quite.

1119
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,958
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

1120
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:46,129
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

1121
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:49,966
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

1122
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:53,303
- None.
- This is not the way you wanna go.

1123
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:55,180
How will that look in court?

1124
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:59,267
You not knowing how someone else's
blood got in the trunk of your car?

1125
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:02,354
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

1126
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:04,648
What report?

1127
01:30:05,024 --> 01:30:09,319
The stolen-car report. The car
wasn't in my possession last night.

1128
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,739
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

1129
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:15,492
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

1130
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:25,001
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

1131
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:28,797
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

1132
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:31,633
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

1133
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:34,386
- I can break him.
- He just kicked our asses!

1134
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:36,721
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly...

1135
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:39,182
- Is that the point? No.
- What is the point?

1136
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:43,353
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

1137
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:46,022
Okay. Maybe.

1138
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,193
So, what do we do with Dave?

1139
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:53,405
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

1140
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:58,201
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

1141
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:01,705
Or this lovely red marble here.

1142
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,374
Or a figural.

1143
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,126
That one.

1144
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:10,130
Very good. Nice and simple.

1145
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:20,223
Hey, Jimmy!

1146
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:25,812
Annabeth said you were here.

1147
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:29,274
We been asking around, like you said to.

1148
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:30,984
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1149
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:34,279
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

1150
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:36,698
And it ain't about me
missing your brains running things.

1151
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:37,908
I know.

1152
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:42,204
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

1153
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:44,915
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

1154
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:51,087
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

1155
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:54,716
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

1156
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:58,762
- The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
- What about Just Ray's kid?

1157
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,807
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

1158
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:06,269
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

1159
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:09,105
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

1160
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:13,610
- Want us to take a run at him?
- No.

1161
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:17,447
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

1162
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:21,743
What?

1163
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:27,582
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

1164
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,292
Tell him.

1165
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,964
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

1166
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:37,842
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

1167
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,845
I heard something else this morning too.

1168
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:45,684
- Two staties came by in uniform.
- Maybe forgot to ask him something.

1169
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:49,062
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

1170
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:52,315
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

1171
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:11,585
"Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6, 1957.

1172
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:14,379
First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983."

1173
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:19,175
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

1174
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:21,678
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

1175
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:26,016
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

1176
01:33:26,183 --> 01:33:31,104
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned in
another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...

1177
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:33,523
...released on lack of evidence again.

1178
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:36,401
- Beginning to become known, though.
- He's getting popular.

1179
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:40,780
Ooh. "A known associate,
one Edmund Reese, fingers Raymond...

1180
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:44,534
...in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection."

1181
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:46,202
Comic books? You go, Ray.

1182
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:49,039
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.

1183
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:50,957
Oh, excuse me.

1184
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:55,045
"Raymond returned said literature
unharmed." Does a year solid inside.

1185
01:33:55,212 --> 01:33:56,546
Ooh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1186
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:59,215
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

1187
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:01,217
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

1188
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:03,928
Mm, evidently not.

1189
01:34:04,096 --> 01:34:08,433
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBI sting operation...

1190
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:13,063
...trafficking stolen goods across state
lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

1191
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:16,066
- The boy's got style.
- Got a boatload of grief too.

1192
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:20,904
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

1193
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:25,909
- Hence, the federal interstate rap.
- Hence, they got him by the balls, but...

1194
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:27,744
...he does no time.

1195
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:31,956
- He rolled on someone.
- Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

1196
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:36,419
- August 1989, poof, he disappears.
- One, dead, two, in Witness Protection.

1197
01:34:36,587 --> 01:34:39,881
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up...

1198
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:43,635
...to murder his son's 19-year-old
girlfriend? We got nothing.

1199
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:48,431
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years
ago, during which the weapon was used.

1200
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:52,435
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

1201
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,480
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

1202
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:58,274
Let's take a look.
"Known criminal associates:

1203
01:34:58,442 --> 01:35:03,279
Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin
'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...

1204
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,115
...Anthony Waxman."

1205
01:35:05,324 --> 01:35:07,492
Ah...

1206
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,994
And one James Markum.

1207
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:14,624
And the hits just keep on coming.

1208
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:21,965
- You looking for me?
- I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

1209
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:24,217
I already gotta get back.

1210
01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:27,804
So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

1211
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:31,474
- Bunch of them.
- You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

1212
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:36,146
He stole a truckload of cigarettes from
a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

1213
01:35:36,355 --> 01:35:39,399
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

1214
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,901
I think we pulled him over
in New Bedford.

1215
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:43,111
But Harris walked.

1216
01:35:43,612 --> 01:35:45,613
He didn't walk, he rolled.

1217
01:35:45,781 --> 01:35:49,993
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

1218
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,745
On who?

1219
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:54,539
What the fuck was the name?

1220
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:58,668
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

1221
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,628
Jimmy Markum.

1222
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:05,800
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

1223
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:08,845
So did Harris ever testify in open court?

1224
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:12,599
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with...

1225
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:16,519
...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

1226
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:18,897
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

1227
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:22,609
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

1228
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:26,404
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months...

1229
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:29,532
...after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

1230
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,367
What's that tell you?

1231
01:36:42,713 --> 01:36:45,381
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

1232
01:36:45,549 --> 01:36:48,384
- Hey, coz, how you doing?
- I'm good.

1233
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:51,221
Okay. Hey.

1234
01:36:51,388 --> 01:36:53,932
- Hey, Celeste.
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

1235
01:36:54,099 --> 01:36:57,894
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1236
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:02,565
Step into my office.

1237
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:16,204
Beautiful day, huh?

1238
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:26,381
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

1239
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,722
I took Michael last night...

1240
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,975
...and I went to a motel.

1241
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,436
Okay.

1242
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:43,356
I don't know, Jim.

1243
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:46,776
I might have left Dave for good.

1244
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:50,154
You left Dave?

1245
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:54,909
Yeah.

1246
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,620
Well...

1247
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:02,500
...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

1248
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:07,005
I'm almost afraid of him.

1249
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,011
Do you know something?

1250
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:19,142
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

1251
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:21,728
He saw Katie the night
she was murdered.

1252
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:25,148
Didn't tell me about it
till after the cops questioned him.

1253
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:29,485
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

1254
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:32,655
Is there anything else I should know?

1255
01:38:40,497 --> 01:38:42,081
Come here.

1256
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:46,210
Okay.

1257
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:49,589
At 3 in the morning...

1258
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:55,345
...on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone's blood.

1259
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:01,184
What did he say happened?

1260
01:39:02,811 --> 01:39:06,314
That he was mugged.
That he...

1261
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:09,275
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

1262
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:10,693
That...

1263
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:13,196
That he might have killed him.

1264
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:22,914
But there was nothing in the paper.

1265
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:38,972
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1266
01:39:39,139 --> 01:39:40,640
Celeste?

1267
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:47,522
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

1268
01:39:52,569 --> 01:39:54,570
Okay. All right.

1269
01:39:54,738 --> 01:39:56,239
Okay.

1270
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:59,075
Oh, God.

1271
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:06,791
Okay.

1272
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:11,421
Oh, my God.

1273
01:40:12,631 --> 01:40:15,633
- Tell me about your father.
- What?

1274
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:19,762
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

1275
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:23,808
- I was 6 when he left us.
- So you don't remember the guy?

1276
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:27,145
I remember little things.

1277
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:30,648
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

1278
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:32,775
He...

1279
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:34,986
He what?

1280
01:40:35,946 --> 01:40:40,450
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

1281
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:43,119
You could always hear him
coming home.

1282
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:48,541
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

1283
01:40:49,418 --> 01:40:51,794
You remember your father having a gun?

1284
01:40:52,337 --> 01:40:53,796
No.

1285
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:58,426
Well, you seem awfully sure for
somebody who was 6 when he left.

1286
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:00,720
What's up?

1287
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:03,723
- What's that?
- This is what you asked for.

1288
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:08,478
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint
analysis, the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

1289
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:10,313
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

1290
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:13,649
We were talking about your father's gun.

1291
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:20,031
- I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
- Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

1292
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:23,785
- So when was the last time you talked?
- Never.

1293
01:41:23,994 --> 01:41:25,286
Never?

1294
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:27,747
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

1295
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:31,417
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

1296
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:33,294
Because he's not missing.

1297
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:36,339
- He sends money every month.
- Sends money?

1298
01:41:36,965 --> 01:41:40,927
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

1299
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:45,139
- From where?
- Postmark says Brooklyn.

1300
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:49,352
- How do you know it's him?
- Who else would it be?

1301
01:41:52,147 --> 01:41:54,190
Who else would send it?

1302
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:57,443
My ma says that's the way he was.

1303
01:41:57,611 --> 01:42:00,530
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

1304
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:07,036
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

1305
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:10,414
You know why, kid.

1306
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,250
No, I don't.

1307
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:15,044
The gun that killed your girlfriend...

1308
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:18,089
...was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

1309
01:42:19,007 --> 01:42:20,258
So...

1310
01:42:20,884 --> 01:42:22,885
...you wanna tell me about it?

1311
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:28,224
My father didn't have a gun.

1312
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:30,393
You are fucking lying!

1313
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:38,526
Can I go now?

1314
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:42,071
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

1315
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:58,921
Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

1316
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:01,632
Hey, Val.

1317
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:04,302
Nick. How you guys holding up?

1318
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:07,096
- All right.
- It's fucked up.

1319
01:43:09,516 --> 01:43:11,017
Katie.

1320
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:14,270
A fucking tragedy.

1321
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:16,689
Yeah.

1322
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:19,567
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

1323
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:21,152
Yeah?

1324
01:43:21,945 --> 01:43:24,197
Yeah. What do you say, man? Hm?

1325
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:28,159
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

1326
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:34,498
- I gotta get home after a while.
- Don't we all? Hop in.

1327
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:36,459
- Come on, get in.
- All right.

1328
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:40,796
Well, the first round's on me.

1329
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:44,508
Now you're talking.

1330
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:05,154
I think the kid is lying about the gun.

1331
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,740
Absolutely. I told you
three times already.

1332
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:12,912
- What about the father?
- I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is alive.

1333
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:14,664
Eighty grand. I mean...

1334
01:44:14,831 --> 01:44:18,501
...who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

1335
01:44:19,544 --> 01:44:23,172
Listen, go home, have a drink.

1336
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:26,801
- Let it go for a while.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1337
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:29,303
Hey, anything good on the 911?

1338
01:44:29,471 --> 01:44:33,057
- I thought you listened to it.
- I thought you listened to it.

1339
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:40,523
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

1340
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:43,901
There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

1341
01:44:44,069 --> 01:44:47,029
- What's the location of the car?
- Sydney Street.

1342
01:44:47,197 --> 01:44:50,950
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.

1343
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,953
- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.

1344
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:57,206
- Your name, what's your name?
- We're so fucking out of here.

1345
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:59,250
Good luck, man.

1346
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:03,546
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

1347
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:05,298
Her.

1348
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:09,385
- What?
- The kid on the tape.

1349
01:45:13,682 --> 01:45:16,726
- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.

1350
01:45:16,893 --> 01:45:21,022
- He said, "Her name."
- She's a dead girl, refer to her as a she.

1351
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:23,774
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

1352
01:45:23,942 --> 01:45:27,320
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

1353
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:33,284
Play it again.

1354
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:43,085
This one time, we're going
to take down this stamp collector.

1355
01:45:43,253 --> 01:45:45,546
- Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
- Here.

1356
01:45:45,714 --> 01:45:48,966
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.

1357
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:51,886
Mm, fucking Carson.

1358
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:56,182
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own
fucking shoe if you didn't show him.

1359
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:58,768
We all wear suits
because we want to fit in.

1360
01:45:58,935 --> 01:46:03,773
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old
lady gets on. She starts screaming!

1361
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:09,362
Now Val turns to me,
but I'm looking at Carson.

1362
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:11,530
I'm thinking, "What the fuck?"

1363
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:16,994
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

1364
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:18,913
Fucking smiley mask!

1365
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:22,875
Idiot!

1366
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:25,503
And you guys didn't notice till then?

1367
01:46:27,422 --> 01:46:31,759
Shit like that happened all the time on
jobs. That's why Jimmy was so missed.

1368
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:34,720
He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

1369
01:46:37,265 --> 01:46:39,308
Why do you think he went straight?

1370
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:44,480
One word, pure and simple. Katie.

1371
01:46:46,942 --> 01:46:48,776
What about you guys?

1372
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:53,781
What? Us? Going straight?

1373
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,660
That's pretty fucking funny!

1374
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:06,168
We're like bats, we like night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.

1375
01:47:06,336 --> 01:47:08,003
Want another shot?

1376
01:47:11,591 --> 01:47:14,218
You know, I should slow down
till we eat.

1377
01:47:14,386 --> 01:47:16,846
Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!

1378
01:47:17,013 --> 01:47:18,431
Come on, get up.

1379
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:25,688
Live a little, huh?

1380
01:47:53,049 --> 01:47:54,967
Slide over, Dave.

1381
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:59,555
- Dave.
- All right, Val! Now you're talking.

1382
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:03,184
- How you doing?
- I'm a little drunk.

1383
01:48:05,937 --> 01:48:07,730
To our children.

1384
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:14,528
- I always liked this bar.
- Yeah.

1385
01:48:15,947 --> 01:48:18,032
Yeah, nobody bothers you.

1386
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,243
The way it should be,
nobody to bother you in this life.

1387
01:48:21,411 --> 01:48:24,997
No one fucking with you
or your loved ones. Right, Dave?

1388
01:48:25,165 --> 01:48:27,750
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

1389
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:30,503
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.

1390
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,004
Yeah.

1391
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:33,923
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.

1392
01:48:39,804 --> 01:48:41,722
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?

1393
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:55,736
- Drink up, Dave.
- Come on.

1394
01:48:56,446 --> 01:48:58,113
Thanks, Kevin.

1395
01:49:34,317 --> 01:49:37,361
Remember we took Ray Harris here
that time?

1396
01:49:37,529 --> 01:49:42,908
Everybody called this guy "Just Ray,"
but Val here called him "Ray Jingles."

1397
01:49:45,328 --> 01:49:48,122
This guy walked around
with 10 bucks in change...

1398
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:51,208
...in case he had to make a call
to Iraq or something.

1399
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,335
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?

1400
01:49:53,795 --> 01:49:56,672
- You all right?
- Shit. I'm gonna be sick.

1401
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,340
Come on. Come on, now.

1402
01:49:58,508 --> 01:50:03,512
Dave, use the back door. Huey
don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.

1403
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:28,037
Hey, Ray.

1404
01:50:41,217 --> 01:50:44,011
You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?

1405
01:50:48,892 --> 01:50:50,726
Come here a second.

1406
01:50:56,232 --> 01:50:57,775
Sit down.

1407
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,787
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

1408
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,874
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

1409
01:51:14,542 --> 01:51:19,338
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

1410
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:22,091
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

1411
01:51:22,258 --> 01:51:24,885
- Shit, that's terrible.
- My wife had cancer at the time.

1412
01:51:25,053 --> 01:51:27,554
- Yeah, I remember.
- Ray robbed me of being with her...

1413
01:51:27,722 --> 01:51:28,972
...when she was dying.

1414
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:33,394
The death part you do alone, but I could
have helped her with the dying.

1415
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:35,604
Why are you telling me this?

1416
01:51:35,772 --> 01:51:39,983
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

1417
01:51:40,151 --> 01:51:42,611
- We were both crying when I did it.
- Jimmy...

1418
01:51:42,779 --> 01:51:44,321
He was begging.

1419
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:47,241
You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.

1420
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:51,870
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

1421
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:55,457
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

1422
01:51:56,292 --> 01:51:57,710
Who do you hate?

1423
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:01,547
Come on, who?

1424
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:03,215
No one.

1425
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:10,305
- What is it you think I did?
- As I was holding him under the water...

1426
01:52:10,473 --> 01:52:13,976
...I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry...

1427
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,520
...but like if a puppy shit on a rug.

1428
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:18,480
Who do you love?

1429
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:24,778
You love me.

1430
01:52:26,948 --> 01:52:28,323
What about Ma?

1431
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:37,166
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

1432
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:44,298
- You think I killed Katie, don't you?
- Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

1433
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:47,176
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

1434
01:52:47,635 --> 01:52:49,344
This is the mugger story.

1435
01:52:49,512 --> 01:52:51,680
He wasn't a mugger,
he was a child molester.

1436
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:54,057
He was having sex with
this kid in his car.

1437
01:52:54,225 --> 01:52:58,020
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

1438
01:53:06,196 --> 01:53:07,446
Get out of here.

1439
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:21,627
Run!

1440
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:23,879
Dave, run!

1441
01:53:26,049 --> 01:53:29,760
- You killed a child molester.
- Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

1442
01:53:30,595 --> 01:53:33,555
- The molested boy helped you.
- Oh, no. No...

1443
01:53:33,723 --> 01:53:38,352
- You just said you and the boy!
- No, forget that!

1444
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:42,898
- My head gets fucked up sometimes.
- Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

1445
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:47,653
You'd rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

1446
01:53:47,821 --> 01:53:51,323
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

1447
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:55,911
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

1448
01:53:56,079 --> 01:53:58,288
I didn't kill Katie.

1449
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:03,210
I don't remember hearing anything about
any guy's body being found.

1450
01:54:03,378 --> 01:54:07,673
- I put him in the trunk of my car.
- Letting this piece of shit explain?

1451
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:10,843
- Fuck him. Fuck him! Do him!
- I didn't kill her!

1452
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:15,013
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Everybody shut up!

1453
01:54:15,181 --> 01:54:18,767
This is my daughter I'm talking about!
Shut up!

1454
01:54:18,935 --> 01:54:20,269
- Fuck!
- Shut up!

1455
01:54:24,524 --> 01:54:25,816
Nineteen years old.

1456
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:28,443
- I didn't kill Katie!
- Nineteen years old!

1457
01:54:28,611 --> 01:54:31,780
- Look at me, Jimmy!
- I'm looking at you, Dave.

1458
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:33,365
I'm looking at you.

1459
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:36,243
Why'd you do it?

1460
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:41,623
Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's
so many things we gotta make right.

1461
01:54:41,791 --> 01:54:44,459
Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.

1462
01:54:44,836 --> 01:54:47,588
No more lies, no more secrets.

1463
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:50,424
I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.

1464
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:55,512
Right after you do your time. I did mine,
you do yours. Admit what you did.

1465
01:54:56,472 --> 01:54:59,683
- The boy...
- One more time about the boy...

1466
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:01,810
...and I will open you the fuck up.

1467
01:55:07,692 --> 01:55:10,527
I thought I was finished with all this.

1468
01:55:10,904 --> 01:55:14,364
I mean, killing people
and dumping them in the river.

1469
01:55:19,662 --> 01:55:23,206
You admit what you did, Dave,
and I'm gonna let you live.

1470
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:27,669
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1471
01:55:28,296 --> 01:55:31,965
Admit what you did,
and I will give you your life.

1472
01:55:32,133 --> 01:55:34,051
Admit what you did, Dave.

1473
01:55:34,218 --> 01:55:36,511
Admit what you did.

1474
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:41,099
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.

1475
01:55:42,018 --> 01:55:43,560
I know you can speak.

1476
01:55:46,689 --> 01:55:50,317
So say it. Say you love me.

1477
01:55:53,696 --> 01:55:57,366
Don't look at him, look at me.
Now, you say it. You say you love me.

1478
01:56:05,249 --> 01:56:09,044
- He never does anything without you!
- No, let me go! Stop!

1479
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:18,011
I'm coming back!

1480
01:56:24,018 --> 01:56:27,396
You love me so much,
you gotta kill my fucking girlfriend, huh?

1481
01:56:27,563 --> 01:56:32,359
Speak, you fucking freak,
or I will fucking kill you!

1482
01:56:32,568 --> 01:56:34,861
Say her name. Say it.

1483
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:39,199
Say it! Katie!
Say it or you die!

1484
01:56:50,753 --> 01:56:55,257
Kid, you want to point that
toward the floor, okay?

1485
01:56:55,925 --> 01:56:57,592
That's a Sig, right?

1486
01:56:59,929 --> 01:57:02,139
Don't you want to draw it on me?

1487
01:57:03,099 --> 01:57:05,600
No, I don't want to hurt a kid.

1488
01:57:05,893 --> 01:57:08,937
Plus, it looks like somebody else
beat me to it.

1489
01:57:09,772 --> 01:57:12,774
Brendan, man, he fucking punched me.

1490
01:57:13,609 --> 01:57:16,570
- He broke my nose.
- We'll arrest him.

1491
01:57:16,738 --> 01:57:20,407
- Haul his ass to jail if you like.
- I don't want him arrested.

1492
01:57:21,117 --> 01:57:22,826
I want him fucking dead!

1493
01:57:30,209 --> 01:57:35,505
Motherfucker.

1494
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:40,719
Admit what you did, Dave...

1495
01:57:41,804 --> 01:57:43,805
...and I'll let you live.

1496
01:57:43,973 --> 01:57:48,185
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1497
01:57:48,561 --> 01:57:50,729
You'll go to prison...

1498
01:57:51,814 --> 01:57:55,192
...but I'll give you your life.
Admit it, Dave.

1499
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:58,487
Admit what you did. Admit it.

1500
01:58:03,409 --> 01:58:05,160
Yeah.

1501
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:09,206
Yeah, I did it.

1502
01:58:12,668 --> 01:58:15,962
Why?

1503
01:58:19,133 --> 01:58:23,428
That night in McGill's...

1504
01:58:24,388 --> 01:58:29,017
...she reminded me of a dream I had.

1505
01:58:30,228 --> 01:58:31,645
What dream?

1506
01:58:33,147 --> 01:58:35,607
A dream of youth.

1507
01:58:37,944 --> 01:58:40,529
I don't remember having one.

1508
01:58:42,990 --> 01:58:44,991
So it was the dream?

1509
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:49,079
The dream, yeah.

1510
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:55,669
You'd know what I mean
if you'd got in that car instead of me.

1511
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:05,220
But I didn't get in that car, Dave.

1512
01:59:06,514 --> 01:59:09,432
Hang on. Come here. You did.

1513
01:59:30,872 --> 01:59:33,248
We bury our sins here, Dave.

1514
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:38,587
We wash them clean.

1515
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:45,093
- His fucking lips are still moving.
- I got eyes, Val.

1516
01:59:51,559 --> 01:59:53,602
I wasn't ready.

1517
01:59:59,609 --> 02:00:00,942
It's like I said, Dave.

1518
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:05,947
This part, you do alone.

1519
02:00:50,868 --> 02:00:52,744
Tough night?

1520
02:00:55,498 --> 02:00:57,499
Yeah, me too.

1521
02:00:59,502 --> 02:01:02,420
Saw a bullet with my name on it.

1522
02:01:11,138 --> 02:01:12,889
We got them, Jim.

1523
02:01:16,644 --> 02:01:18,019
Got who?

1524
02:01:18,562 --> 02:01:20,730
Katie's killers. Got them cold.

1525
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:28,154
Killers, plural.

1526
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:34,286
Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son
Ray Jr. and another kid, John O'Shea.

1527
02:01:34,453 --> 02:01:36,871
They just confessed a couple hours ago.

1528
02:01:41,544 --> 02:01:42,919
No doubt?

1529
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:45,380
None.

1530
02:01:54,682 --> 02:01:56,182
Why?

1531
02:01:57,727 --> 02:01:59,477
They don't know.

1532
02:01:59,645 --> 02:02:02,188
They were playing with a gun,
saw a car coming...

1533
02:02:02,356 --> 02:02:07,444
...one of the kids lies down in the street,
car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.

1534
02:02:09,238 --> 02:02:13,116
O'Shea says they just meant to scare her
and the gun went off.

1535
02:02:13,284 --> 02:02:16,703
But she hit him with her door, ran...

1536
02:02:16,871 --> 02:02:20,790
...and they chased her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

1537
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:30,592
And the beating they gave her?

1538
02:02:33,095 --> 02:02:34,763
Ray Jr. had a hockey stick.

1539
02:02:37,933 --> 02:02:40,185
All right. Go easy.

1540
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:42,270
Take a breath.

1541
02:02:43,647 --> 02:02:45,482
Look at me.

1542
02:02:45,775 --> 02:02:47,692
Look at me, Jimmy.

1543
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:52,364
I got a call from Celeste Boyle.

1544
02:02:52,531 --> 02:02:56,868
She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing,
says you might know where he is.

1545
02:02:57,828 --> 02:03:00,080
We need to talk to him.

1546
02:03:00,456 --> 02:03:04,918
Boston P.D. found the body of a guy
in the woods behind McGill's.

1547
02:03:05,086 --> 02:03:07,504
A body? The body of a guy?

1548
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:11,299
Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.

1549
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:14,386
They want to talk to Dave about it.

1550
02:03:14,929 --> 02:03:16,971
So, Jimmy...

1551
02:03:17,932 --> 02:03:20,517
...when was the last time
you saw Dave?

1552
02:03:31,237 --> 02:03:34,447
The last time I saw Dave.

1553
02:03:35,991 --> 02:03:39,202
Yeah. Dave Boyle.

1554
02:03:47,503 --> 02:03:51,840
- Dave Boyle.
- Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.

1555
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:59,305
That was 25 years ago, going up
this street in the back of that car.

1556
02:04:08,524 --> 02:04:12,527
Jimmy, what did you do?

1557
02:04:20,661 --> 02:04:23,621
Thanks for finding
my daughter's killers, Sean.

1558
02:04:27,376 --> 02:04:29,878
If only you'd been a little faster.

1559
02:04:38,137 --> 02:04:41,848
Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle
500 a month too?

1560
02:04:48,439 --> 02:04:51,065
Sometimes I think...

1561
02:04:52,026 --> 02:04:54,986
I think all three of us got in that car.

1562
02:04:55,821 --> 02:05:00,074
And all of this is just a dream,
you know?

1563
02:05:00,242 --> 02:05:02,410
A dream, sure.

1564
02:05:03,787 --> 02:05:06,080
In reality...

1565
02:05:06,248 --> 02:05:10,960
...we're still 11 -year-old boys
locked in a cellar...

1566
02:05:11,128 --> 02:05:14,714
...imagining what our lives
would have been if we'd escaped.

1567
02:05:22,848 --> 02:05:24,933
Maybe you're right.

1568
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:27,435
Who the fuck knows?

1569
02:05:55,798 --> 02:05:57,966
Yeah, this is Sean.

1570
02:06:03,889 --> 02:06:06,975
I'm sorry. I need you to know that.

1571
02:06:07,142 --> 02:06:09,435
I pushed you away.

1572
02:06:12,189 --> 02:06:14,607
I'm sorry too.

1573
02:06:15,568 --> 02:06:18,361
Things have been so messed up.

1574
02:06:18,529 --> 02:06:21,114
Loving you, hating you.

1575
02:06:23,325 --> 02:06:24,993
Come home?

1576
02:06:27,746 --> 02:06:29,706
You change the locks or anything?

1577
02:06:30,833 --> 02:06:32,584
No.

1578
02:06:33,544 --> 02:06:36,671
No, everything is just the way you left it.

1579
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,633
- Nora.
- What's that?

1580
02:06:41,885 --> 02:06:45,555
Nora. That's our daughter's name, Sean.

1581
02:06:46,682 --> 02:06:48,433
Nora, huh?

1582
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:52,604
Well, I like that. Nora.

1583
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:24,761
I killed Dave.

1584
02:07:25,554 --> 02:07:28,681
I killed him, and I threw him
in the Mystic.

1585
02:07:29,725 --> 02:07:31,601
But I killed the wrong man.

1586
02:07:32,269 --> 02:07:34,562
That's what I've done.

1587
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:37,607
- And I can't undo it.
- Shh.

1588
02:07:38,609 --> 02:07:40,443
Jimmy.

1589
02:07:42,446 --> 02:07:44,614
Shh.

1590
02:07:48,285 --> 02:07:51,120
I wanna feel your heart.

1591
02:07:51,914 --> 02:07:53,247
Last night...

1592
02:07:53,666 --> 02:07:57,835
...when I put the girls to bed,
I told them how big your heart was.

1593
02:07:58,003 --> 02:08:01,089
- I told them how much you loved Katie...
- Annabeth.

1594
02:08:01,256 --> 02:08:02,924
...because you created her.

1595
02:08:03,092 --> 02:08:07,011
And sometimes,
your love for her was so big...

1596
02:08:07,179 --> 02:08:10,973
...it felt like your heart would explode...
- Please stop.

1597
02:08:11,141 --> 02:08:14,977
I told them their daddy
loved them that much too.

1598
02:08:15,145 --> 02:08:18,648
That he had four hearts,
and they were all filled up...

1599
02:08:18,816 --> 02:08:22,777
...and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry.

1600
02:08:22,945 --> 02:08:28,991
And that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved.

1601
02:08:29,159 --> 02:08:32,370
And that is never wrong.

1602
02:08:32,538 --> 02:08:38,459
That can never be wrong,
no matter what their daddy had to do.

1603
02:08:38,627 --> 02:08:43,339
And those girls fell asleep at peace.

1604
02:08:51,849 --> 02:08:56,352
You said, "Last night." You knew?

1605
02:08:57,438 --> 02:08:59,647
Celeste called, looking for you.

1606
02:08:59,815 --> 02:09:03,151
She was worried something might
happen. She told me about Dave.

1607
02:09:03,318 --> 02:09:06,154
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife...

1608
02:09:06,321 --> 02:09:09,490
...says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?

1609
02:09:09,658 --> 02:09:13,828
- Why didn't you call?
- Because it's like I told the girls.

1610
02:09:14,246 --> 02:09:16,497
Their daddy's a king.

1611
02:09:16,665 --> 02:09:20,918
And a king knows what to do
and does it.

1612
02:09:21,086 --> 02:09:22,670
Even when it's hard.

1613
02:09:22,838 --> 02:09:27,216
And their daddy will do whatever
he has to for those he loves.

1614
02:09:27,384 --> 02:09:30,178
And that's all that matters.

1615
02:09:35,058 --> 02:09:38,728
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.

1616
02:09:38,896 --> 02:09:41,189
Everyone but us.

1617
02:09:41,356 --> 02:09:43,524
We will never be weak.

1618
02:09:43,692 --> 02:09:45,860
And you...

1619
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:49,447
You could rule this town.

1620
02:09:53,243 --> 02:09:55,870
And after, Jimmy...

1621
02:09:56,038 --> 02:09:58,790
...let's take the girls down to the parade.

1622
02:09:58,957 --> 02:10:01,709
Katie would have liked that.

1623
02:11:38,724 --> 02:11:40,641
Michael!

1624
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:45,521
Michael! Michael!

1625
02:11:46,815 --> 02:11:51,319
Michael!
