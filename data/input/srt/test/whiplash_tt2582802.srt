Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea
how you're gonna take this,

942
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:19,767
but the band I'm leading for JVC,
my drummer is not cutting it.

No.

was incentive for you.

Tanner switched to premed.

but I'm just really sorry. Um...

I actually have this show this weekend.

It's a, uh...

if maybe you'd wanna go,

963
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,643
and we, you know, maybe
get some, like, pizza afterwards,

about our schools again.
