1
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:55,278
There are more than yesterday.

2
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,878
He will be saying prayers in
the garden. Just follow the others.

3
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:24,722
He will be saying prayers in
the garden. Just follow the others.

4
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:38,968
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

5
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:42,599
Oh, God!

6
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:35,846
The object of this massive tribute ...

7
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,007
...died as he had always lived:

8
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,204
A private man...

9
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,478
...without wealth...

10
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,042
...without property...

11
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,644
...without official title or office.

12
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:47,042
Mahatma Gandhi...

13
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:49,001
...was not the commander of armies...

14
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,683
...nor a ruler of vast lands.

15
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,757
He could not boast
any scientific achievement...

16
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,641
...or artistic gift.

17
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,038
Yet men...

18
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:02,806
...governments, dignitaries
from all over the world...

19
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,840
...have joined hands today
to pay homage...

20
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:07,609
...to this little brown man
in the loincloth...

21
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,562
...who led his country to freedom.

22
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:13,645
In the words of
General George C. Marshall...

23
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:16,798
...the American secretary of state:

24
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:20,088
"Mahatma Gandhi has become
the spokesman...

25
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:23,088
...for the conscience of all mankind.

26
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:24,803
He was a man...

27
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,442
...who made humility...

28
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,203
...and simple truth...

29
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,323
...more powerful than empires."

30
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,400
And Albert Einstein added:

31
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,081
"Generations to come will scarce
believe that such a one as this...

32
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,365
...ever in flesh and blood...

33
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,279
...walked upon this earth."

34
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:25,885
Tell me...

35
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,446
...do you think about hell?

36
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,485
No, neither do I.

37
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,680
But this man here...

38
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:37,160
...is a Christian, and he's written
that in order to believe...

39
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,238
Excuse me, sir.

40
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,804
How long have you been
in South Africa?

41
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,085
A week.

42
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,644
I don't know how you got a ticket.

43
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,560
Just what are you doing
in this car, coolie?

44
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,485
Why, I have a ticket.

45
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:56,885
A first-class ticket.

46
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:00,563
- How did you get it?
- I sent for it in the post.

47
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,003
I'm an attorney.
I didn't...

48
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:04,319
There are no coloured attorneys
in South Africa.

49
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:05,684
Sit where you belong!

50
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,959
I'll take your luggage back, sir.

51
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,006
Just a moment, please.

52
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:11,884
You see?

53
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,448
Mohandas K. Gandhi, attorney at law.

54
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:18,641
I'm going to conduct a case
for an Indian trading firm.

55
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,360
Didn't you hear me? There are no
coloured attorneys in South Africa.

56
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,839
I was called to the bar in London...

57
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,167
...and enrolled at
the High Court of Chancery.

58
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:31,200
I am, therefore, an attorney.

59
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,838
And since I am,
in your eyes, coloured...

60
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,245
...I think we can deduce
that there is at least...

61
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,246
...one coloured attorney
in South Africa.

62
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,280
Smart bloody Kaffir!

63
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:42,518
Throw him out.

64
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,999
Just move your black ass
back to third class...

65
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,524
...or I'll have you thrown off
at the next station.

66
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:49,441
But I always go first class!

67
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:58,085
But you're a rich man.
Why put up with it?

68
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,599
Yes, I am rich. But I am Indian.

69
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,039
I do not expect
to travel first class.

70
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:05,558
- In England, I was a poor student.
- That was England.

71
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,361
This is part of England's Empire.

72
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:12,120
Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and
you see a successful Muslim trader.

73
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:15,042
Most South Africans see him
simply as an Indian.

74
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,838
And the vast majority of Indians,
mostly Hindus, like yourself...

75
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,882
...were brought here to
work mines and harvest crops.

76
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,484
Most Europeans don't want them
doing anything else.

77
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,048
But that is very unchristian...

78
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,405
Mr. Gandhi, in this country...

79
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,278
...lndians are not allowed to walk
along the pavement with a Christian.

80
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:38,201
You mean, you employ Mr. Baker
as your attorney...

81
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:39,962
...but you can't walk down
the street with him?

82
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:41,638
Well, I can.

83
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:44,962
But I risk being kicked
into the gutter by someone...

84
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,683
...less holy than Mr. Baker.

85
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:59,166
Well, then it must be fought.

86
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:01,639
We are children of God
like everyone else.

87
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,077
Allah be praised!

88
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,684
And what battalions
will you call upon?

89
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,362
I will write to the press...

90
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,719
...here and in England.

91
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:15,238
I will use the courts.

92
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,798
You'll cause a lot of trouble.
Our position is...

93
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:20,477
We are members of the Empire.

94
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:24,528
And we come from
an ancient civilization.

95
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,201
Why should we not walk on
the pavements like other men?

96
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:32,328
I rather like the idea of
an Indian barrister in South Africa.

97
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:36,437
I'm sure our community could
keep you in work for some time...

98
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:39,283
...even if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

99
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:44,079
Especially if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

100
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:05,727
There's the English reporter.
I told you he'd come.

101
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:10,959
You also said your article
would draw a thousand people.

102
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,605
At least some of the Hindus
brought their wives.

103
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,279
No, I asked my wife
to organize that.

104
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,128
Some of them are leaving.

105
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:33,408
"Ladies and gentlemen:

106
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,642
We have asked you to gather here
to help us proclaim our right...

107
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,886
...to be treated as equal citizens
of the Empire.

108
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:43,081
We do not seek conflict.

109
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,119
We know the strength of
the forces arrayed against us...

110
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:52,005
...know that because of them,
we can only use peaceful means.

111
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:55,400
But we are determined
that justice will be done.

112
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,565
The symbol of our status
is embodied in this pass...

113
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:02,999
...which we must carry
at all times...

114
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,968
...but which no European
even has to have.

115
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,928
The first step towards
changing our status...

116
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,162
...is to eliminate
this difference between us."

117
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:21,045
Now?

118
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:30,242
You write brilliantly, but you have
much to learn about handling men.

119
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:34,600
"We do not want to ignite...

120
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,078
...the fear or hatred of anyone.

121
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:39,958
But we ask you...

122
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,283
...Hindu, Muslim and Sikh...

123
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,202
...to help us light up the sky...

124
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,602
...and the minds of
the British authorities...

125
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:52,846
...with our defiance
of this injustice."

126
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:58,808
We will now burn the passes of
our committee and its supporters.

127
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:03,007
We ask you to put
your passes on the fire...

128
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:04,483
You bloody dog!

129
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:11,285
Those passes...

130
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,760
...are government property!

131
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:18,084
And I will arrest the first man
who tries to burn one!

132
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:30,443
Take him away.

133
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:52,598
You little...

134
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:54,158
...Sammy...

135
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:55,599
...bastard!

136
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,918
Now! Are there any more?

137
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:03,207
If you want this kind of trouble,
you can have it.

138
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:27,284
Let me go!

139
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,202
Let me go!

140
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:49,598
Stop.

141
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:10,279
The London papers have
arrived from the Cape.

142
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:11,842
<i>The worst was the Daily Mail.</i>

143
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,323
They said the burning of passes...

144
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:16,521
- Ask Mr. Herzog to see me.
...-was the most significant act...

145
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,846
...in colonial affairs since
the Declaration of Independence.

146
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,244
They'll find we're better
prepared this time.

147
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,481
Mr. Gandhi will find
he's on a long hiding to nothing.

148
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:29,882
"A High Court judge confirmed
that Mr. Gandhi...

149
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,360
...would've been within his rights
to prosecute for assault...

150
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:36,561
...since neither he nor Mr. Khan
resisted arrest."

151
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,441
I told you about English law.

152
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:41,487
As I told you about English policemen.

153
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:43,688
Yes?

154
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:47,449
We're very pleased
to have you back, Papa.

155
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,845
And I am glad to be back.

156
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:50,845
Come.

157
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:54,287
Mind your face.

158
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:03,647
Tomorrow I'll tell you about
my days in a police hospital.

159
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,158
Come, come.

160
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:14,920
Just like proper English gentlemen.
I'm proud of them.

161
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:18,286
They're boys and they're Indian.

162
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:23,878
Will you take this off?
It pinches every time I speak.

163
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:31,282
I've got it.

164
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:40,887
You'd be Gandhi.

165
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:43,842
I thought you'd be bigger.

166
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,404
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

167
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,406
My name is Charlie Andrews, sir.

168
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,837
I've come from India.

169
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:55,485
I've read a great deal about you.

170
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,568
Some of it good, I hope.

171
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:00,888
Would you care to walk?

172
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,807
You're a clergyman?

173
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:06,840
I met some remarkable people in India.

174
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:09,961
And when I read what you were doing,
I wanted to help.

175
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:12,000
- Does that surprise you?
- Not anymore.

176
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,921
At first, I was amazed...

177
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,718
...but when you're fighting
in a just cause...

178
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:21,081
...people seem to pop up, like you,
right out of the pavement.

179
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:24,083
Even when it's dangerous or...

180
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,607
Hey, look what's coming!

181
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:31,881
A white shepherd leading
a brown Sammy!

182
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:34,602
Perhaps we should...

183
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:36,323
Doesn't the New Testament say:

184
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:39,839
"If your enemy strikes you on
the right cheek, offer him the left"?

185
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,483
The phrase was used metaphorically.
I don't think our Lord...

186
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:43,883
I'm not so sure.

187
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:46,444
I have thought about it a great deal.

188
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,605
I suspect He meant
you must show courage...

189
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,802
...be willing to take a blow,
several blows, to show...

190
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:54,569
...you won't strike back,
nor will you be turned aside.

191
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:58,523
And when you do that, it calls on
something in human nature...

192
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:02,199
...that makes his hatred for you
decrease and his respect increase.

193
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,600
I think Christ grasped that,
and I have seen it work.

194
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:07,004
Good morning.

195
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,479
Get off the pavement,
you bloody coon.

196
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:10,957
- Yeah, get off.
- Kaffir!

197
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:14,122
Colin, what you doing?

198
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:15,199
Nothing.

199
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:17,206
Come out where I can see you!

200
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,200
I said, what you doing?

201
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:26,328
We were just trying
to clean up the neighbourhood.

202
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:29,760
You're late for work.
I thought you'd gone 1 0 minutes ago.

203
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:31,687
Get on!

204
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:39,485
You'll find there's room for us all.

205
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:49,444
- That was lucky.
- I thought you were a man of God.

206
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,685
I am, but I'm not
so egotistical as to think...

207
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:53,720
...He plans His day
around my dilemmas.

208
00:18:57,689 --> 00:18:59,805
You could call it
a communal farm, I suppose.

209
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:02,398
But you've all come
to the same conclusions.

210
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,043
Our Gita, the Muslim's Koran,
your Bible.

211
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:08,321
It's always the simple things
that catch your breath.

212
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:10,805
"Love thy neighbour as thyself."

213
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:12,884
Not always practised...

214
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:16,320
...but it's something we Hindus
could learn a lot from.

215
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:19,129
That's the kind of thing
you'll be seeking on this farm?

216
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:20,722
Well, we shall try.

217
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:22,721
Bad news, I'm afraid.

218
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,523
They're going to change the pass laws.

219
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:31,038
It's taken time...

220
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,445
...but it needed to be done fairly.

221
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,928
We didn't want to create an injustice
simply because Mr. Gandhi...

222
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:39,597
...was abusing our
existing legislation.

223
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,284
Just one moment, sir, please.

224
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:46,287
I beg your pardon.

225
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:49,277
But on a short trip...

226
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:53,243
...I wouldn't spend too much time
on the Indian question, Mr. Walker.

227
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,167
It's a tiny factor
in South Africa.

228
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,606
Well, it is news at the moment.

229
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:02,482
I plan to report on
the condition of the mines here...

230
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:05,004
...as well as the economy.
- Good.

231
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:06,927
But I would like to meet
this Mr. Gand-eye.

232
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:08,608
Gandhi.

233
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:12,883
Of course.
We Westerners have a weakness...

234
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:15,842
...for these spiritually inclined
men of India.

235
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:18,839
But as an old lawyer,
let me warn you.

236
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,887
Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man
as you will ever meet...

237
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,649
...however otherworldly he may seem.

238
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,643
But I'm sure you're enough
of a reporter to see that.

239
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:30,522
I hope so.
Thank you for your time, sir.

240
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:37,323
So it's not spiritualism
or nationalism.

241
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,562
We're not resisting anything but the
idea that people can't live together.

242
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:42,918
You see?

243
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:45,407
Hindus, Muslims...

244
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,446
...Sikhs, Jews...

245
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:49,164
...even Christians.

246
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:51,765
<i>Mr. Walker of the New York Times.</i>

247
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:52,879
How you doing?

248
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,526
Without a paper,
a journal of some kind...

249
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:59,526
...you cannot unite a community.

250
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:02,727
You belong to a
very important profession.

251
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,519
And what do you think an important
professional should write...

252
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:12,119
...about your response to
General Smuts' newest legislation?

253
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:14,048
I don't know.

254
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,484
I'm still searching for a response.

255
00:21:16,729 --> 00:21:18,447
You will respect the law?

256
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:23,806
There are unjust laws
as there are unjust men.

257
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,088
You're a small minority to take on
the South African government...

258
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,802
...not to mention the British Empire.

259
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:32,280
If you are a minority of one...

260
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,799
...the truth is the truth.

261
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:37,797
Herman Kallenbach...

262
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:40,882
...our chief carpenter,
also our chief benefactor.

263
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:42,727
<i>Vince Walker, New York Times.</i>

264
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,800
This is quite a place
you've got here.

265
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:47,884
And you call it an ashram?

266
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,887
That's right.
The word only means "community."

267
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,240
But it could stand for
"village" or "the world."

268
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:56,639
You're an ambitious man, Mr. Gandhi.

269
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:58,481
I hope not.

270
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:05,037
I hear that you also prepare
the meals and clean the toilets.

271
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,883
- Is that part of the experiment?
- Ba!

272
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:12,445
We will need another place set
for Mr. Walker's driver.

273
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:14,768
I will tell Tara.

274
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:20,243
Yes, it's one way to learn
that each man's labour...

275
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:22,121
...is as important as another's.

276
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,445
While you're doing it,
cleaning the toilet...

277
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:26,805
...seems far more important
than the law.

278
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:28,927
Please, come and join us.

279
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:31,808
You'll need something before
your journey back.

280
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:35,087
- Would you excuse me, please?
- Yeah, sure.

281
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,088
What is it?

282
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:49,643
Sora was sent to tell me I must...

283
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,001
...rake and cover the latrine.

284
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:53,318
That's right.

285
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:55,287
Everyone takes their turn.

286
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:56,843
It is the work of untouchables!

287
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:59,848
In this place,
there are no untouchables...

288
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:01,880
...and no work is beneath any of us.

289
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:03,758
I'm your wife!

290
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,647
All the more reason.

291
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:09,768
As you command.

292
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:15,845
The others may follow you,
but you forget...

293
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,405
...I knew you when you were a boy.

294
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:20,128
It's not me.

295
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:22,721
It's the principle.

296
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,485
And you will do it with joy
or not do it at all.

297
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,286
Not at all then.

298
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:35,085
All right then, go.
You don't belong here!

299
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,964
Go and leave the ashram altogether.
We don't want you!

300
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:40,838
Have you no shame?

301
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:42,448
I'm your wife!

302
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:56,279
Where do you expect me to go?

303
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:59,885
What's the matter with me?

304
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:08,768
You're human.

305
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,487
Only human.

306
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:16,885
And it's even harder
for those of us...

307
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,684
...who do not even want to be
as good as you do.

308
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:25,968
I apologize.

309
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,324
I must get back to that reporter.

310
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:37,487
And I must...

311
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,520
...rake and cover the latrine.

312
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:08,640
I want to welcome you all.

313
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:11,727
Every one of you.

314
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:15,162
We have no secrets.

315
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:24,888
Let us begin by being clear...

316
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:27,728
...about General Smuts' new law.

317
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,681
All Indians must now
be fingerprinted...

318
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:32,799
...like criminals.

319
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:34,727
Men and women.

320
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:38,803
No marriage other than a Christian
marriage is considered valid.

321
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:40,488
Under this act...

322
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:43,363
...our wives and mothers are whores.

323
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:47,081
And every man here is a bastard.

324
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:53,724
He has become quite good at this.

325
00:25:56,129 --> 00:25:58,324
And a policeman...

326
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:01,689
...passing an Indian dwelling...

327
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:03,686
...I will not call them homes...

328
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,683
...may enter and demand the card of any
Indian woman whose dwelling it is.

329
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:09,800
Goddamn them!

330
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,284
Understand...

331
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,087
...he does not have to
stand at the door.

332
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:18,598
He may enter.

333
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,077
I will not allow it!

334
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:22,964
I swear to Allah.

335
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:27,487
I'll kill the man who offers
that insult to my home and my wife...

336
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:30,284
...and let them hang me!

337
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:38,081
I say: Talk means nothing!

338
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:42,687
Kill a few officials before
they disgrace one Indian woman.

339
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:46,359
Then they might think twice
about such laws.

340
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:50,443
In that cause,
I would be willing to die!

341
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:01,163
I praise such courage.

342
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,042
I need such courage...

343
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,400
...because, in this cause,
I too am prepared to die.

344
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:09,048
But, my friend...

345
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:14,200
...there is no cause for which
I am prepared to kill.

346
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:16,927
Whatever they do to us...

347
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:19,040
...we will attack no one...

348
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:21,126
...kill no one.

349
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:25,044
But we will not give
our fingerprints, not one of us.

350
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,808
They will imprison us. They will fine
us. They will seize our possessions.

351
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:33,162
But they cannot take away
our self-respect...

352
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:34,802
...if we do not give it to them.

353
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:36,965
Have you been to prison?

354
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:40,288
They beat us and torture us.
I say...

355
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:43,448
I am asking you to fight.

356
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:48,123
To fight against their anger,
not to provoke it.

357
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:53,043
We will not strike a blow.

358
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:56,079
But we will receive them.

359
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:57,722
And through our pain...

360
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,201
...we will make them see
their injustice.

361
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:03,001
And it will hurt...

362
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,525
...as all fighting hurts.

363
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:08,886
But we cannot lose.

364
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:11,128
We cannot.

365
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:15,205
They may torture my body...

366
00:28:15,889 --> 00:28:17,959
...break my bones...

367
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:19,761
...even kill me.

368
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,244
Then...

369
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:24,204
...they will have my dead body...

370
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:27,597
...not my obedience.

371
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:49,567
We are Hindu and Muslim...

372
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:53,003
...children of God, each one of us.

373
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:57,805
Let us take a solemn oath
in His name...

374
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,525
...that, come what may...

375
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:04,886
...we will not submit to this law.

376
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:48,724
<i>God save our gracious King</i>

377
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:53,844
<i>God save our noble King</i>

378
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:57,924
<i>God save our King</i>

379
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:58,883
These men are contracted labourers.

380
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,408
They belong in the mines.

381
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,958
You put their comrades in jail.

382
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:03,965
When you free them...

383
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:06,401
...they will go back to work.

384
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:08,568
I've warned you.

385
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:10,762
We've warned each other.

386
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,205
I don't think that's very good.

387
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:07,519
Steady, steady.

388
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:08,838
Stop!

389
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:22,162
At the canter, charge!

390
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:26,044
We should lie down.

391
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:27,085
Down!

392
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,918
The horses won't trample on us.
Lie down!

393
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:11,486
Follow me! Follow me!

394
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:32,482
Now what the hell do we do?

395
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:34,686
Let them march.

396
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:40,720
In our own sweet time,
in our own sweet way...

397
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:42,647
...we'll get them.

398
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:46,964
One law!

399
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:48,045
One king!

400
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:49,278
One law!

401
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:50,683
One king!

402
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:59,168
Some of you may be rejoicing that
Mr. Gandhi has been put into prison.

403
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:03,879
But I would ask you, assembled
here in this house of God...

404
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:07,885
...to recognize that we are
witnessing something new...

405
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,201
...something so unexpected,
so unusual...

406
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,088
...that it is not surprising
the government is at a loss.

407
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:18,038
What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do...

408
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:20,809
...is ask questions about ourselves.

409
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:26,008
As Christians, those are
difficult questions to answer.

410
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:32,404
How do we treat men
who defy an unjust law...

411
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,247
...who will not fight...

412
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,965
...but will not comply?

413
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,362
As Christians, or as people
who have not heard the word...

414
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:57,085
They're sparing no one, I see.

415
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:01,128
No, you were the surprise.

416
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:03,286
It has been all over the prison.

417
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:05,759
We thought they'd be too afraid
of the English press.

418
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,641
So did I.

419
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:19,567
I don't know who they've
left out there to do the work.

420
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:21,838
Have they touched the women?

421
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:26,207
My wife publicly defied the law.
They've arrested her and four others.

422
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,246
It split the government.

423
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:30,838
Well, that's one victory.

424
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:34,439
If we hold firm,
it won't be the last.

425
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:35,684
Don't worry.

426
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:38,602
I've never seen men so determined.

427
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:41,044
You have given them a way to fight.

428
00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:47,038
Gandhi!

429
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,003
I want Gandhi!

430
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:51,080
Which Sammy is it?

431
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:32,083
Mr. Gandhi.

432
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,999
I thought we might have
a little talk.

433
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,008
Thank you, Daniels.

434
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:44,040
Will you have a glass of sherry?

435
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:46,128
Thank you, no.

436
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:47,444
Perhaps some tea?

437
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,487
I dined at the prison.

438
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:56,437
Please, do come and sit down.

439
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,239
I've more or less decided to ask
the House to repeal the act...

440
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,838
...that you have taken
such exception to.

441
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:22,447
Well, if you asked, General Smuts,
I'm sure it will be done.

442
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,845
It's not quite that simple.

443
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:27,040
Somehow, I expected not.

444
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,928
I thought of calling for
a royal commission...

445
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:32,239
...to investigate the new legislation.

446
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:36,325
I think I could guarantee they would
recommend the act be repealed.

447
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:38,448
I congratulate them.

448
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:40,162
But they might also recommend...

449
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:44,525
...that all future Indian immigration
be severely restricted...

450
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:46,847
...even stopped.

451
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:58,848
Immigration was not an issue
on which we fought.

452
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:02,246
It would be wrong of us
to make it one, now that we...

453
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:06,164
We are in a position of advantage.

454
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:16,205
I'm ordering the release of all
prisoners within the next 24 hours.

455
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:19,883
You yourself are free
as from this moment.

456
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:29,562
Assuming we are in agreement.

457
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:31,887
Yes, yes.

458
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:36,486
It's just that in these clothes,
I would prefer to go by taxi.

459
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:37,804
All right. Fine.

460
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:41,488
I'm afraid I have no money.

461
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:45,083
Neither have I.

462
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,440
I'm awfully sorry.

463
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:49,805
Daniels...

464
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:53,041
...will you lend Mr. Gandhi
a shilling for a taxi?

465
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:55,242
I beg your pardon, sir?

466
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,245
How far will you be going, Gandhi?

467
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:02,846
Now that this is settled, I'd thought
seriously of going back to India.

468
00:39:03,649 --> 00:39:06,766
But a shilling will do splendidly
for the moment.

469
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:15,998
Thank you.

470
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:23,564
I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...

471
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:26,277
...but I can find my own way out.

472
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,083
Guard of honour!

473
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:46,884
Guard of honour!

474
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:48,847
Attention!

475
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,758
Present arms!

476
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:11,648
- My God, he loves it!
- I'm sure he hates it.

477
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:14,967
Generals' reputations are
being made in France today...

478
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:16,761
...fighting on the Western front.

479
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,803
Not as military governors in India.

480
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,488
What the devil's going on back there?

481
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:27,282
Must be that Indian who made
all that fuss in Africa.

482
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:29,360
My cabin boy told me he was onboard.

483
00:40:30,649 --> 00:40:31,843
There he is.

484
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:36,479
God, he's dressed like a coolie!

485
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,203
I thought he was a lawyer.

486
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:41,839
Mr. Gandhi, have you refused
to wear European clothes?

487
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:43,602
No, I haven't refused.

488
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:46,807
I simply wanted to dress the way
my comrades in prison dress.

489
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,687
Will you support the war effort?

490
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:53,519
If I wish to enjoy the benefits
and protection of the British Empire...

491
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:57,125
...it would be wrong of me
not to help in its defence.

492
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,445
Now that you're back in India,
what will you do?

493
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:00,917
I don't know.

494
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,841
- I don't know.
- One more question.

495
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:06,638
As an Indian woman, how could you
accept the indignity of prison?

496
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:09,767
My dignity comes
from following my husband.

497
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,237
Thank you very much.

498
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:20,489
Just a few words, then we'll
get you to civilization.

499
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:21,798
May I?

500
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:34,481
I'm glad to be home...

501
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,640
...and I thank you for your greeting.

502
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:00,957
I'll follow with your wife.

503
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:02,847
Don't worry.
Everything's arranged.

504
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:07,799
Who's that young man?

505
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:09,277
That's young Nehru.

506
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:11,957
He's got his father's intellect,
his mother's good looks...

507
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:13,562
...and the devil's own charm.

508
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:17,199
If they don't ruin him at Cambridge...
Wave, wave!

509
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:19,282
He might amount to something.

510
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:29,245
I must say, when I first saw you as
a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay...

511
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:31,605
...I never thought I'd greet you
as a national hero.

512
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:33,647
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

513
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:35,442
Yes, you are!

514
00:42:35,649 --> 00:42:38,447
It's been 200 years
since an Indian cocked a snook...

515
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,839
...at the British Empire
and got away with it.

516
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:45,565
And stop calling me Mr. Patel.
You're not a junior clerk anymore.

517
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:13,448
The new military governor of the
Northwest Province was on that ship.

518
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:15,845
Too bad you came back third class.

519
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:17,448
He might have been impressed...

520
00:43:17,689 --> 00:43:20,999
...by a successful barrister
who'd outmaneuvered General Smuts.

521
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:23,842
Yes, I'm sure.

522
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:36,763
Are you involved too, Mrs. Nehru?

523
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:41,038
No. I leave practical matters
to my husband...

524
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:43,484
...and revolution to my son.

525
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:47,478
Mr. Gandhi, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Jinnah, our joint host...

526
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:49,646
...member of congress and leader
of the Muslim League...

527
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:51,163
How do you do?

528
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:53,445
And Mr. Prakash, who, I fear...

529
00:43:53,649 --> 00:43:56,846
...is awaiting trial for sedition
and inducement to murder.

530
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:00,317
I have not actually pulled
the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.

531
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:01,718
I have simply written...

532
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:05,126
...if an Englishman kills an Indian
for disobeying his law...

533
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:07,200
...it is an Indian's duty
to kill an Englishman...

534
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:09,883
...for enforcing his law
in a land that is not his.

535
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:13,605
It's a clever argument. It may not
produce the end you desire.

536
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:18,001
We hope you'll join us in our
struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.

537
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:22,088
Excuse me. May l, Mohan?
There's someone I'd like him to meet.

538
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:23,318
Excuse me.

539
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,008
Sorry to rush you.

540
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:30,763
He told the press
he'd support the British in the war.

541
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,607
That's nonviolence for you.

542
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:35,239
You know, Mohan...

543
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:37,879
...now I have a confession to make.

544
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:40,718
I didn't decide to come
to South Africa.

545
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:42,840
Professor Gokhale sent me.

546
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:46,804
We are trying
to make a nation, Gandhi.

547
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:49,609
But the British keep trying
to break us up...

548
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:53,404
...into religions,
principalities, provinces.

549
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:56,598
What you were writing
in South Africa...

550
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:58,288
...that's what we need here.

551
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,645
I have so much to learn about India.

552
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:04,637
And I have to begin my practice again.
One needs money to run a journal.

553
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:08,086
Nonsense. Go on, Charlie.
This is Indian talk.

554
00:45:08,529 --> 00:45:11,123
We want none of you imperialists here.

555
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:14,961
All right, I'll go
and write my report to the viceroy.

556
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:17,519
You go and find a pretty Hindu woman...

557
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:19,561
...and convert her to Christianity.

558
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,443
That's as much mischief
as you're allowed.

559
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,397
Come, let's find a quiet corner.

560
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:30,202
Now, you forget about your practice.

561
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:32,406
You have other things to do.

562
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:36,639
India has many men
with too much wealth.

563
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:40,837
And it's their privilege to nourish
the effort of the few...

564
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:44,764
...who can raise India
from servitude and apathy.

565
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,608
I'll see to it.

566
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:48,328
You begin your journal.

567
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:49,764
I have little to say.

568
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:51,767
Come, let's sit down.

569
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:53,920
India is an alien country to me.

570
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:55,483
Change that.

571
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,798
Go and find India.

572
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:00,368
Not what you see here...

573
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:03,037
...but the real India.

574
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:05,998
You'll see what needs to be said...

575
00:46:06,649 --> 00:46:08,879
...what we need to hear.

576
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:17,398
When I saw you in that tunic, I knew.

577
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:22,122
I knew I could die in peace.

578
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,162
Make India proud of herself.

579
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:47,044
Charlie, please.
You're both being foolish.

580
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:50,207
But the air is lovely.
Anyway, there's no room in there.

581
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:52,838
Please! Come in.

582
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,768
No violence, please.

583
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:58,160
Let me hang on with two hands
or I will fall.

584
00:49:58,409 --> 00:49:59,637
Englishman, sahib!

585
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:01,687
Come, there is room up here!

586
00:50:04,529 --> 00:50:05,644
Put your foot on the window.

587
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:07,117
Come!

588
00:50:13,689 --> 00:50:16,840
- What are you doing?
- I'm going nearer to God.

589
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:20,648
Charlie! Be careful!

590
00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:22,966
Let go. Let go!

591
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:25,402
- Let go!
- Oh, dear!

592
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:38,519
Hello.

593
00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:43,282
You see?
It is most comfortable.

594
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:44,848
Sahib?

595
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:46,998
Are you a Christian?

596
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:49,362
Yes, I'm a Christian.

597
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:51,088
I know a Christian.

598
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:53,640
She drinks blood.

599
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:56,765
Blood of Christ. Every Sunday.

600
00:51:01,129 --> 00:51:01,925
Charlie!

601
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,240
It's all right, sahib.
It's very safe.

602
00:51:09,009 --> 00:51:10,237
Bend!

603
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:17,403
Pray to God, sahib.
Now is when it is best to be Hindu.

604
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:20,240
I agree with Jinnah.

605
00:51:20,729 --> 00:51:24,278
Now that the Americans are in,
the war will be over soon.

606
00:51:24,529 --> 00:51:26,838
The Germans are worn out as it is.

607
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:29,285
And our first act should be...

608
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:32,443
...to convene
a congress party convention...

609
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:35,045
...and demand independence.

610
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:38,326
And we will speak
with one voice, united.

611
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:41,562
And we should invite Gandhi.

612
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:43,481
What the devil's happened to him?

613
00:51:44,049 --> 00:51:45,767
He's discovering India.

614
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,608
Which is better than
making trouble where it matters.

615
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:51,682
Invite him, let him say his piece
about South Africa...

616
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:53,999
...then let him slip into oblivion.

617
00:52:22,969 --> 00:52:24,084
Insurgents.

618
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:25,927
They've derailed a troop train.

619
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:29,207
Keep clear!
Come on.

620
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:37,244
They've killed an English soldier.

621
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:47,482
<i>We were asked for toleration.</i>

622
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:50,642
We were asked for patience.

623
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:52,721
Some of us gave it...

624
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,005
...and some did not.

625
00:52:56,369 --> 00:52:58,724
Their war is over.

626
00:52:59,649 --> 00:53:02,004
And those of us who supported it...

627
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:04,638
...and those of us who refused...

628
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:08,086
...must forget our differences.

629
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:11,481
And there can be no excuses...

630
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,884
...from the British now.

631
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:15,926
India wants...

632
00:53:16,129 --> 00:53:17,482
...home rule.

633
00:53:17,729 --> 00:53:18,764
India...

634
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:20,920
...demands home rule!

635
00:53:36,729 --> 00:53:38,367
Congratulations.

636
00:53:48,569 --> 00:53:50,924
And let no one question...

637
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:53,040
...that Mr. Jinnah speaks...

638
00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:55,359
...not just for the Muslims...

639
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:56,598
...but for all India!

640
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:04,688
And now...

641
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:07,119
...l'm going to introduce to you...

642
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:09,206
...a man whose writings...

643
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:11,440
...we are all becoming familiar with.

644
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:15,608
A man who stood in high esteem
with our own beloved Gokhale.

645
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:20,081
A man whose accomplishments in
South Africa will always be remembered.

646
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:22,280
Mr. Mohandas Gandhi!

647
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:26,360
Your journal has made great impact.

648
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:28,799
I'm flattered by Mr. Patel.

649
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:31,961
I would be even more flattered
if what he said were true.

650
00:54:32,209 --> 00:54:33,358
But it is true.

651
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:35,884
I read it. Often!

652
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:50,685
Since I returned from South Africa...

653
00:54:52,649 --> 00:54:55,402
...l've travelled over much of India.

654
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:59,963
And I know that I could travel
for many more years...

655
00:55:00,249 --> 00:55:03,286
...and still only see
a small part of her.

656
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:06,039
And yet, I already know...

657
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:08,081
...that what we say here...

658
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:11,958
...means nothing to
the masses of our country.

659
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:15,959
Here, we make speeches
for each other...

660
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:20,568
...and those English liberal magazines
that may grant us a few lines.

661
00:55:23,169 --> 00:55:25,046
But the people of India...

662
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:26,517
...are...

663
00:55:27,209 --> 00:55:28,437
...untouched.

664
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:32,406
Their politics are confined to bread...

665
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,003
...and salt.

666
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:36,525
Illiterate they may be,
but they're not blind.

667
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:39,886
They see no reason to give their
loyalty to rich and powerful men...

668
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:43,127
...who simply want to take over
the role of the British...

669
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:45,081
...in the name of freedom.

670
00:55:46,729 --> 00:55:49,448
This congress tells the world...

671
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:51,719
...it represents India.

672
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:53,997
My brothers...

673
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:55,484
...lndia...

674
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:59,045
...is 700,000 villages...

675
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:02,047
...not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi...

676
00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:04,602
...and Bombay.

677
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:07,883
Until we stand in the fields...

678
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:11,843
...with the millions that toil
each day under the hot sun...

679
00:56:12,689 --> 00:56:15,726
...we will not represent India.

680
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:19,478
Nor will we ever be able
to challenge the British...

681
00:56:20,049 --> 00:56:21,687
...as one nation.

682
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:39,762
Have you read his magazine?

683
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:41,438
No.

684
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:43,682
But I think I'm going to.

685
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:49,488
Pull over.

686
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:51,202
This can't be the way.

687
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:54,959
Yes, I'm sure this is
the direction India is taking.

688
00:56:56,129 --> 00:56:58,802
To think I almost got
excited by Mr. Jinnah...

689
00:56:59,009 --> 00:57:01,000
...when all this was awaiting me.

690
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:21,121
We're looking for Mr. Gandhi.

691
00:57:24,089 --> 00:57:26,523
- You'll find him under that tree.
- Thank you.

692
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,844
I'm anxious to meet this new force.

693
00:57:30,289 --> 00:57:33,326
I try to live like an Indian,
as you see.

694
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:35,525
It's stupid, of course.

695
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:37,248
Because in our country...

696
00:57:37,449 --> 00:57:39,883
...it is the British who decide
how an Indian lives...

697
00:57:40,729 --> 00:57:42,879
...what he may buy, what he may sell.

698
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:44,807
And from their luxury...

699
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:48,644
...in the midst
of our terrible poverty...

700
00:57:49,529 --> 00:57:52,999
...they instruct us on
what is justice, what is sedition.

701
00:57:53,249 --> 00:57:57,083
So it's only natural
that our best young minds...

702
00:57:57,329 --> 00:58:00,048
...assume an air of Eastern dignity...

703
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:01,881
...while greedily assimilating...

704
00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:05,764
...every Western weakness as quickly
as they can acquire it.

705
00:58:08,969 --> 00:58:10,607
If we have home rule...

706
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:12,364
...that'll change.

707
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:17,159
Would you, please?

708
00:58:19,169 --> 00:58:21,683
Why should the British
grant us home rule?

709
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:26,037
We must take
the peelings to the goats.

710
00:58:26,609 --> 00:58:30,841
We only make wild speeches or
perform even wilder acts of terrorism.

711
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:32,648
We've bred an army of anarchists...

712
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:36,080
...but not one group that can
fight the British anywhere.

713
00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:38,126
Hello! Hello!

714
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:40,121
But I thought you were
against fighting.

715
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:43,406
Now just spread it around.

716
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:45,088
There you are.

717
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:48,964
They like the new peelings
mixed in with the rotting ones.

718
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:54,041
Where there's injustice,
I always believed in fighting.

719
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:58,444
The question is, do you fight
to change things or to punish?

720
00:58:58,649 --> 00:59:02,324
I've found we're all such sinners,
we should leave punishment to God.

721
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:05,083
And if we really want
to change things...

722
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:07,725
...there are better ways
of doing it...

723
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:11,200
...than derailing trains
or slashing someone with a sword.

724
00:59:11,409 --> 00:59:13,081
The fire is ready.

725
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:16,200
You see, even here...

726
00:59:17,369 --> 00:59:19,087
...we live under tyranny.

727
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:28,008
What did I tell you?
Look at him!

728
00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:30,998
I can see the British shaking now.

729
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:49,521
Hello!

730
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:52,488
I'm looking for Mr. Gandhi.

731
00:59:54,569 --> 00:59:57,925
I've been trying to speak
to you for a long time.

732
01:00:00,169 --> 01:00:01,682
Our crops.

733
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:03,601
We cannot sell them.

734
01:00:04,889 --> 01:00:06,208
We have no money.

735
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:09,408
But the landlords still
demand the same rent.

736
01:00:10,929 --> 01:00:13,284
We have nothing left.

737
01:00:54,649 --> 01:00:57,288
Mr. Taylor, sir. Up here!

738
01:01:09,089 --> 01:01:10,317
Jesus!

739
01:01:11,449 --> 01:01:13,201
What the hell is going on?

740
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:15,481
I don't know, sir.

741
01:01:20,289 --> 01:01:21,688
The agent got a telegram.

742
01:01:21,889 --> 01:01:25,484
And it just said, "He is coming,"
and gave the time of the train.

743
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:33,279
Who the hell is "he"?

744
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:35,359
I don't know, sir.

745
01:01:58,729 --> 01:02:00,526
Out of the way.
Come on, you!

746
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:09,202
- Who the devil are you?
- My name is Mohandas K. Gandhi.

747
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:11,127
Whoever you are,
we don't want you here.

748
01:02:11,889 --> 01:02:14,244
I suggest you get back on
that train before it leaves.

749
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:16,328
They seem to want me.

750
01:02:16,569 --> 01:02:17,558
Now, look here.

751
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:19,640
I'll put you under arrest
if you'd prefer.

752
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:21,764
On what charge?

753
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:27,482
I don't want any trouble.

754
01:02:27,689 --> 01:02:32,126
I'm an Indian travelling in my own
country. I see no reason for trouble.

755
01:02:34,649 --> 01:02:36,685
Well, there had better not be.

756
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:42,686
Make way for the officer.

757
01:03:01,329 --> 01:03:02,887
For years...

758
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:05,525
...the landlords have ordered us...

759
01:03:05,729 --> 01:03:07,003
...to grow indigo...

760
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:09,122
...for dyeing cloth.

761
01:03:09,969 --> 01:03:13,678
Always, they took part
of the crop as rent.

762
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:15,684
But now...

763
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:20,128
...everyone buys their cloth
from England.

764
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:21,478
So no one wants...

765
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:24,085
...our indigo.

766
01:03:24,649 --> 01:03:25,684
The landlords...

767
01:03:26,009 --> 01:03:28,648
...say we must pay our rent...

768
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,242
...in cash.

769
01:03:32,129 --> 01:03:33,482
What we could...

770
01:03:33,929 --> 01:03:35,487
...we sold.

771
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:38,402
The police have taken the rest.

772
01:03:39,209 --> 01:03:40,085
There is...

773
01:03:40,409 --> 01:03:42,479
...no food.

774
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:45,485
I understand.

775
01:03:47,849 --> 01:03:49,168
The landlords are British?

776
01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:01,080
What we can do, we will try to do.

777
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:21,444
Shukla...

778
01:04:22,009 --> 01:04:24,079
...is all Champaran like this?

779
01:04:24,729 --> 01:04:26,128
Yes, Bapu.

780
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:28,041
The whole region.

781
01:04:28,529 --> 01:04:29,644
Hundreds.

782
01:04:29,849 --> 01:04:30,725
Thousands.

783
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,599
Some landlords have tried to help.

784
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:37,886
But what can they do?

785
01:04:52,169 --> 01:04:54,842
- Are you Mr. M.K. Gandhi?
- Yes.

786
01:04:55,049 --> 01:04:57,005
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

787
01:04:57,849 --> 01:04:59,168
I'm not sorry at all.

788
01:05:09,129 --> 01:05:11,484
Who did you say
would be buying the drinks?

789
01:05:14,769 --> 01:05:16,202
Oh, no!

790
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:25,884
Wouldn't you know, that's the best
innings I've had since Oxford.

791
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:27,727
India's full of grief, old man.

792
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:28,885
I've got no idea.

793
01:05:29,129 --> 01:05:32,724
All I know is there's a riot or
something at Motihari in Champaran.

794
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:34,118
The whole company's ordered out.

795
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:53,007
I would like to see the prisoner.

796
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:06,082
On the left, sir.

797
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:17,122
Shades of South Africa.

798
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:18,404
Not quite.

799
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:20,282
They're only holding me...

800
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:22,525
...until the magistrate's hearing.

801
01:06:22,769 --> 01:06:24,680
Then it will be prison.

802
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:28,927
Did they take your clothes?

803
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:32,081
These are my clothes now.

804
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:36,961
You always had
a puritanical streak, Mohan.

805
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:39,441
If I want to be one with them...

806
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:41,328
...I have to live like them.

807
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:42,803
Yes, I think you do.

808
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:45,959
But thank God we all don't.

809
01:06:46,209 --> 01:06:48,086
My puritanism runs in a different way.

810
01:06:48,329 --> 01:06:50,206
I'm far too modest for such a display.

811
01:06:56,329 --> 01:06:59,287
Couldn't I be let in with
the prisoner? I am a clergyman.

812
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:13,802
They're calling you "Bapu."

813
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:15,647
I thought it meant "father."

814
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:17,688
It does.

815
01:07:18,649 --> 01:07:20,605
We must be getting old, Charlie.

816
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:24,968
What do you want me to do?

817
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:30,007
I think that you can help us most...

818
01:07:30,209 --> 01:07:33,485
...by taking that assignment
you've been offered in Fiji.

819
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:38,366
I have to be sure...

820
01:07:38,969 --> 01:07:40,925
They have to be sure
that what we do...

821
01:07:41,129 --> 01:07:44,246
...can be done by Indians alone.

822
01:07:55,569 --> 01:07:57,082
But you know the strategy.

823
01:07:57,289 --> 01:08:00,440
The world is full of people who
will despise what's happening here.

824
01:08:00,729 --> 01:08:02,321
It is their strength that we need.

825
01:08:02,529 --> 01:08:03,848
Before you go...

826
01:08:04,729 --> 01:08:07,880
...you could start us
in the right direction.

827
01:08:17,169 --> 01:08:19,000
I must leave from Calcutta...

828
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:21,681
...and soon.

829
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:25,921
Say goodbye to Ba for me.

830
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:31,684
Well, I...

831
01:08:33,369 --> 01:08:35,724
There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.

832
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:39,687
Wherever you are,
you will always be in my heart.

833
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,561
I'm going to clear the courtroom.

834
01:09:01,889 --> 01:09:03,083
I'm not sure we'd be able to.

835
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:05,519
It is a first hearing.
It's supposed to be public.

836
01:09:05,769 --> 01:09:07,487
And he's a lawyer.

837
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:10,287
I don't know where
they found the nerve.

838
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:13,447
I don't either, but the troops
won't be here till tomorrow.

839
01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:15,999
How did the press get here
before the military?

840
01:09:16,329 --> 01:09:18,889
That English clergyman sent
a number of telegrams yesterday.

841
01:09:19,129 --> 01:09:22,280
I understand one of them
even went to the viceroy.

842
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:36,966
You have been ordered
out of the province...

843
01:09:37,209 --> 01:09:39,643
...on the grounds
of disturbing the peace.

844
01:09:46,089 --> 01:09:48,080
With respect, I refuse to go.

845
01:09:50,849 --> 01:09:53,124
Do you want to go to jail?

846
01:09:53,369 --> 01:09:54,518
As you wish.

847
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:00,639
All right.

848
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:03,521
I will release you on bail...

849
01:10:03,769 --> 01:10:07,478
...of 1 00 rupees
until I reach a sentence.

850
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,405
I refuse to pay 1 00 rupees.

851
01:10:22,369 --> 01:10:24,246
Then I will grant release on bail...

852
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:28,084
...without payment
until I reach a decision.

853
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:54,358
Gandhiji! Gandhiji!

854
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:01,843
We are from Bihar.

855
01:11:02,369 --> 01:11:04,485
We received a cable
from an old friend...

856
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:06,327
...who was at Cambridge with us.

857
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:07,803
His name is Nehru.

858
01:11:08,049 --> 01:11:10,005
- I believe you know him.
- Indeed.

859
01:11:10,289 --> 01:11:13,520
He tells us you need help,
and we have come to give it.

860
01:11:15,489 --> 01:11:19,880
I want to document coldly, rationally,
what is being done here.

861
01:11:20,169 --> 01:11:21,397
It may take months.

862
01:11:21,649 --> 01:11:23,128
We have no pressing engagements.

863
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:25,883
You will have to live
with the peasants.

864
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,087
There will be risks.

865
01:11:46,289 --> 01:11:48,086
I don't know what
this country's coming to.

866
01:11:48,329 --> 01:11:49,318
But good God, man!

867
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:53,198
You yourself raised the rent simply
to finance a hunting expedition.

868
01:11:54,329 --> 01:11:57,560
And some of these others:
beatings, illegal seizures...

869
01:11:57,809 --> 01:11:59,765
...demanding services without pay.

870
01:12:00,009 --> 01:12:02,239
Even refusing them water.

871
01:12:02,769 --> 01:12:04,122
In India!

872
01:12:04,369 --> 01:12:06,803
Nobody knows what it is to try
to get these people to work.

873
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:09,080
You've made this half-naked
whatever-he-is...

874
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:10,842
...into an international hero.

875
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:15,762
"One lone man, marching dusty roads,
armed only with honesty...

876
01:12:16,009 --> 01:12:19,319
...and a bamboo staff, doing battle
with the British Empire."

877
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:22,686
At home, children are
writing essays about him.

878
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:26,883
What do they want?

879
01:12:27,129 --> 01:12:28,278
Gareth!

880
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:30,877
Yes, sir.

881
01:12:31,129 --> 01:12:33,199
There's a rebate on rents paid.

882
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,004
They're to be free to grow crops
of their own choice.

883
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:40,482
And a commission, part Indian,
to hear grievances.

884
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:46,607
That would satisfy him?

885
01:12:47,089 --> 01:12:48,522
And His Majesty's government.

886
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:51,803
It only needs your signature
for the landlords.

887
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:02,879
It'll be worth it
to see the back of him.

888
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:07,682
Thank you, sir.

889
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:11,608
- We're too damned liberal.
- Perhaps.

890
01:13:12,609 --> 01:13:16,488
At least this has made the government
see some sense about what men...

891
01:13:16,729 --> 01:13:20,165
...like Mr. Gandhi should be allowed,
and what they should be denied.

892
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:36,286
Where is Mr. Gandhi?

893
01:13:36,969 --> 01:13:39,199
He said he preferred to walk, sir.

894
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:43,078
I followed him most of the way.
He's just turned the corner.

895
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:45,480
He came third class.

896
01:13:46,329 --> 01:13:48,889
God, give me patience.

897
01:13:53,649 --> 01:13:55,401
My house is honoured.

898
01:13:55,649 --> 01:13:57,128
The honour is ours.

899
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:59,923
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Kallenbach, an old friend.

900
01:14:00,129 --> 01:14:04,088
He's interested in flowers. I told
him he could wander your garden.

901
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:07,402
I'll send for my gardener.
You'll have plenty to discuss.

902
01:14:07,649 --> 01:14:09,082
Thank you.

903
01:14:12,969 --> 01:14:15,403
Gentlemen, the hero of Champaran.

904
01:14:15,649 --> 01:14:17,879
Only the stubborn man of Champaran.

905
01:14:18,129 --> 01:14:20,120
Mr. Patel you know.

906
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:22,837
Maulana Azad, my colleague
and a fellow Muslim...

907
01:14:23,049 --> 01:14:25,768
...and just recently
released from prison.

908
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:28,888
Mr. Kripalani.

909
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:33,086
And of course, you know Mr. Nehru.

910
01:14:33,929 --> 01:14:36,079
I'm beginning to know Mr. Nehru.

911
01:14:36,329 --> 01:14:38,320
Please sit down. Do sit down.

912
01:14:38,569 --> 01:14:42,767
Gentlemen, I've asked you to come
here through Mr. Jinnah's kindness...

913
01:14:42,969 --> 01:14:45,688
...because I've had the chance
to see the legislation.

914
01:14:45,889 --> 01:14:47,959
And it is exactly as was rumoured.

915
01:14:48,369 --> 01:14:51,566
Arrest without warrant,
and automatic imprisonment...

916
01:14:51,769 --> 01:14:54,237
...for possession of materials
considered seditious.

917
01:14:54,649 --> 01:14:57,846
And your writings
are specifically listed.

918
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,280
So much for helping them
in the Great War.

919
01:15:00,489 --> 01:15:03,959
There is only one answer:
Direct action on a scale...

920
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:05,881
...they can never handle.

921
01:15:06,849 --> 01:15:08,248
I don't think so.

922
01:15:08,689 --> 01:15:12,079
Terrorism would only justify
their repression.

923
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:15,284
And what kind of leaders
would it throw up?

924
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:19,208
Are they men that we'd want
at the head of our country?

925
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:22,361
I too have read
Mr. Gandhi's writings...

926
01:15:22,609 --> 01:15:26,079
...but I'd rather be ruled by an
Indian terrorist than an English one.

927
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:28,564
And I don't intend to submit
to that kind of law.

928
01:15:28,769 --> 01:15:30,805
I must say, it seems to me...

929
01:15:31,049 --> 01:15:35,679
...that it's gone beyond remedies
like passive resistance.

930
01:15:36,529 --> 01:15:37,723
If I may...

931
01:15:37,929 --> 01:15:41,285
...l, for one, have never
advocated passive anything.

932
01:15:43,729 --> 01:15:44,559
I'm with Mr. Jinnah.

933
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:47,039
We must never submit to such laws...

934
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:48,683
...ever.

935
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:54,598
And I think our resistance must be
active and provocative.

936
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:57,758
May I?

937
01:15:59,969 --> 01:16:03,518
I want to embarrass all those
who wish to treat us as slaves.

938
01:16:05,169 --> 01:16:06,488
Thank you.

939
01:16:09,769 --> 01:16:11,282
All of them.

940
01:16:11,929 --> 01:16:14,079
- Forgive my stupid illustration.
- Allow me.

941
01:16:14,329 --> 01:16:15,921
No, please.

942
01:16:16,129 --> 01:16:18,165
But I want to change their minds...

943
01:16:18,369 --> 01:16:21,679
...not kill them
for weaknesses we all possess.

944
01:16:24,369 --> 01:16:26,644
And what resistance would you offer?

945
01:16:27,369 --> 01:16:30,884
The law is due
to take effect from April 6.

946
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:32,961
I want to call upon the nation...

947
01:16:33,209 --> 01:16:36,838
...to make that a day of
prayer and fasting.

948
01:16:37,089 --> 01:16:38,124
A general strike?

949
01:16:39,489 --> 01:16:42,003
I mean a day of prayer and fasting.

950
01:16:42,249 --> 01:16:45,559
Of course, no work could be done.
No buses.

951
01:16:46,529 --> 01:16:47,723
No trains.

952
01:16:47,969 --> 01:16:49,322
No factories.

953
01:16:49,569 --> 01:16:50,479
No administration.

954
01:16:52,249 --> 01:16:53,887
The country would stop.

955
01:16:55,289 --> 01:16:57,723
My God, it would terrify them!

956
01:16:58,569 --> 01:17:00,639
350 million people at prayer?

957
01:17:01,329 --> 01:17:03,923
Even the English newspapers
would have to report that...

958
01:17:04,289 --> 01:17:05,881
...and explain why.

959
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:08,563
- But could we get people to do it?
- Why not?

960
01:17:09,449 --> 01:17:11,679
Champaran stirred the whole country.

961
01:17:13,049 --> 01:17:14,687
Thank you.

962
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:17,000
They're calling you "Mahatma."

963
01:17:17,889 --> 01:17:19,288
"Great Soul."

964
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:24,282
Fortunately, such news comes
very slowly to where I live.

965
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:29,328
I think if we all worked
to publicize it...

966
01:17:29,569 --> 01:17:30,718
...all of congress...

967
01:17:31,289 --> 01:17:32,961
...every avenue we know...

968
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:37,487
I could get articles printed in most
of the papers in Delhi and Bombay.

969
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:50,687
Only civilians will visit.
Don't you think so, Your Highness?

970
01:17:50,889 --> 01:17:53,642
Of course, the army will
always be loyal.

971
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:56,602
I'll have you know,
we've got 500 troops.

972
01:17:59,769 --> 01:18:03,398
They'll be damn hungry by morning,
I'll tell you that.

973
01:18:10,129 --> 01:18:11,482
Mr. Kinnoch.

974
01:18:12,169 --> 01:18:14,046
Sir, I'm afraid it's confirmed.

975
01:18:15,089 --> 01:18:16,317
Nothing's working, sir.

976
01:18:16,569 --> 01:18:19,129
The buses, the trains, the markets.

977
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:22,128
There's not even any ordinary
civilian staff here, sir.

978
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:24,804
Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?

979
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:28,121
Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore.
It's total.

980
01:18:28,569 --> 01:18:30,287
The army had to take over
the telegraph...

981
01:18:32,529 --> 01:18:34,121
...or we'd be cut off from the world.

982
01:18:39,769 --> 01:18:41,327
I can't believe it.

983
01:18:41,529 --> 01:18:43,997
He's going to sell his own paper
tomorrow in Bombay, sir.

984
01:18:44,249 --> 01:18:47,480
They've called for a parade
on Victoria Road.

985
01:18:48,289 --> 01:18:49,119
Arrest him.

986
01:18:56,169 --> 01:18:58,478
He's to go to the visitors' room.

987
01:19:16,049 --> 01:19:17,164
Bapu.

988
01:19:18,169 --> 01:19:19,682
You too?

989
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:23,881
It seems less formal than Mahatma.

990
01:19:31,929 --> 01:19:35,126
Since your arrest,
the riots have hardly stopped.

991
01:19:35,769 --> 01:19:38,078
Not big, but they keep breaking out.

992
01:19:38,329 --> 01:19:39,762
I run to stop them.

993
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:44,482
And Patel and Kripalani,
they're never at rest.

994
01:19:45,569 --> 01:19:49,084
But some English civilians
have been killed.

995
01:19:51,969 --> 01:19:54,802
And the army is attacking
crowds with clubs.

996
01:19:56,649 --> 01:19:58,207
Sometimes worse.

997
01:20:03,849 --> 01:20:05,680
Maybe I'm wrong.

998
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:08,599
Maybe we're not ready yet.

999
01:20:09,769 --> 01:20:12,078
In South Africa,
our numbers were small.

1000
01:20:17,169 --> 01:20:20,286
The government's afraid.
They don't know what to do.

1001
01:20:20,969 --> 01:20:23,483
They're more afraid
of terrorism than of you.

1002
01:20:23,969 --> 01:20:28,121
The viceroy's agreed to your release
if you will speak for nonviolence.

1003
01:20:30,969 --> 01:20:33,642
I've never spoken for anything else.

1004
01:20:58,489 --> 01:20:59,717
England...

1005
01:21:00,049 --> 01:21:01,641
...is so powerful.

1006
01:21:02,489 --> 01:21:03,638
Its army...

1007
01:21:03,849 --> 01:21:04,998
...and its navy...

1008
01:21:05,769 --> 01:21:07,680
...all its modern weapons...

1009
01:21:08,769 --> 01:21:10,805
But when a great power like that...

1010
01:21:11,729 --> 01:21:13,720
...strikes defenceless people...

1011
01:21:14,489 --> 01:21:17,242
...it shows its brutality...

1012
01:21:17,489 --> 01:21:18,478
...its own weakness.

1013
01:21:18,729 --> 01:21:21,448
Especially when those people
do not strike back.

1014
01:21:49,249 --> 01:21:51,319
Fighting back will not work.

1015
01:21:51,569 --> 01:21:53,685
And that is why the Mahatma...

1016
01:21:54,529 --> 01:21:57,327
...begs us to take
the course of nonviolence.

1017
01:22:27,249 --> 01:22:29,888
Back away! Back away!

1018
01:22:39,169 --> 01:22:40,682
But if we riot...

1019
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,802
...if we fight back...

1020
01:22:44,569 --> 01:22:46,082
...we become the vandals...

1021
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:47,682
...and they become the law.

1022
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:53,086
If we bear their blows,
they are the vandals.

1023
01:22:54,289 --> 01:22:56,564
God and His law are on our...

1024
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:28,083
Front rank, kneel in position!

1025
01:23:31,249 --> 01:23:32,682
We...

1026
01:23:33,089 --> 01:23:35,319
...must have the courage...

1027
01:23:35,569 --> 01:23:37,685
...to take their anger.

1028
01:23:50,369 --> 01:23:52,121
Should we issue a warning, sir?

1029
01:23:54,369 --> 01:23:56,087
They've had their warning:

1030
01:23:56,889 --> 01:23:58,481
No meetings.

1031
01:24:02,369 --> 01:24:03,165
Fire!

1032
01:24:34,609 --> 01:24:36,645
Take your time!

1033
01:24:57,489 --> 01:24:58,604
Corporal!

1034
01:24:59,009 --> 01:25:00,328
To your left.

1035
01:25:46,889 --> 01:25:48,288
General Dyer...

1036
01:25:49,409 --> 01:25:52,048
...is it correct that you ordered
your troops to fire...

1037
01:25:52,249 --> 01:25:54,524
...at the thickest part of the crowd?

1038
01:25:55,089 --> 01:25:56,807
That is so.

1039
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:04,367
1 51 6 casualties with...

1040
01:26:05,889 --> 01:26:09,279
...1 650 bullets.

1041
01:26:09,689 --> 01:26:11,281
My intention was
to inflict a lesson...

1042
01:26:11,489 --> 01:26:14,447
...that would have an impact
throughout all India.

1043
01:26:19,569 --> 01:26:20,638
General...

1044
01:26:22,049 --> 01:26:25,837
...had you been able to
take in the armoured car...

1045
01:26:26,449 --> 01:26:28,804
...would you have opened fire
with the machine gun?

1046
01:26:33,089 --> 01:26:34,488
I think, probably, yes.

1047
01:26:37,849 --> 01:26:41,967
General, did you realize there were
children and women in the crowd?

1048
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:44,642
I did.

1049
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:48,163
But that was irrelevant
to the point you were making?

1050
01:26:48,409 --> 01:26:49,967
That is correct.

1051
01:26:56,289 --> 01:26:59,998
Could I ask you what provision
you made for the wounded?

1052
01:27:03,769 --> 01:27:06,078
I was ready to help any who applied.

1053
01:27:08,369 --> 01:27:11,008
General, how does a child...

1054
01:27:11,489 --> 01:27:13,923
...shot with a.303 Lee-Enfield...

1055
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,799
...apply for help?

1056
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:56,799
<i>Forgive me, gentlemen,
but you must understand...</i>

1057
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:01,840
...that His Majesty's government
and the British people repudiate...

1058
01:31:02,089 --> 01:31:06,207
...both the massacre and
the philosophy that prompted it.

1059
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:07,968
Now...

1060
01:31:08,169 --> 01:31:10,080
...what I would like to do...

1061
01:31:10,489 --> 01:31:14,721
...is to come to some compromise
over the new...

1062
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:17,318
If you will excuse me,
Your Excellency...

1063
01:31:17,569 --> 01:31:20,606
...it is our view that matters
have gone beyond legislation.

1064
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:22,801
We think it is time you recognized...

1065
01:31:23,049 --> 01:31:26,007
...that you are masters
in someone else's home.

1066
01:31:28,009 --> 01:31:30,125
Despite the best intentions
of the best of you...

1067
01:31:30,329 --> 01:31:34,208
...you must, in the nature of things,
humiliate us to control us.

1068
01:31:35,209 --> 01:31:38,997
General Dyer is but an extreme
example of the principle.

1069
01:31:40,009 --> 01:31:41,601
It is time you left.

1070
01:31:45,769 --> 01:31:47,919
With respect, Mr. Gandhi...

1071
01:31:48,209 --> 01:31:50,200
...without British administration...

1072
01:31:50,409 --> 01:31:52,365
...this country would be
reduced to chaos.

1073
01:31:52,689 --> 01:31:53,917
Mr. Kinnoch...

1074
01:31:56,009 --> 01:31:58,079
...I beg you to accept
that there is no people...

1075
01:31:58,329 --> 01:32:00,638
...who would not prefer
their own bad government...

1076
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:03,044
...to the good government
of an alien power.

1077
01:32:03,249 --> 01:32:05,922
My dear sir, India is British.

1078
01:32:06,169 --> 01:32:08,364
We're hardly an alien power.

1079
01:32:15,489 --> 01:32:20,244
Even if His Majesty could waive
all other considerations...

1080
01:32:20,489 --> 01:32:24,402
...he has a duty to the millions
of his Muslim subjects...

1081
01:32:24,649 --> 01:32:26,640
...who are a minority in this realm.

1082
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:30,120
And experience suggests
that his troops...

1083
01:32:30,369 --> 01:32:33,805
...and his administration
are essential...

1084
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:36,483
...in order to secure the peace.

1085
01:32:37,289 --> 01:32:40,486
All nations contain
religious minorities.

1086
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:43,681
Like other countries,
ours will have its problems.

1087
01:32:43,969 --> 01:32:45,561
But they will be ours...

1088
01:32:45,929 --> 01:32:47,044
...not yours.

1089
01:32:48,169 --> 01:32:50,160
How do you propose
to make them yours?

1090
01:32:51,209 --> 01:32:53,564
You don't think we're just
going to walk out of India.

1091
01:32:54,289 --> 01:32:55,085
Yes.

1092
01:32:56,249 --> 01:32:57,079
In the end...

1093
01:32:57,329 --> 01:32:58,728
...you will walk out...

1094
01:32:59,209 --> 01:33:02,599
...because 1 00,000 Englishmen
simply cannot control...

1095
01:33:02,809 --> 01:33:05,403
...350 million Indians
if those Indians refuse...

1096
01:33:05,649 --> 01:33:07,207
...to cooperate.

1097
01:33:07,409 --> 01:33:09,764
And that is what
we intend to achieve.

1098
01:33:10,009 --> 01:33:14,127
Peaceful, nonviolent
noncooperation...

1099
01:33:15,329 --> 01:33:17,889
...till you yourself
see the wisdom of leaving...

1100
01:33:18,609 --> 01:33:19,962
...Your Excellency.

1101
01:33:22,809 --> 01:33:25,562
I said to him, "You don't
expect us just to walk out."

1102
01:33:25,769 --> 01:33:27,566
And he said, "Yes."

1103
01:33:27,929 --> 01:33:30,397
What an extraordinary little man,
isn't he?

1104
01:33:30,609 --> 01:33:32,759
"Nonviolence, noncooperation."

1105
01:33:32,969 --> 01:33:35,847
For a moment, I was afraid they were
actually going to do something.

1106
01:33:36,089 --> 01:33:40,446
Yes, but I think it would be wise
to be very cautious for a time.

1107
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:43,363
The Antiterrorist Act
will remain on the statutes...

1108
01:33:43,569 --> 01:33:46,879
...but on no account
is Gandhi to be arrested.

1109
01:33:47,409 --> 01:33:49,479
Whatever mischief he causes...

1110
01:33:49,689 --> 01:33:52,601
...I have no intention
of making a martyr of him.

1111
01:33:56,489 --> 01:33:59,208
But now something worse is happening.

1112
01:33:59,409 --> 01:34:01,604
When Gandhiji and I were growing up...

1113
01:34:02,249 --> 01:34:04,968
...women wove their own cloth.

1114
01:34:06,009 --> 01:34:08,762
But now there are millions
who have no work...

1115
01:34:09,489 --> 01:34:14,199
...because those who can,
buy all they need from England.

1116
01:34:15,409 --> 01:34:17,525
I say with Gandhiji:

1117
01:34:18,169 --> 01:34:21,127
There is no beauty
in the finest cloth...

1118
01:34:21,369 --> 01:34:25,203
...if it makes hunger and unhappiness.

1119
01:34:55,169 --> 01:34:57,160
My message to you...

1120
01:34:58,009 --> 01:35:01,399
...is the message I have given
to your brothers everywhere.

1121
01:35:02,249 --> 01:35:04,479
To gain independence...

1122
01:35:04,889 --> 01:35:06,766
...we must prove worthy of it.

1123
01:35:08,089 --> 01:35:12,799
There must be
Hindu-Muslim unity always.

1124
01:35:18,089 --> 01:35:18,885
Second:

1125
01:35:20,049 --> 01:35:23,439
No Indian must be treated
as the English treat us.

1126
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:25,964
We must remove untouchability...

1127
01:35:26,169 --> 01:35:28,922
...from our hearts and from our lives.

1128
01:35:34,289 --> 01:35:35,563
Third:

1129
01:35:36,249 --> 01:35:38,809
We must defy the British.

1130
01:35:55,089 --> 01:35:59,162
Not with violence
that will inflame their will...

1131
01:36:00,369 --> 01:36:03,645
...but with a firmness that will
open their eyes.

1132
01:36:04,249 --> 01:36:06,763
English factories make the cloth...

1133
01:36:07,249 --> 01:36:09,365
...that makes our poverty.

1134
01:36:10,089 --> 01:36:12,967
All those who wish to
make the English see...

1135
01:36:13,529 --> 01:36:17,841
...bring me the cloth from Manchester
and Leeds that you wear today...

1136
01:36:18,289 --> 01:36:20,962
...and we will light a fire
that will be seen in Delhi...

1137
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:23,608
...and in London.

1138
01:36:24,089 --> 01:36:25,238
And if...

1139
01:36:25,929 --> 01:36:27,328
...like me...

1140
01:36:28,049 --> 01:36:31,086
...you are left with only
one piece of homespun...

1141
01:36:33,889 --> 01:36:36,005
...wear it with dignity.

1142
01:37:17,449 --> 01:37:19,360
Thank you very much.

1143
01:37:20,009 --> 01:37:21,965
No, thank you, I can manage.

1144
01:37:23,649 --> 01:37:25,287
Don't destroy my good intentions.

1145
01:37:25,529 --> 01:37:27,440
I'm already feeling guilty
about travelling second class.

1146
01:37:27,689 --> 01:37:29,486
You've earned a few indulgences.

1147
01:37:29,729 --> 01:37:32,243
Perhaps, but Maulana's made
of sterner stuff.

1148
01:37:32,489 --> 01:37:34,047
Our trains met in Bombay.

1149
01:37:34,249 --> 01:37:37,241
And there he is, back in
that lot, the model disciple.

1150
01:37:37,489 --> 01:37:39,286
There's another passenger.

1151
01:37:39,569 --> 01:37:43,164
A Miss Slade from London. She's
been writing to Gandhiji for years.

1152
01:37:43,449 --> 01:37:45,679
She's the daughter
of an English admiral.

1153
01:37:47,489 --> 01:37:49,241
What do you think the daughter
of an English admiral...

1154
01:37:49,449 --> 01:37:51,041
...proposes to do in our ashram?

1155
01:37:51,249 --> 01:37:54,161
- Sink us?
- From the looks of the luggage, yes.

1156
01:37:54,449 --> 01:37:57,839
She wants to make her home with us.
And Gandhiji has agreed.

1157
01:37:58,089 --> 01:37:59,602
Miss Slade!

1158
01:38:00,289 --> 01:38:01,802
You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.

1159
01:38:02,609 --> 01:38:05,123
And you would be Miss Slade?

1160
01:38:05,489 --> 01:38:07,844
I prefer the name
Gandhiji has given me:

1161
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:09,277
Mirabehn.

1162
01:38:15,009 --> 01:38:18,797
Don't pull it so fast.
You'll break it again.

1163
01:38:25,289 --> 01:38:28,406
Leave it. Leave it.

1164
01:38:28,689 --> 01:38:30,645
God gave you 1 0 thumbs.

1165
01:38:30,889 --> 01:38:32,004
Eleven.

1166
01:38:36,169 --> 01:38:37,807
Sardar!

1167
01:38:43,649 --> 01:38:45,287
Mirabehn!

1168
01:38:51,609 --> 01:38:53,201
Come, come.

1169
01:38:54,849 --> 01:38:56,999
You will be my daughter.

1170
01:38:58,889 --> 01:39:00,322
But then...

1171
01:39:00,569 --> 01:39:02,560
...some rioting broke out...

1172
01:39:02,769 --> 01:39:05,488
...between Hindus and Muslims.

1173
01:39:06,369 --> 01:39:08,803
Violent, terrible.

1174
01:39:10,249 --> 01:39:11,921
Whether it was provoked...

1175
01:39:12,409 --> 01:39:14,206
...I don't know.

1176
01:39:15,009 --> 01:39:18,763
But it gave them an excuse to impose
martial law throughout Bengal.

1177
01:39:20,449 --> 01:39:22,883
Some of the things
the military have done...

1178
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:25,205
Is the campaign weakening?

1179
01:39:25,489 --> 01:39:28,447
The marches and protests are bigger,
if anything.

1180
01:39:28,649 --> 01:39:30,480
But with the censorship here...

1181
01:39:31,209 --> 01:39:32,437
...they know more in England...

1182
01:39:33,049 --> 01:39:34,801
...than we do.

1183
01:39:35,009 --> 01:39:38,206
It saps the courage to think you
may be suffering alone.

1184
01:39:39,089 --> 01:39:40,602
They are not alone.

1185
01:39:41,089 --> 01:39:45,128
And martial law only shows
how desperate the British are.

1186
01:39:49,249 --> 01:39:51,399
Is that homespun?

1187
01:39:52,849 --> 01:39:54,999
I sent for it from here.

1188
01:39:55,369 --> 01:39:56,245
I dyed it myself.

1189
01:40:00,489 --> 01:40:02,559
What do the workers in England
make of what we're doing?

1190
01:40:02,969 --> 01:40:04,482
It must have produced hardship.

1191
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:06,008
It has...

1192
01:40:06,249 --> 01:40:08,843
...but you'd be surprised.
They do understand.

1193
01:40:09,049 --> 01:40:10,198
Good.

1194
01:40:13,209 --> 01:40:15,439
Ba will have to teach you
to spin too.

1195
01:40:15,689 --> 01:40:17,600
- I'd rather march.
- First, spin!

1196
01:40:19,089 --> 01:40:21,398
Let the others march for a time.

1197
01:40:22,289 --> 01:40:24,849
I'll teach you all our foolishness.

1198
01:40:25,089 --> 01:40:26,761
And you must teach me yours.

1199
01:40:34,889 --> 01:40:38,564
We burn British cloth!
We burn British cloth!

1200
01:40:45,129 --> 01:40:48,917
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1201
01:41:02,049 --> 01:41:05,883
British rule must go!
British rule must go!

1202
01:41:12,369 --> 01:41:14,405
I'll stuff it down your damn throat!

1203
01:41:16,089 --> 01:41:17,602
Help us!

1204
01:41:17,969 --> 01:41:20,039
Leave us alone!
We're not harming you.

1205
01:41:20,609 --> 01:41:22,327
Go on your way. On your way!

1206
01:41:23,289 --> 01:41:24,244
Come back!

1207
01:41:26,569 --> 01:41:28,525
Help us! Help us!

1208
01:41:31,089 --> 01:41:32,886
Help! Help!

1209
01:43:00,489 --> 01:43:02,798
That's one bit of news
they haven't censored.

1210
01:43:06,289 --> 01:43:08,439
Now it's all over the world.

1211
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:11,487
India's "nonviolence."

1212
01:43:13,489 --> 01:43:15,002
What can we do?

1213
01:43:15,569 --> 01:43:17,207
We must end the campaign.

1214
01:43:20,409 --> 01:43:23,845
After what they did at the massacre?
It's only an eye for an eye.

1215
01:43:24,089 --> 01:43:28,480
An eye for an eye only ends up
making the whole world blind.

1216
01:43:28,969 --> 01:43:31,278
Do you know the sacrifices
people have made?

1217
01:43:31,489 --> 01:43:33,764
We'd never get the same
commitment again, ever.

1218
01:43:33,969 --> 01:43:36,802
The whole of India is on the move!

1219
01:43:37,009 --> 01:43:39,159
Yes, but in what direction?

1220
01:43:39,449 --> 01:43:43,158
If we obtain our freedom by murder and
bloodshed, I want no part of it.

1221
01:43:46,689 --> 01:43:49,203
You are the father of the nation.

1222
01:43:49,449 --> 01:43:52,441
Today, I see no ground in that
for anything but shame.

1223
01:43:55,489 --> 01:43:57,923
This was one incident.

1224
01:43:58,169 --> 01:44:00,922
Tell that to the families of
the policemen who died.

1225
01:44:06,969 --> 01:44:09,722
The whole nation is marching.

1226
01:44:10,089 --> 01:44:13,081
They wouldn't stop,
even if we asked them to.

1227
01:44:15,489 --> 01:44:17,207
I will ask.

1228
01:44:17,809 --> 01:44:22,087
And I will fast as a penance
for my part in arousing such emotions.

1229
01:44:22,289 --> 01:44:24,803
And I will not stop until they stop.

1230
01:44:26,569 --> 01:44:27,604
But...

1231
01:44:28,009 --> 01:44:31,001
God! You can be sure
the British won't censor that.

1232
01:44:31,209 --> 01:44:33,200
They'll put it on every street corner.

1233
01:44:35,809 --> 01:44:38,164
People are aroused.

1234
01:44:38,369 --> 01:44:40,041
They won't stop!

1235
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:44,522
If I die, perhaps they will stop.

1236
01:45:22,289 --> 01:45:25,042
I must get ready for morning prayers.

1237
01:45:25,289 --> 01:45:27,200
Mirabehn is here.

1238
01:46:11,889 --> 01:46:14,005
I've brought your drinking water.

1239
01:46:26,289 --> 01:46:29,361
There's a little lemon juice in it.
That's all.

1240
01:46:41,649 --> 01:46:44,607
Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru.

1241
01:46:45,169 --> 01:46:46,887
There was a telegram.

1242
01:46:47,209 --> 01:46:50,042
Almost everywhere, it has stopped.

1243
01:46:50,449 --> 01:46:52,201
When it is everywhere...

1244
01:46:53,609 --> 01:46:56,169
...then my prayers will be answered.

1245
01:46:59,969 --> 01:47:02,005
Do you find me stubborn?

1246
01:47:02,809 --> 01:47:04,003
I don't know.

1247
01:47:04,969 --> 01:47:07,005
I know that you are right.

1248
01:47:07,449 --> 01:47:09,804
I don't know that this is right.

1249
01:47:12,289 --> 01:47:14,007
May I turn you?

1250
01:47:27,049 --> 01:47:29,085
When I despair...

1251
01:47:29,569 --> 01:47:32,925
...I remember that
all through history...

1252
01:47:33,769 --> 01:47:37,808
...the way of truth and love
has always won.

1253
01:47:39,689 --> 01:47:42,487
There have been tyrants
and murderers...

1254
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:46,648
...and, for a time,
they can seem invincible.

1255
01:47:46,849 --> 01:47:49,886
But in the end, they always fall.

1256
01:47:51,489 --> 01:47:52,842
Think of it.

1257
01:47:54,369 --> 01:47:56,007
Always.

1258
01:47:57,849 --> 01:48:01,159
Whenever you are in doubt that
that is God's way...

1259
01:48:01,369 --> 01:48:04,202
...the way the world is meant to be...

1260
01:48:04,409 --> 01:48:05,888
...think of that...

1261
01:48:07,249 --> 01:48:10,400
...and then try to do it His way.

1262
01:48:13,449 --> 01:48:17,806
And now, could I have
another feast of lemon juice?

1263
01:48:21,569 --> 01:48:23,002
Panditji!

1264
01:48:35,369 --> 01:48:36,245
Jinnah...

1265
01:48:37,089 --> 01:48:38,204
...Patel...

1266
01:48:38,769 --> 01:48:42,728
...all of congress has called
for the end of noncooperation.

1267
01:48:42,969 --> 01:48:46,484
There's not been one demonstration.

1268
01:48:47,449 --> 01:48:52,000
All over India, people are praying
that you will end the fast.

1269
01:48:52,449 --> 01:48:53,962
They're walking in the streets...

1270
01:48:54,169 --> 01:48:56,808
...offering garlands to the police...

1271
01:48:58,809 --> 01:49:00,162
...and British soldiers.

1272
01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:05,199
Perhaps I have overdone it.

1273
01:49:25,569 --> 01:49:28,083
- Good morning, Bapu.
- Good morning.

1274
01:49:28,369 --> 01:49:31,486
Don't let him go.
If he bumps me, I'm done for.

1275
01:49:31,689 --> 01:49:33,520
Don't worry, I won't let him go.

1276
01:50:01,169 --> 01:50:02,727
I'm sorry, Mr. Gandhi, sir...

1277
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:04,408
...but you're under arrest.

1278
01:50:04,729 --> 01:50:06,321
On what charge?

1279
01:50:06,569 --> 01:50:07,888
Sedition.

1280
01:50:08,369 --> 01:50:10,200
You can't be serious.

1281
01:50:10,569 --> 01:50:12,207
This man has just stopped
a revolution.

1282
01:50:12,449 --> 01:50:13,598
That's as may be.

1283
01:50:13,849 --> 01:50:15,646
I only know what
I am charged to perform.

1284
01:50:15,889 --> 01:50:17,242
I don't believe it!

1285
01:50:17,489 --> 01:50:19,764
Even the British can't be that stupid.

1286
01:50:20,649 --> 01:50:21,479
Help me, please.

1287
01:50:22,529 --> 01:50:25,282
Mira, you must look after Ba.

1288
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:33,648
If there is one protest, one riot,
a disgrace of any kind...

1289
01:50:33,849 --> 01:50:35,202
...I will fast again.

1290
01:50:35,529 --> 01:50:36,678
Herman.

1291
01:50:37,129 --> 01:50:39,165
I have been on many trips.

1292
01:50:39,729 --> 01:50:40,525
Monda.

1293
01:50:41,569 --> 01:50:43,446
This is just another trip.

1294
01:50:44,289 --> 01:50:46,086
I am at your command.

1295
01:50:51,449 --> 01:50:54,521
I know we are not ready
for my kind of independence.

1296
01:50:54,729 --> 01:50:57,766
If I'm sent to jail,
perhaps that is the best protest...

1297
01:50:57,969 --> 01:51:00,119
...our country can make at this time.

1298
01:51:01,089 --> 01:51:05,719
And if it helps India, I've never
refused His Majesty's hospitality.

1299
01:51:13,569 --> 01:51:15,639
Call the prisoner to the bar.

1300
01:51:59,769 --> 01:52:02,567
"Noncooperation has one aim:

1301
01:52:02,769 --> 01:52:04,885
The overthrow of the government.

1302
01:52:05,169 --> 01:52:07,478
Sedition must become our creed.

1303
01:52:08,049 --> 01:52:09,880
We must give no quarter...

1304
01:52:10,129 --> 01:52:12,882
...nor can we expect any."

1305
01:52:13,089 --> 01:52:15,239
- Do you deny writing it?
- Not at all.

1306
01:52:16,169 --> 01:52:18,000
And I will save the court's time...

1307
01:52:18,249 --> 01:52:20,638
...my lord, by stating
under oath that, to this day...

1308
01:52:20,889 --> 01:52:23,084
...I believe noncooperation
with evil is a duty...

1309
01:52:23,289 --> 01:52:25,484
...and that British rule
of India is evil.

1310
01:52:26,489 --> 01:52:28,957
The prosecution rests, my lord.

1311
01:52:32,929 --> 01:52:35,397
I presume you are conducting
your own defence.

1312
01:52:36,729 --> 01:52:39,289
I have no defence, my lord.
I am guilty as charged.

1313
01:52:39,889 --> 01:52:42,084
And if you truly believe
in your system of law...

1314
01:52:42,329 --> 01:52:46,845
...you must inflict on me
the severest penalty possible.

1315
01:52:57,569 --> 01:53:01,118
It is impossible for me to ignore
that you're in a different category...

1316
01:53:01,329 --> 01:53:04,207
...from any person
I have ever tried...

1317
01:53:05,009 --> 01:53:07,000
...or am likely to try.

1318
01:53:07,489 --> 01:53:09,878
Nevertheless, it is my duty
to sentence you...

1319
01:53:10,089 --> 01:53:13,718
...to six years' imprisonment.

1320
01:53:23,569 --> 01:53:27,403
lf, however, His Majesty's government
should, at some later date...

1321
01:53:28,129 --> 01:53:31,041
...see fit to reduce the term...

1322
01:53:33,289 --> 01:53:36,087
...no one will be
better pleased than I.

1323
01:54:02,689 --> 01:54:04,884
Yes, I'm sure that's exactly
what they hoped:

1324
01:54:05,169 --> 01:54:08,286
Put him in prison a few years.
With luck, he'd be forgotten.

1325
01:54:08,929 --> 01:54:10,920
Maybe they could even subdue him.

1326
01:54:11,769 --> 01:54:13,680
Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten.

1327
01:54:13,889 --> 01:54:16,244
And as soon as he got out,
he was back, tramping the countryside...

1328
01:54:16,449 --> 01:54:19,885
...preaching nonviolence and
demanding a free India.

1329
01:54:21,249 --> 01:54:24,082
Everyone knows
another showdown's coming.

1330
01:54:25,769 --> 01:54:28,237
How does an American journalist
in Central America...

1331
01:54:28,449 --> 01:54:31,088
...learn that Gandhi was born
in Porbandar anyway?

1332
01:54:31,449 --> 01:54:33,201
I've been aware of him
for a long time.

1333
01:54:33,409 --> 01:54:35,320
He certainly makes good copy.

1334
01:54:35,649 --> 01:54:40,086
The other day, Winston Churchill
called him a half-naked Indian fakir.

1335
01:54:41,729 --> 01:54:42,878
I met him once.

1336
01:54:43,129 --> 01:54:44,721
- What, you mean Gandhi?
- Yeah.

1337
01:54:44,969 --> 01:54:47,164
South Africa, a long time ago.

1338
01:54:47,649 --> 01:54:49,480
I wonder if he'll recognize me.

1339
01:54:49,729 --> 01:54:50,718
What was he like?

1340
01:54:50,969 --> 01:54:53,085
He had a full head of hair then.

1341
01:54:53,489 --> 01:54:56,287
We were a bit like college students,
trying to figure everything out.

1342
01:54:56,489 --> 01:54:59,208
Well, he must have found
some of the answers.

1343
01:55:05,449 --> 01:55:09,124
In every worthy wish of yours,
I shall be your helpmate.

1344
01:55:09,369 --> 01:55:11,280
Helpmate.

1345
01:55:12,369 --> 01:55:16,840
Take the fourth step,
that we may be ever full of joy.

1346
01:55:18,089 --> 01:55:20,444
I will ever live devoted to you...

1347
01:55:20,689 --> 01:55:25,080
...speaking words of love
and praying for your happiness.

1348
01:55:26,369 --> 01:55:28,599
Take the fifth step...

1349
01:55:28,849 --> 01:55:30,521
...the walking around a fire...

1350
01:55:33,049 --> 01:55:36,007
...that we may serve the people.

1351
01:55:36,249 --> 01:55:38,809
I will follow close behind you...

1352
01:55:39,009 --> 01:55:41,477
...and help to serve the people.

1353
01:55:43,129 --> 01:55:44,926
Take the sixth step...

1354
01:55:46,089 --> 01:55:49,479
...that we may follow
our vows in life.

1355
01:55:49,849 --> 01:55:54,081
I will follow you
in all our vows and duties.

1356
01:55:55,169 --> 01:55:57,205
Take the seventh step...

1357
01:55:59,969 --> 01:56:02,927
...that we may ever
live as friends.

1358
01:56:04,969 --> 01:56:07,483
You are my best friend...

1359
01:56:08,569 --> 01:56:10,480
...my highest guru...

1360
01:56:11,369 --> 01:56:13,678
...and my sovereign lord.

1361
01:56:17,649 --> 01:56:20,527
And then I put a sweetened
wheat cake in her mouth.

1362
01:56:20,769 --> 01:56:23,203
And I put a sweetened
wheat cake in his mouth.

1363
01:56:23,449 --> 01:56:25,883
And with that, we were pronounced...

1364
01:56:26,169 --> 01:56:27,682
...man and wife.

1365
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:32,283
We were both 1 3.

1366
01:56:44,129 --> 01:56:45,687
It's beautiful.

1367
01:56:47,169 --> 01:56:49,046
Even as a boy...

1368
01:56:49,249 --> 01:56:50,682
...I thought so.

1369
01:56:52,649 --> 01:56:54,082
Thank you.

1370
01:56:55,129 --> 01:56:58,280
Trying to keep up with you
is like chasing a jackrabbit.

1371
01:57:00,089 --> 01:57:03,638
You've come because you think
something is going to happen.

1372
01:57:04,929 --> 01:57:05,839
Is it?

1373
01:57:06,569 --> 01:57:07,888
Perhaps.

1374
01:57:08,769 --> 01:57:10,646
I've come here to think about it.

1375
01:57:14,289 --> 01:57:16,280
Do you remember much
of South Africa?

1376
01:57:16,489 --> 01:57:18,878
Oh, yes. A great deal.

1377
01:57:21,169 --> 01:57:22,966
I've travelled so far...

1378
01:57:23,569 --> 01:57:25,685
...and thought so much.

1379
01:57:29,729 --> 01:57:33,688
As you can see,
my city is a sea city.

1380
01:57:34,969 --> 01:57:37,199
Always full of Hindus...

1381
01:57:37,409 --> 01:57:38,888
...Muslims...

1382
01:57:39,089 --> 01:57:41,205
...Sikhs, Jews, Persians.

1383
01:57:43,569 --> 01:57:46,481
My family's sect was the Pranami.

1384
01:57:46,889 --> 01:57:48,117
Hindu, of course.

1385
01:57:48,329 --> 01:57:51,446
But in our temple,
the priest used to read...

1386
01:57:51,649 --> 01:57:53,799
...from the Muslim Koran...

1387
01:57:54,009 --> 01:57:56,728
...and the Hindu Gita,
moving from one to the other...

1388
01:57:56,929 --> 01:57:59,363
...as if it mattered not
which book was read...

1389
01:57:59,569 --> 01:58:01,366
...as long as God was worshipped.

1390
01:58:04,929 --> 01:58:06,123
When I was a boy...

1391
01:58:06,689 --> 01:58:08,725
...I used to sing a song
in the temple.

1392
01:58:12,089 --> 01:58:16,207
<i>A true disciple
Knows another's woes</i>

1393
01:58:16,409 --> 01:58:18,525
<i>As his own</i>

1394
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:20,158
He bows to all...

1395
01:58:20,369 --> 01:58:22,485
...and despises none.

1396
01:58:23,729 --> 01:58:24,844
Like all other boys...

1397
01:58:25,049 --> 01:58:26,528
...I sang the words...

1398
01:58:27,169 --> 01:58:31,082
...not thinking what they meant
or how they might influence me.

1399
01:58:34,529 --> 01:58:36,485
I've travelled so far.

1400
01:58:37,729 --> 01:58:40,084
And all I've done is come back...

1401
01:58:40,849 --> 01:58:42,077
...home.

1402
01:58:51,889 --> 01:58:52,685
Wait a minute.

1403
01:58:54,249 --> 01:58:55,728
You know what you're going to do,
don't you?

1404
01:58:55,969 --> 01:58:57,288
It would have been uncivil of me...

1405
01:58:57,489 --> 01:59:00,128
...to let you make
such a long trip for nothing.

1406
01:59:02,249 --> 01:59:04,080
- Where are you going?
- Come.

1407
01:59:05,849 --> 01:59:07,999
- Where are we going?
- Back to the ashram.

1408
01:59:08,249 --> 01:59:10,126
Then to prove to the new viceroy...

1409
01:59:10,369 --> 01:59:13,167
...that the king's writ
no longer runs in India.

1410
01:59:13,489 --> 01:59:14,478
Salt?

1411
01:59:14,689 --> 01:59:18,477
Yes, sir. He's going to march
to the sea and make salt.

1412
01:59:20,489 --> 01:59:23,720
There's a royal monopoly
on the manufacture of salt.

1413
01:59:23,929 --> 01:59:28,286
It's illegal to make it or sell it
without a government license.

1414
01:59:28,729 --> 01:59:30,845
All right, he's breaking the law.

1415
01:59:31,089 --> 01:59:34,240
What will that deprive us of?
Two rupees of salt tax?

1416
01:59:34,449 --> 01:59:35,928
It's not a serious attack
on the revenue.

1417
01:59:36,169 --> 01:59:38,967
Its primary importance is symbolic.

1418
01:59:39,169 --> 01:59:41,239
Don't patronize me, Charles.

1419
01:59:45,369 --> 01:59:48,520
In this climate, nothing lives
without water or salt.

1420
01:59:48,769 --> 01:59:52,682
Our absolute control of it is
a control on the pulse of India.

1421
01:59:53,489 --> 01:59:57,084
And that's the basis of
this declaration of independence?

1422
01:59:57,289 --> 01:59:58,483
The day he sets off...

1423
01:59:58,729 --> 02:00:02,563
...everyone is supposed to
raise the flag of "Free India."

1424
02:00:03,249 --> 02:00:07,765
And then he walks some 240 miles
to the sea and makes salt.

1425
02:00:11,849 --> 02:00:13,805
I say ignore it.

1426
02:00:14,049 --> 02:00:16,404
Let them raise their damned flags.

1427
02:00:16,649 --> 02:00:17,559
Let him make his salt.

1428
02:00:18,729 --> 02:00:21,687
It's only symbolic
if we choose to make it so.

1429
02:00:23,969 --> 02:00:25,561
He'll arrive at the sea...

1430
02:00:25,769 --> 02:00:28,761
...on the anniversary
of the Massacre of Amritsar.

1431
02:00:37,529 --> 02:00:39,918
General Edgar is right.
Ignore it.

1432
02:00:40,329 --> 02:00:43,048
Mr. Gandhi will find
it takes a great deal more...

1433
02:00:43,289 --> 02:00:46,918
...than a pinch of salt
to bring down the British Empire.

1434
02:01:38,969 --> 02:01:41,722
You've done me a great service.

1435
02:01:41,969 --> 02:01:43,118
Not at all, sir.

1436
02:01:43,369 --> 02:01:47,282
It would be uncivil of us to let you
make such a long trip for nothing.

1437
02:02:01,569 --> 02:02:02,718
We'll go.

1438
02:02:02,969 --> 02:02:06,405
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1439
02:02:28,089 --> 02:02:29,886
Is it over if they arrest you now?

1440
02:02:30,089 --> 02:02:31,158
Not if they arrest me...

1441
02:02:31,409 --> 02:02:33,718
...or 1 000 or 1 0,000.

1442
02:02:33,969 --> 02:02:37,723
It's not only generals
who know how to plan campaigns.

1443
02:02:38,369 --> 02:02:40,883
What if they don't arrest you?
What if they don't react at all?

1444
02:02:41,129 --> 02:02:42,357
Something for your notebook:

1445
02:02:42,769 --> 02:02:46,000
The function of a civil resister
is to provoke response.

1446
02:02:46,289 --> 02:02:47,927
And we will continue to provoke...

1447
02:02:48,129 --> 02:02:51,326
...until they respond
or they change the law.

1448
02:02:51,569 --> 02:02:54,561
They are not in control.
We are.

1449
02:02:55,169 --> 02:02:58,081
That is the strength
of civil resistance.

1450
02:03:02,569 --> 02:03:03,888
Vince!

1451
02:03:04,769 --> 02:03:08,239
- What did he say?
- He said he's in control.

1452
02:03:29,329 --> 02:03:31,285
Do you intend to walk all the way?

1453
02:03:31,529 --> 02:03:33,724
It's the only way
I can get the story.

1454
02:03:33,969 --> 02:03:36,278
Besides, my name is Walker.

1455
02:03:36,889 --> 02:03:39,084
"My name is Walker."

1456
02:04:31,049 --> 02:04:33,688
My dear Mrs. Nehru!

1457
02:05:25,929 --> 02:05:27,840
Man needs salt...

1458
02:05:28,049 --> 02:05:30,609
...as he needs air and water.

1459
02:05:31,129 --> 02:05:34,917
This salt comes
from the Indian Ocean.

1460
02:05:35,169 --> 02:05:38,878
Let every Indian claim it
as his right.

1461
02:05:40,369 --> 02:05:43,122
<i>And so, once more,
the man of nonviolence...</i>

1462
02:05:43,369 --> 02:05:46,486
<i>... has challenged the might
of the British Empire.</i>

1463
02:06:01,169 --> 02:06:04,002
They're making it everywhere, sir.
Mobs of them.

1464
02:06:04,249 --> 02:06:05,318
Publicly.

1465
02:06:05,569 --> 02:06:08,766
Congress leaders are selling it
on the streets of Delhi.

1466
02:06:09,289 --> 02:06:10,608
We're being made fools of, sir...

1467
02:06:10,849 --> 02:06:12,202
...around the world.

1468
02:06:12,449 --> 02:06:14,519
Isn't there any instruction
from London?

1469
02:06:14,769 --> 02:06:18,000
We're required to stop it.
And stop it we will!

1470
02:06:18,249 --> 02:06:20,558
I don't care if we fill the jails.
Stop it!

1471
02:06:21,569 --> 02:06:24,288
Arrest anyone, any rank,
except Gandhi.

1472
02:06:25,329 --> 02:06:27,445
We'll cut the strength
from under him.

1473
02:06:28,569 --> 02:06:31,766
And then we'll deal with the Mahatma.

1474
02:06:48,569 --> 02:06:51,037
Jump to it!
Clear this beach!

1475
02:07:25,089 --> 02:07:25,965
Don't hit back!

1476
02:07:26,209 --> 02:07:27,688
No violence!

1477
02:07:37,409 --> 02:07:41,527
There must be 1 00,000 under arrest.
And it still goes on.

1478
02:07:41,769 --> 02:07:44,727
- Who's leading them?
- I don't know. Nehru, Patel...

1479
02:07:44,929 --> 02:07:48,968
...most congress officials are in jail.
And their wives and children.

1480
02:07:49,209 --> 02:07:51,882
We've even arrested Nehru's mother.

1481
02:07:54,129 --> 02:07:56,006
Has there been any violence?

1482
02:07:56,249 --> 02:07:58,968
In Peshawar,
the deputy police commissioner...

1483
02:07:59,169 --> 02:08:02,286
...lost his head and opened fire
with a machine gun.

1484
02:08:03,449 --> 02:08:06,327
But he's facing disciplinary court.

1485
02:08:06,569 --> 02:08:08,605
You can't expect things
like that not to happen.

1486
02:08:08,809 --> 02:08:13,280
The question was intended to discover
if there was any violence on their side.

1487
02:08:15,969 --> 02:08:17,084
No, sir.

1488
02:08:17,329 --> 02:08:19,285
I'm afraid not.

1489
02:08:19,569 --> 02:08:23,278
Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi,
it might...

1490
02:08:26,449 --> 02:08:28,917
He's addressed this letter
directly to you, has he?

1491
02:08:29,129 --> 02:08:30,244
Yes, sir, he has.

1492
02:08:30,489 --> 02:08:31,604
The usual thing:

1493
02:08:31,809 --> 02:08:33,925
"India's salt belongs to India."

1494
02:08:34,169 --> 02:08:35,124
Then he says flatly...

1495
02:08:35,369 --> 02:08:39,521
...that he will lead a raid tomorrow
on the Dharasana Salt Works.

1496
02:08:40,769 --> 02:08:42,521
Thank him for his letter...

1497
02:08:42,929 --> 02:08:44,681
...and put him in jail.

1498
02:08:46,369 --> 02:08:47,165
Yes, sir.

1499
02:08:49,769 --> 02:08:51,327
It'll be my pleasure.

1500
02:08:51,569 --> 02:08:53,719
- And Fields?
- Sir?

1501
02:08:53,969 --> 02:08:56,278
Keep that salt works open.

1502
02:08:56,569 --> 02:08:58,287
Yes, sir.

1503
02:09:03,649 --> 02:09:04,638
I'm sorry, sir.

1504
02:09:04,849 --> 02:09:08,159
My orders are to allow regular staff
only through these gates.

1505
02:09:08,369 --> 02:09:09,688
Very well.

1506
02:09:11,649 --> 02:09:12,923
...in his name.

1507
02:09:13,129 --> 02:09:17,725
And for his sake,
we will not raise a hand.

1508
02:09:17,969 --> 02:09:21,006
Long live Mahatma Gandhi!

1509
02:09:23,169 --> 02:09:25,080
Long live Gandhiji!

1510
02:09:28,769 --> 02:09:30,487
We are ready!

1511
02:09:37,329 --> 02:09:39,320
I want firmness and discipline.

1512
02:09:58,729 --> 02:10:01,482
- All right, take up your positions.
- Yes, sir.

1513
02:10:08,129 --> 02:10:10,324
To your mark. Forward!

1514
02:10:20,569 --> 02:10:22,605
Last night at midnight...

1515
02:10:23,369 --> 02:10:24,927
...they took Gandhiji from us.

1516
02:10:26,369 --> 02:10:28,599
They expect us to lose heart...

1517
02:10:28,809 --> 02:10:30,447
...or to fight back.

1518
02:10:31,169 --> 02:10:33,239
We will do neither!

1519
02:11:03,369 --> 02:11:04,688
On your guard!

1520
02:11:20,849 --> 02:11:22,328
No, sir.
The gate is closed!

1521
02:12:38,329 --> 02:12:39,478
<i>"They walked...</i>

1522
02:12:40,009 --> 02:12:41,965
<i>... both Hindu and Muslim alike...</i>

1523
02:12:42,929 --> 02:12:44,806
<i>... with heads held high...</i>

1524
02:12:45,249 --> 02:12:47,046
<i>... without any hope of escape...</i>

1525
02:12:47,529 --> 02:12:49,247
<i>... from injury or death.</i>

1526
02:12:49,529 --> 02:12:52,680
It went on and on into the night."

1527
02:12:52,889 --> 02:12:53,844
Stop.

1528
02:12:54,049 --> 02:12:58,122
"Women carried the wounded
and broken bodies from the road...

1529
02:12:58,329 --> 02:13:00,718
...until they dropped
from exhaustion."

1530
02:13:00,929 --> 02:13:01,805
Stop.

1531
02:13:02,009 --> 02:13:05,365
"But still, it went on and on.

1532
02:13:07,089 --> 02:13:11,605
Whatever moral ascendancy
the West held...

1533
02:13:11,809 --> 02:13:13,606
...was lost here today.

1534
02:13:14,369 --> 02:13:16,360
<i>India is free...</i>

1535
02:13:16,569 --> 02:13:21,245
<i>... for she has taken all
that steel and cruelty can give...</i>

1536
02:13:21,449 --> 02:13:25,408
<i>... and she has neither
cringed nor retreated. "</i>

1537
02:14:32,969 --> 02:14:37,360
I am aware that I must have given
you much cause for irritation...

1538
02:14:37,569 --> 02:14:38,797
...Your Excellency.

1539
02:14:39,049 --> 02:14:41,927
I hope it will not stand
between us as men.

1540
02:14:46,289 --> 02:14:47,438
Mr. Gandhi...

1541
02:14:48,169 --> 02:14:51,366
...I am instructed to request
your attendance...

1542
02:14:51,569 --> 02:14:53,719
...at an all-government
conference in London...

1543
02:14:54,649 --> 02:14:59,325
...to discuss the possible
independence...

1544
02:14:59,529 --> 02:15:00,928
...of India.

1545
02:15:11,369 --> 02:15:13,644
<i>Only recently released from prison...</i>

1546
02:15:13,849 --> 02:15:17,637
<i>... Mahatma Gandhi leaves Bombay
on the SS Rajputana...</i>

1547
02:15:17,849 --> 02:15:20,568
<i>... to attend the conference
on Indian independence...</i>

1548
02:15:20,809 --> 02:15:24,882
<i>... called by Prime Minister
Ramsay MacDonald.</i>

1549
02:15:25,969 --> 02:15:28,881
<i>Mr. Gandhi, the sole
Indian Congress Party delegate...</i>

1550
02:15:29,129 --> 02:15:31,484
<i>... is staying at Kingsley Hall
in London's East End...</i>

1551
02:15:31,689 --> 02:15:33,281
<i>... for the duration of the talks.</i>

1552
02:15:33,729 --> 02:15:35,845
<i>He's seen here
amongst local cockneys...</i>

1553
02:15:36,049 --> 02:15:37,926
<i>... who have taken him
to their hearts.</i>

1554
02:15:38,169 --> 02:15:39,761
<i>Besides attending the conference...</i>

1555
02:15:39,969 --> 02:15:42,802
<i>... he has found time to meet
political and religious leaders...</i>

1556
02:15:43,009 --> 02:15:44,886
<i>... like Mr. Lloyd George...</i>

1557
02:15:45,129 --> 02:15:48,201
<i>... the Archbishop of Canterbury,
George Bernard Shaw...</i>

1558
02:15:48,409 --> 02:15:50,206
<i>... and Charlie Chaplin.</i>

1559
02:15:52,569 --> 02:15:54,844
<i>He journeyed last week
from Kingsley Hall...</i>

1560
02:15:55,049 --> 02:15:59,122
<i>... to accept an invitation to tea
from King George and Queen Mary...</i>

1561
02:15:59,329 --> 02:16:02,639
<i>... at Buckingham Palace
before attending the conference.</i>

1562
02:16:02,889 --> 02:16:06,279
And I would emphasize
that I think our first duty...

1563
02:16:06,489 --> 02:16:10,528
...is to recognize
that there is not one India...

1564
02:16:11,289 --> 02:16:12,642
...but several.

1565
02:16:13,369 --> 02:16:15,200
A Hindu India...

1566
02:16:15,449 --> 02:16:17,565
...a Muslim India...

1567
02:16:17,769 --> 02:16:20,237
...and an India of princely states.

1568
02:16:20,489 --> 02:16:23,208
And all these must be respected...

1569
02:16:23,409 --> 02:16:24,922
...and cared for.

1570
02:16:25,169 --> 02:16:26,488
Not just one.

1571
02:16:50,649 --> 02:16:52,401
<i>Mr. Gandhi, who has been attending...</i>

1572
02:16:52,649 --> 02:16:55,607
<i>... the London Round Table Conference
on Indian Independence...</i>

1573
02:16:55,809 --> 02:16:58,323
<i>... journeyed north
to visit a cotton mill.</i>

1574
02:16:58,849 --> 02:17:01,204
<i>Although not dressed
for the Lancashire climate...</i>

1575
02:17:01,409 --> 02:17:04,162
<i>... Mr. Gandhi received
a warm welcome from mill workers...</i>

1576
02:17:05,049 --> 02:17:06,528
<i>... before heading back south...</i>

1577
02:17:06,769 --> 02:17:09,237
<i>... for a final meeting
with Mr. MacDonald.</i>

1578
02:17:09,689 --> 02:17:14,319
<i>The prime minister said the talks
were both constructive and frank.</i>

1579
02:17:17,289 --> 02:17:19,564
<i>So farewell, Mr. Gandhi.</i>

1580
02:17:20,049 --> 02:17:22,279
<i>And bon voyage!</i>

1581
02:17:24,249 --> 02:17:26,604
<i>So the truth is,
after all your travels...</i>

1582
02:17:26,809 --> 02:17:28,401
<i>... after all your efforts...</i>

1583
02:17:28,649 --> 02:17:32,358
...they've stopped the campaign
and sent you back empty-handed.

1584
02:17:32,769 --> 02:17:35,920
They're only clinging
to old dreams...

1585
02:17:36,169 --> 02:17:38,888
...and trying to split us
in the old way.

1586
02:17:39,569 --> 02:17:41,287
But the will has gone.

1587
02:17:41,529 --> 02:17:44,441
Independence will fall
like a ripe apple.

1588
02:17:44,649 --> 02:17:47,117
The only question is, when and how.

1589
02:17:47,489 --> 02:17:49,207
Well, I say, when is now!

1590
02:17:51,369 --> 02:17:53,644
And we will determine how.

1591
02:17:53,889 --> 02:17:55,481
Precisely.

1592
02:17:55,889 --> 02:17:57,800
Bapu, she is limping again.

1593
02:17:58,289 --> 02:17:59,642
It's only a sprain.

1594
02:18:00,089 --> 02:18:03,320
Take her to the river.
We'll make a mud pack for her.

1595
02:18:04,569 --> 02:18:07,129
Go. I won't be a moment.

1596
02:18:10,569 --> 02:18:12,480
They are preparing for war.

1597
02:18:13,289 --> 02:18:14,517
I will not support it.

1598
02:18:14,729 --> 02:18:18,404
But I do not intend to take
advantage of their danger.

1599
02:18:18,649 --> 02:18:20,924
That's when you take advantage.

1600
02:18:21,249 --> 02:18:23,968
That is just another way
of hitting back.

1601
02:18:25,169 --> 02:18:27,205
We've come a long way together
with the British.

1602
02:18:27,409 --> 02:18:30,287
When they leave, we want to
see them off as friends.

1603
02:18:30,529 --> 02:18:35,284
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there is something I must attend to.

1604
02:18:41,289 --> 02:18:42,404
Mud packs.

1605
02:18:54,289 --> 02:18:56,120
Mr. Gandhi, sir.

1606
02:18:56,329 --> 02:18:59,844
I've been instructed to inquire as to
the subject of your speech tonight.

1607
02:19:00,049 --> 02:19:03,086
The value of goat's milk
in daily diet.

1608
02:19:05,049 --> 02:19:08,519
But you can be sure that
I will also speak against war.

1609
02:19:09,169 --> 02:19:10,682
Sorry, that can't be permitted.

1610
02:19:10,889 --> 02:19:11,878
Corporal!

1611
02:19:16,649 --> 02:19:17,843
It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi.

1612
02:19:18,089 --> 02:19:21,399
I have orders to return with you
and your companion to the ashram.

1613
02:19:22,129 --> 02:19:25,644
If you take my husband,
I intend to speak in his place.

1614
02:19:50,169 --> 02:19:51,887
Hold it a second, will you?

1615
02:19:53,449 --> 02:19:56,327
It was the Aga Khan's palace
before they turned it into a prison.

1616
02:19:56,569 --> 02:19:59,402
They're holding Gandhi
and congress politicians there.

1617
02:20:00,249 --> 02:20:03,605
Pandit Nehru and the others
are up at Ahmednagar Fort.

1618
02:20:05,329 --> 02:20:06,921
Not bad for a prison, eh?

1619
02:20:07,129 --> 02:20:09,518
I guess no place is good
if you're locked in.

1620
02:20:09,729 --> 02:20:11,685
Your timing's pretty lucky.

1621
02:20:11,929 --> 02:20:13,806
They had him cut off from the press.

1622
02:20:14,009 --> 02:20:17,638
But his personal secretary died,
so they let up on restrictions.

1623
02:20:22,569 --> 02:20:25,367
<i>Yes, I have heard of Life magazine.</i>

1624
02:20:25,609 --> 02:20:29,397
I've even heard of
Margaret Bourke-White.

1625
02:20:29,649 --> 02:20:33,403
But I don't know why either
should be interested in an old man...

1626
02:20:33,609 --> 02:20:35,964
...sitting alone in prison...

1627
02:20:36,209 --> 02:20:39,519
...while the rest of the world
is blowing itself to pieces.

1628
02:20:40,329 --> 02:20:43,878
Well, you're the only man I know
who makes his own clothes.

1629
02:20:46,049 --> 02:20:49,758
But for me, that's not
much of an accomplishment.

1630
02:20:55,449 --> 02:20:59,203
No, prison is rather agreeable to me.

1631
02:20:59,529 --> 02:21:02,999
And there is no doubt that
after the war...

1632
02:21:03,249 --> 02:21:05,319
...independence will come.

1633
02:21:05,649 --> 02:21:06,718
My only worry...

1634
02:21:06,929 --> 02:21:09,284
...is what shape it will take.

1635
02:21:09,529 --> 02:21:11,201
- Jinnah has...
- Stop!

1636
02:21:11,729 --> 02:21:14,926
I'm sorry, but...
Could you come forward, please?

1637
02:21:15,569 --> 02:21:17,685
- Come, come.
- Just up to the railing.

1638
02:21:17,929 --> 02:21:19,442
Thank you very much.

1639
02:21:21,769 --> 02:21:23,088
Now, sorry.

1640
02:21:23,289 --> 02:21:25,405
Go on. "What shape it will take..."

1641
02:21:25,609 --> 02:21:27,042
Jinnah has what?

1642
02:21:28,649 --> 02:21:32,119
Jinnah has cooperated with the British.

1643
02:21:32,329 --> 02:21:36,368
It has given him power
and the freedom to speak.

1644
02:21:36,609 --> 02:21:39,043
And he's filled
the Muslims with fears...

1645
02:21:39,289 --> 02:21:41,359
...of what will happen to them...

1646
02:21:41,569 --> 02:21:44,402
...in a country that
is predominantly Hindu.

1647
02:21:45,089 --> 02:21:47,887
And that I find hard to bear...

1648
02:21:48,129 --> 02:21:49,721
...even in prison.

1649
02:21:49,929 --> 02:21:51,567
Mr. Gandhi?

1650
02:21:57,369 --> 02:22:01,760
It's hard for me to see this as a
cure for the 20th century's problems.

1651
02:22:02,489 --> 02:22:04,957
I have friends who keep telling me...

1652
02:22:05,169 --> 02:22:08,957
...how much it costs them
to keep me in poverty.

1653
02:22:10,649 --> 02:22:15,120
But I know happiness
does not come with things...

1654
02:22:15,369 --> 02:22:16,927
...even 20th century things.

1655
02:22:17,169 --> 02:22:21,640
It can come from work
and pride in what you do.

1656
02:22:22,609 --> 02:22:25,407
India lives in her villages...

1657
02:22:25,649 --> 02:22:28,402
...and the terrible poverty there
can only be removed...

1658
02:22:28,609 --> 02:22:31,840
...if their local skills
can be revived.

1659
02:22:32,249 --> 02:22:35,127
Poverty is the worst form
of violence.

1660
02:22:35,849 --> 02:22:38,158
And a constructive program
is the only...

1661
02:22:38,369 --> 02:22:41,520
...nonviolent solution
to India's agony.

1662
02:22:42,209 --> 02:22:44,769
It will not necessarily be
progress for India...

1663
02:22:44,969 --> 02:22:49,087
...if she simply imports
the unhappiness of the West.

1664
02:22:51,609 --> 02:22:54,999
Do you really believe you could
use nonviolence against Hitler?

1665
02:22:56,929 --> 02:23:00,046
Not without defeats and great pain.

1666
02:23:01,209 --> 02:23:03,769
But are there no defeats in this war?

1667
02:23:04,449 --> 02:23:05,325
No pain?

1668
02:23:07,049 --> 02:23:08,482
What you cannot do...

1669
02:23:08,729 --> 02:23:11,289
...is accept injustice
from Hitler or anyone.

1670
02:23:11,489 --> 02:23:14,481
You must make the injustice visible.

1671
02:23:14,689 --> 02:23:18,159
Be prepared to die
like a soldier to do so.

1672
02:23:21,449 --> 02:23:24,122
Is this what I'm meant to
end up with here?

1673
02:23:25,569 --> 02:23:27,560
That's what you get
for distracting me.

1674
02:23:27,769 --> 02:23:29,760
What do you expect
when you talk like that?

1675
02:23:29,969 --> 02:23:34,360
I expect you to show
as much patience as I am now.

1676
02:23:35,249 --> 02:23:38,400
Turn slowly and pull it gently.

1677
02:23:43,649 --> 02:23:46,322
And that includes the life of women.

1678
02:23:46,969 --> 02:23:49,642
Bapu has always said...

1679
02:23:49,849 --> 02:23:52,568
...there were two kinds
of slavery in India:

1680
02:23:52,969 --> 02:23:56,564
One for women,
one for the untouchables.

1681
02:23:57,089 --> 02:24:00,240
And he has always fought against both.

1682
02:24:02,849 --> 02:24:05,966
Does it rankle,
being separated in this way?

1683
02:24:09,449 --> 02:24:11,599
In Hindu philosophy...

1684
02:24:12,409 --> 02:24:13,808
...the way to God...

1685
02:24:14,009 --> 02:24:16,648
...is to free yourself
of possessions...

1686
02:24:17,569 --> 02:24:18,922
...and of passions.

1687
02:24:19,809 --> 02:24:24,007
Bapu has always struggled
to find the way to God.

1688
02:24:27,609 --> 02:24:31,602
Do you mean that
he gave up married life?

1689
02:24:34,129 --> 02:24:36,723
Four times he tried...

1690
02:24:37,449 --> 02:24:38,848
...and failed.

1691
02:24:40,529 --> 02:24:42,440
But then he took a solemn vow.

1692
02:24:45,169 --> 02:24:46,318
And he's never broken it?

1693
02:24:49,729 --> 02:24:50,844
Not yet.

1694
02:25:08,049 --> 02:25:11,246
- I've got permission to move her.
- I'm very sorry, sir.

1695
02:25:11,449 --> 02:25:14,168
She's had a massive thrombosis.
It's a serious heart attack.

1696
02:25:14,409 --> 02:25:15,922
She'll never survive the trip.

1697
02:25:16,129 --> 02:25:18,962
It's better if we just
keep her here and hope.

1698
02:26:04,569 --> 02:26:07,288
It's time for my walk.

1699
02:26:09,609 --> 02:26:11,122
I won't be long.

1700
02:28:23,449 --> 02:28:24,245
Guard...

1701
02:28:24,689 --> 02:28:26,645
...present arms!

1702
02:28:41,849 --> 02:28:45,683
We have come to crown victory
with friendship.

1703
02:28:47,729 --> 02:28:50,801
To assist at the birth of
an independent India...

1704
02:28:51,049 --> 02:28:52,482
...and to welcome her
as an equal member...

1705
02:28:52,689 --> 02:28:54,998
...in the British Commonwealth
of Nations.

1706
02:28:56,249 --> 02:28:59,127
I am here to see that I am
the last British viceroy...

1707
02:28:59,329 --> 02:29:03,004
...ever to have the honour
of such a reception.

1708
02:29:14,969 --> 02:29:17,608
I am not concerned about
the independence of India.

1709
02:29:17,849 --> 02:29:19,965
I'm concerned about
the slavery of Muslims.

1710
02:29:20,209 --> 02:29:22,200
Please, Mr. Jinnah.

1711
02:29:22,449 --> 02:29:24,917
I won't watch the mastery
of the British...

1712
02:29:25,129 --> 02:29:27,324
...replaced by
the mastery of the Hindus.

1713
02:29:33,569 --> 02:29:37,448
Muslim and Hindu are the right
and left eye of India.

1714
02:29:38,009 --> 02:29:40,682
No one will be master, no one slave.

1715
02:29:40,929 --> 02:29:43,124
The world is not made of
Mahatma Ghandis.

1716
02:29:43,369 --> 02:29:44,961
I'm talking about the real world.

1717
02:29:45,209 --> 02:29:46,722
- How the...
- The real India has...

1718
02:29:46,969 --> 02:29:50,678
...Muslims and Hindus
in every village and every city.

1719
02:29:52,049 --> 02:29:53,323
How will you separate them?

1720
02:29:53,849 --> 02:29:56,761
Where there is a Muslim majority...

1721
02:29:57,089 --> 02:29:58,807
...that will be Pakistan.

1722
02:29:59,049 --> 02:30:01,517
The rest is your India.

1723
02:30:01,729 --> 02:30:02,684
My dear Jinnah...

1724
02:30:03,289 --> 02:30:07,043
...the Muslims are in a majority
on two different sides of the country.

1725
02:30:07,289 --> 02:30:11,168
Let us worry about Pakistan.
You worry about India.

1726
02:30:11,409 --> 02:30:12,444
Gentlemen...

1727
02:30:12,689 --> 02:30:14,725
...I think perhaps
we should recommence.

1728
02:30:28,409 --> 02:30:32,038
Death to Jinnah!
Death to Jinnah!

1729
02:30:58,409 --> 02:31:00,320
Thank God, they've stopped.

1730
02:31:03,649 --> 02:31:05,367
Manu. Abha.

1731
02:31:12,849 --> 02:31:14,328
I'm your granduncle...

1732
02:31:14,569 --> 02:31:17,766
...but I can still walk
either of you into the ground.

1733
02:31:17,969 --> 02:31:20,358
I don't need to be pampered
in this way.

1734
02:31:20,569 --> 02:31:22,719
Finish your quota of spinning.

1735
02:32:05,449 --> 02:32:07,121
Bapu, please don't do it.

1736
02:32:07,329 --> 02:32:09,923
What do you want me not to do?

1737
02:32:10,209 --> 02:32:12,165
Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?

1738
02:32:13,889 --> 02:32:15,800
I am a Muslim...

1739
02:32:16,129 --> 02:32:17,084
...and a Hindu...

1740
02:32:17,609 --> 02:32:19,600
...and a Christian and a Jew.

1741
02:32:20,409 --> 02:32:22,764
And so are all of you.

1742
02:32:24,849 --> 02:32:27,522
When you wave those flags and shout...

1743
02:32:27,849 --> 02:32:30,886
...you send fear into the hearts
of your brothers.

1744
02:32:31,089 --> 02:32:33,000
That is not the India I want.

1745
02:32:33,249 --> 02:32:34,284
Stop it!

1746
02:32:34,529 --> 02:32:37,362
For God's sake, stop it.

1747
02:32:54,209 --> 02:32:55,881
If you've finished your prayers...

1748
02:32:56,089 --> 02:32:58,762
...perhaps we could begin
our business.

1749
02:33:02,849 --> 02:33:05,682
My dear Jinnah...

1750
02:33:05,929 --> 02:33:08,682
...you and I are brothers...

1751
02:33:08,889 --> 02:33:12,928
...born of the same mother India.
If you have fears...

1752
02:33:13,129 --> 02:33:16,087
...I want to put them at rest.

1753
02:33:16,329 --> 02:33:19,162
Begging the understanding
of my friends...

1754
02:33:19,689 --> 02:33:23,125
...I am asking Panditji
to stand down.

1755
02:33:23,569 --> 02:33:27,403
I want you to be
the first prime minister of India...

1756
02:33:27,609 --> 02:33:30,442
...to name your entire cabinet...

1757
02:33:30,649 --> 02:33:34,324
...to make the head of every
government department a Muslim.

1758
02:33:52,209 --> 02:33:54,279
For me and the rest...

1759
02:33:54,529 --> 02:33:56,565
...if that is what you want...

1760
02:33:56,769 --> 02:33:58,964
...we will accept it.

1761
02:34:00,089 --> 02:34:02,239
But out there...

1762
02:34:02,969 --> 02:34:04,527
...already there is rioting...

1763
02:34:04,729 --> 02:34:08,688
...because Hindus fear you are
going to give too much away.

1764
02:34:09,449 --> 02:34:11,440
If you did this...

1765
02:34:12,049 --> 02:34:14,404
...no one would control it.

1766
02:34:14,969 --> 02:34:16,368
No one.

1767
02:34:31,449 --> 02:34:33,041
It is your choice.

1768
02:34:34,369 --> 02:34:38,362
Do you want an independent India
and an independent Pakistan...

1769
02:34:38,729 --> 02:34:41,118
...or do you want civil war?

1770
02:35:16,449 --> 02:35:19,327
Jinnah! Jinnah! Jinnah!

1771
02:37:46,329 --> 02:37:49,685
What you did in Noakhali, Bapu,
was a miracle.

1772
02:37:50,089 --> 02:37:51,568
Miracle.

1773
02:37:52,049 --> 02:37:54,244
But millions are on the move...

1774
02:37:54,449 --> 02:37:56,485
...and no one can count the dead.

1775
02:37:58,649 --> 02:38:02,358
In Calcutta, it's like civil war.

1776
02:38:04,049 --> 02:38:07,519
The Muslims rose
and there was a bloodbath.

1777
02:38:08,569 --> 02:38:10,844
Now the Hindus are taking revenge.

1778
02:38:12,209 --> 02:38:13,642
If we can't stop it...

1779
02:38:13,849 --> 02:38:16,807
...there'll be no hope
for the Hindus left in Pakistan.

1780
02:38:18,009 --> 02:38:20,921
An eye for an eye,
making the whole world blind.

1781
02:38:23,169 --> 02:38:24,682
Aren't there any troops to spare?

1782
02:38:26,289 --> 02:38:27,199
Nothing.

1783
02:38:30,969 --> 02:38:32,197
Nothing.

1784
02:38:36,409 --> 02:38:39,207
The divisions in Bombay and Delhi
can hardly keep the peace now.

1785
02:38:39,449 --> 02:38:43,647
And each fresh bit of news creates
another wave of madness.

1786
02:38:43,849 --> 02:38:46,079
We could cut all news off.

1787
02:38:46,649 --> 02:38:48,162
Bapu, please, where are you going?

1788
02:38:48,729 --> 02:38:50,162
I don't want to hear more.

1789
02:38:51,569 --> 02:38:53,241
We need your help.

1790
02:38:53,769 --> 02:38:56,078
There is nothing I can give.

1791
02:38:59,009 --> 02:39:00,203
Where are you going?

1792
02:39:03,449 --> 02:39:04,723
Calcutta.

1793
02:39:46,249 --> 02:39:50,162
If I had shunned death or feared it,
I would not be here now...

1794
02:39:50,369 --> 02:39:52,325
...nor would you be concerned for me.

1795
02:39:52,529 --> 02:39:54,406
But, sir, please.

1796
02:39:54,649 --> 02:39:56,958
I don't have the men to protect you...

1797
02:39:57,169 --> 02:39:59,808
...not in a Muslim house,
not this quarter.

1798
02:40:00,009 --> 02:40:03,001
I'm staying with the friend
of a friend and...

1799
02:40:03,209 --> 02:40:06,997
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1800
02:40:08,449 --> 02:40:10,519
Why are you staying
at the home of a Muslim?

1801
02:40:10,769 --> 02:40:11,884
They are murderers!

1802
02:40:12,129 --> 02:40:13,278
They killed my family!

1803
02:40:13,529 --> 02:40:15,406
Get out of Calcutta, Gandhi!

1804
02:40:15,609 --> 02:40:18,282
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1805
02:41:05,089 --> 02:41:06,204
Prime Minister.

1806
02:41:11,009 --> 02:41:13,762
Why must I read news
like this in the paper?

1807
02:41:18,649 --> 02:41:21,117
Inform Sardar Patel.
Arrange a plane.

1808
02:41:21,649 --> 02:41:22,764
We will go Friday.

1809
02:41:23,649 --> 02:41:24,684
Four days, sir?

1810
02:41:57,129 --> 02:41:59,563
Sardar, you have gained weight.

1811
02:41:59,809 --> 02:42:01,925
You must join me in the fast.

1812
02:42:02,129 --> 02:42:04,438
If I fast, I die.

1813
02:42:05,049 --> 02:42:09,042
If you fast, people go to
all sorts of trouble...

1814
02:42:09,249 --> 02:42:10,398
...to keep you alive.

1815
02:42:11,729 --> 02:42:13,287
Bapu, forgive me, I've cheated.

1816
02:42:13,849 --> 02:42:15,885
I could have come earlier...

1817
02:42:16,089 --> 02:42:18,444
...but your fast has helped.

1818
02:42:19,009 --> 02:42:22,558
These last days, people's minds
have begun to turn to this bed...

1819
02:42:22,809 --> 02:42:24,720
...and away from the atrocities.

1820
02:42:24,929 --> 02:42:25,759
But now...

1821
02:42:26,809 --> 02:42:27,798
...it is enough.

1822
02:42:30,369 --> 02:42:34,487
All that has happened is that
I've grown a little thinner.

1823
02:42:38,009 --> 02:42:41,479
Tomorrow, 5000 Muslim students...

1824
02:42:41,689 --> 02:42:42,838
...of all ages...

1825
02:42:43,089 --> 02:42:46,638
...are marching here,
in Calcutta, for peace.

1826
02:42:47,329 --> 02:42:50,799
And 5000 Hindu students
are marching with them.

1827
02:42:51,849 --> 02:42:53,567
I'm glad.

1828
02:42:54,369 --> 02:42:57,167
But it will not be enough.

1829
02:43:12,209 --> 02:43:15,485
You are not so young anymore.

1830
02:43:15,929 --> 02:43:17,408
Don't worry for me.

1831
02:43:18,729 --> 02:43:23,166
I cannot watch the destruction
of all that I've lived for.

1832
02:44:29,609 --> 02:44:31,088
Death to Gandhi!

1833
02:44:31,369 --> 02:44:33,564
Who dares say such things?!

1834
02:44:33,929 --> 02:44:35,157
Who?!

1835
02:44:36,409 --> 02:44:39,048
You kill me first!

1836
02:44:40,049 --> 02:44:41,164
Come!

1837
02:44:43,929 --> 02:44:45,282
Where are you?!

1838
02:44:46,169 --> 02:44:47,841
Kill me first!

1839
02:44:50,649 --> 02:44:51,923
Where are you?

1840
02:45:01,969 --> 02:45:05,439
His pulse is very irregular.
The kidneys aren't functioning.

1841
02:45:20,329 --> 02:45:22,968
I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.

1842
02:45:23,249 --> 02:45:26,958
It was he who called
on the Muslims to rise.

1843
02:45:27,249 --> 02:45:28,682
He is now telling them...

1844
02:45:29,209 --> 02:45:31,598
...to go back to their homes...

1845
02:45:31,849 --> 02:45:33,680
...to lay down their arms.

1846
02:45:45,649 --> 02:45:47,719
Think what you can do by living...

1847
02:45:48,049 --> 02:45:51,041
...that you cannot do by dying.

1848
02:46:00,249 --> 02:46:02,524
What do you want?

1849
02:46:05,809 --> 02:46:08,482
That the fighting will stop.

1850
02:46:08,689 --> 02:46:11,123
That you make me believe...

1851
02:46:13,929 --> 02:46:16,648
...that it will never start again.

1852
02:46:25,609 --> 02:46:26,724
Sometimes...

1853
02:46:26,929 --> 02:46:30,524
...it is when you are
quite without hope...

1854
02:46:31,209 --> 02:46:34,167
...and in utter darkness...

1855
02:46:34,849 --> 02:46:37,921
...that God comes to the rescue.

1856
02:46:39,729 --> 02:46:41,082
Gandhiji...

1857
02:46:41,529 --> 02:46:43,042
...is dying...

1858
02:46:44,849 --> 02:46:47,409
...because of our madness.

1859
02:46:49,249 --> 02:46:51,717
Put away your revenge.

1860
02:46:52,049 --> 02:46:56,406
What good will come of more killing?

1861
02:46:56,649 --> 02:46:58,879
Have the courage to do...

1862
02:46:59,089 --> 02:47:02,365
...what you know is right.

1863
02:47:02,849 --> 02:47:04,680
For God's sake...

1864
02:47:05,289 --> 02:47:09,123
...let us embrace like brothers.

1865
02:47:22,449 --> 02:47:24,167
It's our promise.

1866
02:47:24,889 --> 02:47:26,083
We stop.

1867
02:47:28,649 --> 02:47:30,526
Hindu swords.

1868
02:47:31,809 --> 02:47:33,367
It's a promise.

1869
02:47:36,409 --> 02:47:37,762
Go.

1870
02:47:39,449 --> 02:47:40,802
God be with you.

1871
02:47:53,249 --> 02:47:54,648
Here, eat!

1872
02:47:56,089 --> 02:47:56,999
Eat!

1873
02:47:58,649 --> 02:48:00,128
I'm going to hell...

1874
02:48:00,529 --> 02:48:03,089
...but not with your death on my soul.

1875
02:48:03,649 --> 02:48:06,846
Only God decides who goes to hell.

1876
02:48:07,209 --> 02:48:09,006
I killed a child.

1877
02:48:10,569 --> 02:48:13,242
I smashed his head against a wall.

1878
02:48:14,929 --> 02:48:16,157
Why?

1879
02:48:18,249 --> 02:48:19,967
They killed my son.

1880
02:48:22,929 --> 02:48:24,248
My boy.

1881
02:48:26,449 --> 02:48:28,599
The Muslims killed my son!

1882
02:48:33,329 --> 02:48:36,878
I know a way out of hell.

1883
02:48:38,169 --> 02:48:40,478
Find a child.

1884
02:48:40,769 --> 02:48:45,559
A child whose mother and father
have been killed.

1885
02:48:45,929 --> 02:48:50,161
A little boy about this high...

1886
02:48:51,769 --> 02:48:54,329
...and raise him as your own.

1887
02:48:57,809 --> 02:49:01,006
Only be sure that he is a Muslim...

1888
02:49:02,729 --> 02:49:05,766
...and that you raise him as one.

1889
02:49:32,369 --> 02:49:33,165
Go.

1890
02:49:34,529 --> 02:49:35,325
Go.

1891
02:49:37,329 --> 02:49:38,808
God bless you.

1892
02:50:04,449 --> 02:50:05,359
<i>Bapu?</i>

1893
02:50:11,729 --> 02:50:13,924
There's been no fighting...

1894
02:50:14,529 --> 02:50:15,484
...anywhere.

1895
02:50:16,849 --> 02:50:18,248
It's stopped.

1896
02:50:19,009 --> 02:50:21,477
The madness has stopped.

1897
02:50:25,409 --> 02:50:26,922
It's foolish...

1898
02:50:27,129 --> 02:50:30,599
...if it's just to save
the life of an old man.

1899
02:50:30,849 --> 02:50:35,639
No. In every temple and mosque...

1900
02:50:36,009 --> 02:50:38,000
...they have pledged to die...

1901
02:50:38,249 --> 02:50:41,127
...before they lift a hand
against each other.

1902
02:50:43,529 --> 02:50:45,201
It is true, Bapu.

1903
02:50:53,049 --> 02:50:54,767
Everywhere.

1904
02:51:28,009 --> 02:51:30,239
Maulana, my friend...

1905
02:51:32,209 --> 02:51:34,643
...could I have some orange juice?

1906
02:51:41,249 --> 02:51:42,841
Then you and I...

1907
02:51:43,049 --> 02:51:45,802
...will take a piece
of bread together.

1908
02:52:14,809 --> 02:52:16,925
He will be saying prayers
in the garden.

1909
02:52:25,049 --> 02:52:26,801
<i>That is how you eat muli.</i>

1910
02:52:27,649 --> 02:52:30,163
I'm not sure that I want
to be remembered that way.

1911
02:52:30,369 --> 02:52:32,405
Don't worry.
With luck, you may not be.

1912
02:52:32,609 --> 02:52:36,079
No, he will be remembered
for tempting fate.

1913
02:52:37,209 --> 02:52:38,961
Mickey Mouse!

1914
02:52:40,129 --> 02:52:42,040
You're really going to Pakistan?

1915
02:52:46,729 --> 02:52:48,526
You are a stubborn man.

1916
02:52:50,529 --> 02:52:52,406
I'm simply going to prove...

1917
02:52:52,609 --> 02:52:55,077
...to Hindus here and Muslims there...

1918
02:52:55,329 --> 02:52:58,401
...that the only devils
in the world are those...

1919
02:52:58,649 --> 02:53:01,004
...running around in our own hearts.

1920
02:53:01,569 --> 02:53:04,879
And that is where all our battles
ought to be fought.

1921
02:53:12,209 --> 02:53:16,805
So, what kind of warrior have you
been in that warfare?

1922
02:53:18,369 --> 02:53:20,041
Not a very good one.

1923
02:53:20,249 --> 02:53:22,843
That's why I have
so much tolerance...

1924
02:53:23,049 --> 02:53:26,166
...for the other scoundrels
of the world.

1925
02:53:30,409 --> 02:53:31,285
Sardar?

1926
02:53:32,169 --> 02:53:35,525
Ask Panditji to consider
what we've discussed.

1927
02:53:41,729 --> 02:53:43,845
- Enough!
- One more.

1928
02:53:44,169 --> 02:53:46,763
- You're a temptress!
- Just an admirer.

1929
02:53:47,009 --> 02:53:49,045
Nothing's more dangerous...

1930
02:53:49,289 --> 02:53:51,359
...especially for an old man.

1931
02:54:00,449 --> 02:54:02,565
There's a sadness about him.

1932
02:54:04,049 --> 02:54:05,562
He thinks he's failed.

1933
02:54:05,809 --> 02:54:07,162
Why?

1934
02:54:07,409 --> 02:54:10,719
If anything's proven him right,
it's these last months.

1935
02:54:12,369 --> 02:54:14,803
I may be blinded by my love for him...

1936
02:54:15,529 --> 02:54:16,757
...but I believe...

1937
02:54:17,009 --> 02:54:19,079
...when we most needed it...

1938
02:54:19,289 --> 02:54:22,326
...he offered the world
a way out of madness.

1939
02:54:24,929 --> 02:54:26,203
But he doesn't see it.

1940
02:54:27,129 --> 02:54:28,960
Neither does the world.

1941
02:55:01,089 --> 02:55:03,159
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

1942
02:55:05,849 --> 02:55:07,567
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1943
02:55:08,329 --> 02:55:10,206
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1944
02:55:47,329 --> 02:55:49,240
<i>When I despair...</i>

1945
02:55:49,529 --> 02:55:51,360
<i>... I remember...</i>

1946
02:55:51,689 --> 02:55:53,839
<i>... that all through history...</i>

1947
02:55:54,049 --> 02:55:58,361
<i>... the way of truth and love
has always won.</i>

1948
02:56:00,129 --> 02:56:03,565
<i>There have been tyrants
and murderers...</i>

1949
02:56:03,809 --> 02:56:06,721
<i>... and for a time,
they can seem invincible...</i>

1950
02:56:06,929 --> 02:56:10,205
<i>... but in the end, they always fall.</i>

1951
02:56:11,849 --> 02:56:13,328
<i>Think of it.</i>

1952
02:56:15,009 --> 02:56:16,567
<i>Always.</i>
