1
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:22,667
Oh, thank you, Arnold.
I can manage that.

2
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:27,673
But I still don't see why you couldn't
wait a couple of weeks.

3
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:29,732
Why go all the way up to Loki?

4
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,110
To hear Grace Makanga speak,
and she won't be coming to Nairobi.

5
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:36,240
I see.

6
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:39,308
Oh, sweetheart, don't bother
to see us off. It could be ages.

7
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:42,981
Okay, well—

8
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:45,388
It's too hot to be standing around.
If you're sure.

9
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:49,385
Bye.
Bye, Arnold.

10
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,800
Let me take your bag for you.
Thank you.

11
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:56,859
Bye, sweetheart.

12
00:00:56,937 --> 00:00:59,269
See you in, uh— in a couple of days.

13
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,862
Sandy, he's here.

14
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:04,427
Hi. Come in. Oh, hi, Sandy.
You caught me skiving, I'm afraid.

15
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:08,898
How's Gloria? Well?
Gloria's fine.

16
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:10,960
You haven't heard from Tessa,
I suppose?

17
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:14,529
No, she's, uh, up north
with, um, Arnold Bluhm.

18
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:19,003
Look, old chap, do you think you could
stop doing that a moment?

19
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:22,505
Something wrong?

20
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:25,210
She didn't say anything
about returning by road?

21
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:27,219
From Loki?

22
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:31,553
Well, that wouldn't surprise me,
knowing Tessa. I mean, I hope not.
Dangerous country.

23
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,559
What is it, Sandy?

24
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:38,064
We're getting reports
of a white woman, black driver,

25
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:45,162
Found early this morning,
southern end of Lake Turkana,

26
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:48,230
Dead—killed, it seems.

27
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:54,844
You think it might be Tessa?

28
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:59,181
Seems they hired a car and driver
in Loki and then headed east.

29
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,879
They spent the night at Lodwar.

30
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:10,852
They shared a room, Justin.

31
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:15,596
The dead black isn't Arnold Bluhm.

32
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,329
Most terribly sorry.

33
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,670
And how sure are you?

34
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:31,008
It's not looking good.

35
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:47,266
It's...

36
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:49,495
Good of you to tell me, Sandy.

37
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,196
Can't have been easy.

38
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:10,614
Diplomacy, therefore,
as we've demonstrated,

39
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,821
Is the very map and marker
of civilization,

40
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:20,491
Pointing nations the safest way
through country...

41
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,535
Fraught with peril.

42
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:24,536
And that's it.

43
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:30,042
Uh, Sir Bernard Pellegrin has asked me
to convey his, uh, regrets...

44
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,341
That he's been unable to deliver
his lecture in person.

45
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,405
And I thank you on my own behalf
for your very kind attention.

46
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:38,883
Thank you.

47
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,882
Excuse me. Excuse me.

48
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:45,220
Yeah? Yeah, sorry.
Excu— Excuse me.

49
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:49,921
Sir, I've just got one question.
I just wondered whose map,
um, is Britain using...

50
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:53,932
When it completely ignores the United Nations
and decides to invade Iraq?

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
Or do you— do you think...

52
00:05:56,636 --> 00:06:02,040
It's more diplomatic to bend
to the will of a superpower...

53
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:06,545
And—and politely take part
in Vietnam, the sequel?

54
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:14,215
Well, uh, l— I can't speak
for Sir Bernard—

55
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:17,188
Oh, I thought that's
why you were here.

56
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:20,715
I mean, diplomats have
to go where they're sent.

57
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:22,853
So do Labradors.
Ooh.

58
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:25,261
- Ouch.

59
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,731
Well, I think that, no, Sir Bernard
would no doubt argue...

60
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:32,636
That when, um, peaceful means
are exhausted, then—
Exhausted?

61
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:35,641
Mr. Quayle, they're not exactly
exhausted, are they?

62
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,975
I mean, they're just— they're just—
No, they are just lying
in the way of the tanks.

63
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:43,482
No, l-l-let's face it.
We've taken 60 years...

64
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,283
To build up this international organization
called the United Nations,

65
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,345
Which is meant to avoid wars,

66
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:54,723
- and now we just blow it up
because our car's running out of petrol.
- Sit down, Tessa, for Christ's sake.

67
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,921
- L— I think—
- Hold on a minute.
Let's see what he says.

68
00:06:56,996 --> 00:07:00,090
I think the questioner
is making a valid point,
and that a nation's foreign policy...

69
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,431
- should not be determined
by narrow commercial interests.
- That's bullshit.

70
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,664
That's bullshit.
You have to take responsibility.

71
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:10,938
You are being paid to apologize
for this pathetic country of Britain,

72
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,343
And he can explain to us why we've burned
our diplomatic credentials...

73
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:18,350
And why we're killing, you know,
thousands of innocent people...

74
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,182
Just for—just for some barrels of oil...

75
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:23,449
And a photo opportunity
on the White House lawn.

76
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,514
Why?

77
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:55,312
Are you all right?
Yes, thanks.

78
00:07:57,357 --> 00:08:00,986
You were courageous.
No. No, I was completely rude.

79
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,861
- It was just bad behavior, and l—
- You were impassioned.

80
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:08,093
I'm so embarrassed. Sorry.

81
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:10,329
Please don't be embarrassed.
I'm really sorry.

82
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:20,679
And, uh, thanks very much.
You... tried to protect me.

83
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:24,342
Very feebly.
No, you were—you were—
You weren't feeble. I just—

84
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,476
Anyway, it was a very dull lecture.

85
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:28,521
It was a dull lecture,
but even so I shouldn't have—

86
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:31,682
Well, look, can l—
can I buy you a coffee or—

87
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:34,420
I owe you a drink. Come on.
All right.
You can buy me a drink.

88
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:37,258
I'm Justin, by the way.
Tessa. How do you do?

89
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,321
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah, yeah.
Pleased to meet you.

90
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,391
- You were quite scary,
but I don't blame you.

91
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:44,459
It was absolute bollocks,

92
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,267
So you're quite right to challenge—

93
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,673
I'm rather nervous,
I have to confess.

94
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:53,109
Me too. This way.

95
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,773
Oh, do come in.

96
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,283
Yeah, please. Of course.

97
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:01,286
Thank you.
You lead the way.

98
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,288
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take a left.
All right.

99
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,191
Wriggle.

100
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:34,081
There we go.

101
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:42,486
Thank you.

102
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:46,931
For... this wonderful gift.

103
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,161
How very generous of me.

104
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,861
No, l—

105
00:09:57,176 --> 00:10:00,805
You—You're so—

106
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:05,779
You know what I mean.
I know what you mean.

107
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:09,185
I feel safe with you.

108
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:12,281
I can imagine when you were six.

109
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:14,349
You leading the revolution.

110
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:16,793
No. No, I was very conventional.

111
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:18,797
Here, Justin, put this on.

112
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:24,336
Mr. Quayle? Please.

113
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:52,554
Please.

114
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:18,415
Know this lady, sir?

115
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:26,393
Yes, I do. It's, uh—

116
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:28,866
It's my wife, Tessa.

117
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:42,004
Sandy.

118
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:49,120
Come on.

119
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:27,816
Tessa.

120
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,727
My God, what a surprise.

121
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:35,694
How'd you get in?

122
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,759
Take me to Africa with you.

123
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:40,772
What? Roll you up in a rug?

124
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,831
Pack you in a tea chest?
Very funny.

125
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:45,844
I'd have to smuggle you in
as illicit goods.

126
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,403
I couldn't declare you.

127
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:51,314
Oh, listen. I could put you
in one of these plant boxes, and—

128
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:55,650
You'd be very comfortable
wrapped up in a little piece of, uh—

129
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,985
I could label you. "Tessa."

130
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:01,416
I'm serious.

131
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:08,030
Um, yeah, I can see you are.

132
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:16,804
And in what—what capacity
should I take you to Africa?

133
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:22,007
I don't mind. You can take me
as your mistress, lover, wife.

134
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:24,743
There's too much choice.

135
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:29,212
L—Well, I'm—

136
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,823
I'm flattered
that you would like—
No. No.

137
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:37,829
Justin, please don't
say that sentence.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

138
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:40,195
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's really—

139
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,791
Just yes or no?

140
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:45,895
Well, we—we hardly know
one another. I mean—

141
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:47,837
You can learn me.

142
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:50,501
Learn you?
Mmm.

143
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:58,812
Yes or no?

144
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,046
Then l—

145
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:11,379
Oh.
A gift.

146
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,925
Oh, thank you.

147
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,587
Thank you.

148
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:21,094
Thank you so much.
It's beautiful.

149
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,000
- Hey.
- Arnold.

150
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:29,303
That's so nice.

151
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,639
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

152
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:34,441
They made it for me.

153
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:15,380
Hey, Mr. Bluhm.!

154
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:18,951
Careful.

155
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,757
Ooh. Take my hand.

156
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,495
What did you give her, Arnold?

157
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:32,833
Nevirapine. The government clinic
didn't have any again.

158
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:34,964
Jomo.
Yes, Mama Tessa?

159
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,635
Have you had your test yet?

160
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,701
No.
Jomo.

161
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,339
If she's H. I. V. Positive,
chances are you are too.

162
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:44,349
Look, Dr. Bluhm, I really must go.

163
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,544
We can talk about this later.
Thank you.
Take you 10 minutes.

164
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:50,385
- Woodrow is very particular about time.
I will be in trouble. Bye.
- I'll see you later.

165
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,022
Jesus!

166
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,694
You shouldn't be
wandering around in this heat.

167
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,761
Arnold, stop fussing.
You're as bad as Justin.

168
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,569
If you were my wife,
I'd tie you to the bed.

169
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,974
Then what would you do, Doctor?

170
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:14,035
That's another story.

171
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:16,741
Tell me what you'd do.
Hey!

172
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,435
All right.

173
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:02,392
Now, for the first time,

174
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:05,294
We are exploring a new territory.

175
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:08,822
This is a new discovery...

176
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,699
For the famous marine biologist—

177
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:13,762
Jacques Cousteau.

178
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,239
You are a voyeur.

179
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:19,175
It's fantastic.

180
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:21,406
Now we are going down, down, down.

181
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,607
Oh, what do we have here?

182
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:26,242
Zoom.!

183
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:30,618
Wipe it.
I must keep this new discovery
for posterity...

184
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:34,625
And admire the new person inside.

185
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,854
You have to go wipe this.
Go and wipe it.

186
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:39,830
Wipe it right now.
No, I can't wipe it.
I'm completely inept with computers.

187
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,301
- I'm gonna keep it.
I'm sorry. I love it.

188
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,703
Will you see who that's from,
darling?
Sure.

189
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:04,687
What is it?
What?

190
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:07,282
The e-mail.

191
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,350
Oh, it's, um—

192
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:11,692
It's just junk— some ad.

193
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:15,165
- For?
- For the Nairobi Hilton.

194
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,498
Oh, my boobs hurt.

195
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,903
Would you, uh, mind, uh—

196
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:23,965
Weekend package deal.

197
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:27,706
Two nights for the price of one.
Mmm. Two guests
for the price of one.

198
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,408
Sweetheart, would you come
and make yourself useful?

199
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,476
Yeah, I'm coming.

200
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:02,273
My darling. Sweetheart,
I'd like you to put this up
right in the middle.

201
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,181
Right?
Yeah.

202
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:07,515
So, um—

203
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,713
Right there.
Mm-hmm.

204
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:11,779
What do you think?
I think it's gorgeous.

205
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:13,848
I think it's very tangled.
No, no, no.

206
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:15,917
I meant— I meant
about a weekend at the Hilton.

207
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,555
Oh, no. It's a bit flashy
for my taste.
Is it?

208
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:22,567
Mm-hmm.
Oh. I wouldn't know.
L— I've never been there.

209
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:26,435
Well, I have. I was there the other night
meeting someone with Arnold.

210
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:31,007
Oh, well, just a thought.

211
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,444
Sweetheart.

212
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,953
Were you just inviting me away
for a dirty weekend at the Hilton?

213
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:46,617
Mm-hmm.
Were you?

214
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,683
I would love to,

215
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:52,424
But maybe after... Arturo is born.
Oh, Tessa.

216
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,625
We're not calling him
Arturo, please.

217
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,998
Why not?
No. Not— Not Arturo...

218
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,060
Or Giuseppe—
All right. Then what about...

219
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:02,835
Garth— Daddy's name?
No, no. Come on.

220
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:05,968
No, not Garth
or ditto Che or any—

221
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:09,537
Che?
I just don't want any of these
mad, eccentric, hippieish—

222
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:12,778
Che?
Alternative—
Yes, your revolutionary half.

223
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:17,948
I think we should call him, in that case,
Che Muffin Quayle.

224
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:20,014
Muffin?
Yes, the Quayle genes.

225
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:23,755
Where do you get Muffin from?
No one's heard of muffins.
High tea by the jolly study fire...

226
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:26,127
While the starving mob
burns London.

227
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:28,689
Is that— Is that how you see me?
No.

228
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:31,201
I see you buying the mob
fish and chips...

229
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,261
While you wait
for law and order to return.

230
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,671
And I love you the way you are.

231
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:45,043
What about Arnold?

232
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:47,176
What about Arnold?
As a name.

233
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,982
Hmm.
Be such a nice gesture.

234
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,618
Well, perhaps it'll be a girl.

235
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:58,492
Mmm. I think it's a boy.

236
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:01,226
I think it's a girl.

237
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,962
You'd better get dressed.

238
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,965
Move that tray.
Dry these glasses.

239
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:15,376
- Can you open your windows, please?
Please get out of the car.

240
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:34,595
Dr. Joshua Ngaba,
Kenya Health Ministry.

241
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:38,194
Sir Bernard Pellegrin,
head of F. C. O. Africa desk.

242
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,500
May I convey Her Majesty's
warmest greetings?

243
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:43,598
I thought that Arnold
was going up-country.

244
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:46,440
He is. Oh, don't worry.

245
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:48,912
He's not gonna take me.
I've already asked him.
Hmm.

246
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,472
Good. And, Tessa—
Yes?

247
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,451
I'd be happier
if you stayed out of Kibera,

248
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,511
At least until
the baby's born anyway.

249
00:22:56,588 --> 00:23:00,581
Um, just you wait until
I'm single again.

250
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:06,328
Hello, Tim. How are you?
Hi.

251
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:09,890
Are you struggling through
without Maude tonight?

252
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:12,630
One of her party headaches.
I take mine standing up.

253
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:14,696
Oh, how manly of you.
Isn't it just?

254
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:16,707
Hello, Arnold.
Tessa.

255
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,903
Hello, Ghita, darling.
Ooh, what a lovely sari.

256
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:24,972
Interesting guests, Mr. Donohue.

257
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,009
This is Kenya, Dr. Bluhm.
Seems only fair to invite the odd native.

258
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:31,750
Mmm. The health minister's turn,
was it?

259
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:33,985
So it seems.

260
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:36,084
Who's that he's talking to?

261
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,994
I have no idea.

262
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:42,397
Thought your spies
knew everything, Tim.
Only God knows everything.

263
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:44,663
He works for Mossad.

264
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,830
You've met Dr. Ngaba, have you?

265
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:50,033
Yes, at the opening
of a new state-of-the-art clinic...

266
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:52,634
Without autoclaves
for sterilizing.
Mmm.

267
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,770
Probably converted them
into a Mercedes.

268
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,781
Hmm.

269
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,783
I've never met an alchemist before.

270
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:01,843
Tessa, darling.

271
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:09,622
Ah, Tessa.
Hello, Porter.

272
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:12,664
May I introduce Tessa Quayle,
Dr. Ngaba,

273
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:15,825
The wife of our representative
for aid effectiveness?

274
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,835
Pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?

275
00:24:17,903 --> 00:24:21,430
And this is Dr. Bluhm
from Médecins dans I'univers.
Good evening.

276
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:23,372
Dr. Bluhm and I have met.

277
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:27,105
Yes, it was at the opening for the clinic
that didn't have the sterilizing equipment.

278
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,808
We never met, Dr. Ngaba,
but I know your work.

279
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,213
Do you know Sir Kenneth Curtiss,
Chief Executive ofThreeBees?

280
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:38,484
- Yes, also by reputation.
Good evening.
- Good evening.

281
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:41,993
Company here in Kenya.
We're very proud ofhim.

282
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,824
And which of the bees are you?

283
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,632
You were going to show us
the garden room, Porter.

284
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,659
There is just one thing
that I'd like to thank Dr. Ngaba for—

285
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:55,229
The free nevirapine.

286
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:59,710
He's, uh, persuaded the manufacturers
to donate it to H. I. V. -positive mothers.

287
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:01,712
It's a wonderful thing.
Shall we?

288
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,510
The problem is,
it isn't actually reaching them.
Some, but not all.

289
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:07,575
So we've been wondering,
is that a standard cock-up, Dr. Ngaba,

290
00:25:07,653 --> 00:25:10,918
Or— or were the pills converted
into the limo that you arrived in?

291
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:13,651
I think that's probably enough.
If you'll come through here, Doctor.

292
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:16,660
Justin.
Excuse me.

293
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:20,562
You've gotta do something about Tessa.
Well, what would you
like me to do, Sandy?

294
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:24,227
Well, she's embarrassing our guests.
Her and that bloody Bluhm.

295
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:26,965
There'll be hell to pay,
I can tell you.

296
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,167
Well, the— the squall
seems to have passed.

297
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:32,836
If you can't control her,
you should keep her locked up.

298
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:35,311
You're wanted on the veranda,
Mr. Woodrow.
Yes.

299
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:50,025
Are so big here, they'll be best
towards the back of the border.

300
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:56,126
Hey, sexy.

301
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:59,034
You look divine.
Sandy, I think you're a pervert.

302
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:01,937
Stop looking at me like that.
We're to have a baby in a week.

303
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,908
Can I come and visit you
in the hospital?

304
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:09,073
You want to visit me in Uhuru?
Uhuru? Tessa, you're not
having it there.

305
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:11,945
Oh, Sandy, come on. Kibera women
have their babies there every day.

306
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:14,781
It's perfectly safe.
No, it's not. It's madness.

307
00:26:14,853 --> 00:26:17,754
Just— Can I just choose—
Wait a minute. That looks a good one.

308
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,950
Shall we run away?

309
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:22,926
Yeah, come on then.
Take me for lunch.

310
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:29,627
- I'm fine. Thank you.

311
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,828
How are you?
I'm fine. Thank you. How are you?

312
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:34,168
How are you?

313
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:37,402
I'm fine. Thank you.
How are you?

314
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:39,808
I'm fine. How are you?

315
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:46,951
- Look, near the car.
- Jomo is getting a test.

316
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:50,580
Of course. You told him to.
It was a suggestion,
not an order.

317
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,251
- What are they carrying
in those littlejars?
- It's probably saliva.

318
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:58,160
But that's not how you test
for H. I. V. Here, is it?

319
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,391
They're also testing for T. B.
Why?

320
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:04,367
When they test for H. I. V.,
they also test for T. B. Free here.

321
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:07,496
- What, just for free?
- A small extra service to humanity.

322
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:10,006
They're a drug company,
Arnold. Come on.

323
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:13,738
No drug company does
something for nothing.

324
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:17,475
Is there... something
you're not telling me—

325
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:19,983
Arnold?

326
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:59,890
Hello, Sandy.

327
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,119
I'm so sorry, Tessa.

328
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:06,153
Gloria sends her sympathies.
What can one say?

329
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:09,257
It was a boy.

330
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:12,201
- Did Justin already tell you that?
- Tessa. Tessa.

331
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,738
This one was born healthy though.

332
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:18,708
Weren't you,
my beautiful, beautiful darling?

333
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:23,544
His name is Baraka.
It means blessing.

334
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:25,947
I... don't quite see.

335
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:30,148
Who the mother is?

336
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:33,282
Her name is Wanza Kilulu.

337
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:36,850
She's 15, and she's dying.

338
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:39,192
Kioko's 12.

339
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:43,291
He walked 40 kilometers
just to keep the flies off
his sister and her baby.

340
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:45,893
Perhaps that's the blessing.

341
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,804
Darling, please don't.

342
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:51,468
Please sit here, Mr. Woodrow.
I'll wait outside.

343
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:54,103
Thank you.

344
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,307
Kioko, here you are.

345
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:01,043
You sweetheart.

346
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,488
- Justin, my darling, could you please
go and get me a fresh bottle of water?
- Hmm? Sure.

347
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:11,988
Now, Sandy?
Yes?

348
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,794
If I tell you something,

349
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:17,699
Will you listen to me?

350
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:19,760
Not here, Tessa.

351
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:22,602
No, Sandy,
if I tell you that that—

352
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:26,667
That that girl over there
was being murdered,
would you believe me?

353
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:30,078
Tessa, you're tired.
You're feverish.
No. No, I'm not.

354
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:33,083
Now we haven't got all of the evidence yet,
but when we get it,

355
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,484
If I bring it to you, will you—will you
actually do something for once?

356
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:41,424
What you need is rest.
Now what I'm— I'm talking about
are coincidences.

357
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:45,156
Tessa, you've got to stop involving yourself
in matters that don't concern you.

358
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,724
You're embarrassing the High Commission,
and you're not doing Justin's career any good.

359
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:53,532
Justin doesn't know what I do.
That doesn't surprise me.

360
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:56,768
Sandy, you've got to promise me...

361
00:29:56,842 --> 00:29:59,743
That you're going to act
on what we tell you.

362
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:02,279
We?
Me and Arnold.

363
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:14,649
Please?
All right. I promise.

364
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:19,622
Within reason.

365
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:23,099
Within reason.

366
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:26,637
Uh, there's a man.

367
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:35,671
She's raving mad.
You've got to get her to a proper clinic.

368
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:38,011
With white doctors,
Mr. Woodrow?

369
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:43,978
For Christ's sake, Justin,
she's your wife.
Yes, she's my wife.

370
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:01,268
You see, she's dead.

371
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,273
What did you give her?
It doesn't matter.

372
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:08,074
Dr. Lorbeer, you have got to stop
testing on patients with H. I. V.

373
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:10,944
- It— Look at me.
- I have to go.

374
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:24,361
Justin, stop the car.
Stop, stop, stop.
Why? What is it?

375
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:36,363
Tessa.

376
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:40,176
It's 40 kilometers to Miluri.

377
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,578
It's gonna take them all night.

378
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:46,242
We can't involve ourselves
in their lives, Tessa.

379
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:48,809
Why?

380
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:56,224
Be reasonable.

381
00:31:56,294 --> 00:31:58,660
There are millions of people.
They all need help.

382
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,994
That's what the agencies
are here for.

383
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:03,557
Yeah, but these are three people
that we can help.

384
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:05,660
Please.

385
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:11,165
Justin.

386
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,437
I'm sorry, Tessa.
I have to put you first.

387
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:21,811
I have to get you home.

388
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:38,700
Probably got enough
there now, Mustafa.

389
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,261
Yeah?
I think.

390
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:44,172
Just the flowers this time, please.

391
00:32:44,242 --> 00:32:46,233
You can spare the weeds.

392
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:49,144
The pest must eat too, bwana.
Yes, I know. If only they would.

393
00:32:49,214 --> 00:32:52,308
They can eat the weeds.
Look, you should be wearing gloves
with that, you know?

394
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,375
And there's a mask
if you want it.
Okay.

395
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:59,116
It's an outrageous thing. It's almost as if
it's a— it's a marriage of convenience—
Shh.

396
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,182
Tessa.
And the only thing it's gonna produce
is dead offspring.

397
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:07,063
I'm sorry to interrupt.

398
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:13,129
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

399
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:16,002
I said, what the fuck is that?
Tessa, it's pesticide.

400
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:18,338
It— It's just unbelievable.

401
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,243
Would you just get that thing
out of this house?

402
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:25,374
Well, if you feel that strongly about it,
yes, Tessa— anything.

403
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:29,717
It would help if you might explain to me
what's upsetting her.

404
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:32,757
I mean, this doesn't kill people, does it?
Unless they swallow it?

405
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:36,089
No.
What? Then can you tell me
why she's so—

406
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,152
You have to trust her, Justin.

407
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:40,720
It's hard, you know,
when she—we don't talk about—

408
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,633
- Does she blame me for losing the baby?
- Of course not. Give her time.

409
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:46,694
Tell her I'll be back later.

410
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:50,033
Wherever there are drug companies...

411
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:52,599
Testing their drugs on people
who they think are expendable,

412
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:55,271
You'll find organizations like ours
trying to fight back.

413
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:58,373
Of course, the problem is that they have
millions to spend on P. R...

414
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,749
While we work with volunteers
and a few donated computers.

415
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,085
If you're gonna dig deeper,
then most of us have Web sites.

416
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:10,093
Check out Oxfam, M. S. F.,
Health Action International—

417
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:12,891
Put it in here.

418
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:17,528
Just mind the roses, please, Mustafa.
Hi, Birgit.

419
00:34:17,602 --> 00:34:21,868
Sorry. More questions.
Tessa never sleeps.
Always time for you, Tessa.

420
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:30,906
Take care of yourself, Tessa, okay?

421
00:34:30,982 --> 00:34:34,782
I'm very tired. I'm sorry.
I can't translate that word to you.

422
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:37,845
So you'd better ask that kind,
nice husband of yours—

423
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:00,300
Okay. See you, Tessa.

424
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:09,619
Hi.
Hi.

425
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:12,554
It's bloody awful weather.

426
00:35:12,624 --> 00:35:15,149
You really shouldn't have waited up.

427
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:18,024
Good. Then I think
you should go to bed.

428
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:24,300
I'm safe home now, sweetheart.
No, you're drenched.
Look, take those wet things off.

429
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:26,894
Tessa, come to bed
with me, please.
Yeah, l—

430
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:30,600
I will, but there's, um, something
I have to do first. It's important.

431
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:33,439
Tessa,

432
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:38,076
Whatever it is
that you and Arnold are doing,

433
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:40,481
I'd like it to stop.

434
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:44,386
Wow.
Who have you been talking to?

435
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:47,914
No one. These are
my concerns, all right?

436
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:51,985
- I'm thinking of your health.
- No. No, you're not.

437
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,554
They've asked you to rein me in,
and you're doing it.

438
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:56,623
It's just unbelievable.

439
00:35:56,701 --> 00:36:00,296
What the hell are you talking about?
I hope you know me better than that.

440
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:03,306
Your life is your own.
That was always our agreement.

441
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:05,865
No. No, no. The agreement was...

442
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:08,003
That my work was gonna be my own.

443
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,070
That's what makes me who I am.

444
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:14,084
I mean, if you stop me from doing my work,
then I am nothing. I'm just nobody. L—

445
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:18,551
I'm not trying to stop you
doing anything.

446
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:21,558
Please.
I'm sorry.

447
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:24,288
I'm just tired. That's all.
Very tired.

448
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:26,353
Then come to bed.

449
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:32,895
Hmm?
Will you get me up for breakfast?

450
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:43,407
I've got to finish my report.

451
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,018
Just smash it like that.
Oh.! Right.

452
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:50,077
Now if you just put those there.

453
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:52,588
You want probably to break them up
into smaller pieces.

454
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:54,648
A bit more vermilion.

455
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:57,695
Oh, you're just very blasé,
aren't you?

456
00:36:57,762 --> 00:37:00,788
You know, just through feel.
No, I wouldn't— No.

457
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:02,924
I wouldn't call it a parasite, no.

458
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:07,765
You're gonna be late for your match.
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

459
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:13,307
Kenny, I can't discuss this on the phone.
wouldn't even give me an appointment.

460
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:17,371
Time was you buggers couldn't get
your tongues far enough up my arse.
What's changed?

461
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:20,440
Hi.
If I find out that this has got
anything to do with that bitch—

462
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:24,181
Come to my office.
L— I've got to go, Kenny. Bye.

463
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,348
Having trouble with ThreeBees, Sandy?

464
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:30,417
Just Kenny being Kenny.
Oh. Nothing to do
with my report then?

465
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:33,623
Oh, he's just ranting.

466
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:36,223
Oh, Sandy, you promised me
you were gonna do something.

467
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,292
I sent your report to London.

468
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:40,599
Really?
Yes.

469
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:42,606
To Pellegrin?
Yes.

470
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:44,767
And?
There was no official response.

471
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:47,572
Well, what was there then?

472
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:50,443
Well, just a personal letter. That's all.

473
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,642
Saying?

474
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:56,118
It's private.
What do you mean,
it's private?

475
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:59,315
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.
I sent him an official document.

476
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,655
I gonna have to call Pellegrin
and ask him.
No, no. Don't do that, Tessa.

477
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:04,854
Why?
It's serious.

478
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:08,763
You know me well enough to know
that I'm not gonna take no
for an answer. Come on.

479
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:12,368
Tessa,

480
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:14,428
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.

481
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:17,497
What?
Report where you are,

482
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:20,940
What you're doing.

483
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:23,173
Trust me, Tessa.

484
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:27,807
This is something
that you should not pursue.

485
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:33,615
I say that as a friend
who cares deeply for you.

486
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:36,956
Sandy?
Oh, Tessa.
Hi, Gloria.

487
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,360
Been wondering
where you'd got to.

488
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,160
Darling, you know,
we really have to leave now.

489
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:44,633
Match starts in half an hour.
Harry's got a cricket match.

490
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:46,693
That is, you're still coming, right?
Yes, of course.

491
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:49,035
You're not too busy, no?
One sec.

492
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:51,098
Right. Okay.

493
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:54,008
Justin's waiting for you in the car.
All right. Tell him
I'll be right down.

494
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:03,382
Sandy, what do you think of me?

495
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:08,383
I think you're beautiful.
Do you?

496
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:10,393
Yes.
Really?

497
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:12,395
Yes.

498
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:15,432
Well, you can have me
if you show me the letter.

499
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,061
Ooh.

500
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:29,344
Are you serious?

501
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:31,405
Yeah.

502
00:39:35,753 --> 00:39:37,914
When?

503
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:41,948
Um, when I get back from Loki.

504
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:46,790
Tessa,

505
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:49,799
If anyone ever found out—

506
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:52,802
I'd shown you the letter,
I'd be ruined.

507
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,134
No one's gonna know, Sandy.

508
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:13,753
Put it back in the drawer.

509
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:16,316
Lock the drawer.
Put the key back.

510
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:20,997
Read it at once.

511
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:23,397
Promise?
Promise.

512
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:39,482
My continent, Africa, is staggering...

513
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,417
Under the weight of not one,
but three plagues.

514
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:45,752
Yet still the governments
of the U. S. A. And Europe,

515
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:49,520
At the behest of the pharmaceutical companies
that seem to control them,

516
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:53,826
Drag their feet and continue
to give us endless reasons...

517
00:40:53,898 --> 00:40:59,803
Why we should buy your branded drugs
at five, 10, 20 times the price.

518
00:40:59,871 --> 00:41:02,203
Sweetheart, don't bother
to see us off. It could be ages.

519
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:04,673
Okay, well, if you're sure.

520
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,542
It's too hot to be
standing around.
Bye, Arnold.

521
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,482
Let me take your bag for you.
Thank you.

522
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:19,546
Bye, sweetheart.

523
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:22,218
See you in, uh— in a couple of days.

524
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:31,027
Tessa.
Tessa?

525
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:34,428
Yeah.

526
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:38,332
Inside a car and had been mutilated.
Turn it off, will you?

527
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:41,132
Certainly. Sorry.

528
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:53,341
Mr. Quayle.!

529
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,320
- Mustafa.

530
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:08,792
Mmm.

531
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:15,130
Tessa's family.
- Yes.

532
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:17,936
Police were here, bwana.
When?

533
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:21,570
This morning. They took away
Mama Tessa's things.

534
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:23,910
Better make a list
of what's missing.

535
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:25,972
Mustafa.

536
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:40,788
See? I told you.

537
00:43:40,865 --> 00:43:44,665
They took away the CD's,
the diskettes, the computer.

538
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:47,465
They came here and took the—
the files, the papers.

539
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:51,599
Just didn't want to touch anything
so that you can come
and see for yourself what they did.

540
00:43:51,676 --> 00:43:53,769
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Mustafa.

541
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:26,333
Dypraxa?

542
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:42,382
Huh.

543
00:44:56,974 --> 00:45:00,705
Darling Tessa, you have hurt me
more than you know.

544
00:45:00,778 --> 00:45:04,236
Trusting you to be honorable,
I afforded you, against all the rules,

545
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:07,375
An opportunity that you have abused
in the worst way.

546
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:12,718
I beg you, for the sake of my career,
to return what you took.

547
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,588
If you will not, then at least save
what is left of me...

548
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:18,958
By chucking in your ridiculous sham
of a marriage, as I will mine,

549
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,726
And bolting with me
to the end of the earth.

550
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:24,791
I love you, I love you...

551
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:26,860
And I love you.

552
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:29,428
Sandy.

553
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:39,611
I'm sorry to have been
so long, Sandy.

554
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:43,448
Seems they've been in here too.

555
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:45,455
Anything missing
in the bedroom?

556
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:48,014
Her laptop's gone
and her disks and all her files.

557
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:51,459
Yes. It's a mess.

558
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:53,554
What's in that?

559
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:56,429
Oh, uh, her will,

560
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,492
Amongst other things.
Oh.

561
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,061
Seems she wanted
to be buried in Africa.

562
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:04,334
Oh.

563
00:46:04,408 --> 00:46:08,071
Darling Tessa. Hmm.

564
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,765
Excuse me.

565
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:35,328
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

566
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:38,739
What are you doing?
Could someone please explain
what they're doing, please?

567
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:42,176
Look, Justin, it— it's just concrete.
It's to keep the grave robbers out.

568
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:47,006
Tessa expressed a wish to lie...

569
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:50,986
In African soil,
not in bloody concrete.

570
00:46:51,055 --> 00:46:53,523
Nothing can grow in concrete.

571
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:55,855
Kindly tell them to leave,
please, Ghita.

572
00:46:57,194 --> 00:47:01,028
And you too, please, gentlemen.
Thank you. It was kind of you to come.

573
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:31,384
Hello.

574
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:34,761
Kioko. It's Kioko?
Yes.

575
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:37,528
You're Wanza's brother.
Justin.
Yes.

576
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:39,535
You brought a card for Tessa?
Yes.

577
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,662
You walked here?
Did you walk?

578
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:43,730
Thank you.

579
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,582
You'll always protect me, won't you?

580
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:37,218
Yeah. Of course.

581
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:40,559
Of course I'll protect you.
And I'm gonna protect you.

582
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:42,963
Justin?

583
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:45,297
Hi. You're a million miles away.

584
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:49,032
Yes, I was. Um, I'm taking refuge
in my nasturtium seeds.

585
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:53,438
Listen, you know—you know
that I'm here for you, don't you?

586
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,776
Yes, I do. Thank you, Ghita.
You're a good friend.

587
00:48:57,848 --> 00:49:00,282
I, uh— I'm afraid I wanted
to ask you a question.

588
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:03,514
Rather a delicate question.
L—Well, maybe it's indelicate.

589
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:07,880
Um—
Anything.

590
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,492
What do you think that Arnold and Tessa
were doing at Lake Turkana?

591
00:49:13,564 --> 00:49:15,862
Oh, I see.

592
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:20,461
You know, they did spend
enough time together to give everyone
the impression that they were—

593
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:22,869
Come on, Justin.
You know what this place is like.

594
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,842
If you can't have sex, you have
other people's sex— real or imagined.

595
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:30,439
Who's this?
It's Claude.

596
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:33,449
Arnold's boyfriend.

597
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:36,384
I'd never have guessed.

598
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:38,853
It's illegal here.
You don't shout about it.

599
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,285
Ah, well.

600
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,350
Wish she could've told me.

601
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,692
Perhaps she didn't think
you needed to know.

602
00:49:58,776 --> 00:50:03,736
Tessa Quayle I have,
but I have no Wanza Kilulu.
Are you sure that is the right name?

603
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:07,648
Uh, yes, Wanza Kilulu, and, uh, there was
a white doctor attending to her,

604
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:09,709
And he was there when she died.

605
00:50:09,787 --> 00:50:13,518
Perhaps he conducted the postmortem.
Maybe you have a record of the postmortem.

606
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:17,253
If I have no patient's record,
how can I have a postmortem record?

607
00:50:17,328 --> 00:50:19,694
And we don't have
European doctors working here.

608
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:22,425
Right, but her name is definitely
Wanza Kilulu,

609
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:25,662
And I remember that she was—
Well, if she does not appear
in my records here—

610
00:50:25,736 --> 00:50:29,001
I'm sorry. She does not—
I don't think she was—
Yes. No, I understand.

611
00:50:29,073 --> 00:50:32,565
I mean, I'm not mad here.
She was in the bed.
Okay, fine, yeah. I'm sorry.

612
00:50:57,468 --> 00:51:00,369
You want money?

613
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:05,308
Fifty.

614
00:51:05,376 --> 00:51:08,209
Fifty. Fifty.

615
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:23,784
Sorry.

616
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,731
He helped my wife,
and I'm trying to find him.

617
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,428
I think he lives here,
but I have no idea where he is.

618
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:42,339
It's a family. You don't know him?

619
00:51:42,413 --> 00:51:45,348
Kioko Kilulu.
Kioko Kilulu?

620
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,407
Yes, a name. Do you know?

621
00:51:47,484 --> 00:51:50,146
Who is it? Who is it?
It's a family, from here.

622
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:55,954
He's a young boy, about 12. No?

623
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:03,322
Kioko?

624
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,334
Kioko, hello.
Hello.

625
00:52:05,402 --> 00:52:07,666
Do— Do you remember me?

626
00:52:07,738 --> 00:52:09,729
I've been looking for you.

627
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:12,605
No trouble.
You're not in trouble.
I just want to talk to you.

628
00:52:12,676 --> 00:52:15,804
Is this the clinic
where Wanza was treated?

629
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:26,648
I cannot help you without—

630
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:33,024
Next.

631
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,662
Can I help you?
Why—Why was that lady
turned away?

632
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:42,000
She refuses treatment.
But she seemed to want
to have treatment.

633
00:52:42,072 --> 00:52:45,906
She's a T. B. Patient
who discontinued her treatment.
Her card was canceled.

634
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:49,503
Isn't that all the more reason
to inoculate her child?

635
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,710
This is diphtheria vaccine.
What is your business here, please?

636
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:56,446
My name is Quayle.
I'm from the British High Commission.

637
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,852
Do you see any of your countrymen
here, Mr. Quayle?

638
00:52:58,922 --> 00:53:02,653
Uh, excuse me one—
May I see your card, Kioko?

639
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:06,419
I see. This is in Wanza's name.

640
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:09,261
That's the family—
It's a family medical card, right?
Yes.

641
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:12,359
And what does "I. C."mean?
It means informed consent.

642
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:16,202
It means they consented to treatment
and have family medical entitlement.

643
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:18,264
And that treatment is Dypraxa?

644
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:23,772
But if they don't give consent,
then they lose the right to medical care?

645
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:28,181
It's not much of a choice, is it?
I suppose they're not even informed
that they're testing a new drug?

646
00:53:28,252 --> 00:53:30,914
- I don't make the rules, Mr. Quayle.
- Mr. Quayle?

647
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:33,650
Yes?
Will you please
come with us?

648
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:39,394
Kioko, there's your card.
Thank you.

649
00:53:53,644 --> 00:53:55,578
Why is the child
being questioned?
It's okay.

650
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:07,052
Why did you come to talk to this boy?

651
00:54:07,124 --> 00:54:10,321
He attended my wife's funeral,
so I came to thank him.

652
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:12,885
For a diplomat,
you're not a very good liar.

653
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:15,056
Well, I haven't risen very high.

654
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:17,123
We know about your wife,
Mr. Quayle.

655
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:22,564
He was her lover— this, uh, Bluhm.

656
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:26,834
So people are pleased to tell me.

657
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:30,106
These men you hired to kill them—

658
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,648
They rape and kill her,
and they let him go.

659
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:35,116
Where did you find them?

660
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:38,450
Well, perhaps I asked a policeman.
Can you tell me what
I'm doing here, please?

661
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:41,184
We've been asked to... keep you here.

662
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:43,818
Right. Help us help you.
I'm sorry. Could you explain?

663
00:54:45,395 --> 00:54:48,262
I have not acquired a taste
for Kenyan tea, I'm afraid.

664
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:51,768
Look, we're trying to help you.
You help us, we help you.

665
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:55,999
If you give us something small,
we can always say we didn't find you.

666
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:58,667
Don't you believe I have the power
to let you go?

667
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,243
Can I help you?
Yes.

668
00:55:02,312 --> 00:55:06,009
My name is Woodrow,
Acting Head of Mission
for Her Majesty's government.

669
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,347
This is Detective Inspector Deasey
of Scotland Yard.

670
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:11,649
Mr. Deasey will be inquiring
into the death of Mr. Quayle's wife.

671
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:14,850
If you have any questions,
ask them of him.

672
00:55:14,925 --> 00:55:17,155
Is that clear?

673
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:19,457
You weren't mistreated?
No.

674
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:23,522
You know whose territory you are in, Mr. —
What did you say your name was?

675
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,296
And your name is?

676
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:28,304
Right.

677
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,704
The, uh—The boy Kioko
who I came to see—

678
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:33,902
What have you done with him?
He ran away.

679
00:55:33,977 --> 00:55:36,207
I hope nothing's happened to him.

680
00:55:39,316 --> 00:55:41,807
Where's your car, Justin?
It's near the market.

681
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:53,523
Is that the official thinking then—
that Arnold killed Tessa?

682
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:55,588
I'm afraid that's looking likely.

683
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:58,396
Do you think
that he was her lover?

684
00:55:58,468 --> 00:56:01,266
I'm afraid that's looking likely too.

685
00:56:01,338 --> 00:56:03,670
What were they doing
up at Lake Turkana?

686
00:56:04,841 --> 00:56:08,800
Romantic setting.
Sorry to have to say it, old chap.

687
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:12,076
But why suspect Bluhm then?
I mean, there may have been others—

688
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,141
Other lovers.

689
00:56:15,218 --> 00:56:18,381
If she was an unfaithful wife,
why stop at Arnold?

690
00:56:18,455 --> 00:56:21,219
I wouldn't listen to rumor,

691
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,282
Unless you've evidence?

692
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,852
Yes, evidence.
That's always the problem.

693
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:29,194
Justin,

694
00:56:29,266 --> 00:56:31,200
Be a good chap
and leave this to us.

695
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:33,634
There are proper channels
for these things.

696
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:58,384
Ghita, hi. Thanks for coming.

697
00:56:58,462 --> 00:57:02,159
So why did you want to meet here?
Something that we shouldn't
be seen talking about?

698
00:57:02,232 --> 00:57:04,894
Dypraxa.

699
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:11,434
I know that Tessa and Arnold
wrote a report
on the ThreeBees trials,

700
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:13,567
And I need to know
what happened to it.

701
00:57:16,313 --> 00:57:18,406
What makes you think I know?

702
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:21,451
Because they trusted you,
and so do I.

703
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,018
Help me, please, Ghita.

704
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,491
All I know is that Tessa
gave Sandy a copy.

705
00:57:33,563 --> 00:57:36,327
Sandy? Why him?

706
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:40,634
Sandy was a compromise—
semiofficial.

707
00:57:41,938 --> 00:57:44,202
Arnold wanted to go public with it.
Tessa wouldn't.

708
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:48,335
Because?
Because she wanted to do it your way,
through channels.

709
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:50,470
But, Justin, I wouldn't bother
looking for it.

710
00:57:50,547 --> 00:57:54,711
If it threatens British commercial interests,
it would've been shredded.
She could've brought it to me.

711
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:57,720
She didn't want
to get you involved.
Why?

712
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:05,350
Ghita, why didn't she
want me involved?
To protect you.

713
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:14,003
Do you know if she showed
the report to anyone else?

714
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,061
Kenny Curtiss.

715
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,378
Time of the month, Kenny?

716
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:24,436
Fuck off.

717
00:58:24,514 --> 00:58:26,505
Might help if you took
the fucking flag out.

718
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,518
Well, get closer to the fucking hole,
and maybe I will.

719
00:58:30,787 --> 00:58:33,620
Interesting man you got there, Crick.

720
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,681
Must be the only white caddy in Africa.

721
00:58:36,827 --> 00:58:41,264
Look, KDH are waiting for me
to default on my Dypraxa commitments,

722
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:43,322
And I have a cash flow problem.

723
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,891
What are you lot going to do about it?

724
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:49,801
We never promised
to protect you commercially.

725
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:53,432
You protect me?
That's fucking rich.

726
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:56,502
A word or two from me
in the right black ear,
a couple of cases of Krug,

727
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,571
And you'd be on the next plane
back home.

728
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:02,379
I mean, I spend more money
on champagne in a year
than your shop's annual fucking budget.

729
00:59:02,452 --> 00:59:06,183
Oh, there you go—
Cause of your cash-flow problem.

730
00:59:06,256 --> 00:59:08,247
You're in my eyeline, old chap.

731
00:59:08,325 --> 00:59:11,488
You're what passes forJames Bond
around here.

732
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:15,053
Get Her Majesty's secret service
to pull a few strings.
It's what you spies do, isn't it?

733
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:18,123
Is it?

734
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:20,601
Never really sure what it is we do.

735
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:26,135
Don't even think about
bullying me, old man.

736
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:29,474
I'm not a member of your gentlemen's club.
I don't have to play by the rules.

737
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:31,912
So it seems.

738
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:33,973
Call that one in, shall we?

739
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:42,022
Mr. Curtiss, I'm sorry
to disturb your game.

740
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:44,754
My name is Justin Quayle
from the High Commission.

741
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:46,989
I believe you knew my wife, Tessa.

742
00:59:47,063 --> 00:59:49,623
Justin. Didn't know
you were a member here.

743
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:51,633
Yes, I met her
at one of your parties.

744
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:53,862
She came to see you, I think.

745
00:59:53,937 --> 00:59:56,997
She gave you a report
that she had written on Dypraxa.

746
00:59:57,073 --> 01:00:00,668
Justin, I really don't think
this is the time or the place—

747
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:04,441
I hope you didn't find her too troublesome,
because she could be a terrier
when she had a scent.

748
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:07,176
Huh, sounds like you're
describing a bitch.

749
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:12,654
I'm sorry about your loss,

750
01:00:12,722 --> 01:00:14,713
But I don't remember
being given any report.

751
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:18,226
Well, that's odd,
because she noted it in her diary.

752
01:00:18,295 --> 01:00:21,196
Then you know more than I do.

753
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:28,168
Didn't know, uh—
Didn't know Tessa kept a diary.

754
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:33,002
Well, I think Tessa was right then, Tim.
You don't know everything.

755
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:37,142
I know where you're going
on Tuesday.

756
01:01:06,142 --> 01:01:09,077
Next, please.

757
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:13,814
Sorry about the weather.

758
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:15,942
It's hardly your fault.

759
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:18,249
Oh, dear. We've had some forgeries
on the diplomatics.

760
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:20,255
I'm gonna have to keep this,
I'm afraid, sir.

761
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:24,316
- What?
- The F. C. O. Will issue you
with a new one in a few days.

762
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:28,853
What if I want to travel with it?
Just two, three days at the most.

763
01:01:28,932 --> 01:01:32,197
Are you saying that's a forgery?
It does happen, sir,
even on diplomatics.

764
01:01:32,268 --> 01:01:36,295
But that was issued to me a year ago
by the diplomatic office—
Sir, the F. C. O. Will take care of that.

765
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:07,133
It's just here on the right.

766
01:02:24,054 --> 01:02:25,988
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.

767
01:02:26,056 --> 01:02:28,456
Let me take that for you.
Oh, I'd rather keep it with me.

768
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:31,255
Uh, club rule, Justin.
I'm sorry.

769
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:33,795
No— No luggage in the, uh—
in the dining room.

770
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:38,027
Could you just tuck it into your cubbyhole,
please, Jimmy? Thank you.
Certainly, sir. Thank you, sir.

771
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:42,003
My dear fellow, what a dreadful time
you've had. Welcome home.
Thank you, Bernard.

772
01:02:42,072 --> 01:02:46,133
Any, uh, plans,
or is it too soon?
Plans?

773
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:48,803
Well, holiday, visiting friends,

774
01:02:48,878 --> 01:02:52,041
The million things you've always wanted
Mmm.

775
01:02:52,115 --> 01:02:55,949
You're on indefinite sick leave.
Enjoy it.

776
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:59,182
I hear the, uh— the snow's
very good at Chamonix.

777
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:02,588
I don't have a passport, Bernard.
They took mine at the airport.

778
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:06,322
Oh, of course, yes.
You missed the, um—
You missed the recall.

779
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:11,560
Mmm. The sole meunière's
not bad here,

780
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:14,034
If— if you like sole.

781
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:16,937
Otherwise have it grilled.
Grilled'll be fine.

782
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:21,166
Um, no starters, I think.

783
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:28,273
You've been cleared, by the way.

784
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:31,320
Thought we'd get that bit
of unpleasantness dealt with first.

785
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:34,117
Cleared for what?
Um, of what.

786
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,658
Uh, murder most foul.

787
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:40,457
Seems you didn't hire
contract killers
in a den of vice after all.

788
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:44,193
Deasey is satisfied
it was a crime of passion
by our dark medical horse.

789
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:46,258
It's just a question now
of finding Bluhm.

790
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:48,361
Arnold Bluhm is gay,
Bernard.

791
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:51,100
Gay men don't rape
their women friends.

792
01:03:51,174 --> 01:03:55,270
Well, I've known one or two
very savage queens in my time.

793
01:03:55,345 --> 01:04:00,510
Do you no good to go poking around
under rocks, Justin.

794
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,552
Some very nasty things
live under rocks,

795
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,611
Especially in foreign gardens.

796
01:04:05,688 --> 01:04:09,852
Advice of a friend.
What is it that I'm not
to look into, Bernard?

797
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:12,724
Quayles have always made
reliable foreign service men.

798
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:16,925
Shouldn't be surprised
if you've still got a small
Head of Mission in your knapsack.

799
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,231
Challenging post.
More challenging than
dealing with Kenny Curtiss?

800
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:25,701
He's a crude sort of chap, our Kenny,
but he flies the flag for us.

801
01:04:25,775 --> 01:04:28,471
He got up dear Tessa's nose, I fear.

802
01:04:28,545 --> 01:04:30,809
- Yes, she wrote a report about it.
- About Kenny?

803
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,871
No, about Dypraxa.
Ah, that.

804
01:04:32,949 --> 01:04:36,908
She expected some action to be taken,
but none was, was it?

805
01:04:36,986 --> 01:04:39,716
She tell you about the letter,
or did you find it among her things?

806
01:04:39,789 --> 01:04:43,725
Tucked into her diary,
perhaps?
What letter is that, Bernard?

807
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:48,730
Ramblings of an aging fart.
Senility setting in early, alas.

808
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:52,131
Naughty of her to take it though.
Very naughty indeed.

809
01:04:52,202 --> 01:04:54,102
Yes, I found that.

810
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,832
Be grateful to have it back.
Written under stress, you understand.

811
01:04:56,906 --> 01:04:59,898
Regrettable things said. Wouldn't
want it falling into the wrong hands.

812
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:02,638
Sorry, Bernard.
Are we talking about the same letter?

813
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:04,646
What's yours about?

814
01:05:07,116 --> 01:05:09,243
Undying love.

815
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:11,253
Ah.

816
01:05:15,325 --> 01:05:17,623
What's yours?

817
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:21,755
They're not so good grilled.
You should've had the meunière.

818
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:24,861
Ladies and gentlemen—

819
01:05:40,016 --> 01:05:45,181
Ladies and gentlemen,
please keep all your belongings
with you at all times.

820
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,835
It's good to see you, Ham.

821
01:06:02,905 --> 01:06:05,999
Sorry about the blubbing.
It's those bloody Latin genes,
you know.

822
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:08,009
It's the same old Ham.

823
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:10,568
Oh, no. No, not anymore.

824
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:13,343
God, I loved her rotten.

825
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:15,350
And she loved you rotten.

826
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:19,320
First cousins can be closer
than siblings.

827
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:23,018
I still don't understand why I let you
talk me out of going to the funeral.

828
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:26,118
It was the wrong crowd for you, Ham.
We'll have a private memorial service here.

829
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:29,392
You can blub
all your way through it.
Don't think I won't.

830
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:32,434
Hire the Abbey.
You can afford it now.
Can I?

831
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:37,166
Tess left you bloody well off.
Want to know what you're worth?
Not particularly.

832
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,438
Oh, I've got the keys to the Chelsea house.
Thought you might want to stay there
while you're in London.

833
01:06:41,511 --> 01:06:43,502
No, I'd rather not.
Well, it's all yours.

834
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:45,945
That and her African women's charity.

835
01:06:46,015 --> 01:06:48,575
Said it would get you
out of the garden.
When did she say that?

836
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:51,176
Two weeks before she died.

837
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:55,614
Look, I am ravenous.
Have you had lunch?

838
01:06:55,692 --> 01:06:58,627
Yes, I have. A very civilized lunch
with Bernard Pellegrin...

839
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:02,688
Who expressed an interest
in Tessa's diary.

840
01:07:02,765 --> 01:07:05,029
But Tess never kept a diary.
She hated the things.

841
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:09,231
You and I know that.
Pellegrin must have been disinformed.

842
01:07:09,305 --> 01:07:14,106
Tess thought she was being watched.
Didn't stop her e-mailing twice a day.

843
01:07:14,177 --> 01:07:17,203
More inquiries than Google.

844
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,078
Look at him.
The boy is two-thirds machine.

845
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:23,482
I'm telling you, it's scary.
Mind of a computer.

846
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:26,989
Appetite of a waste disposal.
And what's the other third?

847
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:30,116
Oh, Manzini, unquestionably.

848
01:07:30,193 --> 01:07:32,991
Those e-mails from Tess—
Guido helped me with them.

849
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:34,996
Company stuff. Boring.

850
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:38,727
Mm. Ownership, franchises,
that sort of thing.

851
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:41,326
I'm trying to find out
who brokered the marriage.

852
01:07:41,404 --> 01:07:45,306
What marriage?
KDH and ThreeBees.

853
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:49,402
KDH make Dypraxa.
ThreeBees test it.

854
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:53,643
It's a marriage of convenience, of course.
Both in it for what they can get out of it.

855
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:56,480
That phrase about the marriage—
Is that Tess's phrase or yours?

856
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:58,850
Oh, hers. Hers.

857
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:02,955
Producing dead offspring.

858
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:05,926
Oh, this is so good!
Why don't you try some.

859
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:08,828
It looks disgusting.

860
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:11,731
I can get that stuff
through her mirror server.

861
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:15,100
Well, how do you do that?
All you need is the password. Duh.

862
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:17,503
Yeah, but I don't have her password.

863
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:20,133
Come on, Jus.
Five letters. Three guesses.

864
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:22,677
- I have no idea.
- My name— Guido.

865
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:26,306
She used the one for the "l"
and the zero for the "O."

866
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:30,149
- I set it up for her.
- Wait, wait.

867
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:34,212
- Give him a chance to read it.
- Lightning tour. I'm printing as I go.

868
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:38,458
What's Hippo?

869
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:41,156
German— German Pharma Watch.

870
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:43,164
Keep an eye on what
the drug companies are up to.

871
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:48,831
Copy that.

872
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:54,974
KDH. Can we open that?

873
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:57,512
Sure. No problem.

874
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,481
A new plague is sweeping the world.

875
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:05,988
In the 21 st century, multi-resistant
T. B. Will kill one in three.

876
01:09:06,055 --> 01:09:09,081
- But now there is hope.
- It's huge, isn't it?

877
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:13,822
KDH is developing a revolutionary
treatment for T. B. Sufferers.
It's global.

878
01:09:13,896 --> 01:09:18,230
We call it Dypraxa.
You will call it life.

879
01:09:18,301 --> 01:09:20,326
And I call it a blockbuster.

880
01:09:20,403 --> 01:09:24,863
Karel Delacourt Hudson.
The world is our clinic.

881
01:09:24,941 --> 01:09:27,876
It's gonna sell like hotcakes.

882
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:32,210
- Can you magnify that photograph?
- Magnify it? He can send it out
for doughnuts.

883
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:41,319
Is it possible to zoom in on it?
Yeah, sure.

884
01:09:43,993 --> 01:09:47,554
It's Pellegrin.
Why is he there?

885
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,894
There's a personal file.
Do you mind if I open it?

886
01:09:49,966 --> 01:09:52,196
No, sure. Go ahead.

887
01:10:00,276 --> 01:10:02,767
Ti amo.

888
01:10:02,845 --> 01:10:06,246
So you'd better ask that kind,
nice husband of yours to translate.

889
01:10:06,315 --> 01:10:09,375
He's got very delicate little ears.

890
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:12,819
He's dreaming
about his favorite things.

891
01:10:12,889 --> 01:10:15,949
He's dreaming about...

892
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:19,426
A world without any weeds.

893
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:25,592
Justin Quayle,
it's time to get up.

894
01:10:25,668 --> 01:10:29,934
Go away.
You're very annoying.
Time to get up, Justin.

895
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:34,773
Get up.

896
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:44,043
This is really just not fair.

897
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,645
It's time to get up.

898
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:50,021
Tessa, just let me sleep.

899
01:10:50,092 --> 01:10:52,458
There's gardening to be done.

900
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:55,827
Weeds to be pulled out.

901
01:10:57,667 --> 01:11:00,261
Good morning.
Come back to bed.

902
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:04,405
Good morning.

903
01:11:04,473 --> 01:11:06,498
Oh, sweetheart.

904
01:11:20,056 --> 01:11:22,854
Moral dilemma, Ham.

905
01:11:22,925 --> 01:11:26,725
And the person that I most
want to tell can't be told.

906
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:32,628
I had a creepy love letter today.

907
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:34,795
It's not your fault.

908
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,168
From a five-star creep.

909
01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:39,730
You've got to move on, huh?

910
01:11:39,809 --> 01:11:43,370
I've cold-bloodedly led on.

911
01:11:43,446 --> 01:11:46,882
I stole something from him.

912
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:51,010
And worse,
I made him a vile promise...

913
01:11:51,087 --> 01:11:56,320
That I have absolutely
no intention ofkeeping.

914
01:11:56,392 --> 01:12:00,852
Oh, do come in.
Yeah, please. Of course.

915
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,125
Thank you.

916
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,861
You lead the way.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take a left.

917
01:12:05,935 --> 01:12:11,498
I really hate to think how
it would hurtJustin ifhe knew.

918
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:14,441
I've violated his code, Ham,

919
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:18,139
In the most cynical way.

920
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:21,547
And the end
thatjustifies my means?

921
01:12:21,617 --> 01:12:26,714
I need this creep to help me
blackmail Her Majesty's government.

922
01:12:26,789 --> 01:12:30,850
Please tell me I'm not a ruthless bitch.

923
01:12:30,926 --> 01:12:35,590
Please tell me thatJustin
would understand ifhe knew.

924
01:12:35,665 --> 01:12:39,032
If you give me the wrong answer,
then I will push you into the Tiber...

925
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:41,729
Like I did when we were 16.

926
01:12:42,872 --> 01:12:44,897
Ciao, my darling.

927
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:49,135
Thank you.

928
01:12:49,211 --> 01:12:53,807
For this wonderful gift.

929
01:12:53,883 --> 01:12:56,977
How very generous of me.

930
01:12:57,053 --> 01:12:59,954
No, l—

931
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:16,664
Here, Justin, put this on.

932
01:13:32,488 --> 01:13:35,480
I like it here.
This is where you work from?
Mm.

933
01:13:35,558 --> 01:13:38,152
Amnesty.

934
01:13:38,227 --> 01:13:40,161
Won't make any difference.

935
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:42,390
That's the official line
of the Foreign Office.

936
01:13:42,465 --> 01:13:46,629
I thought you were like that.
I thought you were one of those
privileged revolutionaries.

937
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,943
- My lady.
- Am I?

938
01:14:02,017 --> 01:14:06,511
These plants— If they were children,
you'd be prosecuted.

939
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:10,685
I do water them.
When I remember.

940
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,966
You say you're all into saving lives
around the world,

941
01:14:20,035 --> 01:14:22,663
But you let your poor plants die.

942
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:25,571
I say put people first.

943
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:32,012
Why don't you water them?
You're being cruel.

944
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:35,581
I feel safe with you.

945
01:14:37,453 --> 01:14:39,512
I can imagine when you were six.

946
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:41,556
You leading the revolution.

947
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:57,805
Ham? Hi. It's Justin.
Listen.

948
01:14:57,873 --> 01:15:02,003
Do you still represent that
dodgy client in Amsterdam?

949
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:07,506
Sorry.

950
01:15:09,485 --> 01:15:13,353
Sorry. Sorry. I only just got it.
Directions for use.

951
01:15:13,422 --> 01:15:16,323
No air travel, no credit cards.

952
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:19,486
Never say your name on the phone,
or the computers will kick in.

953
01:15:19,562 --> 01:15:21,928
Dodgy client adds,
"Welcome to my world."

954
01:15:21,997 --> 01:15:24,761
Well, I don't want his world.
No choice, old chum.

955
01:15:24,834 --> 01:15:26,995
Actually, I'm getting
a bit paranoid myself.

956
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:30,061
Look, suppose I posited
that all this was just coincidence—

957
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:32,107
Tess killed by bandits,
pure and simple...

958
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:34,335
And that you're being
as paranoid as she was.

959
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:36,605
Ham.

960
01:15:39,615 --> 01:15:41,708
Thanks for trying, Ham.

961
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:44,582
I have to finish what she started.

962
01:15:44,653 --> 01:15:47,588
Well, look, look. I've got the address
of Aunt Claudia, the old bat in Rome.

963
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:50,454
If you need to contact me,
you'd better do it through her.

964
01:15:50,526 --> 01:15:52,756
She adored Tess.

965
01:15:54,663 --> 01:15:57,564
I failed her, Ham.

966
01:15:57,633 --> 01:15:59,692
I lost my faith in her.

967
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:01,633
No, she forgives you.

968
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:05,600
She loved you rotten too,
you know.

969
01:16:05,674 --> 01:16:08,404
You think?
Oh, yeah.

970
01:16:12,014 --> 01:16:13,948
Thank you.

971
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:11,567
It seems our erstwhile colleague
has disappeared.

972
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,474
Four days ago he lunched
in London with Pellegrin,

973
01:17:15,544 --> 01:17:20,982
Who describes him as overwrought,
after which he visited his wife's lawyer...

974
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,575
Before going off our radar.

975
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:26,951
The poor man seems
to have convinced himself...

976
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:31,755
There was a conspiracy against Tessa
in which we are all complicit.

977
01:17:33,162 --> 01:17:37,121
Lfhe has left the U. K.,
he did so without a passport.

978
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:42,034
Therefore, any contact from Justin
must be reported to me immediately.

979
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:44,436
In his own best interest.

980
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:49,674
No point asking if you've
heard from him, I suppose?

981
01:17:49,745 --> 01:17:52,509
No, no, Tim, none at all.

982
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:57,575
Birgit, why are ThreeBees spending
$70 million testing Dypraxa for KDH?

983
01:17:57,653 --> 01:17:59,951
I mean, is the African market
worth that much?

984
01:18:00,022 --> 01:18:02,354
Tessa, you have to understand
the scale of this.

985
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:06,121
There is a T. B. Epidemic coming.
It will affect the entire world.

986
01:18:06,195 --> 01:18:10,359
Or, put into the language that stock
exchanges all over the world understand,

987
01:18:10,432 --> 01:18:13,094
If the T. B. Market performs as forecast,

988
01:18:13,168 --> 01:18:16,137
Billions and billions of dollars
are waiting to be earned.

989
01:18:16,205 --> 01:18:18,605
And the boy to earn them is Dypraxa.

990
01:18:18,674 --> 01:18:21,905
Lf, of course,
the preliminary trials in Africa...

991
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:25,105
Have not thrown up
any disturbing side effects.

992
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,736
Ich suche Birgit.

993
01:18:54,076 --> 01:18:57,011
Ich bin Justin Quayle,

994
01:18:57,079 --> 01:18:59,309
Tessa Quayle's Ehemann.

995
01:19:06,355 --> 01:19:10,348
- Michael Adams.

996
01:19:19,201 --> 01:19:21,135
Okay, Herr Adams.

997
01:19:22,438 --> 01:19:26,841
She collects Karl at 3:00
from the kindergarten at Bahnhofstrasse.

998
01:19:50,132 --> 01:19:53,192
Karl, here.

999
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:01,071
Birgit.

1000
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:04,078
You sent this to my wife.

1001
01:20:04,146 --> 01:20:06,080
Justin.

1002
01:20:06,148 --> 01:20:09,549
I need to talk to you.
Our computers
were stolen last night.

1003
01:20:09,618 --> 01:20:11,609
Yes, I know.
They have never gone
this far before.

1004
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:14,053
I can't be seen with you.
Sorry. I've Karl to think of.

1005
01:20:14,123 --> 01:20:16,182
Is there some safe place
we could talk?

1006
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:18,522
Nowhere. Nowhere safe.
Nowhere?

1007
01:20:18,594 --> 01:20:21,586
Please. Just... a few questions.

1008
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:24,393
Okay, let's talk here.
With these people.
All right.

1009
01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:28,402
Okay. My bike's across the street.
Ask your questions before we get to it.

1010
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:29,903
Is it a scam?
Scam?

1011
01:20:29,972 --> 01:20:33,408
Dypraxa.
Does it cure T. B.?
Yes, it cures.

1012
01:20:33,475 --> 01:20:36,706
But it can also kill, you know,
because they haven't got
the formula right.

1013
01:20:36,778 --> 01:20:39,508
Right. So why don't they work on that?

1014
01:20:43,585 --> 01:20:46,918
It's cheaper to fix the trials.

1015
01:20:46,989 --> 01:20:49,355
Exclude the patients that
have side effects, you know.

1016
01:20:49,424 --> 01:20:52,359
To go back to the lab would
cost them time— two years—

1017
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:56,693
Millions of dollars, and other companies
would have time to produce their own cures.

1018
01:20:56,765 --> 01:20:58,756
Okay, next question.

1019
01:20:58,834 --> 01:21:01,359
You said to Tessa in your e-mails
that the Kenyan government
had approved the trials.

1020
01:21:01,436 --> 01:21:03,961
Somebody bribed them.
Who?

1021
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:06,439
ThreeBees, Lorbeer.
We don't know.

1022
01:21:06,508 --> 01:21:10,808
But $50,000 in the right hands,
and you can test battery acid
as skin lotion.

1023
01:21:10,879 --> 01:21:12,938
My bike's there.

1024
01:21:13,015 --> 01:21:15,984
Stop! Stop!

1025
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:18,884
- Stop!

1026
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:46,004
Who is Lorbeer?

1027
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:48,481
Birgit, is it a company?

1028
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:51,417
A white coat.
He invented Dypraxa.

1029
01:21:51,486 --> 01:21:53,579
When patients started to die,
Lorbeerjumped clear.

1030
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:57,284
Is that why Tessa went to Lokichogio?
Is that where Lorbeer is?

1031
01:21:57,359 --> 01:21:59,418
Disappeared.
Murdered?

1032
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:02,361
Disappeared.
We've gotta go. I'm sorry.

1033
01:22:02,431 --> 01:22:04,365
Where can I find him?

1034
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,281
Birgit? Where?

1035
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:25,286
Go back to Africa.
Lorbeer's still there.

1036
01:24:32,514 --> 01:24:36,006
Tessa, why didn't you tell me?

1037
01:24:37,819 --> 01:24:39,912
I could have helped you.

1038
01:24:45,026 --> 01:24:48,757
It is my sad duty to inform you
that Dr. Bluhm has been found.

1039
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:50,855
I'll spare you the details.

1040
01:24:50,932 --> 01:24:53,799
Suffice to say, the poor fellow...

1041
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:57,600
Seems to have been tortured to death
on the same day Tessa was killed.

1042
01:24:57,672 --> 01:25:00,106
Which would seem to exonerate him.

1043
01:25:00,175 --> 01:25:02,643
Seem? So what's the new theory?

1044
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:04,975
That he tortured himself to death?

1045
01:25:05,046 --> 01:25:07,139
That'd save you looking
for anyone else, wouldn't it?

1046
01:25:07,215 --> 01:25:08,944
Moving on.

1047
01:25:17,192 --> 01:25:19,717
What is the purpose of your visit?

1048
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:21,729
I'm seeing a friend.

1049
01:25:23,799 --> 01:25:27,326
Welcome to Kenya, Mr. Black.
Thank you.

1050
01:25:27,536 --> 01:25:30,562
Has anyone seen
ThreeBees' share price lately?

1051
01:25:32,307 --> 01:25:36,004
Does that mean he won't be able
to contribute to tombola?

1052
01:25:36,077 --> 01:25:40,013
Hardly Kenny's fault if someone
put the word out on him.

1053
01:25:40,081 --> 01:25:43,209
Wish I'd know that's all it took.
I'd have done it sooner.

1054
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:47,654
I expect he'll land on his feet.
Give him a life peerage.

1055
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:52,819
Henceforth you shall be known as
Lord fucking Curtiss of fucking Kenya.

1056
01:26:09,744 --> 01:26:14,374
Whoever you are, I don't
take kindly to being blackmailed.

1057
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:23,115
Christ. How did you get here?

1058
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:26,456
Safari tour. Via Paris.

1059
01:26:26,528 --> 01:26:28,792
Hunting me now, Justin?

1060
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:32,197
You're the one on the run.

1061
01:26:34,135 --> 01:26:38,094
I loved her.
I'm not ashamed of it.

1062
01:26:38,173 --> 01:26:41,370
Nor should you be...
if it were true.

1063
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:44,677
It's not for you to tell me
how I felt.

1064
01:26:46,948 --> 01:26:50,145
If you've read that, you'll see
that I let her read something
she shouldn't.

1065
01:26:50,218 --> 01:26:52,152
Yeah. A letter from Pellegrin.

1066
01:26:53,889 --> 01:26:55,982
She trusted you.

1067
01:26:56,057 --> 01:26:58,048
What do you want for that?

1068
01:26:58,126 --> 01:27:03,462
I want to know why Pellegrin
suppressed Tessa's report.

1069
01:27:03,532 --> 01:27:07,127
It was him, wasn't it?
Don't try and play detective.

1070
01:27:07,202 --> 01:27:11,002
ThreeBees, KDH, Dypraxa.
What's the story on that axis of evil?

1071
01:27:11,072 --> 01:27:15,406
KDH is Swiss-Canadian.
So why are we involved?

1072
01:27:15,477 --> 01:27:18,241
Curtiss is one of us.
He's British.

1073
01:27:18,313 --> 01:27:21,680
Christ, Justin, stop bleeding
for bloody Africa
and show some loyalty.

1074
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:25,151
That plant KDH built in Wales
could have gone to France.

1075
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:27,620
Fifteen hundred jobs
in a depressed region.

1076
01:27:27,689 --> 01:27:29,987
We owed them.

1077
01:27:32,427 --> 01:27:35,521
They needed help
with the Dypraxa trials.

1078
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:38,794
KDH needed
an investment partner here.

1079
01:27:38,867 --> 01:27:42,428
Curtiss and ThreeBees
served us both.

1080
01:27:42,504 --> 01:27:45,098
And Tessa wanted what?

1081
01:27:48,677 --> 01:27:51,976
Pressure on Kenny...

1082
01:27:53,214 --> 01:27:56,149
To stop the tests,
redesign the bloody drug.

1083
01:27:59,254 --> 01:28:01,814
Three years' delay,
millions of dollars.

1084
01:28:03,592 --> 01:28:05,753
Or?

1085
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:09,524
We're not paid
to be bleeding hearts.

1086
01:28:09,598 --> 01:28:11,532
You know that, Justin.

1087
01:28:13,201 --> 01:28:16,170
We're not killing people
who wouldn't be dead otherwise.

1088
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:21,239
Look at the death rate.
Not that anybody's counting.

1089
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:25,177
But you were
a bleeding heart, Sandy.

1090
01:28:25,246 --> 01:28:29,876
Tessa was your salvation,
wasn't she, from all this?

1091
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:33,685
You loved her. Remember?

1092
01:28:35,323 --> 01:28:38,759
Pellegrin said the report
was too damaging...

1093
01:28:38,827 --> 01:28:40,920
And she had to be stopped.

1094
01:28:40,996 --> 01:28:45,490
Oh, yes. She was stopped.

1095
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:50,404
I betrayed her.

1096
01:28:52,007 --> 01:28:53,941
We all did.

1097
01:28:55,577 --> 01:28:59,206
You did it by... growing flowers.

1098
01:29:05,186 --> 01:29:07,950
How did you betray her, Sandy?

1099
01:29:12,027 --> 01:29:14,689
They wanted to know
what she was up to.

1100
01:29:14,763 --> 01:29:18,392
I'm the one who told them
she was going to Loki.

1101
01:29:18,466 --> 01:29:24,302
- Who did you tell?
- Pellegrin.

1102
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:29,404
But God knows who he told.

1103
01:30:03,378 --> 01:30:06,575
Ghita, get in the car.
Get in the car!

1104
01:30:06,648 --> 01:30:11,415
- Go!

1105
01:30:23,064 --> 01:30:24,998
Get in.

1106
01:30:27,035 --> 01:30:28,969
Listen, fuckhead,
if I wanted you dead,

1107
01:30:29,037 --> 01:30:30,971
I would've brought Crick with me.

1108
01:30:32,474 --> 01:30:34,942
I wanna show you something.

1109
01:30:35,009 --> 01:30:37,944
Show me from there.

1110
01:30:38,012 --> 01:30:41,641
Don't mess me about.
I'm doing you a favor.

1111
01:30:56,965 --> 01:30:59,525
How did you know where I'd be?

1112
01:30:59,601 --> 01:31:01,762
I've still got a friend or two, you know?

1113
01:31:03,505 --> 01:31:08,101
We're marked men, Quayle.
They've called in my fucking bank loans.

1114
01:31:08,176 --> 01:31:11,873
I'm finished.
They want you silenced.

1115
01:31:11,946 --> 01:31:16,349
And they want another country's flag
flying over my pharma division.

1116
01:31:18,419 --> 01:31:23,083
So, you've been asking
about Wanza Kilulu.

1117
01:31:25,393 --> 01:31:30,387
She's under there,
covered in quicklime.

1118
01:31:30,465 --> 01:31:33,434
Her and 62 others
who never officially existed.

1119
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:35,435
Dypraxa?

1120
01:31:38,373 --> 01:31:40,307
Yeah.

1121
01:31:41,976 --> 01:31:45,434
Is that where I'm going?
Not on my agenda.

1122
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:51,482
Then why are you
showing me this?

1123
01:31:52,821 --> 01:31:57,190
Let's just say
if I'm going to the wall,
I want a trophy.

1124
01:31:57,258 --> 01:32:01,354
That's what you lot do,
isn't it? Heads on walls.

1125
01:32:02,764 --> 01:32:05,392
I think I'll have Pellegrin's
fucking head on mine.

1126
01:32:08,036 --> 01:32:12,632
So, now you know where it is.
I'm not taking any fucking questions.

1127
01:32:12,707 --> 01:32:15,904
What about Lorbeer?

1128
01:32:15,977 --> 01:32:20,277
That Bible-thumping bullshitter,
he's doing his penance in the Sudan.

1129
01:32:20,348 --> 01:32:22,714
Jesus the healer.

1130
01:32:35,597 --> 01:32:39,055
You don't know where I'm going?
You get one guess.

1131
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:44,802
I'm gonna surprise you, Tess.

1132
01:32:44,873 --> 01:32:47,467
- I love this man.
- Hello.

1133
01:32:56,584 --> 01:33:01,954
I wish you had shared
just a few things.

1134
01:33:07,896 --> 01:33:10,763
I love you.
I love you too.

1135
01:34:28,843 --> 01:34:32,472
Who did you think it was?

1136
01:34:32,547 --> 01:34:36,108
Fuck you, Donohue.
This is bandit country.

1137
01:34:40,221 --> 01:34:42,883
Did you tell Curtiss where I'd be?

1138
01:34:42,957 --> 01:34:44,891
Ghita's car?

1139
01:34:44,959 --> 01:34:48,224
Well, Ghita's
my only friend here, Tim.

1140
01:34:48,296 --> 01:34:50,764
I wouldn't want her
to get into trouble.
She won't.

1141
01:34:53,034 --> 01:34:56,526
You do have another friend,
believe it or not.

1142
01:34:56,604 --> 01:34:59,539
You won't find what
you're looking for in Loki.

1143
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:03,067
Let's be honest
with each other, shall we?

1144
01:35:03,144 --> 01:35:06,079
That's a— a late career change
for you, Tim.

1145
01:35:07,348 --> 01:35:10,977
There's something else
we have in common, you and I.

1146
01:35:11,052 --> 01:35:14,180
We'll both be dead by Christmas.

1147
01:35:14,255 --> 01:35:16,985
There's a contract out on you.

1148
01:35:17,058 --> 01:35:19,618
Same people who did for Tessa,
I shouldn't wonder.

1149
01:35:19,694 --> 01:35:21,628
Mine's cancer.

1150
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:26,131
My pain is controllable.

1151
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:30,398
I knew that you were ill.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

1152
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:33,998
Yeah. Sandy tell you?

1153
01:35:34,075 --> 01:35:36,009
He fingered Tessa.

1154
01:35:36,077 --> 01:35:38,238
He said he'd made a phone call.

1155
01:35:38,312 --> 01:35:42,646
He didn't know they'd kill her.
Silly sod was besotted with her.

1156
01:35:42,717 --> 01:35:45,811
But that's the way it works
with corporate murder.

1157
01:35:45,887 --> 01:35:48,822
Boss gets wind of something,
calls in his head of security,

1158
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:53,259
Who talks to someone,
who talks to a friend of someone.

1159
01:35:53,327 --> 01:35:56,228
Finishes up with an answering machine
in a rented office,

1160
01:35:56,297 --> 01:35:59,061
A couple of sensitive gentlemen
in a blue pickup truck.

1161
01:35:59,133 --> 01:36:01,533
They will never know
who ordered the hit.

1162
01:36:04,505 --> 01:36:06,439
I can get you out of Kenya.

1163
01:36:06,507 --> 01:36:09,476
It's one of the few things
we still do well.

1164
01:36:09,544 --> 01:36:11,705
Drop it now, and it's over.

1165
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:14,145
I'll make sure word
gets to the right people.

1166
01:36:14,215 --> 01:36:18,345
Go home... and live.

1167
01:36:18,419 --> 01:36:20,979
But I don't have a home, Tim.

1168
01:36:21,055 --> 01:36:23,023
Tessa was my home.

1169
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:28,785
Know about Bluhm?

1170
01:36:28,863 --> 01:36:30,797
What about Bluhm?

1171
01:36:30,865 --> 01:36:33,333
Let me tell you
what you're facing.

1172
01:36:35,169 --> 01:36:38,764
They dragged him into the desert,
cut out his tongue,

1173
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,537
Chopped offhis manly apparatus
and stuffed them where his tongue had been.

1174
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:44,703
Then they crucified the poor bugger.

1175
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:48,977
Pathologist's opinion is
he was still alive when they nailed him up.

1176
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:51,075
Of course, you might be lucky.

1177
01:36:51,152 --> 01:36:54,178
It might be in their interest
to make yours look like suicide.

1178
01:36:54,255 --> 01:36:56,189
Which it is.

1179
01:36:56,257 --> 01:37:00,694
Balance of mind disturbed.
No fuss, no inquiry.

1180
01:37:00,761 --> 01:37:03,127
Nothing.
Right.

1181
01:37:03,197 --> 01:37:05,961
Well, thank you for the warning.

1182
01:37:06,033 --> 01:37:08,228
You've been very kind.

1183
01:37:11,038 --> 01:37:13,336
I was afraid you'd say that.

1184
01:37:17,044 --> 01:37:19,171
In case you meet any bandits.

1185
01:38:23,544 --> 01:38:26,104
I, uh— I wondered
if you could help me.
Yes, sir?

1186
01:38:37,892 --> 01:38:40,087
Thank you for agreeing
to take me, Mr. —

1187
01:38:40,161 --> 01:38:43,130
Please. I can't hear you.
Please put these on.

1188
01:38:43,197 --> 01:38:46,997
I said thank you
for taking me, Mr. Andika.

1189
01:38:47,068 --> 01:38:50,333
Jonah. No formalities up here.

1190
01:38:50,404 --> 01:38:53,805
Do you know about
Southern Sudan, Mr. Black?

1191
01:38:53,874 --> 01:38:56,399
The place we're going to
is a food camp,

1192
01:38:56,477 --> 01:38:59,173
But on the way we must drop
to some villages.

1193
01:38:59,247 --> 01:39:02,683
We'rejust about to do a live run.
Take a look.

1194
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:15,520
His name is Brandt,
this man you want to see.

1195
01:39:15,596 --> 01:39:17,962
He works at the clinic up there.

1196
01:39:18,032 --> 01:39:20,967
He's a good man,
but he pushes God with the pills.

1197
01:39:21,035 --> 01:39:23,003
Don't get him started.

1198
01:39:30,244 --> 01:39:35,238
Better strap yourself in.
We're landing on the surface of the moon.

1199
01:40:18,592 --> 01:40:22,028
Hi. Uh, Robert Black,
freelance journalist.

1200
01:40:22,096 --> 01:40:24,030
I'm looking for Dr. Brandt.

1201
01:40:24,098 --> 01:40:26,760
Dr. Brandt? Yeah, he's just here.
He's traveling over from the village.
Thank you.

1202
01:40:35,343 --> 01:40:38,369
- Dr. Brandt?
- I'll see you over by the tent.

1203
01:41:01,802 --> 01:41:04,600
My name is Robert Black.
I'm a freelancejournalist.
Uh-huh.

1204
01:41:04,672 --> 01:41:07,869
I'm told that you're the man to talk to.
I don't know
about that, Mr. Black.

1205
01:41:07,942 --> 01:41:10,376
But I can tell you what's
happening around here, yeah?
Good.

1206
01:41:10,444 --> 01:41:12,435
Meet my self-appointed
assistant, Abuk.

1207
01:41:12,513 --> 01:41:14,674
Abuk.
Hello. How are you?

1208
01:41:14,749 --> 01:41:17,081
Hello. How are you?
I'm very well.

1209
01:41:17,151 --> 01:41:20,211
Follow me. Come this way.

1210
01:41:20,287 --> 01:41:24,587
Youse need to go
all to the medical center,
quickly as possible.

1211
01:41:30,698 --> 01:41:33,360
I only give the food
to the women, Mr. Black.

1212
01:41:33,434 --> 01:41:37,131
The women make the homes.
The men make the wars... and hooch.

1213
01:41:37,204 --> 01:41:40,503
Adam was God's first draft.
He got it right with Eve.

1214
01:41:40,574 --> 01:41:42,701
You tell that
to your readers, Mr. Black.

1215
01:41:42,777 --> 01:41:45,143
It's a philosophy
that I learned from my wife.

1216
01:41:45,212 --> 01:41:49,478
Cherish her, man. Cherish her.
One of God's finest creations.

1217
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:52,212
Now I'll show you
what the devil's up to.

1218
01:42:09,703 --> 01:42:11,864
Our treatment center.
Pretty crude, isn't it?

1219
01:42:11,939 --> 01:42:14,533
Well, I've seen hospitals
little better. In Nairobi.

1220
01:42:14,608 --> 01:42:19,636
So have I. Gharan, what surprises
have they got in store for us this month?

1221
01:42:19,713 --> 01:42:24,150
Have you checked those things?
Ja? Should be 40 boxes.

1222
01:42:25,753 --> 01:42:29,211
Free medicines, Mr. Black.

1223
01:42:29,290 --> 01:42:31,656
Most of them well beyond
their sell-by date.

1224
01:42:31,725 --> 01:42:35,252
The drug companies donate them.
It's a tax break for them.

1225
01:42:35,329 --> 01:42:37,763
Disposable drugs
for disposable patients.

1226
01:42:37,832 --> 01:42:41,529
Out here they have
absolutely no shelf life.

1227
01:42:41,602 --> 01:42:44,935
Safest thing to do
is incinerate them.

1228
01:42:49,076 --> 01:42:53,376
Big pharmaceuticals are right up there
with the arms dealers.

1229
01:42:54,815 --> 01:42:57,340
This is how the world
fucks Africa, Mr. Black.

1230
01:42:57,418 --> 01:43:00,876
Blood on their hands?
It's how they expiate their guilt.

1231
01:43:00,955 --> 01:43:04,413
Pharmaceuticals,
the aid agencies, everybody.

1232
01:43:04,492 --> 01:43:07,928
This whole machine
is driven by guilt.

1233
01:43:07,995 --> 01:43:10,225
Is it?

1234
01:43:10,297 --> 01:43:13,061
And now you will sample
my goat stew. Come with me.

1235
01:43:18,138 --> 01:43:20,299
So tell me, Robert,

1236
01:43:20,374 --> 01:43:23,002
Do you believe an individual
can redeem himselfby good acts?

1237
01:43:23,077 --> 01:43:25,011
Abuk.

1238
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:27,741
I do, yes.

1239
01:43:27,815 --> 01:43:30,545
Maybe the redemption
is in the struggle, huh?

1240
01:43:30,618 --> 01:43:33,644
God has your head.
The devil has your balls.

1241
01:43:33,721 --> 01:43:36,053
So which particular devil had yours?

1242
01:43:36,123 --> 01:43:38,489
Oh, you don't want to know
about that, Robert.

1243
01:43:38,559 --> 01:43:40,754
What's your paper
really interested in?

1244
01:43:40,828 --> 01:43:43,626
In the big
pharmaceutical companies.

1245
01:43:43,697 --> 01:43:47,394
African guinea pigs.
Cheap trials for unsound drugs.

1246
01:43:47,468 --> 01:43:50,335
Uninformed consent extorted
with threats against children.
Who are you?

1247
01:43:50,404 --> 01:43:52,338
Christ!
Payoffs, cover-ups.

1248
01:43:52,406 --> 01:43:54,840
You were in Nairobi.
At the hospital.
Unmarked graves.

1249
01:43:54,909 --> 01:43:57,343
I knew I'd seen you
somewhere before.
Murder.

1250
01:43:57,411 --> 01:44:00,346
You're the husband.
That's right, Dr. Lorbeer.

1251
01:44:00,414 --> 01:44:03,975
Markus.! Markus.!

1252
01:44:14,562 --> 01:44:17,360
Something's going on out there.
Why did my wife come here?

1253
01:44:17,431 --> 01:44:20,229
She—They had written this report.

1254
01:44:20,301 --> 01:44:23,202
Sixteen pages of inspired guesswork.

1255
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:25,602
I was supposed to provide
the missing clinical data.

1256
01:44:25,673 --> 01:44:28,540
Testify on tape.
And did you?

1257
01:44:28,609 --> 01:44:30,133
This could be a raid.

1258
01:44:39,753 --> 01:44:43,154
Tribesman. Nasty.
They steal cattle, food, children.

1259
01:44:43,223 --> 01:44:46,784
- I think maybe we should leave.
- Did you testify on tape?

1260
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:49,727
She was a very persuasive woman,
your wife, Mr. Quayle.

1261
01:44:49,797 --> 01:44:52,061
And, no, I do not have the tape.
They took the tape.

1262
01:44:52,132 --> 01:44:57,001
But you kept a copy
of the report, yes?
Yes, I did. You're welcome to it.

1263
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:02,671
Level four alert!
They're leaving in five minutes.

1264
01:45:02,743 --> 01:45:07,180
If you don't want to die, my friend,
you'd better come with me to the airstrip.

1265
01:45:07,247 --> 01:45:08,680
Hurry.

1266
01:45:20,728 --> 01:45:24,095
- We can still make it.
- What were Tessa and Bluhm
doing at Lake Turkana?

1267
01:45:24,164 --> 01:45:26,724
Are you crazy?
We've got to get out of here, man.

1268
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,098
I mean, these people,
they kill anybody. Sorry.

1269
01:45:29,169 --> 01:45:31,763
Have you lost your senses?

1270
01:45:31,839 --> 01:45:34,364
- There was something else!
There was a letter!

1271
01:45:34,441 --> 01:45:37,205
Look, you're a lunatic.
Do you know what you're doing?

1272
01:45:37,277 --> 01:45:39,837
You're killing us both.
We'll take our chances with them.

1273
01:47:11,572 --> 01:47:13,699
No!

1274
01:47:50,377 --> 01:47:52,811
- Get down!

1275
01:48:29,416 --> 01:48:30,940
Abuk!

1276
01:48:33,153 --> 01:48:37,522
Abuk.! You okay?
Come with us, quick. Run.

1277
01:48:37,591 --> 01:48:39,115
Run.

1278
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:42,394
Wait. Wait!

1279
01:48:50,337 --> 01:48:53,397
Be careful!
Abuk, be careful!

1280
01:48:53,473 --> 01:48:55,634
Here!

1281
01:49:00,914 --> 01:49:03,348
Hurry on up!
Where have you guys been?

1282
01:49:03,417 --> 01:49:05,578
Sorry about that, Jonah.

1283
01:49:05,652 --> 01:49:09,918
- I'm sorry. I can't take the girl.
- I'm not leaving her.

1284
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:13,016
- We're only allowed to evacuate aid workers.
- Well, to hell with what's allowed.

1285
01:49:13,093 --> 01:49:16,324
I'll— How much do you want for her?

1286
01:49:16,396 --> 01:49:19,923
- Look, there's $800.
- Don't embarrass me.

1287
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,935
You can't buy this. The rules
are made for good reason, please.

1288
01:49:23,003 --> 01:49:25,767
This is a child's life!
There are no rules to cover that!

1289
01:49:25,839 --> 01:49:28,171
Look, there are thousands
of them out there.

1290
01:49:28,242 --> 01:49:30,574
I can't make an exception
for this one child.

1291
01:49:30,644 --> 01:49:34,580
Yes, but this is one we can help! Here.

1292
01:49:34,648 --> 01:49:39,244
Abuk.! Abuk.! Abuk.!

1293
01:49:41,455 --> 01:49:45,152
Listen, that's the way it is here.

1294
01:49:45,225 --> 01:49:47,591
Keep your money.
Strap yourself in, and let's go.

1295
01:50:00,207 --> 01:50:03,973
What— What'll happen to her?

1296
01:50:04,044 --> 01:50:07,707
She might make it to a refugee camp...
if she's lucky.

1297
01:50:36,743 --> 01:50:38,973
This is what you came for,
I believe.

1298
01:50:51,558 --> 01:50:56,655
Your wife would have made that tape public,
Mr. Quayle, with my voice on it.

1299
01:50:56,730 --> 01:50:58,925
That letter was my insurance policy.

1300
01:50:58,999 --> 01:51:02,332
But how did they know
where to find her?

1301
01:51:02,402 --> 01:51:06,862
They were on their way to Marsabit,
taking the whole rotten package
to Grace Makanga.

1302
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:08,931
Makanga would have put it
in front of the U. N.

1303
01:51:09,009 --> 01:51:12,536
But someone knew exactly
where Tessa and Arnold would be.

1304
01:51:15,582 --> 01:51:17,550
That was me.

1305
01:51:17,617 --> 01:51:20,211
I radioed Nairobi.

1306
01:51:20,287 --> 01:51:23,450
KDH security man name of Crick.
God, Christ, man.

1307
01:51:23,523 --> 01:51:26,492
I didn't know they
were gonna be murdered.

1308
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,960
My oath to God.

1309
01:51:30,964 --> 01:51:34,024
Crick's going to know
that you were up here.

1310
01:51:34,101 --> 01:51:36,968
Going to be very interested
to know where you're headed.

1311
01:51:37,037 --> 01:51:39,699
What do I tell him?

1312
01:51:41,274 --> 01:51:43,572
He'll know.

1313
01:51:43,643 --> 01:51:46,441
He's been there before.

1314
01:51:47,981 --> 01:51:49,915
Mr. Andika?
Yeah?

1315
01:51:49,983 --> 01:51:53,817
I'd like to apologize
if I embarrassed you earlier.

1316
01:51:53,887 --> 01:51:56,082
It's all right.

1317
01:51:56,156 --> 01:52:00,820
Do you think that it would be possible
to land the plane here?

1318
01:52:00,894 --> 01:52:04,694
Lake Turkana? It's possible,
but you don't wanna go there.

1319
01:52:04,765 --> 01:52:06,995
It's—There's nothing there
but crocodiles.

1320
01:52:07,067 --> 01:52:09,331
Let me take you back to Loki.

1321
01:52:09,403 --> 01:52:11,633
Well, l— I wouldn't be alone for long.

1322
01:52:11,705 --> 01:52:15,106
Please. I'd be, um— I'd be grateful.

1323
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:19,108
I have one more favor
to ask you, I'm sorry.

1324
01:52:19,179 --> 01:52:22,012
Do you think you could post
that envelope for me?
It's quite urgent.

1325
01:52:22,082 --> 01:52:23,777
Ah, Rome.

1326
01:53:50,537 --> 01:53:54,701
If we have lost in Justin and Tessa...

1327
01:53:54,774 --> 01:53:57,299
Two valued friends,

1328
01:53:57,377 --> 01:54:02,713
The diplomatic community
has lost a true gentleman—

1329
01:54:02,782 --> 01:54:05,774
Courteous, self-effacing,

1330
01:54:07,287 --> 01:54:10,450
Large ofheart.

1331
01:54:10,524 --> 01:54:15,757
That he chose to take his own life
in the same remote spot...

1332
01:54:15,829 --> 01:54:19,458
Where Tessa met her tragic death...

1333
01:54:19,533 --> 01:54:23,663
Is a sad reflection
ofhis tormented state of mind...

1334
01:54:23,737 --> 01:54:27,605
But also typical ofhis discretion.

1335
01:54:29,309 --> 01:54:33,006
He would not have had us troubled.

1336
01:54:33,079 --> 01:54:37,539
He would not have had us inconvenienced.

1337
01:54:37,617 --> 01:54:41,747
Nothing in his life became him...

1338
01:54:41,821 --> 01:54:44,346
Like the leaving it.

1339
01:54:54,634 --> 01:55:00,038
I have, uh, chosen a text I know
Justin and Tessa would approve.

1340
01:55:00,106 --> 01:55:03,769
It's an epistle.
Noncanonical.

1341
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:12,279
"My Dear Sandy:
Your naiveté is beyond belief.

1342
01:55:12,352 --> 01:55:16,220
"Knowing our arrangements
with KDH and ThreeBees,

1343
01:55:16,289 --> 01:55:18,621
"you send me
this half-baked report...

1344
01:55:18,692 --> 01:55:21,923
"by some bleeding heart
diplomatic wife and her black lover...

1345
01:55:21,995 --> 01:55:24,327
"and ask me to take action.

1346
01:55:24,397 --> 01:55:28,561
"The only action required,
apart from shredding the thing,

1347
01:55:28,635 --> 01:55:32,332
"is to keep a tighter rein
on your resident harlot.

1348
01:55:32,405 --> 01:55:37,707
"I want to know what she does,
where she goes, whom she meets.

1349
01:55:37,777 --> 01:55:41,008
"The issue here is deniability.

1350
01:55:41,081 --> 01:55:44,244
"If nobody told us
Dypraxa was causing deaths,

1351
01:55:44,317 --> 01:55:46,615
"we can't be held responsible.

1352
01:55:46,686 --> 01:55:50,019
"But, my dear Sandy,
should it ever become known...

1353
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:52,251
"that we've closed our eyes to the deaths,

1354
01:55:52,325 --> 01:55:55,226
"none of us would survive the scandal.

1355
01:55:55,295 --> 01:55:58,230
"I still have great hopes of you.
My love to Gloria.

1356
01:55:58,298 --> 01:56:01,529
Yours Sincerely, Bernard."

1357
01:56:01,601 --> 01:56:05,867
This way, sir.
What do you have to say, sir?

1358
01:56:12,445 --> 01:56:15,744
It was a bizarre sort of suicide.

1359
01:56:17,150 --> 01:56:21,177
His body bore no fewer
than eight bullet wounds...

1360
01:56:21,254 --> 01:56:23,188
From three different guns,

1361
01:56:23,256 --> 01:56:26,157
None of which was the one
found in his hand.

1362
01:56:26,226 --> 01:56:28,194
So who has got away with murder?

1363
01:56:29,729 --> 01:56:32,698
Not, of course, the British government.

1364
01:56:32,766 --> 01:56:37,294
They merely covered up,
as one does, the offensive corpses.

1365
01:56:37,370 --> 01:56:42,467
Though not literally. That was done
by person or persons unknown.

1366
01:56:44,110 --> 01:56:47,273
So who has committed murder?

1367
01:56:47,347 --> 01:56:52,410
Not, of course, the highly respectable firm
of KDH Pharmaceutical,

1368
01:56:52,485 --> 01:56:56,421
Which has enjoyed
record profits this quarter...

1369
01:56:56,489 --> 01:56:59,754
And has now licensed ZimbaMed of Harare...

1370
01:56:59,826 --> 01:57:03,819
To continue testing Dypraxa in Africa.

1371
01:57:05,065 --> 01:57:08,626
No, there are no murders in Africa.

1372
01:57:08,702 --> 01:57:11,432
Only regrettable deaths.

1373
01:57:11,504 --> 01:57:16,635
And from those deaths
we derive the benefits of civilization,

1374
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:19,873
Benefits we can afford so easily...

1375
01:57:19,946 --> 01:57:23,677
Because those lives
were bought so cheaply.

1376
01:57:55,115 --> 01:57:58,209
I know all your secrets, Tess.

1377
01:58:01,054 --> 01:58:03,614
I think I understand you now.

1378
01:58:39,626 --> 01:58:41,617
You want me to come home.

1379
01:58:46,866 --> 01:58:49,266
But I am home.

1380
01:59:17,330 --> 01:59:19,389
Mr. Quayle.

1381
01:59:28,007 --> 01:59:29,804
Tess.
