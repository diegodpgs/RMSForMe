00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:57,015
Resync Perfectly By Lurazo
Obviously, I miscalculated a few things.

2
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,042
Eddie

3
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:06,372
I know you're in there,

4
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:17,163
Why is it that, the moment your life
exceeds your wildest dreams...

5
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:20,237
"The Knife" appears in your back.

6
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:27,521
Well, I'll tell you one thing...

7
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:51,698
I will never let them touch me.

8
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:07,975
My neighbor, must have
opened his door to complain.

9
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,152
For a guy with a 4 digit IQ,
I must have missed something...

10
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:19,758
And I hadn't missed much.

11
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,926
I'd come this close to having
an impact in the world.

12
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,168
And now, the only thing
I had an impact on...

13
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,141
was the sidewalk.

14
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:53,320
<i>You see that guy?</i>

15
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:55,529
<i>That was me,
Not so long ago.</i>

16
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:59,746
<i>What kind of guy, without a drug or
alcohol problem looks this way?</i>

17
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:01,451
<i>Only a writer.</i>

18
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:04,951
<i>strangely enough, nobody believed
that I actually had a book contract.</i>

19
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,962
Well it's best rated as a sci-fi novel...

20
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:09,362
but it's really uh, my own
personal manifesto about the plight

21
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:10,911
of the individual in the 21 century.

22
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:15,056
and I sort a created a Utopian society,
where, we all sort of uh uh uh...

23
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:18,516
It's really... It, it's really, it's re-

24
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:23,542
uh.

25
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:27,952
<i>Today was the day,
I was gonna kick its ass</i>

26
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,863
<i>Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go</i>

27
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,176
<i>Man, It's gonna be great.</i>

28
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,492
<i>Just gotta put in the time and
stay in the room.</i>

29
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:41,202
<i>That's the key concept.</i>

30
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,913
<i>Don't leave the room!</i>

31
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:54,051
<i>A few weeks passed this way</i>

32
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,460
<i>Maybe a few months.</i>

33
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,370
<i>At least I still had Lindi.</i>

34
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:06,890
Just like that?

35
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:09,903
Come on, Eddie...

36
00:05:11,308 --> 00:05:12,914
This is hardly a surprise.

37
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:15,422
I, I'm surprised?

38
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,434
Let's just not do this.

39
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:20,644
I am gonna hand in 90 pages
tomorrow on Friday

40
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:21,849
You just wait to see what she says.

41
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,323
- Eddie!
- What?

42
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,180
I know how it's going.

43
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:30,156
I am, I was, your girlfriend.

44
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:34,094
That word doesn't even begin to describe
what you are to me.

45
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:37,106
Partner? Squeeze?

46
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:39,607
Paramour. Inamorata

47
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,230
Cleaning Lady. Bank.

48
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:48,648
Well be there that..

49
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:51,058
Well what's mine is yours too.

50
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,981
and you know that I want to share
the rest of my life with you.

51
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:54,438
- In fact, I was thinking...

52
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,579
- that we should probab...
- Don't propose.

53
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,183
Why not?

54
00:05:58,388 --> 00:06:01,996
Because it worked out so well for you
last time.

55
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,955
<i>it's true, I did marry once,
right out of college - to melissa..</i>

56
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,117
I do!

57
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:07,422
<i>briefly.</i>

58
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,128
<i>This isn't working.</i>

59
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:17,456
Well, even though everything you
said is true, I still love you.

60
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,185
I gotta get back to work.

61
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:28,500
You didn't even tell me
what happened.

62
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:31,612
- I got it!
- You did?

63
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,722
I'm an Editor.

64
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,531
I have my own assistant.
You believe that?

65
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:39,041
Yeah, Of course I believe you.
You deserve it.

66
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:42,455
Thanks.

67
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,009
She was right. Why stick it out?

68
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:59,319
<i>I had clearly missed the on-ramp.</i>

69
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:01,527
<i>We both knew what was beckoning.</i>

70
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,940
<i>The lower bunk
of my childhood bedroom in Jersey.</i>

71
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:07,048
<i>My Father happy to welcome me into</i>

72
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,959
<i>the challenging field of dental
supply inventory.</i>

73
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,367
Eddy Morra!

74
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:17,889
<i>Of all the useless relationships better
forgotten and put away in mothballs</i>

75
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:20,804
<i>Is there any more useless than,
the ex-brother in law?</i>

76
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:22,710
Holy Shit, man!

77
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:24,980
How's it been, like Nine years?

78
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,820
- God!
- Hey!

79
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,439
You alright? You look like you're
livin' on the streets. What's going on?

80
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:37,162
Not much. Uh, I just broke up... What am I,
what's up uh, I'm writing... Writing a lot

81
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:38,669
Oh, you still trying to write?

82
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:40,978
Matter of fact, I have a book contract

83
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,588
- Really? - Yeah.
- That's great.

84
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,996
how about you? Are you uh...
You still dealing?

85
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:49,609
- Do I look like I am still dealing?
- No, you don't. No.

86
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:51,819
Come on, let's get a drink
I wanna hear about this book.

87
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:54,129
I don't know, it's two o'clock
in the afternoon.

88
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,537
When has that ever stopped you?

89
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,849
So.

90
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:04,468
- So...
- How is Melissa doing?

91
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,775
- Here.
- Thanks.

92
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:08,784
Wouldn't know, I don't see you her.

93
00:08:09,284 --> 00:08:10,489
She moved upstate.

94
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,303
She got some kind of Internet,
home-sales kinda job.

95
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:15,808
Couple of kids.

96
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:19,120
Couple of kids... Who's the husband?

97
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:22,132
He walked out on her,
if you really wanna know.

98
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:25,244
But what do you care, man?

99
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,454
You were married for like five minutes.

100
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:31,267
Look, I don't wanna talk about her.
I want to talk about you. Okay?

101
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:32,774
Tell me about this book.
How's it going?

102
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,377
Well it's a... I'm behind.

103
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:42,998
I'm behind on my book,
and uh, It's pretty booked...

104
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:44,854
including my days and nights,
if you really want to know.

105
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,235
- Well, how much have you written on it?
- Not one word.

106
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,149
- Creative problems, um?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:56,164 --> 00:09:00,678
Well I suppose, I can help you with that.
Just this once.

108
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:03,189
Oh, No, no, no...

109
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,497
You don't even know what it is.

110
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:09,613
- You're still dealing.
- Brother, I am light-years from that now.

111
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:13,529
I've been doing some consulting
for a pharmaceutical company.

112
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:16,204
What, like some off-shore lab
making fake Viagra? Come on Vern.

113
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:21,157
No. This is an exclusive product,
that's coming on the stream next year.

114
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,370
They've had clinical tries,
and it's F.D.A. approved.

115
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,883
Alright, just out of curiosity
and that's all...

116
00:09:29,391 --> 00:09:30,094
Let me see it.

117
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,810
What's in it?

118
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:39,930
They've identified these, receptors in
the brain that activate specific circuits.

119
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,827
And you know how they say that we can access

120
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:44,164
only 20% of our brain?

121
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:49,867
Well what this does,
it lets you access all of it.

122
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:52,278
Vernon, look at me.
Do I look good to you?

123
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,285
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass.

124
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:57,112
I don't think that my life's
gonna take some sudden upswing

125
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:59,637
into fame and fortune,
by taking some shiny brain exotic drug.

126
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,617
Get. When?

127
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,826
Tell him we can't do that.

128
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:06,645
No. You tell em.

129
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,546
No. Now!

130
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:15,766
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to leave you here Eddie.

131
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:19,580
But I really, I really do wanna
do this again. So, call me.

132
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:21,688
And, that's on the house.

133
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:23,496
I don't want it.

134
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:25,604
Do not be ungrateful.

135
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:29,520
You know how much that costs?
Eight hundred bucks... A pop.

136
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:32,730
You're welcome.

137
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:45,683
<i>All the way home,
I thought about Melissa.</i>

138
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,196
<i>How could she be a failure too?.</i>

139
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:51,806
<i>She'd been so smart.
Smarter than anyone around her</i>

140
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:55,719
<i>Clearly, there was a direct link
between this Eddie...</i>

141
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,833
<i>Slightly drunk at three o'clock in
the afternoon, and an earlier Eddie.</i>

142
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:00,940
<i>vomiting on his boss' desk...</i>

143
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,951
<i>or stealing his dying aunts Percocet.</i>

144
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:06,763
<i>So who can blame
Lindie for dumping me?</i>

145
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:19,312
<i>In the end, how much worse could it get?</i>

146
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:29,249
<i>I didn't want to see anybody.</i>

147
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:32,761
<i>Especially not
my landlord's nasty young wife</i>

148
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:35,573
- Valerie, Tuesday...
- Look! Enough! Okay...

149
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:37,881
Steve handles the rent,
so you can feed your crap to him!

150
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:39,990
<i>I suddenly had extra reason
to get away from her.</i>

151
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,699
<i>I had thoughtlessly ingested a substance.</i>

152
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,206
Like the rent's not low enough!

153
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:48,522
<i>I had gotten remarkably little information
from Vernon about what this drug would do.</i>

154
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:52,436
you can even be a biker messenger
and come up with that. Really!

155
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:53,843
<i>What if it was a hallucinogen?.</i>

156
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,146
It's pathetic!

157
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,853
<i>Oh my God! Listening to her rag -
If I were tripping, I'd jump out a window</i>

158
00:11:58,888 --> 00:11:59,763
<i>Hello!</i>

159
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:01,070
Are you listening to me?

160
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:03,981
Do you get it?
You are gonna be out on the streets!

161
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,688
<i>And then I felt it.</i>

162
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,317
<i>I was blind, but now I see.</i>

163
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:16,200
- What's wrong?
- What?

164
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:17,831
You don't like me and I don't blame you.

165
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:20,758
You see a self defeating,
energy sucking, piece of shit

166
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,718
who's sponging off your husband...

167
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,042
you're wishing I'd blow my brains out...

168
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:24,548
but my existence
shouldn't make you this upset

169
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:28,261
- What is it?
- That's none of your business!

170
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:29,967
Something wrong in Law school?

171
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:31,273
How do you know I am in law school?

172
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:33,135
People who aren't,
usually don't carry around dry..

173
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:35,527
academically constipated books
about a dead supreme court justice.

174
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:38,501
You are a creep aren't you?
You've been following me.

175
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:39,905
No, I just noticed the book.

176
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:42,616
You just saw the corner of it.
How did you know that?

177
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:46,229
<i>I'd seen it before.
12 years ago in college.</i>

178
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,739
sitting on the couch with a T.A.
I was trying to make...

179
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:52,051
<i>waiting for her coming back out of the
bathroom, hoping she'd have a condom.</i>

180
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,863
<i>Somehow, my unconscious
had served that up.</i>

181
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,970
<i>A memory I'd never even recorded...</i>

182
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:59,983
<i>or was there the whole time and
I all I need was the access?</i>

183
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:02,894
If you're writing a paper,
that's not the book I'd use.

184
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:04,801
Who asked you?

185
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:07,010
Hastings has it's own history.
I'd start there.

186
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,118
Interesting point... Grammatically,
this guy was an idiot

187
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:11,426
which sort of gives credence to the theory
that one of the clerks, he had fired..

188
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:14,035
actually wrote most of
this guy's major opinions.

189
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:17,148
you'd ruler the clerks sons... They'd
love to talk to you; exonerate their dad.

190
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:18,554
that'd give you
something that no one else has...

191
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:21,665
information from the odd museum show...
a half read article,

192
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:22,936
<i>some PBS documentary...</i>

193
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,694
<i>was all bubbling up in my frontal lobes,</i>

194
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,346
<i>mixing itself together</i>

195
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:29,190
<i>into a sparkling cocktail
of useful information.</i>

196
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:31,494
<i>She didn't have a chance.</i>

197
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,409
What, what, what are your suggestions?

198
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:40,633
<i>We'd really worked on her paper too.</i>

199
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,148
<i>In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.</i>

200
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,453
<i>She was pleased.</i>

201
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:52,639
<i>Home...</i>

202
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,390
<i>but it couldn't
be my home, could it!?</i>

203
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:57,199
<i>and who would live like this?</i>

204
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:01,515
<i>My first thought... Torch it!.</i>

205
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:04,326
<i>But, saner heads prevailed.</i>

206
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:41,185
<i>What was this drug?
I couldn't stay messy on it</i>

207
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,879
<i>I hadn't had a cigarette in 6 hours;
hadn't eaten...</i>

208
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,447
<i>So, I'm steamiest and tidy.
What was this?</i>

209
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,558
<i>A drug for people, who wanted
to be more anal retentive?</i>

210
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,113
<i>I wasn't high, wasn't wired...</i>

211
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:56,721
<i>Just clear. I knew what I
needed to do, and how to do it</i>

212
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:37,739
<i>The next morning, I sent a little
probe down into my brain.</i>

213
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:41,956
<i>No surge of brilliance came up
to greet me.</i>

214
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,083
<i>In short, I was back.</i>

215
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:56,008
<i>But something remained</i>

216
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,634
- You're kidding?!
- No

217
00:17:03,236 --> 00:17:06,349
- Words have appeared on paper.
- Yes.

218
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:09,461
- Written by you?
- All you have to do, is to read 3 pages

219
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,178
Just read 3 Pages in the next hour.

220
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,685
and, if you don't want to keep reading,
I'll give you back the advance.

221
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,009
- Okay, Eddie.
- Okay

222
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,228
<i>Eddie, give me a call,
when you get in.</i>

223
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:59,351
<i>Eddie, I am 40 pages further in.
call me.</i>

224
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:02,864
<i>It's, a little grandiose
but I am still reading.</i>

225
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,073
<i>Okay, how did you do this?</i>

226
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:11,686
<i>I really... Call me the minute,
you get in. Call! Okay?</i>

227
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,128
- Who is it?
- Hey, Vernon, its Eddie.

228
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,444
- Eddie who?
- Morra.

229
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:38,860
not a good time, Eddie.

230
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,674
Hey Vern, I really just need
to talk to you.

231
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:52,412
- Vern, what happened?
- Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

232
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,929
So, Eddie, you are interested after all.

233
00:18:57,231 --> 00:18:58,536
That stuff's amazing.

234
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:00,743
Works better, if you're already smart.

235
00:19:01,346 --> 00:19:04,958
- Vernon, who did this to you?
- Trust me, you do not want to know.

236
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,694
- So, uh, what, what's it called?
- Doesn't have a street name yet.

237
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:17,508
But, the boys in the kitchen, are calling it
NZT-48.

238
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,491
The "boys" and, the "kitchen"?

239
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,562
Doesn't sound very, FDA approved Vern.

240
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:28,349
FDA approved. That's a laugh.
You didn't really believe that shit. Did ya?

241
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:32,264
<i>Okay, so what do we have here?</i>

242
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:35,677
<i>some unknown, untested,
possibly dangerous drug</i>

243
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:38,086
<i>scammed out of some
unidentified lab somewhere.</i>

244
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:41,598
<i>given to me by a highly unreliable guy
I hadn't seen in years</i>

245
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:45,213
- So you want some more?
- Yes. Definitely.

246
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:51,035
Alright, we'll talk about it.
But I need a favor first.

247
00:19:51,537 --> 00:19:54,046
Obviously, I'm in no condition
to go out right now

248
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:59,068
So I was wondering if you could pop down to
the uh, dry cleaners; grab my suit for me?

249
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:04,185
And maybe grab a little breakfast for us.

250
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:07,800
<i>He knew, he had me.</i>

251
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:10,107
Sure.

252
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:14,023
<i>From now on, I'd happily be
his errand boy.</i>

253
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,736
<i>Wash his windows, scrub his toilets...</i>

254
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,252
<i>Anything I can do, to get my hands
on this little clear pill</i>

255
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:24,462
<i>that would bring back, enhanced Eddie.</i>

256
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:36,809
Vern?

257
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,454
Vern?

258
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,105
Vern?

259
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:17,212
Oh God.

260
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:41,821
Hey!

261
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:44,355
HEY!

262
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:57,918
<i>911... What's your emergency?</i>

263
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,732
Hi, I need to report uh... A murder?

264
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:06,853
7B, yes.

265
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:11,069
Okay, I'll hold.

266
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,385
<i>It took them forever.</i>

267
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,694
<i>And the longer I stood there,
the clearer I saw</i>

268
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:20,504
<i>Vern had known, whoever had done this</i>

269
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:24,418
<i>And one guess, what they'd
been looking for</i>

270
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:30,844
<i>But had they found it?</i>

271
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:13,707
Shit. If you ever cooked,
I'd be dead too.

272
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:50,247
Police dept! Open the door please.

273
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:56,570
Police dept! Open the door!

274
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:03,697
Open the door please!

275
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:08,314
Police! Open the door!

276
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:10,623
Let's go! Open the door!

277
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:16,044
- Let me see your hands! - I'm the
one who called! - I called you guys!

278
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,569
So you guys tight?
Hang out a lot?

279
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:24,777
No. He's my ex-wife's brother.

280
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,192
I just actually met him on the street
and he asked me to come up.

281
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:31,204
- To buy drugs?
- No, No! What?

282
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:34,918
- What did this guy do?
- I do not know. He was...

283
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:38,932
I heard he was an antiques dealer.

284
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:42,042
- A dealer?
- Yeah uh, Antiques, um...

285
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:43,246
Like uh...

286
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:48,066
Like, Viennese kinda uh,
um chairs and stuff.

287
00:24:49,271 --> 00:24:51,580
like, curly cue leg things.

288
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,783
Yeah?

289
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:57,603
That is correct. An Edward Morra.
He's here.

290
00:24:58,809 --> 00:24:59,914
The victim's sister.

291
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:03,326
<i>I hadn't heard her voice
in ten years.</i>

292
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:07,441
<i>- Eddie?
- Melissa?</i>

293
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:09,249
<i>You were there?</i>

294
00:25:09,957 --> 00:25:15,872
um, just, just before. I had run
into him on the street, and uh, yeah

295
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:17,380
<i>Oh God</i>

296
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:22,097
<i>I wish I was more surprised,
he was involved in some stuff.</i>

297
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:23,504
<i>I better not to say anymore.</i>

298
00:25:23,706 --> 00:25:25,412
No, no, that's probably a good idea.

299
00:25:27,322 --> 00:25:31,233
So uh, we should probably um,
meet or something, right...

300
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:35,247
<i>No, I gotta do the funeral
and God knows what else...</i>

301
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:38,058
<i>We can't meet, okay?</i>

302
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,570
Right. I guess I'll just see
you at the funeral then. uh?

303
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:43,289
<i>No! I don't, I don't want that.
Please don't.</i>

304
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,446
I call you at the point okay,
when this is over

305
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:47,394
Okay. Alright

306
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:48,395
Okay.

307
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:59,141
You know, something doesn't gel here.
Write down your number.

308
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:01,550
I'll need it to contact you later.

309
00:26:34,274 --> 00:26:35,378
<i>Worth the risk?</i>

310
00:26:42,104 --> 00:26:43,209
<i>What would you do?</i>

311
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:17,839
<i>Vern's cash, combined with
an unprecedented surge in motivation</i>

312
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:20,651
<i>enabled me to finish the book in 4 days</i>

313
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:35,909
<i>A tablet a day, and what I could do
with my day, was limitless.</i>

314
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,617
<i>In learned
to play the piano in 3 days.</i>

315
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:44,942
<i>Math became useful
And fun...</i>

316
00:27:46,444 --> 00:27:47,447
All in.

317
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:54,251
<i>Even half listing to any language,
I became fluent.</i>

318
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:04,316
So that Shakespeare's text,
it is polite mediocrity.

319
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:05,725
who'd ever argue with you?

320
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:08,835
<i>This was great.</i>

321
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:13,050
So mom, I've been doing a little
research on aunt Helen's tumor. And...

322
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:16,364
it's totally clear, that anybody
with Familial Adomis Phalacrosis...

323
00:28:16,665 --> 00:28:18,572
should be supplementing
Platinum doublet regiments...

324
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:19,878
with lico cimpenti oic acid.

325
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,888
<i>I suddenly knew everything;
about everything.</i>

326
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,093
Sure dude! You'd get a short term spike...

327
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:26,902
but wouldn't that rapid expansion
devalue the stock completely in two years?

328
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:27,909
No, cause there are safeguards.

329
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,495
Against the aggressive over expansion?

330
00:28:29,496 --> 00:28:31,671
There aren't. Cause there
are no safeguards in Human nature.

331
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,630
Oh, we're wired to overreach.

332
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:35,736
look at history... All the countries
that ever ruled the world...

333
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:37,528
Portugal with his big massive navy.

334
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,422
All they got now are salt Cod
and cheap condoms.

335
00:28:39,423 --> 00:28:41,079
The Brits!
Now they're just sitting in their dank

336
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,405
little isle and fussing over their suits.

337
00:28:42,406 --> 00:28:44,123
No-one stopping and thinking...
Hey! We're doing pretty well.

338
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,490
We got France. We got Poland.
We got a big Swiss bank account

339
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,417
You know what...
Let's not invade Russia in the winter.

340
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:50,976
Let's go home. Let's pop a beer.
Let's live off the interest.

341
00:28:52,602 --> 00:28:53,304
Yeah.

342
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:55,312
<i>My brain was just pouring this stuff out.</i>

343
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:59,121
<i>Everything I'd ever read, heard,
seen was now organized and available</i>

344
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:00,832
<i>here it is, here you go</i>

345
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:02,738
Eddie! Hey...

346
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,849
Listen, I'm sure you have a portfolio
but if don't...

347
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,255
I'd be very interested working with you.

348
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,764
Okay, Kevin.

349
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:12,776
<i>I made some new friends
who invited me to the beach.</i>

350
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,788
<i>The beach, was not nearby.</i>

351
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:31,147
<i>All my fear, all my shyness, gone!</i>

352
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:35,565
<i>But mere lounging wasn't enough.</i>

353
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:04,373
<i>only problem,
if I wasn't moving forward</i>

354
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:06,080
<i>I felt like I was going to explode</i>

355
00:30:09,494 --> 00:30:11,804
- Anybody ever jumped?
- Are you crazy?

356
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:18,530
- He is gonna do it.
- He's not gonna do it.

357
00:30:20,338 --> 00:30:21,542
Oh my God!

358
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:41,016
<i>And then I began to form, an idea.</i>

359
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,229
<i>Suddenly, I knew exactly
what I needed do.</i>

360
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,738
<i>It wasn't writing.
It wasn't books.</i>

361
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:48,846
<i>It was much bigger than that</i>

362
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:53,563
<i>But it will take money to get there.</i>

363
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,085
In a down market, no-one was making much.

364
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,198
<i>But, no one had NZT.</i>

365
00:31:15,949 --> 00:31:19,563
<i>Armed Vern's last 800 Dollars,
I made $2,000 in a day.</i>

366
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:23,376
<i>Next day, 7500</i>

367
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:24,983
<i>It was too slow</i>

368
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:27,190
<i>I'd need more capital.</i>

369
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:29,800
<i>Banks weren't lending to guys like me.</i>

370
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:33,313
That's him in the corner back there.

371
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:52,186
So, uh...Liv told you that, I'm looking
for a short-term loan?

372
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:54,294
Yeah, and I told them that - forget it.

373
00:31:54,896 --> 00:31:55,799
Why?

374
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:59,514
Because I don't see you before,
and I don't like you already

375
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:02,224
Why do I give you $100,000 Dollars?

376
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,760
Because...

377
00:32:05,761 --> 00:32:08,982
I quintupled
my money 4 days in a row.

378
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:13,366
- So you got a fix on the game?
- No, not a fix.

379
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,478
I was able to calculate certain patterns
in the algorithms.

380
00:32:16,778 --> 00:32:19,188
If you look at column 4,
This was the first...

381
00:32:22,202 --> 00:32:23,106
You're good.

382
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:27,622
Okay, its a fix.

383
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:31,535
Yea, and all you people get caught.
What are you gonna do then?

384
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:35,007
Well it's not as I if have a
black book with your name in it...

385
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:36,318
If that's what you're talking about.

386
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:39,031
...and besides, I get the strong feeling...

387
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:41,406
that, you're not somebody I want to disappoint.

388
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:49,411
Don't get up. I said
don't get up. Sit down!

389
00:32:49,412 --> 00:32:50,385
Okay.

390
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:56,143
Okay, you take this, you're
mine. - okay - You understand?

391
00:32:56,747 --> 00:32:58,154
you don't pay...
You know what we do?

392
00:32:58,955 --> 00:33:00,361
I cut you at waist.

393
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:03,874
peel your skin up over
your head and tie a knot in it

394
00:33:04,978 --> 00:33:07,689
You don't die from this, You suffocate

395
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:09,696
Good luck.

396
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:20,739
<i>My new friend, Kevin Doyle,
showed me how you can leverage.</i>

397
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,450
<i>two and a half times your cash
at day trading firm</i>

398
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:26,359
<i>I've been upping the dose for over a week.</i>

399
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,577
<i>It seemed to cut my learning curve.</i>

400
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:48,544
Hey, Why you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted

401
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:51,755
But not for the big fat defensive
contract he bribed his way into

402
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:52,759
That's still on

403
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,968
should be announced next week

404
00:33:55,004 --> 00:33:56,875
<i>I was jacked in, booted up.</i>

405
00:33:57,377 --> 00:33:59,084
<i>At the end of week,
My brokerage account.</i>

406
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,292
<i>contained over two million dollars.</i>

407
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:04,104
<i>word, quickly got out.</i>

408
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:12,936
<i>You have 19 messages.</i>

409
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:15,646
<i>four job offers,
My bank raising my line of credit</i>

410
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:17,554
<i>a reporter from the New York Post...</i>

411
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,866
Really call me back Mr. Morra.
No one makes money that fast

412
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,477
<i>This Article's gonna get written -
with or without you.</i>

413
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:26,488
<i>And finally, Kevin Doyle,
trying to sound casual.</i>

414
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:30,905
<i>Eddie, I was talking you up to my boss
and well, the impossible happened bud.</i>

415
00:34:31,407 --> 00:34:33,614
But we got you a meeting with Karl van Loon.

416
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:36,125
Karl van Loon wants
to meet you?

417
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:37,831
apparently so.

418
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,838
But you are not in the finance game?

419
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:42,348
What can you do for Karl van Loon?

420
00:35:03,628 --> 00:35:05,033
Since when do you speak Italian?

421
00:35:07,143 --> 00:35:08,447
Self improvement month.

422
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,058
I guess uh, somebody gave me a wakeup call.

423
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:14,771
- I hope you didn't do it for me.
- No, I just wanted to apologize to you.

424
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:21,597
And that you know, that apparently, my capacity
for self-sabotage wasn't boundless after all.

425
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:26,414
The real question is...
Why did you ever put up with me?

426
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,126
I was in love with you.

427
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:39,467
- So when does the book come out?
- Next year. How's your new assistant?

428
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:40,570
She's Good.

429
00:35:48,294 --> 00:35:51,711
You know, I'm really
happy you're here with me.

430
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:55,728
I'm proud of you.

431
00:35:57,935 --> 00:35:59,541
And...

432
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,269
a little intimidated.

433
00:36:08,274 --> 00:36:09,579
<i>We started up again</i>

434
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,994

Okay, give me that.

00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:40,894
- He's god!?
- You coming over later?

442
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:43,804
I can't. I don't have a key.

443
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:45,610
Oh that's right.

444
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:47,418
Can I have it back?

445
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,028
- No
- No?

446
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:52,438
I mean, does it have to be that key?
Can it be a new key?

447
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,649
to our place?

448
00:36:57,658 --> 00:36:59,063
It'll be cost-effective.

449
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:01,372
And you say I am not practical.

450
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:14,620
Can I walk you to work?

Nothing.

453
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,016
You should sleep.

Here he is. Nice Article in the post buddy.

460
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,413
He is on his way.

00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:34,125
Now be warned, he's mercurial.

462
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:37,237
One minute your best friend,
the next, you're a leper.

463
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,345
And he needs direct answers.

464
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:41,955
Anything tentative,
and you've lost him forever.

465
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:45,568
I think we should rehearse a few scenarios.

466
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,274
I am eating, Kevin.

467
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,385
Hey! Are you up for this?

468
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,997
You sure?
Because I got a little bit on the line here.

469
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,004
Have a toast plate.

470
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:03,637
Hey, Karl. Good to see you.

471
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,344
How are ya?

472
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:16,384
So, Eddie Morra,
What's your secret?

473
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:17,992
Medication.

474
00:39:18,795 --> 00:39:20,201
I'm on a special medication.

475
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:22,007
okay.

476
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:26,751
There's a formula with a complex method-

477
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:29,370
but of course, research was a component;
massive research

478
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:32,202
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA in
every company I bought.

479
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,257
Papers stacked like the Himalayas
in my office. And you know what?

480
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,868
- The stocks went up.
- by a hair.

481
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:40,391
Sure, the stocks rose,
but who wants to do all that work,

482
00:39:40,392 --> 00:39:41,552
for a shitty little uptake?

483
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:44,593
It's not the visceral kind of spike
you want in short-time holding. So...

484
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,609
I dispensed with all the hard statics
and I went right to the rumor mill

485
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:52,022
So your bought your stocks based on
what the tom-toms beating in the street?

486
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,335
Sure. The share prices aren't really based
on how a company works

487
00:39:55,637 --> 00:39:56,840
it's about how mass psychology works

488
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:59,452
So, if I found certain algorithms
in the perception of the stock...

489
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:01,961
Pattern recognition.
That's your cycle help?

490
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:04,070
Well, not everybody understands the patterns.

491
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:06,780
and that gave me a little bit more of
an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick.

492
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:08,385
so then I went to door number 3

493
00:40:08,786 --> 00:40:11,698
You're really implying that you've,
some sort of ultimate formula?

494
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,212
Well, from 12,000
to 2.3 million in ten days.

495
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,320
I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.

496
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:18,825
delusions of grandeur

497
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:22,239
I don't have delusions of grandeur
I have an actual recipe for grandeur.

498
00:40:26,152 --> 00:40:28,261
I do not know who you are Eddie,
or what your game is,

499
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:30,669
But I'm sure of one thing,
you don't work in my world.

500
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:32,676
I'm up to my ass with investment guys...

501
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:35,388
and you don't have the half terrified,
half cocky line of crap; which is,

502
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,299
not to say, that I like yours any better,

503
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,113
but you obviously pick your stocks
in a way that I haven't seen before.

504
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,226
Take a look at these companies
and tell me what you think.

505
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:48,038
- Right now?
- Yeah. Take your time.

506
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,152
Sure.

507
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:06,908
These companies aren't the question, are they?

508
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,123
Explain.

509
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,133
Unless you're playing both sides of the fence.

510
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,844
control the whole power enchilada...

511
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:18,452
But no, these companies
wouldn't get you there in a merging markets

512
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:19,160
You would have...

513
00:41:19,164 --> 00:41:23,675
Oh whoa! Whoa, this must be some, big-ass
merger you're contemplating

514
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:29,095
And there's really only one company
with enough bling to justify a merger

515
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:30,901
with Van Loon and associations.

516
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,311
Who've you been talking to?

517
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:36,120
Oh, I am just connecting the dots.
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?

518
00:41:37,526 --> 00:41:40,739
Well you're an amazing con artist,
or you're a very smart young man...

519
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,047
I mean, come on! The two of you together...

520
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,561
The whole world will have to come begging for energy

521
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:47,686
like Oliver Twist and his bowl of Gruel.

522
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:50,074
Well now you're going backwards. What else you got?

523
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:51,479
A prediction.

524
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,790
- It won't come off. - Why's that?
- You'd have to back off Libya

525
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:57,803
Really?

526
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,316
But, you don't want hear this from some schmuck
who needs a ride home.

527
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:03,926
Alright. You get your shot.

528
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:06,502
Meet me tomorrow at the Saint Regis at 10

529
00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:08,416
and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck who needs a ride home,

530
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:10,286
would restructure these deals.

531
00:42:10,452 --> 00:42:12,959
- And you better be prepared.
- I am at your disposal.

532
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,070
You don't really live here, do you?

533
00:42:15,772 --> 00:42:18,081
Well, um Spart's weren't big on amenities.

534
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:20,591
Yea, and they eventually got their asses kicked.

535
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:33,038
<i>I didn't go in. I wanted to walk,
move, digest, ingest</i>

536
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:35,053
<i>There are moments in life</i>

537
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:38,359
<i>moments, when you know, you've crossed
a bridge. Your old life is over.</i>

538
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,068
<i>Van Loon was my bridge.
I finally had my shot.</i>

539
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,177
<i>Wall Street would provide my nest egg.</i>

540
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:44,784
<i>but then how far could I go?</i>

541
00:42:45,484 --> 00:42:48,296
<i>CEO? A global force? Maybe president.</i>

542
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:51,809
<i>time, somebody shook up the free world
and got the things done.</i>

543
00:43:03,955 --> 00:43:08,773
<i>Suddenly, there was another skip.</i>

544
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:11,583
How have I gone the last 20 blocks?

545
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,410
<i>I got another 10 blocks</i>

546
00:43:17,522 --> 00:43:18,527
<i>...and then...</i>

547
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:22,528
I was way up town.

548
00:45:05,464 --> 00:45:07,772
<i>a fight? I don't know how to fight.</i>

549
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:09,980
<i>or do I?</i>

550
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,629
<i>if your assailants do not stop,
your insistence will distract the attacker.</i>

551
00:45:50,736 --> 00:45:53,645
<i>off balancing your opponent,
can make use of his momentum</i>

552
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,410
<i>What bar was this?</i>

553
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,954
<i>When it finally stopped</i>

554
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:30,074
<i>I couldn't account for
the last 18 hours in my life</i>

555
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:55,575
<i>Hey, it's me.
I thought you were coming over.</i>

556
00:46:56,232 --> 00:47:00,510
<i>Is everything okay?
Call me when you get this.</i>

557
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,673
<i>Even off NZT, I decided
to give Van Loon's files a shot.</i>

558
00:47:51,014 --> 00:47:53,310
<i>they were hieroglyphs.</i>

559
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:59,083
<i>- Hello?
- Kevin, it's Eddie.</i>

560
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:00,017
Eddie?

561
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:02,434
<i>Listen, I can't - I can't make the meeting today.</i>

562
00:48:02,473 --> 00:48:03,439
What are you talking about?

563
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:06,052
I can't come in today.
I'm sick.

564
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:09,703
Yeah? Well, you can't have the flu right now.
He'll never give you this chance again.

565
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,901
I know. Listen. I just, ah...

566
00:48:12,005 --> 00:48:14,827
I have all this data to analyze.

567
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:18,421
<i>What have you been doing
for the last day?</i>

568
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:22,584
Don't you get it? This is your test.

569
00:48:23,062 --> 00:48:26,058
Yeah. Well, I can't pass the test right now.

570
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:27,841
And how am I gonna look if you don't?

571
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:33,859
- I know. Listen... - Sh! Listen to me. Pull
yourself together - get down to the meeting

572
00:48:40,825 --> 00:48:43,967
Okay. Okay. I, I, I, I'll
be there. I'll be there.

573
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,061
- Hey. How are you, Eddie?
- Good to see you again.

574
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:11,758
Sit down.

575
00:49:15,964 --> 00:49:17,691
- What do you know about Hank Atwood?
- Atwood...

576
00:49:17,962 --> 00:49:22,296
Atwood... Um, He's an iconoclast...

577
00:49:22,298 --> 00:49:28,384
uhm... He owns about a half of Colorado...

578
00:49:29,942 --> 00:49:31,564
So, this is "prepared"? Eddie.

579
00:49:33,632 --> 00:49:36,821
What is this, Atwood 101? I mean...
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?

580
00:49:36,823 --> 00:49:38,721
Where was he two years ago?

581
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,936
Hm?

582
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,065
Nowhere.

583
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,204
Two years ago,
he wasn't even on Forbes radar.

584
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:51,830
That was a great leap forward.

585
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:52,830
Right?

586
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:54,657
I'm baffled by this guy...

587
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,801
Comes out of nowhere, so strong... Has me on the
run, before I could even get to anybody in his camp.

588
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:03,166
beats me out of two properties,
investment companies up north...

589
00:50:11,919 --> 00:50:13,916
<i>We're here in the front of the hotel
where a woman...</i>

590
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:18,088
<i>identified as Maria Winberg,
was found dead in her room last night.</i>

591
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:20,299
<i>a victim of foul play..</i>

592
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,606
<i>Miss Winberg was a well known socialite...</i>

593
00:50:24,427 --> 00:50:27,824
<i>but was also known
for her dedicated charity work around the city.</i>

594
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,929
<i>Police spent hours, questioning hotel staff
and patrons.</i>

595
00:50:32,117 --> 00:50:34,780
<i>and an eye witness reported seeing a man
leaving the scene.</i>

596
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:37,010
How can we convince him
that I can raise his game?

597
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:37,725
Got any ideas?

598
00:50:39,401 --> 00:50:40,401
What do you think?

599
00:50:42,534 --> 00:50:43,534
Hm?

600
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:53,163
You're not one of those kind of guys - are you Eddy?

601
00:50:54,203 --> 00:50:56,488
we lose you, if there's a screen in the room?

602
00:50:58,376 --> 00:51:00,880
These are tectonic plates
that are shifting right under us.

603
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,415
Pardon me one second.

604
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:28,728
<i>Was it possible?
Could I have killed someone?</i>

605
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,145
<i>Was is it even me?</i>

606
00:51:37,459 --> 00:51:39,522
<i>Eddie? This is Melissa..</i>

607
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:43,907
Listen... Vernon hasn't been giving you
anything-has he? Because that stuff is dangerous.

608
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:45,468
Melissa?

609
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:49,089
Hey. Do you think we can meet somewhere?
I really need to talk to you

610
00:51:49,222 --> 00:51:50,383
<i>we're talking now.</i>

611
00:51:50,747 --> 00:51:53,522
No no, let's meet at uh,
Billy's on Grant... At noon?

612
00:51:54,206 --> 00:51:55,404
<i>You can't see me Eddie.</i>

613
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:58,819
Please please come. Please come.

614
00:51:59,888 --> 00:52:02,446
It's important. I really need to know
what you're talking about.

615
00:52:05,712 --> 00:52:08,155
<i>I realized, that there were other people,
who I might now about NZT.</i>

616
00:52:09,225 --> 00:52:10,388
<i>Vern's other clients.</i>

617
00:52:51,024 --> 00:52:52,885
Yeah, Hi.
May I please speak with Jerry Braden?

618
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,831
<i>Jerry's in the hospital..</i>

619
00:52:55,122 --> 00:52:57,537
<i>- He's what?
- Yeah, he's not doing well at all</i>

620
00:52:57,538 --> 00:52:59,323
Yeah, hello. Is Paul Kaplan there?

621
00:52:59,324 --> 00:53:05,656
<i>Ah, no. No he's not.
uh, uh, Paul passed away - uh, three days ago</i>

622
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,502
Oh my God! I'm so sorry.

623
00:53:08,503 --> 00:53:11,171
<i>Yeah, he started getting headaches,
then he collapsed at work.</i>

624
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:12,706
<i>Now he's in the I.C.U..</i>

625
00:53:12,707 --> 00:53:15,028
Okay, well please give him my best.
thank you.

626
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:16,821
<i>Of all the people
I called...</i>

627
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:20,439
<i>three were dead,
and the rest were sick.</i>

628
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,742
<i>Hello</i>

629
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:47,278
Hello?

630
00:54:34,328 --> 00:54:36,410
Go! GO!

631
00:55:05,278 --> 00:55:06,015
Eddie.

632
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:09,199
Melissa.

633
00:55:17,412 --> 00:55:19,460
Hey.

634
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,949
Do not tell me I look good like this,
I know.

635
00:55:28,017 --> 00:55:29,770
I didn't want you to see me this way.

636
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:32,156
You look good.

637
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,747
Well I uh...

638
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,167
Yes, I sorta got myself together.

639
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,075
NZT will do that to you..

640
00:55:39,828 --> 00:55:42,371
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I took it too.

641
00:55:44,445 --> 00:55:47,020
- Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
- No

642
00:55:47,051 --> 00:55:50,734
What, when we he told me about this amazing new drug...
I was like, "down the hatch. "

643
00:55:50,735 --> 00:55:52,505
and it was. It was amazing.

644
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:57,084
I read Brian Green's, The Elegant Universe -
in 45 minutes

645
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,283
and I understood it.

646
00:55:58,284 --> 00:56:01,365
My, my work rate increased,
just as insanely overnight...

647
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:02,983
and my boss started to hate me

648
00:56:04,937 --> 00:56:09,772
They offered me his job.
And then, then I got, I got scared.

649
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:11,295
Why?

650
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:13,196
Why? Because I am not stupid.

651
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:16,153
Nobody can operate at that level
of mental activity and not crash.

652
00:56:19,383 --> 00:56:20,605
I stopped taking it.

653
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:23,557
- Then?
- Then I got sick.

654
00:56:23,558 --> 00:56:31,082
Headaches, throwing up
So I went back to, Veron...

655
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:32,895
he told me about all the people that were dying.

656
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:38,012
- How much you have been taking Eddie?
- I've been taking a lot.

657
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:40,845
Well maybe...

658
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:47,394
Maybe they've worked out the bugs maybe.
Maybe this is a different batch.

659
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:48,985
Yeah.

660
00:56:49,598 --> 00:56:52,855
- You're off it right now, aren't you?
- Just finish the story.

661
00:56:52,856 --> 00:56:56,556
Well, I didn't take anymore and I didn't die

662
00:56:58,225 --> 00:56:59,298
But after a while I realized

663
00:56:59,299 --> 00:57:02,255
that I couldn't
concentrate on anything for longer than 10 minutes..

664
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:04,472
I missed deadlines...

665
00:57:04,945 --> 00:57:07,395
Got lazy. Slow. So slow.

666
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:14,278
That was two years ago.
I haven't been the same since.

667
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,348
You have some left? Good.

668
00:57:23,697 --> 00:57:25,618
Well you go home and you take it.
You take the dose down,

669
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,985
But you don't just stop.
You'll die, if you just stop!

670
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,950
Try to taper off. Otherwise,

671
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:33,375
the headaches are just beginning.

672
00:57:36,388 --> 00:57:37,696
I have to go.

673
00:57:39,573 --> 00:57:41,444
- Do you know who makes them?
- I do not know.

674
00:57:43,725 --> 00:57:45,371
I have to go.

675
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:19,788
Oh Shit! Listen listen listen listen...

676
00:58:20,657 --> 00:58:22,313
- You forget about me eh?
- No no no

677
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,155
12:00 and you're not here!

678
00:58:24,156 --> 00:58:25,525
- I'm here now.

679
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,767
- Come on, keep going.
- I can to write you a check.

680
00:58:31,729 --> 00:58:32,729
Check.

681
00:58:33,067 --> 00:58:33,505
Check

682
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,094
Are you out of your mind?

683
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,579
What do you think I am,
some financial institution?

684
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,599
Alright. You're right.
Maybe at least you can go to the bank.

685
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,448
What you got there?

686
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:54,300
- What is it?
- It's just aspirin.

687
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:56,600
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see.

688
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,633
I feel good man, what's in this stuff?

689
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:25,520
Well, it's just some vitamins and aspirin.

690
00:59:25,848 --> 00:59:28,044
You're full of shit Eddie baby...

691
00:59:58,135 --> 00:59:58,898
I'm sorry

692
00:59:59,698 --> 01:00:02,770
- Tyler, I gotta go.
- I'm sick.

693
01:00:05,925 --> 01:00:08,176
I'm sorry!
I couldn't make it home.

694
01:00:08,879 --> 01:00:11,552
- I'll take you to a hospital.
- No no no no, honey...

695
01:00:12,194 --> 01:00:16,662
I need yo to get...
It's really simple baby. I need my pills.

696
01:00:17,286 --> 01:00:20,739
- Eddie, what pills? - Baby, it's
complicated. - What are you taking?

697
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,520
Are you on drugs?

698
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:29,257
<i>I had no choice.
I told Lindi everything</i>

699
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:36,360
So all this energy of yours,
all this focus, has been a drug?

700
01:00:36,361 --> 01:00:38,121
Well, it was supposed to be legal.

701
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:42,163
I, I have a supply stashed.

702
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,594
- you want me to go get it.
- No.

703
01:00:46,591 --> 01:00:48,799
No no no. I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go get it.

704
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,444
Give me your keys.
I'll go to your apartment.

705
01:00:51,445 --> 01:00:54,979
It's not in my apartment.
I moved it.

706
01:00:55,744 --> 01:00:58,353
Okay... So where did you move it?

707
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,275
In my house.

708
01:01:09,843 --> 01:01:11,490
Unbelievable!

709
01:01:25,426 --> 01:01:27,830
- Have you got it?
- Yeah.

710
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:31,622
There's someone following me.

711
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,435
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

712
01:01:35,604 --> 01:01:38,827
He got into the cab behind me,
and he's making every turn I'm making.

713
01:01:39,234 --> 01:01:40,318
Better call the cops.

714
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:42,591
Can you go around him?

715
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:46,273
<i>- Baby, what's happening?
- We're stopped dead.</i>

716
01:01:47,678 --> 01:01:48,725
He's getting out...

717
01:01:50,066 --> 01:01:52,157
Eddie, he's walking over here.

718
01:01:52,516 --> 01:01:53,161
Lindi...

719
01:01:54,765 --> 01:01:55,238
Oh God!

720
01:02:10,744 --> 01:02:11,105
Help!

721
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,105
Help!

722
01:02:15,263 --> 01:02:19,860
This man, this man is chasing me.
He followed me from my building.

723
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,163
I don't know him. Please!

724
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,597
Yo buddy! Let's leave her alone.

725
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:29,173
Are you deaf?
I said, leave her alone!

726
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:33,937
Hey buddy, are you trying to piss me off?

727
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:37,500
What are you doing, man?

728
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,659
<i>- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here. What happened?</i>

729
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:15,520
- I'm stuck! He'll find me.
- Okay, stop talking. Don't move...

730
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:17,715
- He killed two guys.
- What?

731
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,971
He's gonna kill me too.

732
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:23,224
No no no no no. Let me look.
Can you see him?

733
01:03:27,134 --> 01:03:28,481
No.

734
01:03:30,013 --> 01:03:31,000
Nothin'.

735
01:03:32,522 --> 01:03:33,911
I don't know what to do.

736
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,815
Okay... I need you to go into the bag
and take one of the pills.

737
01:03:39,555 --> 01:03:40,600
Why?

738
01:03:41,499 --> 01:03:43,573
<i>Because you'll know what to do.
You'll take it and then you'll know.</i>

739
01:03:43,713 --> 01:03:47,380
He's got a knife. Eddie,
I can't think my way out of a knife.

740
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:50,450
Just listen to me. It'll come on in 30 seconds,

741
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,768
and you'll think your way out. That's what it does.

742
01:04:16,091 --> 01:04:17,401
He's getting closer.

743
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:23,857
Lindi, I love you.

744
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,150
<i>Eddie...</i>

745
01:05:55,154 --> 01:05:56,154
<i>Here.</i>

746
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,920
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

747
01:06:02,094 --> 01:06:03,208
<i>You're gonna get outta here.</i>

748
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,443
<i>Eddie.</i>

749
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:41,276
Are you okay?

750
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:43,884
Yeah.

751
01:06:46,595 --> 01:06:48,502
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

752
01:06:49,807 --> 01:06:53,019
I want you to know that you'll
never, ever have to go through that again

753
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,926
Cause I can take care of us now.

754
01:06:56,132 --> 01:06:57,236
I'm sure you can.

755
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:00,348
I can make us safe.
I'm back! Okay

756
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:07,074
- Who's back? Eddie.
- Me.

757
01:07:07,476 --> 01:07:11,590
No! It's not you
You were different before.

758
01:07:11,892 --> 01:07:14,960
- I am still the same person.
- I wasn't when I was on it.

759
01:07:16,109 --> 01:07:18,135
I did things, I
would never do.

760
01:07:18,136 --> 01:07:19,747
Those things saved your life.

761
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:22,431
- But they weren't me.
- Yes. You know the way it works...

762
01:07:22,432 --> 01:07:24,138
I know how it works.

763
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:27,652
I get it, I totally get it. You feel invincible.

764
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:33,381
Where it will take us Lin, you can't even imagine
The things we'll be able to do

765
01:07:34,977 --> 01:07:39,084
Where we'll be a year from now
The kind of life that we'll finally be able to live

766
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,610
Well, you might have to live it without me.

767
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,800
Look! I am gonna stop taking it.

768
01:07:48,801 --> 01:07:52,168
There's just some things I have to do
to keep us safe and to, to set us up

769
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:54,955
And then, I'm gonna get off it... I mean,
that's the plan.

770
01:07:55,287 --> 01:07:59,154
Look! I have a plan. I swear
I'm gonna get off it.

771
01:08:01,072 --> 01:08:02,585
Okay

772
01:08:04,324 --> 01:08:06,399
I hope you do

773
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,785
Looking for me?

774
01:08:41,442 --> 01:08:45,447
Think you can run out on me? uh!
You think, I don't know where you are?

775
01:08:45,448 --> 01:08:47,375
I was under the impression,
our business was settled.

776
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:50,864
Well I want some more of that stuff,
or I shoot you right here.

777
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:51,853
Take your pick.

778
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:53,958
<i>This guy was not going away.</i>

779
01:08:54,481 --> 01:08:55,917
<i>A few pills would buy me some time</i>

780
01:08:55,993 --> 01:08:59,865
- Here it is. We're done.
- We will see.

781
01:09:00,065 --> 01:09:02,656
<i>Until I found a more...
permanent solution.</i>

782
01:09:02,691 --> 01:09:06,240
Unless you see a real threat,
I never want it known that I have any security.

783
01:09:06,241 --> 01:09:07,672
You'll never proceed me

784
01:09:07,673 --> 01:09:08,673
You'll always follow me.

785
01:09:08,674 --> 01:09:10,169
never more than 15 steps behind.

786
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,489
And never stand too close together.

787
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,553
I wanna be able to look behind me

788
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:15,214
if the opportunity presents itself.

789
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,599
And don't wear the same color suit.
This isn't the Matrix!

790
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,232
You have to know Eddie... I wrote you off.

791
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:28,645
- I was sick.
- You don't get sick

792
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,886
You're playing at this level -You get hit
by a car, you don't even die.

793
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:32,994
- You're absolutely right.
- I know I'm right.

794
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:35,727
I mean, I didn't know who
or what I was talking to.

795
01:09:35,728 --> 01:09:38,696
105. That's who you were talking to Carl.
Delirium.

796
01:09:38,731 --> 01:09:39,696
Hm hm.

797
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:44,742
- I sent over my revised projections.
- I didn't ask for your projections...

798
01:09:44,743 --> 01:09:47,273
I know, but I think
If you take a look at them...

799
01:09:47,274 --> 01:09:48,139
I already have.

800
01:09:48,174 --> 01:09:49,174
As a matter of fact...

801
01:09:51,144 --> 01:09:53,308
I fired a few people,
over your projections.

802
01:09:54,129 --> 01:09:56,040
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

803
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:58,225
You're relieved, that you know things,
my team missed.

804
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:02,324
The minute, the instant,
that's no longer true...

805
01:10:06,374 --> 01:10:08,305
<i>Two months after I'd started NZT...</i>

806
01:10:08,306 --> 01:10:10,771
<i>I was brokering the biggest
merger in corporate history.</i>

807
01:10:10,772 --> 01:10:15,624
Ironically, it's gonna be crude. Crude
is gonna be where we're gonna hit em.

808
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:17,638
Which yields a projected profit of 200%.

809
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,350
That makes both of us
very happy campers.

810
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:23,865
<i>I found that if I maintained an even dose,
remembered to eat</i>

811
01:10:23,866 --> 01:10:26,986
<i>drank no alcohol...
The blackouts didn't occur</i>

812
01:10:28,514 --> 01:10:31,215
Tom is it possible to construct
an imperceptible compartment?

813
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,728
- In this jacket?
- In all of them.

814
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,379
Certainly, sir.

815
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,795
<i>Safer though my stash now was,</i>

816
01:10:38,796 --> 01:10:40,754
<i>I was not sitting around until I ran out.</i>

817
01:10:40,755 --> 01:10:42,295
Well, can I combine these ingredients

818
01:10:42,296 --> 01:10:43,736
in the same exact quantity? Yes.

819
01:10:43,737 --> 01:10:46,313
but, the exact method of delivery to the brain,

820
01:10:46,314 --> 01:10:49,115
uhhh...
Dart to the dart board.

821
01:10:49,118 --> 01:10:51,592
- Meaning?
- clinical trials, guinea pig people.

822
01:10:51,593 --> 01:10:53,040
that's gonna take too long.

823
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:55,201
It is was it is. Or you'll kill people.

824
01:10:55,202 --> 01:10:58,174
Look. You need 12-18 months

825
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:00,019
I'll give you two million dollars
If you can do it in 6

826
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,662
I found that we could cart the cost, 30%.

827
01:11:11,293 --> 01:11:12,293
and uhm...

828
01:11:16,385 --> 01:11:17,488
Excuse me for one sec

829
01:11:21,003 --> 01:11:22,809
I thought we straightened this out, detective.

830
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:25,619
This isn't about Vernon again, Mr. Morra.

831
01:11:27,226 --> 01:11:28,429
What is this about?

832
01:11:29,624 --> 01:11:34,608
The witness identified the Maria Winberg suspect...
As this person.

833
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:42,158
Wanna tell me your whereabouts the night of April 2nd?

834
01:11:44,815 --> 01:11:46,058
<i>I couldn't keep this quite on my own</i>

835
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:52,147
<i>Enter Morris Brant, the most lethal lawyer
in New York.</i>

836
01:11:55,695 --> 01:11:57,239
You're lucky, somebody wiped the room.

837
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,702
It's weak circumstantial at best.

838
01:12:00,502 --> 01:12:04,074
- Just between us... Were you there?
- I don't remember.

839
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:07,177
I don't want to make concessions to you...

840
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:10,820
<i>Karl van Loon's and Hank Atwood,
had no idea</i>

841
01:12:10,821 --> 01:12:12,495
<i>I might soon be charged with murder.</i>

842
01:12:14,005 --> 01:12:16,413
But Ci-Corps, An-Dine and others,
are jockeying

843
01:12:16,615 --> 01:12:18,422
for the same industrial concessions in Libya

844
01:12:18,724 --> 01:12:20,831
that both our companies are pretending,
we're not sniffing out.

845
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:22,336
How do you know this?

846
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:25,147
The governmental bribes system is itself corrupt

847
01:12:25,448 --> 01:12:28,058
So of course, information about its inner-workings,
like anything, can be bought.

848
01:12:32,055 --> 01:12:32,374
Go on.

849
01:12:33,378 --> 01:12:36,188
If you take a look at the
lower left hand column in 2008,

850
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,497
five companies were jockeying for a position

851
01:12:38,797 --> 01:12:40,002
before we even took notice.

852
01:12:44,195 --> 01:12:45,246
Jesus, he looks frail.

853
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:48,674
- Could be an act.
- He's not even 60.

854
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,715
So have you decided Eddie,
whatta ya gonna do?

855
01:12:54,057 --> 01:12:56,753
When this is over?
I do not know.

856
01:12:57,067 --> 01:13:00,725
- You haven't given me the answer.
- You haven't you asked the question.

857
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:04,690
Well, Given the scale of my contribution...
let's say 45

858
01:13:04,799 --> 01:13:06,898
Humph! $45,000?

859
01:13:07,809 --> 01:13:09,811
40 million's plenty Eddie.

860
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:11,397
There's a lot more where that'll come from

861
01:13:11,524 --> 01:13:14,245
You know, Eddie...

862
01:13:14,246 --> 01:13:15,052
it may be on your mind,

863
01:13:15,052 --> 01:13:17,176
that you're not gonna continue
to work for me anymore...

864
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:19,370
This has been the learning
experience of my life.

865
01:13:19,371 --> 01:13:21,829
I hope has. I hope you don't think
you've gotten enough from me.

866
01:13:21,862 --> 01:13:23,167
on to the next...

867
01:13:23,469 --> 01:13:26,550
Well, in order for a career to evolve,
I'm gonna have to move on.

868
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:29,291
That you would even think that,
would only show me

869
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:31,298
how unprepared you are,
to be on your own.

870
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,904
I mean, you do know, you're a freak?

871
01:13:33,707 --> 01:13:35,892
Your deductive powers are a gift from God,

872
01:13:35,892 --> 01:13:37,689
or chance, or straight shot of sperm...

873
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:39,700
or whatever, or whoever the hell,
wrote your life script.

874
01:13:39,735 --> 01:13:41,135
A gift. not earned.

875
01:13:41,538 --> 01:13:44,547
You do not know what I know,
because you have not earned those powers.

876
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:46,858
You're careless with those powers.

877
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,271
You flaunt them and you throw them
around like a brat with his trust fund.

878
01:13:50,573 --> 01:13:53,390
You haven't had to climb up
all the greasy little rungs...

879
01:13:53,491 --> 01:13:55,155
You haven't been board-lined at the fundraisers...

880
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:58,700
you haven't done the time in that first marriage,
to the girl with the right father...

881
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:00,510
You think you can leap
over, all in a single bound.

882
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:04,525
You haven't had to bribe or charm or threaten
your way, to sit at this table.

883
01:14:04,827 --> 01:14:08,337
You don't know how to assess your competition,
because you haven't competed...

884
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:09,743
Don't make me your competition.

885
01:14:12,755 --> 01:14:16,568
Now I'll open up a line of credit for you.
You'll be wanting a few toys.

886
01:14:35,336 --> 01:14:37,144
<i>hotel rooms
were no longer an option.</i>

887
01:14:38,147 --> 01:14:39,453
<i>What I needed, was a bunker.</i>

888
01:14:39,454 --> 01:14:41,264
There's a built in safe...

889
01:14:41,465 --> 01:14:43,870
central surveillance, vault grade pneumatic doors.

890
01:14:44,074 --> 01:14:47,784
It's an unparalleled three tier security system.

891
01:14:48,387 --> 01:14:50,796
A fortress, with a hell of a view.

892
01:14:56,215 --> 01:14:58,528
- What is the asking price?
- 8.5

893
01:15:03,846 --> 01:15:04,250
I'll take it.

894
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,182
Right away, it was obvious, he was on NZT

895
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:16,593
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills.

896
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,801
Next week, you can go, fuck yourself.

897
01:15:18,836 --> 01:15:20,108
Not that you'll feel anything.

898
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:24,175
I don't think your fortune 500 financial friends,

899
01:15:24,179 --> 01:15:27,834
would appreciate the details,
of your little dilemma with the police.

900
01:15:29,343 --> 01:15:31,151
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here.

901
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,071
Getting smarter...

902
01:15:38,579 --> 01:15:40,284
<i>Obviously, this can not
go on</i>

903
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:41,192
<i>But there is very little on this earth</i>

904
01:15:41,394 --> 01:15:43,296
<i>that 40 million dollars can't solve</i>

905
01:15:43,299 --> 01:15:46,407
<i>and tomorrow at 9:00,
Atwood would sign the papers.</i>

906
01:15:54,537 --> 01:15:55,241
Do you wanna call it?

907
01:15:55,244 --> 01:15:59,455
- Cold feet?
- With all last night to tell us that.

908
01:16:01,965 --> 01:16:04,176
<i>- Anything?
- I'll call it again, sir.</i>

909
01:16:04,777 --> 01:16:06,486
Okay, the decision could've changed...

910
01:16:06,487 --> 01:16:08,487
That makes sense - but discourtesy doesn't.

911
01:16:09,588 --> 01:16:10,188
It's still on.

912
01:16:11,305 --> 01:16:13,911
Oh! Based on your charts and projections?

913
01:16:14,313 --> 01:16:16,220
You know, remind me... Who are you anyway?

914
01:16:17,123 --> 01:16:19,733
I'm sorry Karl, I've had it with this unqualified posturing little prick.

915
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:21,546
- Look...
- Since when is this the Delta quarrel?

916
01:16:21,547 --> 01:16:22,847
Don... Pull it back!

917
01:16:22,848 --> 01:16:27,563
Excuse me. Mr. Van Loon, Mrs. Atwood
is in your office.

918
01:16:29,475 --> 01:16:34,089
Ah. Mrs. Atwood, Karl van Loon,
My associate, Edward Morra.

919
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,090
Pleasure.

920
01:16:37,702 --> 01:16:41,014
- I wanted to make this as confidential as possible.
- Of course.

921
01:16:42,017 --> 01:16:45,832
My husband experienced some pain and
dizziness this morning.

922
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:48,444
He's currently at Lenox Hill - undergoing test.

923
01:16:48,447 --> 01:16:52,762
I just want you to know we have every
intention of signing the contract.

924
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:57,176
And as soon as he is able, we will proceed.

925
01:16:58,883 --> 01:17:01,493
I realize this is a useless platitude,
but if there's anything we can do...

926
01:17:01,528 --> 01:17:02,998
Please don't hesitate to tells us.

927
01:17:02,999 --> 01:17:06,412
Obviously, we want to be as helpful and as
practical as possible, Mrs. Atwood.

928
01:17:06,447 --> 01:17:08,720
Thank you, gentlemen.
I rely on your discretion.

929
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:12,436
There wont be a proxy.

930
01:17:12,536 --> 01:17:15,045
a crazy prick like him giving away power of attorney?

931
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:21,571
Well, better get better.

932
01:17:25,383 --> 01:17:28,996
<i>But Atwood wouldn't get better
because Atwood was out of NZT.</i>

933
01:17:33,421 --> 01:17:36,226
Well, why are we surprised?

934
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:39,840
<i>How many other meteoric rises
might be explained by NZT?</i>

935
01:17:40,241 --> 01:17:41,252
<i>At least I had some.</i>

936
01:17:42,152 --> 01:17:43,056
<i>My life wasn't in jeopardy</i>

937
01:17:43,323 --> 01:17:43,354
You wait here.

938
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:46,864
<i>only my money. and my liberty</i>

939
01:17:48,271 --> 01:17:49,476
I've been all over them.

940
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:53,589
We can't allow any disparity
in race or physical type

941
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:55,496
between you and the rest of the line-up.

942
01:17:55,498 --> 01:17:58,710
they're as close to your clones, as I could possibly get.

943
01:17:58,711 --> 01:18:02,524
It's gotta be, just one big handsome blur to this guy.

944
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:17,784
<i>Who was out there?</i>

945
01:18:20,292 --> 01:18:21,098
<i>the woman's husband?</i>

946
01:18:23,003 --> 01:18:23,708
<i>the hotel maid?</i>

947
01:18:26,917 --> 01:18:28,423
<i>Was this how, it was all going to end?</i>

948
01:18:32,645 --> 01:18:34,752
Not the dimmest clue.

949
01:18:35,154 --> 01:18:38,565
- He was dithering
"He was the third from the right. No not him. "

950
01:18:39,472 --> 01:18:43,281
Here you go. A thing of beauty.
You had that made?

951
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:44,889
I did.

952
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:06,355
<i>This today... The Dow has been YO-YO-ing</i>

953
01:19:06,355 --> 01:19:08,880
<i>amid speculation, that Van-Loon Associates,</i>

954
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,175
<i>and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...</i>

955
01:19:13,693 --> 01:19:14,999
Have you been talking to anyone?

956
01:19:16,906 --> 01:19:19,017
NO. I haven't been talking to anybody, Karl.
I'm not stupid!

957
01:19:19,117 --> 01:19:20,624
I know you're not stupid Eddie,

958
01:19:20,624 --> 01:19:22,870
but don't make the classic
smart person's mistake...

959
01:19:23,029 --> 01:19:24,435
thinking no-one's
smarter than you.

960
01:19:24,437 --> 01:19:25,870
Where the hell have you been?

961
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:28,146
This is the second time
you've turned to vapor.

962
01:19:28,147 --> 01:19:29,658
I was in the building.
I was getting coffee?

963
01:19:29,659 --> 01:19:30,659
Why? Has there been movement?

964
01:19:30,759 --> 01:19:32,968
Yeah! There's been movement alright.
Atwood's in a coma.

965
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,975
He wasn't playing us, he's dying.

966
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:37,184
What do you know about this?

967
01:19:38,688 --> 01:19:40,695
<i>I was less than usually equipped to answer.</i>

968
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:42,571
<i>The dullness was coming on.</i>

969
01:19:42,572 --> 01:19:45,030
I was overdue to take
my NZT.

970
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:48,292
And the pain was starting behind my eyes.

971
01:19:49,029 --> 01:19:49,832
Excuse me.

972
01:19:50,834 --> 01:19:51,438
You're not excused.

973
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,747
What, a man in your employ, can't take a piss, Karl?

974
01:20:17,032 --> 01:20:18,934
<i>Was it Brant, or someone else?</i>

975
01:20:18,935 --> 01:20:20,845
<i>The police station? The coat room?</i>

976
01:20:35,704 --> 01:20:36,211
Mr. Morra...

977
01:20:37,613 --> 01:20:37,721
Mr. Morra.

978
01:20:38,522 --> 01:20:38,722
Mr. Morra!

979
01:20:39,623 --> 01:20:40,623
This just came for you.

980
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:52,266
Alright, I'm gonna ask you again Eddie...
What do you know about this?

981
01:20:53,069 --> 01:20:55,478
- What? About the leak?
- No... About Atwood.

982
01:20:56,181 --> 01:20:57,285
What? What about Atwood?

983
01:20:57,387 --> 01:20:59,080
Look...You got a long way to go

984
01:20:59,081 --> 01:21:00,870
-as a liar kiddo...
-Heck Karl, I don't know what your..

985
01:21:00,871 --> 01:21:02,719
Listen, what you about to say is bullshit!

986
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,285
I know there's something you're
hiding from me. I smell it on you!

987
01:21:05,718 --> 01:21:08,627
Right now,I wanna know why
this deal is dead in the water!

988
01:21:09,641 --> 01:21:10,444
Karl.

989
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:13,562
Hey!

990
01:21:13,563 --> 01:21:14,100
Eddie!

991
01:21:31,215 --> 01:21:32,647
<i>Outside Lennox Hill Hospital today,</i>

992
01:21:32,648 --> 01:21:35,426
<i>more twists and turns
in the Van Loon - Atwood merger.</i>

993
01:21:35,727 --> 01:21:36,397
<i>There is absolutely.</i>

994
01:21:36,432 --> 01:21:38,953
<i>no truth to the rumor of this merger.</i>

995
01:21:39,653 --> 01:21:40,853
<i>None whatsoever!</i>

996
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,665
<i>My husband is having tests...
it's a difficult time</i>

997
01:21:45,768 --> 01:21:48,480
<i>We would appreciate you direct,
your further questions to our attorney.</i>

998
01:21:49,784 --> 01:21:51,893
<i>Ah, Yes...We have no
further comments at this time...</i>

999
01:21:52,093 --> 01:21:53,230
<i>we're just awaiting the results</i>

1000
01:21:53,231 --> 01:21:55,685
<i>from the latest round of test, and hoping the best.</i>

1001
01:21:56,108 --> 01:21:56,808
<i>Thank you!</i>

1002
01:22:35,861 --> 01:22:36,475
Eddie...

1003
01:22:38,076 --> 01:22:39,976
I know you're in there Eddie

1004
01:22:41,888 --> 01:22:44,392
Eddie, come out.

1005
01:22:46,803 --> 01:22:48,009
Come on!

1006
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:51,724
Open the door.

1007
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:11,498
<i>And so, here I am.</i>

1008
01:23:14,911 --> 01:23:17,421
<i>I knew that they will kill me
slowly and horribly.</i>

1009
01:23:17,922 --> 01:23:19,729
<i>But this choice would at least be mine</i>

1010
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:31,877
<i>But we're instinctive creatures...</i>

1011
01:23:32,678 --> 01:23:33,383
<i>We wanna live.</i>

1012
01:23:34,887 --> 01:23:37,095
<i>so my foggy brain tried to remember</i>

1013
01:23:37,197 --> 01:23:39,105
<i>where one tablet of NZT might be</i>

1014
01:23:46,432 --> 01:23:47,936
<i>it was possible.</i>

1015
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,045
<i>and possible was enough.</i>

1016
01:24:15,037 --> 01:24:15,941
Hey, Eddie.

1017
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:41,939
You know, I want more,
so why would you upset me?

1018
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:45,554
I don't like being down to this last one

1019
01:24:46,257 --> 01:24:47,863
You do not even know how to use it.

1020
01:24:48,464 --> 01:24:49,764
You don't appreciate it.

1021
01:24:50,864 --> 01:24:53,069
You see, I dissolve it in solution.

1022
01:24:53,674 --> 01:24:54,580
you shoot it.

1023
01:24:55,485 --> 01:24:57,500
It goes straight into the blood and brain.

1024
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,913
lasts much longer.

1025
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:20,185
So... You tell me
where the rest is?

1026
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,403
I'm plum out..

1027
01:25:27,913 --> 01:25:29,920
You know, these guys are gonna find it...

1028
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:33,233
Or I gonna make you tell me

1029
01:25:34,537 --> 01:25:36,845
Question is...
Which is gonna come first?

1030
01:25:38,152 --> 01:25:39,657
I guess, we gonna find out uh?.

1031
01:25:44,174 --> 01:25:45,780
This is a waste of my time, you know.

1032
01:25:47,481 --> 01:25:49,189
I'm getting out of this side of the business.

1033
01:25:49,907 --> 01:25:52,317
I'm branching out...

1034
01:25:52,918 --> 01:25:55,218
I'm starting import export company.

1035
01:25:55,819 --> 01:25:57,226
very exiting stuff.

1036
01:25:57,928 --> 01:26:00,336
I got a lot on my plate,
you're lucky I am here.

1037
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:13,786
Back in the old times.
I might peel your skin back, flay you.

1038
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:18,405
Flay. That's a nice word,
I didn't know this before.

1039
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:21,816
I had such a poor vocabulary.

1040
01:26:26,838 --> 01:26:28,947
But then I discovered this thing... Google.

1041
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:33,264
Did you know the small and large intestines is 20 foot long?

1042
01:26:33,299 --> 01:26:35,077
I had no idea, I don't believe it.

1043
01:26:35,378 --> 01:26:37,586
I gotta see this for myself. I'm dubious.

1044
01:26:37,987 --> 01:26:39,087
That's another nice word.

1045
01:26:40,089 --> 01:26:43,002
Anyway... I am sure you're curious too.

1046
01:26:43,904 --> 01:26:45,712
But don't worry.
Everything's sterilized.

1047
01:26:46,213 --> 01:26:47,921
We're gonna keep you alive
through the whole shebang.

1048
01:26:49,425 --> 01:26:51,631
You're gonna get a front row seat, baby!

1049
01:27:30,264 --> 01:27:31,922
<i>not much of a triumph, was it?</i>

1050
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:33,581
<i>because I would die here too.</i>

1051
01:27:36,689 --> 01:27:37,796
<i>only NZT could help me</i>

1052
01:27:37,896 --> 01:27:40,006
<i>and the last of it, was in
this pug's bloodstream.</i>

1053
01:28:56,854 --> 01:28:57,458
Victor!

1054
01:29:05,687 --> 01:29:05,993
What?

1055
01:30:16,557 --> 01:30:17,061
Victor.

1056
01:30:20,762 --> 01:30:21,062
Victor?

1057
01:30:23,363 --> 01:30:23,863
Victor!

1058
01:31:14,162 --> 01:31:15,284
<i>The police would later note, </i>

1059
01:31:15,285 --> 01:31:18,261
<i>that my apartments previous
owner was an arms dealer.</i>

1060
01:31:18,522 --> 01:31:21,131
<i>of course these intruders,
had been his dissatisfied clients</i>

1061
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:24,745
<i>and the night was still young</i>

1062
01:31:38,297 --> 01:31:40,404
Well, I'm sure you're curious to know
what happened to your boss.

1063
01:31:40,604 --> 01:31:41,608
I certainly am.

1064
01:31:42,512 --> 01:31:45,873
I mean, if my attorney was really
working for Mr. Atwood,

1065
01:31:45,874 --> 01:31:46,874
trying to save his life...

1066
01:31:47,432 --> 01:31:48,635
Why is he dead?

1067
01:31:49,841 --> 01:31:52,217
I mean, at what point was the pony express,

1068
01:31:52,218 --> 01:31:54,601
supposed to ride in
with his life saving medication?

1069
01:31:55,763 --> 01:31:57,068
<i>his boss was dead.</i>

1070
01:31:57,669 --> 01:32:00,180
<i>So, I didn't matter now.</i>

1071
01:32:02,087 --> 01:32:05,901
<i>But he did not appreciate that
Morris Brant had kept the pills for himself.</i>

1072
01:32:18,851 --> 01:32:20,356
<i>and it was all still possible</i>

1073
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:26,580
after 12 months

1074
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:41,236
Actually, now there's no more tickets.

1075
01:32:42,241 --> 01:32:43,145
Yeah, I got it.

1076
01:32:43,546 --> 01:32:45,854
An overbooked fund-raiser; that's a first!

1077
01:32:46,758 --> 01:32:48,364
Well, here he comes. I'll ask him.

1078
01:32:49,267 --> 01:32:51,275
Ah! That's much better.
Great job!

1079
01:32:54,487 --> 01:32:55,289
Edward...

1080
01:32:57,699 --> 01:33:00,309
I think we looking at a second overflow of bent.

1081
01:33:00,609 --> 01:33:01,948
There's a league of donations coming in,

1082
01:33:01,949 --> 01:33:04,377
and I don't think they're even
gonna try a second debate.

1083
01:33:04,423 --> 01:33:05,026
Great.

1084
01:33:05,326 --> 01:33:07,536
Hold on. There's guy from Ivan Chemcorp's
in your office.

1085
01:33:07,736 --> 01:33:08,538
I've a lunch.

1086
01:33:08,842 --> 01:33:10,648
Look...The biggest contributor,
give him his two crappy little minutes?

1087
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:12,756
- Ivan Chemcorp pharmaceuticals?
- Yeah.

1088
01:33:15,064 --> 01:33:17,272
Finally get to meet the guys that keeps the lights on.

1089
01:33:19,282 --> 01:33:20,887
- Karl?
- Mr. Morra.

1090
01:33:22,393 --> 01:33:23,497
what a surprise!

1091
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,706
They told me somebody from Ivan was coming across...

1092
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:28,917
Yes, thats me now.
I am moving out of the energy business.

1093
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,724
Come on!

1094
01:33:31,025 --> 01:33:33,234
That's like Hefner moving out of the mansion.

1095
01:33:33,535 --> 01:33:36,145
I bought Ivan several months ago.
I'm surprised you didn't hear.

1096
01:33:36,747 --> 01:33:40,460
No. No. Well, I know they keep me hoppin' here.

1097
01:33:40,863 --> 01:33:43,272
Well, it's gonna pay off
Senator Morra.

1098
01:33:44,979 --> 01:33:47,329
The Senate, well who knows?

1099
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,336
Everything's a technicality
from here on. Isn't it, Eddie?

1100
01:33:51,502 --> 01:33:55,519
I think we both know where it's headed, if
you can, maintain.

1101
01:33:58,832 --> 01:34:00,939
Have you asked yourself,
what you're gonna do, when you run out?

1102
01:34:17,904 --> 01:34:20,312
- When did you know?
- Does it matter? I know now.

1103
01:34:21,818 --> 01:34:23,324
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie.

1104
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:25,130
I could have bought Ivan at 33 a share.

1105
01:34:25,432 --> 01:34:26,435
We could have been partners.

1106
01:34:30,653 --> 01:34:32,358
So Ivan makes NZT.

1107
01:34:32,759 --> 01:34:35,370
We it'll never officially exist.

1108
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:37,878
Obviously, I don't need to point out
the advantages for you..

1109
01:34:38,681 --> 01:34:39,986
Oh I think maybe you do.

1110
01:34:40,889 --> 01:34:44,202
Limitless supply.
We know you can't get anymore.

1111
01:34:44,805 --> 01:34:45,909
You sure about that?

1112
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:47,616
I shut down your lab this
morning.

1113
01:34:50,527 --> 01:34:53,038
Eddie, I just wanna help you. That's all.

1114
01:34:54,142 --> 01:34:57,038
Keep your supply.
No disruption in service.

1115
01:34:57,039 --> 01:34:58,701
Give you piece of mind. That's all.

1116
01:35:00,966 --> 01:35:03,476
And in return... I do what?

1117
01:35:03,979 --> 01:35:07,692
Give a little advice maybe.
I won't be bothering much at first.

1118
01:35:08,093 --> 01:35:10,303
And later...What
are gonna be bothering me with?

1119
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:11,970
Well, given where you're heading...

1120
01:35:11,971 --> 01:35:14,183
Some of our ideas are a bit ambitious.

1121
01:35:14,184 --> 01:35:16,037
But hey! I think they're achievable.

1122
01:35:16,425 --> 01:35:17,830
And what if I don't like your ideas?

1123
01:35:17,836 --> 01:35:19,863
Well then we'll say..."God-speed."

1124
01:35:20,441 --> 01:35:23,654
and your candle will have shed
a brief but lovely light.

1125
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:28,271
But you know what Eddie,
let's not even go there right now.

1126
01:35:28,571 --> 01:35:33,189
Right now, I just want to keep you
brilliant and healthy.

1127
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:34,897
Let's go get some lunch.

1128
01:35:54,069 --> 01:35:55,174
After you, Senator.

1129
01:35:57,382 --> 01:35:58,486
Thanks for stopping by, Karl.

1130
01:36:00,493 --> 01:36:01,296
Give us a second.

1131
01:36:02,199 --> 01:36:03,003
What are you doing?

1132
01:36:03,304 --> 01:36:04,810
You want to be president of the
United States...

1133
01:36:05,012 --> 01:36:06,616
or brain dead - stuck full of tubes?

1134
01:36:06,918 --> 01:36:07,722
I'll take my chances.

1135
01:36:08,022 --> 01:36:10,429
I told you...Your chances don't exist.
We shut down your lab.

1136
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:11,935
You don't you think some
smart-ass and NZT

1137
01:36:12,237 --> 01:36:13,617
might have two or three, or even four labs?

1138
01:36:13,618 --> 01:36:15,069
So what. You're not making anymore.

1139
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:16,789
That's right. I'm not. I thought better of it.

1140
01:36:16,836 --> 01:36:19,346
See once you know what's in
it, you can tweak, re-engineer...

1141
01:36:19,347 --> 01:36:21,433
get the bugs out.
Taper off

1142
01:36:22,478 --> 01:36:23,617
I'm off it, Karl.

1143
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:27,297
Well on it, or off it, there's no
scenario where you are not working for me.

1144
01:36:27,598 --> 01:36:29,146
How you gonna pay me? In cigarettes?

1145
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:32,084
- Last year you traded insider information 17 times.
- You threating me?

1146
01:36:32,085 --> 01:36:35,376
Like checks from Dubai, dumping
in Chile, disappeared officials

1147
01:36:35,377 --> 01:36:36,316
When you said the spot...

1148
01:36:36,317 --> 01:36:37,610
You wanna go to war with me?

1149
01:36:37,611 --> 01:36:39,718
And trust me when I say this
I am not even being creative.

1150
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:41,770
There's no way you can be making
accusations like that

1151
01:36:41,772 --> 01:36:42,772
and be walking around alive.

1152
01:36:43,831 --> 01:36:45,114
That you wouldn't even think that

1153
01:36:45,115 --> 01:36:46,639
shows me how unprepared
your are to fight me.

1154
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,082
- You're not longer equipped to fight me.
- Do you think I didn't learn anything...

1155
01:36:50,282 --> 01:36:52,228
that my synapses didn't change, that I kept absolutely nothing?

1156
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:55,904
- You have no idea, what kind of enemy I can be...
- That van's gonna rear-end that taxi.

1157
01:36:56,454 --> 01:36:57,079
What?

1158
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:00,220
The driver's distracted; he's
texting; he's going 30mph...

1159
01:37:00,421 --> 01:37:02,299
He needs 60 feet stop; he doesn't have room to work with.

1160
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:07,887
I see everything, Karl.

1161
01:37:07,923 --> 01:37:10,129
I'm 50 moves ahead of you
and everybody else.

1162
01:37:10,338 --> 01:37:12,527
What makes you think I don't know the guy
with a beat on you right now?

1163
01:37:12,841 --> 01:37:14,948
How do you know you're gonna be
alive this time next year?

1164
01:37:14,949 --> 01:37:17,787
What are you doing?

1165
01:37:18,591 --> 01:37:19,727
Somethin's pumpin' at half-mast in there.

1166
01:37:19,728 --> 01:37:21,085
Walls of your heart are dilated.

1167
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:24,010
Aorta's not standing up.
Soon you need to get that replaced.

1168
01:37:25,492 --> 01:37:27,424
But you already knew that.

1169
01:37:33,121 --> 01:37:35,743
You know, you should
really be glad about this.

1170
01:37:35,779 --> 01:37:38,366
Cause me working for you,
you'd end up as my bitch.

1171
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:53,223
Maybe we should cool off and talk again

1172
01:37:54,809 --> 01:37:56,335
I don't think so.

1173
01:37:58,221 --> 01:37:59,647
Don't forget to vote.

1174
01:38:07,959 --> 01:38:13,700
- Edward, you good?
- Yeah! Told you I have a lunch.

1175
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:22,433
- I am sorry.
- Hey, don't worry.

1176
01:38:23,798 --> 01:38:27,251
- How's your day going?
- I've had better.

1177
01:38:28,832 --> 01:38:30,829
I still can't deal with that haircut.

1178
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:32,631
I don't even recognize
you on the street.

1179
01:38:32,632 --> 01:38:34,781
Well I'm a new man.

1180
01:38:35,857 --> 01:38:37,593
I've already ordered.

1181
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:53,954
What?

1182
01:38:54,454 --> 01:39:34,454
Resync Perfectly By
LuRaZo +_=
