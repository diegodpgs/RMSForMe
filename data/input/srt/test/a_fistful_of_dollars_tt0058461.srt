You killed all four of them.

You'll be strung up.

165

Don't fire a shot.

166
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:05,967
I'm John Baxter, sheriff.

167
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:12,390
Yeah? Well, if you're the sheriff, you
better get these men underground.

168
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,239

(EXCLAIMS)

170
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,342
I told you I wasn't cheap,

171
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,803
but I think you'll find
it's worth your while.

172
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:53,598

when you're all done.

When do I start?

175
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:02,523
I'm not in a hurry,
at least for the moment.

176
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:04,275
I'd say with
four less Baxters,

177
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,861
right now is as good a
time to start as any.

178
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:11,032
In a few days I hear there will be a troop
of cavalry passing through San Miguel.

179
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:15,494
I wouldn't want the military sticking
their long noses into our business.

180
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,664
You seem to be
well-informed.

181
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:25,463
In these parts, a man's life often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

182
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:29,717
This thing couldn't have been
very useful to its owner.

183
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:36,390
My brother Ramon did that.
He often uses it for target practice.

184
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:40,519
With a gun in his hand,
no one stands in his way.

185
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:43,147
The suit of armor is
one of his favorite targets,

186
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:46,984
naturally, when he does not
have anything better to shoot.

187
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:51,322
Well, I'll be kind of curious
to meet this brother of yours.

Ah.

of the most trusted of my men.

190

Follow him.
He will bring you to your room.

191
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,542
I would like you
to feel at home.

192
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:06,879
Well, I never found home
that great, but let's go.

Her name's Marisol.
You just forget about her.

00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:36,450
This one will be your room.

00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:09,150
ESTEBAN:
You gave him $100.

198
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,192
DON MIGUEL: Yes.

199
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:12,361
We never pay that much.

200
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:14,655
Can you explain to me
why you have taken him on?

201
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:18,242
To have that filthy gringo around the
house and to give him $100 besides?

202
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:21,454
We have never paid
anybody so much.

203
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,165
You cannot leave someone like that
to do what he wants around here.

204
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:28,878
He's capable of doing anything.
And I want law and order in this place.

205
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:33,549
If that is all you want,
there is a much cheaper way.

206
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,801
Just snuff him out.

207
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,889
And who will be
the one? You?

208
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,974
Yes, why not?

209
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:43,184
A shot in his back,

210
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:46,437
and then you would have him out
of the way in no time at all.

211
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:51,525
Listen, I could do it
easily right now.

212
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:56,280
He won't be expecting it,
and I'd get back the 100.

213
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,287
You're stupid, Esteban!
Even if you are my brother!

214
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:06,707
A bullet in the back, eh?
And it is ended!

215
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,377
And what happens if your hand
should tremble slightly?

216
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,212
And he's only been hurt?

217
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:16,008
And with the cavalry arriving in town
and that Yankee so quick on the draw.

218
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:17,093
I was
only thinking...

219
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:18,803
You mustn't
think of anything!

220

You let me
do the thinking instead.

221
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:25,810
Go and see the americano.
Just ask him if he needs anything and make friends.

222
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:29,480
Get one thing clear
in that head of yours.

223
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,942
This is going to be a quiet
town until Ramon gets back!

224

226
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:00,886
What are you doing?

227
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:04,014
Moving.

228
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,767
But didn't you know all our
men live here with us?

229
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:14,525
That's all very cozy, but I don't
find you men all that appealing.

230
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:19,071
Besides, your brother said he didn't
have any need for me any more right now.

231
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,472
Halt!

00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:48,309
<i>Sergeant?
Yes, Capitan?</i>

233
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:52,313
Tell the men we'll be spending
tonight here in this place.

234
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,482
Arrange it so they can
pick up the supplies here.

235
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:57,067
Also, double the guard in order
to watch the stagecoach there.

236
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,819
Yes, sir.

237
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,239
Now what do you suppose they're
carrying in that coach?

238
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:04,158
It'd be easy
to find out.

239
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,702
Get up close to it and take a
little look at what's in it.

240
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,413
If they fire at you,
you know it's gold.

241
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,332
Not a bad idea.

242
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:26,555
Mmm.

243
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,902

Hello.

245
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,114

Why aren't you sleeping?

248

When I see you staring
like that, it bothers me.

249
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:08,430
I still keep wondering
what was in that stagecoach.

250
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:11,642
It's something they seem to
think is very important.

251
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:16,105
I asked a few questions of the
captain and almost was arrested.

252
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,983
Who's Marisol?

253
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:23,445
You better get some sleep.
You need it.

254
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,990
It's much too dangerous,
even for you.

255
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,327
All I did is ask
who she was.

256
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:33,330
She is a woman.

257
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:35,833
And Ramon's madly
in love with her.

258
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,960
Does that make it
clear to you?

259
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,757
Everybody in this town
talks about Ramon.

260
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,968
Kind of curious
to meet him.

261
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,598
If you are smart, you will try to stay
clear of Ramon as long as possible

262
00:23:57,146 --> 00:24:01,191
SILVANITO: There are the soldiers.
They are moving on very quietly.

264
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,534
They're headed
for the frontier.

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,248
Tell me,

266
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,794
is that the way
you go to bed every night?

267
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,923
Don't worry.
I didn't dirty the sheets.

268
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,677
No, wait.
I'm coming, too.

269
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:32,264
I want to see for myself how you're
going to get yourself in trouble.

Go ahead.

There is your gold
as promised.

00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:35,411
I hope the guns you will be giving us
will be equally useful to our army.

275
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:38,872
Rest assured, Captain.
We'll check them over together.

I mentioned him.

It was terribly hot
on the road during the day.

that it's very stupid,

to just keep on shooting at each
other and without any results.

00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,570
I think that Ramon
has the right idea.

317
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:42,532
I, too, am getting tired of these killings.
They must stop.

318
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:46,745
This is all
very, very touching.

319
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,289
You mean you don't admire peace?

320
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:53,126
It's not real easy to like
something you know nothing about.

321
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:57,255
Stay in San Miguel and you may
just profit from the experience.

322
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:00,509
No, thanks.
I'll be moving on.

323
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,351
Here's your money,
Don Miguel.

324
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,687
I only used
a small amount of it.

325
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,649
I don't like to take money
unless I feel I've earned it.

326
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:20,320
Now, why are you so hasty?
You should stay here.

327
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:23,031
You might enjoy
dining with us tonight.

328
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:26,910
You see, the Baxters have four men
in the cemetery on account of me.

329
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:30,163
I don't think they'd
appreciate my presence.

330
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:41,133
I don't like that americano.
He's too smart to be just a hired fighter.

331
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,843
At shooting a pistol
no one can touch him.

332
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:43,927
I can see that.

333
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:47,931
When someone with that face works with
his gun, you may count on two things.

334
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:50,934
He's fast on the trigger,
but he's also intelligent.

335
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:53,687
That makes him too dangerous
for you, I think, my brothers.

336
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,565
And now that he's gone, will you please
explain to me that silly nonsense

337
00:30:56,648 --> 00:31:00,027
about hanging up your gun and
making up with the Baxters?

338
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,987
Is it possible,
old fellow,

339
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,866
that you'll never be able to reach
any conclusions on your own?

340
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:09,286
Don't you think our government and the
americanos will find those bodies,

341
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,371
and then start
an invesfigafion?

342
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,040
They'll investigate,
all right,

343
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:16,793
and we'll be quiet and
peacefully abide our time.

344
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:21,048
We know nothing about the
massacre at the Rio Bravo, eh?

345
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,383
I arranged for the bodies
to be lying,

346
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,261
as if both companies
killed each other.

347
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:29,347
But do you think
they'll believe it?

348
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:31,933
Yes, I think so.

349
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,102
Because if they don't
find some guilty party,

350
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:37,522
it would be a pretty good reason
to call off the investigation.

351
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:40,317
Yes, but what
about the Baxters?

352
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,736
The Baxters?

353
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:46,156
They want nothing more
than to live in peace.

354
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,658
We'll let them have
their own way for a while.

355
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,077
So forget
about the Baxters.

356
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,164
We'll take care of them later
when the investigation finishes.

357
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,208
(LAUGHING)

358
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:03,381
That was a fine idea
that you had.

359
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:05,383
What was it again?

360
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,219
Ah, yes, yes, Yes-

361
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:12,766
The Baxters on one side.
The Rojos on the other.

362
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,812
And you'd be
in the middle.

363
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:20,232
The only problem is that
they've joined up.

364
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,738
Now you are without a job, and you don't
have money to pay me what you owe me.

365
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:30,283
There is only one thing for you to do.
Leave here immediately.

366
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,410
I will forget about
what you owe me.

367
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:36,289
And you leave San Miguel and never
come back for the rest of your days.

368
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:40,293
Joe, I have prepared the wagon
the way you asked me to.

369
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:43,922
It's sitting out in the back
here with two empty coffins.

370
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,715
What are you up to?

371
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,093
Are you changing
your profession?

372
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,554
If you want to go on
living, you'd better.

373
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:54,641
In my opinion, you'll
make a fine pallbearer.

374
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,436
Close this place
and come with me, huh?

375
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,816
Oh, close up? It's done.
Where are we going?

376
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:06,403
I'd like to know where we are
going, or is it a secret?

377
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,283
Down by the river.
Have a look at some corpses down there.

378
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,996
The Rojos say, "Come to
dinner," and we must go.

379
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,624
But l don't
like it at all,

380
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:04,044
even if they've granted all the
guarantees we've demanded.

381
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:09,382
We'll go along with it,
but don't touch anything.

382
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:12,219
You mustn't eat.
You mustn't drink.

383
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:17,307
You just keep your eyes open
and keep your wits about you.

(EXCLAIMS)

385
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,585
Are you sure that
nobody has seen us?

386
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:47,754
Only a ghost or two.

387
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,590
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't joke about things like this.

388
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:53,510

where they are.

(SILVANITO LAUGHS)

You look as though this
place suits you very well.

391
00:34:57,514 --> 00:35:00,725
And if you go on like this, you
will soon be here permanently.

(SILVANITO LAUGHS)

393
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:14,781
I do not understand.

394
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:18,952
Why is it with all those bodies down by
the river we are just burying these two?

395
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:21,329
We're not.
We're not gonna bury them.

396
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,623
What do you mean
we're not burying them?

397
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,418
That's right.
We're not gonna bury them.

398
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,045
If we are not going to
bury them,

399
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:32,215
I would like to know
what we will use them for?

400
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:35,385
Why are we taking
the trouble to do this?

401
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,471
The dead can be
very useful sometimes.

402
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:45,186
They've helped me out of
tough spots more than once.

403
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,486
First, they don't talk.

404
00:35:55,238 --> 00:35:58,908
Second, they can be made to look
alive if I manage it right.

405
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:02,829
And, third...

406
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:06,791
Well, third, if you shoot
them, there's no worry,

407
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,877
'cause they're dead already.

408
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,253
Understand?

409
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:13,590
It doesn't make a bit of sense
to me, and I'm getting out.

410
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,800
I'm alive, and I want to remain
with the living, understand?

411
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,761
And when I'm dead, I'll want
to remain with the dead.

412
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:20,555
I would be unhappy if somebody living
forces me to remain with the living.

413
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:22,766
I hope that's clear.

414
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:27,228
And, also, I don't like the idea that
you've placed those bodies there!

415
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:28,521
The man we buried
in that grave

416
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:31,691
is the only one who ever died of
pneumonia in this cursed town!

417
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,360
Take it easy now,
will you?

418
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:37,197
These two friends of ours here
are gonna help me pay your bill.

419
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,532
Get up there!

420
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,562
The only reason they could
have to start a war with us,

421
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,732
would be to kidnap you
from your husband's side.

422
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,902
He's gallant, this Rojo.

423
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:18,905
I really didn't think him
capable of compliments.

424
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:23,743
And he's not. All that he says
is false, like his proposals.

425
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:28,289
You women. If things aren't complicated
for you, you become suspicious.

426
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:32,710
Yes, because to me, it
just didn't seem right.

427
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:36,172
It went too smoothly.
I don't trust them.

428
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:38,842
You'd like to prove me
wrong, wouldn't you?

429
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:40,844
Always the same thing.

430
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,473
Good night.

431
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:26,598
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

432
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:31,227
I just want you to know why the Rojos
want to make peace all of a sudden.

433
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,314
You see, there was once
a wagon load of gold

434
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:36,900
that the soldiers were
taking to the border.

come up here quickly.

you're never sure
how he's gonna react.

438
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:05,553
Give him $500.

439
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:06,679
How's that?

440
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:09,182
Give the money to him.

441
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:12,185
He has an interesting story.
Listen to him.

442
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:15,188
That's the right idea?
You didn't misunderstand?

443
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:17,190
I get the wrong idea
only when it suits me.

ESTEBAN: Ramon.
RAMON: What is it?

445
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,360
The soldiers, the ones who
were escorting the gold...

446
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:23,196
Two of those soldiers got away.
They are hiding out in the cemetery.

447
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:26,366

They're about to capture them.

You are well-informed, eh?

451
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:39,379
A man's life in these parts often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

own words.

453

Tell me. Why are you
doing this for us?

454

$500.

455

With these two soldiers
as witnesses against Ramon,

456
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:03,570
the government will be able to rid the
town of the Rojos and their whole band.

Then San Miguel
will have just one boss.

784
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:31,308
You're liable to
have some business.

785
01:28:31,391 --> 01:28:32,809
Very good!

786
01:28:32,893 --> 01:28:34,811
That's what
I wanted to hear.

787
01:28:34,895 --> 01:28:38,148
And I have a little surprise
for you that I brought along.

788
01:28:38,231 --> 01:28:39,900
I know how much you
are going to need it.

789
01:28:39,983 --> 01:28:41,818
It was very hard
to get my hands on it.

790
01:28:41,902 --> 01:28:46,406
But I got it by first using my head.
No one can resist two barrels of wine.

791
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:49,075
Isn't that right?
Then I thought that,

792
01:28:49,159 --> 01:28:52,996
well, you might need that pistol,
and I brought another present.

793
01:28:54,664 --> 01:28:58,585
It's dynamite.
I stole it from the Rojos.

794
01:28:59,085 --> 01:29:00,295
And now it seems to me

795
01:29:00,378 --> 01:29:03,256
the moment's come for
you to light the fuse

796
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:05,342
and send it
back to them.

797

799
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,655
Still lots of light.

800
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,078
Too early
to be asleep, yet.

801

(MEN LAUGHING)

802
01:29:36,957 --> 01:29:38,542
Rubio, here.

803
01:29:41,836 --> 01:29:43,129
(GROANING)

804
01:29:44,089 --> 01:29:48,426
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle.
I could never find another like this.

805
01:29:49,928 --> 01:29:52,264
Listen, Ramon, let's try
it with this one now.

806
01:29:54,849 --> 01:29:56,434
(DYNAMITE EXPLODING)

807
01:31:57,889 --> 01:31:59,099
Gringo!

808
01:32:06,356 --> 01:32:08,775
Heard you wanted
to see me.

809
01:32:09,651 --> 01:32:11,986
<i>The americano's</i> dead.

810
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:15,240
Let the old man down.

811
01:32:33,299 --> 01:32:35,719
What's wrong, Ramon?

812
01:32:36,302 --> 01:32:38,263
You losing your touch?

813
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:47,897
Are you afraid, Ramon?

814
01:32:47,981 --> 01:32:49,274
(GIGGLES)

815
01:32:51,693 --> 01:32:55,071
You shoot to kill,
you better hit the heart.

816
01:32:56,114 --> 01:32:57,949
Your own words, Ramon.

817
01:33:14,507 --> 01:33:16,342
The heart, Ramon.

818
01:33:16,676 --> 01:33:18,595
Don't forget the heart.

819
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:24,517
Aim for the heart
or you'll never stop me.

When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

822
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:07,537
you said the man with the
pistol's a dead man.

823
01:35:08,746 --> 01:35:11,332
Let's see if that's true.

824
01:35:34,856 --> 01:35:37,150
Go ahead, load up and shoot.

Hey, listen, Joe.

01:37:44,819 --> 01:37:47,655
Listen, Joe, I...

829
01:37:49,407 --> 01:37:51,534
Oh, Joe, Joe.

(BELL TOLLING)

831
01:38:23,983 --> 01:38:28,196
Well, guess your government will
be glad to see that gold back.

832
01:38:28,279 --> 01:38:32,658
And you, you don't want to be
here when they get it, eh?

833
01:38:34,327 --> 01:38:37,371
You mean, the Mexican
government on one side,

834
01:38:37,455 --> 01:38:39,999
and maybe the Americans
on the other side?

835
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:42,919
Me, right smack
in the middle?

836
01:38:43,002 --> 01:38:44,879
Mmm-mmm.
Too dangerous.
