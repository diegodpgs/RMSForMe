is worth a shit.

dressed up to look like me,

thing around my neck,

going around playing a harmonica?

351

He's somebody you'd remember.

352

Instead of talking, he plays.

And when he'd better
play, he talks.

four, it's easy to make it five.

Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

I only told you to scare them.

I want to see the blue of the

a little more hasty.

Otherwise you ain't changed any.

395
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,916
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

You'll end up giving orders.

It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

How does it feel sitting
behind that desk, Frank?

405
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:39,025
It's almost like holding a gun.

My weapons might look
simple to you, Mr. Morton,

enough for our little problems.

won't be a problem no more.

Clear eyes, strong hands.

429
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:37,453
And he wants to marry you.

430

Which doesn't happen often.

too, which doesn't hurt.

But he bought it.

641
01:40:17,804 --> 01:40:22,450
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

642
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,745
Waited for what?

643
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:29,791
For the rail road to
reach this point.

644
01:40:30,567 --> 01:40:32,860
Ah, but how in the
hell could he be sure

645
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:35,880
the rail road would pass
through his property?

Them steam engines can't
roll without water.

on your mind.

make a profit, too.

about it, if I were you.

that's bigger than you are.

you a lot of new ways.
