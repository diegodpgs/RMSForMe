an anti-bacterial spray.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

What's in the spray, specifically?

286
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,204
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

287

You are not allergic to bacitracin.

Yeah, going for a non-threatening,

- Titanium skeleton?
- TADASHI: Carbon fiber.

Right. Even lighter. (GASPS)

Oh, machined them

Dad, I just wish I could share
my accomplishments with you.

1782
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,329
You mean so much to me,
and honestly,

1783
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,801
I've always felt a distance

1784
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:33,249
what with you being
on the family island all the time,

1785
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,610
and I just wish
you could see how...

Dad?

1789
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:08,201
I wear 'em front,
I wear 'em back.

1790
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:13,487
BOTH: I go inside out,
then I go front and back.
