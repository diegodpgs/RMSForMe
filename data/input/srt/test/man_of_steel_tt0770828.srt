1
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:00,024
<b>Hurry!!</b>

2
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:14,976
Do you not understand?
Krypton's core is collapsing.

3
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,544
We may only have a matter of weeks.
I warned you.

4
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:22,306
Harvesting the core was suicide.
It has accelerated..

5
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:25,281
..the process of implosion.
Our energy reserves..

6
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:27,887
..were exhausted.
What would you have us do, El?

7
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:31,558
Look to the stars, like our ancestors did.

8
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:35,695
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outposts.

9
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:39,662
Are you seriously suggesting
that we evacuate the entire planet?

10
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,337
No. Everybody here is already dead.

11
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:47,699
Give me control of the Codex.
I will ensure the survival of our race.

12
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,736
There is still hope.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,503
I have held that hope in my hands.

14
00:03:07,418 --> 00:03:09,557
This council has been disbanded.

15
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:11,897
On whose authority?

16
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,394
Mine.

17
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:21,439
The rest of you will be tried
and punished accordingly.

18
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:26,155
What are you doing, Zod?
This is madness. What I should have done..

19
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:26,907
..years ago.

20
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:28,206
These lawmakers..

21
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,772
..with their endless debates..

22
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:30,933
..have lead Krypton to ruin.

23
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,951
And if your forces prevail..

24
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:38,853
..you'll be the leader of nothing.
Then join me.

25
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:42,189
Help me save our race. We'll start anew.

26
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:43,454
We'll sever..

27
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:46,463
..the degenerative bloodlines
that led us to this state.

28
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:49,967
And who will decide
which bloodlines survive, Zod?

29
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:52,370
You?

30
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:56,605
Don't do this, El.

31
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:59,313
The last thing I want
is for us to be enemies.

32
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,210
You have abandoned the principles
that bound us together.

33
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,560
You've taken up the sword..

34
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:05,914
..against your own people.

35
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:09,390
I will honor the man you once were, Zod..

36
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:11,793
..not this monster you've become.

37
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:16,428
Take him away.

38
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:23,936
<b>Sir? Is everything all right?</b>

39
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,469
Out of the way.

40
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:26,933
I said..

41
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:44,849
Get me Lara.

42
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:48,356
<b>Jor. Behind you.</b>

43
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:54,258
Lara, you have to ready the launch.

44
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,164
I'll be with you as soon as I can.

45
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:12,146
H'Raka!!

46
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:24,989
Hyah!!

47
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:54,324
Can you see the Codex?
<b> It's just beneath the central hub.</b>

48
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,751
<b>But I'm compelled to warn you.</b>

49
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,229
<b>Breaching the genesis chamber
is a Class B crime..</b>

50
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:02,061
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.
The world is about to come to an end.

51
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:09,898
JorEl, by the
authority of General Zod..

52
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:12,004
..surrender the Codex.

53
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:28,612
Unh!!

54
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:51,337
Ahhh!!

55
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,546
Easy, H'Raka.

56
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:23,739
Did you find a world?

57
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,654
We have.
<b> Orbiting a main sequence yellow star..</b>

58
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,178
<b>..just as you said it would.</b>

59
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:31,477
A young star.

60
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:33,515
His cells will drink its radiation.

61
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:38,887
It's a seemingly intelligent population.

62
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:40,886
He'll be an outcast.

63
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:43,330
A freak.

64
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:45,362
They'll kill him.

65
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,034
How?

66
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:49,097
He'll be a god to them.

67
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:53,567
What if the ship doesn't make it?

68
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:55,532
He'll die out there..

69
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,276
..alone.

70
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,845
I can't do it.

71
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:03,449
I thought I could, but..

72
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:05,448
Lara.
..now that he's here..

73
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:07,616
Krypton is doomed.

74
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:10,688
It's his only chance now.

75
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:12,951
It's our people's only hope.

76
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:15,624
What is it, Kelex?

77
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:17,866
<b>Five attack ships
converging from the east.</b>

78
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:20,432
<b>Citadel's defenses
are being scanned and evaluated.</b>

79
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,600
I'll upload the Codex.

80
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,770
No, wait.

81
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:25,236
Lara.

82
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:28,375
Just let me look at him.

83
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:34,271
We'll never get to see him walk.

84
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,617
Never hear him say our names.

85
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:45,458
But out there..

86
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:47,626
..amongst the stars..

87
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,487
..he will live.

88
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:49,853
Goodbye, my son.

89
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:53,718
Our hopes and dreams travel with you.

90
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:35,232
Concentrate fire on the main doors.

91
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:51,552
<b>Lady Lara.</b>

92
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:54,847
The phantom drives are coming online.
Proceed to ignition.

93
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:56,613
General.

94
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,259
We have identified an engine ignition
within the citadel.

95
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:02,629
A launch.

96
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:06,199
Hold this platform, commander.

97
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:20,548
I know you stole the Codex, JorEl.

98
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:22,706
Surrender it..

99
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:24,941
..and I'll let you live.

100
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:28,112
This is a second chance
for all of Krypton..

101
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:30,722
..not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.

102
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,421
What have you done?

103
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,960
We've had a child, Zod.

104
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:38,330
A boy child.

105
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:41,592
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

106
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,266
And he will be free.

107
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:47,241
Free to forge his own destiny.

108
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:49,577
Heresy.

109
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:52,139
Destroy it.

110
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:02,179
Ah!!

111
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:46,623
Lara..

112
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,167
..listen to me.

113
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:52,032
The Codex is Krypton's future.

114
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:54,741
Abort the launch.

115
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,692
No!!

116
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:46,889
Your son, Lara..

117
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:50,095
..where have you sent him?

118
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,365
His name..

119
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:56,696
..is Kal..

120
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,203
..son of El.

121
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:04,642
And he's beyond your reach.

122
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:16,780
Bring that ship down.

123
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:26,498
Target locked.

124
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:39,835
<b>Lay down your weapons.</b>

125
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:42,007
<b>Your forces are surrounded.</b>

126
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:53,594
General Zod..

127
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:56,593
..for the crimes
of murder and high treason..

128
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,029
..the Council has sentenced you
and your fellow insurgents..

129
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:04,661
..to three hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

130
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:07,971
Do you have any last words?

131
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:12,388
You won't kill us yourself!!

132
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:15,842
You wouldn't sully your hands!!
But you'll damn us..

133
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:18,278
..to a black hole for eternity!!

134
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:21,378
JorEl was right.

135
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:25,319
You're a pack of fools,
every last one of you.

136
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:27,388
And you.

137
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,564
You believe your son is safe?

138
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:33,995
I will find him.

139
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,535
I will reclaim
what you have taken from us.

140
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:41,533
I will find him.

141
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:44,837
I will find him, Lara.

142
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:50,475
I will find him!!

143
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:02,057
Argh!!

144
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:34,814
<b>Lady Lara, shouldn't
you find refuge?</b>

145
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:38,593
There is no refuge, Kelor.

146
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:41,495
JorEl was right.

147
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,331
This is the end.

148
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:00,280
Make a better world than ours, Kal.

149
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:33,930
Watch it, dumb-ass!!

150
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:36,700
Keep your eyes open
or you're gonna get squashed.

151
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:41,147
Where the hell did they find you,
greenhorn?

152
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:42,883
Let's get this trap in the air.

153
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:44,642
<b>Gentlemen, secure the deck.</b>

154
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:47,911
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

155
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:49,452
Secure the deck.

156
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,720
<b>All civilian boats, stand clear.</b>

157
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:58,626
<b>The subsea valves failed
and the rig is about to explode.</b>

158
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:01,328
Roger, Coast Guard.
What about the men left inside?

159
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:03,801
<b> Forget them. They're dead.</b>
Greenhorn..

160
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,097
..fetch me my binoculars.

161
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,973
Greenhorn.

162
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:20,844
This is the last of the oxygen. I don't
know how much longer we can hold out.

163
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:33,987
<b>This is Coast Guard 6510.
We'll make one more pass then get out.</b>

164
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,864
Wait, wait.
I got some guys on the helipad.

165
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:39,768
Right here!!

166
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:47,145
Come on, come on!!
Let's go!! Let's go!!

167
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:49,145
Let's go!!
Let's go!!

168
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:00,962
<b>Get that last guy loaded.</b>

169
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:02,494
<b>We have got to go.</b>

170
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:04,391
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?

171
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:11,630
Go!! Go!!

172
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:14,831
Argh!!

173
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:24,007
Argh!!

174
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:51,569
..when Kansas
became a territory?

175
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:54,747
<b>Clark.</b>

176
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:57,739
Are you listening, Clark?

177
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,858
I asked if you could tell me who first..

178
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,116
..settled Kansas.

179
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:20,534
Are you all right, Clark?

180
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:30,382
Clark.

181
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:32,915
Clark.

182
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:37,082
Clark!!

183
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,619
Clark, come out of there.

184
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:44,228
Leave me alone.

185
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:46,824
Clark, I have called your mother.

186
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:49,227
Clark?

187
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,164
Ah!!

188
00:23:52,328 --> 00:23:53,329
I'm here.

189
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:55,576
Clark, honey, it's Mom.

190
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,002
Will you open the door?

191
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:01,469
What's wrong with him?
He's such a freak.

192
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,312
Crybaby.

193
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:05,017
His parents won't even let him play
with other kids.

194
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:06,275
I know.

195
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:07,351
Sweetie.

196
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:10,650
How can I help you if you won't let me in?

197
00:24:10,913 --> 00:24:13,257
The world's too big, Mom.

198
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:15,120
Then make it small.

199
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:18,760
Just, um..

200
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,694
..focus on my voice.

201
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:27,207
Pretend ifs an island..

202
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:29,274
..out in the ocean.

203
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,108
Can you see it?

204
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:36,840
I see it.

205
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:40,176
Then swim towards it, honey.

206
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:55,299
What's wrong with me, Mom?

207
00:24:57,893 --> 00:24:59,395
Clark.

208
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:01,164
<b>Clark.</b>

209
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:31,702
Did you get everything I need?
Yep.

210
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:33,600
Hold it, hold it.

211
00:26:23,446 --> 00:26:24,982
Hey, asswipe.

212
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:27,221
What do you think? You see the game?

213
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,953
Leave him alone, Pete.
What are you, his girlfriend?

214
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:31,892
I wanna hear what he has to say.

215
00:26:34,256 --> 00:26:34,927
Come on..

216
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:35,828
..dick splash.

217
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:17,826
<b>My son was there.</b>

218
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,267
He was in the bus.

219
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:23,339
He saw what Clark did.
I know he did.

220
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:28,271
I'm sure what he thought he saw was..
Was an act of God, Jonathan.

221
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:31,716
This was providence.

222
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:37,515
I think you're blowing
it out of proportion.

223
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:41,023
No, I'm not. Lana saw it too.

224
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,251
And the Fordham boy.

225
00:28:42,518 --> 00:28:43,724
This isn't the first time..

226
00:28:43,953 --> 00:28:45,899
..Clark's done something like this.

227
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:03,080
I just wanted to help.

228
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,281
I know you did, but we talked about this.

229
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:07,816
Right?

230
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:10,985
Right? We talked about this. You have..

231
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,927
Clark, you have to keep this side
of yourself a secret.

232
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:19,264
What was I supposed to do?
Just let them die?

233
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,470
Maybe.

234
00:29:27,396 --> 00:29:31,401
There's more at stake here than just our
lives, Clark, or the lives of those around us.

235
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,747
When the world..

236
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:40,677
When the world finds out what you can do
it's gonna change everything. Our..

237
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:43,514
Our beliefs, our notions of..

238
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:46,487
..what it means to be human.
Everything.

239
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:49,525
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?

240
00:29:49,785 --> 00:29:51,992
She was scared, Clark.

241
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:53,964
Why?

242
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:58,668
People are afraid
of what they don't understand.

243
00:29:58,927 --> 00:29:59,837
Is she right?

244
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:03,807
Did God do this to me?

245
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:06,869
Tell me.

246
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,323
We found you in this.

247
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:28,234
We were sure the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep..

248
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,470
..but no one ever came.

249
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,646
This was in that chamber with you.

250
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:50,555
I took it to a metallurgist..

251
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:52,156
..at Kansas State.

252
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:54,987
He said whatever it was made from
didn't even..

253
00:30:55,918 --> 00:30:58,694
Didn't even exist on the periodic table.

254
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:01,896
That's another way of saying..

255
00:31:02,057 --> 00:31:04,333
..that it's not from this world, Clark.

256
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:07,702
And neither are you.

257
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,935
You're the answer, son.

258
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:14,579
You're the answer to
"Are we alone in the universe?"

259
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:18,184
I don't wanna be.

260
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:20,284
And I don't blame you, son.

261
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:23,584
It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bear.

262
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:27,259
But you're not just anyone, Clark,
and I have to believe that you were..

263
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,260
That you were sent here for a reason.

264
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,091
All these changes that you're
going through, one day..

265
00:31:34,356 --> 00:31:37,701
One day you're gonna think of them
as a blessing. When that day comes..

266
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:39,371
..you have to make a choice.

267
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:43,600
A choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not.

268
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,041
Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son?

269
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,648
You are my son.

270
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,112
But somewhere out there you've..

271
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:01,056
You have another father too,
who gave you another name.

272
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,040
And he sent you here..

273
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,995
..for a reason, Clark.

274
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:12,432
And even if it takes you the rest of
your life, you owe it to yourself..

275
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:14,800
..to find out what that reason is.

276
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:26,851
<b>Bound by wild desire</b>

277
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:30,113
<b>I fell into a ring of fire</b>

278
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,452
Wait a second.
Aren't you here for the exercise?

279
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:34,401
No, there was a change in the plans.

280
00:32:34,616 --> 00:32:36,687
Somebody found something
strange on Ellesmere.

281
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:39,926
Aircom's making runs out there all week.
That rat hole?

282
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:42,260
You gotta be kidding me.
I know. It's crazy.

283
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:44,198
The Americans are there too,
lots of them.

284
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,295
Anything else? They're
calling it an anomalous object.

285
00:32:47,296 --> 00:32:49,537
Whatever that means.
Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious.

286
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:51,639
Oh, come on, Chrissy.
Knock it off.

287
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,279
Sit down.
Let me go.

288
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:55,175
Hey. Leave her alone, man.

289
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:01,215
Or what, tough guy?

290
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:05,190
Or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

291
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:09,453
I think I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

292
00:33:11,954 --> 00:33:12,728
Ooh.

293
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:21,067
Oh, there he is.

294
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,372
It's not worth it, sweetie.

295
00:33:38,514 --> 00:33:40,892
Hey, asshole,
don't forget your tip.

296
00:33:43,051 --> 00:33:44,860
Strike.

297
00:34:35,404 --> 00:34:36,815
Thanks.

298
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,879
Hi.

299
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:40,814
Miss Lane. How you doing?

300
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:43,283
Good.
Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.

301
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:45,786
How far to the station?

302
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:49,320
Camp's just over the rise.
I'll walk you over. Great.

303
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:51,792
Joe can take your bags. Joe.

304
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:53,294
Help her out.

305
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:56,058
Careful with those. They're heavy.

306
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:00,131
I gotta confess, Miss Lane..

307
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:03,239
..I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet.

308
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:07,603
But those pieces you wrote when you were
embedded with the 1st Division were..

309
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:09,679
Well, they were pretty impressive.

310
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:13,909
Well, what can I say? I get writer's block
if I'm not wearing a flak jacket.

311
00:35:19,615 --> 00:35:20,616
<b>Miss Lane.</b>

312
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:23,489
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom.
Dr. Emil Hamilton..

313
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:24,856
..from DARPA.

314
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,292
You're early.
Hi.

315
00:35:26,521 --> 00:35:28,000
We were expecting you tomorrow.

316
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:30,702
Which is why I showed up today.

317
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,533
Look, let's get one thing straight,
guys, okay?

318
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:36,639
The only reason I'm here
is because we're on Canadian soil..

319
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:40,312
..and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

320
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:42,674
So if we're done measuring dicks..

321
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:45,282
..can you have your people
show me what you found?

322
00:35:47,342 --> 00:35:48,709
<b>NASA's EOS satellites..</b>

323
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,485
..pinged the anomaly first.

324
00:35:50,712 --> 00:35:53,192
The ice shelf plays hell
on the echo soundings.

325
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:55,792
But there's something there.
A submarine, maybe?

326
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:56,826
Sovietera?

327
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:58,656
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.

328
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:01,868
Considerably larger than anything
we know they built back then.

329
00:36:02,124 --> 00:36:03,364
But herds the spooky pan.

330
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:07,039
The ice surrounding the object..

331
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:10,367
..it's nearly twenty thousand years old.

332
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:12,675
<b>Miss Lane?</b>

333
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:15,310
Try not to wander.

334
00:36:15,537 --> 00:36:18,643
Temperatures drop to minus 40
at night around here.

335
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:21,150
Wouldn't find your body till after spring.

336
00:36:24,146 --> 00:36:25,648
And there you go.

337
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:30,696
What if I need to tinkle?

338
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:33,024
There's a bucket in the corner.

339
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:09,395
Where the hell are you going?

340
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,097
Hello?

341
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,689
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. It's all right.

342
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:14,878
You're hemorrhaging internally..

343
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:17,514
..and if I don't cauterize this bleed..

344
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:19,344
How can..?

345
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:22,144
I can do things that other people can't.

346
00:41:23,144 --> 00:41:24,282
Now hold my hand.

347
00:41:25,113 --> 00:41:26,683
This is gonna hurt.

348
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:30,515
<b>What Colonel Hardy
and his team surmised..</b>

349
00:42:30,745 --> 00:42:32,247
<b>..was a Sovietera submarine..</b>

350
00:42:32,514 --> 00:42:34,960
<b>..was actually something
much more exotic.</b>

351
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:39,062
<b>An isotope analysis of the surrounding
ice bores suggests that an object..</b>

352
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:43,133
<b>..had been trapped in the glacier
for over 18,000 years.</b>

353
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:44,927
<b>As for my rescuer?</b>

354
00:42:45,193 --> 00:42:47,571
<b>He disappeared during
the object's departure..</b>

355
00:42:47,962 --> 00:42:50,374
<b>A background check revealed
that his work history..</b>

356

<b>..and identity had been falsified.</b>

<b>..but I also know what I saw.</b>

360
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,279
"And I have arrived
at the inescapable conclusion..

361
00:43:03,545 --> 00:43:05,547
..that the object and its occupant..

362
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,726
..did not originate on Earth."

363
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:12,762
I can't print this, Lois.
You might have hallucinated half of it.

364
00:43:12,987 --> 00:43:15,092
What about the contractors
who corroborated..

365
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:18,497
..my story? The Pentagon is
denying that there was a ship.

366
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,603
Of course they are. They're supposed to.

367
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:22,331
It's the Pentagon.

368
00:43:22,597 --> 00:43:24,270
Perry, it's me we're talking about.

369
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:27,173
I'm a Pulitzer Prizewinning reporter.
Then act like it.

370
00:43:27,435 --> 00:43:29,574
Print it or I walk.
You can't.

371
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:30,839
You're under contract.

372
00:43:33,308 --> 00:43:37,313
I'm not running a story
about aliens walking among us.

373
00:43:43,618 --> 00:43:45,188
Never gonna happen.

374
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:50,834
That's a Scotch, straightup, for the lady.

375
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:52,453
I'm sending you the article.

376
00:43:52,627 --> 00:43:55,107
My editor won't print it,
but if it leaked online..

377
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,638
Got it.

378
00:43:56,865 --> 00:43:59,311
But didn't you once describe my site..

379
00:43:59,534 --> 00:44:02,344
..as a creeping cancer of falsehoods?

380
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:05,508
I stand by my words, Woodburn,
but I want this story..

381
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:06,945
..out there.
Why?

382
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:11,321
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

383
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,640
<b>Recursive diagnostics complete..</b>

384
00:44:28,463 --> 00:44:30,670
<b>Guiding presence authenticated.</b>

385
00:44:30,899 --> 00:44:33,470
<b>All systems operational.</b>

386
00:44:45,547 --> 00:44:49,495
To see you standing there
having grown into an adult..

387
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:53,562
If only Lara could have witnessed this.

388
00:44:54,689 --> 00:44:55,895
Who are you?

389
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:58,871
I am your father, Kal.

390
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:02,105
Or at least a shadow of him.

391
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:04,338
His consciousness.

392
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,206
My name was JorEl.

393
00:45:11,873 --> 00:45:13,511
And Kal?

394
00:45:16,744 --> 00:45:17,950
That's my name.

395
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:22,055
KalEl. It is.

396
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,787
I have so many questions.

397
00:45:27,522 --> 00:45:29,126
Where do I come from?

398
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:32,735
Why did you send me here?

399
00:45:33,561 --> 00:45:35,438
You came from Krypton.

400
00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:42,137
A world with a much harsher environment
than Earths.

401
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,578
Long ago..

402
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:50,050
..in an era of expansion..

403
00:45:50,278 --> 00:45:53,487
..our race spread out through the stars..

404
00:45:53,748 --> 00:45:56,456
..seeking new worlds to settle upon.

405
00:45:57,585 --> 00:46:01,089
This scout ship was
one of thousands launched into the void.

406
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:06,264
We built outposts on other planets..

407
00:46:06,494 --> 00:46:10,237
Musing great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

408
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:16,438
For 100,000 years,
our civilization flourished..

409
00:46:17,972 --> 00:46:19,974
..accomplishing wonders.

410
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:22,780
What happened?

411
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:27,851
Artificial population control
was established.

412
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:32,190
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned.

413
00:46:32,787 --> 00:46:35,358
We exhausted our natural resources.

414
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:39,628
As a result,
our planet's core became unstable.

415
00:46:42,096 --> 00:46:44,633
Eventually, our military leader..

416
00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:48,780
..General Zod, attempted a coup.

417
00:46:50,705 --> 00:46:52,878
But by then it was too late.

418
00:46:54,142 --> 00:46:56,782
Your mother and I foresaw
the coming calamity..

419
00:46:57,011 --> 00:46:59,821
..and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

420
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:03,521
<b>This is a genesis chamber.</b>

421
00:47:04,385 --> 00:47:07,525
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

422
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:11,498
Every child was designed to fulfill
a predetermined role in our society..

423
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:12,568
..as a worker..

424
00:47:12,827 --> 00:47:15,967
..a warrior, a leader and so on.

425
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:19,474
Your mother and I believed Krypton
lost something precious.

426
00:47:19,701 --> 00:47:21,908
The element of choice, of chance.

427
00:47:22,403 --> 00:47:24,576
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something..

428
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:27,342
Mother than what society
had intended for him or her?

429
00:47:28,876 --> 00:47:31,482
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

430
00:47:32,246 --> 00:47:34,248
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

431
00:47:34,515 --> 00:47:36,995
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

432
00:47:38,086 --> 00:47:40,760
That's why we risked so much to save you.

433
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:43,334
Why didn't you come with me?

434
00:47:46,861 --> 00:47:48,602
We couldn't, Kal.

435
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:50,665
No matter how much..

436
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:52,104
..we wanted to.

437
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,602
No matter how much we loved you.

438
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,747
Your mother, Lara, and I..

439
00:47:57,004 --> 00:48:00,110
..were a product of the failures
of our world as much as Zod was..

440
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:02,048
..tied to its fate.

441
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:04,347
So I'm alone.
No.

442
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,755
You're as much a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

443
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:13,191
You can embody the best of both worlds.

444
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:17,062
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

445
00:48:21,596 --> 00:48:24,577
The people of Earth
are different from us, it's true.

446
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:27,746
But, ultimately,
I believe that's a good thing.

447
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:30,415
They won't necessarily
make the same mistakes we did.

448
00:48:30,638 --> 00:48:32,618
Not if you guide them, Kal.

449
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:36,245
Not if you give them hope.

450
00:48:39,647 --> 00:48:41,820
That's what this symbol means.

451
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,894
The symbol of the house of El
means hope.

452
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,622
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief..

453
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:51,803
..in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

454
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:54,964
That's what you can bring them.

455
00:49:15,149 --> 00:49:16,992
<b>Why am I so different from them?</b>

456
00:49:18,252 --> 00:49:20,755
<b>Earth's sun is younger and brighter
than Krypton's was.</b>

457
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:25,035
<b>Your cells have drunken its radiation..</b>

458
00:49:25,293 --> 00:49:29,298
<b>..strengthening your muscles,
your skin, your senses.</b>

459
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:33,836
<b>Earth's gravity is weaker,
yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.</b>

460
00:49:35,136 --> 00:49:38,140
<b>You've grown stronger here
than I ever could have imagined.</b>

461
00:49:38,372 --> 00:49:39,976
<b>The only way to know how strong..</b>

462
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:44,182
<b>..is to keep testing your limits.</b>

463
00:50:02,964 --> 00:50:03,635
Unh!!

464
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:13,182
Uh.. Oh.

465
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:16,083
Whoa!!

466
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:40,435
<b>You will give the people of Earth
an ideal lo strive towards.</b>

467
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:43,912
<b>They'll race behind you.</b>

468
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:45,548
<b>They will stumble.</b>

469
00:50:45,773 --> 00:50:46,911
<b>They will fall.</b>

470
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:48,881
<b>But In time..</b>

471
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:53,051
<b>..they will join you in the sun, Kal.</b>

472
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:56,256
<b>In time..</b>

473
00:50:56,584 --> 00:50:59,190
<b>you will help them accomplish wonders.</b>

474
00:52:21,602 --> 00:52:25,550
<b>How do you find someone who has
spent a lifetime covering his tracks?</b>

475
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,544
<b>You start with the urban legends..</b>

476
00:52:27,808 --> 00:52:30,152
<b> ..that have sprung up in his wake.</b>
That's Joe.

477
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:31,789
<b>The friends of a friend..</b>

478
00:52:32,013 --> 00:52:34,015
<b> ..who have seen him.</b>
He worked here.

479
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:37,125
<b>For some he was a guardian angel.
For others, a cipher..</b>

480
00:52:37,351 --> 00:52:39,126
<b>..a ghost who never quite fit in.</b>

481
00:52:40,021 --> 00:52:41,500
<b>Well, I was saying we were..</b>

482
00:52:41,722 --> 00:52:42,962
<b>..coming towards the oil rig.</b>

483
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,330
<b>As you work your way back in time,
the stories form a pattern.</b>

484
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:49,132
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
Do you know him?

485
00:52:49,363 --> 00:52:52,207
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.
If you go down the road..

486
00:52:54,135 --> 00:52:54,840
Pete Ross?

487
00:52:57,171 --> 00:53:00,380
I'd like to talk to you about an accident
when you were younger.

488
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:03,144
A school bus that went into the river.

489
00:53:08,649 --> 00:53:10,754
Dusty. Shhshhshh.

490
00:53:10,918 --> 00:53:11,988
Mrs. Kent?

491
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,866
I'm Lois Lane. I'm from the <b>Daily Planet.</b>

492
00:53:15,923 --> 00:53:16,663
Quiet.

493
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:21,729
I'm from the Daily Planet
and I'd like to talk to you about your son.

494
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:43,852
I figured if I turned over enough stones
you'd eventually find me.

495
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:52,461
Where are you from?
What are you doing here?

496
00:53:52,727 --> 00:53:54,070
Let me tell your story.

497
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:57,435
What if I don't want my story told?

498
00:53:57,698 --> 00:53:59,473
It's going to come out eventually.

499
00:53:59,734 --> 00:54:02,772
Somebody's going to get a photograph
or figure out where you live.

500
00:54:03,037 --> 00:54:05,984
Then I'll disappear again.
The only way you could disappear..

501
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,245
..is to stop helping people altogether,
and I sense that's not an option for you.

502
00:54:14,415 --> 00:54:18,420
My father believed that if the world
found out who I really was..

503
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:21,422
..they'd reject me..

504
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:23,794
..out of fear.

505
00:54:25,826 --> 00:54:27,897
<b>I'm tired of safe.</b>

506
00:54:28,129 --> 00:54:30,234
I just wanna do something useful
with my life.

507
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:33,070
So farming, feeding people.
That's not useful?

508
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,300
I didn't say that.

509
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:36,642
Our family's been farming
for five generations.

510
00:54:36,771 --> 00:54:38,682
Your family, not mine.

511
00:54:38,939 --> 00:54:41,920
I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
You're not my dad.

512
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:43,520
You're just some guy
who found me in a field.

513
00:54:43,778 --> 00:54:44,950
Clark.

514
00:54:47,314 --> 00:54:48,987
It's all right, Martha.

515
00:54:50,818 --> 00:54:52,923
He's right. Clark has a point.

516
00:54:53,487 --> 00:54:54,522
We're not your parents.

517
00:54:56,624 --> 00:54:58,331
But we've been doing the best we can.

518
00:54:58,592 --> 00:55:01,971
And we've been making this up
as we go along, so maybe..

519
00:55:02,196 --> 00:55:04,608
Maybe our best
isn't good enough anymore.

520
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:11,674
Look, Dad..

521
00:55:11,939 --> 00:55:13,384
Hold on.

522
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:34,834
Go for the overpass.

523
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:37,734
Go for the overpass!!

524
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:41,705
Take cover!! Take cover!!

525
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:44,347
Over there. Just follow them.
Take cover.

526
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:49,247
She's stuck.

527
00:55:53,814 --> 00:55:55,691
Hank's still in the car.

528
00:55:56,517 --> 00:55:57,552
Hank's in the car.

529
00:55:58,419 --> 00:56:00,558
I'll get him, I'll get him.
No, no.

530
00:56:01,088 --> 00:56:03,329
Get your mom to the overpass.

531
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:23,518
Hank!! Hank!! Come!!

532
00:56:32,419 --> 00:56:33,625
Jonathan!!
Mom, ifs okay.

533
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:56,087
Jonathan!!
Mom, stay here.

534
00:57:21,902 --> 00:57:24,405
Dad!!

535
00:57:26,941 --> 00:57:30,013
<b>I let my father die
because I trusted him.</b>

536
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:34,825
Because he was convinced
that I had to wait.

537
00:57:35,582 --> 00:57:37,755
That the world was not ready.

538
00:57:39,486 --> 00:57:41,124
What do you think?

539
00:57:46,026 --> 00:57:47,664
You better watch out, Lois.

540
00:57:48,162 --> 00:57:50,472
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

541
00:57:50,698 --> 00:57:54,475
He knows you're Woodburn's anonymous source
and cannot wait to rip you a new one.

542
00:57:56,837 --> 00:57:58,282
Oh, look at her. Ha, ha, ha.

543
00:58:00,274 --> 00:58:02,811
I told you not to run with this,
and what do you do?

544
00:58:03,043 --> 00:58:05,546
You let Woodburn just shotgun it
all over the Internet.

545
00:58:05,813 --> 00:58:08,692
Now the publishers want me to sue you.

546
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:12,192
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.

547
00:58:12,453 --> 00:58:13,454
Whoa, just like that?

548
00:58:13,687 --> 00:58:14,688
Yep.

549
00:58:15,055 --> 00:58:16,363
What happened to your leads?

550
00:58:17,024 --> 00:58:19,664
They didn't pan out. The story is smoke.

551
00:58:19,893 --> 00:58:21,839
Or it didn't get the traction you hoped?

552
00:58:24,198 --> 00:58:25,040
Two weeks leave..

553
00:58:25,299 --> 00:58:26,903
..no pay, that's your penance.

554
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:28,840
You try something like this again..

555
00:58:29,069 --> 00:58:30,742
..you're done here.
Fine.

556
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:33,713
Let's make it three weeks
since you're so willing to agree.

557
00:58:33,974 --> 00:58:35,476
Perry.
No, no. Don't. Don't.

558
00:58:37,144 --> 00:58:38,817
I believe you saw something, Lois.

559
00:58:39,313 --> 00:58:42,317
But not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold.

560
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:46,053
So whatever your reasons are
for dropping it..

561
00:58:47,087 --> 00:58:48,930
..I think you're doing the right thing.

562
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:50,730
Why?

563
00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:55,733
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react..

564
00:58:57,998 --> 00:59:01,445
..if they knew there was
someone like this out there?

565
00:59:19,586 --> 00:59:20,587
Go get him.

566
00:59:27,428 --> 00:59:29,066
Well, look at you.

567
00:59:46,113 --> 00:59:47,922
A reporter came by here.

568
00:59:48,482 --> 00:59:50,723
She's a friend. Don't worry.

569
00:59:51,452 --> 00:59:52,795
Oh.

570
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,596
Mom.

571
00:59:54,755 --> 00:59:56,496
Heh, heh, heh.
What?

572
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:00,495
I found them.
Who?

573
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:02,830
My parents.

574
01:00:03,997 --> 01:00:05,340
My People.

575
01:00:06,233 --> 01:00:09,442
I know where I come from now.

576
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:12,112
Wow.

577
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:14,948
That's wonderful.

578
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,256
I'm so happy for you, Clark.

579
01:00:28,088 --> 01:00:30,625
What?
It's nothing.

580
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:36,274
When you were a baby I used to lay
by your crib at night..

581
01:00:36,497 --> 01:00:38,875
..listening to you breathe.

582
01:00:39,933 --> 01:00:41,537
It was hard for you.

583
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:44,146
You struggled.

584
01:00:44,371 --> 01:00:46,214
And I worried all the time.

585
01:00:46,473 --> 01:00:48,316
You worried the truth would come out.

586
01:00:49,843 --> 01:00:51,049
No.

587
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:54,618
The truth about you is beautiful.

588
01:00:55,048 --> 01:00:58,495
We saw that the moment
we laid eyes on you.

589
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:04,792
We knew that one day,
the whole world would see that.

590
01:01:07,227 --> 01:01:08,865
I'm just..

591
01:01:09,496 --> 01:01:11,567
I'm worried they'll take you away from me.

592
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,178
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.

593
01:01:18,005 --> 01:01:19,507
I promise.

594
01:01:25,712 --> 01:01:27,885
General Swanwick, sir.

595
01:01:28,148 --> 01:01:31,891
What am I looking at, doc?
Comet? Asteroid?

596
01:01:33,053 --> 01:01:37,058
Comets don't make
course corrections, general.

597
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:43,865
Wanted you to see this before some amateur
with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.

598
01:01:45,532 --> 01:01:46,909
The ship appears to have..

599
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:49,909
..inserted itself into
a lunar synchronous orbit..

600
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,343
..though I have no idea why.

601
01:01:52,573 --> 01:01:55,417
Have you tried.. communicating with it?

602
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:59,681
Well, they haven't responded as of yet.

603
01:02:00,948 --> 01:02:04,953
I'm just speculating, but I think
whoever's at the helm of that thing..

604
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:07,722
..is looking to make a dramatic entrance.

605
01:02:14,595 --> 01:02:16,075
Anybody know where we keep the toner?

606
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:18,941
What's going on?
It's all over the news.

607
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:21,145
You gotta see this.

608
01:02:48,128 --> 01:02:49,630
Clark.

609
01:02:49,997 --> 01:02:51,135
Yeah?

610
01:02:51,398 --> 01:02:52,741
Coming.

611
01:02:53,066 --> 01:02:55,267

635
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:30,228
<b>Surrender within 24 hours..</b>

636

<b>..or watch this world

637
01:05:41,401 --> 01:05:42,072

<b>We hardly know anything

01:06:08,929 --> 01:06:11,671
<b> Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane..</b>
Hello?

646
01:06:11,932 --> 01:06:14,435
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.

647
01:06:14,668 --> 01:06:16,978
For once I agree with Woodburn.
Have you seen him?

648
01:06:17,204 --> 01:06:20,515
<b> Do you know where he is?</b>
No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say.

649
01:06:20,774 --> 01:06:23,948
The entire world is being threatened here.

650
01:06:24,177 --> 01:06:25,815
<b>This is not time for you to fall..</b>

651
01:06:26,046 --> 01:06:28,390
<b>..back on journalistic integrity.</b>

652
01:06:28,648 --> 01:06:30,127
<b>This is serious, Lois.</b>

653
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:33,331
<b>The FBI is here. They're throwing around
words like "treason."</b>

654
01:06:33,553 --> 01:06:35,226
I gotta go.

655
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:52,714
FBI. Hands up.

656
01:06:52,973 --> 01:06:54,748
Drop the bag. Now.

657
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:04,008
<b>Regarding the visitors
themselves we know..</b>

658
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,596
<b>..very little.
According to government officials..</b>

659
01:07:06,853 --> 01:07:09,333
<b>..the visitors do not
represent a threat..</b>

660
01:07:09,556 --> 01:07:11,729
<b>..despite the ominous tone
of their message.</b>

661
01:07:11,992 --> 01:07:14,495
<b>Then of course there's the question
on everyone's mind:</b>

662
01:07:14,728 --> 01:07:18,540
<b>"Who is this KaiEl person?
Does he actually exist?"</b>

663
01:07:18,765 --> 01:07:21,439
<b>"How could he have remained
hidden from us for so long?"</b>

664
01:07:26,072 --> 01:07:27,380
Come on, Kent.

665
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:35,551
Come on. Fight back.

666
01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:37,386
Get up, Kent.

667
01:07:40,687 --> 01:07:42,064
So is that it?

668
01:07:42,522 --> 01:07:44,024
Is that all you've got?

669
01:07:45,692 --> 01:07:47,194
Come on, Kent.

670
01:07:48,428 --> 01:07:49,805
Come on!!

671
01:08:18,425 --> 01:08:19,563
Did they hurl you?

672
01:08:20,827 --> 01:08:22,238
You know they can't.

673
01:08:22,596 --> 01:08:25,475
That's not what I meant.
I meant, are you all right?

674
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:29,777
I wanted to hit that kid.
I wanted to hit him bad.

675
01:08:30,003 --> 01:08:31,482
I know you did. I mean..

676
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:34,446
..part of me even wanted you to,
but then what?

677
01:08:35,141 --> 01:08:36,313
Make you feel any better?

678
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,684
You just have to decide what kind of man
you want to grow up to be, Clark.

679
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:47,659
Because whoever that man is,
good character or bad, he's..

680
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:51,428
He's gonna change the world.

681
01:08:56,663 --> 01:08:58,024
<b>What's on your mind?</b>

682
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:05,044
I don't know where to start.

683
01:09:05,672 --> 01:09:07,276
Wherever you want.

684
01:09:09,442 --> 01:09:11,547
That ship that appeared last night.

685
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:14,688
I'm the one they're looking for.

686
01:09:19,185 --> 01:09:20,687
Do you know..

687
01:09:21,488 --> 01:09:22,626
..why they want you?

688
01:09:22,856 --> 01:09:25,462
No. But this General Zod..

689
01:09:25,692 --> 01:09:29,697
..even if I surrender, there's no
guarantee he'll keep his word, but..

690
01:09:29,963 --> 01:09:33,968
..if there's a chance I can save Earth
by turning myself in..

691
01:09:35,568 --> 01:09:36,706
..shouldn't I take it?

692
01:09:38,204 --> 01:09:40,081
What does your gut tell you?

693
01:09:40,807 --> 01:09:42,514
Zod can't be trusted.

694
01:09:45,145 --> 01:09:46,715
The problem is..

695
01:09:47,747 --> 01:09:50,353
..I'm not sure the people of Earth
can be either.

696
01:09:58,358 --> 01:10:01,339
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first.

697
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:04,766
The trust part comes later.

698
01:10:28,922 --> 01:10:31,630
All right. You've got our attention.

699
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:33,126
What is it you want?

700
01:10:33,393 --> 01:10:35,202
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

701
01:10:35,428 --> 01:10:37,108
What makes you think she's here?

702
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:39,701
Don't play games with me, general.

703
01:10:39,933 --> 01:10:43,938
I'll surrender, but only if you
guarantee Lois's freedom.

704
01:10:54,047 --> 01:10:55,993
<b>Why are you surrendering to Zod?</b>

705
01:10:57,217 --> 01:11:00,824
I'm surrendering to mankind.
There's a difference.

706
01:11:01,955 --> 01:11:03,901
You let them handcuff you?

707
01:11:04,624 --> 01:11:07,070
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

708
01:11:08,561 --> 01:11:10,598
And if it makes them feel more secure..

709
01:11:11,664 --> 01:11:13,507
..then all the better for it.

710
01:11:17,937 --> 01:11:19,109
What's the S stand for?

711
01:11:22,742 --> 01:11:24,312
It's not an S.

712
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:27,349
On my world it means hope.

713
01:11:29,315 --> 01:11:32,819
Well, here, it's an S.

714
01:11:34,854 --> 01:11:36,424
How about..

715
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,761
..Super..

716
01:11:41,995 --> 01:11:43,030
Sir?

717
01:11:43,296 --> 01:11:46,641
Hi, my name is Dr. E..
Emil Hamilton.

718
01:11:46,866 --> 01:11:49,847
I know, I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket.

719
01:11:50,103 --> 01:11:52,140
Along with a halfeaten roll of Lifesavers.

720
01:11:53,306 --> 01:11:55,650
I can also see the soldiers
in the next room..

721
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:58,185
..preparing that tranquilizing agent
of yours.

722
01:11:58,444 --> 01:11:59,889
You won't need it.

723
01:12:00,146 --> 01:12:03,184
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions.

724
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:05,861
You could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

725
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:07,564
Been here for 33 years, doctor.

726
01:12:07,821 --> 01:12:11,735
Haven't infected anyone yet.
That you know of. We have legitimate..

727
01:12:11,991 --> 01:12:15,370
..security concerns. You revealed
your identity to Miss Lane over there.

728
01:12:16,362 --> 01:12:18,569
Why won't you do the same with us?

729
01:12:19,532 --> 01:12:21,876
Let's put our cards on the table here,
general.

730
01:12:23,336 --> 01:12:25,056
You're scared because you can't control me.

731
01:12:25,638 --> 01:12:28,175
You don't, and you never will.

732
01:12:29,008 --> 01:12:30,988
But that doesn't' mean I'm your enemy.

733
01:12:31,211 --> 01:12:32,713
Then who is?

734
01:12:32,979 --> 01:12:34,390
Zod?

735
01:12:35,014 --> 01:12:36,425
That's what I'm worried about.

736
01:12:37,016 --> 01:12:38,723
Be that as it may..

737
01:12:38,985 --> 01:12:41,761
..I've been given orders
to hand you over to him.

738
01:12:42,989 --> 01:12:44,866
Do what you have to do, general.

739
01:12:49,662 --> 01:12:50,436
Thank you.

740
01:12:51,564 --> 01:12:52,542
For what?

741
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,270
For believing in me.

742
01:12:58,338 --> 01:13:00,375
Didn't make much difference in the end.

743
01:13:01,207 --> 01:13:02,743
It did to me.

744
01:13:23,363 --> 01:13:24,899
They're coming.

745
01:13:25,698 --> 01:13:27,200
You should leave now.

746
01:13:30,303 --> 01:13:31,873
Go, Lois.

747
01:14:42,775 --> 01:14:44,152
KalEl.

748
01:14:44,677 --> 01:14:46,714
I'm subcommander FaoraUI.

749
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:50,657
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

750
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:59,795
Are you the ranking officer here?
I am.

751
01:15:00,026 --> 01:15:02,006
General Zod would like this woman..

752
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:03,866
..to accompany me.

753
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,071
You asked for the alien.

754
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,347
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

755
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,710
Shall I tell the general
you're unwilling to comply?

756
01:15:13,973 --> 01:15:15,850
I don't care what you tell him.

757
01:15:18,845 --> 01:15:20,256
It's all right.

758
01:15:21,347 --> 01:15:22,553
I'll go.

759
01:16:05,391 --> 01:16:09,237
The atmospheric composition on our ship
is not compatible with humans.

760
01:16:09,462 --> 01:16:10,873
You need to wear a breather..

761
01:16:11,097 --> 01:16:12,770
..beyond this point.

762
01:16:37,924 --> 01:16:38,834
KalEl.

763
01:16:40,793 --> 01:16:42,431
You have no idea how long..

764
01:16:42,662 --> 01:16:44,733
..we've been searching for you.

765
01:16:45,164 --> 01:16:46,165
I take it you're Zod?

766
01:16:46,432 --> 01:16:47,570
General Zod.

767
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,609
Our commander.
It's all right, Faora.

768
01:16:49,836 --> 01:16:52,510
We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.

769
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:54,683
He's a stranger to our ways.

770
01:16:54,941 --> 01:16:55,976
This should be cause..

771
01:16:56,242 --> 01:16:59,280
..for celebration, not conflict.

772
01:16:59,512 --> 01:17:01,685
Unh.
Not conflict.

773
01:17:04,117 --> 01:17:05,152
I..

774
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:06,624
..feel strange.

775
01:17:09,355 --> 01:17:10,663
Weak.

776
01:17:12,859 --> 01:17:14,059
What's happening to him?

777
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:16,797
He's rejecting our
ship's atmospherics.

778
01:17:17,029 --> 01:17:17,632
Clark.

779
01:17:17,864 --> 01:17:20,538
You've spent a lifetime
adapting to Earth's ecology..

780
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:21,644
..but never adapted to ours.

781
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:22,836
Help him.

782
01:17:23,102 --> 01:17:24,638
I can't. Whatever's happening..

783
01:17:24,871 --> 01:17:27,112
..has to run its course.
Clark.

784
01:17:28,474 --> 01:17:29,782
Help him.

785
01:17:31,544 --> 01:17:32,716
Help him.

786
01:17:44,357 --> 01:17:45,893
Hello, Kal.

787
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,630
Or do you prefer Clark?

788
01:17:50,363 --> 01:17:51,740
That's the name they gave you.

789
01:17:51,998 --> 01:17:53,306
Isn't it?

790
01:17:54,567 --> 01:17:56,308
I was Krypton's military leader..

791
01:17:56,536 --> 01:17:58,982
..your father our foremost scientist.

792
01:17:59,205 --> 01:18:00,650
The only thing we agreed on..

793
01:18:00,873 --> 01:18:03,649
..was that Krypton was dying.
In return for my efforts..

794
01:18:03,876 --> 01:18:06,413
..to protect our civilization..

795
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:08,750
..and save our planet..

796
01:18:09,015 --> 01:18:13,020
..I and my fellow officers
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

797
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:19,231
<b>And then the
destruction of our world..</b>

798
01:18:19,492 --> 01:18:20,994
<b>..freed us.</b>

799
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:29,669
<b>We were adrift, destined to float..</b>

800
01:18:29,902 --> 01:18:31,848
<b>..amongst the ruins of our planet..</b>

801
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:33,948
<b>..until we starved.</b>

802
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,520
<b>How did you find your way to Earth?</b>

803
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:41,215
<b>We managed to retrofit
the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.</b>

804
01:18:41,714 --> 01:18:44,888
<b>Your father made a similar modification
to the craft that brought you here.</b>

805
01:18:46,919 --> 01:18:50,025
<b>And so the instrument of our damnation..</b>

806
01:18:52,058 --> 01:18:53,867
<b>..became our salvation.</b>

807
01:18:58,798 --> 01:19:01,301
<b>We sought out the old colonial outposts..</b>

808
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:03,774
<b>..looking for signs of life.</b>

809
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,049
<b>But all we found was death.</b>

810
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:12,613
<b>Cut off from Krypton, these outposts..</b>

811
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:15,085
<b>..withered and died long ago.</b>

812
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:17,561
<b>We salvaged what we could..</b>

813
01:19:17,783 --> 01:19:19,490
<b>..armor, weapons..</b>

814
01:19:19,752 --> 01:19:21,663
<b>..even a world engine.</b>

815
01:19:23,422 --> 01:19:25,299
<b>For 33 years we prepared..</b>

816
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:29,568
<b>..until finally we detected
a distress beacon..</b>

817
01:19:29,795 --> 01:19:31,604
<b>..which you triggered..</b>

818
01:19:31,831 --> 01:19:34,072
<b>..when you accessed
the ancient scout ship.</b>

819
01:19:35,468 --> 01:19:38,005
You led us here, Kal.

820
01:19:39,138 --> 01:19:40,481
Now it's within your power..

821
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:44,347
..to save what remains of your race.

822
01:19:49,115 --> 01:19:50,355
On Krypton..

823
01:19:50,616 --> 01:19:53,256
..the genetic template
for every being yet to be born..

824
01:19:53,486 --> 01:19:56,023
..is encoded in the registry of citizens.

825
01:19:56,689 --> 01:19:58,828
Your father stole the registry's Codex..

826
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:01,935
..and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

827
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:03,470
For what purpose?

828
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:07,272
So that Krypton can live again..

829
01:20:08,134 --> 01:20:09,670
..on Earth.

830
01:20:29,522 --> 01:20:31,627
Where is the Codex, Kal?

831
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:35,135
If Krypton lives again..

832
01:20:36,295 --> 01:20:37,672
..what happens to Earth?

833
01:20:38,698 --> 01:20:42,202
The foundation has to be
built on something.

834
01:20:42,468 --> 01:20:45,244
Even your father recognized that.

835
01:20:51,711 --> 01:20:54,021
No, Zod.

836
01:20:55,181 --> 01:20:56,387
I can't be a part of this.

837
01:20:57,216 --> 01:20:58,923
Then what can you be a part of?

838
01:20:59,518 --> 01:21:00,724
No!!

839
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:02,524
Zod!!

840
01:21:04,023 --> 01:21:04,728
No!!

841
01:21:05,891 --> 01:21:07,529
No!!

842
01:21:13,566 --> 01:21:14,726
Your father acquitted..

843
01:21:14,934 --> 01:21:16,936
..himself with honor, Kal.

844
01:21:19,839 --> 01:21:21,785
You killed him?

845
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:23,517
I did.

846
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:27,523
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

847
01:21:28,881 --> 01:21:31,225
But if I had to do it again, I would.

848
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:34,920
I have a duty to my people..

849
01:21:35,187 --> 01:21:39,192
..and I will not allow anyone
to prevent me from carrying it out.

850
01:21:55,641 --> 01:21:57,279
What's the sitrep, major?

851
01:21:57,910 --> 01:22:00,288
DSP pinged two bogeys
launching from the alien ship.

852
01:22:00,546 --> 01:22:02,651
Put it up.
Yes, sir.

853
01:22:03,082 --> 01:22:04,152
There it is.

854
01:22:04,417 --> 01:22:05,225
Retask IKon4..

855
01:22:05,451 --> 01:22:07,897
..and get me a closer look.
Yes, sir.

856
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:09,387
Command, the word..

857
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:10,560
..of the day is trident.

858
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:12,895
We have two alien craft
on aggressive approach.

859
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:14,763
Ikon4 coming online.

860
01:22:14,994 --> 01:22:15,802
Air speed?

861
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:17,581
380 knots, entering Kansas..

862
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:19,732
..airspace.
Not responding to our hails.

863
01:22:19,965 --> 01:22:22,172
You're wasting your efforts.

864
01:22:23,102 --> 01:22:25,446
The strength you derived
from the Earth's sun..

865
01:22:25,671 --> 01:22:27,776
..has been neutralized aboard our ship.

866
01:22:28,441 --> 01:22:29,579
Here..

867
01:22:29,809 --> 01:22:31,413
..in this environment..

868
01:22:32,178 --> 01:22:33,657
..you are as weak as a human.

869
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:37,158
Unh!!

870
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,258
Unh!!

871
01:23:32,204 --> 01:23:34,047
Where did you come from?

872
01:23:34,573 --> 01:23:36,018
The command key, Miss Lane.

873
01:23:36,242 --> 01:23:38,688
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
to the ship's mainframe.

874
01:23:39,912 --> 01:23:40,890
Who are you?

875
01:23:41,847 --> 01:23:43,155
I am Kai's father.

876
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:45,557
Can you help us?

877
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,363
I designed this ship.

878
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:51,761
I can modify its atmospheric composition..

879
01:23:52,024 --> 01:23:53,765
..to human compatibility.

880
01:23:54,026 --> 01:23:54,868
We can stop them.

881
01:23:55,094 --> 01:23:57,574
We can send them back
to the Phantom Zone.

882
01:23:58,531 --> 01:23:59,168
How?

883
01:23:59,398 --> 01:24:00,934
I can teach you.

884
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,009
And in turn, you can teach Kal.

885
01:24:03,235 --> 01:24:04,942
Will you help me?

886
01:24:18,784 --> 01:24:20,224
The ship's crew are alerted.

887
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,387
We need to move quickly.

888
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,293
Retrieve the command key.

889
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,968
Did you do that?
Yes. Pick up her sidearm.

890
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:44,752
What's happening?

891
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:06,402
To your right.

892
01:25:06,632 --> 01:25:07,269
Fire.

893
01:25:08,834 --> 01:25:09,574
Behind you.

894
01:25:23,082 --> 01:25:25,119
Secure yourself inside the open pod.

895
01:25:26,151 --> 01:25:28,427
Safe travels, Miss Lane. It's unlikely..

896
01:25:28,654 --> 01:25:30,258
..we'll see each other again.

897
01:25:31,824 --> 01:25:34,930
Remember, the phantom drives
are essential in stopping them.

898
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:37,034
Move your head to the left.

899
01:26:04,623 --> 01:26:06,534
Is it true what Zod said about the Codex?

900
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,037
Strike that panel.

901
01:26:12,698 --> 01:26:13,870
We wanted you to learn..

902
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:16,238
..what it meant to be human first..

903
01:26:16,869 --> 01:26:20,510
..so that one day, when the time was
right, you could be the bridge..

904
01:26:20,739 --> 01:26:22,514
..between two peoples.

905
01:26:25,244 --> 01:26:26,018
Look.

906
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:30,421
Lois.

907
01:26:31,016 --> 01:26:32,051
You can save her, Kal.

908
01:26:35,187 --> 01:26:37,064
You can save all of them.

909
01:27:55,968 --> 01:27:57,504
You'll be safe here.

910
01:27:59,838 --> 01:28:02,409
Are you all right?
Yeah.

911
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:07,123
I'm sorry.

912
01:28:07,846 --> 01:28:10,827
I didn't wanna tell them anything,
but they did something to me.

913
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:13,256
They looked inside my mind..
It's okay, Lois.

914
01:28:13,485 --> 01:28:15,260
They did the same thing to me.

915
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:29,676
Clark!!

916
01:28:38,677 --> 01:28:40,452
The craft he arrived in..

917
01:28:40,979 --> 01:28:42,151
..where is it?

918
01:28:44,049 --> 01:28:45,221
Go to hell.

919
01:28:56,528 --> 01:28:57,506
There.

920
01:28:58,897 --> 01:28:59,568
Unh!!

921
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:22,658
The Codex is not here.

922
01:29:23,755 --> 01:29:25,029
Argh!!

923
01:29:26,091 --> 01:29:27,593
Ah!!

924
01:29:29,394 --> 01:29:30,515
Where has he hidden it?

925
01:29:30,696 --> 01:29:31,333
I don't know.

926
01:29:31,563 --> 01:29:32,667
Where is the Codex?!!

927
01:29:36,702 --> 01:29:38,045
Ahh!!

928
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,626
You think you can threaten my mother?!!

929
01:29:56,221 --> 01:29:57,222
Ah!!

930
01:30:32,424 --> 01:30:33,903
What have you done to me?

931
01:30:34,126 --> 01:30:36,572
My parents taught me to hone..

932
01:30:36,795 --> 01:30:38,274
..my senses, Zod.

933
01:30:39,965 --> 01:30:41,569
Focus..

934
01:30:42,134 --> 01:30:43,841
..on just what I wanted to see.

935
01:30:44,102 --> 01:30:45,137
Without your helmet..

936
01:30:45,404 --> 01:30:46,974
..you're getting everything.

937
01:30:47,172 --> 01:30:48,082
Unh!!

938
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,651
And it hurts..

939
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:51,619
..doesn't it?

940
01:31:02,487 --> 01:31:03,989
Argh!!

941
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:37,729
Get away from the window.

942
01:31:40,692 --> 01:31:42,501
Get inside. It's not safe.

943
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:50,712
<b>All players, this is

Argh!!

964
01:33:27,099 --> 01:33:27,975
You are weak..

01:33:28,233 --> 01:33:29,337
..son of El.

966
01:33:29,601 --> 01:33:30,739
Unsure of yourself.

967
01:33:35,974 --> 01:33:38,955

a sense of morality..

968

..and we do not..

..it is that evolution always wins.

01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:05,541
Ragh!!

973
01:34:10,308 --> 01:34:11,480
Unh!!

974
01:34:24,523 --> 01:34:26,025
<b>CCT, we're approaching..</b>

975
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:28,134
<b>..LZ Jayhawk. Get down in five.</b>

976
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:30,203
Let's go. Go to the LZ.

977
01:34:30,996 --> 01:34:32,317
Roger, sarge. let's go!!

978
01:35:09,768 --> 01:35:11,089
<b>All rangers, I need you..</b>

979
01:35:11,336 --> 01:35:12,508
..to engage the targets.

980
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:14,125
Guardian, this is Badger 01.

981
01:35:14,339 --> 01:35:15,613
What about the guy in blue?

982
01:35:15,874 --> 01:35:16,909
<b>I said engage..</b>

983
01:35:17,175 --> 01:35:18,347
<b>..all targets.</b>

984
01:35:29,521 --> 01:35:30,561
<b>Contact. Contact.</b>

985
01:35:34,926 --> 01:35:35,802
Ah!!

986
01:35:40,732 --> 01:35:41,574
You okay?

987
01:35:47,305 --> 01:35:49,410
We're autorotating, going in hard.

988
01:35:50,141 --> 01:35:51,313
Brace for impact.

989
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:53,248
Brace for impact.

990
01:35:53,478 --> 01:35:54,456
We're going in hard!!

991
01:35:59,551 --> 01:36:03,556
<b>Fallen angel. Fallen angel.
 Guardian is down.I repeat, Guardian is down.</b>

992
01:36:25,477 --> 01:36:26,979
<b>Guardian, do you read?</b>

993
01:36:27,245 --> 01:36:28,588
<b>Thunder 12, calling Guardian.</b>

994
01:36:28,813 --> 01:36:30,156
<b> Do you read?</b>
Thunder 12..

995
01:36:30,415 --> 01:36:31,325
..this is Guardian.

996
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,961
Put down everything you've got
north of my position.

997
01:36:34,185 --> 01:36:36,358
<b> This will be dangerclose.</b>
Copy, dangerclose.

998
01:36:36,621 --> 01:36:37,861
<b>Good luck, sir.</b>

999
01:37:17,729 --> 01:37:20,573
A good death is its own reward.

1000
01:37:34,179 --> 01:37:35,556
You will not win.

1001
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:38,517
For every human you save..

1002
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:41,424
..we will kill a million more. Unh!!

1003
01:38:32,737 --> 01:38:35,911
<b>Do we have an all clear?
Do we have an all clear?</b>

1004

<b>Alpha team, sitrep. Alpha team.</b>

1005
01:38:38,643 --> 01:38:40,247
<b>Do you copy? Alpha team.</b>

1006
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:31,968
This man is not our enemy.

1007
01:39:34,432 --> 01:39:35,968
Thank you, colonel.

1008
01:39:53,818 --> 01:39:54,660
Mom?

1009
01:39:55,954 --> 01:39:57,627
I'm all right.

1010
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:11,647
Nice suit, son.

1011
01:40:12,704 --> 01:40:14,012
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:17,349
It's only stuff, Clark.

1013
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:20,922
It can always be replaced.

1014
01:40:23,381 --> 01:40:24,655
But you can't be.

1015
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:28,396
Mom, Zod said this Codex..

1016
01:40:28,653 --> 01:40:30,929
..he's looking for can
bring my people back.

1017
01:40:31,256 --> 01:40:32,929
Isn't that a good thing?

1018
01:40:37,161 --> 01:40:39,664
I don't think they're interested
in sharing this world.

1019
01:40:40,265 --> 01:40:41,505
Clark.

1020
01:40:42,233 --> 01:40:43,109
Clark.

1021
01:40:45,003 --> 01:40:46,880
I know how to stop them.

1022
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:50,385
What happened down there?

1023
01:40:50,608 --> 01:40:53,452
He exposed a temporary weakness.

1024
01:40:54,345 --> 01:40:56,188
It is of little consequence..

1025
01:40:57,549 --> 01:41:00,462
..because I have located the Codex.

1026
01:41:01,252 --> 01:41:03,528
It was never in the capsule.

1027
01:41:04,122 --> 01:41:05,795
<b>Jorel took the Codex..</b>

1028
01:41:06,057 --> 01:41:08,537
<b>..the DNA of a billion people,
then he bonded it..</b>

1029
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,569
<b>..within his son's individual..</b>

1030
01:41:10,795 --> 01:41:11,739
<b>..cells.</b>

1031
01:41:11,963 --> 01:41:13,567
<b>All of Krypton's heirs..</b>

1032
01:41:13,798 --> 01:41:17,245
<b>..living hidden in one refugee's body.</b>

1033
01:41:21,306 --> 01:41:23,286
Does KalEl need to be alive..

1034
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:26,715
..for us to extract the
Codex from his cells?

1035
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:29,251
No.

1036
01:41:35,153 --> 01:41:37,429
Release the world engine.

1037
01:42:09,654 --> 01:42:10,598
What just happened?

1038
01:42:10,755 --> 01:42:11,927
The ship just split in two.

1039
01:42:12,156 --> 01:42:15,262
Track one is heading east,
track two to the southern hemisphere.

1040
01:42:15,493 --> 01:42:18,161
How fast is that bogey moving?
Approaching..

1041
01:42:18,162 --> 01:42:19,607
..Mach 24 and accelerating.

1042
01:42:19,831 --> 01:42:22,505
It's gonna impact
somewhere in the Indian Ocean.

1043
01:42:41,219 --> 01:42:42,857
The rest of the ship is descending.

1044
01:42:43,855 --> 01:42:45,222
Put it on the board now.

1045
01:42:45,223 --> 01:42:46,293
Yes, sir.

1046
01:42:47,325 --> 01:42:48,497
Oh, my God.

1047
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,776
Bring the phantom drive online.

1048
01:43:53,391 --> 01:43:55,234
We are now slave to the world engine.

1049
01:43:56,961 --> 01:43:58,372
Initiate.

1050
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:35,843
What have they hit us with?
Looks like some kind of gravity..

1051
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:38,637
..weapon.
It's working in tandem with their ship.

1052
01:44:40,071 --> 01:44:43,143
Somehow they're increasing
the Earth's mass..

1053
01:44:43,407 --> 01:44:45,512
..clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

1054
01:44:47,245 --> 01:44:48,849
Oh, my God.

1055
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:51,182
They're terraforming.

1056
01:44:51,949 --> 01:44:52,757
What's that?

1057
01:44:53,584 --> 01:44:54,688
Planetary engineering..

1058
01:44:54,952 --> 01:44:58,161
..modifying the Earth's atmosphere
and topography.

1059
01:44:58,422 --> 01:44:59,662
Turning Earth into Krypton.

1060
01:45:00,358 --> 01:45:03,498
But what happens to us?
Based on these readings..

1061
01:45:03,761 --> 01:45:06,765
..there won't be an "us."
General Swanwick, sir.

1062
01:45:07,165 --> 01:45:08,542
I'm on with the control tower.

1063
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,041
Colonel Hardy's on his way
and he's got Superman in tow.

1064
01:45:11,769 --> 01:45:12,839
Superman?

1065
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:14,543
The alien, sir.

1066
01:45:14,806 --> 01:45:17,184
That's what they're calling him.
Superman.

1067
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,886
We have a plan, general.

1068
01:45:24,148 --> 01:45:25,627
Is that what I think it is?

1069
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,559
It's the ship he arrived in.

1070
01:45:30,221 --> 01:45:32,861
This ship is powered by something
called a phantom drive.

1071
01:45:33,124 --> 01:45:34,569
It bends space.

1072
01:45:34,826 --> 01:45:38,797
Zod's ship uses the same technology, and
if we can make the two drives collide..

1073
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:40,873
A singularity can be created.

1074
01:45:41,132 --> 01:45:42,572
Like a black hole.
Yes.

1075
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,202
So if we open up this doorway..

1076
01:45:44,468 --> 01:45:46,072
..they should be pulled back in.

1077
01:45:46,337 --> 01:45:48,840
So you want us to bomb them with that?

1078
01:45:49,073 --> 01:45:51,053
General, that craft maxes out..

1079
01:45:51,309 --> 01:45:54,688
..17,000 pounds,
we can drop it from a C17.

1080
01:45:54,912 --> 01:45:56,050
It's a viable plan.

1081
01:45:56,314 --> 01:45:58,419
If I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean..

1082
01:45:58,683 --> 01:46:00,390
..the gravity field will continue..

1083
01:46:00,651 --> 01:46:01,994
..to expand.

1084
01:46:07,758 --> 01:46:10,534
If that thing is making Earth
more like Krypton..

1085
01:46:10,895 --> 01:46:12,431
..won't you be weaker around it?

1086
01:46:14,232 --> 01:46:15,540
Maybe.

1087
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,880
I'm not about to let that
stop me from trying.

1088
01:46:19,837 --> 01:46:22,044
You might want to step back a little bit.

1089
01:46:24,108 --> 01:46:25,246
Maybe a little bit more.

1090
01:46:57,708 --> 01:46:58,311
Faora.

1091
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:00,414
Take command.

1092
01:47:00,645 --> 01:47:03,785
Yes, sir.
I need to secure the genesis chamber..

1093
01:47:04,215 --> 01:47:06,957
..and pay my respects to an old friend.

1094
01:47:14,725 --> 01:47:16,830
Guardian en route to Metropolis..

1095
01:47:17,628 --> 01:47:18,834
..package in tow.

1096
01:47:24,101 --> 01:47:27,014
<b>Be advised,
F35s inbound to rendezvous point.</b>

1097
01:47:27,271 --> 01:47:29,444
<b>You should have visual contact now.</b>

1098
01:48:14,452 --> 01:48:18,127
<b>Command key accepted.
Genesis chamber coming online, sir.</b>

1099
01:48:18,522 --> 01:48:19,522
Stop this, Zod..

1100
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:21,829
..while there's still time.

1101
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:26,371
Haven't given up lecturing me,
have you, even in death?

1102
01:48:26,731 --> 01:48:28,733
I will not let you use the Codex like this.

1103
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,707
You don't have the power to stop me.

1104
01:48:30,968 --> 01:48:34,006
The command key I have entered
is revoking your authority.

1105
01:48:34,238 --> 01:48:37,151
This ship is now under my control.

1106
01:49:08,672 --> 01:49:10,352
Northcom, Lightning 1, request..

1107
01:49:10,508 --> 01:49:13,068
..permission to unleash the hounds.
<b>Lightning 1..</b>

1108
01:49:13,177 --> 01:49:16,624
..you are clear to engage. Send battle
damage assessment when able. Out.

1109
01:49:30,194 --> 01:49:32,572
<b>Avionics are going haywire.
The gravity field..</b>

1110
01:49:32,797 --> 01:49:35,141
<b>..is pulling our missiles down.
We gotta get closer.</b>

1111
01:49:40,237 --> 01:49:41,437
All right, everybody..

1112
01:49:41,539 --> 01:49:44,418
..we're leaving.
We're leaving the building now.

1113
01:50:07,565 --> 01:50:09,442
I just lost my wingman.

1114
01:50:11,802 --> 01:50:12,940
Mayday!! Mayday!! Mayday!!

1115
01:50:24,515 --> 01:50:26,495
Everybody, this way!! Come on!!

1116
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,822
Everybody, come on!!
Keep moving, keep moving.

1117
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:37,695
Jenny!!

1118
01:50:41,665 --> 01:50:42,507
Oh, my God.

1119
01:50:42,766 --> 01:50:43,767
Perry!!

1120
01:50:48,205 --> 01:50:50,151
Go!! There!! Go!!

1121
01:50:56,013 --> 01:50:57,515
Our people can coexist.

1122
01:50:58,149 --> 01:51:02,154
So we can suffer through years of pain
trying to adapt like your son has?

1123
01:51:02,987 --> 01:51:04,660
You're talking about genocide.
Yes.

1124
01:51:04,889 --> 01:51:07,495
And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost.

1125
01:51:08,859 --> 01:51:10,668
We're both ghosts, Zod.

1126
01:51:10,895 --> 01:51:14,399
Can't you see that?
The Krypton you're clinging onto is gone.

1127
01:51:14,665 --> 01:51:17,236
Ship, have you managed to quarantine
this invasive intelligence?

1128
01:51:17,501 --> 01:51:18,422
You'll fail.
<b> I have.</b>

1129
01:51:18,636 --> 01:51:20,047
Then prepare to terminate it.

1130
01:51:20,304 --> 01:51:22,079
I'm tired of this debate.
Silencing me..

1131
01:51:22,339 --> 01:51:23,750
..won't change anything.

1132
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:27,318
My son..

1133
01:51:28,145 --> 01:51:29,488
..is twice the man you were.

1134
01:51:32,483 --> 01:51:34,156
And he will finish what we started.

1135
01:51:35,085 --> 01:51:36,325
I can promise you that.

1136
01:51:41,525 --> 01:51:42,902
Tell me..

1137
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:46,733
..you have JorEl's memories,
his conscience.

1138
01:51:47,431 --> 01:51:48,432
Can you experience..

1139
01:51:48,699 --> 01:51:49,837
..his pain?

1140
01:51:51,869 --> 01:51:55,442
I will harvest the Codex
from your son's corpse..

1141
01:51:55,906 --> 01:51:58,216
..and I will rebuild Krypton..

1142
01:51:58,442 --> 01:52:00,945
..atop his bones.

1143
01:52:29,273 --> 01:52:30,581
Argh!!

1144
01:52:58,636 --> 01:52:59,341
Jenny.

1145
01:52:59,603 --> 01:53:02,345
Jenny. Jenny, where are you?
I'm here!!

1146
01:53:02,606 --> 01:53:03,906
I'm here. Here.
Jenny.

1147
01:53:03,907 --> 01:53:05,409
Hold on, hold on.

1148
01:53:05,643 --> 01:53:06,621
I'm stuck.

1149
01:53:06,844 --> 01:53:08,517
I can't get free. I'm stuck.
Okay.

1150
01:53:08,779 --> 01:53:11,316
We'll get you out of there, all right?
Just sit tight.

1151
01:53:11,582 --> 01:53:12,151
No, no, no!!

1152
01:53:12,416 --> 01:53:14,217
Don't leave me.
We're not gonna leave you.

1153
01:53:14,351 --> 01:53:15,523
Okay.
Lombard!!

1154
01:53:15,786 --> 01:53:19,131
Get your ass over here and help me.
Damn it.

1155
01:53:21,125 --> 01:53:23,105
We just gotta move this.
Here.

1156
01:53:23,327 --> 01:53:25,364
Slide that in. You push, I'll pull, okay?

1157
01:53:25,629 --> 01:53:26,664
Go.

1158
01:53:30,868 --> 01:53:32,176
Push!!
Oh, my God.

1159
01:53:32,436 --> 01:53:34,270
It's getting closer!!
Come on, push!!

1160
01:53:36,106 --> 01:53:38,313
Northcom, this is Guardian.
Are we cleared?

1161
01:53:38,842 --> 01:53:39,843
Negative, Guardian.

1162
01:54:04,568 --> 01:54:07,014
Come on!! Push!!

1163
01:54:07,204 --> 01:54:08,205
Ahh!!

1164
01:54:33,197 --> 01:54:35,177
Argh!!

1165
01:54:59,022 --> 01:55:00,365
He did it.

1166
01:55:02,559 --> 01:55:03,799
Northcom, this is Guardian.

1167
01:55:04,061 --> 01:55:06,302
We're passing through phase line red.
Good to go.

1168
01:55:06,563 --> 01:55:07,730
Godspeed, Guardian.

1169
01:55:07,731 --> 01:55:10,143
Arm the package. You are cleared hot.

1170
01:55:10,401 --> 01:55:12,472
We're lining up for the final run.

1171
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:15,272
It's up to you and Hamilton now.

1172
01:55:55,446 --> 01:55:56,446
You gotta be kidding me.

1173
01:55:56,447 --> 01:55:57,887
Loadmaster, is the package..

1174
01:55:58,115 --> 01:55:59,116
..ready to drop?

1175
01:55:59,349 --> 01:56:00,623
Negative, Guardian.

1176
01:56:00,851 --> 01:56:02,421
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.

1177
01:56:02,653 --> 01:56:04,428
What's it supposed to do?

1178
01:56:04,655 --> 01:56:07,693
It's supposed to go in all the way.
Let me take a look.

1179
01:56:07,958 --> 01:56:09,528
Copilot's aircraft.

1180
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:11,762
Copilot's aircraft.

1181
01:56:18,502 --> 01:56:21,176
We are lined up for the drop.
What's the hold up?

1182
01:56:21,438 --> 01:56:22,439
We've had a setback.

1183
01:56:38,188 --> 01:56:39,690
Target that aircraft.

1184
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:45,005
Target locked.

1185
01:56:54,805 --> 01:56:55,681
Stop!!

1186
01:56:55,906 --> 01:56:58,011
If you destroy this ship..

1187
01:56:58,242 --> 01:57:00,916
..you destroy Krypton!!

1188
01:57:03,714 --> 01:57:05,887
Krypton had its chance.

1189
01:57:07,417 --> 01:57:09,192
Argh!!

1190
01:57:59,870 --> 01:58:01,747
Miss Lane!! It's not safe for you..

1191
01:58:01,972 --> 01:58:02,882
..over there!!

1192
01:58:03,106 --> 01:58:03,709
Miss Lane!!

1193
01:58:05,309 --> 01:58:06,549
Ah!!

1194
01:58:33,604 --> 01:58:35,345
Move now!! Go!!

1195
01:58:56,193 --> 01:58:57,194
A good death..

1196
01:58:57,461 --> 01:58:59,031
..is its own reward.

1197
01:59:06,637 --> 01:59:08,014
Ah!!

1198
01:59:29,559 --> 01:59:30,629
Ah!!

1199
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:48,822
Argh!!

1200
02:00:01,491 --> 02:00:02,936
Are they gone?

1201
02:00:04,094 --> 02:00:05,505
I think so.

1202
02:00:07,397 --> 02:00:08,740
He saved us.

1203
02:00:34,224 --> 02:00:37,433
You know, they say it's all downhill
after the first kiss.

1204
02:00:40,897 --> 02:00:43,935
I'm pretty sure that only counts
when you're kissing a human.

1205
02:01:13,296 --> 02:01:14,775
Look at this.

1206
02:01:17,067 --> 02:01:18,978
We could have built a new Krypton..

1207
02:01:19,236 --> 02:01:20,977
..in this squalor.

1208
02:01:21,238 --> 02:01:24,344
But you chose the humans over us.

1209
02:01:25,776 --> 02:01:27,312
I exist..

1210
02:01:27,577 --> 02:01:29,989
..only to protect Krypton.

1211
02:01:31,748 --> 02:01:35,753
That is the sole purpose
for which I was born.

1212
02:01:36,987 --> 02:01:39,126
And every action I take..

1213
02:01:39,356 --> 02:01:41,358
..no matter how violent..

1214
02:01:41,625 --> 02:01:43,332
..or how cruel..

1215
02:01:44,528 --> 02:01:46,940
..is for the greater good..

1216
02:01:47,164 --> 02:01:49,110
..of my people.

1217
02:01:53,436 --> 02:01:54,847
And now..

1218
02:01:55,105 --> 02:01:57,381
..I have no people.

1219
02:02:00,811 --> 02:02:02,381
My soul..

1220
02:02:04,481 --> 02:02:08,019
..that is what you have taken..

1221
02:02:08,285 --> 02:02:09,889
..from me.

1222
02:02:16,793 --> 02:02:19,296
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.

1223
02:02:19,529 --> 02:02:22,976
These humans you've adopted,
I will take them all from you..

1224
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:26,181
..one by one.
You're a monster, Zod..

1225
02:02:28,805 --> 02:02:30,011
..and I'm gonna stop you.

1226
02:02:42,485 --> 02:02:43,691
Argh!!

1227
02:02:51,995 --> 02:02:52,666
Argh!!

1228
02:04:11,608 --> 02:04:12,409
There's only..

1229
02:04:12,575 --> 02:04:13,918
..one way this ends, Kal.

1230
02:04:14,144 --> 02:04:15,987
Either you die..

1231
02:04:16,246 --> 02:04:17,020
..or I do.

1232
02:04:38,201 --> 02:04:39,111
Unh!!

1233
02:04:48,678 --> 02:04:50,817
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

1234
02:04:51,681 --> 02:04:53,319
Trained my entire life..

1235
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:55,393
..to master my senses.

1236
02:04:55,885 --> 02:04:59,492
Where did you train? On a farm?

1237
02:06:51,267 --> 02:06:52,905
Argh!!

1238
02:07:08,418 --> 02:07:09,863
If you love..

1239
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:12,464
..these people so much..

1240
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:15,465
..you can mourn for them.

1241
02:07:19,929 --> 02:07:20,999
Don't do this!!

1242
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:25,008
Stop!!

1243
02:07:31,374 --> 02:07:32,352
Stop!!

1244
02:07:34,711 --> 02:07:35,849
Never.

1245
02:08:05,842 --> 02:08:07,344
Ahh!!

1246
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:11,917
Are you effing stupid?

1247
02:09:12,141 --> 02:09:14,109
It's one of
your surveillance drones.

1248
02:09:14,110 --> 02:09:16,613
That's a $12,000,000
piece of hardware.

1249
02:09:16,779 --> 02:09:17,814
It was.

1250
02:09:18,615 --> 02:09:21,152
I know you're trying to find out
where I hang my cape.

1251
02:09:21,751 --> 02:09:23,230
You won't.
Then I'll ask..

1252
02:09:23,453 --> 02:09:24,761
..the obvious question:

1253
02:09:25,221 --> 02:09:28,225
How do we know you won't one day
act against America's interests?

1254
02:09:28,925 --> 02:09:30,768
I grew up in Kansas, general.

1255
02:09:31,227 --> 02:09:33,400
I'm about as American as it gets.

1256
02:09:33,663 --> 02:09:34,573
Look..

1257
02:09:34,797 --> 02:09:36,276
..I'm here to help..

1258
02:09:36,499 --> 02:09:38,740
..but it has to be on my own terms.

1259
02:09:38,968 --> 02:09:40,811
You have to convince Washington of that.

1260
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:45,075
Even if I were willing to try,
what makes you think they'd listen?

1261
02:09:46,142 --> 02:09:47,746
I don't know, general.

1262
02:09:49,145 --> 02:09:50,852
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

1263
02:10:00,423 --> 02:10:01,800
What are you smiling about?

1264
02:10:02,625 --> 02:10:03,968
Nothing, sir.

1265
02:10:07,130 --> 02:10:09,110
I just think he's kind of hot.

1266
02:10:11,267 --> 02:10:13,372
Get in the car, captain.
Mmhm. Yes, sir.

1267
02:10:23,346 --> 02:10:26,555
He always believed
you were meant for greater things.

1268
02:10:26,816 --> 02:10:28,318
And that when the day came..

1269
02:10:28,551 --> 02:10:31,361
..your shoulders would be able
to bear the weight.

1270
02:10:31,621 --> 02:10:35,467
Yeah, I just wish he could have
been here to see it finally happen.

1271
02:10:35,892 --> 02:10:37,872
He saw it, Clark, believe me.

1272
02:11:25,375 --> 02:11:28,219
<b>What are you going to do
when you're not saving the world?</b>

1273
02:11:28,444 --> 02:11:32,187
Have you given any thought to that?
I have, actually. Heh, heh.

1274
02:11:33,783 --> 02:11:37,788
I gotta find a job
where I can keep my ear to the ground.

1275
02:11:43,025 --> 02:11:45,096
<b>Where people won't look twice..</b>

1276
02:11:45,361 --> 02:11:49,138
<b>..when I want to go somewhere dangerous
and start asking questions..</b>

1277
02:12:03,246 --> 02:12:06,284
Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?

1278
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:09,223
Courtside seats to the game tonight.

1279
02:12:09,652 --> 02:12:11,222
What do you say?
I say..

1280
02:12:11,454 --> 02:12:13,991
..you should go back
to trolling the intern pool.

1281
02:12:14,257 --> 02:12:17,636
You'll probably have more luck. Sorry.

1282
02:12:19,429 --> 02:12:20,100
Courtside?

1283
02:12:20,329 --> 02:12:22,070
Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
No.

1284
02:12:22,298 --> 02:12:25,108
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.

1285
02:12:25,334 --> 02:12:28,577
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.

1286
02:12:28,805 --> 02:12:30,113
Good luck, kid.

1287
02:12:31,641 --> 02:12:32,915
Hey. Steve.

1288
02:12:33,142 --> 02:12:34,643
Nice to meet you.
You too.

1289
02:12:34,644 --> 02:12:35,486
Hi.

1290
02:12:36,412 --> 02:12:37,755
Lois Lane.

1291
02:12:38,581 --> 02:12:40,117
Welcome to the <b>Planet.</b>
