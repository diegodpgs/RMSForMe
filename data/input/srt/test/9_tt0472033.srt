2
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:59,067
We had such, potential.
Such promise.

3
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:04,524
But we squandered our gifts,
our intelligence.

4
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,858
Our blind pursuit
of technology...

5
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:13,157
only sped us quicker
to our doom.

6
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:19,601
Our world is ending...

7
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:23,626
but life must go on.

8
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:29,539
Wait, I'm a friend.

9
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:43,636
Yes. I always hoped...

10
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,732
so much thought...

11
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:53,730
The details, carved wood.

12
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:56,441
Molded copper.

13
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,862
You can't speak?

14
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:08,828
Ah'ha...

15
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,751
Come with me.

16
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,638
Here. Stop!

17
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:32,038
Some things in this world...

18
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:35,104
are better left
where they lie.

19
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:38,358
But if you know
where to look...

20
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,111
these ruins are full of riches.

21
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,115
Wait, wait.

22
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,264
Almost there.

23
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:52,399
Friend... friend?

24
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:55,500
- Friend.
- Friend.

25
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:04,425
What's this?

26
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,597
You've found it.

27
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,102
He's... uh,
he's always drawing this.

28
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:19,983
Are... are we alone?

29
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:21,860
No, no...

30
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:25,280
Shh...

31
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:29,075
Go.

32
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,833
Get in the can, go on.

33
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,315
Huh...

34
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:48,863
Hey, hey, hey...

35
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,077
Why don't you finish,
what you started...

36
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:55,870
with me.

37
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:56,598
No, no, no. No.

38
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,274
It's alright.

39
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,853
I'm not gonna hurt you.

40
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:05,148
You're safe now.

41
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,741
Where am I?

42
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:13,031
With us. I never expected
to see another one.

43
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,456
There... that should hold.

44
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:18,828
If Two were here, he would
have done a better job.

45
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:22,123
- I wonder where he has gone to?
- I was with him.

46
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:24,799
Two? Where, out there?

47
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,129
- What did he...?
- Keeping secrets from me, I see?

48
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:31,216
I was coming to tell you.

49
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,932
What's this?

50
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:37,263
I found him, in the emptiness.

51
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,890
What were you doing out there?

52
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:41,191
You know the beast.

53
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:43,109
How many times have I told you?

54
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:47,148
The Beast? That's what took Two.
If we hurry, we can save him.

55
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:49,651
The beast took him?
That's the end of it.

56
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:50,985
But he was still alive.

57
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,404
No! We have rules!

58
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:04,339
Our new guest seems confused.

59
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:08,795
Perhaps I can help you
teach some clarity.

60
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:34,362
- It didn't kill him?
- Quiet.

61
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:48,293
Hold on.

62
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,294
When we woke in this world...

63
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:33,219
it was chaos.

64
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:39,594
Man and machine, attacked
each other, with fire and metal.

65
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,565
I found others.

66
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:59,656
There's a gap ahead.

67
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,784
Follow me.

68
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:16,608
The gas...
killed, everything.

69
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:20,215
I led us here...

70
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,120
to sanctuary.

71
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:25,533
and here we waited
for the war to end.

72
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:28,950
Slowly the world, became silent.

73
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:32,332
The only thing
that remains now...

74
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:34,667
is the beast.

75
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:37,093
So, we stay hidden...

76
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:41,389
and we wait for it to...
to sleep.

77
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:44,636
But where did it come from?
Why is it hunting us?

78
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:46,686
Questions like that,
are pointless.

79
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:50,308
We need to protect ourselves.
Keep ourselves out of danger.

80
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:54,562
Too many of us
have already been lost.

81
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:58,441
But he isn't lost.

82
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:02,487
- Why aren't you listening to me?
- Two, chose his own path!

83
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,033
I suggest you avoid
making the same mistake.

84
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,962
Go to the watch tower...

85
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:16,751
and take our guest, with you.

86
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:21,608
This was the first thing
we built together.

87
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:25,069
- We can still go after him?
- Us?

88
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:28,031
But he could be anywhere
out there.

89
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:33,460
Ah, that's where it took him.

90
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:35,330
Down towards those
three tall shapes.

91
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:41,753
Oh, no! We can't!
Not there.

92
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:44,005
We have rules.

93
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:50,637
- Why'd you listen to One?
- A group must have a leader.

94
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:53,348
But what if he's wrong?

95
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,859
Come with me.

96
00:16:57,894 --> 00:17:00,063
I can't do it alone.

97
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:02,106
I...

98
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,360
I... I can't.

99
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,076
But...

100
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,906
Wouldn't he have come for you?

101
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:27,006
Wait.

102
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:34,389
We're going to need a map.

103
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:38,983
Actually, I don't mind having one eye.

104
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:43,356
It's easier for me. I can concentrate
on one thing at a time. You know?

105
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:10,300
Why was he out here alone?

106
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:32,780
- Where's this tunnel?
- I don't know.

107
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:37,410
Wait!

108
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:50,340
We should go back.

109
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,968
We can't.

110
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:07,440
The, beast.

111
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:12,237
It's too dark.

112
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:18,451
We can use that.

113
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,274
Wait.

114
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:07,959
Two, would be impressed.

115
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:14,632
We'll find him.

116
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:25,643
You know, you're just like him. You
forget to remember, to be scared.

117
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:49,709
Can I wait here?

118
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:09,604
Why would he bring him here?

119
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:54,649
Two!

120
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:58,945
Two!

121
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:12,375
I knew you would come.

122
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,794
I thought...?

123
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:52,665
Dirty thing.

124
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,967
- Seven?
- I don't believe it.

125
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:59,065
- You've come back.
- I never left.

126
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,318
You've finally decided
to join the fight.

127
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:08,908
You dropped this.

128
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,708
Where have you been hiding?

129
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:15,874
Rusty and hectic gathered,
shiny pile of scrap.

130
00:24:18,793 --> 00:24:20,587
Ohh...

131
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:25,800
You did it, friend.

132
00:24:25,884 --> 00:24:28,094
I never thought...

133
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:50,992
Wait. What're you doing?

134
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:54,162
You don't even know
what it is.

135
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:10,720
No! Two!

136
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:58,643
Jump!

137
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:30,258
Hurry, quick.

138
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:18,806
What're you waiting for?

139
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,559
Keep running.

140
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,145
Come on.

141
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:49,671
I knew we should't have come.
Why? Why did you do that?

142
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:52,841
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

143
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:57,512
I'm sorry.

144
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,560
What were you thinking?

145
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:13,027
What's it going to do?

146
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:15,572
I know where we can find answers.

147
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:12,795
~?~? begin.

148
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:30,522
Is this, what it was like?

149
00:29:32,857 --> 00:29:35,860
Keep up.

150
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:06,349
Oh, they've been here,
the whole time?

151
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:09,310
Twins.

152
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:12,939
They've been hiding here,
lost in the past.

153
00:30:12,974 --> 00:30:15,316
Looking for answers.

154
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:21,406
They're cataloguing.

155
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:35,635
We need your help.

156
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:40,049
- We awakened, something.
- No, I awakened, something.

157
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:42,886
Something terrible.

158
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:52,896
That's it!

159
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,186
Today, the, chancellor presented
the latest advancement...

160
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:35,647
of technological wizardry
to the public.

161
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,739
Comrades!

162
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:40,026
Today begins a new era.

163
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:44,030
Let us praise
this new technology.

164
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:48,827
Welcome, to the age
of the machine.

165
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:52,539
It will make new machines,
in it's own image.

166
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:54,506
Machines of peace.

167
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:57,460
Letting us know
the glorious new era...

168
00:31:57,495 --> 00:32:00,380
of wealth and prosperity
for the state.

169
00:32:09,222 --> 00:32:13,101
Governors are advised to pause,
for a public address.

170
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:18,356
Science has turned
it's sinister eyes against us.

171
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:21,901
People of our mighty state.

172
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:28,658
Join me in repelling
the iron fist of the machine.

173
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,215
But the thing that woke it,
it... it was round and...

174
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,635
and engraved
with strange shapes.

175
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:54,274
The shapes corresponded.

176
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:57,812
It fit perfectly,
into the machine.

177
00:32:57,847 --> 00:33:00,607
I think it was made for it.

178
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:03,526
That's what Six, always draws.

179
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,118
Six?

180
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:08,114
Two, collected his drawings.

181
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:11,075
He was always studying them.

182
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:15,538
- I have to see them.
- What?

183
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:17,797
Go back to, One?

184
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:21,961
So he can lock us away,
while this nightmare awakens?

185
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,714
Never.

186
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:53,910
Alright... alright,
where did he put them?

187
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:56,245
Here somewhere.

188
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,181
Here. Here.

189
00:33:58,216 --> 00:34:00,083
There they are.

190
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:02,627
Right?

191
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:11,803
You awakened, what?

192
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:13,978
You fools.

193
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:16,648
- I warned you.
- He warned you.

194
00:34:16,683 --> 00:34:19,734
Now you've awoke
unimaginable, terror.

195
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:25,233
And may I ask, did you manage
to save, Two? Of course not.

196
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:26,908
By following this wickless fool,

197
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:29,327
you've endangered everything
we've worked for.

198
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:33,158
- Why was Two sent out, to begin with?
- I sent him. To scout.

199
00:34:33,193 --> 00:34:34,499
That doesn't make any sense.

200
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:37,558
You don't send
the oldest out to... Look...

201
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:40,582
we need to figure out,
what's going on.

202
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:44,377
The source... The source...

203
00:34:45,044 --> 00:34:49,257
Go back, to the source...

204
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:53,261
This is it! This is what
wakened the machine.

205
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:56,639
What do you know about this?

206
00:34:57,348 --> 00:34:59,858
Now you can't be trusted.

207
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:02,604
I wont allow you,
to endanger us further.

208
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,480
Subjugate them.

209
00:35:04,522 --> 00:35:07,775
- Sub... What?
- You illiterate crimp...

210
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:10,028
Take their belongings.

211
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:16,034
- Hey...
- Wait!

212
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:24,751
You're nothing but a coward.

213
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,179
How dare you challenge me?

214
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:32,348
I, who kept everyone safe
all these years.

215
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:35,929
Ever since you got here,
everything has been unravelling.

216
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:38,396
You're a curse! A fool.

217
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:42,602
- Guided by pointless queries.
- And you... are a blind man.

218
00:35:42,637 --> 00:35:45,271
Guided by fear.

219
00:35:48,942 --> 00:35:54,155
Sometimes fear...
is the appropriate response.

220
00:36:09,796 --> 00:36:12,090
No-o-o!...

221
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:25,436
- Nine!
- Go!

222
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:41,161
- Nine!
- Keep going, I'll find a way down.

223
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:28,666
Come on.

224
00:38:24,556 --> 00:38:27,517
Let me try that again.

225
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:35,859
The cable! Pull it!

226
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:51,583
Grab on.

227
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:03,761
Grab the wire.

228
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:22,822
Your cape... let it go.

229
00:39:22,857 --> 00:39:25,008
I can't.

230
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:27,160
Do it now!

231
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:46,262
It's only a cape.

232
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:46,591
There will be more,
wont there?

233
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:49,177
Yes.

234
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:51,909
It's not safe here.

235
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:54,224
Stand look out.

236
00:41:58,937 --> 00:42:02,649
I'll search out a safer retreat.

237
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:21,435
- What... what is it?
- The source.

238
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,522
That thing
that woke the machine.

239
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:27,817
- Go back, go back.
- Back to where?

240
00:43:27,852 --> 00:43:29,909
Dark science.

241
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:34,324
What good does this useless
rubbish do us? Forget it!

242
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:35,926
You know something.

243
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:37,459
What do you know?

244
00:43:37,494 --> 00:43:40,622
I know enough, to leave their
ancient evil to moulder.

245
00:43:40,657 --> 00:43:43,100
Look what they've left us with.

246
00:43:43,135 --> 00:43:45,543
Leave it be I say.
But you...

247
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:47,302
always asking questions.

248
00:43:47,337 --> 00:43:50,924
So many pointless questions...
Probing, pushing.

249
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:54,636
Like, Two, he always
had to know, so much.

250
00:43:54,844 --> 00:43:57,639
I was right, you did
send him out to die.

251
00:43:57,674 --> 00:44:00,642
He was old, he was weak.

252
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:05,271
Sometimes one must be sacrificed
for the good of many.

253
00:44:05,306 --> 00:44:08,191
You, coward!

254
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:12,403
Seven.

255
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:30,421
Your path
takes us to catastrophe.

256
00:44:36,469 --> 00:44:40,494
- We have to go back.
- Back? Where?

257
00:44:40,529 --> 00:44:44,519
To the first room,
where I woke.

258
00:45:39,157 --> 00:45:42,577
Can't he see, his way
only brings trouble...

259
00:45:42,612 --> 00:45:45,455
I mean what good
comes from his part?

260
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:51,336
I know what we need, right now.
I know what's right.

261
00:45:51,371 --> 00:45:53,421
Huh?

262
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:55,924
No.

263
00:46:02,055 --> 00:46:03,640
Huh...

264
00:46:15,401 --> 00:46:18,571
No, no, you can't be.

265
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:21,282
No, no!

266
00:46:26,913 --> 00:46:28,915
Find them.

267
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:12,500
Don't look in the eyes.

268
00:47:23,553 --> 00:47:26,347
Five!

269
00:47:47,744 --> 00:47:50,580
- Seven!
- Nine!

270
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:15,271
- We have to go after them.
- What?

271
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:19,275
- Eight? Wher... where's, Eight?
- That thing has them.

272
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,986
It's taking them back
to the machine.

273
00:48:22,237 --> 00:48:24,572
Then it's too late.

274
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:26,762
Wait, wait,
we have to get outta here.

275
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:28,827
We must try to find
another safe place.

276
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:30,293
No more hiding.

277
00:48:30,328 --> 00:48:33,957
We're going after them!
All of us.

278
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,795
Need I remind you, on the outcome
of your last heroic venture?

279
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,019
I can't let this
happen to them.

280
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:22,982
- I'm going in.
- I'm coming with you.

281
00:50:23,024 --> 00:50:26,736
No... I need you here.

282
00:50:27,153 --> 00:50:29,906
If I don't make it back...

283
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:33,201
destroy it.

284
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:40,458
Wait, How?

285
00:50:50,218 --> 00:50:56,266
Come on, then. Let's hear it,
what's your... brilliant scheme?

286
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:00,562
We'll need a full barrel.

287
00:52:07,754 --> 00:52:11,090
Hey! Over here!

288
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:01,105
- Where are they?
- It's been too long.

289
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,436
- We have to do it now!
- No, they need more time.

290
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:12,610
Help me pull it down.

291
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:45,310
- They're coming. They're coming!
- Help.

292
00:53:45,345 --> 00:53:47,896
Help.

293
00:53:48,938 --> 00:53:52,066
No! Not yet.

294
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:56,779
- Let go, you fool.
- Five!

295
00:53:56,814 --> 00:53:58,907
We're coming!

296
00:53:58,942 --> 00:54:00,909
Now!

297
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:26,661
Good riddance.

298
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:30,415
It's done.

299
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:26,346
Thank you.

300
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:36,833
The machine, everybody!
The machine! It's still alive!

301
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:43,173
No!

302
00:57:44,257 --> 00:57:47,177
There's nothing we can do.

303
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:53,516
Help!

304
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:58,104
Please! No, no!

305
00:57:58,605 --> 00:58:01,024
No!

306
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,412
It's not.

307
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,000
To the bridge!

308
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:31,095
No! They're trapped!
They're trapped inside.

309
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:34,557
Six, come on!
Get on the bridge.

310
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:55,787
No, stop!
You mustn't destroy it.

311
00:58:55,822 --> 00:58:56,878
Get away, Six!

312
00:58:56,913 --> 00:58:59,123
You mustn't destroy it.
Don't destroy it.

313
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:01,288
They're trapped,
they're trapped!

314
00:59:01,323 --> 00:59:03,419
They're inside,
they're inside!

315
00:59:16,558 --> 00:59:18,434
Come on.

316
00:59:23,523 --> 00:59:27,235
Go back, to the first room!

317
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:30,947
He'll show you. The source.

318
00:59:49,465 --> 00:59:52,572
- It must be destroyed.
- No, no we can't.

319
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:55,680
Didn't you hear him?
They're trapped inside.

320
00:59:55,715 --> 00:59:58,325
- We can still save them.
- What?

321
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,935
- How?
- We have to find the source.

322
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:03,188
It holds the answers.

323
01:00:04,439 --> 01:00:08,234
- We need to destroy it.
- But there's still a chance.

324
01:00:12,197 --> 01:00:15,325
We're out of time.

325
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:17,083
Nine...

326
01:00:17,118 --> 01:00:19,704
they're gone.

327
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:22,916
You are wrong.

328
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:27,962
- Nine...
- Let him go.

329
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:33,368
Greetings, Nine.

330
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:37,664
It had such promise,
my great machine.

331
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:41,661
It was meant to be
an instrument of progress.

332
01:01:41,953 --> 01:01:43,920
of creation...

333
01:01:43,955 --> 01:01:49,210
that was the agreement our,
chancellor failed to honour.

334
01:01:49,878 --> 01:01:54,215
But the fault is hardly
his alone to bear.

335
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:58,970
The machine was born
purely of my intellect.

336
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:04,274
Which I now know,
was not enough.

337
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:09,939
My creation was hopelessly
flawed and indeed dangerous.

338
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:13,074
It lacked a human soul.

339
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:17,530
and could easily be corrupted
by those who controlled it.

340
01:02:17,565 --> 01:02:21,009
That is why,
I'm making each of you.

341
01:02:21,044 --> 01:02:25,773
You're all that's left,
of humanity.

342
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:30,502
You... are all the pieces
of my soul.

343
01:02:31,586 --> 01:02:37,133
Together, you and this device,
shall protect the future.

344
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:44,057
Look closely and remember...
what you see.

345
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:15,023
Fire!

346
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,484
No!

347
01:04:26,826 --> 01:04:29,746
I now know the truth!

348
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:32,380
The scientist.

349
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:36,044
It's the scientist.
He's the source.

350
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:38,546
He gave us his soul.

351
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:41,883
We are him.

352
01:04:46,888 --> 01:04:48,813
Load the cannon.

353
01:04:48,848 --> 01:04:52,101
Stop!
You'll destroy the talisman.

354
01:04:53,895 --> 01:04:56,314
It's too late.

355
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:35,353
Quick, quick get in.

356
01:05:37,772 --> 01:05:40,275
We need to take the talisman
above the machine.

357
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:43,118
It can be used against it.
lower it to me.

358
01:05:43,153 --> 01:05:47,073
- Then you'll have a chance.
- Enough, Nine, don't do this.

359
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:49,159
- What if you're wrong?
- I'll show you how to use it.

360
01:05:49,194 --> 01:05:51,744
It'll be okay.

361
01:05:54,247 --> 01:05:56,583
This is the sequence.

362
01:06:32,952 --> 01:06:35,044
No!

363
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:38,625
Please, we can't do this
without you.

364
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:42,260
They all died because of me.

365
01:06:42,295 --> 01:06:45,757
I started this,
and now I need to finish it.

366
01:06:48,718 --> 01:06:50,929
They left us nothing.

367
01:06:50,964 --> 01:06:52,639
Nothing.

368
01:06:53,056 --> 01:06:56,559
Why do we have to
right their wrongs?

369
01:06:56,726 --> 01:07:01,314
Sometimes,
one must be sacrificed.

370
01:07:03,566 --> 01:07:06,110
No!

371
01:08:13,887 --> 01:08:16,556
You did it.

372
01:08:17,682 --> 01:08:21,436
No... I didn't.

373
01:08:22,353 --> 01:08:24,105
Not yet.

374
01:08:36,242 --> 01:08:38,286
Photo log in.

375
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,742
They're free now.

376
01:11:51,813 --> 01:11:54,691
What happens next?

377
01:11:54,726 --> 01:11:57,534
I'm not sure, exactly.

378
01:11:57,569 --> 01:12:00,905
But this world is ours now.

379
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:04,075
It's what we make of it.

380
