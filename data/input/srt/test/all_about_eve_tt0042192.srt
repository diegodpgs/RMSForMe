00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,391
<i>(narrator) The Sarah Siddons Award</i>
<i>is perhaps unknown to you.</i>

2
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,278
<i>It has been spared the sensational publicity...</i>

3
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,636
<i>... of such questionable honours</i>
<i>as the Pulitzer Prize...</i>

4
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,396
<i>... and those awards presented annually</i>
<i>by that... film society.</i>

5
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,268
<i>The distinguished-looking gentleman</i>
<i>is an extremely old actor.</i>

6
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,636
<i>Being an actor,</i>
<i>he will go on speaking for some time.</i>

7
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,678
<i>It is not important that you hear what he says.</i>

8
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,878
<i>However, it is important that you know</i>
<i>where you are and why you are here.</i>

9
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,396
<i>This is the dining hall</i>
<i>of the Sarah Siddons Society.</i>

10
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,759
<i>It is the annual banquet and presentation</i>
<i>of the highest honour our theatre has:</i>

11
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,310
<i>the Sarah Siddons Award for</i>
<i>Distinguished Achievement.</i>

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,153
<i>These hallowed walls,</i>
<i>indeed many of these faces...</i>

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,233
<i>... have looked upon Modjeska,</i>
<i>Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske.</i>

14
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,437
<i>Mansfield's voice filled this room.</i>

15
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,195
<i>It is unlikely that the windows</i>
<i>have been opened since his death.</i>

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,911
<i>The minor awards, as you can see,</i>
<i>have already been presented.</i>

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,310
<i>Minor awards are for such</i>
<i>as the writer and director...</i>

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,994
<i>... since they merely construct a tower...</i>

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,834
<i>... so that the world can applaud</i>
<i>a light which flashes on top of it.</i>

20
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,118
<i>And no brighter light has ever</i>
<i>dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington.</i>

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,431
<i>Eve... but more of Eve later.</i>

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,556
<i>All about Eve, in fact.</i>

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,192
<i>To those who do not read, attend the theatre,</i>
<i>listen to unsponsored radio programmes...</i>

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,919
<i>... or know anything of the world</i>
<i>in which you live...</i>

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,231
<i>... it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself.</i>

26
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,390
<i>My name is Addison DeWitt.</i>

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,952
<i>My native habitat is the theatre.</i>
<i>In it, I toil not. Neither do I spin.</i>

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,429
<i>I am a critic and commentator.</i>

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,080
<i>I am essential to the theatre.</i>

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,151
<i>This is Karen Richards.</i>

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,552
<i>She is the wife of a playwright,</i>
<i>therefore of the theatre by marriage.</i>

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,795
<i>Nothing in her background should have</i>
<i>brought her closer to the stage than Row E.</i>

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,715
<i>However, during her senior year at Radcliffe,</i>
<i>Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama.</i>

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,759
<i>The following year</i>
<i>Karen became Mrs Lloyd Richards.</i>

35
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,389
<i>There are, in general,</i>
<i>two types of theatrical producers.</i>

36
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,792
<i>One has a great many wealthy friends</i>
<i>who will risk a tax-deductible loss.</i>

37
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,235
<i>This type is interested in art.</i>

38
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,518
<i>The other is one to whom each production</i>
<i>means potential ruin or fortune.</i>

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,591
<i>This type is out to make a buck.</i>

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,950
<i>Meet Max Fabian.</i>

41
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,831
<i>He is the producer of the play which has won</i>
<i>for Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award.</i>

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,195
<i>Margo Channing is a star of the theatre.</i>

43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,798
<i>She made her first stage appearance at</i>
<i>the age of four in Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

44
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,317
<i>She played a fairy and entered,</i>
<i>quite unexpectedly, stark naked.</i>

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,789
<i>She has been a star ever since.</i>

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,757
<i>Margo is a great star. A true star.</i>

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,674
<i>She never was or will be</i>
<i>anything less or anything else.</i>

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,712
<i>Having covered in tedious detail not only</i>
<i>the history of the Sarah Siddons Society...</i>

49
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,079
<i>... but also the history of acting since</i>
<i>Thespis first stepped out of the chorus line...</i>

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,312
<i>... our distinguished chairman has finally</i>
<i>arrived at our reason for being here.</i>

51
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,475
I have been proud and privileged
to have spent my life in the theatre...

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,315
<i>...a</i> poor player that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage...

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,798
<i>...and</i> I've been honoured to be, for 40 years...

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,634
...chief prompter
of the Sarah Siddons Society.

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,310
39 times have I placed in deserving hands...

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,870
<i>...this</i> highest honour the theatre knows.

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,758
Surely no actor is older than I.

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,308
I've earned my place - out of the sun.

59
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,799
<i>(laughter)</i>

60
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,477
And never before has this award gone to
anyone younger than its recipient tonight.

61
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,553
How fitting that it should
pass from my hands to hers.

62
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,236
Such young hands. Such a young lady.

63
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,031
Young in years, but whose heart
is as old as the theatre.

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,391
Some of us are privileged to know her.

65
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,677
We have seen beyond
the beauty and artistry...

66
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,877
<i>...that</i> have made her name
resound through the nation.

67
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,714
We know her humility, her devotion...

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,836
<i>...her</i> loyalty to her art...

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,311
<i>...her</i> love, her deep and abiding love for us...

70
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,916
<i>...for</i> what we are and what we do - the theatre.

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,669
She has had one wish...

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,354
<i>...one</i> prayer, one dream:

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,914
to belong to us.

74
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,435
Tonight her dream has come true...

75
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,229
<i>...and</i> henceforth
we shall dream the same of her.

76
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,836
Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguished
achievement in the theatre...

77
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,799
<i>...the</i> Sarah Siddons Award...
to Miss Eve Harrington.

78
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,911
Bravo!

79
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,234
<i>(Addison) Eve.</i>
<i>Eve, the golden girl. The cover girl.</i>

80
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,598
<i>The girl next door, the girl on the moon.</i>
<i>Time has been good to Eve.</i>

81
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,595
<i>Life goes where she goes. She's been</i>
<i>profiled, covered, revealed, reported...</i>

82
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,513
<i>... what she eats and what</i>
<i>she wears and whom she knows...</i>

83
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,637
<i>... and where she was and</i>
<i>when and where she's going.</i>

84
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,472
<i>Eve.</i>

85
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,949
<i>You all know all about Eve.</i>

86
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,639
<i>What can there be to know</i>
<i>that you don't know?</i>

87
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,279
<i>(Karen) When was it? How long?</i>

88
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,920
<i>It seems a lifetime ago.</i>

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,391
<i>Lloyd always said that in the theatre a lifetime</i>
<i>was a season and a season a lifetime.</i>

90
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,029
<i>It's June now. That was early October.</i>

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,991
<i>Only last October.</i>

92
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,635
<i>It was a drizzly night.</i>
<i>I remember I asked the taxi to wait.</i>

93
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,319
<i>Where was she?</i>

94
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,871
<i>Strange. I'd become so accustomed</i>
<i>to seeing her there night after night...</i>

95
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,997
<i>... I found myself looking for a girl</i>
<i>I'd never spoken to.</i>

96
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,469
<i>Wondering where she was.</i>

97
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,790
Mrs Richards?

98
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,149
There you are.

99
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,279
It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being here.

100
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,636
- Why should you think I wouldn't be?
- Why should you be?

101
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,236
Six nights a week for weeks of watching even
Margo Channing enter and leave a theatre.

102
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,914
- You don't mind my speaking to you?
- Not at all.

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,595
I've seen you so often.
It took every bit of courage I could raise.

104
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,148
To speak to just a playwright's wife?

105
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,595
I'm the lowest form of celebrity.

106
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,832
You're Margo Channing's best friend.
You and your husband are always with her.

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,549
And Mr Sampson. What's he like?

108
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,916
Bill Sampson? He's... he's a director.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,150
- He's the best.
- He'll agree with you.

110
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,109
Tell me. What do you do in between
the time Margo goes in and comes out?

111
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,589
Just huddle in that doorway and wait?

112
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,558
Oh, no. I see the play.

113
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,156
You see the play? You've seen
every performance of this play?

114
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,196
Yes.

115
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,796
But don't you find it, apart from
everything else, don't you find it expensive?

116
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,872
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.

117
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,990
- I'm gonna take you to Margo.
- Oh, no!

118
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,595
- Oh, yes! She's got to meet you.
- No, I'd be imposing on her.

119
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,671
I'd be just another tongue-tied fan.

120
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,832
There isn't another like you.
There couldn't be.

121
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,559
If I'd known... Some other time.
Looking like this!

122
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,076
You look just fine.
By the way, what's your name?

123
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,151
Eve. Eve Harrington.

124
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,677
- Good evening, Gus.
- Good evening, Mrs Richards.

125
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,431
- Good night.
- Good night, Gus.

126
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,269
You can breathe it, can't you?

127
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,869
Like some magic perfume.

128
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,751
<i>(laughter from behind the door)</i>

129
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,071
Wait right here. Don't run away.

130
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,391
"If the South had won,
you could write plays about the North."

131
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,710
- Hi.
- Hello!

132
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,473
"I don't think
you can rightly say we lost the war."

133
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,028
"We was more starved out, you might say."

134
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,954
"I don't understand all these plays
about love-starved Southern women."

135
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,510
"Love is one thing we were
never starved for in the South."

136
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,068
Margo's interview with
a reporter from the South.

137
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,311
When it gets printed,
they're gonna fire on Gettysburg again.

138
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,279
- It was Fort Sumter they fired on.
- I never played Fort Sumter.

139
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,673
Honeychild had a point.
Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts.

140
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,958
Write me one about a nice, normal woman
who just shoots her husband.

141
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,429
- You need new girdles.
- Buy some.

142
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,317
- Same size?
- Of course.

143
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,392
I find these wisecracks
increasingly less funny.

144
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,519
<i>- Aged in Wood</i> happens to be a fine play.
- That's my loyal little woman.

145
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,989
The critics thought so.
The audiences think so.

146
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,550
Packed houses,
tickets four months in advance.

147
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,108
I can't see that Lloyd's plays
have hurt you any.

148
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,079
- Easy now.
- Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth.

149
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,598
You get me so mad sometimes. Of all
the women with nothing to complain about...

150
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,750
- Ain't it the truth?
- Yes, it is.

151
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,195
You're talented, famous, wealthy.

152
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,319
People waiting around night after night
just to see you. Even in the rain.

153
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,599
Autograph fiends! They're not people. Little
beasts that run around in packs like coyotes.

154
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,433
- They're your fans.
- They're nobody's fans.

155
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,149
They're juvenile delinquents.
They're nobody's audience.

156
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,955
They never see a play or a movie.
They're never indoors long enough.

157
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,316
Well, there's one indoors right now.

158
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,714
- I've brought her back to see you.
- You've what?

159
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,549
She's just outside the door.

160
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,517
The heave-ho.

161
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,160
But you can't put her out! I promised!

162
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,836
Margo, you've got to see her. She worships
you. It's like something out of a book.

163
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,388
That book is out of print.
Those days are gone.

164
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,559
But if you'd only see her...
You're her whole life.

165
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,712
You must have spotted her by now.
She's always there.

166
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,271
Oh, the mousy one with
the trench coat and the funny hat.

167
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,318
How could I miss her?
Every night, every matinée.

168
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,711
Come in, Eve.

169
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
- I thought you'd forgotten about me.
- Not at all.

170
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,590
Margo, this is Eve Harrington.

171
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,069
- How do you do, my dear?
- Oh, brother!

172
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,037
- Hello, Miss Channing.
- My husband.

173
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,156
- Hello, Miss Harrington.
- How do you do?

174
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,312
And this is my dear friend
and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

175
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,550
- Oh, brother!
- Miss Coonan.

176
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,200
- Oh, brother, what?
- When she gets like this...

177
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,396
<i>...she</i> starts playing Hamlet's mother.

178
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,109
I'm sure you must have things
to do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear.

179
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,556
If I haven't, I'll find
something till you get normal.

180
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,560
Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?

181
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,709
Harrington.

182
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,395
- I'm so sorry. Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

183
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,474
- Would you like a drink?
- I was saying how often you've seen the play.

184
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,039
No, thank you.

185
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,917
Yes, I've seen every performance.

186
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,152
Every performance?
Then am I safe in assuming you like it?

187
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,076
- I'd like anything Miss Channing played in.
- Would you really? How sweet!

188
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,197
I doubt very much that
you'd like her in <i>The Hairy Ape.</i>

189
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,999
Please don't misunderstand me, Mr Richards.

190
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,631
I think part of Miss Channing's greatness
lies in her ability to pick the best plays.

191
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,713
- Your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it?
- Of course it is.

192
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,315
- How did you hear about it?
- There was an item in <i>The Times.</i>

193
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,073
I like the title, <i>Footsteps on the Ceiling.</i>

194
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,116
Yes, but let's get back to this one.

195
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,272
- Have you really seen every performance?
- Yes.

196
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,316
Why? I'm curious.

197
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,679
Well, if I didn't come to see the play,
I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.

198
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,311
- There are other plays.
- Not with you in them. Not by Mr Richards.

199
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,676
But you must have friends, a home, family?

200
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,269
Tell us about it, Eve.

201
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,357
- If I only knew how.
- Try.

202
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,990
- Well...
<i>- (door opens)</i>

203
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,592
Well, it started with the play before this one.

204
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,910
<i>- Remembrance.</i>
<i>- Remembrance.</i>

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,878
- Did you see it here in New York?
- San Francisco.

206
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,312
It was the last week. I went one night.

207
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,358
The most important night
of my life... until now.

208
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,399
I found myself going the next night
and the next and the next.

209
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,630
Every performance.

210
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,349
Then, when the show went East, I went East.

211
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,231
- Eve, why don't you start at the beginning?
- Oh, it couldn't possibly interest you.

212
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,551
Please.

213
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,199
I guess it started back home.
Wisconsin, that is.

214
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,555
It was just Mom and Dad and me.

215
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,792
I was an only child.
I used to make believe a lot when I was a kid.

216
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,714
Acted out all sorts of things.
What they were isn't important.

217
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,635
But, somehow, acting and make-believe
began to fill up my life more and more.

218
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,312
It got so I couldn't tell
the real from the unreal.

219
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,597
Except that the unreal
seemed more real to me...

220
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,509
- I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
- Not at all.

221
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,951
Farmers were poor in those days.
That's what Dad was, a farmer.

222
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,076
I had to help out.

223
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,510
So I quit school, went to Milwaukee,
became a secretary... in a brewery.

224
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,674
When you're a secretary in a brewery, it's
hard to make believe you're anything else.

225
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,637
Everything is beer.

226
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,474
It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home.

227
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,633
And there was a little theatre group there,
like a drop of rain on the desert.

228
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,711
That's where I met Eddie.

229
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,598
He was a radio technician.

230
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,274
We played <i>Liliom</i> for three performances.

231
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,789
I was awful.

232
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,316
Then the war came and we got married.

233
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,391
Eddie was in the air force.

234
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,869
They sent him to the South Pacific.

235
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,789
You were with the OWI, weren't you,
Mr Richards? That's what <i>Who's Who</i> says.

236
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,558
Well, with Eddie gone,
my life went back to beer.

237
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,790
Except for a letter a week.

238
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,031
One week he wrote me
he had leave coming up.

239
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,194
I'd saved my money and vacation time
and went to San Francisco to meet him.

240
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,994
But Eddie wasn't there.

241
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,878
They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee.

242
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,394
The one that came from Washington.

243
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,278
To say that... Eddie wasn't coming at all.

244
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,154
That Eddie was dead.

245
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,388
I figured I'd stay in San Francisco.

246
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,756
I was alone. I couldn't go back without Eddie.

247
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,548
I found a job, and his insurance helped.

248
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,032
And there were theatres in San Francisco.

249
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,591
And then, one night, Margo Channing
came to play in <i>Remembrance...</i>

250
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,671
<i>...and</i> I went to see it.

251
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,717
Well...

252
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,836
Here I am.

253
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,591
What a story. Everything but
the bloodhounds snapping at her rear end.

254
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,232
There are some human experiences that
do not take place in a vaudeville house!

255
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,438
And that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian
should understand and respect.

256
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,030
- I want to apologise for Birdie.
- You don't have to apologise for me!

257
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,790
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
It's just my way of talking.

258
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,394
You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan.

259
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,471
Call me Birdie.

260
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,390
And as for being fifth-rate...

261
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,519
<i>...I</i> closed the first half
for eleven years, and you know it!

262
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,638
47 minutes from now my plane takes off
and how do I find you?

263
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,553
- Not ready, looking like a junkyard!
- Thank you so much!

264
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,871
Is it sabotage?
Have you no human consideration?

265
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,635
- Show me a human and I might have.
- Airlines have clocks, even if you don't.

266
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,871
I start shooting a week from Monday.
Zanuck is impatient.

267
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,996
Zanuck, Zanuck! What are you two? Lovers?

268
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,833
- Only in some ways. You're prettier.
- I'm a junkyard.

269
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,071
- Bill! This is Eve Harrington.
- Hi.

270
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,551
My wonderful junkyard. The mystery
and dreams you find in a junkyard.

271
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,437
Heaven help me.

272
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,511
I love a psychotic.

273
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,988
- Hello. What's your name?
- Eve Harrington.

274
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,548
- You've already met.
- Huh? Where?

275
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,599
- Right here, just a minute ago.
- That's nice.

276
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,599
- You're not going, are you?
- I think I'd better.

277
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,117
It's been... I can hardly find
the words to say how it's been.

278
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,111
No, don't go.

279
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,990
The four of you must have so much to say
to each other with Mr Sampson leaving.

280
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,235
No, stick around, please.

281
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,314
Tell you what. We'll put Stanislavsky
on his plane, then go somewhere and talk.

282
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,073
Well, if I'm not in the way...

283
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,151
I won't be a minute.

284
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,031
Lloyd, we've got to go!

285
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,712
Good night, Margo!

286
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,598
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Not too early!

287
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,469
- Good luck, genius.
- Geniuses don't need good luck. I do.

288
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,075
- I'm not worried about you.
- Keep the thought.

289
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,272
Good night, Eve.
I hope I see you again soon.

290
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,150
- I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinée.
- Not just that way. As a friend.

291
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,231
I'd like that.

292
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,799
- It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
- I hope so, Mr Richards. Good night.

293
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,155
Good night.

294
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,037
Mrs Richards?

295
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,959
I'll never forget this night as long as I live.

296
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,271
And I'll never forget <i>you</i>
for making it possible.

297
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,238
<i>(Karen) And I'll never forget you, Eve.</i>

298
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,437
<i>Where were we going that night, Lloyd and I?</i>

299
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,954
<i>Funny, the things you remember...</i>

300
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,031
<i>... and the things you don't.</i>

301
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,914
- So you're going to Hollywood?
- Mm-hm.

302
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,958
- Why?
- I just wondered.

303
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,918
- Just wondered what?
- Why?

304
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,956
- Why what?
- Why you have to go out... there.

305
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,435
- I don't have to. I want to.
- Is it the money?

306
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,476
80% of it'll go for taxes.

307
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,157
Then why? Why, if you're the most
successful young director in the theatre...

308
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,709
The theatre! The theatre!

309
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,315
What rules say the theatre exists
only within some ugly buildings...

310
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,073
...crowded into one
square mile of New York City?

311
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,151
Or London, Paris or Vienna?

312
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,588
Listen, Junior, and learn.

313
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,390
Do you wanna know what the theatre is?
A flea circus. Also opera.

314
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,074
Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets...

315
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,278
...Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy,
a one-man band - all theatre.

316
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,150
Wherever there's magic and make-believe
and an audience, there's theatre.

317
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,158
Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger.

318
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,358
Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford.
Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable.

319
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,432
Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse -
all theatre.

320
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,838
You don't understand them all.
You don't like them all.

321
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,835
Why should you? The theatre's for everybody
- you included - but not exclusively.

322
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,480
So, don't approve or disapprove.

323
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,235
It may not be your theatre,
but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere.

324
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,709
I just asked a simple question.

325
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,359
And I shot my mouth off.

326
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,398
Nothing personal, Junior. No offence.

327
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,634
It's just that there's so much bushwa in
this ivory greenroom they call the theatre...

328
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,029
...sometimes it gets up around my chin.

329
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,398
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay out there.

330
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,992
- It's only a one-picture deal.
- So few come back.

331
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,712
I read George Jean Nathan every week.

332
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,076
- Also Addison DeWitt.
- Every day.

333
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,472
- You didn't have to tell me.
<i>- (door opens)</i>

334
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,551
It's the latest thing - one earring.

335
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,474
If it isn't, it's going to be.
I can't find the other one.

336
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,994
Throw that dreary letter away. It bores me.

337
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,878
- Where do you suppose it could be?
- It'll show up.

338
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,316
Oh, I give up. Look in the wigs.
Maybe it got caught in one.

339
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,119
Real diamonds in a wig! The world we live in!

340
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,998
- Where's my coat?
- Right where you left it.

341
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,111
The seams.

342
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,438
He can't take his eyes off my legs.

343
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,511
Like a nylon lemon peel.

344
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,637
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously.

345
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,711
Here we go.

346
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,189
Got any messages?
What do you want me to tell Tyrone Power?

347
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,477
Just give him my phone number.
I'll tell him myself.

348
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,111
Kill the people.

349
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,229
- You got your key?
- See you at home.

350
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,715
I have a suggestion.
There's really not very much time left.

351
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,394
I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet.

352
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,712
And I could take care of everything here
and meet you at the gate with the ticket...

353
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,756
<i>...if</i> you'd like.

354
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,637
I think we'd like very much.

355
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,109
- Sure you won't mind?
- Of course not.

356
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,599
- She's quite a girl, this whatshername.
- Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way.

357
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,593
That lack of pretence,
that strange directness and understanding.

358
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,240
Did she tell you about
the theatre and what it meant?

359
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,629
No, I told her. I sounded off.

360
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,553
All the religions in the world rolled into <i>one,...</i>

361
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,995
<i>...and</i> we're gods and goddesses.

362
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,551
Isn't it silly? Suddenly I've developed
a big, protective feeling toward her.

363
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,234
A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle.

364
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,678
- Take care of yourself out there.
- They have the Indians pretty well in hand.

365
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,958
- Bill, don't get stuck on some glamour puss.
- I'll try.

366
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,635
You're not much of a bargain. You're
conceited, thoughtless and messy.

367
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,714
- Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
- You're a setup for some young babe.

368
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,234
How childish are you gonna get
before you stop it?

369
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,914
I don't wanna be childish.
I'd settle for a few years.

370
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,070
And cut that out right now.

371
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,118
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

372
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,555
As of this moment, you're six years old.

373
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,234
All ready.

374
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,590
Thanks for your help. Good luck.

375
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,750
Goodbye, Mr Sampson.

376
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,638
- Knit me a muffler?
- Call me when you get in.

377
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,750
<i>(Bill)</i> Hey, Junior!

378
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,069
Keep your eye on her. Don't let her get lonely.
She's a loose lamb in a jungle.

379
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,151
Don't worry.

380
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,916
<i>(Margo) That same night, we sent for Eve's</i>
<i>things... her few pitiful possessions.</i>

381
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,356
<i>She moved into the little guest room</i>
<i>on the top floor.</i>

382
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,309
<i>The next three weeks were out of a fairy tale,</i>
<i>and I was Cinderella in the last act.</i>

383
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,872
<i>Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother,</i>
<i>friend, psychiatrist and cop.</i>

384
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,516
<i>The honeymoon was on.</i>

385
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,194
<i>(inaudible)</i>

386
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,311
<i>(applause)</i>

387
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,391
<i>(cheering)</i>

388
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,435
One more?

389
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,511
From now on it isn't applause -

390
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,797
just something to do
till the aisles get cleared.

391
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,551
What, again?

392
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,552
I could watch you play that last scene
a thousand times, cry every time.

393
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,316
Performance number 1,000 of this one,
if I play it that long...

394
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,597
<i>...will</i> take place
in a well-padded booby hatch.

395
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,358
I must say, you can certainly tell
Mr Sampson's been gone a month.

396
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,476
You certainly can.

397
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,235
Especially if you're me
between now and tomorrow morning.

398
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,437
You bought the new girdles a size smaller.
I can feel it.

399
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,909
Something maybe grew a size larger.

400
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,310
You can get into one of those girdles
and act for two and a half hours.

401
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,870
I couldn't get into the girdle
in two and a half hours!

402
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,870
You haven't noticed my latest bit
of interior decorating.

403
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,555
<i>(Margo)</i> But you've done so much!
What's new?

404
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,029
The curtains. I made them myself.

405
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,793
They're lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?

406
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,233
Adorable.

407
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,313
We now got everything a dressing room
needs except a basketball hoop!

408
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,630
Just because you can't even work a zipper!

409
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,996
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I appreciate it.

410
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,753
I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress.

411
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,992
- Don't bother. Mrs Brown will be along soon.
- No trouble at all.

412
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,154
May I be so bold as to say something?

413
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,835
- Have you ever heard of the word "union"?
- Behind in your dues? How much?

414
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,230
- I haven't got a union. I'm slave labour.
- Well?

415
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,312
But the wardrobe women have got one
and, next to a tenor...

416
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,836
<i>...a</i> wardrobe woman is the
touchiest thing in show business.

417
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,909
Oh, oh.

418
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,231
She's got two things to do:
carry clothes and press 'em wrong.

419
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,437
And don't let anybody try to muscle in.

420
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,915
Eve.

421
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,797
We'd better let Mrs Brown
pick up the wardrobe.

422
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,911
<i>(phone rings)</i>

423
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,237
- Hello.
<i>- We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills.</i>

424
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,348
- Call? What call?
<i>- Is this Templeton 89970? Miss Channing?</i>

425
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,590
Yes, it is, but I don't understand.

426
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,549
<i>We are ready with the call you placed for</i>
<i>12 midnight, California time, to Mr Sampson.</i>

427
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,393
- I placed?
<i>- Go ahead, please.</i>

428
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,916
<i>(Bill) Margo, what a wonderful surprise!</i>

429
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,151
<i>What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do!</i>

430
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,710
Bill! Have I gone crazy, Bill?

431
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,314
<i>- You're my girl, aren't you?</i>
- That I am.

432
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,391
<i>Then you're crazy.</i>

433
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,553
- When are you coming back?
<i>- I leave in a week.</i>

434
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,313
<i>The picture's wrapped up.</i>
<i>We previewed last night.</i>

435
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,556
Oh, those previews!

436
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,553
Like opening out of town, but terrifying.
There's nothing you can do.

437
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,676
You're trapped. You're in a tin can.

438
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,188
In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped
in a Navajo blanket, I want you home.

439
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,918
- You in a hurry?
- In a big hurry, so be quick about it.

440
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,830
Goodbye, darling. Sleep tight.

441
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,718
Hey, wait a minute!
You haven't even said it yet!

442
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,557
Oh, now, Bill. You know how much I do,
but over a phone...

443
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,632
Now, really. That's kids' stuff.

444
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,315
Kids' stuff or not. It doesn't happen
every day and I wanna hear it!

445
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,358
- And if you won't say it, you can sing it.
- Sing it?!

446
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,238
<i>Sure, like the Western Union boys used to do.</i>

447
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,236
Bill...

448
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,149
It's your birthday.

449
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,189
<i>And who remembered it?</i>
<i>Who was there on the dot at 12 midnight?</i>

450
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,157
Happy birthday, darling.

451
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,471
The reading could've been better,
but you said it.

452
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,710
Now "many happy returns of the day".

453
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,598
Many happy returns of the day.

454
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,519
<i>- I get a party, don't I?</i>
- Of course. Birthday and coming home.

455
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,309
- Who will I ask?
- I know all about the party. Eve wrote me.

456
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,834
- She did?
<i>- She hasn't missed a week since I left.</i>

457
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,514
<i>But you know that.</i>
<i>You probably tell her what to write.</i>

458
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,878
- I sent her a list of guests, so check with her.
- Yeah, I will.

459
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,396
<i>- How is Eve? OK?</i>
- OK.

460
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,074
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I'll check with Eve.

461
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,718
<i>Hm?</i>

462
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,429
I love you too. Good night, darling.

463
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,791
See ya.

464
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,951
- Birdie.
- Hm?

465
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,149
You don't like Eve, do you?

466
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,435
You want an argument or an answer?

467
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,034
- An answer.
- No.

468
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,509
- Why not?
- Now you want an argument.

469
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,597
- She works hard.
- Night and day.

470
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,878
- She's loyal and efficient.
- Like an agent with only one client.

471
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,074
She thinks only of me...

472
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,831
...doesn't she?

473
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,276
Well, let's say she thinks
only <i>about</i> ya, anyway.

474
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,238
- How do you mean that?
- I'll tell ya how.

475
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,758
Like...

476
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,751
Like she's studying you.

477
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,912
Like you was a play, or a book,
or a set of blueprints.

478
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,116
How you walk, talk, eat, think...

479
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,237
I'm sure that's flattering.
There's nothing wrong with it.

480
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,912
<i>(knock on door)</i>

481
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,599
Good morning. Well, what do
you think of my elegant new suit?

482
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,989
It looks much better on you than it did on me.

483
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,676
I can imagine. All it needed was
a little taking in here and letting out there.

484
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,709
- Are you sure you won't want it yourself?
- Quite sure. I find it too <i>seventeenish</i> for me.

485
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,030
Come now, as though you were an old lady!

486
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,509
I'm on my way. Is there anything else?

487
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,909
- That script to take to the Guild.
- I've got it.

488
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,434
And those cheques for the income-tax man.

489
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,511
Right here.

490
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,197
It seems I can't think of a thing
you haven't thought of.

491
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,874
That's my job. See you at teatime.

492
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,713
Eve?

493
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,193
Did you place a call from me to Bill
for midnight California time?

494
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,316
- Golly, I forgot to tell you!
- Yes, dear, you forgot all about it.

495
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,119
I was sure you'd want to, being his birthday.

496
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,830
You've been so busy lately. Last night
I meant to tell you before you went out.

497
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,388
I guess I was asleep when you got home.

498
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,677
Yes, I guess you were.
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.

499
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,750
Mr Sampson's birthday, I couldn't forget that.
You'd never forgive me.

500
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,670
As a matter of fact,
I sent him a telegram myself.

501
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,877
<i>(Margo) Bill's welcome-home birthday party...</i>
<i>a night to go down in history.</i>

502
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,397
<i>Even before the party started,</i>
<i>I could smell disaster in the air.</i>

503
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,918
<i>I knew it. I sensed it even as I finished</i>
<i>dressing for that blasted party.</i>

504
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,834
- You all put together?
- My back's open.

505
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,754
- Extra help get here?
- There's some characters...

506
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,549
...dressed as maids and butlers.
Did you call the William Morris Agency?

507
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,791
You're not funny. Actors would cost less!
How about the food?

508
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,394
The caterer had to go back
for the hors d'oeuvres.

509
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,311
<i>Voilà!</i>

510
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,153
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot.

511
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,993
There was nothing he didn't know.

512
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,751
There's a message from the bartender.

513
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,355
"Does Miss Channing know that
she ordered domestic gin by mistake?"

514
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,113
The only thing I ordered
by mistake is the guests.

515
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,078
They don't care what they drink
as long as it burns.

516
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,958
- Where's Bill? He's late.
- Late for what?

517
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,158
- Don't be dense. The party.
- I ain't dense. He's been here for 20 minutes.

518
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,028
Well, I certainly think it's odd
he hasn't even come up to...

519
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,475
<i>- (laughter)</i>
- The cameraman said:

520
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,599
"Even De Mille couldn't see anything
looking through the wrong end!" So...

521
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,638
Don't let me kill the point.
Or isn't it a story for grown-ups?

522
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,792
You've heard it. I looked through
the wrong end of the camera.

523
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,839
Remind me to tell you about the time
I looked into the heart of an artichoke.

524
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,198
- I'd like to hear it.
- Some snowy night in front of the fire.

525
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,272
Meanwhile, would you check
about the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?

526
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,511
The caterer forgot them.
The varnish wasn't dry or something.

527
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,591
Of course.

528
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,110
Looks like I'm going
to have a fancy party.

529
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,875
- I thought you were going to be late.
- Well, I'm guest of honour!

530
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,916
I had no idea you were even here.

531
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,037
I ran into Eve
and she told me you were dressing.

532
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,509
That's never stopped you before.

533
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,390
She wanted to know about Hollywood.
She seemed so interested...

534
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,393
- She's a girl of so many interests.
- It's a pretty rare quality these days.

535
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,790
- A girl of so many <i>rare</i> qualities.
- So she seems.

536
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,075
So you've pointed out so often!

537
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,116
So many qualities so often!

538
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,318
Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth
and affection, and so young!

539
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,391
So young and so fair.

540
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,435
I can't believe you're making this up.

541
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,512
It sounds like something
out of an old Clyde Fitch play.

542
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,309
Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so,
was well before my time!

543
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,518
I always deny that you were in <i>Our American</i>
<i>Cousin</i> the night Lincoln was shot.

544
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,478
- I don't think that's funny.
- Of course it is!

545
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,028
This is all too laughable to be anything else!

546
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,475
You know what I feel
about your age obsession.

547
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,156
And this getting into a jealous froth because
I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid.

548
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,549
- 20!
- 30 minutes, 40 minutes. What of it?

549
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,029
Stage-struck! She's a young lady of qualities.

550
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,954
And I'm fed up with both
the young lady and her qualities!

551
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,316
Studying me as if I were a play or a blueprint!

552
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,278
How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep!

553
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,069
How can you take offence at a kid
trying to be like her ideal?

554
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,549
Stop calling her a kid!

555
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,676
As it happens, there are
particular aspects of my life...

556
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,799
<i>...to</i> which I would like to maintain
sole and exclusive rights and privileges.

557
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,992
- For instance, what?
- For instance, you.

558
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,915
This is my cue to take you
in my arms and reassure you.

559
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,797
But I'm not going to. I'm too mad.

560
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,359
- Guilty!
- Mad!

561
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,479
There are certain characteristics
for which you are famous, on stage and off.

562
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,838
I love you for some and in spite of others.
I haven't let those become too important.

563
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,391
They're part of your equipment for getting
along in what is called "our environment".

564
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,948
You have to keep your teeth sharp, all right.

565
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,873
But I will not have you
sharpen them on me, or on Eve.

566
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,317
- What about her teeth? Her fangs?
- She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!

567
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,392
So when you start judging
an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid...

568
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,474
<i>...by</i> the bar-room, Benzedrine standards of
this megalomaniac society, I won't have it!

569
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,996
Eve Harrington has never by word, look,
thought or suggestion...

570
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,471
...indicated anything to me but adoration
for you and happiness at our being in love!

571
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,270
To intimate anything else spells a paranoiac
insecurity that you should be ashamed of!

572
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,150
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel?
Do I get dragged off to the snake pits?

573
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,231
<i>(Eve)</i> Miss Channing?

574
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,314
The hors d'oeuvres are here.
Is there anything else I can do?

575
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,475
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.

576
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,551
I'll get it.

577
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,916
- What'll you have?
- A milk shake?

578
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,389
A martini, very dry, please.

579
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,471
<i>(laughter and chatter)</i>

580
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,398
- The party's on the first floor.
- Hi, Bill.

581
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,755
- Hello, Mrs Richards.
- How are you, dear?

582
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,559
Good evening, Mr Richards. Mr Fabian.

583
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,870
- May I have your coat?
- I'll take it up.

584
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,951
- Please.
- Thank you.

585
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,471
- Hi.
- Hi, Margo!

586
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,952
- The house looks lovely.
- I like that girl.

587
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,076
That quality of quiet graciousness.

588
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,879
Among so many quiet qualities.

589
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,791
Shall we?

590
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,870
- It's made me so happy your taking Eve in.
- I'm so happy you're happy.

591
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,875
You haven't been running a settlement house
exactly. The kid has earned her way.

592
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,554
You had a mixed-up inventory
when she took over.

593
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,835
Merchandise laying all over the shop.

594
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,674
- You mixed Margo up with a five-and-ten.
- Make it Bergdorf Goodman.

595
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,469
Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max?
All done up in little ribbons.

596
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,393
I could die right now
and nobody'd be confused.

597
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,675
- How about you, Max?
- How about me what?

598
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,752
Suppose you dropped dead.
What about your inventory?

599
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,913
I ain't going to drop dead. Not with the heat.

600
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,673
This is the most ghoulish conversation!

601
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,796
- Thank you.
- Nothing.

602
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,791
Max! <i>Mon vieux!</i>

603
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,189
Fife!

604
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,558
"The kid" will be down in a minute, unless
you'd like to take her drink up to her.

605
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,269
I can get a fresh one...
Karen, you're a Gibson girl.

606
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,074
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish.

607
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,152
- What has or is about to happen?
- What <i>is</i> he talking about?

608
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,550
- Macbeth.
- We've seen you like this before.

609
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,029
Is it over or is it just beginning?

610
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,279
Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a bumpy night.

611
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,315
- Margo, darling!
- How are you?

612
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,073
<i>Mademoiselle, je vous remercie</i>
<i>pour l'invitation.</i>

613
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,277
<i>Enchantée</i> to you too.

614
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,548
I remember, Addison, crossing you off
my guest list. What are you doing here?

615
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,792
Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable
Peter Pan. You must play it again soon.

616
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,314
- Remember Miss Caswell?
- I do not. How do you do?

617
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,437
- We've never met. Maybe that's why.
- She is an actress.

618
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,717
A graduate of the Copacabana
School of Dramatic Art.

619
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,996
Ah... Eve.

620
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,311
- Good evening, Mr DeWitt.
- I had no idea you knew each other.

621
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,073
This must be, at long last,
our formal introduction.

622
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,790
- Until now, we've only met in passing.
- That's how you met me. In passing.

623
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,235
Eve, this is an old friend
of Mr DeWitt's mother(!)

624
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,630
- Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington.
- How do you do?

625
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,473
I've been wanting you
to meet Eve for the longest time.

626
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,518
Your timidity must have
kept you from mentioning it.

627
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,876
- You know of her interest in the theatre?
- We have that in common.

628
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,791
Then you two must have a long talk.

629
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,792
I'm afraid Mr DeWitt would find me
boring before too long.

630
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,236
You won't bore him, honey.
You won't even get a chance to talk.

631
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,311
Claudia, come here.

632
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,078
You see that man?
That's Max Fabian, the producer.

633
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,390
Now, go and do yourself some good.

634
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,119
Why do they always look
like unhappy rabbits?

635
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,795
Cos that's what they are.
Now go and make him happier.

636
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,598
Now, don't worry about your little charge.
She'll be in safe hands.

637
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,951
Amen!

638
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,151
<i>("Liebestraum" by Liszt)</i>

639
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,711
<i>(changes to a jaunty tune)</i>

640
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,230
<i>- Liebestraum.</i>
- I just played it.

641
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,471
- Play it again.
- But that was the fourth straight time.

642
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,710
Then this will be five.

643
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,797
Many of your guests are wondering when
they may be permitted to view the body.

644
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,953
- Where has it been laid out?
- It hasn't been laid out.

645
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,157
We haven't finished with the embalming.

646
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,118
As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.

647
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,919
The remains of Margo Channing...

648
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,791
...sitting up.

649
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,236
It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.

650
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,709
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?

651
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,998
You know nothing about feelings,
natural or unnatural.

652
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,550
Your guests were also wondering
whether the music couldn't be...

653
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,837
<i>...a</i> shade more on the...
shall we say, happier side?

654
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,313
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest
they accompany you to the nursery...

655
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,075
...where I'm sure you will
all feel more at home.

656
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,915
Margo, you by any chance haven't got
any bicarbonate of soda in the house?

657
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,197
Poor Max! Heartburn?

658
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,555
It's that Miss Caswell.

659
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,677
I don't see why she hasn't
given Addison heartburn.

660
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,198
- No heart to burn.
- Everybody has a heart, except some people.

661
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,390
Of course I've got bicarb.

662
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,869
I've got a box in the pantry.

663
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,396
We'll put your name on it. "Max Fabian."

664
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,712
It will stay there always, just for you.

665
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,036
Let the rest of the world
beat their brains out for a buck.

666
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,156
It's friends that count.

667
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,870
- And I have friends.
- I love you, Max. I really mean it.

668
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,110
I love you.

669
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,395
Come to the pantry.

670
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,032
She loves me like a father. Also, she's loaded.

671
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,991
There you are, Maxie dear.

672
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,072
One good burp
and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell.

673
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,596
The situation I'm in ain't the kind
you can belch your way out of.

674
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,956
- I made a promise.
- To Miss Caswell? What?

675
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,634
For an audition for this part we are replacing.

676
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,676
What's her name? Your sister?

677
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,035
- One?
- No, two, please.

678
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,350
If she can act, she might not be bad.

679
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,432
She looks like she might
burn down a plantation.

680
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,239
Right now, I feel like
there is one burning in me.

681
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,153
- When's the audition?
- A couple of weeks.

682
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,789
Tell you what. Why don't I read with her?

683
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,475
- Would you?
- Anything to help you out, Max.

684
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,472
Now that's cooperation. I appreciate it.

685
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,189
Not at all. And now you
can do me a great favour.

686
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,316
Just name it.

687
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,597
Give Eve Harrington a job in your office.

688
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,590
<i>- (belches)</i>
- You get quick action, don't you?

689
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,478
I wouldn't think of taking
that girl away from you.

690
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,111
You said yourself my inventory was in shape,
all my merchandise put away.

691
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,636
To keep her here with nothing to do,
I'd be standing in her way.

692
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,518
- And you need her, Max.
- What will she do?

693
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,319
She'd be a great help. She'd read scripts...

694
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,712
...interview people you have to see,
get rid of those you don't have to.

695
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,268
You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie.

696
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,635
- Well...
- Think of your health.

697
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,110
More time to relax
in the fresh air at a racetrack.

698
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,636
- I don't think it's such a good idea.
- Promise?

699
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,711
- Promise.
- That's my Max.

700
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,078
Oh, there you both are.

701
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,276
Max, Karen's decided it's time to go.

702
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,874
- Where is she now?
- Up in your room.

703
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,157
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go and tell Miss Caswell.

704
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,229
- Who's left out there?
- Too many.

705
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,676
And, besides, you got a new guest.
A movie star from Hollywood.

706
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,276
Shucks! And I sent
my autograph book to the cleaners.

707
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,873
You disapprove of me
when I'm like this, don't you?

708
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,431
Not exactly. Sometimes, though,
I wish I understood you better.

709
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,909
- When you do, let me in on it.
- I will.

710
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,992
- How's the new one coming?
- The play? Oh, all right, I guess.

711
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,236
Cora. Still a girl of 20?

712
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,311
20-ish. It's not important.

713
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,073
Don't you think it's about time
it became important?

714
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,197
- How do you mean?
- Don't be evasive.

715
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,635
Margo, you haven't got any age.

716
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,235
Miss Channing is ageless.
Spoken like a press agent.

717
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,039
I know what I'm talking about.
They're my plays.

718
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,111
Spoken like an author.

719
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,151
Lloyd, I'm not 20-ish. I'm not 30-ish.

720
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,959
Three months ago I was 40 years old.

721
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,508
40! Four-0.

722
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,870
That slipped out.
I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it.

723
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,314
Now I suddenly feel as if
I've taken all my clothes off.

724
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,073
To thousands of people
you're as young as you want.

725
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,799
As young as <i>they</i> want, you mean.

726
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,589
I'm not interested whether thousands
of people think I'm six or 600!

727
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,069
Just one person, isn't that so?

728
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,556
You know what this is all about. It has little
to do with whether you should play Cora.

729
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,632
It has everything to do with
you having a fight with Bill.

730
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,678
Bill's 32. He looks 32.

731
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,072
He looked it five years ago.
He'll look it 20 years from now.

732
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,151
I hate men!

733
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,439
Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your play.

734
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,638
I'll wear rompers and come in
rolling a hoop, if you like.

735
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,955
Who'd show up at this hour?
It's time people went home.

736
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,151
Hold that coat up.

737
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,958
<i>(wolf-whistles)</i>

738
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,237
- Whose is it?
- Some Hollywood movie star.

739
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,551
- Her plane got in late.
- Discouraging, isn't it?

740
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,871
Women with furs like that
where it never even gets cold.

741
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,951
Hollywood.

742
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,796
Tell me, Eve. How are things
going with you? Happy?

743
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,030
There should be a new word for happiness.

744
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,715
Being here with Miss Channing
has been a... I just can't say.

745
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,110
She's been so wonderful,
done so much for me.

746
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,952
Lloyd says Margo compensates for
underplaying on stage by overplaying reality.

747
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,794
Next to that sable, my new mink
seems like an old bed jacket.

748
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,079
You've done your share, Eve. You've
worked wonders with Margo. Good night.

749
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,879
- Mrs Richards?
- Karen.

750
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,837
Karen.

751
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,390
Isn't it awful? I'm about
to ask you for another favour...

752
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,391
...after all you've done already.

753
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,311
Nobody's done so much.

754
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,915
Stop thinking of yourself
as one of the hundred neediest cases.

755
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,959
- What is it?
- Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape...

756
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,032
<i>...so</i> there isn't enough
to keep me as busy as I should be.

757
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,317
Not that I'd consider anything
that would take me away from her.

758
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,836
But the other day
when Mr Fabian told Miss Channing...

759
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,277
<i>...that</i> her understudy was going to have
a baby and they'd have to replace her...

760
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,911
- You wanna be Margo's new understudy?
- I don't let myself think about it even.

761
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,436
But I do know the part so well,
and every bit of the staging...

762
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,318
...there'd be no need to break in a new girl.

763
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,994
Suppose I had to go on one night...

764
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,231
<i>...to</i> an audience that came
to see Margo Channing.

765
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,710
- Oh no, I couldn't possibly!
- I wouldn't worry too much about that.

766
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:17,193
Margo just doesn't miss performances.
If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays.

767
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,592
- The show must go on.
- No, dear. Margo must go on.

768
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,717
I don't see any reason
why you shouldn't be her understudy.

769
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,236
- You think Miss Channing would approve?
- I think she'd cheer.

770
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,472
- But Mr Richards and Mr Sampson?
- They'll do as they're told.

771
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,431
Then... would you speak
to Mr Fabian about it?

772
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,193
- Of course.
- You won't forget?

773
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,471
I won't forget.

774
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,429
I seem to be forever
thanking you for something, don't I?

775
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,913
- The bed looks like a dead animal act.
<i>- (Karen chuckles)</i>

776
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,310
- Which one is sable?
- But she just got here!

777
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,836
Well, she's on her way
with half the men in the joint.

778
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,390
- It's only a fur coat.
- What do you expect? Live sable?

779
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,473
Diamond collar, gold sleeves.
You know - picture people.

780
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,111
<i>(Addison)</i> Elder statesmen
of the theatre or cinema...

781
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,512
...assure the public that actors
and actresses are just plain folks...

782
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,036
...ignoring the fact that their greatest
attraction to the public...

783
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,635
<i>...is</i> their complete lack of resemblance
to normal human beings.

784
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,996
Now there's something
a girl could make sacrifices for.

785
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,469
- And probably has.
- Sable!

786
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,916
- Sable? Did she say sable or Gable?
- Either one.

787
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,037
We all have abnormality in common.

788
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,795
We're a breed apart from the rest
of humanity, we theatre folk.

789
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,997
We are the original displaced personalities.

790
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,755
You won't have to read his column
tomorrow, Eve. You just heard it.

791
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,992
- I don't agree, Addison.
- That's your particular abnormality.

792
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,719
I admit there's a screwball
element in the theatre.

793
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,679
It sticks out, it's got spotlights
on it and a brass band.

794
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,709
But it isn't basic. It isn't standard.
If it were, the theatre couldn't survive.

795
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,032
- Oh, waiter.
- That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.

796
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,429
Well, I can't yell out "butler", can I?

797
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,988
Maybe somebody's name is Butler.

798
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,550
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.

799
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,428
I don't wanna make trouble.
All I want is a drink.

800
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,149
- Leave it to me. I'll get you one.
- Thank you, Mr Fabian.

801
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,436
Well done. I can see your career
rising in the east like the sun.

802
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,758
- You were saying?
- The theatre is nine-tenths hard work.

803
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,392
Work done the hard way - by sweat,
application and craftsmanship.

804
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,030
To be a good actor or actress,
or anything in the theatre...

805
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,839
...means wanting to be that
more than anything else.

806
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,070
Yes. Yes, it does.

807
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,789
It means a concentration
of desire or ambition and sacrifice...

808
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,075
<i>...such</i> as no other profession demands.

809
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,869
And the man or woman who accepts
those terms can't be ordinary...

810
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,030
...can't be just someone.

811
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,953
To give so much for almost always so little!

812
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,235
"So little"?

813
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,390
"So little", did you say?

814
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,836
Why, if there's nothing else,
there's applause.

815
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,071
I've listened backstage to people applaud.

816
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,991
It's like...

817
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,756
Like waves of love coming over
the footlights and wrapping you up.

818
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:32,039
Imagine - to know every night
that different hundreds of people love you.

819
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,159
They smile, their eyes shine,
you've pleased them.

820
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,232
They want you. You belong.

821
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,558
Just that alone is worth anything.

822
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,311
Don't get up. And please stop acting
as if I were the Queen Mother!

823
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,233
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Outside of a beehive, Margo...

824
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,357
<i>...your</i> behaviour is hardly
queenly or motherly.

825
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,431
You're in a beehive, pal!

826
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,957
We're all busy little bees, full of stings,
making honey day and night.

827
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,076
- Aren't we, honey?
- Margo, really!

828
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,914
Please don't play governess, Karen.

829
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,356
I haven't your unyielding good taste.

830
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,911
I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too,
but Father wouldn't hear of it.

831
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,639
He needed help behind a notions counter.

832
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,679
I'm being rude now, aren't I?
Or should I say, <i>ain't</i> I?

833
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,549
You're maudlin and full of self-pity.
You're magnificent.

834
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,995
How about calling it a night?

835
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,548
And you pose as a playwright.

836
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,077
A situation pregnant with possibilities,
and all you can think of is "go to sleep".

837
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,358
- It's a good thought.
- It won't play.

838
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,153
As a nonprofessional,
I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me.

839
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,878
Undramatic, perhaps, but practical.

840
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,679
- Happy little housewife.
- Cut it out.

841
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,470
This is my house, not a theatre.
In my house you're a guest, not a director.

842
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,235
Then stop being a star and treating
your guests as your supporting cast.

843
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,880
- Let's not get into a big hassle.
- It's time we did.

844
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,953
Margo has to realise what's attractive
on stage need not be attractive off.

845
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,429
All right!

846
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,556
I'm going to bed.

847
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,831
You be host. It's your party.
Happy birthday. Welcome home.

848
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,434
And we who are about to die salute you.

849
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,511
Need any help?

850
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,548
To put me to bed?
Take my clothes off, hold my head?

851
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,836
Tuck me in, turn out the lights
and tiptoe out?

852
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,789
Eve would, wouldn't you, Eve?

853
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,394
- If you'd like.
- I wouldn't like.

854
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,799
- Oh, I forgot I had it.
- I didn't.

855
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,476
Too bad. We're gonna miss the third act.

856
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,949
They're gonna play it offstage.

857
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,229
- Coming, Max?
- In a minute.

858
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,392
Eve, you mustn't mind Margo
too much, even if I do.

859
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,711
There must be some reason,
something I've done without knowing.

860
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,554
The reason is Margo and don't try
to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.

861
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,074
But if I thought I'd offended her,
of all people...

862
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:47,598
Eve... I'm fond of Margo, too.
But I know Margo. And every now and then...

863
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,595
...there is nothing I wanna do so much
as kick her right square in the pants.

864
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,148
Well, if she has to pick on someone...

865
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,629
<i>...Id</i> just as soon it was me.

866
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,676
- Max is gonna drop us.
- Good night.

867
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,830
- Good night.
- Good night.

868
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:09,550
Mrs Richards? You won't forget, will you?
What we talked about before?

869
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,631
No, Eve. I won't forget.

870
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,957
Why so remote, Addison?

871
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,476
You should be at the side of
your protégée, lending her moral support.

872
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,473
Miss Caswell is where I can
lend no support, moral or otherwise.

873
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,676
In the ladies' shall we say "lounge"?

874
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,990
Being violently ill to her tummy.

875
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,435
It's good luck before an audition.

876
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,512
Miss Caswell got lucky too late.
The audition is over.

877
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,195
It can't be. I came here to read
with Miss Caswell. I promised Max.

878
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,714
The audition was at 2.30.
It's now nearly four.

879
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,349
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch!
I never have, you know.

880
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,670
Who read with Miss Caswell?

881
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,274
- Bill? Lloyd?
- No.

882
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,989
- Well, it can't have been Max. Who?
- Naturally, your understudy.

883
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,516
It's unnatural to allow a girl
in an advanced state of pregnancy...

884
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,355
I refer to your new and unpregnant
understudy, Miss Eve Harrington.

885
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,000
Eve? My understudy?

886
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,675
- Didn't you know?
- Of course I knew.

887
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,751
It just slipped your mind?

888
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,874
How... was Miss Caswell?

889
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,596
Frankly, I don't remember.

890
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,194
- Just slipped your mind?
- Completely.

891
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,477
Nor can anyone else present
tell you how Miss Caswell read...

892
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,438
<i>...or</i> whether Miss Caswell read
or rode a pogo stick.

893
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,636
Was she that bad?

894
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,159
Margo, I have lived in the theatre
as a Trappist monk lives in his faith.

895
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,834
I have no other world, no other life.

896
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,878
Once in a great while,
I experience that moment of revelation...

897
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,918
<i>...for</i> which all true believers
wait and pray. You were one.

898
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,632
Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely,
Hayes. There are others, three or four.

899
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,915
Eve Harrington will be among them.

900
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,036
I take it she read well.

901
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,395
It wasn't a reading, it was a performance.

902
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,950
Brilliant, vivid,
something made of music and fire.

903
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,076
How nice.

904
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,913
In time, she'll be what you are.

905
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,389
A mass of music and fire.

906
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,470
That's me. An old kazoo with some sparklers.

907
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,310
Tell me, was... Bill swept away too?

908
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,552
- Or were you too full of revelation to notice?
- Bill didn't say.

909
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,395
But Lloyd listened to his play as if
it had been written by someone else, he said.

910
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,631
It sounded so fresh,
so new, so full of meaning.

911
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:55,392
How nice for Lloyd. How nice for Eve.
How nice for everybody.

912
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,993
Eve was incredibly modest.
She insisted that no credit was due her.

913
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,153
That Lloyd felt as he did because she read
his lines exactly as he'd written them.

914
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,312
The implication being
that I did not read them as written?

915
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,712
Neither your name nor your performance
entered the conversation.

916
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,075
<i>(door opens)</i>

917
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,238
Ah! Feeling better, my dear?

918
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,198
Like I just swam the English Channel.
Now what?

919
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,273
Your next move, it seems to me,
should be towards television.

920
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,309
Tell me this.
Do they have auditions for television?

921
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,234
That's all television is, my dear.
Nothing but auditions.

922
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,551
Oh, Margo, darling!

923
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,231
Mm-hm!

924
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,508
Terribly sorry I was late.
Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab.

925
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,831
- Where's Miss Caswell? Oh, hello, Eve.
- Hello, Miss Channing.

926
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,434
How are you making out
in Mr Fabian's office?

927
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,911
Now, Max, I don't want you working this child
too hard just because you promised.

928
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,992
As you see, I</i> kept my promise, too.

929
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,275
It's all over.

930
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,318
- What's all over?
- The audition.

931
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,916
- Eve read with Miss Caswell.
- Eve? How enchanting!

932
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,276
How did you get the idea of letting
Eve read with Miss Caswell?

933
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,399
- Well, she's your understudy.
- Eve? My understudy? I had no idea.

934
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,630
I thought you knew. She started a week ago.

935
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:41,716
I've never seen her backstage, but with
so many people loitering about... Well, well.

936
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,394
So Eve is not working for Max, after all.

937
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,869
Max, you sly puss.

938
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,715
Miss Channing, I can't tell you
how glad I am that you arrived so late.

939
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,793
- Really, Eve? Why?
- Otherwise, I never would have dared to read.

940
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,314
- Why not?
- If you'd come in the middle...

941
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,391
<i>...I</i> couldn't have gone on.

942
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,314
What a pity.
All that fire and music being turned off.

943
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,834
- What fire and music?
- You wouldn't understand.

944
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,911
How was Miss Caswell?

945
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,036
Back to the Copacabana.

946
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,714
But Eve, Margo. Let me tell you about Eve.

947
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:22,158
I was dreadful, Miss Channing. I have no right
to be anyone's understudy, much less yours.

948
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,834
I'm sure you underestimate yourself.
You always do.

949
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,831
You were about to tell me about Eve.

950
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,911
- You'd have been proud of her.
- I'm sure.

951
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,560
- She was a revelation.
- Oh, to you too?

952
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,871
- What do you mean by that?
- It must have been a revelation...

953
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,669
<i>...to</i> have a 24-year-old character
played by a 24-year-old actress.

954
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,115
- That's beside the point.
- It is the point!

955
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,430
It must have seemed
so new and fresh to you...

956
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,671
<i>...so</i> exciting, to have your lines
read just as you wrote them!

957
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,877
- Addison.
- So full of meaning, fire and music!

958
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,994
You've talked to that
venomous fishwife DeWitt.

959
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,799
In this case, as trustworthy
as the world almanac!

960
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,838
You knew when you came in
that Eve was your understudy.

961
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,309
Playing that childish game of cat and mouse!

962
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,472
Not mouse. Never mouse. If anything, rat!

963
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:10,190
Your genius for making a bar-room brawl
out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding.

964
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,919
Perfectly innocent?
Men have been hanged for less!

965
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,309
I'm lied to, attacked behind my back...

966
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,472
...accused of reading your play
as if it were the holy gospel!

967
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,278
I never said it was!

968
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,512
You listen as if someone else had written
your play. Whom do you have in mind?

969
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,757
Arthur Miller? Sherwood?
Beaumont and Fletcher?

970
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,229
- May I say a word?
- No!

971
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,159
You think Miller or Sherwood would stand
for the nonsense I take from you?

972
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,358
Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher.
They've been dead for 300 years!

973
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,078
All playwrights should be dead for 300 years!

974
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,271
That would solve none of their problems
because actresses never die!

975
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,670
The stars never die and never change.

976
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,389
You may change this star
any time you want...

977
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,553
<i>...for</i> a new and fresh and exciting one,
fully equipped with fire and music.

978
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,599
Any time you want,
starting with tonight's performance.

979
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,671
This is for lawyers to talk about.

980
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,389
This concerns a contract
that you cannot rewrite or ad-lib.

981
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,678
Are you threatening me
with legal action, Mr Fabian?

982
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:21,073
- Are you breaking the contract?
- Answer my question.

983
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:25,119
- Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
- I don't hear you.

984
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,954
- I said I'm a dying man!
- Not until the last drugstore...

985
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,634
<i>...has</i> sold its last pill.

986
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,315
I shall never understand the process
by which a body with a voice...

987
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,755
...suddenly fancies itself as a mind.

988
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,229
Just when does an actress decide...

989
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,756
...they're her words she's saying
and her thoughts she's expressing?

990
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,310
Usually at the point
when she has to rewrite and rethink them...

991
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,960
<i>...to</i> keep the audience
from leaving the theatre.

992
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:54,716
It's about time the piano realised
it has not written the concerto!

993
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:06,079
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski
who plays his concerto on me, the piano?

994
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,268
Where is Princess Fire and Music?

995
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,749
- Who?
- The kid. Junior.

996
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,038
- Gone.
- I must have frightened her away.

997
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,918
I wouldn't be surprised.
Sometimes you frighten me.

998
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,276
Poor little flower.
Dropped her petals and folded her tent.

999
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,557
- Don't mix your metaphors.
- I'll mix what I like!

1000
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,677
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.

1001
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,115
What a body. What a voice.

1002
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:40,719
That ex ship-news reporter.
No body, no voice, all mind.

1003
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,192
- The gong rang, the fight's over, calm down.
- I will not calm down.

1004
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,669
Don't calm down.

1005
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,472
- You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
- I'm trying terribly hard.

1006
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,872
Well, you needn't be. I will not be
tolerated and I will not be plotted against.

1007
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,077
- Here we go.
- Such nonsense! What do you take me for?

1008
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,517
Little Nell from the country? Been my
understudy for a week without me knowing it!

1009
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,558
- Carefully hidden, no doubt.
- Don't get carried away.

1010
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,030
Arrives here for an audition
when everyone knows I will be here...

1011
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,750
<i>...and</i> gives a performance out of nowhere!
- You've been all through that with Lloyd.

1012
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,799
The playwright doesn't make the
performance. It doesnt just happen.

1013
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,678
Full of fire and music and whatnot!

1014
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,069
Carefully rehearsed, I have no doubt.

1015
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,799
Full of those Bill Sampson touches.

1016
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,236
- I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts.
- Paranoiac?

1017
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,312
I didn't know Eve was
your understudy until this afternoon.

1018
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:41,952
- Tell that to Dr Freud along with the rest of it.
- No, I'll tell it to you for the last time.

1019
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:46,352
Cos you've got to stop hurting the two of us
by these paranoiac tantrums.

1020
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,955
- That word. I don't even know what it means.
- It's time you found out.

1021
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,554
- I love you. I love you!
- Hah!

1022
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,552
- You're beautiful and intelligent.
- A body with a voice.

1023
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,269
A beautiful and an intelligent woman,
and a great actress.

1024
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,279
A great actress at the peak of her career.
You have every reason for happiness.

1025
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,191
- Except happiness!
- Every reason!

1026
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:10,796
But due to some uncontrollable drive,
you permit the slightest action of a kid...

1027
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,634
- A kid!
<i>...a</i> kid to turn you into a screaming harpy.

1028
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,950
Now, once and for all, stop it!

1029
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,509
It's obvious you're not a woman.

1030
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,359
- I've been aware of that for some time.
- Well, I am.

1031
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,431
I'll say.

1032
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,911
Don't be condescending.

1033
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,389
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.

1034
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:53,474
I may have seen better days, but I'm
still not to be had for the price of a cocktail.

1035
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,551
Like a salted peanut.

1036
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,156
- Margo, let's make peace.
- The terms are too high.

1037
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:05,518
Just being happy? Just stopping
all this nonsense about Eve?

1038
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,160
- And Eve and me?
- It's not nonsense.

1039
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:12,313
But if I tell you it is, as I just did...
were you listening to me?

1040
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,509
- Isn't that enough?
- I wish it were.

1041
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,068
Then what would be enough?

1042
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,390
If we got married?

1043
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,597
I wouldn't want you to marry me
just to prove something.

1044
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,229
You've had so many reasons
for not wanting to marry me.

1045
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,631
Margo, tell me what's behind all this.

1046
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,631
I... I don't know, Bill.

1047
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,029
It's just a feeling. I don't know.

1048
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,031
I think you do know.

1049
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,714
But you won't or can't tell me.

1050
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48,471
I said before it was gonna be
my last try, and I meant it.

1051
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,950
I can't think of anything else to do.
I wish I could.

1052
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,391
We usually wind up screaming
as the curtain comes down.

1053
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,040
Then it comes up again and everything's fine.

1054
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,111
But not this time.

1055
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,713
No playwright in the world
could make me believe...

1056
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,997
<i>...this</i> would happen
between two adult people.

1057
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,311
Goodbye, Margo.

1058
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,310
Bill?

1059
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,275
Where are you going?

1060
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,555
To find Eve?

1061
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,550
That suddenly makes
the whole thing believable.

1062
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,391
<i>(sobs)</i>

1063
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,111
<i>(door opens)</i>

1064
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,951
Lloyd!

1065
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,555
- Lloyd, what's happened?
- Up to here, that's where I've got it.

1066
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,313
Of all the star-ridden,
presumptuous, hysterical...

1067
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,197
- Margo again.
- And again and again.

1068
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,352
- Two hours late for the audition.
- That's on time for Margo.

1069
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:11,194
And then a childish routine about
not knowing Eve was her understudy.

1070
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,510
- It's possible she didn't.
- She knew.

1071
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,479
Addison told her how superbly
Eve had read the part.

1072
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,633
Karen, let me tell you about Eve.
She's got everything. A born actress.

1073
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:26,157
- Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting...
- You'll run out of adjectives, dear.

1074
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,471
Everything a playwright first thinks
of wanting to write about...

1075
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,438
...until his play becomes
a vehicle for Miss Channing.

1076
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,431
Margo hasn't done badly by it.

1077
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,273
Margo's great.
She knows it, that's the trouble.

1078
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,477
She can play <i>Peck's Bad Boy</i>
all she wants and who's to stop her?

1079
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,553
Who's to give her that boot
in the rear she needs and deserves?

1080
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,593
It's gonna be a cosy weekend.

1081
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,638
- What is?
- We're driving to the country tomorrow.

1082
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,917
Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I.

1083
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,675
Well, we've spent weekends
before with nobody talking.

1084
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,197
Just be sure to lock up
all blunt instruments and throwable objects.

1085
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:10,990
<i>(Karen) Newton, they say, thought of gravity</i>
<i>by getting hit on the head by an apple.</i>

1086
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,392
<i>And the man who invented the steam-engine,</i>
<i>he was watching a teakettle.</i>

1087
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,951
<i>But not me. My big idea came</i>
<i>to me just sitting on a couch.</i>

1088
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,788
<i>That boot in the rear to Margo.</i>
<i>Heaven knows, she had one coming.</i>

1089
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,998
<i>From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,</i>
<i>Bill, Max and so on.</i>

1090
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,390
<i>We'd all felt those size fives</i>
<i>of hers often enough.</i>

1091
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,916
<i>But how? The answer was</i>
<i>buzzing around me like a fly.</i>

1092
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,791
<i>I had it!</i>

1093
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,919
<i>But I let it go.</i>
<i>Screaming and calling names is one thing...</i>

1094
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,991
<i>... but this could mean...</i>

1095
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,912
<i>Why not? "Why I said to myself "not?"</i>

1096
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,949
<i>It would all seem perfectly legitimate.</i>
<i>And only two people in the world would know.</i>

1097
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:59,953
<i>Also, the boot would land where</i>
<i>it would do the most good for all concerned.</i>

1098
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,838
<i>After all, it was no more</i>
<i>than a harmless joke...</i>

1099
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,878
<i>... which Margo herself</i>
<i>would be the first to enjoy.</i>

1100
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,953
<i>And no reason why she shouldn't</i>
<i>be told about it... in time.</i>

1101
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:21,952
Hello. Will you please call
Miss Eve Harrington to the phone?

1102
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,311
Not at all. I'll wait.

1103
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,835
<i>(Karen) It was a cold weekend, outside and in.</i>

1104
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,717
<i>Bill didn't come at all.</i>

1105
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,396
<i>Margo didn't know where he was</i>
<i>and didn't care... she kept saying.</i>

1106
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,914
<i>Somehow we staggered through Sunday...</i>

1107
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,675
<i>... and by the time we drove Margo</i>
<i>to the station late Monday afternoon...</i>

1108
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,629
<i>... she and Lloyd had thawed out</i>
<i>to the extent of being civil to each other.</i>

1109
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,713
- What time is it?
- When you asked a minute ago, it was 5.42.

1110
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,837
It is now 5.43.
When you ask again a minute from now...

1111
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,118
I just don't want Margo to miss her train.
As it is, she'll barely make the theatre.

1112
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:03,829
5.55. We'll be at the station in plenty of time.

1113
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,469
That little place
"just two hours from New York".

1114
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:12,714
It's on my list of things I'll never understand,
like collecting shrunken Indian heads.

1115
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,076
You should know what it means
to want a little peace and quiet.

1116
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,799
Peace and quiet is for libraries.

1117
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,950
Lloyd! Please.

1118
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,635
Just a little skid, that's all.
This road's like glass.

1119
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:28,679
- Karen and I just don't want an accident.
- I don't intend to have an accident.

1120
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,878
It isn't important whether <i>you</i> do.
<i>We</i> are wearing long underwear.

1121
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,951
Now what's this?

1122

<i>(car fails to start)</i>

1123
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,116
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas!

1124
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,716
I filled it myself yesterday. Wasn't it full
when you drove to Brewster this morning?

1125
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,156
I didn't look. You know
I don't pay attention to those things.

1126
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,719
Just incredible!

1127
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,792
- How much time have we got?
- Roughly ten minutes.

1128
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,713
- How far is the station?
- About three or four miles.

1129
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,952
- Any houses where we can borrow gas?
- There's not much along this back road.

1130
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,191
Not many cars either.
Not much chance of a lift.

1131
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,273
No sense in sitting here. I'm gonna
walk up about half a mile, just in case.

I wish someone would tell me about me.

You're Margo. Just... Margo.

And what is that? Besides something
spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.

<i>...when</i> they can't have what they want.

He's in love with you.

More than anything in this world,
I love Bill. And I want Bill.

And I want him to want me.

But me, not Margo Channing.

And if I can't tell them apart, how can he?

Well, why should he and why should you?

1161
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:17,190
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's
fought with her, worked with her, loved her.

1162
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:21,398
But ten years from now
Margo Channing will have ceased to exist.

1163
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,950
And what's left will be... what?

1164
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,151
Margo, Bill is all of
eight years younger than you.

1165
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:34,075
Those years stretch as the years go on.
I've seen it happen too often.

1166
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,310
Not to you, not to Bill.

1167

Isn't that what they always say?

1168

About Eve.

01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,231
I've acted pretty disgracefully
toward her too.

1172
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,998
- Well...
- Don't fumble for excuses.

1173
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,719
Not here and now with my hair down.

1174
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,309
At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to...

1175
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:14,155
Well, to the fact that she's so young,
so feminine and so helpless.

1176
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,312
To so many things I want to be for Bill.

1177
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:24,589
It's funny, a woman's career. The things you
drop on your way up so you can move faster.

1178
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,468
You forget you'll need them again
when you get back to being a woman.

1179
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,236
That's one career all females have
in common, whether we like it or not.

1180
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:35,311
Being a woman.

1181
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,914
Sooner or later, we've got to work at it.

1182
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,149
No matter how many
other careers we've had or wanted.

1183
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:47,075
And in the last analysis,
nothing's any good unless you can...

1184
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,674
<i>...look</i> up just before dinner or...

1185
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,274
<i>...turn</i> around in bed and there he is.

1186
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,555
Without that, you're not a woman.

1187
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:59,873
You're something with a French provincial
office or a... a book full of clippings.

1188
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,549
But you're not a woman.

1189
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,315
Slow curtain. The end.

1190
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,356
Margo. Margo, I want you
to know how sorry I am about this.

1191
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,189
- About what?
- This.

1192
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,840
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1193
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,798
Don't give it a thought.
One of destiny's merry pranks.

1194
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,317
After all, you didn't personally
drain the gasoline tank yourself.

1195
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,110
<i>(Addison) Eve, of course, was superb.</i>

1196
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:43,069
<i>Many of the audience understandably</i>
<i>preferred to return another time to see Margo.</i>

1197
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:47,517
<i>But those who remained cheered loudly,</i>
<i>lustily and long for Eve.</i>

1198
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,115
<i>How thoughtful of her to call</i>
<i>and invite me that afternoon.</i>

1199
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,431
<i>And what a happy coincidence</i>
<i>that several representatives...</i>

1200
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,909
<i>... of other newspapers</i>
<i>happened to be present.</i>

1201
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,195
<i>All of us invited that afternoon...</i>

1202
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,751
<i>... to attend an understudy's performance,</i>
<i>about which the management knew nothing...</i>

1203
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,276
<i>... until they were forced</i>
<i>to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock.</i>

1204
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,713
<i>Coincidence.</i>

1205
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,030
<i>(Bill)</i> You were better than all right.

1206
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,556
You rang a bell. Little things
here and there, but it doesn't matter.

1207
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,074
Be proud of yourself. You've got a right to be.

1208
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,151
Are you proud of me, Bill?

1209
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,152
I admit I was worried
when Max called. I had my doubts.

1210
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,518
- You shouldn't have had any doubts.
- After all, the other day was one scene.

1211
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,068
The woods are full of one-scene sensations.

1212
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,869
But you did it. With work and patience,
you'll be a good actress...

1213
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,111
<i>...if</i> that's what you wanna be.
- Is that what you want me to be?

1214
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,113
- I'm talking about you and what you want.
- So am I.

1215
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,197
- What have I got to do with it?
- Everything.

1216
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:52,156
The names I've been called,
but never Svengali. Good luck.

1217
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,400
Don't run away, Bill.

1218
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,869
From what would I be running?

1219
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,354
You're always after truth
on the stage. What about off?

1220
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,277
- I'm for it.
- Then face it. I have.

1221
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,799
- Ever since that first night in here.
- I told you what every actress should know.

1222
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,714
You told me that whatever I became,
it would be because of you.

1223
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,678
- Make-up's a little heavy.
- And for you.

1224
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,473
- You're quite a girl.
- You think?

1225
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:30,350
- I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
- You hear all kinds of things.

1226
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:34,194
I'm only human, rumours to the contrary,
and I'm as curious as the next man.

1227
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,078
- Find out.
- Only thing:

1228
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,310
what I go after I</i> want to go after.

1229
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,391
I don't want it to come after me.

1230
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,709
Don't cry. Just score it
as an incomplete forward pass.

1231
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,836
<i>(knocking)</i>

1232
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,911
Who is it?

1233
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,551
May I come in?

1234
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,551
Certainly, Mr DeWitt.

1235
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,439
I expected to find this room
with a theatreful of people at your feet.

1236
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:32,832
- I'm lucky they didn't throw things.
- Your performance was no surprise to me.

1237
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,230
After the other day, I regarded it
as simply a promise fulfilled.

1238
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,199
You're more than kind. But it's
still Miss Channing's performance.

1239
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,431
I'm the carbon copy you read
when you can't find the original.

1240
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:48,548
- You're more than modest.
- It's not modesty. I don't try to kid myself.

1241
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,915
A revolutionary approach to the theatre.

1242
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,278
- But if I may make a suggestion...
- Please do.

1243
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,272
I think the time has come
to shed some of your humility.

1244
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:02,399
It is just as false not to blow your horn
at all as it is to blow it too loudly.

1245
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,399
I don't think I've done anything
to sound off about.

1246
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:09,393
We come into this world with our little
egos equipped with individual horns.

1247
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,471
If we don't blow them, who else will?

1248
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:17,715
Even so... one pretty good performance by
an understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow.

1249
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,753
It needn't be.

1250
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:27,233
Even if I wanted to, as you say,
be less humble, blow my own horn...

1251
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,278
<i>...how</i> would I do it? I'm less than nobody.

1252
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,636
<i>- I'm</i> somebody.
- You certainly are.

1253
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,476
Leave the door open a bit... so we can talk.

1254
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,351
After you change, if you're not busy
elsewhere, we could have supper.

1255
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,632
I'd love to. Or should I pretend I'm busy?

1256
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:57,033
Let's have a minimum of pretending.
I shall want to do a column about you.

1257
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,350
I'm not even enough for a paragraph.

1258
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:04,070
Perhaps more than one. There's so much
I want to know. I've heard your story in part.

1259
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,790
Your home in Wisconsin, your tragic
marriage, your fanatical attachment to Margo.

1260
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,792
It started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1261
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:16,918
I say your idolatry of Margo
started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1262
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,149
That's right.

1263
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,994
San Francisco, an oasis of
civilisation in the California desert.

1264
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:26,198
Tell me, do you share
my high opinion of San Francisco?

1265
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,271
Yes, I do.

1266
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,078
And that memorable night when Margo
first dazzled you from the stage...

1267
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:37,153
<i>...what</i> theatre was it in San Francisco?
Was it the Shubert?

1268
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,231
Yes, the Shubert.

1269
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,349
Fine old theatre, the Shubert. Full of tradition.

1270
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:47,035
Untouched by the earthquake.
Or should I say fire?

1271
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,799
Tell me, what was your husband's name?

1272
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,751
- Eddie.
- Eddie what?

1273
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:00,195
I'm about to go into the shower.
I won't be able to hear you.

1274
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,077
Well, it can wait.

1275
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,277
Where would you like to go?
We must make this a special night.

1276
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,477
You take charge.

1277
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,357
I believe I will.

1278
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,711
<i>(shower running)</i>

1279
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,709
<i>(Karen) Some morning papers carried</i>
<i>a squib about Eve's performance.</i>

1280
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,155
<i>Not much, but full of praise.</i>

1281
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,708
<i>I couldn't imagine</i>
<i>how they found out about it.</i>

1282
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,793
<i>But Lloyd said Max's publicity man</i>
<i>probably sent out the story.</i>

1283
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,077
<i>At any rate, I felt terribly guilty</i>
<i>and ashamed of myself...</i>

1284
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,391
<i>... and wanted nothing so much</i>
<i>as to forget the whole thing.</i>

1285
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,710
<i>Margo and I were having lunch at 21...</i>

1286
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,314
<i>... just like girlfriends... with hats on.</i>

1287
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,550
- Has Miss Channing come in?
- Not yet.

1288
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,631
Thank you.

1289
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,798
Oh, Eve! I've heard the most wonderful
things about your performance.

1290
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:03,236
- Relief that I managed to stagger through it.
- She was magnificent.

1291
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,470
- Then you've heard, too.
- I was there.

1292
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,438
- You were at the play last night?
- A happy coincidence.

1293
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:12,593
- We're having lunch with a talent scout.
- They certainly don't waste much time.

1294
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:16,309
- It's nothing definite. Just lunch.
- They'll be wasting their time.

1295
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,312
Eve has no intention of going to Hollywood.

1296
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,517
By your smart dress,
I take it your companion is a lady?

1297
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,795
- Margo.
- Margo lunching in public?

1298
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,599
It's a new Margo,
but she's just as late as the old one.

1299
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,069
She may be later than you think.

1300
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,073
Why not read my column to pass the time?

1301
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,879
- The minutes will fly like hours.
- Thank you, Addison.

1302
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,474
Now we must join our sunburnt eager beaver.

1303
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,551
- Goodbye, Karen.
- Goodbye.

1304
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,159
"And so my hat which has,
lo, these many seasons...

1305

is lifted to Miss Harrington."

1306
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:15,794
"I am available for dancing in the streets
and shouting from the housetops."

1307
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:19,509
I thought that one went out with Woollcott!
Now listen to this.

01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,119
<i>...to</i> encourage, shall we say,
younger actresses...

1315
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:48,590
<i>...and</i> Miss Harrington's unsupported
struggle for opportunity."

1316
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,672
- I can't believe Eve said those things.
- In this rat race...

1317
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,354
...everybody's guilty till proved innocent.

1318
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:58,911
One of the differences between
the theatre and civilisation!

1319
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,790
What gets me is how all the papers happened
to catch that particular performance.

1320
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,871
Lloyd says it's a publicity release.

1321
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,633
The witch must have
sent out Indian Runners...

1322
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,714
...snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms
and museums or wherever they hole up.

1323
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:17,429
She won't get away with it.
Nor will Addison DeWitt and his poison pen.

1324
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,990
If Equity or my lawyer can't
or won't do anything about it...

1325
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:26,154
<i>...I</i> shall personally stuff that pathetic little
lost lamb down Mr DeWitt's ugly throat!

1326
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,229
<i>(footsteps)</i>

1327
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:40,837
I came as soon as I read that piece of filth.
I ran all the way.

1328
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,035
Bill's here, baby.

1329
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,111
Everything's all right now.

1330
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,390
I guess at this point
I'm what the French call <i>"de trop".</i>

1331
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,074
Maybe just a little around the edges.

1332
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,074
It's Addison from start to finish.
It drips with his brand of venom.

1333
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,674
Taking advantage of a kid,
twisting her words...

1334
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:31,433
...making her say what he wanted her to say.

1335
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,876
- Where did you get all that information?
- Eve.

1336
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,838
- Eve?
- She's been to see me.

1337
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,071
She left just before you came in.
You just missed her.

1338
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:44,516
- That was a pity.
- Wanted to explain about the interview.

1339
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,229
Wanted to apologise to someone,
and didn't dare face Margo.

1340
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:52,074
- I wonder why.
- She started talking and couldn't finish.

1341
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,151
She cried so.

1342
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:59,599
I've been going over our financial position,
if you'll pardon the expression.

1343
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,992
- That's quite a change of subject.
- What with taxes coming up, and...

1344
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,789
...since I'm a playwright and not
an oil-well operator, I was thinking...

1345
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,075
I'm trying hard to follow you.

1346
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,709
Instead of waiting until next season
to do <i>Footsteps on the Ceiling...</i>

1347
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,597
...which is in pretty good shape...

1348
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:19,434
<i>...and</i> if Margo can be talked into
going on tour with <i>Aged in Wood...</i>

1349
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,512
<i>...we</i> could put <i>Footsteps</i>
into production right away.

1350
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,229
- I'm beginning to catch up.
- If we can cast it properly, that is.

1351
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,950
Maybe get some younger actress? Someone
who'd look the part as well as play it?

1352
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:35,477
- You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty.
- Now you're quoting Addison... or Eve.

1353
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:37,869
Eve did mention the play, but in passing.

1354
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,838
She'd never have the nerve
to ask to play a part like Cora.

1355
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,912
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.

1356
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,151
I got the idea myself while
she was talking about the play.

1357
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:49,959
- With gestures, of course.
- To write something...

1358
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:54,636
<i>...and</i> have it realised completely.
For once, not to compromise.

1359
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:59,671
Lloyd Richards, do not consider giving
that contemptible little worm the part of Cora!

1360
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,515
- Now just a minute...
- Margo's not been exactly a compromise.

1361
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:08,149
Playwrights everywhere would
give their shirts for that compromise.

1362
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,309
Now just a minute...

1363
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,710
Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude
must be contagious!

1364
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,270
All this hysteria because
of an impulsive excited kid...

1365
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:19,158
<i>...and</i> a professional
manure-slinger named DeWitt!

1366
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:22,949
- She apologised, didn't she?
- On her knees, I've no doubt!

1367
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,032
Very touching.
Very Academy of Dramatic Arts(!)

1368
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,999
That bitter cynicism is something
you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!

1369
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:34,198
That cynicism I acquired the day I
discovered I was different from little boys.

1370
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,430
<i>(phone rings)</i>

1371
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,158
Hello!

1372
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,231
Oh, hi, Margo.

1373
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,115
No. No, no, not at all.

1374
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,193
Karen and I were just chatting.

1375
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,271
Hm?

1376
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,431
Why, yes, I'm sure we can
and I'm sure we'd love to.

1377
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,520
Right. 11.45ish.

1378
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,351
See you then.

1379
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:06,594
Margo and Bill want us to meet them
at the Cub Room tonight after the theatre.

1380
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,194
Margo Channing in the Cub Room.

1381
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,590
I couldn't be more surprised
if she'd said Grant's tomb.

1382
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:16,673
- I'm glad Bill's back.
- They'd die without each other.

1383
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:21,036
I didn't promise Eve anything.
I said she'd be fine for the part...

1384
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,315
<i>...but</i> there were practical difficulties.

1385
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,391
- Such as?
- You, for one.

1386
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:29,473
I told her you wanted Margo to play
the part and I would want your approval.

1387
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,630
That's fine. Fine and dandy.

1388
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:35,713
Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington's
future requests to me.

1389
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,957
The so-called art of acting is not one
for which I have a particularly high regard.

1390
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,793
- Hear, hear.
- But you may quote me as follows:

1391
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:51,829
"Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave
a performance in your cockamamie play...

1392
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:57,790
<i>...the</i> like of which I have never seen before
and expect rarely to see again."

1393
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:01,316
- He does not exaggerate. I was good.
- You were great.

1394
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:06,474
Quite a night. I hear your understudy,
a Miss Harrington, has given her notice.

1395
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,596
- Too bad.
- I'm broken up about it.

1396
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:11,433
You just can't pick up
champagne and drink it.

1397
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,909
Somebody's got to be
very witty about a toast.

1398
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,991
I shall propose the toast...

1399
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:19,072
...without wit, with all my heart.

1400
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,712
To Margo.

1401
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,792
- To my bride-to-be.
- Glory hallelujah.

1402
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,991
- Margo!
- Drink!

1403
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,759
- When? When are you going to do it?
- Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten.

1404
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,434
- And you're going to be on time.
- Yes, sir.

1405
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:41,674
City Hall, that's for prizefighters and
reporters. I see a cathedral, banks of flowers...

1406
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,469
It's only for the licence.
There's a three-day wait for blood tests.

1407
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:48,632
I'll marry you if it turns out
you have no blood at all.

1408
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,718
- What are you going to wear?
- Something simple...

1409
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,756
<i>...a</i> fur coat over a nightgown.

1410
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,630
The point is this. In a cathedral,
a ballpark or a penny arcade...

1411
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,474
<i>...we</i> want you two beside us,
as our nearest and dearest friends.

1412
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,757
Which we are. Which we'll always be.

1413
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:10,391
There are very few moments in life
as good as this. Let's remember it.

1414
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:14,189
To each of us and all of us -
never have we been more close.

1415
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:16,669
May we never be farther apart.

1416
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,831
- Mrs Richards?
- Yes.

1417
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,911
- For you.
- Thank you.

1418
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,992
Very indiscreet. A note in the open like that.

1419
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:30,197
Next time, tell your lover
to blow smoke rings or tap a glass.

1420
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,510
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this.

1421
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:36,070
The world is full of love tonight.
No woman is safe.

1422
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:41,553
Well, this beats all world's records
for running, jumping or standing gall.

1423
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,277
"Forgive my butting in to what
seems such a happy occasion...

1424
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,555
<i>...but</i> it's important that I speak with you."

1425
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,995
"Please", and that's underlined...

1426
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,992
..."meet me in the ladies' room. Eve."

1427
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:57,991
I understand she's now
the understudy in there.

1428
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,674
Hand me that empty bottle. I may find her.

1429
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:05,559
Well, look! There's Rasputin!

1430
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,918
<i>- Encore du champagne.</i>
- More champagne, Miss Channing?

1431
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,116
That's what I said, bub.

1432
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:21,069
- Maybe she just wants to apologise.
- I have no interest in anything she may say.

1433
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:24,470
But what <i>could</i> she say?
That's what fascinates me.

1434
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:28,712
- Go on, find out.
- Karen, in all the years of our friendship...

1435
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,236
<i>...I</i> have never let you go
to the ladies' room alone.

1436
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,039
Now I must. I am busting to find out...

1437
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:39,432
...what's going on in that feverish
little brain waiting in there.

1438
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,992
Well... all right.

1439
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,791
Karen!

1440
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,871
How nice.

1441
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:06,678
Very effective, but why take it out on me?

1442
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,836
I was wondering whether you'd come at all.

1443
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:35,753
Don't get up. And don't act
as if I were the Queen Mother.

1444
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,831
I don't expect you to be pleasant.

1445
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,990
I don't intend to be.

1446
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,914
Can't we sit down just for a minute?
I've got a lot to say and none of it's easy.

1447
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,355
- There can't be very much.
- But there is.

1448
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:50,194
- Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it.
- Why should you?

1449
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,071
Please sit down.

1450
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:02,035
You know, I've always considered
myself a very clever girl.

1451
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:05,237
Smart, good head on my shoulders,
that sort of thing.

1452
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:08,676
Never the wrong word at the wrong time.

1453
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:11,149
But then I'd never met Addison DeWitt.

1454
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,470
I remember I had a tooth pulled once.

1455
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:18,677
They gave me some anaesthetic.
I don't remember the name.

1456
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,557
It affected me strangely.

1457
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:24,189
I found myself saying things
I wasn't even thinking.

1458
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:28,193
As if my mind was outside of my body
and couldn't control what I did or said.

1459
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:31,556
- And you felt like that talking to Addison?
- In a way.

1460
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:36,031
You find yourself trying to say what
you mean, but somehow the words change.

1461
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,111
They become his words.

1462
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:42,318
And suddenly you're not saying
what <i>you</i> mean, but what <i>he</i> means.

1463
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:46,632
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't
say any of that? That they were all Addison?

1464
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:48,995
I don't expect you to believe anything...

1465
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:52,993
...except that the responsibility
is mine... and the disgrace.

1466
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,749
Let's not get overdramatic.

1467
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,312
You really have a low opinion
of me, haven't you?

1468
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,395
I'll give you some pleasant news.

1469
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,632
I've been told off
in no uncertain terms, all over town.

1470
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:11,109
Miss Channing should be happy to hear that.

1471
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,998
To know how loyal her friends are...

1472
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:18,119
<i>...how</i> much more loyal than
she had a right to expect me to be.

1473
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,998
- Eve, don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

1474
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:26,719
Tell me, how did your luncheon
turn out with the man from Hollywood?

1475
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:31,794
Some vague promises of a test. If a particular
part should come along, one of those things.

1476
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:36,078
- But the raves about your performance...
- An understudy's performance.

1477
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:40,790
Well, I think you're painting
the picture a little blacker than it is, really.

1478
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,953
Don't underestimate him.
You have a powerful friend in Addison.

1479
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,714
He's not my friend. You were my friends.

1480
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,598
- He can help you.
- I wish I'd never met him.

1481
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,671
I'd like him to be dead.

1482
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,751
I want my friends back!

1483
01:40:55,640 --> 01:41:00,191
Eve... I don't think
you meant to cause unhappiness.

1484
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:04,398
But you did. More to yourself perhaps,
as it turned out, than to anyone else.

1485
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:07,472
- I'll never get over it.
- Oh, yes, you will.

1486
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:11,997
You theatre people always do.
Nothing is for ever in the theatre.

1487
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:16,198
Whatever it is, it's here,
it flares up, burns hot...

1488
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,271
<i>...and</i> it's gone.

1489
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:22,429
- I wish I could believe that.
- Give yourself time.

1490
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,988
Don't worry too much
about what people think.

1491
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,674
You're very young and very talented.

1492
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,998
And, believe it or not,
if there's anything I can do...

1493
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,435
There <i>is</i> something.

1494
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:42,111
- I think I know.
- Something most important you can do.

1495
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:46,553
You wanna play Cora. You want me
to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.

1496
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,712
If you told him so, he'd give me
the part. He said he would.

1497
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:54,430
After all you've said. Don't you know
that part was written for Margo?

1498
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:57,193
It might've been 15 years ago.
It's my part now.

1499
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:02,479
- You talk just as Addison said you did.
- Cora is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd.

1500
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:06,799
- Nothing in the world will make me say that.
- Addison wants me to play it.

1501
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,872
- Over my dead body.
- That won't be necessary.

1502
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:13,755
Addison knows how Margo
happened to miss that performance...

1503
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:18,868
<i>...how</i> I happened to know she'd miss it
in time to notify every paper in town.

1504
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,236
It's quite a story.
Addison could make quite a thing of it.

1505
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:26,438
Imagine how snide and vicious he could get,
and still tell nothing but the truth.

1506
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:29,200
I had a time persuading him.

1507
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,392
You better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.

1508
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:42,151
If I play Cora, Addison will never
tell what happened, in or out of print.

1509
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,198
A simple exchange of favours.

1510
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,590
I'm so happy I can do something
for you at long last.

1511
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:52,796
Your friendship with Margo...

1512
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:55,348
<i>...your</i> deep, close friendship.

1513
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:01,073
What would happen to it if she knew the
cheap trick you played on her for my benefit?

1514
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:04,789
You and Lloyd, how long,
even in the theatre...

1515
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:09,913
...before people forgot what happened
and trusted you again?

1516
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,478
No.

1517
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,792
It would be so much easier for everyone
concerned if I were to play Cora.

1518
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:21,269
So much better theatre, too.

1519
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,071
A part in a play.

1520
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:28,437
You'd do all that just for a part in a play?

1521
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:31,318
I'd do much more for a part that good.

1522
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,671
Hungry?

1523
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:00,949
I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie.

1524
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:04,669
Nothing of the kind.
Karen and I had a nice talk.

1525
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,751
Heart to heart? Woman to woman?

1526
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:11,356
Including a casual reference to the part
of Cora and your hopes of playing it?

1527
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:16,036
I discussed it very openly. I told her I'd
spoken to Lloyd, and that he was interested.

1528
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:20,238
And Karen mentioned, of course,
that Margo expects to play the part?

1529
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:23,995
Oddly enough, she didn't
say a word about Margo.

1530
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:28,437
Just that she'll be happy to do
what she can to see that I</i> play it.

1531
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,069
Just like that, eh?

1532
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,594
Just like that.

1533
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:38,389
You know, Eve, sometimes
I think you keep things from me.

1534
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,831
- I don't think that's funny.
- It wasn't meant to be.

1535
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:46,549
I confide in you and rely on you
more than anyone I've ever known.

1536
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:49,393
To say a thing like that now,
without any reason...

1537
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:51,755
<i>...when</i> I need you more than ever.

1538
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,274
I hope you mean what you say.

1539
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:56,749
I intend to hold you to it.

1540
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,998
We have a great deal
in common, it seems to me.

1541
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:13,989
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing much. She apologised.

1542
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:15,957
- With tears?
- With tears.

1543
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:19,794
But not right away. First fight them back,
chin up, stout fellow.

1544
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:22,269
- Check.
- Very classy. Lots of technique.

1545
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:26,990
You mean all this time she's done
nothing but apologise? What did you say?

1546
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,671
Not much.

1547
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,878
Groom, may I have a wedding present?

1548
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:39,158
- What would you like? Texas?
- I want everybody to shut up about Eve.

1549
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,993
Just shut up about Eve. That's all I want.

1550
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:44,116
Give Karen more wine.

1551
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,236
Never have I been so happy.

1552
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,357
Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room.

1553
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:53,592
What a lovely, clever name.
Where the elite meet.

1554
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:57,832
Never have I seen so much elite,
all with their eyes on me...

1555
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:02,198
...waiting for me to crack that little
gnome on the noggin with a bottle.

1556
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:06,512
But not tonight. I'm forgiving tonight.
Even Eve. I forgive Eve.

1557
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,710
There they go.

1558
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,478
There goes Eve.

1559
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,518
Eve Evil, little Miss Evil.

1560
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,593
But "the evil that men do..."
How does that go, groom?

1561
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:24,356
Something about the good they leave behind.
I played it once in rep in Wilkes-Barre.

1562
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:27,079
You've got it backwards,
even for Wilkes-Barre.

1563
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:30,675
Do you know why I forgive Eve?
She left good behind.

1564
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,158
The four of us here together -
it's Eve fault. I forgive her.

1565
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:39,912
And Bill, especially Bill. She did that too.

1566
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,555
You know, she probably means well after all.

1567
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,916
- She is a louse.
- Never try to outguess Margo.

1568
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,710
- Groom?
- Yes, dear.

1569
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,995
- Do you know what I'm going to be?
- A cowboy?

1570
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:54,038
- A married lady.
- With a paper to prove it.

1571
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,795
I'm going to look up at six o'clock,
and there he'll be.

1572
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,119
- Remember, Karen?
- I remember.

1573
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,788
- You'll be there, won't you?
- Often enough to keep the franchise.

1574
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,440
No more make-believe, offstage or on.

1575
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,154
Remember, Lloyd? I mean it now.

1576
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:14,277
Lloyd, will you promise
not to be angry with me?

1577
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,593
- That depends.
- No, I mean deeply angry.

1578
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,990
I don't think I could be.

1579
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,958
Well, I don't want to play Cora.

1580
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:26,397
- What?
- You're always so touchy about his plays.

1581
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:30,678
It isn't the part. It's a great part
and a fine play. But not for me any more.

1582
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:34,912
Not for a foursquare, upright,
downright, forthright, married lady.

1583
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:40,712
- What's your being married got to do with it?
- It means I've finally got a life to live.

1584
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,598
I don't have to play parts I'm too old for...

1585
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:46,956
<i>...just</i> because I've got
nothing to do with my nights.

1586
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,314
Oh, Lloyd, I'll make it up to you, believe me.

1587
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:55,110
I'll tour a year with this one, anything.
Only you do understand, don't you?

1588
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,115
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

1589
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:07,910
- Nothing?
- Everything. Everything's so funny.

1590
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,954
<i>(Karen) Lloyd never got around to asking...</i>

1591
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:25,953
<i>... whether it was all right with me</i>
<i>for Eve to play Cora.</i>

1592
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:30,909
<i>Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct</i>
<i>the play at first... with Eve in it.</i>

1593
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,673
<i>Lloyd and Max finally won him over.</i>

1594
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:39,596
<i>Margo never came to rehearsal.</i>
<i>Too much to do around the house, she said.</i>

1595
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:43,468
<i>I'd never known Bill and Lloyd</i>
<i>to fight as bitterly and often...</i>

1596
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:46,120
<i>... and always over some business for Eve...</i>

1597
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:49,476
<i>... or a move, or the way she read a speech.</i>

1598
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:53,315
<i>But I'd never known Lloyd</i>
<i>to meddle as much with Bill's directing...</i>

1599
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:56,551
<i>... as far as it affected Eve, that is.</i>

1600
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:59,154
<i>Somehow Eve kept them going.</i>

1601
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,630
<i>Bill stuck it out. Lloyd seemed happy.</i>

1602
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:10,512
<i>And I thought it might be best</i>
<i>if I skipped rehearsals from then on.</i>

1603
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:16,278
<i>It seemed to me I had known always</i>
<i>that it would happen. And here it was.</i>

1604
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:21,070
<i>I felt helpless. That helplessness you</i>
<i>feel when you have no talent to offer...</i>

1605
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:23,310
<i>... outside of loving your husband.</i>

1606
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:27,234
<i>How could I compete?</i>
<i>Everything Lloyd loved about me...</i>

1607
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,311
<i>... he'd gotten used to long ago.</i>

1608
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,391
<i>(phone rings)</i>

1609
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,159
Hello?

1610
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,435
Who? Who's calling Mr Richards?

1611
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:42,479
My name wouldn't mean anything.
I room across the hall from Eve Harrington.

1612
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:45,950
She isn't well. She's been crying
all night and she's hysterical.

1613
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:48,110
She doesn't want a doctor and...

1614
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,551
Who is it? What's it all about?

1615
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:54,952
- Did Miss Harrington tell you to call?
<i>- Oh, no. Eve didn't say to call him.</i>

1616
01:49:55,040 --> 01:50:00,239
I saw Mr Richards with her a couple of times.
I thought, they being such good friends...

1617
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:03,357
This is Lloyd Richards.
Where is Eve? Let me talk to her.

1618
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,591
Hello, Mr Richards.
She's upstairs in her room.

1619
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:10,309
I really hate to bother you this way,
but the way Eve's been feeling...

1620
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:14,029
<i>...Ive</i> been worried sick, what with
her leaving tomorrow for New Haven.

1621
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:17,078
Tell her not to worry. Tell her I'll be right over.

1622
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:38,111
<i>(Addison) To the theatre world,</i>
<i>New Haven, Connecticut...</i>

1623
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:42,830
<i>... is a short stretch of sidewalk between</i>
<i>the Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel...</i>

1624
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:46,310
<i>... surrounded by what looks</i>
<i>very much like a small city.</i>

1625
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:51,190
<i>It is here that managers have</i>
<i>what are called out-of-town openings...</i>

1626
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:55,353
<i>... which are openings for New Yorkers</i>
<i>who want to go out of town.</i>

1627
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:59,277
What a day! What a heavenly day!

1628
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:02,318
- D-day.
- Just like it.

1629
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,552
Tomorrow morning, you will have won
your beachhead on the shores of immortality.

1630
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,631
Stop rehearsing your column.

1631
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:11,471
Isn't it strange, Addison?

1632
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:15,712
I thought I'd be panic-stricken,
want to run away or something.

1633
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:19,839
Instead, I can't wait for tonight
to come. To come and go.

1634
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,036
Are you that sure of tomorrow?

1635
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:24,680
- Aren't you?
- Frankly, yes.

1636
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,991
It'll be a night to remember.

1637
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:35,719
It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted.

1638
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:38,360
The end of an old road,
the beginning of a new one.

1639
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:42,513
- All paved with diamonds and gold?
- You know me better than that.

1640
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,591
Paved with what, then?

1641
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:47,471
Stars.

1642
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,431
What time?

1643
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,511
Almost four.

1644
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,310
Plenty of time for a nice, long nap.

1645
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:57,834
We rehearsed most of last night.

1646
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:00,036
You could sleep now, couldn't you?

1647
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:03,078
- Why not?
- The mark of a true killer.

1648
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,072
Sleep tight, rest easy and come out fighting.

1649
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,799
Why did you call me a killer?

1650
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:13,953
Did I say killer? I meant champion.
I get my boxing terms mixed.

1651
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:18,431
Addison, come in for a minute, will you?

1652
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,909
I've got something to tell you.

1653
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,551
Suites are for expense accounts.
You're being extravagant.

1654
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:38,316
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd
had a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted.

1655
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:43,796
- Can I fix you a drink?
- With the reluctant compliments of Max?

1656
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:46,269
Lloyd. I never have any.

1657
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:49,511
He likes a few drinks after we finish,
so he sent it up.

1658
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:53,513
Some plain soda. Lloyd must be
expecting a record run in New Haven.

1659
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,956
That's for tonight. You're invited.

1660
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:00,112
We're having everyone up
after the performance.

1661
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,156
"We are"?

1662
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,231
Lloyd and I.

1663
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:08,198
I find it odd that Karen
isn't here for the opening.

1664
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,748
- Addison...
- She was always so devoted to Lloyd.

1665
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:14,469
- One would think only death could keep her...
- Addison...

1666
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:20,829
I said this would be a night to remember,
that it would bring me all I ever wanted.

1667
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:25,357
Oh, yes. Something about an old road ending
and a new one starting, all paved with stars.

1668
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,874
I didn't mean just the theatre.

1669
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:29,951
What else?

1670
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:35,034
Lloyd Richards.

1671
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:38,870
He's going to leave Karen.
We're going to be married.

1672
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,993
So that's it. Lloyd.

1673
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:45,753
Still just the theatre, after all.

1674
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,717
It's nothing of the kind!

1675
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,916
Lloyd loves me. I love him.

1676
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:54,312
I know nothing of Lloyd's loves. I leave
those to Louisa May Alcott. But I know you.

1677
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:59,110
- I'm in love with Lloyd.
- He is a commercially successful playwright.

1678
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:02,870
- You have no right to say that.
- And, artistically, very promising.

1679
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,110
Eve, dear, this is Addison.

1680
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,470
Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?

1681
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:12,916
Lloyd and I.
There's no telling how far we can go.

1682
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,436
He'll write great plays for me.
I'll make them great.

1683
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:19,353
You're the only one who knows,
except Lloyd and me.

1684
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,431
- And Karen.
- She doesn't know.

1685
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:24,398
- She knows enough not to be here.
- But not all of it.

1686
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:27,472
- Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married.
- I see.

1687
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:31,071
And when was this unholy alliance joined?

1688
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:34,550
We decided night before last,
before we came up here.

1689
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:37,712
I trust the setting was properly romantic.

1690
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:41,349
Lights on dimmers
and gypsy violins offstage.

1691
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,749
The setting wasn't romantic...

1692
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,796
<i>...but</i> Lloyd was.

1693
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:49,077
He woke me up at three o'clock
in the morning, banging on my door.

1694
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:52,550
He couldn't sleep, he said. He'd left Karen.

1695
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:56,997
Couldn't go on with the play or anything
else until I promised to marry him.

1696
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:59,878
We sat and talked until it was light.

1697
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:02,190
He never went home.

1698
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:06,512
- You sat and <i>talked</i> until it was light?
- We sat and talked, Addison.

1699
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:09,994
I want a run-of-the-play contract.

1700
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:15,473
There never was, and there
never will be, another like you.

1701
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:18,910
Well, say something. Anything!

1702
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,560
<i>Congratulations. Skål.</i> Good work, Eve!

1703
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:32,676
- What do you take me for?
- I don't know that I "take you" for anything.

1704
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:35,638
Is it possible that you've confused me...

1705
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:38,917
<i>...with</i> those backward children
you've played tricks on?

1706
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,719
That you have the same contempt
for me as for them?

1707
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:44,394
I'm sure you mean something,
but I don't know what.

1708
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,948
Look closely, Eve. It's time you did.

1709
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:51,831
I am Addison DeWitt.
I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours.

1710
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:56,113
- I never intended you to be.
- Yes, you did, and you still do.

1711
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:59,715
I don't know what you mean.
But I want to take my nap. It's important...

1712
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:03,509
- It's important that we talk, killer to killer.
- Champion to champion.

1713
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,433
Not with me, you're no champion.
You're stepping up.

1714
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:10,672
Please say what you have to say, plainly
and distinctly, and then let me take my nap.

1715
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:16,357
Very well. Although it's unnecessary,
because you know what I'm going to say.

1716
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:20,149
Lloyd may leave Karen,
but he will not leave Karen for you.

1717
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:24,358
- What do you mean by that?
- More plainly and more distinctly?

1718
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:27,910
I have not come to New Haven
to see the play, discuss your dreams...

1719
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,719
<i>...or</i> pull the ivy from the walls of Yale.

1720
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:34,395
I came to tell you that you will
not marry Lloyd, or anyone else...

1721
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:36,471
...because I will not permit it.

1722
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,028
- What have you got to do with it?
- Everything.

1723
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,591
Because after tonight you will belong to me.

1724
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:45,956
Belong? To you?

1725
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,871
I can't believe my ears!

1726
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,837
A dull cliché.

1727
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,990
"Belong" to you?

1728
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:56,197
That sounds medieval.
Something out of an old melodrama.

1729
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:59,317
So does the history of the world
for the past 20 years.

1730
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:01,436
I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly.

1731
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,876
I'd hoped that you would have
taken it for granted that you and I...

1732
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:06,951
"Taken it for granted"?

1733
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,031
"That you and I..."?

1734
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:16,952
Now remember, as long as you live,
never to laugh at me.

1735
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,918
At anything or anyone else, but never at me!

1736
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:27,028
- Get out.
- You're too short for that gesture.

1737
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:29,509
Besides, it went out with Mrs Fiske.

1738
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:33,632
Then if you won't get out,
I'll have you thrown out.

1739
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:36,598
Don't pick up that phone. Don't even touch it.

1740
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:39,069
Something told you to do
what I said, didn't it?

1741
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:42,835
That instinct is worth millions.
You can't buy it, Eve. Cherish it.

1742
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:46,230
When that alarm goes off,
go to your battle stations.

1743
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:51,871
To begin with, your name is not Eve
Harrington. It's Gertrude Slescynski.

1744
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:55,635
- What of it?
- True, your parents were poor, and still are.

1745
01:57:55,720 --> 01:58:00,271
They would like to know how you are. They
haven't heard from you for three years.

1746
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,351
What of it?

1747
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,036
A matter of opinion, granted.

1748
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:11,070
It's also true you worked in a brewery. But
life there was not as dull as you pictured it.

1749
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:15,790
It got less and less dull, until your boss's
wife had your boss followed by detectives.

1750
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:19,634
- She never proved a thing!
- But the $500 you got to get out of town...

1751
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:22,837
...brought you straight to New York, didn't it?

1752
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,237
- That $500 brought you straight to New York.
- She was a liar. She was a liar!

1753
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:38,835
Answer my question.
Weren't you paid to get out of town?

1754
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,470
There was no Eddie, no pilot.
You've never been married.

1755
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:50,315
That was not only a lie, it was an insult to
dead heroes and the women who loved them.

1756
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:54,473
San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre.
You've never been to San Francisco.

1757
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:58,075
That was a stupid lie, easy to expose,
not worthy of you.

1758
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:03,075
I had to get in to meet Margo. I had to say
something, be somebody. Make her like me!

1759
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,390
She did like you. She helped and trusted you.

1760
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:08,313
- You repaid her by trying to win Bill.
- That's not true!

1761
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:12,393
I was there. I saw you and heard you
through the dressing-room door.

1762
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:16,675
You used my name to blackmail Karen
into getting you the part of Cora.

1763
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:19,718
- You lied to me about it.
- No! No! No!

1764
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,559
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago.

1765
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:27,395
As always with women who try to find out
things, she told more than she learnt.

1766
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:32,278
Now do you want to change your story about
Lloyd beating at your door that night?

1767
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:34,157
Please, please.

1768
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:43,514
That I should want you at all suddenly
strikes me as the height of improbability.

1769
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:47,070
But that in itself is probably the reason.

1770
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:51,836
You're an improbable person, Eve,
and so am I. We have that in common.

1771
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:56,038
Also a contempt for humanity,
an inability to love and be loved.

1772
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:59,749
Insatiable ambition... and talent.

1773
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:03,150
We deserve each other.
Are you listening to me?

1774
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:08,158
- Then say so.
- Yes, Addison.

1775
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:12,319
And you realise and you agree
how completely you belong to me?

1776
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:14,318
Yes, Addison.

1777
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:18,151
Then take your nap,
and good luck for tonight.

1778
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:25,076
I won't play tonight.

1779
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:29,597
I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on.

1780
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:33,719
"Couldn't go on"?
You'll give the performance of your life.

1781
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,391
<i>(door closes)</i>

1782
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:54,552
<i>(Addison) And she gave</i>
<i>the performance of her life.</i>

1783
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:57,234
<i>And it was a night to remember, that night.</i>

1784
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:59,311
<i>(applause and cheering)</i>

1785
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,952
Honoured members of
the Sarah Siddons Society...

1786
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:13,350
...distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

1787
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,955
What is there for me to say?

1788
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:20,350
Everything wise and witty
has long since been said...

1789
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:24,718
<i>...by</i> minds more mature
and talents far greater than mine.

1790
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,156
For me to thank you as equals
would be presumptuous.

1791
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:30,629
I am an apprentice in the theatre...

1792
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:33,712
<i>...and</i> have much to learn from all of you.

1793
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:37,315
Let me say only that I am proud and happy...

1794
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:41,152
<i>...and</i> that I regard this great honour...

1795
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:44,312
<i>...not</i> so much as an award
for what I have achieved...

1796
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:47,676
<i>...but</i> as a standard to hold against
what I have yet to accomplish.

1797
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:49,751
<i>(applause)</i>

1798
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:54,630
And, further, that I regard it
as bestowed upon me only in part.

1799
02:01:55,720 --> 02:02:00,077
The larger share belongs
to my friends in the theatre...

1800
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,628
<i>...and</i> to the theatre itself...

1801
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,518
...which has given me all I have.

1802
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:10,873
In good conscience,
I must give credit where credit is due.

1803
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,790
To Max Fabian. Dear Max.

1804
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:20,273
Dear sentimental, generous,
courageous Max Fabian...

1805
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:24,069
<i>...who</i> took a chance on
an unknown, untried amateur.

1806
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:31,996
To my first friend in the theatre...

1807
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:35,834
...whose kindness and graciousness
I shall never forget...

1808
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,309
...Karen. Mrs Lloyd Richards.

1809
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:48,028
It was Karen who first brought me
to one whom I'd always idolised...

1810
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:51,317
<i>...one</i> who became
my benefactress and champion.

1811
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:56,155
A great actress and a great woman...

1812
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:58,596
...Margo Channing.

1813
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:00,671
<i>(cheering)</i>

1814
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:05,549
To my director...

1815
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:10,395
<i>...who</i> demanded always a little more
than my talent could provide...

1816
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:13,074
<i>...but</i> who taught me patiently and well...

1817
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:16,631
<i>...Bill</i> Sampson.

1818
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,312
<i>(applause)</i>

1819
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:23,233
And one without whose
great play and faith in me...

1820
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:26,593
<i>...this</i> night could never have been.

1821
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:29,035
How can I repay Lloyd Richards?

1822
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:31,111
<i>(applause)</i>

1823
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:33,990
How can I repay the many others...

1824
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:37,038
<i>...so</i> many, I couldn't possibly
name them all...

1825
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:40,078
...whose help, guidance, and advice...

1826
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:46,475
<i>...have</i> made this, the happiest
night of my life, possible.

1827
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:54,559
Although I am going to Hollywood
next week to make a film...

1828
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:57,791
<i>...do</i> not think for a moment
that I am leaving you.

1829
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:59,996
How could I?

1830
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:02,799
My heart is here in the theatre...

1831
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:07,192
<i>...and</i> 3,000 miles are too far
to be away from one's heart.

1832
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:10,158
I'll be back to claim it... and soon.

1833
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:15,554
That is, if you want me back.

1834
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:24,912
Good night to you all,
and to all, a good night.

1835
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:36,518
For services rendered beyond...
whatever it is of duty, darling.

1836
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:46,194
Come on, I'm the host. I got to get home
before my guests start stealing the liquor!

1837
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:51,593
- Congratulations, Eve.
- Thank you, Karen.

1838
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:58,748
- Congratulations, Miss Harrington.
- Oh, thank you so much.

1839
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:03,996
Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry
too much about your heart.

1840
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:07,675
You can always put that award
where your heart ought to be.

1841
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:12,071
I don't suppose there's a drink left?

1842
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:14,833
- You can have one at Max's.
- I don't think I'm going.

1843
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:18,799
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

1844
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:22,316
- I'm so happy for you, Eve.
- Thank you so much.

1845
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:28,589
Max has gone to a lot of trouble. This is going
to be an elaborate party and it's for you.

1846
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:32,070
No, it isn't. It's for this.

1847
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:34,754
- It's the same thing, isn't it?
- Exactly.

1848
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,753
Here, take <i>it</i> to the party instead of me.

1849
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:40,990
You're being very childish.

1850
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:45,119
- I'm tired. I want to go home.
- Very well. I'll drop you off.

1851
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:48,670
I shall go to the party alone.
I have no intention of missing it.

1852
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:13,716
- Who are you?
- Miss Harrington!

1853
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:17,429
- What are you doing here?
- I... I guess I fell asleep.

1854
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:24,353
Please don't have me arrested.
I didn't steal anything. You can search me.

1855
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:28,228
- How did you get in here?
- I hid outside till the maid came in.

1856
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:31,039
She went out to get something
and left the door open.

1857
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:35,033
I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished.
Then I just looked around.

1858
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:38,715
I was afraid someone would notice
the lights were on, so I turned them off.

1859
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:42,236
- Then I guess I fell asleep.
- You were just looking around?

1860
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,151
- That's all.
- What for?

1861
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:46,800
- You probably won't believe me.
- Probably not.

1862
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:49,235
- It was for my report.
- What report? To whom?

1863
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:52,073
About how you live,
what kind of clothes you wear...

1864
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:56,119
<i>...what</i> kind of perfume
and books, things like that.

1865
02:07:56,200 --> 02:08:00,079
You know the Eve Harrington Club that
they have in most girls' high schools?

1866
02:08:00,160 --> 02:08:03,994
- I've heard of them.
- Ours was one of the first - Erasmus Hall.

1867
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:08,198
- I'm the president.
- Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?

1868
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:12,512
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn.
Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward.

1869
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,909
Of course, they're just movie stars.

1870
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,560
You're going to Hollywood, aren't you?

1871
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:18,868
Mm-hm.

1872
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,430
From the trunks you're packing,
you must be going to stay a long time.

1873
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:24,511
I might.

1874
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:31,158
That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet.

1875
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:33,629
Maid'll fix it in the morning.

1876
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:37,318
- I'll just clean up the mess.
- Don't bother.

1877
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:41,072
- How'd you get up here from Brooklyn?
- Subway.

1878
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:44,310
How long does it take?

1879
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:47,198
With changing and everything,
a little over an hour.

1880
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:50,795
It's after one now.
You won't get home till all hours.

1881
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:54,551
I don't care if I never get home.

1882
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:56,710
<i>(buzzer)</i>

1883
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,791
That's the door.

1884
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,751
You rest. I'll get it.

1885
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:13,795
Hello. Who are you?

1886
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:18,479
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr DeWitt.
She asked me to see who it is.

1887
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:20,551
Well, we won't disturb her rest.

1888
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:25,555
It seems Miss Harrington left her award
in the taxi cab. Will you give it to her?

1889
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:29,633
Tell me, how did you know my name?

1890
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:32,994

02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:38,918
- Phoebe?

1893
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:42,037
And why not?

1894
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:47,240
Tell me, Phoebe, do you want someday
to have an award like that of your own?

02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:52,519
- More than anything else in the world.
- Then ask Miss Harrington how to get one.

Miss Harrington knows all about it.

and he brought it back.
