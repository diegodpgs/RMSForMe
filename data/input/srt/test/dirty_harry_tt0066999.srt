1
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,629
Jesus!

2
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,029
"To the city of San Francisco.

3
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:36,509
I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

4
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:39,669
...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

5
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,909
If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

6
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,989
...at personal column,
San Francisco Chronicle...

7
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:48,029
...and I will set up meeting.

8
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,829
If I do not hear from you...

9
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,549
...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a... "

10
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:57,269
"Scorpio. "

11
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:01,989
What goes on in their minds?

12
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,429
Kooks.

13
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,429
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

14
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,949
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

15
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,909
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

16
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,909
Instead, we pay a police department.

17
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:22,189
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

18
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:25,109
Inspector Callahan.
He's outside.

19
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,389
Send Inspector Callahan in.

20
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:35,749
Callahan?

21
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:39,229
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.

22
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:40,509
All right.

23
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:41,909
Let's have it.

24
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,469
- Have what?
- Your report. What have you been doing?

25
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:48,069
For the past 3/4 hour...

26
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:51,109
...I've been sitting on my ass
waiting on you.

27
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:55,029
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

28
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,629
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

29
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:12,349
There's a madman loose.

30
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:15,749
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

31
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:21,789
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

32
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,469
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

33
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:26,829
...rifle nuts, peepers...

34
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:28,629
Mr. Mayor?

35
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:31,789
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

36
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:35,469
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

37
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,189
...and in the black area.

38
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:39,629
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

39
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,189
We're sure it's a 30-06.

40
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,189
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist...

41
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:45,949
We're running a computer check...

42
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,909
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

43
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,629
...October 23 and November 21.

44
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:52,829
Why?

45
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:54,749
Natives of Scorpio.

46
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:57,869
Thank you, Inspector.

47
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,429
Have you mentioned this note to anyone?

48
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:05,189
How about you?

49
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,589
Nobody.

50
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,589
Your wife, sweetheart?
Press?

51
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,029
Nobody.

52
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:16,069
All right. Give the message
to the Chronicle.

53
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:19,469
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.

54
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,589
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

55
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,509
You'll play this creep's game?

56
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:25,469
It'll give us breathing space.

57
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:27,669
It might get somebody killed.

58
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:30,349
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

59
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:34,109
Nope, none of that.
We would end up with a real bloodbath.

60
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:37,029
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

61
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,029
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

62
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,989
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

63
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:52,109
That's my policy.

64
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:55,509
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

65
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:59,909
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

66
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:01,709
Intent?

67
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,549
How did you establish that?

68
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:09,949
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

69
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:13,469
...I figure he isn't out
collecting for the Red Cross.

70
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,989
I think he's got a point.

71
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:14,509
- Inspector Callahan.
- Jaffe.

72
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,189
Usual.

73
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:19,309
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

74
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:20,989
What difference does it make?

75
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,149
Not much.

76
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:26,909
Hey, Jaffe...

77
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,749
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

78
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,949
Tan Ford?

79
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:38,909
Yeah, tan Ford.

80
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:40,109
Engine running?

81
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:43,749
I don't know.
How can I tell?

82
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,389
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
- That's awful!

83
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,589
Look at that pollution.

84
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,389
Do me a favor, will you?

85
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,269
Call this telephone number.

86
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:01,229
Police Department?

87
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:04,109
Tell them Inspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

88
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:07,509
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

89
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:10,229
Got it.

90
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,549
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

91
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:16,509
In progress.
Yes, sir.

92
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:24,429
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

93
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,349
Shit!

94
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:43,709
Halt!

95
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,029
I know what you're thinking.

96
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:10,429
Did he fire six shots or only five?

97
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,669
To tell the truth, in all the excitement
I've kind of lost track myself.

98
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:18,029
Since this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world...

99
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,469
...and would blow
your head clean off...

100
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:24,749
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

101
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,549
Well, do you, punk?

102
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:49,589
I got to know.

103
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,749
Son of a bitch!

104
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,869
It looks like we can save that leg.

105
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:16,989
I've got a couple under my knee.

106
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:18,869
Ever consider
another line of work?

107
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,469
I really appreciate this, Steve.

108
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:24,069
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

109
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:25,869
Nothing fancy, now.

110
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:29,509
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

111
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:32,669
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

112
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:36,989
- I haven't got all night.
- You might experience discomfort.

113
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:40,749
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a...

114
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,989
Sorry, Harry.

115
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,789
- What will you do with those?
- Cut your pants off.

116
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:49,189
- No. We'll pull them off.
- It'll hurt.

117
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,829
For $29.50, let it hurt.

118
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,469
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

119
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:16,149
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Maria.

120
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,149
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

121
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:30,229
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?

122
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,229
Whenever you do.

123
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:36,429
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a. m.
checking the search patterns.

124
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:39,829
- Put in for overtime.
- That'll be the day.

125
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,149
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

126
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:45,389
- He was?
- He wanted me to tell you: "Well done! "

127
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:47,549
I can't tell you how moved I am.

128
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:49,749
I pass along a compliment...

129
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,749
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

130
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:55,829
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

131
00:16:56,109 --> 00:17:00,189
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

132
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:03,269
- I'll get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

133
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:04,989
I'm putting somebody
with you.

134
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:11,749
What are you talking about?

135
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:13,349
You need a partner.

136
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:17,029
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospital!

137
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:20,709
- He'll be out in a few weeks.
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

138
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:23,469
- He'll be working with you.
- You must be kidding.

139
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,749
I have no time to break in newcomers.

140
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:29,029
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

141
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:33,349
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

142
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:34,789
...and Fanduchi's dead.

143
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,229
So?

144
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:40,829
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.

145
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:42,229
What about De Georgio?

146
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:43,709
No way!

147
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:46,069
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

148
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:48,269
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

149
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,269
I got it.

150
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,149
If you see De Georgio,
send him in here!

151
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:01,989
You from around here?

152
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:04,309
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

153
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:07,829
- Play ball?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

154
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:10,869
Just what I need is a college boy.

155
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:14,869
- Found anything you like about me yet?
- It's early yet.

156
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:17,269
- Get your degree?
- Sociology.

157
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:22,189
- Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.
- I intend to.

158
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,549
Inspector Callahan.

159
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:28,349
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

160
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:29,829
I'll remember that.

161
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:34,829
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

162
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:37,829
You're a sweet man, Harry.

163
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:45,149
There is one question,
Inspector Callahan.

164
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:47,429
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?

165
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,429
That's one thing about our Harry.

166
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,829
Doesn't play favorites.

167
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:55,469
Harry hates everybody: limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

168
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,149
You name it.

169
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:01,189
- How does he feel about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

170
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,789
Especially spics.

171
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,669
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

172
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:53,749
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

173
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,149
You, on the roof!

174
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:20,109
You, there!

175
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:21,989
Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.

176
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:24,909
Turn around
and put your hands in the air.

177
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:44,629
I don't know
how the helicopter boys lost him!

178
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,709
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

179
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:51,589
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.

180
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:53,429
That's possible.

181
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:03,709
- Attention, all units.
- Turn that thing up louder.

182
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:08,429
Prowler last seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.

183
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:09,789
He is an adult male.

184
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:13,549
Caucasian. Repeat,
adult male Caucasian.

185
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:15,989
When last seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...

186
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:19,869
...pale blue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gloves.

187
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:21,429
He had a tan suitcase...

188
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:25,709
...which probably contains a
30-06 rifle. He's wanted...

189
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:29,269
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!

190
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:31,309
I know what you mean.

191
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:36,149
- There!
- What?

192
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:37,949
Tan suitcase.

193
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,549
- Where?
- I lost him.

194
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,029
There he goes, over there.

195
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:45,589
Does that bag look tan?

196
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,989
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.

197
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:49,829
Go to Filber and hang a left.

198
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:51,629
Look out for these people!

199
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:54,869
- Fruitcake!
- Get out of the way, hammerhead!

200
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:02,069
It was a tan suitcase.
I know it was.

201
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,349
I saw him.

202
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:07,149
- There he is.
- I see him.

203
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:11,589
Car 2, the license number...

204
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,589
...at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,
Colorado plates.

205
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:23,429
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another entrance. I'll go in here.

206
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,469
Car 2, what's the model
of that Chevrolet?

207
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,949
Car 2. It's an Impala convertible.

208
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:33,749
10-4.

209
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:48,389
You can cancel that 10-25.
Three cars here.

210
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,069
Anybody home?

211
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,189
- I brought you a nice present.
- Let me see it.

212
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:57,789
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

213
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:04,589
You getting an eyeful?

214
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,909
You goddamn pie hawker!

215
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:09,469
- We should call the police.
- I am a police...

216
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:19,709
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

217
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,229
- Let them go.
- Let them go?

218
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:29,029
- You heard me.
- They assaulted a police officer.

219
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:32,309
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...

220
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,389
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

221
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:36,029
Beat it. Get out of here.

222
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:43,549
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

223
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:46,629
I just had another thought.

224
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:48,269
Yeah? About what?

225
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:50,869
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

226
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,029
Inspector 71.

227
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:04,469
Inspector 71.
Please respond to your call.

228
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:07,789
Inspector 71.
Do you read me?

229
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:11,709
- This is Inspector 71.
- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.

230
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:14,509
California Hall
at Polk and Turk streets.

231
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:16,469
10-4. We're on our way.

232
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:37,869
It's some idiot.

233
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:40,149
Where? I don't see him.

234
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:42,989
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

235
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,429
I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.

236
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:51,749
In 600 block of Baker.
On a Chevrolet.

237
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,589
California license D-dog,
C-Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2.

238
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:08,749
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

239
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:25,869
- Anybody try to talk him down?
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here...

240
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:28,749
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

241
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:40,029
Don't you try to get me!

242
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:44,749
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

243
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:48,869
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

244
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:53,909
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

245
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:56,069
Won't you try to grab me?

246
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:02,029
A friend of mine was up about 20 floors
with a jumper a few years ago.

247
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:04,389
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.

248
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:05,629
Mashed all over.

249
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:09,869
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which...

250
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:13,269
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

251
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,909
- I'd just like your name and address.
- Why?

252
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:21,229
It's such a mess down there afterwards!
It makes identification impossible.

253
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:25,069
Even if they find your driver's license!
All that blood!

254
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:30,709
I think I'm going to puke!

255
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:34,509
Don't do that, son.
All those people down there looking up.

256
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,629
The fire chief looking up.
With his face...

257
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:39,389
You bastard!

258
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,829
Get the stretcher up here.

259
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:43,429
Now you know why I'm called Dirty Harry.
Every dirty job that comes along.

260
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:58,109
Inspector 71.

261
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:01,469
This is Inspector 71.

262
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:06,069
Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.

263
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:09,349
What about him?

264
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:12,229
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

265
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:16,029
Anybody know who the boy is?

266
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,309
His name was Charlie Russell.

267
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,109
I'm his mother.

268
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:23,709
He's only 10 years old.

269
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,549
Inspector, this officer...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

270
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:41,869
You'd better go check on the mother.

271
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:54,949
What do you have?

272
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:58,109
That 30-06 shell casing.

273
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:00,069
He was up here all right.

274
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,069
Welcome to Homicide.

275
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:28,669
The man who designed blue serge uniforms
for police departments...

276
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:31,029
...has to sell these for a living!

277
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:37,629
.458 Magnum?

278
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:42,429
- This thing will stop an elephant.
- Yeah.

279
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:47,149
- Apparently you like a little edge.
- All I can get, sir.

280
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:50,429
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.

281
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:52,229
What have you got, Lieutenant?

282
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:56,669
The blue flags represent the units that
are going to be on duty by dark tonight.

283
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,069
- Double shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

284
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:01,989
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

285
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:06,149
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

286
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:08,829
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.

287
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:10,669
We're saving that for him.

288
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,389
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

289
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:17,549
It's a building that overlooks the roof
where they spotted him yesterday.

290
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:19,749
Something bothering you?

291
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,589
- Nothing.
- Speak up. You're among friends here.

292
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:26,789
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

293
00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:30,069
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

294
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:33,669
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

295
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:37,629
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

296
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:41,549
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

297
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:44,189
Must appeal to their
superego or something.

298
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,669
Scorpio strikes again.

299
00:34:47,189 --> 00:34:49,189
They like that feeling.

300
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:52,869
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

301
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:56,029
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

302
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,309
And they're having a novena tonight.

303
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:00,069
Go on.

304
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:03,469
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.

305
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:05,269
The Russell boy was black.

306
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:09,109
He may just figure
he owes himself a padre.

307
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,669
Inspector 71.

308
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:29,189
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

309
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,269
How about the priest?

310
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:56,669
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

311
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:00,749
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.

312
00:36:01,229 --> 00:36:02,389
Who?

313
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:05,229
Never guess.

314
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,749
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

315
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:39,549
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

316
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:55,429
Son of a bitch took the bait!

317
00:37:56,549 --> 00:37:59,549
When I say "now,"
hit him with the light.

318
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:40,709
Now!

319
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:21,749
- You all right?
- I think so.

320
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:15,829
Call an ambulance.

321
00:40:17,189 --> 00:40:18,989
Collins never knew what hit him.

322
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:26,309
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

323
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:28,709
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

324
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:16,069
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

325
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:19,349
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

326
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:22,069
Ann Mary Deacon.

327
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:25,789
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

328
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:30,469
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

329
00:41:30,709 --> 00:41:32,429
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive. "

330
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:35,949
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

331
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:39,909
"Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

332
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:43,709
Now ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

333
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,669
One man with yellow bag.

334
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:48,629
South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

335
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:50,229
9 p. m.

336
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,549
She has oxygen
till 3 a. m. tomorrow.

337
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:55,309
Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

338
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:59,189
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

339
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:01,909
...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio. "

340
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:05,309
Anything else?

341
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:09,229
The mother identified the bra...

342
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:11,029
...the hank of hair...

343
00:42:11,389 --> 00:42:12,509
...and that.

344
00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:14,309
The dentist identified that.

345
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:18,549
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

346
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:21,589
You know she's dead.

347
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:26,069
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a. m.

348
00:42:27,229 --> 00:42:30,629
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

349
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:32,989
He's using up a lot of favors.

350
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:36,589
He wants to pay.

351
00:42:38,229 --> 00:42:39,709
No tricks.

352
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:47,429
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

353
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:50,429
You got it.

354
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:53,629
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p. m.
- All right.

355
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:56,389
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

356
00:42:56,629 --> 00:42:58,309
No cover?
Not even one man?

357
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:01,909
Sure that's how to do it?

358
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:04,949
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

359
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:10,669
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

360
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:13,989
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

361
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:17,789
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

362
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:20,789
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

363
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,789
Testing 1, 2, 3...

364
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:37,269
- What are you yelling for?
- All you have to do is whisper.

365
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:40,349
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow. "

366
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:42,109
Okay, that's better.

367
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:45,149
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

368
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:46,709
...forget it.

369
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:49,029
All right, Sid.
What do I owe you?

370
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:51,349
Bring it back in one piece.

371
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:57,029
$200,000.

372
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:59,189
Count it and sign for it.

373
00:44:01,669 --> 00:44:03,549
Did you count it out?

374
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:07,709
Did you count it, chief?

375
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,549
It's not my responsibility.

376
00:44:13,629 --> 00:44:16,989
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

377
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:22,789
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

378
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:29,549
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

379
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:32,109
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.

380
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:35,349
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

381
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:46,229
Nothing cute.
Nothing fancy.

382
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:49,629
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

383
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,149
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

384
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:09,069
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

385
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:14,629
- You got a yellow suitcase?
- Yeah, I got it right with me.

386
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:19,989
- What's your name?
- Callahan.

387
00:46:20,229 --> 00:46:22,749
- What are you?
- Police officer.

388
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:25,589
Hello?

389
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:37,789
All right, police officer...

390
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,789
...this is how we play.

391
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:44,029
I bounce you all over town
to make sure you're alone.

392
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:47,509
If I even think you're being followed,
the girl dies.

393
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:51,709
If you talk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...

394
00:46:52,029 --> 00:46:53,389
...the girl dies.

395
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:56,589
- Is the girl okay?
- Just shut up and listen.

396
00:46:56,869 --> 00:46:58,109
No car.

397
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:02,109
I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.

398
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:05,789
I ring 4 times.
You don't answer by the fourth ring...

399
00:47:06,029 --> 00:47:07,949
...that's the end of the game.

400
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:09,909
The girl dies.

401
00:47:10,149 --> 00:47:11,949
What time you got?

402
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:16,069
- 9:30. Now listen...
- You listen.

403
00:47:16,749 --> 00:47:18,269
I'm watching you.

404
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:22,349
Not all the time,
but you'll never know when or where.

405
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:27,589
Now get to Forest Hills Station
as fast as you can. Understand?

406
00:47:33,189 --> 00:47:36,029
- Yeah.
- I hope you're not stupid.

407
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:17,189
Downstairs.
Take the "K" car.

408
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:21,029
Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'll blow it.

409
00:50:21,669 --> 00:50:23,469
You sound like you had a good rest.

410
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:27,349
You'll need it. I'm going to give you
a nice little run this time.

411
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:30,829
You better make it,
because if you don't, dead girl!

412
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,109
Public phone,
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.

413
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:39,269
Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.

414
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:13,349
What's in the bag, man?

415
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:17,589
- You dudes get lost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

416
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:19,189
Just give us the wallet.

417
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:24,429
You don't listen, do you, asshole?

418
00:51:51,189 --> 00:51:53,069
Don't answer that!

419
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:06,109
- Who picked it up?
- Some old guy. Never saw him before.

420
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:12,389
Chico, he hung up.

421
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:16,989
- You know Mt. Davidson Park?
- Yeah.

422
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:18,429
Go to the cross.

423
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:58,149
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

424
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,069
I'm going up.

425
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:16,829
I see a couple of people.

426
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:21,829
Just a couple of kids necking.

427
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:24,349
Boys or girls?

428
00:53:42,189 --> 00:53:44,309
I'm Callahan.

429
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:48,189
My friends call me Alice.

430
00:53:48,749 --> 00:53:50,149
And I will take a dare.

431
00:53:51,389 --> 00:53:54,109
When was the last time
you were busted?

432
00:53:54,629 --> 00:53:57,589
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

433
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,389
Well, do it at home.

434
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:01,469
Freeze!

435
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,229
Just like a statue.

436
00:55:05,149 --> 00:55:06,549
That's right.

437
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:10,109
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

438
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:12,909
I'll kill you and the girl both.

439
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:14,869
Understand?

440
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:17,469
Yeah.

441
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:20,229
Drop the bag.

442
00:55:23,709 --> 00:55:24,989
Left hand.

443
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:27,069
Let's see the gun.

444
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,549
My!

445
00:55:33,989 --> 00:55:35,589
That's a big one.

446
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:38,909
Left hand. Throw it.

447
00:55:40,149 --> 00:55:41,349
Easy.

448
00:55:45,549 --> 00:55:46,789
Raise your hands.

449
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:48,749
Come on, get them up.

450
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:53,589
Now turn.

451
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:55,549
Face the cross.

452
00:55:58,029 --> 00:55:59,069
Come on.

453
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:02,029
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

454
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:27,029
You lift that hand once more and
I won't let you know where the girl is!

455
00:56:27,389 --> 00:56:29,229
Do we understand each other?

456
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:31,429
Do we understand each other?

457
00:56:32,709 --> 00:56:34,669
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.

458
00:56:34,949 --> 00:56:36,509
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

459
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:38,829
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

460
00:56:39,909 --> 00:56:42,269
Do we understand each other?

461
00:56:43,029 --> 00:56:47,469
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

462
00:56:47,709 --> 00:56:48,869
Listen to me carefully.

463
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,549
I've changed my mind.

464
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:53,709
I'm going to let her die.

465
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:57,749
I just wanted you to know that.

466
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:06,349
You understand? I ijust wanted to make
sure you knew that before I killed you.

467
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,829
Goodbye, Callahan!

468
00:57:25,869 --> 00:57:27,589
Chico, don't kill him!

469
00:59:17,909 --> 00:59:21,149
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, Chief.

470
00:59:21,389 --> 00:59:23,629
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

471
00:59:24,149 --> 00:59:25,429
He's right here.

472
00:59:25,669 --> 00:59:27,189
He's got two cracked ribs.

473
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:30,109
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

474
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:33,389
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.

475
00:59:33,629 --> 00:59:34,829
I'm sending him home.

476
00:59:35,069 --> 00:59:36,349
Right, Chief.

477
00:59:37,429 --> 00:59:39,109
He says beat it! That's an order.

478
00:59:41,149 --> 00:59:44,589
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

479
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:48,309
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

480
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:50,629
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

481
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,389
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.

482
00:59:53,629 --> 00:59:55,229
What am I going to tell him?

483
00:59:57,709 --> 00:59:59,909
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

484
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:03,629
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

485
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:06,389
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

486
01:00:06,629 --> 01:00:09,949
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

487
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:14,509
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

488
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:23,269
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

489
01:00:26,029 --> 01:00:28,029
- Put him on.
- What is it?

490
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:33,669
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

491
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:38,229
Yeah, Doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

492
01:00:38,709 --> 01:00:40,509
Long blond hair...

493
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:43,549
...medium build, about 150 pounds.

494
01:00:44,189 --> 01:00:45,349
Pale complexion.

495
01:00:45,549 --> 01:00:48,989
- He didn't give you his name, Doc?
- Nope.

496
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:51,749
They usually give a phony name.

497
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,029
But I've seen him someplace.

498
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:59,549
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

499
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,669
I'm trying to think!

500
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,229
It was...

501
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:05,669
I believe he works around here.

502
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:08,829
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

503
01:01:09,069 --> 01:01:10,669
Yes, just a moment.

504
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:16,109
She'll be dead in an hour!

505
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:18,349
I'm trying to remember!

506
01:01:20,629 --> 01:01:22,469
I've got who he is.

507
01:01:23,269 --> 01:01:27,349
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

508
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:30,549
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

509
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:33,349
- Live where?
- There.

510
01:01:38,149 --> 01:01:39,669
Kezar Stadium.

511
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,589
Illegal entry. No warrant.

512
01:02:43,909 --> 01:02:45,589
Looks like we climb.

513
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:48,309
Too much linguine.

514
01:02:50,469 --> 01:02:52,109
I'll find another way.

515
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:02,109
Stop!

516
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:24,349
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

517
01:06:25,669 --> 01:06:26,749
You need any help?

518
01:06:28,189 --> 01:06:32,149
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- Please! No more!

519
01:06:32,549 --> 01:06:35,909
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

520
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:38,509
Let me have a doctor!

521
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:41,229
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

522
01:06:41,749 --> 01:06:43,269
The girl, where is she?

523
01:06:43,469 --> 01:06:44,629
You tried to kill me!

524
01:06:44,869 --> 01:06:48,869
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

525
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:50,229
I want a lawyer.

526
01:06:50,429 --> 01:06:52,269
I said, where's the girl?

527
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:55,589
- I have the right for one.
- Where's the girl?

528
01:06:56,829 --> 01:06:58,949
I have the right to a lawyer!

529
01:06:59,909 --> 01:07:01,309
Don't! Please!

530
01:07:01,549 --> 01:07:03,989
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

531
01:08:38,469 --> 01:08:40,709
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

532
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:44,789
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

533
01:08:45,069 --> 01:08:48,149
- It's Inspector Callahan.
- Have him come in, please.

534
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:51,229
Won't you come this way?

535
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:54,909
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

536
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:04,949
I'll be done in a minute.

537
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:07,029
Have a seat.

538
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:14,589
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

539
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:19,389
A very unusual piece of police work.

540
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:22,269
Really amazing.

541
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:24,669
I had some luck.

542
01:09:24,949 --> 01:09:28,549
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

543
01:09:32,109 --> 01:09:36,029
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

544
01:09:36,269 --> 01:09:40,029
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

545
01:09:40,749 --> 01:09:43,349
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

546
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:47,909
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

547
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:51,989
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

548
01:09:53,349 --> 01:09:56,069
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

549
01:09:56,309 --> 01:09:58,589
You should be.
I've got news for you.

550
01:09:58,749 --> 01:10:01,309
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

551
01:10:02,629 --> 01:10:04,029
What are you talking about?

552
01:10:04,269 --> 01:10:05,429
He's free!

553
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:07,509
You're letting him go?

554
01:10:07,789 --> 01:10:09,469
We have to.
We can't try him.

555
01:10:09,709 --> 01:10:10,909
And why is that?

556
01:10:11,189 --> 01:10:14,069
Because I'm not wasting
1/2 million tax dollars...

557
01:10:14,309 --> 01:10:16,429
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

558
01:10:16,909 --> 01:10:19,349
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

559
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:22,349
- What do you call that?
- I call it nothing.

560
01:10:22,749 --> 01:10:23,949
Zero.

561
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:28,909
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

562
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:32,029
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

563
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:35,229
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

564
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:38,709
- But it's inadmissible as evidence!
- Who says?

565
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:40,069
It's the law.

566
01:10:40,829 --> 01:10:42,229
Then the law is crazy!

567
01:10:43,269 --> 01:10:46,069
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

568
01:10:46,269 --> 01:10:50,949
He also holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

569
01:10:51,149 --> 01:10:52,189
Your Honor?

570
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:58,069
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

571
01:10:58,309 --> 01:11:02,349
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

572
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:04,389
...is inadmissible in court.

573
01:11:04,629 --> 01:11:08,429
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

574
01:11:08,629 --> 01:11:11,749
- It's that simple.
- Search warrant? A girl was dying!

575
01:11:11,989 --> 01:11:14,909
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!

576
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:16,269
But I didn't know that!

577
01:11:16,869 --> 01:11:21,509
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

578
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:25,749
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

579
01:11:26,469 --> 01:11:29,909
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...

580
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:31,349
...physical evidence...

581
01:11:31,549 --> 01:11:33,789
...would have to be excluded.

582
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,429
There must be something
you can get him on!

583
01:11:41,629 --> 01:11:44,469
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

584
01:11:45,269 --> 01:11:47,869
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

585
01:11:49,509 --> 01:11:51,869
Now, the suspect's rights...

586
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:53,829
...were violated...

587
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:56,109
...under the 4th and 5th...

588
01:11:56,349 --> 01:11:59,029
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

589
01:11:59,309 --> 01:12:01,749
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

590
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:04,949
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?

591
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:06,629
The district attorney's office!

592
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,229
If you'll let us.

593
01:12:10,829 --> 01:12:14,789
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

594
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:16,789
He won't be out there long.

595
01:12:17,029 --> 01:12:19,069
What is that supposed to mean?

596
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:22,429
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

597
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:25,229
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

598
01:12:25,869 --> 01:12:29,909
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

599
01:12:30,309 --> 01:12:31,709
How do you know?

600
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,629
Because he likes it.

601
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:57,869
You sure you weren't tailed?

602
01:14:58,389 --> 01:14:59,589
Yeah.

603
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,389
You really want $200 worth.

604
01:15:26,429 --> 01:15:28,269
Every penny of it.

605
01:15:42,029 --> 01:15:43,429
Might as well be comfortable.

606
01:15:44,069 --> 01:15:45,669
Go on, sit.

607
01:15:53,069 --> 01:15:54,509
Relax.

608
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:57,549
Take it easy.

609
01:15:57,909 --> 01:16:00,149
It's going to be all right.

610
01:16:39,789 --> 01:16:41,909
You sure you want the rest of it?

611
01:16:42,629 --> 01:16:44,309
Every penny's worth!

612
01:16:45,829 --> 01:16:49,109
You black son of a bitch!

613
01:17:09,949 --> 01:17:12,269
This one's on the house.

614
01:17:26,269 --> 01:17:27,789
That's got to be him.

615
01:17:30,309 --> 01:17:34,269
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

616
01:17:34,509 --> 01:17:36,309
I swear it. As God is my judge.

617
01:17:36,549 --> 01:17:38,589
Why are they harassing you?

618
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:40,749
They tried to frame me with the murder.

619
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,789
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

620
01:17:43,989 --> 01:17:47,989
I'm supposed to be innocent until proven
guilty and look at what they did to me.

621
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:51,309
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

622
01:17:51,869 --> 01:17:54,709
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.

623
01:17:54,909 --> 01:17:56,869
Did you see who did this to you?

624
01:17:57,109 --> 01:17:58,269
Can you identify him?

625
01:17:58,509 --> 01:18:02,909
His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. Callahan.

626
01:18:05,309 --> 01:18:08,309
Now, that's the rerun
from the 4 o'clock news.

627
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:11,349
Since then he's given
a statement to The Chronicle.

628
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:14,989
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

629
01:18:15,949 --> 01:18:17,629
What about it, Harry?

630
01:18:18,549 --> 01:18:20,909
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.

631
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:22,829
Have you been following him?

632
01:18:24,429 --> 01:18:27,789
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

633
01:18:28,189 --> 01:18:30,309
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
- How?

634
01:18:30,869 --> 01:18:33,669
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

635
01:18:34,429 --> 01:18:36,949
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.

636
01:18:37,229 --> 01:18:39,789
I don't want any more surveillance!

637
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:42,389
Neither does he.

638
01:18:44,309 --> 01:18:45,349
What does that mean?

639
01:18:47,029 --> 01:18:48,589
Good night, sir.

640
01:18:52,349 --> 01:18:53,989
Go ahead. Try them.

641
01:18:54,549 --> 01:18:57,989
- Guy makes them where I always eat.
- Thank you.

642
01:18:58,229 --> 01:19:00,789
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

643
01:19:01,709 --> 01:19:04,269
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

644
01:19:04,909 --> 01:19:07,869
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

645
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:13,909
Doing a lot of thinking about it and...

646
01:19:15,869 --> 01:19:18,989
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

647
01:19:19,709 --> 01:19:21,589
...what for? You know?

648
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:27,629
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

649
01:19:33,429 --> 01:19:35,469
See you tomorrow. Same time?

650
01:19:57,389 --> 01:20:00,029
- It's my fault, you know.
- What?

651
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,909
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.

652
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:04,589
No class.

653
01:20:05,309 --> 01:20:07,429
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

654
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,469
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

655
01:20:10,029 --> 01:20:13,549
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

656
01:20:13,829 --> 01:20:15,749
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

657
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:18,469
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

658
01:20:18,669 --> 01:20:20,909
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

659
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:25,749
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

660
01:20:25,949 --> 01:20:27,149
And I think...

661
01:20:28,309 --> 01:20:30,629
...what if it's the last time I see him?

662
01:20:31,709 --> 01:20:33,269
Am I the only one?

663
01:20:33,589 --> 01:20:35,429
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

664
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:36,789
No.

665
01:20:37,869 --> 01:20:39,949
You mean she got used to it?

666
01:20:40,429 --> 01:20:42,189
No, she never did, really.

667
01:20:42,429 --> 01:20:43,629
What, then?

668
01:20:44,309 --> 01:20:45,829
She's dead.

669
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:48,189
Please, forgive me.

670
01:20:48,869 --> 01:20:51,909
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.

671
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:53,549
No reason for it, really.

672
01:20:54,389 --> 01:20:56,549
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

673
01:20:57,309 --> 01:20:58,869
I want you to tell Chico...

674
01:20:59,749 --> 01:21:01,829
...that I understand him quitting.

675
01:21:02,109 --> 01:21:05,149
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

676
01:21:05,749 --> 01:21:08,789
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

677
01:21:10,349 --> 01:21:11,669
I really don't.

678
01:21:47,429 --> 01:21:49,589
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's.
Please.

679
01:21:51,029 --> 01:21:52,829
What the hell happened to you?

680
01:21:53,069 --> 01:21:54,949
My wife's brother.

681
01:21:55,229 --> 01:21:56,269
I hit her...

682
01:21:56,509 --> 01:21:58,109
...so he hit me.

683
01:21:58,349 --> 01:21:59,789
Several times.

684
01:22:01,309 --> 01:22:02,709
$5.69.

685
01:22:04,589 --> 01:22:07,549
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.

686
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:10,149
14 times the last 3 years.

687
01:22:10,389 --> 01:22:13,269
Last 2 times, I sent them
out of here on platters.

688
01:22:13,549 --> 01:22:15,989
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

689
01:22:17,069 --> 01:22:20,749
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

690
01:22:20,989 --> 01:22:23,349
Please, I scare easy.

691
01:22:26,269 --> 01:22:29,069
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

692
01:23:04,069 --> 01:23:05,189
Goodbye.

693
01:23:06,469 --> 01:23:08,149
See you tomorrow.

694
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:20,269
Everybody out who gets out here?

695
01:23:20,589 --> 01:23:22,109
School bus inspector.

696
01:23:22,349 --> 01:23:24,829
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody...

697
01:23:25,029 --> 01:23:26,589
I'm authorizing it, so go.

698
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:28,629
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

699
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:32,949
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

700
01:23:34,949 --> 01:23:38,429
- Where?
- Just get started. I'll tell you where.

701
01:23:42,989 --> 01:23:44,509
Let's have some fun now.

702
01:23:44,869 --> 01:23:46,229
Who knows a song?

703
01:23:46,509 --> 01:23:49,429
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.

704
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:51,629
Come on, sing for us.

705
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:54,789
Old MacDonald had a farm.

706
01:23:55,029 --> 01:23:56,829
E-I-E-I-O

707
01:23:57,029 --> 01:23:59,669
And on his farm, he had some ducks...

708
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:34,429
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

709
01:25:38,589 --> 01:25:41,029
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

710
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:45,229
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

711
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:49,989
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in half an hour.

712
01:25:50,509 --> 01:25:53,389
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

713
01:25:53,949 --> 01:25:55,749
Tell them the man is dangerous.

714
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:59,629
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

715
01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:01,309
"To the City of San Francisco.

716
01:26:01,509 --> 01:26:03,949
You double-crossed me
for the last time.

717
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:08,709
I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

718
01:26:09,429 --> 01:26:13,029
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

719
01:26:13,269 --> 01:26:15,749
...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...

720
01:26:15,989 --> 01:26:18,269
...exactly what I say. Scorpio. "

721
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,109
Better have somebody standing by!

722
01:26:23,349 --> 01:26:25,189
I don't think it's a false alarm.

723
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,549
There's a call for you on line 2.

724
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:30,109
I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.

725
01:26:36,509 --> 01:26:39,229
- It's the Mayor.
- I got 7 kids from Park Street School.

726
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:42,789
I got the bus and...

727
01:26:43,029 --> 01:26:46,389
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

728
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:48,389
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.

729
01:26:48,789 --> 01:26:50,109
Just tell him.

730
01:26:50,589 --> 01:26:51,949
Not my fault, he had a gun...

731
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:53,029
Just your name!

732
01:26:56,909 --> 01:26:58,309
This is Marcella Platt.

733
01:27:00,109 --> 01:27:02,549
You can check if you want.
But I don't see any point.

734
01:27:02,789 --> 01:27:04,309
I'm not bullshitting.

735
01:27:04,509 --> 01:27:07,469
It's simple. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...

736
01:27:07,709 --> 01:27:09,189
...the kids start dying.

737
01:27:09,389 --> 01:27:12,869
- The plane ready?
- It's being fueled, and ready to go.

738
01:27:13,069 --> 01:27:15,749
The money will be there
by the time you get there.

739
01:27:15,949 --> 01:27:18,989
Listen carefully.
I will drive along nice and easy.

740
01:27:19,229 --> 01:27:21,109
Just me and a busload of kids.

741
01:27:21,429 --> 01:27:24,509
I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake
Blvd., on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.

742
01:27:24,789 --> 01:27:26,509
I don't want any police cars...

743
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:27,829
...helicopters, whatever.

744
01:27:28,229 --> 01:27:32,109
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

745
01:27:32,309 --> 01:27:34,069
Where are you going?

746
01:27:34,669 --> 01:27:37,709
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

747
01:27:39,509 --> 01:27:42,549
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.

748
01:27:42,789 --> 01:27:44,309
I give you my word of honor.

749
01:27:45,589 --> 01:27:47,429
Marcella Platt. It checks.

750
01:27:51,589 --> 01:27:53,629
Willing to take the money to him?

751
01:27:53,909 --> 01:27:57,989
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

752
01:27:58,309 --> 01:28:01,149
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

753
01:28:01,749 --> 01:28:04,589
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!

754
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:06,389
And that's a direct order!

755
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:11,589
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

756
01:29:29,069 --> 01:29:31,029
Row, row, row your boat

757
01:29:31,269 --> 01:29:33,309
Gently down the stream

758
01:29:33,589 --> 01:29:37,629
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

759
01:29:41,469 --> 01:29:43,229
Where are we going?

760
01:29:44,229 --> 01:29:47,749
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

761
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,789
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.

762
01:29:49,989 --> 01:29:52,509
I want to go home to my mother.

763
01:29:52,749 --> 01:29:53,869
Go home to your what?

764
01:29:54,749 --> 01:29:56,389
Now, sing! Sing again!

765
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:58,189
Row, row, row your boat

766
01:29:58,389 --> 01:30:00,149
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

767
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:03,869
Are you sick?
What is it?

768
01:30:04,669 --> 01:30:07,149
Sing or your mothers will die!

769
01:30:07,389 --> 01:30:09,989
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

770
01:30:17,029 --> 01:30:18,869
Get in the right-hand lane.

771
01:30:19,109 --> 01:30:21,389
Not right to treat children that way.

772
01:30:21,669 --> 01:30:23,989
- You'll hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

773
01:30:24,269 --> 01:30:26,229
And get in the right-hand lane!

774
01:30:32,829 --> 01:30:34,869
I want my mother.

775
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:44,469
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.

776
01:30:44,669 --> 01:30:45,709
Make a right there.

777
01:30:46,509 --> 01:30:49,629
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard!

778
01:30:50,269 --> 01:30:52,069
Not this one.

779
01:30:52,669 --> 01:30:53,989
I want my mother.

780
01:30:55,269 --> 01:30:56,229
Shut up!

781
01:30:58,189 --> 01:30:59,709
Just get to the right!

782
01:31:14,029 --> 01:31:15,549
Jesus!

783
01:31:23,309 --> 01:31:25,789
What the hell is he doing up there?

784
01:31:30,269 --> 01:31:33,189
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V. W., will you?

785
01:34:44,509 --> 01:34:46,029
Drop the gun, creep!

786
01:34:48,749 --> 01:34:50,749
I'll blow his brains out.

787
01:34:54,069 --> 01:34:55,709
Drop the fucking gun!

788
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:42,869
I know what you're thinking.

789
01:35:44,069 --> 01:35:47,429
You're thinking,
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?

790
01:35:48,349 --> 01:35:51,549
To tell you the truth, I forgot myself,
in all this excitement.

791
01:35:52,509 --> 01:35:56,109
But being this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world...

792
01:35:56,309 --> 01:35:58,909
...and will blow your head clean off...

793
01:35:59,189 --> 01:36:01,029
...you've got to ask yourself...

794
01:36:02,349 --> 01:36:03,989
..."Do I feel lucky?"

795
01:36:09,709 --> 01:36:11,789
Well, do you, punk?
