Some words have been
translated to American English

3
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:06,839
<i>-I'm really sorry.</i>

4
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:09,472
<i>-Does he wear glasses
or contact lenses?</i>

5
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:12,590
<i>-Glasses.</i>

6
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,472
<i>-You'll have to hurry up.</i>

7
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,394
<i>-He decided that his
brown leather shoes</i>

8
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,285
<i>were the best pair to wear.</i>

9
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:55,863
<i>His back hurt a little,
but not like some other times</i>

10
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:58,542
<i>in the past when
the pain was intolerable.</i>

11
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,448
<i>He was thinking his wife
didn't love him at all anymore.</i>

12
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:08,621
<i>He didn't burst into
tears and he</i>

13
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,231
<i>didn't think that the first
thing most people do</i>

14
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:13,900
<i>when they realize someone
doesn't love them anymore</i>

15
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:15,401
<i>is cry.</i>

16
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:23,098
-Sir, do you mind taking
a look into the camera here for me?

17
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,609
That will do. 
Thank you.

18
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,326
Have you ever been
on your own before?

19
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,214
-No, never.

20
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:38,527
-Are you allergic to any foods?
-No.

21
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:42,008
-Your last relationship
lasted how many years?

22
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:43,411
-Around twelve.

23
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,880
-Do you remember how
long exactly, sir?

24
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:47,997
-Eleven years and
one month.

25
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:51,810
-Sexual preference?
-Women.

26
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:57,197
-However I...I had
one homosexual experience.

27
00:03:57,222 --> 00:03:59,222
In the past. In college.

28
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:03,026
Is there a bisexual
option available?

29
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,318
-No sir, this option
is no longer available

30
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:09,066
since about last summer,
due to several operational problems.

31
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:11,677
-Hmm. -I'm afraid you have
to decide right now if you

32
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:14,277
want to be registered as a
homosexual or a heterosexual.

33
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:26,845
-I think I should be
registered as a heterosexual.

34
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:29,999
-Any children, sir?
-No.

35
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,414
-And the dog?

36
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:31,931
-My brother.

37
00:04:31,956 --> 00:04:34,344
He was here a couple of years
ago but he didn't make it.

38
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:36,108
You might remember him.

39
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:37,616
Medium build.

40
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:38,742
Forty-eight years old.

41
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,593
Bald patch, blond hair.

42
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:42,399
-I'm afraid not, sir.

43
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:46,681
Ok, I would like you
to write your name clearly on this form.

44
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:49,726
In capital letters.
And sign it, please.

45
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,431
Ok, thank you very much.

46
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,342
Ok, so, you are not allowed to use
the volleyball or the tennis courts.

47
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,383
These are only for the couples.

48
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:05,633
You can use the facilities for

49
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:08,845
individual sports such
as squash and golf.

50
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,235
You can stay in the hotel
for up to forty-five days,

51
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,798
You will be staying
 in the single room.

52
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:14,445
If everything goes
well and you make it,

53
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,914
you can move to a double room.

54
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:37,883
-I'm afraid you cannot
keep any of your personal belongings.

55
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,961
We will provide everything
you need as far as

56
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:44,031
garments, accessories and
shoes are concerned.

57
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:46,945
-You can keep this.
-Thank you.

58
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:48,618
-Shoe size, please?

59
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:52,062
-Forty-four and a half.
-Forty four or forty five?

60
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,619
There are no half sizes.

61
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:55,917
-Forty five.

62
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:14,793
-If you need a haircut,
call reception one day ahead.

63
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:16,536
Smoking is not allowed.

64
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:18,570
That way, you will be able
to run for longer during the

65
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,391
hand  without getting tired.

66
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,900
And your breath won't
smell when you kiss.

67
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:24,712
Enjoy your stay.

68
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,690
-Excuse me.

69
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,073
If we need to get a
haircut,

70
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,608
we must call the reception the
day before, is that right?

71
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,155
-That's right.
-Great.

72
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:47,637
<i>-His room number was 101.</i>

73
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,699
<i>A tranquilizer gun was
hanging on the wall above his bed.</i>

74
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:59,560
<i>On the table were twenty
tranquilizer darts,</i>

75
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:01,355
<i>a black plastic watch,</i>

76
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:03,674
<i>a pair of sunglasses,</i>

77
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:05,504
<i>and a cologne for men.</i>

78
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:11,817
<i>Inside the wardrobe were
four identical Grey pants,</i>

79
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,022
<i>four identical button-down
shirts in white and blue,</i>

80
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:20,139
<i>a belt, socks, underwear,
a blazer,</i>

81
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,060
<i>a striped tie, and a
white bathrobe.</i>

82
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:32,020
<i>He looked out the window.</i>

83
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:35,139
<i>The unconscious bodies
of the captured</i>

84
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,858
<i>loners were lying
on the wet ground.</i>

85
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:41,451
<i>Thank God they wore
those waterproof ponchos.</i>

86
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:42,781
<i>He thought.</i>

87
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:46,125
-Room... 115

88
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:49,351
two loners...two extra days

89
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:54,502
Room 272.

90
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:56,704
One loner.

91
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:58,213
One extra day.

92
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:13,244
-Hello.

93
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,373
I'm the hotel manager
and this gentleman is my partner.

94
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:17,840
We'd like to welcome you.

95
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:19,907
You're one of the lucky ones.
You have one of our

96
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:22,114
superior rooms, which
means you have a view.

97
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,076
Did you read the panphlet?

98
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,955
-Yes, I did.
-very good.

99
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:28,037
Now, the fact that you'll
turn into an animal

100
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:30,255
 if you fail to fall in love
with someone here,

101
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,568
is not something that
 should upset you or get you down.

102
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:37,327
Just think: as an animal, you'll have
a second chance to find a companion.

103
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:39,559
But even then
you must be careful.

104
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:43,763
You need to choose a companion
that is a similar type of animal to you.

105
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,831
A wolf and a penguin can
never live together.

106
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:49,248
Nor could a camel and a hippopotamus.

107
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:52,513
That'd be absurd.
Think about it.

108
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:56,513
I understand this discussion
is a little unpleasant for you.

109
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,975
But it is my duty to prepare you

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,405
psychologically for all
possible outcomes.

111
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,115
Now, have you thought
of what animal

112
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,452
you'd like to be if
you end up alone?

113
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,850
-Yes, a lobster.

114
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,833
-Why a lobster?

115
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,374
-Because lobsters live...

116
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:12,355
for over one-hundred years.

117
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:16,133
are blue-blooded like
aristocrats.

118
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,107
And stay fertile

119
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,809
all their lives.

120
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:25,749
I also...like the sea...
very much.

121
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:28,936
I water ski and swim quite
well. Since I was a teenager.

122
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,640
-I must congratulate you.

123
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:33,561
The first thing most people
think of is a dog.

124
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,753
Which is why the
world is full of dogs.

125
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,997
Very few people choose
an unusual animal,

126
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:39,551
which is why they
are endangered.

127
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,741
A lobster's an excellent choice.

128
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:43,265
Could you stand for us, please?

129
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,044
This is to show you how easy
life is when there are two of

130
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:54,085
something rather than one.

131
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:56,636
We tend to forget
that from time to time.

132
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,698
The handcuff will be
removed at the same time tomorrow.

133
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:02,710
-Sorry about him.
-I hope you enjoy your stay with us.

134
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:04,004
Goodbye.

135
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:16,408
-Have a good day.

136
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,389
-Good morning.

137
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:13,585
Room 101.

138
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:15,710
forty-four days left.

139
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:18,014
Breakfast is served.

140
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:44,835
<i>-His first day was
one he'd never forget.</i>

141
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,061
<i>Near his table at breakfast,</i>

142
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,757
<i>sat a young woman
with her head tilted back.</i>

143
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:57,593
<i>Later he would learn that
she often got nosebleeds.</i>

144
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:00,951
<i>Next to her sat her best friend.</i>

145
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:07,022
<i>He thanked the waiter
who served him his coffee</i>

146
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,428
<i>and thought about
his wife for a moment.</i>

147
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,889
<i>A woman who seemed
to like butter cookies</i>

148
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:18,085
<i>offered one to a man drinking
a Campari and soda for breakfast.</i>

149
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:23,710
<i>He then looked behind
him and saw a woman</i>

150
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:27,382
<i>who he would later find
out was absolutely heartless.</i>

151
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,509
<i>And some others
in the couples' area</i>

152
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,264
<i>whom he'd never meet
during his stay at the hotel.</i>

153
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,218
<i>That morning, he was really hungry.</i>

154
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,850
<i>He could have eaten a whole chicken.</i>

155
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:45,520
<i>But ate almost nothing.</i>

156
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:47,455
-Hello.

157
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,133
-Hello.

158
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,788
-I've decided to go for
a walk outside with my new friend.

159
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:54,487
Let me introduce you.
This is Robert.

160
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:57,312
He stays in the room next
to mine and has a lisp.

161
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,664
-Pleased to meet you.
I'm staying in room 101.

162
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,246
-I...I'm on the
same floor. I'm 186.

163
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:06,991
-Would you like to join us?
-Why not?

164
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:27,694
-One of these days, it's
gonna be me on one of those yachts.

165
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:29,399
-What are those yachts?

166
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,210
-The final ordeal before
letting you go, and the hardest one.

167
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,968
Fifteen days of vacation,
just a couple alone

168
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,317
-Did anybody believe it?
-I did.

169
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,748
-Have you seen John's leg?

170
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:45,452
-No.

171
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,264
-John, would you...
show your leg?

172
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:53,236
-Oh, yeah.

173
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:01,061
-Room 187 day two.

174
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,545
-Hello, everyone.

175
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:12,085
My mother was left on her own when
my father fell in love

176
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,499
with a woman who was better
at math than she was.

177
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,150
She had postgraduate degree, I think.

178
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:20,227
Whereas my mother
 was only a graduate.

179
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:23,902
I was nineteen at the time.

180
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:28,099
My mother entered the
hotel but didn't make it

181
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:29,647
and was turned into a wolf.

182
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:31,922
I really missed her.

183
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:35,305
I found out she'd
been moved to a zoo.

184
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,296
I often went there to see her.

185
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,304
I'd give her raw meat.

186
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,952
I knew that wolves liked raw meat.

187
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,772
But I couldn't figure out
which of the wolves was my

188
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:47,225
mother, so I used to give a
little bit to each of them.

189
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:52,428
One day I decided
to enter the enclosure.

190
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:56,827
I really missed her
and I wanted a hug.

191
00:14:57,838 --> 00:14:59,725
I climbed the fence
and jumped in.

192
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:02,921
All the wolves charged
at once and attacked me.

193
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:05,866
All but two, who
stood motionless.

194
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:09,104
My guess is that one of those
two must have been my mother.

195
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,983
The zoo guards got to me
quite quickly and took me to the hospital.

196
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:19,628
Thankfully, I didn't lose my
leg. I just have this limp,

197
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,077
which is also my defining characteristic.

198
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:25,577
My wife died six days ago.

199
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,936
She was very beautiful
and I loved her very much.

200
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,930
She had a limp, too.

201
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,118
-Thank you, John,
you can return to your seat.

202
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:52,530
Let's move on to our next guest:
room 104 day two.

203
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,819
-Hello, everyone.

204
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,530
This is only my
second day here.

205
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:08,719
But already I feel like I'm
in the middle of a wonderful group.

206
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:13,694
My defining characteristic is
that I have a very beautiful smile.

207
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,241
-Have you ever danced
with anybody?

208
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:46,581
-Sorry?

209
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:49,071
-Have you ever danced
with anybody?

210
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:50,330
-Yes!

211
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:54,845
-What sort of dancing
did you do?

212
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,680
-Just depends on the music.

213
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:01,775
Do you need to sit down?

214
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,414
-No, no, no. I'm getting ready to dance.
-Oh.

215
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:10,343
-Can I sit here?

216
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:14,886
Sorry.

217
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,132
-Can I sit here?
-Of course.

218
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,991
Let me introduce you
to my best friend.

219
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,678
That woman you were talking
to has no feelings whatsoever.

220
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,405
She feels nothing at all.

221
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,370
-She's the best hunter
in the hotel.

222
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:41,046
Silent and very fast.

223
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,014
She's the women's
record holder.

224
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,113
192 captives.

225
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,562
-Would you like to dance?

226
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,318
-I'm sorry I got blood in your shirt.

227
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:13,013
But don't worry. There are  many ways
 to remove blood stains in clothing.

228
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,503
One way is to rinse the clothes
with cold water then rub with sea salt.

229
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,205
Another way is to
scrub the stains

230
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,798
with a cotton ball
dipped in ammonia.

231
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:21,397
The third way is
to mix flour and water

232
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:23,421
 into a paste
like toothpaste

233
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:25,813
Especially if the clothes
are delicate or brightly colored.

234
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:28,811
But just never use warm
water on blood, ever.

235
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:30,745
-Great.

236
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:52,975
-I think I have to rest
for a little bit.

237
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,601
My legs hurt.
-That's Ok.

238
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,647
Well, let me know when
you feel better and we can dance again.

239
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,476
-Leave the room
in an orderly fashion.

240
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,553
Do hurry up but
please be careful.

241
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:42,061
We don't need to
get hurt or injured.

242
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:44,389
And good luck with the hunt.

243
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:53,554
-I wish I didn't have this limp.

244
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:57,413
I used to be very
good at running, but not anymore.

245
00:20:58,226 --> 00:20:59,975
I'm sure I'll be slower than them.

246
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:04,303
-If I were you, I'd think of some
tricks that choose the element of surprise.

247
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:08,912
-Instead of speed.
-You're right.

248
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,574
That's what I'll do.

249
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:26,576
Room 186.

250
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:29,365
One loner.
One extra day.

251
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:32,747
38 days that are left.
Plus one, plus nine.

252
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:36,733
Room 180.

253
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:39,999
The days of your
stay remain unchanged.

254
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:43,507
Room 290.

255
00:24:45,071 --> 00:24:46,999
Four loners.
Four extra days.

256
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:51,632
One hundred and fifty-four
days left plus four.

257
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,475
158.

258
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:56,605
Room 101.

259
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,491
The days of your
stay remain unchanged.

260
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:03,780
32 days left.

261
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,139
Breakfast is served.

262
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:15,640
Man eats alone.

263
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,007
-How many darts did you use yesterday?
-Twelve.

264
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:49,749
Please take off your
pants and sit on the bed.

265
00:25:50,454 --> 00:25:53,086
-Can we not do this today?
It's awful.

266
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:55,001
-I know.

267
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:57,220
But I'm afraid we
have to do it.

268
00:25:57,442 --> 00:25:59,780
And you have no idea
how much it helps psychologically

269
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:01,364
in your search for a partner.

270
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,897
-Man eats with woman.

271
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,852
-Is your room number 186?

272
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:29,176
-Yes, it is.

273
00:26:32,306 --> 00:26:34,532
-I imagine you know that
masturbation is not permitted

274
00:26:34,557 --> 00:26:37,079
in the rooms or in any
other area of the hotel.

275
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:38,705
-Yes.

276
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,291
-And yet, it has been brought
to my attention that you continue to do it.

277
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:47,734
-Today, we can erect
quicker than in other days.

278
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:51,152
That's good.
-Please, just a little longer.

279
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:52,365
-Have a good day.

280
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:54,134
-That's awful.

281
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:55,311
Just awful.

282
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:57,896
-Were you looking at a
photograph while you were masturbating?

283
00:26:57,974 --> 00:26:58,997
-Yes.

284
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,850
-What did the photograph show?

285
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:06,743
-A naked woman on a horse.

286
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:07,768
In the country.

287
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:10,235
-If I were in your shoes,
I would not be ogling

288
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,884
the naked woman, but the horse.

289
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:16,110
I'm sure that once was
a weak and cowardly man just like you.

290
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:18,048
-Woman walks alone.

291
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:27,666
-Help!

292
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,078
-This is not necessary. Please.

293
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,884
It was an accident.

294
00:27:33,096 --> 00:27:34,642
I just got carried away.
-Please.

295
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,698
-This is not necessary.
-Please. Place your hand in the toaster,

296
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:38,259
-This could be a warning.

297
00:27:39,564 --> 00:27:41,595
But I've been good otherwise. I...

298
00:27:47,553 --> 00:27:49,215
Ow! Ow!!

299
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,145
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow!

300
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,103
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please!

301
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:57,576
Please, please, I'm sorry!

302
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:00,832
-Woman walks with man.

303
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,251
-What they do
as soon as you enter the room

304
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:34,962
is to wash your head and
your body really well.

305
00:28:35,158 --> 00:28:36,291
-How do you know?

306
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,728
-My uncle used to
know a waiter who worked here.

307
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:43,200
-No waiters know about the procedure.
They are not allowed inside that room.

308
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,599
-Nevertheless

309
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:46,367
They peel off the skin,

310
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:49,485
which has become soft,
due to the water and the soap.

311
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:51,728
Afterward, they remove the heart,

312
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:55,511
the eyes, and other
vital organs of the body

313
00:28:55,597 --> 00:28:57,597
with a laser or scalpels

314
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:01,910
Then the procedure changes
according to the animal when it's chosen.

315
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,241
-That makes total sense.

316
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,213
I mean, I suppose

317
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:08,886
mammals demand a different
kind of work than

318
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:11,160
Ferrets for example.

319
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:12,203
-Exactly.

320
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:15,126
Afterward, they throw the
remaining body parts into the casks

321
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:16,941
outside the hotel's restaurant

322
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:19,621
and distribute the blood
to the hospitals in the city.

323
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:21,109
-Why is that?

324
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:25,183
-The blood is used for surgeries
where there are no blood donors available.

325
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:33,121
-New guests arrived yesterday.
-Yes, I saw them.

326
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,716
-I think I saw a
woman with a limp.

327
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:36,699
-It's just a sprained ankle.

328
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:40,311
She'll be walking normal
again in a few days.

329
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:41,717
-That's a shame.

330
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:45,042
-That is a shame indeed.

331
00:29:49,976 --> 00:29:51,643
<i>-One night, on the coach,</i>

332
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:54,905
<i>He sat next to the woman
who liked butter cookies.</i>

333
00:29:55,116 --> 00:29:56,917
<i>He gazed out of the window.</i>

334
00:29:57,023 --> 00:29:59,089
<i>Not looking at
anything in particular.</i>

335
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:01,605
<i>Just trying to avoid
talking to her.</i>

336
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,714
-How's Bob?
-He's fine.

337
00:30:05,438 --> 00:30:08,582
-I'd give anything to go
on a walk with you and Bob one afternoon.

338
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,882
-The dog's not allowed
out of the room, I'm afraid.

339
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:16,253
<i>-There are some excuses that no
one can argue with. He thought.</i>

340
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:19,507
<i>Some excuses are, without
doubt, better than others.</i>

341
00:30:19,797 --> 00:30:21,864
<i>And that was a really good one.</i>

342
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,613
-These cookies are
for Bob.

343
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:28,394
I want you to give
them to him

344
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:30,207
whenever you want to reward
him for something.

345
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:31,582
Tell him they're from me.

346
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:33,044
-Thank you.

347
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,478
-Could I come to your
room sometime for a chat?

348
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:37,994
I could give you a blow job.

349
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:40,018
Or you can just fuck me.

350
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:42,798
I always swallow after
fellatio and I have absolutely

351
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:44,955
no problem with anal
sex if that's your thing.

352
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:48,769
My ex-husband always used to say I had
the most beautiful eyes he'd ever seen.

353
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,371
But let's not talk about him.

354
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,876
My room number is 180

355
00:30:51,993 --> 00:30:53,860
So my telephone
extension is 180.

356
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,488
I hope I catch some loners tonight.

357
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,862
I haven't caught any
in the last few nights.

358
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:02,207
Hope you catch lots, too.

359
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,138
-Thank you very much.

360
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:09,894
-If I don't find a suitable
partner soon,

361
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,171
I'm going to kill myself by throwing
myself out of one of the rooms.

362
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:16,339
Out the window.

363
00:31:17,683 --> 00:31:19,182
I want you to know that.

364
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,808
My room is on the first floor.

365
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,277
<i>-"I hope I catch some loners today",</i>

366
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:25,302
<i>She said.</i>

367
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,730
<i>"And I hope you catch lots, too."</i>

368
00:31:27,894 --> 00:31:31,691
<i>She then told him that
if she didn't find a suitable partner soon,</i>

369
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:35,839
<i>she was going to kill herself
by jumping from one of the room windows.</i>

370
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:39,003
<i>320, maybe.</i>

371
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,699
<i>Or one higher up.</i>

372
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:41,724
<i>480.</i>

373
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:43,964
<i>That would be even better.</i>

374
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,488
<i>When she stopped talking,</i>

375
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:48,410
<i>he stared at her blankly,</i>

376
00:31:48,497 --> 00:31:50,145
<i>not knowing what to say.</i>

377
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,019
<i>He then looked out at the woods</i>

378
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:56,094
<i>and thought once more
how good his excuse had been.</i>

379
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:00,527
-Not bad. A bit higher.

380
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,167
-You thought about
what animals

381
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:08,452
you want to be if
you don't make it?

382
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:10,343
-A lobster.

383
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:21,753
-I'm going to be a parrot
if I don't make it.

384
00:32:25,205 --> 00:32:27,189
Why don't you become parrots, too?

385
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:29,237
And then we'll all be together.

386
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:30,644
-You're a complete idiot.

387
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:32,746
Picking one of the few
animals that can talk

388
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:34,117
when you have a
speech impairment?

389
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:36,027
You'll lisp, even as an animal.

390
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:38,847
As for you, they'll cut you
and put you in a pot of boiling water

391
00:32:38,872 --> 00:32:41,239
until you die, and then
they'll crack open your claws

392
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:42,878
with a tool, like pliers,

393
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:45,220
and they'll suck up
whatever flesh you have with their mouths,

394
00:32:45,245 --> 00:32:47,292
you're pathetic, both of you.

395
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,889
I'm not going to be
turned into some animal.

396
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:52,363
I'll come and visit you, though.

397
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,003
With my partner.

398
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:55,934
When we're walking together
in some park or...

399
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:59,371
when we're swimming in the sea,
or when we're in one of our trips.

400
00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:10,460
-I'm not afraid.

401
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,628
-Room 187 please.

402
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:22,559
It's no coincidence
that the targets are shaped like

403
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,024
single
people, and not couples.

404
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:09,891
-Hello!

405
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:13,488
-Hello.
-Your swimsuit is very nice.

406
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:14,539
-Thanks.

407
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:18,661
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

408
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:23,937
Do you like to swim breaststroke,
front-crawl, butterfly, or back stroke?

409
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,230
I like also deep-ling.

410
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,937
-You know, I love breaststroke.

411
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:30,012
No, really. My friends
often tease me

412
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:32,186
saying "stop swimming breaststroke
all the time"...

413
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:33,656
And then they laugh.

414
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:35,937
-Breaststroke is great.

415
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:38,116
It's excellent exercise for the back.

416
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:08,883
-When swimming breaststroke,

417
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:11,252
Make sure you wear swim shorts.

418
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:14,069
Because it really limits
movement in the buttocks.

419
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,491
But you knew that, didn't you?

420
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:18,601
-I think your nose is bleeding.
-Really?

421
00:35:21,564 --> 00:35:22,564
-Oh, no.

422
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:26,296
This happens to me all the time.

423
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:30,101
it's really, really annoying.

424
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:33,694
-Oh, no! I have a nose-bleed
problem, too.

425
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:48,209
-I saw what you did.

426
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:49,711
Must have hurt.

427
00:35:58,211 --> 00:35:59,411
-Is it coming out?

428
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,719
-No...

429
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:08,019
Yes.
-Can I use a tissue?

430
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:08,609
Yes.

431
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,447
I'm going to ask you a question,
I want you to answer me honestly.

432
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:17,558
What's worse?

433
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,940
To die of cold and hunger in the woods,

434
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:23,358
to become an animal that will
be killed and eaten by some other animal,

435
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:25,734
or to have a nose-bleed
from time to time?

436
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,976
-To become an animal that will
be killed and eaten by some other animal

437
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:32,477
-Exactly.
-Hmm.

438
00:36:32,665 --> 00:36:34,413
She doesn't suspect
that you're lying?

439
00:36:34,656 --> 00:36:35,656
-No.

440
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:46,491
-I'm very happy because
we have a new couple.

441
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:49,317
They met just two day ago
but they are very much in love

442
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:50,840
and perfectly suited.

443
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:53,075
They both have the
same problem with their noses.

444
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,731
They'd be quite a family.

445
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,171
Tomorrow they will
be transferred to a double room,

446
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:04,855
with a larger closet and
a larger bathroom.

447
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:06,937
They will remain in
the double room for two weeks,

448
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:10,399
And then they will be transferred to
 the yachts for a further two weeks.

449
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,024
We wish you every success

450
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:14,540
and we hope you will
return to the city as a couple.

451
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,469
-I'm very happy!

452
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:21,106
-Me too!

453
00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:22,527
-Congratulations.

454
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:25,472
The course of your relationship
will be monitored closely

455
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:27,816
by our staff and by me personally.

456
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:30,185
If you encounter any
problems, any tensions,

457
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,555
any arguments you cannot
resolve yourselves,

458
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:35,939
you'll be assigned children,
that usually helps. A lot.

459
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:51,547
-Good morning.

460
00:37:51,914 --> 00:37:53,766
Room 101.

461
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,899
Seven days left.

462
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:58,164
Breakfast is served.

463
00:38:39,595 --> 00:38:40,595
You have

464
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:42,243
really nice hair.

465
00:38:42,604 --> 00:38:43,604
-I know.

466
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:54,745
-How do you like mine?

467
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:58,836
-Well, I think you
have quite dry hair.

468
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:00,840
The color's Ok, though.

469
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:04,141
The most important thing
is that you're not bald.

470
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:06,977
However, when it comes to men,

471
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,118
baldness is always a
possibility you can't avoid.

472
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,469
Is your father bald?
-No, he isn't.

473
00:39:13,336 --> 00:39:15,063
And even if I
someday lose my hair,

474
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:17,289
there are things I can
do to get my hair back.

475
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:19,025
I can have a hair transplant.

476
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:20,932
You can always tell when
somebody's had a hair transplant.

477
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:21,642
I know.

478
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:24,048
-Nice hair is not
something you can get.

479
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,799
It's something you're born with.

480
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,361
And the fact that your
father isn't bald

481
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:30,362
shouldn't put you at ease.

482
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:35,142
-Have you decided what you are
 going to do on your last day?

483
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,392
-I'm still thinking about it.

484
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:46,009
-Good morning, ladies.

485
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:53,725
So,

486
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,853
today is your last day.

487
00:39:55,984 --> 00:39:57,814
And, as is custom, you
can choose

488
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,689
how you would like
to spend your last night

489
00:40:00,177 --> 00:40:02,284
What I always say in
these situations is it

490
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:05,393
would be wise to do
something you can't do as an animal.

491
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:07,708
For example, read a
work of Catholic Literature.

492
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:10,049
or sing a song you really like.

493
00:40:10,406 --> 00:40:12,174
It would be silly to choose

494
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:15,542
for example, a walk in the grounds

495
00:40:15,923 --> 00:40:17,860
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person,

496
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:19,251
because those are
things you can do

497
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:20,721
as an animal.

498
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:24,276
But first, your best
friend has written something

499
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:26,779
she'd like to read to you,
which is really very touching.

500
00:40:30,412 --> 00:40:32,284
-"We always sat together at school.

501
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,494
and whenever I had a problem,
I talked to you about it

502
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,096
 because you always
gave the best advice.

503
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:40,589
When we didn't manage to
find dance partners at the school prom,

504
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,967
the fact that we were together
at that difficult moment gave me strength.

505
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:47,385
I'm sorry that things have come to this.

506
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:49,651
I'm sure if you had a
few more days,

507
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:51,940
you would find someone
just like I did.

508
00:40:52,357 --> 00:40:54,206
Because you're an admirable person,

509
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:57,112
and you have very hair
and very nice breasts.

510
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,823
I was always jealous of
your hair, you know that.

511
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,635
You were, are and always
will be my best friend,

512
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,331
and I'll think of you often.

513
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:09,339
And I'll always wear those silver
earrings you gave me for my birthday.

514
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:10,926
I'll miss you.

515
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:14,174
And however many new
girl friends I make in a few days,

516
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,049
when I move back
into the city,

517
00:41:16,293 --> 00:41:18,549
I don't think I'll
find another as true."

518
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,682
-I'd like to watch
the movie 'Stand by me',

519
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:25,002
with River Phoenix,

520
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:27,331
Kiefer Sutherland, and Richard Dreyfuss

521
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,846
Alone.
-Excellent choice.

522
00:41:30,265 --> 00:41:31,265
Lovely film.

523
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:52,190
<i>-Please...leave...a message.</i>

524
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:55,187
<i>-Hello.</i>

525
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:59,026
<i>You're probably in the bathroom,
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.</i>

526
00:41:59,537 --> 00:42:01,612
<i>Nothing like a cold
shower in the morning!</i>

527
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:06,214
<i>Well, I'll...Call you...
a little bit later.</i>

528
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:07,737
<i>After you finish your shower.</i>

529
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:09,669
<i>We'll talk later.</i>

530
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:11,865
<i>Bye.</i>

531
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,581
<i>-One day, as he was playing golf,</i>

532
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:23,771
<i>he thought that it's more
difficult to pretend</i>

533
00:42:23,796 --> 00:42:26,396
<i>that you do have
feelings when you don't,</i>

534
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:29,513
<i>than to pretend you don't
have feelings when you do.</i>

535
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,177
<i>He also thought that
he liked her accent.</i>

536
00:42:34,557 --> 00:42:37,349
<i>And he'd always preferred
women with short hair.</i>

537
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:40,240
<i>So he decided that she was the one.</i>

538
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:42,388
<i>During the hunt,</i>

539
00:42:42,413 --> 00:42:43,746
<i>he would follow her,</i>

540
00:42:43,846 --> 00:42:45,638
<i>and as soon as she shot a loner,</i>

541
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:47,019
<i>he would say to her</i>

542
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:51,466
<i>"I wish we had real guns instead
of these silly tranquilizer ones.</i>

543
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,395
<i>Why don't you kill him
with your bear hands?"</i>

544
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:57,943
<i>And the moment she put her
 hands around the loner's throat,</i>

545
00:42:57,974 --> 00:43:01,599
<i>he would say "I hope
he dies right away."</i>

546
00:43:50,563 --> 00:43:51,875
-What happened?

547
00:43:52,283 --> 00:43:54,564
-She jumped from the
 window of room 180.

548
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,833
There was blood
and crackers everywhere.

549
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,399
-I hope she dies right away.

550
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,300
On second thoughts...

551
00:44:03,044 --> 00:44:05,348
I hope she suffers quite
 a bit before she dies.

552
00:44:05,732 --> 00:44:08,497
I just hope her pathetic screams
can't be heard from my room.

553
00:44:09,138 --> 00:44:10,966
Because I was thinking
of having a lie down.

554
00:44:11,302 --> 00:44:12,684
And I need peace and quiet.

555
00:44:13,794 --> 00:44:15,638
I was playing golf
and I'm quite tired.

556
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:18,599
The last thing I need is
some woman dying slowly and loudly.

557
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,068
-I can't hear you with
 all the screaming.

558
00:44:21,418 --> 00:44:23,600
We'll talk some other
time when it's quieter.

559
00:44:26,936 --> 00:44:27,936
Goodbye.

560
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:33,421
-Goodbye.

561
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:42,295
-One message.

562
00:44:43,068 --> 00:44:44,068
-Hello.

563
00:44:44,585 --> 00:44:47,982
You're probably in the bathroom,
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.

564
00:44:48,466 --> 00:44:50,568
Nothing like a cold
shower in the morning.

565
00:44:51,498 --> 00:44:53,622
Well, I'll...
call you

566
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:56,630
a little bit later,
after you finish your shower.

567
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:58,788
We'll talk later.

568
00:44:59,788 --> 00:45:00,788
Bye.

569
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:05,684
-Mind if I join you?

570
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:16,015
Good Martini.

571
00:46:13,515 --> 00:46:14,882
-I think we are a match.

572
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:16,638
-Yes, I think so, too.

573
00:46:20,202 --> 00:46:22,053
-The keys to the
double room, please.

574
00:46:30,438 --> 00:46:31,841
I wish you the best of luck.

575
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,591
We all wish you the best of luck.

576
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:52,025
-We can only sleep on the left
side of the bed or the right.

577
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,906
-The right.
You?

578
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,220
-The left.
Perfect.

579
00:46:58,205 --> 00:47:00,790
Should I turn off the light
or would you like to read?

580
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:03,470
-I'd like to read.
Does the light bother you?

581
00:47:03,548 --> 00:47:04,196
-No.

582
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,649
I'm not bothered
by light or noise.

583
00:47:07,564 --> 00:47:08,831
I'm a deep sleeper.

584
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,606
-Hello.
-Hello.

585
00:47:28,426 --> 00:47:29,560
-Congratulations.

586
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:31,790
-Thank you.
-This is our new daughter.

587
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,149
Her name's Elizabeth.

588
00:47:33,174 --> 00:47:36,108
Elizabeth, give the nice man a kiss.
He's a friend of mine.

589
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:40,567
-The last thing I want right now
is a kiss from a silly little girl.

590
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,199
-Oh!
-Ow!

591
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,340
-Come on.

592
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,340
-Don't cry, Elizabeth, you
should thank me.

593
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,622
Now you'll have a limp.
You'll be more like your father,

594
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:17,307
-Good morning.

595
00:48:22,425 --> 00:48:23,425
-Morning.

596
00:48:25,176 --> 00:48:26,776
- I killed your brother.

597
00:48:27,586 --> 00:48:29,462
I left him to die very slowly.

598
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,008
He may not be dead yet
even as we speak.

599
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,719
I was kicking him for ages.

600
00:48:36,196 --> 00:48:37,462
-It doesn't matter.

601
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,297
-He whined a little
strange kind of bark.

602
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:43,302
Something like this.

603
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:52,102
Must have been from the pain.

604
00:48:52,491 --> 00:48:54,680
-Didn't hear anything?
-No.

605
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,969
-You really are a deep sleeper.

606
00:48:58,261 --> 00:49:00,797
Would you like some coffee?
-I'd love some.

607
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:04,860
As soon as I wash my face
and brush my teeth off.

608
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:12,005
-I can't wait to hear the story
you promised to tell me last night.

609
00:49:12,896 --> 00:49:15,309
About that student of
yours at the university.

610
00:49:15,482 --> 00:49:17,758
And his awful, final project.

611
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:38,129
-It's really a very funny story.

612
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:40,499
His name was Ryess.

613
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,235
R-Y-E-S-S. Ryess.

614
00:49:50,276 --> 00:49:53,550
These are not tears. It's just water.
 I just washed my face.

615
00:49:54,518 --> 00:49:57,446
-I knew you were lying.
I can't understand why you did it.

616
00:49:57,504 --> 00:49:58,977
When you know as well as anyone

617
00:49:59,002 --> 00:50:01,373
that a relationship
cannot be built on a lie.

618
00:50:01,714 --> 00:50:03,797
We're going to the
 hotel manager right now.

619
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:05,719
And you'll get the
punishment you deserve.

620
00:50:06,124 --> 00:50:07,522
-What's the punishment for this?

621
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:10,196
-They turn you into the
animal no one wants to be.

622
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:56,345
-I saw your partner heading
back that way.

623
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,799
He looked frantic.

624
00:51:58,432 --> 00:51:59,565
Is everything Ok?

625
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:28,938
<i>-At first he wanted to kill her
in some horrible and painful way,</i>

626
00:52:29,123 --> 00:52:31,633
<i>like the death she had
 inflicted on his brother.</i>

627
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:38,071
<i>He thought about kicking
her in the stomach...over and over again</i>

628
00:52:38,432 --> 00:52:40,556
<i>and then stabbing her on the same spot.</i>

629
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:41,838
<i>In the stomach.</i>

630
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:50,438
<i>Then he thought it wouldn't
 be much point, because</i>

631
00:52:50,726 --> 00:52:52,735
<i>she was already
unconscious, so wouldn't</i>

632
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,227
<i>feel any pain from the
kicks or the knife.</i>

633
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,227
-You have to shoot me.
So they won't suspect I helped you.

634
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:03,219
<i>-A hotel maid helped him.</i>

635
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,468
<i>He couldn't understand why she did it.</i>

636
00:53:20,277 --> 00:53:22,652
<i>So he decided to
turn her into an animal.</i>

637
00:53:24,113 --> 00:53:27,355
<i>He dragged her to the room
where the transformations took place.</i>

638
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:32,969
<i>I asked him many times what
sort of animal he turned her into, but</i>

639
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:35,286
<i>he always gave me the same answer,</i>

640
00:53:35,388 --> 00:53:37,083
<i>"That's none of your concern."</i>

641
00:53:45,902 --> 00:53:47,714
<i>That night, he left the hotel</i>

642
00:53:48,074 --> 00:53:49,207
<i>once and for all.</i>

643
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:55,781
<i>He began to run without
 knowing where he was headed.</i>

644
00:53:56,643 --> 00:53:58,236
<i>But he was headed towards us.</i>

645
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,512
<i>This was the start of his new life.</i>

646
00:54:29,286 --> 00:54:32,590
<i>Back then, he didn't know
 how much it hurts to be alone.</i>

647
00:54:35,851 --> 00:54:38,117
<i>How much it hurts when
you cannot reach to rub</i>

648
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:39,805
<i>pain relief ointment on your back.</i>

649
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:42,344
<i>And you're constantly in pain.</i>

650
00:55:28,514 --> 00:55:30,048
-Find him in the woods.

651
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:31,982
He escaped from the hotel.

652
00:55:32,554 --> 00:55:34,422
-Are you a doctor, by any chance?

653
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:35,835
-No.

654
00:55:36,326 --> 00:55:37,326
-That's a pity.

655
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,625
We need a doctor around.

656
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,978
We had one but they caught
 him a couple of months ago.

657
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:44,644
-I'm an architect.

658
00:55:45,928 --> 00:55:46,928
-That's Ok.

659
00:55:47,654 --> 00:55:49,054
You're still welcome.

660
00:55:49,538 --> 00:55:51,687
You can stay with
us for as  long as you like.

661
00:55:52,084 --> 00:55:53,927
You can be a loner
until the day you die.

662
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:56,884
There is no time limit.
-Thank you very much.

663
00:56:11,584 --> 00:56:12,584
-By the way,

664
00:56:12,817 --> 00:56:16,752
any romantic or sexual relations
between loners are not permitted.

665
00:56:17,051 --> 00:56:18,793
And any such acts are punished.

666
00:56:19,082 --> 00:56:20,082
Is that clear?

667
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,441
-Can I have a conversation
 with someone?

668
00:56:25,107 --> 00:56:26,374
-Of course you can.

669
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:29,767
So long as there is no
flirting or anything like that.

670
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,494
That applies to dance nights as well,

671
00:56:33,442 --> 00:56:35,175
We all dance by ourselves.

672
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,502
That's why we only play electronic music.

673
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,299
-What happened to your mouth?

674
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:54,495
-He can't speak.
He was given the red kiss.

675
00:56:56,441 --> 00:56:57,841
-What's the red kiss?

676
00:56:57,866 --> 00:56:59,478
-We slashed his lips with a razor

677
00:57:00,223 --> 00:57:01,628
on the lips of another loner

678
00:57:01,824 --> 00:57:03,668
and forced them to kiss each other.

679
00:57:03,871 --> 00:57:05,613
It was a couple of days ago now.

680
00:57:06,355 --> 00:57:08,495
But the cuts are deep
and they're still in pain.

681
00:57:08,824 --> 00:57:10,757
They were flirting, you know?

682
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,564
<i>-Some punishments are worse
than other punishments.</i>

683
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:28,892
<i>Having your thumb cut is
worse than having your head shaved.</i>

684
00:57:29,682 --> 00:57:32,018
<i>And having a hard-boiled
egg under your armpit</i>

685
00:57:32,043 --> 00:57:34,311
<i>is worse than
having your leg kicked.</i>

686
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:39,009
<i>The punishment I'm afraid of
isn't the red kiss,</i>

687
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,229
<i>but another one that is
called the red intercourse.</i>

688
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:44,665
<i>I have never seen it happen,</i>

689
00:57:44,868 --> 00:57:47,525
<i>but it is not difficult
to imagine what it means.</i>

690
00:57:48,455 --> 00:57:49,455
<i>Oh my god.</i>

691
00:57:49,744 --> 00:57:51,144
<i>I am so afraid of it.</i>

692
00:58:00,866 --> 00:58:01,866
-Move!

693
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:05,061
Hide!

694
00:58:08,668 --> 00:58:09,668
Move!

695
00:58:11,965 --> 00:58:12,965
Hide!

696
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:20,728
<i>-That was the first time I saw him.</i>

697
00:58:21,407 --> 00:58:23,782
<i>He was hiding behind
a tree close to mine.</i>

698
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,633
<i>He seemed quite presentable.</i>

699
00:58:27,698 --> 00:58:28,838
<i>The next day,</i>

700
00:58:28,863 --> 00:58:29,863
<i>in the city,</i>

701
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:32,432
<i>he found out that I
was nearsighted, too.</i>

702
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,082
<i>That night,</i>

703
00:58:40,107 --> 00:58:44,075
<i>in my sleep, I dreamt that we lived
in a big house together in the city,</i>

704
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,318
<i>with a large, well-lit kitchen,</i>

705
00:58:46,343 --> 00:58:48,919
<i>and I was wearing dark blue pants,</i>

706
00:58:49,035 --> 00:58:50,724
<i>and a tight cream blouse,</i>

707
00:58:50,749 --> 00:58:54,099
<i>and he took my clothes
off and fucked me up the ass.</i>

708
00:59:00,982 --> 00:59:02,513
<i>And as he was fucking me,</i>

709
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:04,193
<i>a thug came into the kitchen</i>

710
00:59:04,412 --> 00:59:06,943
<i>and took the steak
knives from the second drawer</i>

711
00:59:06,968 --> 00:59:07,968
<i>and attacked us,</i>

712
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:11,154
<i>stabbing the knives into
 our bellies one by one.</i>

713
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,338
<i>I woke up terrified.</i>

714
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:25,595
-Try harder

715
00:59:27,118 --> 00:59:29,802
Don't give up. You know
you should have been more careful.

716
00:59:31,297 --> 00:59:32,716
Try harder, or
they're going to find you

717
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:34,138
and you'll be turned
into an animal.

718
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,400
A weak one.

719
00:59:37,985 --> 00:59:39,275
We must get a move on now.

720
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,136
It's really too
dangerous to stay here.

721
00:59:41,216 --> 00:59:44,716
If you manage to free yourself,
run as fast as you can and come find us.

722
00:59:44,741 --> 00:59:47,864
If you manage to free yourself
but think you'll die from the beating,

723
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:49,255
go straight to your grave.

724
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:51,435
Have you dug your own grave?

725
00:59:51,778 --> 00:59:52,376
Yes.

726
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:54,497
Very good.

727
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:56,557
That's enough for now.

728
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:07,254
I'm going to go hunting for truffles.

729
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:09,208
They're delicious and quite rare.

730
01:00:09,774 --> 01:00:11,474
A kilo can fetch a lot of money.

731
01:00:11,499 --> 01:00:14,294
-You're going to need a pig.
They're impossible to find otherwise.

732
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:14,989
I know.

733
01:00:15,014 --> 01:00:17,114
Don't be long. Gotta get
then back in fifteen minutes.

734
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:17,685
-Ok.

735
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,583
-Hello, David.

736
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:47,114
-Hello, Robert.

737
01:00:50,203 --> 01:00:52,265
-What you did to that
woman was dreadful.

738
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:53,516
-She killed my brother.

739
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:56,210
I would have done the
same thing if she killed you.

740
01:00:56,508 --> 01:00:57,963
You...you're like
a brother to me.

741
01:00:58,152 --> 01:01:00,063
Oh, you're my best friend
in the whole world.

742
01:01:00,563 --> 01:01:02,969
-I don't think I'm your best
friend in the whole world.

743
01:01:03,532 --> 01:01:06,716
You used to spend much more time with John.
-Oh, who's John?

744
01:01:07,931 --> 01:01:09,180
-John, the limping man.

745
01:01:09,313 --> 01:01:11,430
-Oh, yeah. I didn't even
 remember his name.

746
01:01:12,399 --> 01:01:13,399
Or his face.

747
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,138
You're the one I think of
whenever I need a friend.

748
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,982
Nevertheless, did John make it?

749
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,302
-They're getting ready
for the yacht.

750
01:01:24,611 --> 01:01:26,211
It all begins this week.

751
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:28,130
-Everyone says they're
going to make it,

752
01:01:28,155 --> 01:01:29,732
as they are perfectly
suited and the child

753
01:01:29,757 --> 01:01:31,537
will help them with the
fighting and the arguing.

754
01:01:31,757 --> 01:01:33,030
-That's great.

755
01:01:33,077 --> 01:01:34,655
-You're not thinking
about coming back?

756
01:01:35,716 --> 01:01:37,992
You know, If you told the hotel
manager about your brother,

757
01:01:38,017 --> 01:01:39,240
she'd probably forgive you.

758
01:01:39,311 --> 01:01:41,848
-No.
It's really nice to be on your own.

759
01:01:41,997 --> 01:01:43,630
There's no one
tying you down,

760
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:45,829
you listen to music
whenever you like,

761
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,735
you masturbate whenever you want,

762
01:01:47,862 --> 01:01:49,541
go for walks whenever you like,

763
01:01:50,135 --> 01:01:51,790
have a chat whenever you like...

764
01:01:51,868 --> 01:01:53,868
I don't miss companionship at all.

765
01:01:54,903 --> 01:01:57,161
I just miss you, because
you're my one true friend.

766
01:01:59,443 --> 01:02:00,681
Are you gonna shoot me?

767
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:02,341
-I'm afraid so.

768
01:02:02,771 --> 01:02:03,841
Only have two days left.

769
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:05,518
-What did you say?

770
01:02:05,872 --> 01:02:07,872
I can't understand
the way you speak.

771
01:02:08,365 --> 01:02:10,747
-I'm going to shoot you.
I only have two days left.

772
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:11,780
I need more time.

773
01:02:11,911 --> 01:02:13,748
-You actually believe
a day will make a difference?

774
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:15,575
 Have you seen how
 ugly you are?

775
01:02:15,943 --> 01:02:18,177
You haven't got a chance.
If I was a woman I...

776
01:02:24,005 --> 01:02:25,739
-Don't tell anyone I helped you.

777
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,068
If you want to repay me,
there is a way.

778
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:30,020
If you kill a rabbit,
bring it to me to eat.

779
01:02:32,144 --> 01:02:33,144
Do you promise?

780
01:02:33,547 --> 01:02:34,547
-Yes.

781
01:02:34,687 --> 01:02:36,146
-Bye.
-Bye.

782
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:20,021
-Boujur
-Bonjur.

783
01:03:24,197 --> 01:03:26,931
You brought what I asked for?
Of course.

784
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,251
The gun is in the pocket

785
01:03:33,338 --> 01:03:36,104
with the electronic keys with the
numbers of the double rooms.

786
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,900
Try not to lose the keys.

787
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:40,386
I need to return them

788
01:03:42,135 --> 01:03:45,557
I propose we act on Saturday.
After the ball Everyone is tired...

789
01:03:45,643 --> 01:03:48,596
and most employees are
gone on the week-end.

790
01:03:49,643 --> 01:03:50,710
And the shampoo?

791
01:03:51,932 --> 01:03:52,932
I forgot.

792
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:55,849
I'll bring two bottles next time.

793
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:57,896
Do you know how fantastic you are?

794
01:03:58,896 --> 01:04:02,630
Please make a note for the
shampoo so you don't forget.

795
01:04:04,935 --> 01:04:06,802
I need to tell you something

796
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:08,092
What?

797
01:04:09,193 --> 01:04:10,793
This is my last mission.

798
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,886
I can't do it anymore.

799
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:17,410
I can't stand living in that horrible
mansion with that fat dentist.

800
01:04:17,865 --> 01:04:20,615
He keeps asking if I've flossed.

801
01:04:20,873 --> 01:04:24,107
He makes me clean my teeth
after every meal no matter how small it is.

802
01:04:24,646 --> 01:04:26,723
After we're finished setting
up for the big night

803
01:04:26,748 --> 01:04:28,076
you can come and live with us.

804
01:04:28,101 --> 01:04:29,522
I'll find another mole.

805
01:04:30,865 --> 01:04:34,443
I don't think I'll ever find
someone as efficient as you

806
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:36,667
but I need to respect your wishes.

807
01:04:37,138 --> 01:04:38,661
Be patient just a few more days...

808
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:41,474
and don't forget to take
your birth control pill. Ok?

809
01:04:42,037 --> 01:04:44,622
Thank you.
No, thank you.

810
01:04:45,595 --> 01:04:47,130
You were fantastic.

811
01:05:14,415 --> 01:05:17,365
<i>-You carefully fillet
the rabbit with a sharp knife</i>

812
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:18,896
<i>and cut off its head.</i>

813
01:05:21,837 --> 01:05:23,943
<i> You then slice open its belly</i>

814

red and green peppers,</i>

815

little garlic and mint.</i>

816
01:05:35,642 --> 01:05:37,591
<i> You then soak it in lemon juice</i>

817

Woman. Brunette.

Marriage certificate expired
two months ago.

824
01:08:25,282 --> 01:08:27,149
-My husband's away on a
business trip.

825
01:08:27,174 --> 01:08:29,228
-Yeah. Ok, can I
have a look?

826
01:08:37,147 --> 01:08:38,147
Hands.

827
01:08:47,579 --> 01:08:50,447
No dirt under nails
or mud on her shoes.

01:08:55,001 --> 01:08:56,001
-Where?

831
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,774
-Far,
-Good Morning, sir.

832
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,197
Are you here alone?

833
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,727
-Good morning, officer.

834
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,462
No, I'm here with my partner.

835
01:09:04,157 --> 01:09:05,728
She's inside one of the stores.

836
01:09:05,753 --> 01:09:07,345
Shopping.
Right now.

837
01:09:07,712 --> 01:09:09,344
-Can I see your certificate, please?

838
01:09:11,002 --> 01:09:12,962
-My partner keeps it in her purse.

839
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:14,549
You see,

840
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:16,728
I am losing it
all the time.

841
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,236
-I see.

842
01:09:18,447 --> 01:09:21,111
And what store is
she shopping in?

843
01:09:27,926 --> 01:09:28,736
-Oh.

844
01:09:28,761 --> 01:09:29,761
Here she is.

845
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,595
-I'm sorry, darling.

846
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,307
They had such a huge variety

847
01:09:34,332 --> 01:09:36,011
of pain relief ointment,

848
01:09:36,216 --> 01:09:39,072
I bought you this one; I hope it's
 the one you were looking for.

849
01:09:39,201 --> 01:09:40,666
-That's wonderful, dear.

850
01:09:41,451 --> 01:09:43,572
Can I have my certificate, please?

851
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:46,035
-Of course, darling.

852
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,205
Would you like to
see mine also, officer?

853
01:09:48,656 --> 01:09:49,984
-No, that's Ok.

854
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:52,388
-Thank you, sir.

855
01:09:52,712 --> 01:09:53,938
You have a good day.

856
01:09:53,963 --> 01:09:55,595
-Thank you officer. You
have a good day.

857
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
-Madam.

858
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:58,461
-Sir.

859
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:04,818
-If I'm walking too
slowly just say it,

860
01:10:05,436 --> 01:10:06,611
and I'll pick up my pace.

861
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:08,429
-This pace is fine.

862
01:10:09,588 --> 01:10:11,593
Maybe don't squeeze
my hand so tight;

863
01:10:11,617 --> 01:10:13,462
my palm's getting
a little sweaty.

864
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,634
-Better?
-Yes.

865
01:10:16,088 --> 01:10:17,088
Much better.

866
01:10:18,557 --> 01:10:21,080
-Are you planning on buying
anything else nice for yourself

867
01:10:21,174 --> 01:10:22,494
while we're here?
-Yes.

868
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,720
Contact lens solution.

869
01:10:24,795 --> 01:10:26,298
and a Parker roller-ball.

870
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:29,767
-I didn't know you were near sighted.

871
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:33,163
I'm near sighted, too.

872
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:01,330
-Will you stay a few days?

873
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:03,712
-I'm afraid not, papa.

874
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:06,220
We're heading back again today.

875
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:09,001
Tomorrow I'm going away
 on a business trip.

876
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,384
You know how demanding my job is.

877
01:11:11,677 --> 01:11:14,681
Don't ask if I can stay
a few days every time I come.

878
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:18,736
-Do you all work
for the same company?

879
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,004
-Yes.
-Yes.

880
01:11:22,207 --> 01:11:26,173
-My daughter says me
it's very fine company.

881
01:11:26,339 --> 01:11:27,488
Do you agree?

882
01:11:28,427 --> 01:11:30,876
-It's a rather good company.
-It is.

883
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,848
-One of the best, I'd say.
-Hmm.

884
01:11:34,678 --> 01:11:36,009
-The only problem...

885
01:11:36,052 --> 01:11:38,158
with the job is that
I don't have enough time...

886
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:40,306
for my wife, and kids.

887
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,830
-We have four beautiful children.

888
01:11:47,425 --> 01:11:49,033
-Congratulations.

889
01:11:49,058 --> 01:11:50,587
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

890
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:57,111
But even if we never had children,

891
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:00,126
I would never dream...
of leaving my wife.

892
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,962
Even if it was just the two of us.

893
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:04,323
On our own.

894
01:12:04,917 --> 01:12:06,051
We'd go on trips.

895
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:09,025
We'd go to Portofino,
in Italy,

896
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:11,494
or go to Greek island,
for the summer,

897
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:13,267
and so our relationship

898
01:12:13,427 --> 01:12:14,694
would be as intense

899
01:12:15,114 --> 01:12:16,647
as it was at the start.

900
01:12:19,184 --> 01:12:20,184
I love

901
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,798
my wife so much.

902
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:24,759
I could die for her.

903
01:12:28,132 --> 01:12:29,931
That's how much I love her.

904
01:12:41,869 --> 01:12:43,955
-For your first day
in the city, you did great.

905
01:12:44,822 --> 01:12:48,026
That part about
holiday destination in the

906
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:49,832
Mediterranean was brilliant.

907
01:12:50,018 --> 01:12:51,418
-Thank you very much.

908
01:13:02,233 --> 01:13:03,787
When did you become near sighted?

909
01:13:05,696 --> 01:13:07,029
-When I was sixteen.

910
01:13:08,087 --> 01:13:09,978
You?
-When I was twelve.

911
01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:13,911
-What was the make
of your first pair of glasses?

912
01:13:15,966 --> 01:13:17,166
-I don't remember.

913
01:13:19,035 --> 01:13:21,112
-Do you have astigmatism, too?
-Yes.

914
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,319
-Would you like me to rub
some balm on your back?

915
01:13:33,897 --> 01:13:35,522
I wanna bet you can't
reach on your own.

916
01:13:38,366 --> 01:13:39,366
-I'd like that.

917
01:13:55,961 --> 01:13:56,961
-Here?

918
01:13:57,407 --> 01:13:58,626
-A little lower, please.

919
01:13:59,032 --> 01:14:00,627
-Here?
-Yes.

920
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,251
-Hello everyone, and
good luck.

921
01:14:32,646 --> 01:14:34,939
Your room numbers
are as follows:

922
01:14:35,084 --> 01:14:38,443
Room 306: the hotel
manager and her partner.

923
01:14:38,704 --> 01:14:41,267
They both...they both
have nice voices.

924
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:44,533
Room 240: couple who
both like to ski.

925
01:14:44,711 --> 01:14:46,000
Room 282:

926
01:14:46,025 --> 01:14:49,509
couple who both
studied social sciences.

927
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:51,173
Name of the yacht Bliss,

928
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:53,369
couple prone to nosebleeds.

929
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:06,728
-You and you take 306.

930
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,494
You and you take 240,

931
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,455
You take 282

932
01:15:11,156 --> 01:15:13,062
and you two, take the yacht.

933
01:15:13,273 --> 01:15:14,822
-Can I go to the yacht?

934
01:15:15,539 --> 01:15:17,406
-Ok, then, so you
take the yacht

935
01:15:17,964 --> 01:15:19,806
And you take 282.

936
01:15:20,509 --> 01:15:22,111
And...uh...
us three,

937
01:15:22,323 --> 01:15:23,720
we'll take the manager's room.

938
01:15:24,096 --> 01:15:25,563
We have forty minutes.

939
01:16:15,344 --> 01:16:16,344
-Wake up.

940
01:16:17,688 --> 01:16:18,688
Get up.

941
01:16:21,245 --> 01:16:22,642
Sit in that seat over there.

942
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:25,501
Put your hand behind your back.

943
01:16:27,655 --> 01:16:31,455
-A basketball weighs between
550 and 650 grams.

944
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,443
-Did you know that?
-No, I didn't know that.

945
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:36,123
-Yes.

946
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:40,239
The weight's different
for men's and women's games,

947
01:16:40,264 --> 01:16:41,963
but that's roughly
how much it weighs.

948
01:16:42,876 --> 01:16:45,071
Do you know how much
a volleyball weighs?

949
01:16:45,174 --> 01:16:47,174
-No. But I'd like to find out.

950
01:16:48,674 --> 01:16:50,619
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

951
01:16:50,751 --> 01:16:52,431
I have something to tell you.

952
01:16:53,087 --> 01:16:55,369
His nose doesn't really
 bleed on its own.

953
01:16:55,658 --> 01:16:56,963
He bangs it against
the wall,

954
01:16:56,988 --> 01:16:59,541
 or a piece of hard wood, or
something like that.

955
01:16:59,884 --> 01:17:02,173
Or he cuts it with a pen knife
when you're not looking.

956
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,133
You two are not suited.

957
01:17:04,732 --> 01:17:08,074
-Shut up. Dad, tell him to
leave, I'm sleeping.

958
01:17:08,209 --> 01:17:09,746
-And...and I'm quite sure

959
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:11,435
that stain on his t-shirt isn't blood,

960
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,619
but cherry juice or tomato
ketchup or red watercolor paint,

961
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,204
Or something like that.

962
01:17:16,229 --> 01:17:18,446
or beetroot juice.

963
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:21,900
-Do you love her?

964
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:25,204
-With all my heart.

965
01:17:26,804 --> 01:17:30,604
-How much to you love her?
On a scale of one to fifteen?

966
01:17:34,598 --> 01:17:35,598
-Fourteen.

967
01:17:37,231 --> 01:17:39,323
-Fourteen is a very impressive score.

968
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:41,869
-He loves her very much indeed.

969
01:17:42,817 --> 01:17:44,377
-Who do you think we should kill?

970
01:17:45,155 --> 01:17:47,658
Who will be able to live
on their own better?

971
01:17:54,684 --> 01:17:56,605
Here is the knife, mom,
kill him

972
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,276
-You better get out
while you still can.

973
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:02,033
-Ok...Ok...

974
01:18:03,622 --> 01:18:05,356
-That's all you came to say to me?

975
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,024
-You...

976
01:18:17,923 --> 01:18:19,448
If this woman dies,

977
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:21,658
Do you think you'll
manage it on your own?

978
01:18:21,683 --> 01:18:23,569
Or will you get involved
with someone else?

979
01:18:23,594 --> 01:18:24,222
-No.

980
01:18:24,962 --> 01:18:27,064
I.. I can live alone, she can't

981
01:18:27,854 --> 01:18:30,635
I'm on my own for hours
when she got out the hotel.

982
01:18:32,072 --> 01:18:34,604
I like sitting in the room.

983
01:18:35,018 --> 01:18:36,244
Relaxes me.

984
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:37,753
Calms me.

985
01:18:38,942 --> 01:18:40,008
I like it a lot.

986
01:18:42,683 --> 01:18:45,837
I can definitely live...
on my own.

987
01:18:46,872 --> 01:18:47,872
-Be quiet.

988
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:57,356
-Take it.

989
01:19:00,621 --> 01:19:01,621
Shoot her.

990
01:19:14,506 --> 01:19:15,506
-Help!

991
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:18,099
No! No!

992
01:20:05,661 --> 01:20:06,727
-Where were you?

993
01:20:07,457 --> 01:20:08,924
I was looking for you.

994
01:20:09,075 --> 01:20:11,424
-I was masturbating
behind those trees...

995
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:12,607
Over there.

996
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:16,228
-Why aren't you dancing?

997
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:18,336
-My leg's a little sore.

998
01:20:19,963 --> 01:20:21,072
-Did you dig your grave?

999
01:20:22,135 --> 01:20:23,135
-Not yet.

1000
01:20:24,183 --> 01:20:25,510
-I don't mean to pressure you,

1001
01:20:25,877 --> 01:20:28,174
or to ruin the mood
now that we're celebrating,

1002
01:20:28,385 --> 01:20:30,447
but at some point
you'll have to do it.

1003
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:33,079
Don't expect anyone else
to dig your grave for you.

1004
01:20:33,337 --> 01:20:34,516
Or to carry your corpse.

1005
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,595
We'll throw some dirt
over you, but that's about it.

1006
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,079
Tomorrow, find a spot you like,

1007
01:20:40,761 --> 01:20:43,854
where the ground isn't
too rocky and make a start.

1008
01:20:45,682 --> 01:20:48,033
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
-Thank you/

1009
01:21:00,917 --> 01:21:05,783
-As soon as his last patient left,
I entered his office and said to him:

1010
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:07,798
Honey, the dinner is ready.

1011
01:21:08,103 --> 01:21:10,103
However, I'm not sure
I can eat right now.

1012
01:21:10,557 --> 01:21:12,416
One of my front teeth hurts a lot.

1013
01:21:12,503 --> 01:21:14,088
Can you take a look,
please, dear?

1014
01:21:15,143 --> 01:21:16,642
"Yes, sure, no problem."
he said.

1015
01:21:17,002 --> 01:21:19,221
In a minute he turned his
head and took the drill,

1016
01:21:19,345 --> 01:21:21,112
and I shoved it to his chest.

1017
01:21:24,732 --> 01:21:27,239
-That story sounds really
interesting, but I have to leave.

1018
01:21:27,495 --> 01:21:30,190
I just remembered I left some
 batteries next to a tree down there.

1019
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,252
And the last thing I
 want is to lose them.

1020
01:21:32,573 --> 01:21:33,573
Sorry.

1021
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:44,735
-Did you...catch rabbits?

1022
01:21:45,596 --> 01:21:47,728
-No, someone brought me them.
-Who?

1023
01:21:48,072 --> 01:21:49,272
-A friend of mine.

1024
01:21:49,689 --> 01:21:51,267
-Do you want one?
-No.

1025
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:56,017
You don't need to accept
rabbits form other people.

1026
01:21:56,221 --> 01:21:57,799
If you need more rabbits, just ask.

1027
01:21:58,134 --> 01:21:59,734
And I'll bring you more.

1028
01:22:01,697 --> 01:22:03,994
Catching rabbit is difficult,
but I'll try to do better.

1029
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:06,533
There's not need for you
to be indebted to the others.

1030
01:22:07,128 --> 01:22:08,528
-Thank you very much.

1031
01:22:09,965 --> 01:22:11,738
-The man who brought
you the rabbits,

1032
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:13,795
is he nearsighted?

1033
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:15,380
-I don't know.

1034
01:22:15,918 --> 01:22:17,051
I don't think so.

1035
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,340
-Ok.

1036
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,801
-Is that a sparrow
up in that tree?

1037
01:22:33,965 --> 01:22:35,765
-I can't even see that far.

1038
01:22:35,895 --> 01:22:37,028
I don't think so.

1039
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:38,697
-Are you nearsighted?

1040
01:22:38,879 --> 01:22:40,213
-No.
-You're lying.

1041
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:41,868
-it's the truth.

1042
01:22:47,637 --> 01:22:48,972
-What...does it say here?

1043
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:51,450
- "Y K K"

1044
01:22:52,307 --> 01:22:54,958
-You knew that already.
All zippers say the same thing.

1045
01:22:55,402 --> 01:22:56,869
-I'm not nearsighted.

1046
01:22:57,308 --> 01:22:58,902
I don't understand why
you won't believe me.

1047
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,115
I can see really clearly.

1048
01:23:01,323 --> 01:23:03,557
I used to be a pilot.
-You're wearing contact lenses.

1049
01:23:04,511 --> 01:23:06,713
-I don't wear contact lenses
and I'm not nearsighted.

1050
01:23:07,004 --> 01:23:08,271
I swear.
-You are,

1051
01:23:08,504 --> 01:23:10,378
-You think I'm an
idiot and can't tell.

1052
01:23:12,808 --> 01:23:13,808
Let me see!

1053
01:23:16,988 --> 01:23:18,455
I wanna see your eyes.

1054
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:21,129
-Look up.

1055
01:23:22,059 --> 01:23:23,059
Look up.

1056
01:23:24,981 --> 01:23:25,981
Up, up.

1057
01:23:27,193 --> 01:23:28,193
Look down now.

1058
01:23:30,107 --> 01:23:31,107
Look left.

1059
01:23:33,395 --> 01:23:34,395
Look right.

1060
01:23:35,637 --> 01:23:36,637
Up again.

1061
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:45,380
-I'm sorry.

1062
01:23:47,051 --> 01:23:48,856
I thought you were trying to fool me.

1063
01:23:50,858 --> 01:23:51,858
I'm sorry.

1064
01:23:56,138 --> 01:23:58,497
For this synchronization
exercise, we have to

1065
01:23:58,522 --> 01:24:00,974
fully concentrate, because
we have to press

1066
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:03,380
play at exactly the same time.

1067
01:24:04,004 --> 01:24:05,958
-Why don't we just use one headset?

1068
01:24:07,316 --> 01:24:09,051
-Because that's the whole point.

1069
01:24:09,076 --> 01:24:10,420
This is an exercise for us.

1070
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:13,619
We have to be totally synchronized.

1071
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:23,189
-I'm ready.
-Ok.

1072
01:24:26,512 --> 01:24:27,512
5...

1073
01:24:27,747 --> 01:24:28,747
4...

1074
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:30,942
3...2...

1075
01:25:28,037 --> 01:25:30,521
<i>We developed a code so
that we can communicate</i>

1076
01:25:30,546 --> 01:25:32,834
<i>with each other even in front of the others</i>

1077
01:25:33,005 --> 01:25:34,911
 <i>without them knowing what we are saying.</i>

1078
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:38,747
<i>When we turn our heads
 to the left it means</i>

1079
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,193
<i>"I love you more than
anything in the world"</i>

1080
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:43,661
<i>and when we turn our heads to the right,</i>

1081
01:25:43,686 --> 01:25:46,544
<i>it means "watch out, we're in danger".</i>

1082
01:25:48,653 --> 01:25:51,621
<i>We had to be very careful in
the beginning not to mix up</i>

1083
01:25:51,885 --> 01:25:54,388
<i>"I love you more than
anything in the world" with</i>

1084
01:25:54,778 --> 01:25:56,771
<i>"watch out, we're in danger".</i>

1085
01:25:58,254 --> 01:26:00,418
<i>When we raise our left arm it means</i>

1086
01:26:00,817 --> 01:26:02,480
<i>"I want to dance in your arms",</i>

1087
01:26:03,353 --> 01:26:05,931
<i>when we make a fist
and put it behind our backs</i>

1088
01:26:05,956 --> 01:26:07,763
<i> it means "let's fuck".</i>

1089
01:26:09,554 --> 01:26:12,661
<i>The code grew and grew as time went by</i>

1090
01:26:12,686 --> 01:26:15,156
<i>and within a few weeks
we could talk about</i>

1091
01:26:15,181 --> 01:26:18,534
<i>almost anything without
even opening our mouths.</i>

1092
01:27:49,323 --> 01:27:51,583
-Stop it!
That's enough.

1093
01:27:51,736 --> 01:27:53,127
Show my parents some respect.

1094
01:27:53,152 --> 01:27:54,450
They're playing music.

1095
01:27:55,908 --> 01:27:56,908
-That's Ok.

1096
01:27:57,487 --> 01:27:58,487
-No, mother.

1097
01:27:58,768 --> 01:28:00,060
It is not Ok.

1098
01:28:01,034 --> 01:28:02,167
-Please continue.

1099
01:28:02,316 --> 01:28:05,677
-You want us to perform the
same piece or something else?

1100
01:28:07,089 --> 01:28:08,155
-Something else.

1101
01:28:32,168 --> 01:28:33,996
Didn't her parents
 play beautifully?

1102
01:28:37,349 --> 01:28:38,349
-Yes, they did.

1103
01:28:39,257 --> 01:28:40,390
It was wonderful.

1104
01:28:47,178 --> 01:28:49,389
<i>-We love each other
and we suit each other.</i>

1105
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:52,216
<i>And that's the reason why
we decided to leave the</i>

1106
01:28:52,241 --> 01:28:54,866
<i>woods and stay together
forever in the city.</i>

1107
01:29:04,449 --> 01:29:06,641
<i>Tomorrow,
during the hunt,</i>

1108
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:10,833
<i>we're going to disappear and
everyone will think we've been captured.</i>

1109
01:29:11,342 --> 01:29:15,262
<i>And that we're going to be turned
into dogs, or canaries, or something.</i>

1110
01:29:30,511 --> 01:29:33,549
<i>I think the first thing I'm
going to do when I get into the city</i>

1111
01:29:33,574 --> 01:29:35,088
<i>is buy a bathrobe,</i>

1112
01:29:35,113 --> 01:29:38,129
<i>and then we'll go to
a pool with a high diving board</i>

1113
01:29:38,184 --> 01:29:39,604
<i>perfect for diving.</i>

1114
01:29:39,793 --> 01:29:42,067
-"And we'll do lots
of different things together,

1115
01:29:42,308 --> 01:29:43,964
Serious things, not silly ones,

1116
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:46,753
like go for walks in the
park or playing the-

1117
01:29:47,268 --> 01:29:48,335
guitar together.

1118
01:29:49,178 --> 01:29:50,178
It stops there.

1119
01:29:50,888 --> 01:29:52,888
There's notes at the back, but
I don't think it's important.

1120
01:29:52,959 --> 01:29:53,959
Read the notes.

1121
01:29:56,346 --> 01:29:58,713
Portofino. Italian fishing village

1122
01:29:58,746 --> 01:30:02,169
and upmarket resort famous
for its picturesque harbor.

1123
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:04,751
Population: 439.

1124
01:30:05,697 --> 01:30:06,697
Beaches nearby:

1125
01:30:07,392 --> 01:30:08,392
Paraggi beach,

1126
01:30:08,704 --> 01:30:09,704
Camogli,

1127
01:30:09,767 --> 01:30:11,732
Chiavari and Lavagna.

1128
01:30:12,447 --> 01:30:13,447
Serifos.

1129
01:30:13,682 --> 01:30:16,021
Greek island located in the western

1130
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,029
Cyclades.
Where did you find that?

1131
01:30:19,099 --> 01:30:20,099
By the river.

1132
01:30:20,795 --> 01:30:22,575
Someone must've dropped it during the hunt.

1133
01:30:23,599 --> 01:30:24,599
Give it to me.

1134
01:30:25,982 --> 01:30:27,382
I'll take care of it.

1135
01:30:37,325 --> 01:30:40,521
-Can you imagine why you were brought
to such a quiet place today?

1136
01:30:48,371 --> 01:30:49,371
-No.

1137
01:30:50,473 --> 01:30:53,097
-Because I think it's the
perfect spot for your grave.

1138
01:31:41,992 --> 01:31:43,926
Now cover yourself with soil.

1139
01:31:44,493 --> 01:31:45,493
Use your hands.

1140
01:32:03,571 --> 01:32:04,837
Over your face too.

1141
01:32:04,984 --> 01:32:07,583
You wouldn't want your face
to get eaten by dogs, would you?

1142
01:32:35,211 --> 01:32:38,161
If you die before me, I'll
visit you as often as I can.

1143
01:32:38,876 --> 01:32:39,876
I promise.

1144
01:32:51,461 --> 01:32:54,484
-I think we should leave right now.

1145
01:32:56,004 --> 01:32:58,395
The three of us coming here in a sudden

1146
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:02,052
two, four...is
is very dangerous.

1147
01:33:03,294 --> 01:33:05,443
Why didn't we think of
that earlier?

1148
01:33:06,732 --> 01:33:09,552
Highly likely the doctor will suspect us,

1149
01:33:10,686 --> 01:33:14,450
I suggest that we leave the
first chance we get.

1150
01:33:15,748 --> 01:33:17,208
Right now, in a fact.

1151
01:33:18,624 --> 01:33:19,757
-Don't be afraid.

1152
01:33:21,358 --> 01:33:22,748
No one will suspect a thing.

1153
01:33:24,334 --> 01:33:26,794
I bet you weren't expecting the surprise.

1154
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:29,756
Isn't it wonderful?

1155
01:33:30,054 --> 01:33:31,255
-Yes, it is.

1156
01:33:32,489 --> 01:33:36,137
Still, I'd like a few days
just to think it over so that...

1157
01:33:37,075 --> 01:33:37,841
I can...

1158
01:33:37,872 --> 01:33:39,911
maybe have the surgery when

1159
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:41,997
we next come to the city?

1160
01:33:44,872 --> 01:33:46,427
-What's there to think about?

1161
01:33:46,951 --> 01:33:49,732
If it's better to see clearly
or to be nearsighted?

1162
01:33:49,873 --> 01:33:50,873
Is that it?

1163
01:33:52,154 --> 01:33:54,154
That's absurd. You
know that.

1164
01:33:54,662 --> 01:33:56,763
Anyway, this doctor is
the best there is.

1165
01:33:56,966 --> 01:33:59,497
And it's really very difficult
to get an appointment.

1166
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:02,302
I called him months ago
to get him to see you today.

1167
01:34:54,667 --> 01:34:55,667
-She's blind.

1168
01:34:56,605 --> 01:34:57,605
-Thank you.

1169
01:35:24,929 --> 01:35:26,923
-Throw down you knife
and stand up.

1170
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,727
-Why did you have to blind me?

1171
01:35:33,212 --> 01:35:34,904
You could have blinded him.

1172
01:35:35,494 --> 01:35:37,841
-I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1173
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:40,036
The drugs are messing with your head.

1174
01:35:40,525 --> 01:35:44,063
If I were you, I'd try to be
a little more braver about the whole thing.

1175
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:46,954
Now get up and give me your knife.

1176
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:49,755
Or I'll hit you and take it by force.

1177
01:35:51,141 --> 01:35:52,282
Here I come.

1178
01:35:52,384 --> 01:35:53,982
-I swear I'm going to kill you.

1179
01:36:06,778 --> 01:36:09,606
-Let go of my hair,
you're hurting me.

1180
01:36:29,298 --> 01:36:30,298
-Just think...

1181
01:36:30,430 --> 01:36:31,430
...that when...

1182
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,990
...someone goes blind...

1183
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:36,359
...one of the other senses...

1184
01:36:36,915 --> 01:36:38,048
...is heightened.

1185
01:37:14,548 --> 01:37:16,896
-You could also capture
a dog in the woods

1186
01:37:17,008 --> 01:37:18,638
and train it to guide you.

1187
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:21,536
Dogs can do that, you know.

1188
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:25,047
I'll help you capture a dog myself.

1189
01:37:26,321 --> 01:37:27,802
Now calm down.

1190
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:29,771
Well, I'm going to leave
you here,

1191
01:37:29,796 --> 01:37:33,036
and I don't think you'll manage to
find it on your own.

1192
01:37:47,050 --> 01:37:48,386
-Are you enjoying the view?

1193
01:37:50,416 --> 01:37:51,416
-Sure.

1194
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:55,721
-What happened to your hand?

1195
01:37:57,697 --> 01:38:02,021
-I was cutting a tree branch with
a knife and I cut myself by accident.

1196
01:38:02,046 --> 01:38:05,450
You look...handsome today,
did you get your hair cut?

1197
01:38:05,636 --> 01:38:06,636
-Thank you,

1198
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:08,490
No, I didn't get a haircut.

1199
01:38:08,650 --> 01:38:10,408
I'm going to get my hair cut today.

1200
01:38:10,916 --> 01:38:12,138
Look what I brought you.

1201
01:38:12,276 --> 01:38:15,732
-Oh, thank you so much,
I'm so hungry! I'll eat it right away.

1202
01:38:16,165 --> 01:38:17,836
-It's...a bigger flashlight.

1203
01:38:17,946 --> 01:38:19,232
-Oh, I'm sorry.

1204
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:22,404
It's so big I thought
it was a rabbit.

1205
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:25,024
-Huh.
-the biggest flashlight I've ever seen.

1206
01:38:25,127 --> 01:38:26,127
-Oh.

1207
01:38:27,556 --> 01:38:29,289
Are you ready for tonight?

1208
01:38:29,853 --> 01:38:30,920
-Of course I am.

1209
01:38:35,219 --> 01:38:38,000
I want to tell you something,
but please don't be angry.

1210
01:38:39,509 --> 01:38:41,069
-Ok, what's wrong?

1211
01:38:41,961 --> 01:38:43,422
-I can't see anything.

1212
01:38:44,806 --> 01:38:45,806
I'm blind.

1213
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,920
-What do you mean?

1214
01:38:49,337 --> 01:38:53,404
-There's not point in lying to
you, you'll find out sooner or later.

1215
01:38:54,618 --> 01:38:57,122
Our leader blinded me in the city.

1216
01:38:58,104 --> 01:39:00,724
She must have realized
that I love you and...

1217
01:39:01,212 --> 01:39:03,347
you love me...and..

1218
01:39:03,372 --> 01:39:06,466
that we were going to run
away to the city, Together.

1219
01:39:08,471 --> 01:39:09,471
I'm sorry.

1220
01:39:12,462 --> 01:39:13,929
-You can't see at all?

1221
01:39:15,689 --> 01:39:16,861
-No, not at all.

1222
01:39:19,095 --> 01:39:21,396
-And when you asked...
if I had my hair cut?

1223
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:25,547
-I was just saying that...

1224
01:39:27,821 --> 01:39:30,357
So you wouldn't realize I can't see.

1225
01:39:33,348 --> 01:39:34,348
I'm sorry!

1226
01:39:35,598 --> 01:39:36,598
-Don't cry.

1227
01:39:37,099 --> 01:39:38,966
Crying will make your eyes hurt more.

1228
01:39:43,004 --> 01:39:44,137
We'll find a way.

1229
01:40:01,986 --> 01:40:03,236
-What blood type are you?

1230
01:40:04,682 --> 01:40:05,682
-B.

1231
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:21,481
♫ From the first time I saw
her, I knew she was the one. ♫

1232
01:40:21,794 --> 01:40:24,888
♫ She stared in my eyes,
and smiled. ♫

1233
01:40:25,363 --> 01:40:28,357
♫ And her lips were the color of roses. ♫

1234
01:40:29,018 --> 01:40:32,768
♫ The grew down on the river,
all bloody and wild, ♫

1235
01:40:37,255 --> 01:40:38,255
You like berries?

1236
01:40:38,505 --> 01:40:40,692
Blueberries? Blackberries?
-No, no.

1237
01:40:43,606 --> 01:40:45,206
-Can you play the piano?

1238
01:40:45,982 --> 01:40:46,982
-No.

1239
01:40:54,709 --> 01:40:55,709
Plastic cup.

1240
01:40:56,232 --> 01:40:57,232
-That's right.

1241
01:40:57,896 --> 01:40:58,896
Very good.

1242
01:41:01,482 --> 01:41:02,816
Do you speak German?

1243
01:41:05,891 --> 01:41:06,891
-No.

1244
01:41:08,945 --> 01:41:10,678
-I could teach you German.

1245
01:41:11,844 --> 01:41:13,787
It would take at least a year
for you to be able to speak

1246
01:41:13,812 --> 01:41:16,248
the basics not fluently,
so there's no point.

1247
01:41:16,932 --> 01:41:20,430
You know, German is one of
the most difficult languages to learn.

1248
01:41:20,455 --> 01:41:23,091
Because its grammar
 is very complicated.

1249
01:41:26,858 --> 01:41:28,248
I've brought you something.

1250
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:31,920
Fish.

1251
01:41:32,507 --> 01:41:33,507
-Huh.

1252
01:41:36,784 --> 01:41:39,826
♫ on the second day,
I brought her a flower. ♫

1253
01:41:40,815 --> 01:41:44,205
♫ She was more beautiful than any
woman I'd seen. ♫

1254
01:41:44,339 --> 01:41:46,115
♫ And I said do you know ♫

1255
01:41:46,401 --> 01:41:47,971
♫ where the wild roses grow? ♫

1256
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:50,947
♫ So sweet and scarlet and free ♫

1257
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:59,159
-Kiwi.
-That's right.

1258
01:41:59,753 --> 01:42:01,346
10 out of 10 again.

1259
01:42:03,573 --> 01:42:05,040
Can I give you a kiss?

1260
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:12,166
-I can't thank you enough
for all the activities and games and...

1261
01:42:12,362 --> 01:42:13,924
for keeping me company, but...

1262
01:42:14,463 --> 01:42:16,604
you know we can't do this anymore.

1263
01:42:19,907 --> 01:42:21,782
Would you like to play
another round of

1264
01:42:21,807 --> 01:42:23,908
Touch, guess, think, win?
-No.

1265
01:42:24,291 --> 01:42:25,619
That's enough for today,

1266
01:42:27,432 --> 01:42:30,385
In any case...I've run out
of things to test you with.

1267
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:33,041
Maybe tomorrow.

1268
01:42:33,892 --> 01:42:35,846
Or...one of these days.

1269
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:37,358
-Tomorrow morning?

1270
01:42:38,119 --> 01:42:39,322
-Uh, we'll see.

1271
01:42:44,384 --> 01:42:46,103
-Bye.
-Bye.

1272
01:43:19,256 --> 01:43:20,322
-Good afternoon.

1273
01:43:23,144 --> 01:43:24,144
-How are you?

1274
01:43:25,122 --> 01:43:26,122
-Fine.

1275
01:43:27,685 --> 01:43:28,685
-I'm hungry.

1276
01:43:29,903 --> 01:43:32,315
You haven't brought me
a rabbit in days.

1277
01:43:33,904 --> 01:43:36,089
Or things for me to touch and guess.

1278
01:43:37,668 --> 01:43:39,002
-I've got good news.

1279
01:43:39,707 --> 01:43:41,173
I've had a great idea.

1280
01:43:42,644 --> 01:43:43,844
Have you a minute?

1281
01:43:45,027 --> 01:43:46,294
-What kind of idea?

1282
01:43:49,762 --> 01:43:51,051
-I raise my left foot,

1283
01:43:53,391 --> 01:43:54,434
I bring...

1284
01:43:54,546 --> 01:43:56,689
my elbow to my knee
and tap it twice.

1285
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,221
I bring my foot to my
knee and tap it three times,

1286
01:44:00,751 --> 01:44:02,001
I lie face down

1287
01:44:02,134 --> 01:44:03,134
and kneel down.

1288
01:44:04,289 --> 01:44:05,756
I touch my left cheek.

1289
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,119
And then lie face up.

1290
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:17,800
-You sure you're
prepared to do that?

1291
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:24,534
-Yes, of course I'm sure.

1292
01:44:25,452 --> 01:44:27,155
I wouldn't propose it otherwise.

1293
01:44:32,593 --> 01:44:33,593
-When?

1294
01:44:35,249 --> 01:44:36,249
-Tomorrow.

1295
01:44:43,063 --> 01:44:44,063
-Tomorrow?

1296
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:38,190
-We should speed up a little.

1297
01:46:42,002 --> 01:46:43,533
-I can't go much faster.

1298
01:46:44,193 --> 01:46:46,269
These pants are too tight,
I'm sorry.

1299
01:46:47,653 --> 01:46:49,526
It was dark and I
couldn't see clearly.

1300
01:46:50,334 --> 01:46:52,034
And I didn't have
time to try them on.

1301
01:46:53,161 --> 01:46:54,396
Sorry.

1302
01:46:56,715 --> 01:46:57,715
-Nevermind.

1303
01:47:01,538 --> 01:47:03,005
-There's a bus coming.

1304
01:47:27,925 --> 01:47:29,354
It was the hotel coach.

1305
01:47:30,362 --> 01:47:31,628
They didn't see us.

1306
01:47:57,783 --> 01:47:58,783
-Profile.

1307
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:10,550
Fingers.

1308
01:48:18,801 --> 01:48:19,801
Elbows.

1309
01:48:40,311 --> 01:48:42,260
-Would you like me
to show you my belly?

1310
01:48:42,285 --> 01:48:43,301
-No.

1311
01:48:44,069 --> 01:48:46,292
I...I remember your belly very well.

1312
01:48:49,762 --> 01:48:50,762
Smile.

1313
01:49:09,997 --> 01:49:11,655
Can I have a knife and fork please?

1314
01:49:11,758 --> 01:49:12,897
Not a butter knife.

1315
01:49:13,032 --> 01:49:14,633
Steak knife.
-Yes, sir.

1316
01:49:28,999 --> 01:49:29,999
-Thank you.

1317
01:49:39,597 --> 01:49:41,206
I'm going to do it with a knife.

1318
01:49:41,988 --> 01:49:43,737
-Do you want me to come with you?

1319
01:49:44,027 --> 01:49:45,560
-I'd rather you didn't.

1320
01:49:47,003 --> 01:49:48,003
-Don't worry.

1321
01:49:49,213 --> 01:49:50,407
It's strange at first...

1322
01:49:50,432 --> 01:49:52,071
but then you get used to it.

1323
01:49:53,401 --> 01:49:55,324
And your other senses are heightened.

1324
01:49:55,590 --> 01:49:56,760
Touch, for example.

1325
01:49:56,998 --> 01:49:58,576
-And hearing.

1326
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,050
I know.

1327
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,266
I won't be long.

1328
01:51:40,348 --> 01:51:41,527
-Thank you very much.

1329
01:52:33,610 --> 01:52:36,198
