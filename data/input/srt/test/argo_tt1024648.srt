1
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,007
<i>This is the Persian empire...</i>

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,368
<i>...known today as Iran.</i>

3
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,330
<i>For 2500 years, this land was ruled
by a series of kings...</i>

4
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,045
<i>...known as shahs.</i>

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,723
<i>In 1950, the people of Iran elected
Mohammad Mosaddegh...</i>

6
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,247
<i>...a secular democrat, as prime minister.</i>

7
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,683
<i>He nationalized British and U.S.
petroleum holdings...</i>

8
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,810
<i>...returning Iran's oil to its people.</i>

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,764
<i>But in 1953...</i>

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,568
<i>...the U.S. and Great Britain engineered
a coup die-tat that deposed Mosaddegh...</i>

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,724
<i>...and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.</i>

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,487
<i>The young shah was known
for opulence and excess.</i>

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,525
<i>His wife was rumored to bathe in milk...</i>

14
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,645
<i>...while the shah had his lunches
flown in by Concorde from Paris.</i>

15
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,445
<i>The people starved.</i>

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,970
<i>The shah kept power through his ruthless
internal police:</i>

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>The SAVAK.</i>

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,643
<i>An era of torture and fear began.</i>

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,322
<i>He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran...</i>

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,120
<i>...enraging a mostly traditional Shiite
population.</i>

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,084
<i>In 1979, the people of Iran
overthrew the shah.</i>

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,204
<i>The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.</i>

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,167
<i>It descended into score-settling,
death squads and chaos.</i>

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,126
<i>Dying of cancer,
the shah was given asylum in the U.S.</i>

25
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,726
<i>The Iranian people took to the streets
outside the U.S. embassy...</i>

26
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,486
<i>...demanding that the shah be returned...</i>

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,971
<i>...tried...</i>

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,291
<i>...and hanged.</i>

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,286
Based on a true story.

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,331
U.S. Embassy, Iran - November 4, 1979

31
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,490
The carnival's a little bigger today, huh?

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,924
Windows are supposed to be
bulletproof, right?

33
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,122
Well, they've never been tested.

34
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,763
You just need to finish
filling out this section here.

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,724
We can process your visa.

36
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,121
We need some security.
Yes, it's your responsibility.

37
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,486
They're over the walls.

38
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,411
We should all split.
I'm gonna close up my office.

39
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,401
Oh, my God.

40
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,522
Marines to Number One. Fall back.

41
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,207
- Can anyone hear me? We need help.
- I need police right now. Right now, goddamn it!

42
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,044
- Jesus.
- Can anybody hear me?

43
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,043
There was a breach.

44
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,885
Just burn everything! Burn it now!

45
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,771
All right, burn everything!
All the files, file cabinet, safe.

46
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,842
Let's get a cart over here. Burn it all.
Come on.

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,890
Burn everything!
Burn the classifieds! Everything!

48
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,089
<i>Don't fucking shoot anybody.</i>

49
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,011
<i>You don't wanna be the son of a bitch
who started a war.</i>

50
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,924
<i>They need an hour to burn the classified.</i>

51
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,007
I need you to hold.

52
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,210
If you shoot one person, they're gonna kill
every single one of us in here.

53
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,091
I'm telling you,
if we're going to go, we need to go now.

54
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,847
- Okay, we need to make a decision...
- Can we wait until the Iranian police come?

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,480
No, the police aren't coming.
It's been 45 minutes.

56
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,644
- How do you know?
- The police have abandoned their posts.

57
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,121
If the police are not coming,
then the army's gonna come.

58
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,641
The prime minister won't let
the embassy be taken over.

59
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,964
The prime minister may come tomorrow, but the
Komiteh are here today. So we have to evacuate.

60
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,242
Look at me. No one is coming.

61
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,445
Get the desk drawers. Everything.
Don't sort it.

62
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,967
Get it down to the incinerator in the vault!
Go, now!

63
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,043
Tear gas as a last resort only.

64
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,521
<i>I repeat: only if your life is under threat.</i>

65
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,130
In here, we are in America right now.
Outside, we are in Iran.

66
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,840
- It's on American soil...
- I'm not going out into that.

67
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,200
They're not safe here.

68
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,330
If they get caught applying for visas
to the U.S.?

69
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,410
Mark, we are in the only building
with direct access to the street.

70
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,331
- If we're going to go, then we need to go now.
- Yeah, I'm in.

71
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,931
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

72
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,048
- I'm going outside.
- Why?

73
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,685
To reason with them.

74
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,402
Open the door!

75
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,284
Open the fucking door!

76
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,004
You said you wanted to see the world,
right, Tom?

77
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,288
Let me in! Let me in!

78
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,730
Burn it all. Come on.

79
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,645
Get the safe, get the filing cabinets,
get it all.

80
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,561
All four drawers,
I want them shredded right now.

81
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,524
Not gonna shred fast enough.

82
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,246
Grab the visa plates!

83
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,884
All four! And anything else
you see out there.

84
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,844
When in doubt, just shred it!

85
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,966
We got 10 minutes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Everything!

86
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,527
Get the shredder.

87
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,250
There are no police.

88
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,086
Jesus.

89
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,044
Leave the building, go now.

90
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,282
Iranians go first.

91
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,090
Now, hurry!

92
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,530
Who has made this?!

93
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,484
It's done. They're in.

94
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,123
Okay, come on.
We gotta get off the streets.

95
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,850
This way. Up here to the left.

96
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,521
- These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
- Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.

97
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,845
STATE DEPARTMENT - 7TH FLOOR

98
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,963
You think the Soviets would put up with this shit?
They'd fuckin' invade.

99
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,051
We helped the guy torture
and de-ball an entire population.

100
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,441
- How many were there?
- At least 50. We're not sure.

101
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,648
- Schafer!
- You still haven't found Schafer?

102
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,961
No, I was screaming his name
because I was fucking him.

103
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,365
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

104
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:25,365
Come in.
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

105
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:25,400
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

106
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,983
<i>It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.</i>
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

107
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:27,001
<i>It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.</i>

108
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,600
<i>- I was told five.
- No, sir, apparently it's six.</i>

109
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,889
- What happened?
- Not clear. We know they escaped.

110
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:33,685
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

111
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,245
- Where are they?
- The Canadian ambassador's house.

112
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,121
- Do they stay put? Are we attempting rescue?
- Hold for the Secretary of State.

113
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,089
Yes. Is White House joining?

114
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,844
They claim the embassy
was a den of espionage.

115
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,802
We wish it was a fuckin' den of espionage.

116
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:44,605
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFES OFFICE

117
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,801
CI's got three people over there, they don't see a
revolution coming?

118
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,290
- Call it something other than intelligence.
- Hold for the chief of staff.

119
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,884
- Hodding.
- I'll call him back.

120
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,368
They're sticking to it.
No release till we expel the shah.

121
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,609
- Put him on a plane, then. Fuck him.
- He's half-dead and he's in chemo.

122
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,171
We took him in. He's ours now.

123
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,806
Great, so we'll take in any prick
as long as he's got cancer?

124
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,530
No, just the pricks on our side.

125
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,207
So all our other pricks on their prick thrones
know when they get thrown out on a rail...

126
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,563
...they won't get their fucking spleens
taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.

127
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,246
What about the six
who are with the Canadians?

128
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,291
We've got 60 in the embassy with guns
to their heads right now.

129
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,250
The whole world is watching the embassy.
They're safer than the six on the street.

130
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,562
Banisadr's saying it'll be over
in 24 hours.

131
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,640
We leave the six where they are.
I'll go brief the president.

132
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,086
All right, let's get to it.

133
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,767
<i>So far official comments about
the incident have been a model of restraint.</i>

134
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,884
69 DAYS LATER

135
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,127
A story is a story until people believe it.

136
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,970
And then that story is called the truth.

137
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,327
And the truth now is,
according to the White House...

138
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,763
...that 50 Americans are prisoners
in a 6th-century shithole...

139
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,890
...because this agency
missed the warning signs.

140
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,771
So now a subcommittee
wants congressional oversight.

141
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,763
Apparently, they wanna see
what they're buying.

142
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,082
I'm a covert exfiltration officer, sir.

143
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,806
If they see what I'm doing,
I'm not doing my job.

144
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,724
Well, the director's upstairs right now...

145
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,851
...sipping a lemon water,
crossing out 800 names.

146
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,850
That's not a story, that's the truth.

147
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,930
Exfiltration readiness freezes
until further notice.

148
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,451
And if assets require it?

149
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,125
Then we're not responsible.

150
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,681
What you're responsible for
is to sit at your desk...

151
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,929
...keep your mouth shut
and do your fucking job.

152
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,811
Can I count on you to do that?

153
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,846
Mostly we're gonna miss kicking his ass
in the office pool, but again...

154
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,651
This is the last white tiger right here.
He's a good man.

155
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,566
He's got a shitty drive swing,
but he's a good man. Heh. Heh, heh.

156
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,644
God bless. I... I just wanna say to Mikey...

157
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,486
Well, first of all, good luck doing less
in retirement than you did at work.

158
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,247
When you're fishing
down in the Everglades...

159
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,290
- ... trying to catch your next ex-wife...
- Ooh.

160
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,442
...don't you forget us at Langley.

161
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,484
Twenty-seven years this man
gave his country.

162
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,130
You know what this says.

163
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,044
This is a great American right here.

164
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,126
Give the outfit 27 years,
they give you a trinket with a bird on it.

165
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,570
Yeah, I just wanna say that,
yeah, we're gonna miss him.

166
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,563
He's... The Red Menace...

167
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,883
My dad was a Steelworker, local 43.

168
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,402
When me and my brother were young,
he'd take us to the Chrysler Building and say:

169
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,201
"Look at that. Your dad built that. "

170
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,008
You're supposed to be out in the country.

171
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,329
She wanted more time to think.

172
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,570
What are you telling the kid?

173
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,367
- I wanna thank everybody.
- He's smart. He knows.

174
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,404
But I don't wanna stand here
without taking a moment...

175
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,084
...for our 50 men and women
who can't come home, so...

176
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,844
<i>Iran's Revolutionary Guard
has rounded up a gang of terrorists...</i>

177
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,523
<i>...blamed for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.</i>

178
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,446
<i>It says security at Khomeini's home
now has been tightened.</i>

179
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,288
<i>This, by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran.</i>

180
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,520
<i>There is no change reported
in the hostage situation.</i>

181
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,488
<i>In this country, George Meany died
last night. He was 85 years old.</i>

182
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,931
Yeah.

183
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,610
Yes.

184
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,001
What?

185
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,201
<i>To begin with, of course...</i>

186
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,001
<i>...we wanted to learn about the hostages
held in the American embassy compound.</i>

187
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,568
<i>They may not understand what
their ordeal means to their countrymen.</i>

188
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,007
<i>But this nation, their nation, is outraged.</i>

189
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,042
<i>And we cannot really know what it is like inside the prison
that was once our embassy.</i>

190
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:29,608
C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS, VIRGINIA

191
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:31,642
<i>And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.</i>

192
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,290
<i>Actions of Iran
have shocked the civilized world.</i>

193
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,246
<i>Our embassy has been seized...</i>

194
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,406
<i>...and more than 60 American citizens
continue to be held as hostages.</i>

195
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,605
<i>The situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged in regard to the hostages.</i>

196
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,969
<i>NBC's situation in Iran has changed,
however.</i>

197
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,724
- Is he back there?
- Office.

198
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,645
What happened?

199
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,611
The six of them went out a back exit.

200
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,286
Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.

201
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,169
Canadians took them in.

202
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,368
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests. "

203
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,649
They haven't left the Canadian
ambassador's house since it happened.

204
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,047
- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- Too dangerous.

205
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,682
You got Revolutionary Guards going
door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

206
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,128
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.

207
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,770
What about the White House?

208
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,526
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

209
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,767
The Canadians are done.

210
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,743
They say they're bearing
too much risk. Their

211
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:36,631
foreign secretary corners
Vance in Brussels...

212
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,331
...and told him she wants
the six of them out.

213
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,006
- Who else knows?
- Just the families.

214
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,885
Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book...

215
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,924
- ... on everybody who worked there.
- Jesus Christ.

216
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,282
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

217
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,490
But now the bastards are using sweatshop
kids to reassemble the shreds.

218
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,361
And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.

219
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,124
And they'll know what they look like.

220
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,647
Standing room only
for beheadings in the square.

221
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,401
- Who's handling?
- State is coordinating in-house.

222
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,730
State?

223
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,169
- They don't do exfils.
- They do now.

224
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,806
They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

225
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,008
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

226
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,881
These people die, they die badly. Publicly.

227
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,042
State wants the blame, we'll give it to them.

228
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,843
What does he want me here for?

229
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,805
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

230
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,811
Okay.

231
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,725
This is Bob Pender from State O.S.

232
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,763
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

233
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,327
- Bob?
- Thank you.

234
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,171
All right.

235
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,209
Mark and Cora Lijek.

236
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,807
<i>Twenty-nine and 25. He's a consular officer,
she's an assistant.</i>

237
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,363
<i>Newlyweds. They only just got there
a couple months ago.</i>

238
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,681
No language skills or in-country knowledge.

239
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,208
Henry Lee Schatz.
Agricultural attaché from Idaho.

240
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,164
<i>A bit of an oddball, apparently.</i>

241
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,569
<i>He was there to sell
U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.</i>

242
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,327
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

243
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,369
<i>He's smart and a climber.</i>

244
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,601
<i>Speaks Farsi.</i>

245
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,604
<i>He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.</i>

246
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,088
Embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.

247
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,766
And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...

248
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,531
<i>...oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.</i>

249
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,564
They're in hiding at the Canadian
ambassador's residence.

250
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,526
Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have escaped.

251
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,805
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

252
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,604
We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.

253
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,081
A couple of rat lines
through the mountains...

254
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,566
...to the crossing near Tabriz.

255
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,610
Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.

256
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,330
We wait till the weather clears up...

257
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,848
...then deliver the six bikes, provide them
with maps to the Turkish border.

258
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,646
We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.

259
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,764
Or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.

260
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,807
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

261
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,405
Tony.

262
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,568
It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

263
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,161
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

264
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,727
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

265
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,245
State is handling the op.

266
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm sorry, who is this?

267
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,290
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.

268
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,011
Sir, if these people can read or add...

269
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,249
...pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

270
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,443
It's winter. You can't
afford to wait around till

271
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,430
spring so it's nice enough
to take a bike ride.

272
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,167
The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them...

273
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,290
...you send in a Moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.

274
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,284
- We've explored those options.
- They'll never get past airport control.

275
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,011
- Komiteh own the place.
- They could pose as reporters.

276
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,321
- The government issued 70-something...
- Seventy-four.

277
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,964
...visas for American journalists.

278
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,122
The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.

279
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,171
If they're caught with fake journalist creds,
it's Peter Jennings' head in a noose in an hour.

280
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,442
North American accents
gives us limited options.

281
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,642
So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

282
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,201
What about English teachers
at the international school?

283
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,051
It's a good idea, but that school's been
closed for eight months.

284
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,844
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

285
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,166
Six Canadians have been over there inspecting
crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.

286
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,846
We give them creds,
makes them look like Ag NGOs.

287
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,171
It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

288
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,004
Those kids are black.

289
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,890
Those are African kids.

290
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,249
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
- Are there starving kids in Iran?

291
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,085
I'm sure there's some skinny kids
in Iran, so...

292
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,084
- What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope. "

293
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,287
Hold on.

294
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,007
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?

295
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,246
What's in this picture?

296
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,681
- Tehran.
- Right. What's on the ground?

297
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,525
- Snow.
- Right.

298
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,929
So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?

299
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,682
Sir, exfils are like abortions.

300
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,524
You don't wanna need one...

301
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,524
...but when you do, you don't do it yourself.

302
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,124
You have a better plan?

303
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,531
No, sir.

304
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,760
<i>Whatever
the conflicting signals from Iran today...</i>

305
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,280
<i>...and for that matter, every day...</i>

306
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,444
<i>...about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies...</i>

307
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,361
<i>...the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demand:</i>

308
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,648
<i>The hostages must be freed.</i>

309
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,644
...claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them...

310
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,565
...it violates them for all nations.

311
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,102
<i>We demand extradition...</i>

312
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:38,485
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

313
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,480
<i>...of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the United States' support...</i>

314
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,887
<i>...has killed months-old babies
in the arms of their mothers.</i>

315
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,761
<i>He said if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages...</i>

316
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,606
<i>...the students will kill them all
and blow up the embassy.</i>

317
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,767
<i>Americans were outraged at Iran
and anyone Iranian.</i>

318
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,764
<i>Before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.</i>

319
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,684
<i>An Iranian flag was burned...</i>

320
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,686
<i>when anti-Iranian demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian consulate.</i>

321
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,083
<i>...also is what led to a decision
to scrutinize the visas of Iranians...</i>

322
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,124
They knew exactly what was going to happen.
They knew.

323
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,800
But I don't understand
what they should do now.

324
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,566
Send him back,
just to be tortured and killed?

325
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,087
I don't think that justice is the worst thing.

326
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,090
<i>When did people first tell you that torture
was going on in Iran?</i>

327
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,165
<i>They would never come to me and say,
"Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow. "</i>

328
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,086
<i>President Sadat of Egypt,
he calls you, Imam...</i>

329
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,561
<i>Forgive me, his words, not mine.</i>

330
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,921
<i>...a lunatic.</i>

331
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,084
Why didn't he have a choice?
Why do you think he didn't have a choice?

332
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,605
He would've been referred to as a barbarian.

333
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,491
That's why they're saying
that their current regime...

334
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,201
The shah did more for women's rights...

335
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,369
I think you'd better...
Please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.

336
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,764
<i>At one point,
the mob cornered one of the Iranians.</i>

337
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,362
<i>When he tried to protect himself,
this is what happened.</i>

338
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,325
<i>Just hit him again!</i>

339
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,007
<i>We're not gonna take it anymore!
We're sick of it!</i>

340
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,411
<i>America!</i>

341
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,209
<i>Even in our little community here, I mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.</i>

342
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,485
<i>They shouldn't even let those students
in that embassy there.</i>

343
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,803
<i>Just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.</i>

344
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,121
<i>I'm mad as hell.</i>

345
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,042
<i>I'm like the guy screaming on that movie
program in Network, you know? I've had it.</i>

346
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,164
<i>And if need be, I'll bear arms again.</i>

347
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,927
<i>Men who served in Vietnam
for what they believed was right are angry.</i>

348
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,728
<i>They're outlaws,
in my opinion. They're international outlaws.</i>

349
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,567
<i>And that's the Way it is
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.</i>

350
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,408
<i>- Hello?
- Buddy man.</i>

351
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,005
I'll get Mom.

352
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,690
I'm looking for you.

353
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,446
<i>- Did you do your homework tonight?
- Yeah.</i>

354
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,321
<i>- Good man. What are we watching?
- Battlestar Galactica.</i>

355
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,960
<i>- What channel is it on?
- Five.</i>

356
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,605
All right. Catch me up.

357
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,322
It's the best show in the world.
First thing, the bad guys are called Cylons.

358
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,610
<i>The metal guys, right?</i>

359
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,201
- Now, who's the guy with the cape?
- That's Starbuck.

360
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,681
<i>He shoots at Cylons and he always wins.</i>

361
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,207
Who's the little dog guy?

362
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,927
He's not a dog, he's a Dagget,
and his name's Muffet.

363
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,369
<i>No, Dad. That's Star Wars.</i>

364
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,011
Ian, I asked you
to turn the TV off 40 minutes ago.

365
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,010
<i>Hang up the phone.
I need to talk to your dad.</i>

366
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,207
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

367
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,682
<i>- Tony? Yeah.
- Hello.</i>

368
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,009
You know, when you keep him up at night...

369
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,249
...he falls asleep at school.

370
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,928
I'm sorry. I don't...

371
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,321
I miss him.

372
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,730
Well, we can figure out a time
for you to come see him.

373
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,561
I miss you too.

374
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,367
I know.

375
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,603
Uh...

376
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,203
Bye.

377
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,087
You there?

378
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,045
<i>This is the hill
my forefathers used to speak about.</i>

379
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,209
Okay. All right, we really have to
get started here.

380
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,362
Our NE's work something up on this?
David?

381
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,887
They would pose as teachers
from the international school.

382
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,003
We went through all that. It's boarded up.

383
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,050
- Suppose the airport guards don't know that.
- Suppose.

384
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,329
Suppose Heckle and Jeckle
go over and save them.

385
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,448
Hi. Sorry.

386
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,890
Have a seat, Tony.

387
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,004
They're a Canadian film crew
on a location scout for a science-fiction movie.

388
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,882
<i>Star Wars, Star Trek, whatever it is.
They need an exotic place to shoot.</i>

389
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,281
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.

390
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,561
We put it out there...

391
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,370
The Canadian producers put it out there.

392
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,644
...that we're looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

393
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,169
Then we go to the consulate and say,
"Hey, we wanna look at Iran too. "

394
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,928
I fly into Tehran, we all fly out together
as a film crew. Done.

395
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,289
Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.

396
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,489
This is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in Iran.

397
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,160
You wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

398
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,051
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

399
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,043
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

400
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,080
- No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.
- Chambers.

401
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,288
John Chambers.
He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy.

402
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,403
He's got an Oscar, he
did Planet of the Apes.

403
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,476
Did a bunch of contract
work for us in the past.

404
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,207
I go see him, he sets us up.
One, two days, make it look real.

405
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,405
I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you
give me a break? I can't breathe in this house.

406
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,564
- I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.
- Stay inside the fucking house.

407
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,604
- Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.
- That's not the point, Bob.

408
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,001
- It doesn't matter who saw you go out.
- Did you see me?

409
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,527
- No.
- I did, okay? I saw you.

410
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,684
Bob, it only takes one second
for them to spot you.

411
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,689
Some Americans are missing.

412
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,002
Look at the repaired list of embassy employees.

413
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,124
The numbers don't match.

414
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,204
Finish assembling the pictures from the embassy.

415
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,886
All I need is their faces and I will find them.

416
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,809
Yes, sir, it will be done.

417
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,525
We want you to go to L.A.

418
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,167
If you can make the movie thing credible,
we'll take you to the director.

419
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,047
Don't fuck up.

420
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,688
The whole country is watching you.

421
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,929
They just don't know it.

422
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,361
My creation.

423
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,524
My creation.

424
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,841
What the fuck, Brian?

425
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,246
- Cut.
- We're cutting.

426
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,607
- What an idiot.
- It really hurt.

427
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,006
I'm sorry.

428
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,130
Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!

429
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:38,091
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19, 1980

430
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,845
He says the Minotaur prosthetic
is too tight, so he can't act.

431
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,771
If he could act, he wouldn't
be playing the Minotaur.

432
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,365
Mr. Chambers?

433
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,445
Kevin Harkins.

434
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,725
Hey, Tony.

435
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,046
Watch your head.

436
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,125
What are you shooting?

437
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,164
Monster movie.

438
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,361
Yeah? Any good?

439
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,809
Target audience will hate it.

440
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,490
Who's the target audience?

441
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,250
People with eyes.

442
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,160
Talk to me.

443
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,485
It's an exfil.

444
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,801
From where?

445
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,411
Worst place you can think of.

446
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,971
Universal City.

447
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,489
How are you gonna get into the embassy?

448
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,008
They're not in the embassy.
During the takeover, six people escaped.

449
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,009
They're hiding out in Tehran.

450
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,489
- And that's who I'm gonna go get.
- What am I making?

451
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,323
I need you to help me make a fake movie.

452
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,000
Heh. You came to the right place.

453
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,363
I wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

454
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,522
- That we're not gonna make.
- No.

455
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,441
So you wanna come to Hollywood
and act like a big shot?

456
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,568
- Without actually doing anything?
- No.

457
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,324
You'll fit right in.

458
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,720
Let's see.

459
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,767
Well, this one's got an M.A. in English.
She should be your screenwriter.

460
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,844
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.

461
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,729
Here's your director.

462
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,042
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

463
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,561
You can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.

464
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,569
Look, if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

465
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,007
The Kho-maniacs are Froot Loops,
but they got cousins...

466
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,407
...who sell prayer rugs
and eight-tracks on La Brea.

467
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,528
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

468
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,842
You need a script. You need a producer.

469
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,201
- Make me a producer.
- No.

470
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,682
You're an associate producer at best.

471
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,409
<i>If you're gonna do a $20 million
Star Wars rip-off...</i>

472
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,406
...you need somebody who's a somebody
to put their name on it.

473
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,489
Somebody respectable.

474
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,926
With credits.

475
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,605
Who you can trust
with classified information.

476
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,807
Who'll produce a fake movie.

477
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,851
For free.

478
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,923
Hi. I only got a couple of minutes.
I'm getting a lifetime achievement award.

479
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,690
<i>Mazel tov, Lester.</i>

480
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,360
I'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

481
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,604
Okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people...

482
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,441
...all of whom chant "Death to America"
all the livelong day.

483
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,210
You want to set up a movie in a week.

484
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,807
You want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living.

485
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,440
Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here...

486
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,122
...into a country that wants CIA blood
on their breakfast cereal...

487
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,802
...and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

488
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,725
Past about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.

489
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,645
Right.

490
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,129
Look, I gotta tell you.

491
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,291
We did suicide missions in the Army
that had better odds than this.

492
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,930
Sir, the car is here.

493
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,569
You ever think, Lester,
how this is all for the cameras?

494
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,809
Well, they're getting the ratings,
I'll say that for...

495
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,603
We're gonna need a script.

496
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,682
Here, come on, come on, come on.

497
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,041
- No, it's fine.
- Stop.

498
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,371
Okay.

499
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,641
I love you.

500
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,568
Sahar, how are you doing?

501
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,005
Fine, thank you.

502
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,482
Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

503
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,326
All this time. They never go out.

504
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,409
Sahar knows.

505
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,202
<i>How about The Horses of Achilles?</i>

506
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,846
No good. Nobody does Westerns anymore.

507
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,164
- It's ancient Troy.
- If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.

508
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,407
Hey, Kenny, please.

509
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,922
Yeah, it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

510
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,566
It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.

511
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,247
If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.

512
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,007
<i>The cardinal wants
all cover options on his desk Friday morning.</i>

513
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,443
Engell's prepping the bikes option,
the teachers option.

514
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,922
You have 72 hours to make yours better.

515
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,606
Fine.

516
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,246
Hey, is AOO6 still on the open list?

517
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,887
Yeah, I'll hold.

518
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,405
"Fade in on a starship landing.
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe.

519
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,326
Women gather, offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

520
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,969
<i>Argo. A science-fantasy adventure. "</i>

521
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,329
- it's in turnaround. It's dog shit.
- It's a space movie in the Middle East.

522
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,130
- Does it matter?
- Can we get the option?

523
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,810
Why do we need the option?

524
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,851
You're worried about the Ayatollah?
Try the WGA.

525
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,091
Just let me do the talking.

526
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,523
I've known this guy for 25 years.
He's full of shit and he comes on hard...

527
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,364
...but I can handle him.

528
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,444
Come in, come in. Please, sit down.

529
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,489
Give my love to Ruthie, Lester.
How's she doing?

530
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,642
- She died.
- Ah, jeez. I'm sorry.

531
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,644
- Nine years ago.
- Well, you know how it is, Lester.

532
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,124
You know, we got a lot on our minds
in this business. $0...

533
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,681
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

534
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,524
Up like a carny ride.

535
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,721
One month, yeah.

536
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,287
- Who are you again?
- Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.

537
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,851
He's the money.

538
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,086
Look, what do you say 15 thou
and let's close on this?

539
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,804
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

540
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,440
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

541
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,090
All right.

542
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,966
I enjoyed your films. The early ones.

543
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,245
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

544
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,329
Thank you. Very respectful.

545
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,005
You're finished, Lester.

546
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,409
Get your cataracts fixed, read the trades.

547
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,171
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

548
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,800
They're screaming for sci-fi.

549
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,169
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

550
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,127
Well, what can I say?

551
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,924
Congratulations.

552
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,644
But, see, it kind of worries me,
what you said, and let me tell you why.

553
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,566
Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at
Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...

554
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,449
...when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.

555
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,682
He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

556
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,170
<i>Seems he was attached
to star in Zulu Empire...</i>

557
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,527
...which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.

558
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,763
But Warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget...

559
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,850
...because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

560
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,611
They may be Cannibals,
but they want health and dental...

561
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,086
...so the movie's kaput.

562
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,449
Which means that the MGM deal
ain't gonna happen...

563
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,444
...and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.

564
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,884
So the way it looks to me...

565
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,889
Through the cataracts, I grant you.

566
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,844
...is that you can either sign here...

567
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,004
...and take $10,000
for your toilet paper script...

568
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,401
...or you can go fuck yourself.

569
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,328
With all due respect.

570
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,125
You really know Warren Beatty?

571
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,041
Yes, I do. I took a leak next to him
once at the Golden Globes.

572
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,006
Taco?

573
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,521
Got any kids, Lester?

574
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,769
Yeah. I have two daughters.

575
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,400
You see them much?

576
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,530
I talk to them once a year.

577
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,648
- Maybe.
- Why is that?

578
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,128
I was a terrible father.

579
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,242
The bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.

580
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,688
You come home to your wife and kids,
you can't wash it off.

581
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,961
You?

582
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,770
Yeah, I got a son.

583
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,168
He lives in Virginia with his mother.

584
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,769
You're divorced?

585
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,769
Taking time off.

586
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,962
He needs to be, you know...

587
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,167
...where he is.

588
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,642
Kids need the mother.

589
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,120
<i>So tell me what's happening now.</i>

590
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,089
Dad, just turn on the TV.

591
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,931
I don't have the same channels
where I am, bud.

592
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,645
You gotta explain it to me.

593
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,201
There are these giant spiders,
and they're attacking all these people.

594
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,840
And these people have to fight
the giant spiders.

595
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,766
They're scared. They can't fight a spider.

596
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,082
<i>The thing about the spiders is,
they're from an inter-dimensional gateway.</i>

597
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,890
What is that? Like a black hole?

598
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,526
Yes, it is a black hole. I know all about it.

599
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,367
They caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

600
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,401
<i>Listen.</i>

601
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,928
Since the incident, the number of guards
at the airport has doubled.

602
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,010
Thorough background examinations
should be expected.

603
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,409
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet.
I need another week, Jack.

604
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,689
You don't have it.

605
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,721
We got an office.

606
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,842
We got business cards.

607
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,843
We got a poster.

608
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,048
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard,
that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.

609
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,163
Six people's lives depend on this.

610
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,605
It's not enough. If we're gonna fool
these people, it has to be big.

611
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,764
And it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

612
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,929
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

613
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,247
If you wanna sell a lie...

614
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,760
You get the press to sell it for you.

615
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,486
No, no, no. Press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.

616
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,611
Well, they got a bunch of actors,
they're gonna read from beginning to end.

617
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,609
They have costumes and everything.

618
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,521
No, no, no, I can't.
Variety has an exclusive on that.

619
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,883
Is there any way to make this
more Middle Eastern?

620
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,130
Mesopotamia? Egypt?

621
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,361
Iran.

622
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,121
Look, I can get you in, but you're
gonna have to promise me at least half a page.

623
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,409
No, no, this thing's an event.
It's gonna be a spectacle.

624
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,126
- Lester?
- Nina. You look fabulous.

625
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,361
You're doing the reading?

626
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,688
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

627
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,848
Great. I'll call you.

628
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,886
Keep that fucking space witch
away from me.

629
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,367
- You know her?
- I was married to her.

630
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,204
Oh, my God, Iraq is amazing.

631
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,481
Oh, we're shooting in Iran.

632
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,091
Iran with an N?

633
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,850
Yeah. We're very excited.

634
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,286
You ever watch the news?

635
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,209
What does the title refer to?

636
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,566
The Argo. You know, it's the thing.

637
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,484
Like Jason and the Golden Fleece,
or what?

638
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,563
No, no. It's the ship. It's the spaceship.

639
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,567
It goes everywhere.
It goes all throughout space.

640
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,361
So it's the Argonaut.

641
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,047
No.

642
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,328
- What does "Argo" mean?
- I don't know.

643
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,561
You don't know?

644
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,206
It means "Argo fuck yourself. "

645
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,051
Excuse me. May I have
your attention, ladies and gentlemen?

646
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,762
If our artists could settle in.
We're just about ready to begin the reading.

647
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,686
Argo, by Mary Ann Boyd.

648
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,047
"Fade in on starship landing.

649
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,765
Exterior, bazaar.

An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe. "

651
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,603
<i>The people working here are not diplomats.</i>

652
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,240
<i>In fact, as Imam Khomeini said...</i>

653
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,291
<i>...we have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.</i>

654
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,968
<i>All evidence proves
that these people are spies.</i>

655
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,806
In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful...

656
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,566
...our message to the awakened peoples
of the world:

657
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,491
At this time we want
to expose the hateful acts...

658
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,802
Our world has changed.

659
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,210
The fire of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

660
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,484
The ship is turning around.

661
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,125
Fire the thrusters!

662
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,721
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill anyone.

663
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,247
<i>...were completely unjustified.</i>

664
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,090
<i>They and all others must know...</i>

665
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,804
<i>...that the United States of America
will not yield...</i>

666
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,685
<i>...to international terrorism or to blackmail.</i>

667
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,566
Sir! We'll be crushed!
There's not enough time!

668
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,843
...are controlled by capitalists
and large oil companies.

669
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,482
The United States government considers
revolutionaries as terrorists...

670
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,527
...but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.

671
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,451
<i>"The story was told,
but there are infinitely more.</i>

672
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,484
<i>Three setting suns.
The princess's robes fall from her body. "</i>

673
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,524
<i>If we find his ship
we will find our chance.</i>

674
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,920
<i>Aboard the Argo lies
my hope, my hero, my husband.</i>

675
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,948
We will begin the trials
and carry out the sentences.

676
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:57,584
<i>You Wonder Where and how this
seemingly endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

677
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,165
EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980

678
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,080
<i>What do they want? They say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"</i>

679
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,491
<i>The answer to that is clear.
They want their former shah.</i>

680
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,920
<i>...Carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.</i>

681
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,284
Carter and his government have given
asylum to the worst criminal of all.

682
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,487
<i>For life?</i>

683
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,048
<i>They will remain until the shah is returned.</i>

684
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,847
<i>But if the exiled shah,
now in a New York City hospital...</i>

685
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,163
<i>...leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran...</i>

686
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,567
<i>...harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.</i>

687
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,491
<i>"We out outside to the Shidoori Dome...</i>

688
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,483
<i>...holding on a single red flower...</i>

689
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,087
...as it grows from the ruins
of a starship in the desert.

690
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,847
Fade to black. " The end.

691
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,089
- Hello.
- Hey.

692
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,489
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

693
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,646
How you doing?

694
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,600
<i>- Good. You sound good.
- I am.</i>

695
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,086
It's like, we might be
doing something good.

696
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,926
You know, we're having his birthday party
at a bowling alley.

697
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,564
So you should come.

698
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,283
- When is it?
- On his birthday.

699
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,046
<i>I see. Nice choice.</i>

700
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,204
I just didn't know if it was a weekend, or...
But that's fine.

701
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,681
Okay, I might come. I'll try.

702
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,207
Don't try, Tony. Just come.

703
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,922
Hey, did you brush your teeth?

704
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,129
I gotta go enforce this.

705
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,206
Okay. Go enforce. I'll talk to you soon.

706
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,166
Huh.

707
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,966
<i>- Well, why'd he do it?
- He did it because he did it.</i>

708
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,967
He saw a covert intelligence officer
saying "cheese" with R2-D2.

709
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,285
They're going with the teachers.

710
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,442
It's a fucking death sentence, Jack.

711
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,371
Well, then it's on Engell.

712
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,767
It's done, Tony. Wash your hands.

713
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,170
Listen, I've done 30 movies.

714
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,324
Half of them, the pricks upstairs
tried to shut down.

715
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,766
Not this one.

716
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,045
My ass is staying right here
and I'm gonna run a movie company.

717
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,484
Hey. First shot of the picture.

718
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,086
Argo fuck yourself.

719
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,648
Argo fuck yourself.

720
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,121
How'd you get around the pricks upstairs?

721
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,725
How'd you get the meeting?

722
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,685
I went over D. Op's head.

723
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,360
And I used your name.

724
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,286
You can forget about that time-share
in Ocean City, Jack.

725
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,843
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
JANUARY 25, 1980

726
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,962
<i>Brace yourself. It's like talking to
those two old fucks on The Muppets.</i>

727
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,726
Aliens and robots?

728
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,645
Yes, sir.

729
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,522
You're telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now...

730
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,489
...that is funded by the CIA?

731
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,281
Yes, sir.

732
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,207
- What's wrong with the bikes again?
- We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

733
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,011
You think this is more plausible
than teachers?

734
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,528
Yes, we do.
One, there are no more foreign teachers in Iran.

735
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,927
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people.

736
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,648
Everybody knows they'd shoot in Stalingrad
with Pol Pot directing if it would sell tickets.

737
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,081
There are only bad options.

738
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,770
It's about finding the best one.

739
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,762
You don't have a better bad idea than this?

740
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,685
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

741
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,887
By far.

742
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,205
The United States government has just
sanctioned your science-fiction movie.

743
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,367
Thank you, sir.

744
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,721
I'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

745
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,561
Barely claim me as it is.

746
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,484
Your "in case of's" good?

747
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,090
It's just Christine.

748
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,962
I should've brought some books
to read in prison.

749
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,167
No.

750
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,842
They'll kill you long before prison.

751
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,001
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.

752
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,367
Studio Six.

753
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,763
We got a green light. Keep the office
running until you hear otherwise.

754
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,361
Argo fuck yourself.

755
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,247
Argo fuck yourself.

756
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,121
It's getting kind of late. Is he gonna show?

757
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,004
Some people have it worse.

758
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,487
Some people have it better.

759
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,169
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

760
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,847
<i>This is the final boarding call
for British Airways Flight 87.</i>

761
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,884
<i>"We are a nation of 35 million.</i>

762
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,040
And many of these people are looking
forward to martyrdom. "

763
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,567
- Hey.
- Hey.

764
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,651
Come to bed.

765
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,801
In five minutes.

766
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,007
You know, she pleaded with me.

767
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,048
When it started in the streets
nine months ago...

768
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,560
...she begged for us to leave.

769
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,564
She packed our bags, and I said:

770
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,923
"You know what?
You know, just a little bit longer. "

771
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,322
And all I was thinking was:

772
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,045
"Stay.

773
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,849
This is good for me.

774
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,450
Stay.

775
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,084
Show Newsom you got the balls. "

776
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,764
I can't believe I put Kathy in this position.

777
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,687
I think we're gonna die here.

778
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,044
<i>- Hello.
- Christine, hi. Jack O'Donnell.</i>

779
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,210
Tony wanted me to let you know
that he's gonna...

780
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,728
Gonna be away and won't be able
to call you for a while.

781
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,127
Where's he going?

782
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,004
Jack, is he safe?

783
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,369
Yes. Of course, he's safe.

784
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,285
You should've stopped after "yes. "

785
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:11,854
ISTANBUL, TURKEY - JANUARY 27, 1980

786
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,683
"Iran is 100 percent
not in a prerevolutionary state. "

787
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,929
CIA brief, November 1st, 1979.

788
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,082
Can't be right all the time.

789
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,761
Kevin.

790
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,446
When'd you get back?

791
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,887
The shah escaped in a 747...

792
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,448
...so laden with gold bars,
it nearly didn't make it off the runway.

793
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,647
But you kept busy.

794
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:56,840
Ferrying out the torture apparatus
of our friend's fallen dictatorship.

795
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,810
It's getting worse.

796
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,930
Everyone who lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

797
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,966
That slip makes a copy to the one underneath.
Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.

798
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,685
When you leave, they match them up...

799
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,247
...to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

800
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,371
So if they look, they'll see I didn't come
into the country with six people.

801
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,849
If they look.

802
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,926
When you land, you should go straight to
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance...

803
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,531
...to kiss the ring.

804
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,929
Get on record as having applied
for a film permit.

805
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,847
If they catch you later, at least they'll be
confused while they're torturing you.

806
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:41,777
IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

807
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,688
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

808
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,209
Uh, film production. Business.

809
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,370
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

810
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,606
I would've loved to, except my boss
didn't send a telex till I got here.

811
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,847
Guy had an intelligent thought in his head,
it would die of loneliness.

812
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,531
<i>The Times and AP found out six escaped.</i>

813
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,048
They know who they are and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

814
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,009
Somebody with one of the families talked.

815
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,531
Mother of God.

816
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,485
Yeah, I just put Vance on a plane
to take the editors to Le Cirque.

817
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,126
He thinks he can
get them to sit on it, for now.

818
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,088
Your guy better get them...

819
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,649
...and get the hell out.

820
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,410
The captain has informed
us that we have entered Iranian airspace.

821
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,043
<i>We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.</i>

822
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,924
This film crew is just yourself?

823
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,450
No, we have six more from Canada
meeting us today.

824
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,443
You like to film at the bazaar?

825
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,763
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

826
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,204
Landmark sites.

827
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,010
I see.

828
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,689
The exotic Orient.

829
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,488
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

830
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,290
You came to us at a complicated time.

831
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,445
Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie
theaters in Tehran were showing pornography.

832
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,840
I understand.

833
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,203
The function of this office is purification...

834
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,643
...as well as promotion for the arts.

835
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,566
I'll review this for the minister.

836
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,725
Okay. Thank you.

837
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,925
Lester, you're working late.

838
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,009
Till the dawn's early light.

839
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,046
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

840
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,124
Well, I'm 150 years old,
so you wouldn't be me for long.

841
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,202
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Ken Taylor.

842
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,885
Thank you for what you're doing.

843
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,524
I was expecting more of a G-man look.

844
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,602
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

845
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,721
Ah. This way.

846
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,561
- These are blank, you know. Stamps...
- Yeah, I'll take care of this.

847
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,886
How long?

848
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,930
A day, prep their covers.
Two if they need it.

849
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,411
And you'll fly out with them?

850
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,444
Yeah.

851
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,290
There's something you should know.

852
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,723
We think our housekeeper
has figured out who they are.

853
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,763
We don't know if we can trust her,
so sooner is better.

854
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,926
Hi.

855
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,969
My name's Kevin Harkins...

856
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,644
...and I'm gonna get you home.

857
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,726
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

858
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,806
It's theater of the absurd.

859
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,571
- What are our chances?
- Your chances are good.

860
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,849
"Good"? Well, what's the number value
of "good"?

861
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,811
Thirty percent chance
of being publicly executed?

862
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,487
Can you tell me what the objection was
to normal cover identities?

863
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,921
There are no Canadians in the country
for normal reasons.

864
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,565
- They'll sniff us out regardless.
- The Swedish Consul?

865
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,401
They accused him of being an American
at the airport. They held him for an hour.

866
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,649
We can't hold up under that.
We don't know what the hell movie people do.

867
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,926
That's why I'm here.

868
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,607
I'm gonna help you. I'll be with you
the whole way. This is what I do.

869
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,808
Have you gotten people out
this way before?

870
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,650
This would be a first.

871
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,721
Do you know that every day they catch
another friend of the shah at the airport?

872
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,400
Kangaroo trials and then firing squads...

873
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,331
...just for having American names
in their phone books.

874
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,970
You've been here an hour.

875
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,521
And you're asking us to trust you
with our lives, Mr...?

876
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,051
Harkins.

877
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,049
That's your real name?

878
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,881
No.

879
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,640
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

880
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,849
But it is time to go.

881
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,927
We've got orders to close the embassy
and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.

882
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,161
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport. I'm serious.

883
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,245
No, no, no, this is what, the part when
we say this is so crazy it might actually work?

884
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,243
Joe, I saw it in Burma. They get people out.

885
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,643
Snitches in banana republics?
They get them over the border after the coup.

886
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,841
That's your opinion, Joe.

887
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,202
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

888
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,810
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. That's execution.

889
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,526
- You got a problem lying, Joe?
- Point is, we can't stay here.

890
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,841
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?

891
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,606
Pat and I have discussed it.
It's the risk we took.

892
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,290
That man out there
has got bad cards and he is going to lose.

893
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,768
And if he loses, it's our lives.

894
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,042
And his life too.

895
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,403
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

896
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,766
We gotta go.

897
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,727
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

898
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,446
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

899
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,524
Who you are, what you are,
where you've been. Complete bio.

900
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,801
And then add to that.

901
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,362
Where do you vacation? What are your
allergies? Who'd you have an affair with?

902
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,721
The only way this works...

903
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,521
...is if you believe that you're these people
so much that you dream like them.

904
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,204
Get started tonight.

905
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,924
I'll be back tomorrow.
We'll get going. Good luck.

906
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,249
Well, my guy kind of sucks.

907
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,765
What's your name?

908
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,767
Mike McEwan, eh? Heh.

909
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,767
That was convincing.

910
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,610
Kathy, what's your name?

911
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,809
<i>The Love Boat
will be seen 15 minutes from now.</i>

912
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,760
<i>The State Department insisted today
that the crisis in Afghanistan...</i>

913
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,050
<i>...will not divert the attention of the
United States from the plight of the hostages.</i>

914
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,885
<i>- -is perceived to be if not impotent,
then at least reluctant...</i>

915
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,563
<i>Now the United States finds itself in such
bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union...</i>

916
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,570
<i>...over that country's invasion
of Afghanistan...</i>

917
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,201
<i>The United States
is now moving toward a decision...</i>

918
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,408
<i>...to boycott the Summer Olympics
in Moscow...</i>

919
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,809
Bad news, bad news.
Even when it's good news, it's bad news.

920
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:37,290
John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.

921
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,447
<i>"The Minister of Culture and Guidance
has approved your location scout.</i>

922
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,529
He will send his representative to meet
you and your crew...

923
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,281
...at the Khayyam entrance
to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p. m. "

924
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,321
They called your bluff.

925
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,091
- Maybe they're cooperating.
- Absolutely not.

926
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:24,889
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. It's the hive.

927
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,405
Seven Canadians, Jack.

928
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,689
<i>Never give them multiple shots at a cover.</i>

929
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,686
Are they even ready?

930
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,080
They're getting there.

931
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,805
There's no prize for "Most improved. "

932
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,685
I don't have a choice.
We say no, they show up at the residence...

933
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,561
...and drag everyone out.
You think their covers are gonna hold up...

934
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,483
...when they're getting their fingernails
pulled out?

935
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,528
You want us to go to the Grand Bazaar
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

936
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,604
You said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.

937
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,410
They suspect something?

938
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,325
What I know is,
we need to pretend to be a movie crew.

939
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,882
We go to the bazaar today,
we fly out from the airport tomorrow.

940
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,411
We won't do it.

941
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,931
He told them that there were six of us.
So they're expecting six.

942
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,287
It would be suspicious
not to show up at this point.

943
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,568
What else do we have to do, all right?

944
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,286
He's about to show them
the only cards that we're holding...

945
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,126
- ... which is that they don't know we're here!
- That's the ball game, okay?

946
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,408
Look, we don't have any other choice!

947
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,921
Who says that we'll know our covers
well enough?

948
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,844
We're not in the CIA.

949
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,610
It's suicide.

950
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,842
I'm asking you to trust me.

951
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,441
I don't trust you.

952
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,531
This is the game, Joe.
What world are you living in?

953
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:01,321
The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob.

954
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,566
It's too dangerous.
I won't bring my wife into the bazaar.

955
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,005
ANDERS Joe?

956
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,529
So we'll see you at 2.

957
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:44,486
So don't be recognizable
but look exactly like your passport photo.

958
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,200
I haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.

959
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,082
Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.

960
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,409
Sorry. Okay.

961
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,491
Hello?

962
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,685
Hello?

963
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,481
Hello?

964
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,686
Who was that?

965
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,729
- Mark?
- Yeah?

966
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,610
I'm scared.

967
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,200
It's okay.

968
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,241
Where are they?

969
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,765
In the kitchen.

970
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,127
This is what I do. I get people out.

971
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,484
And I've never left anyone behind.

972
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,521
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

973
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,962
My name is Tony Mendez.
I'm from New York.

974
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,851
My father worked construction.
My mother teaches elementary school.

975
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,407
I have a wife and a 10-year-old son.

976
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,482
You play along with me today,
I promise you, I will get you out tomorrow.

977
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,609
Fuck.

978
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,049
Shit.

979
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,570
Hang on.

980
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,364
You all right?

981
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,802
Okay. Tell me who you are.

982
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,761
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

983
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,527
Robert Baker, director.

984
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,962
Timothy Harris, location manager.

985
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,128
Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

986
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,049
Rachel Dewart, production designer.

987
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,009
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

988
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,686
All right. Let's go make a movie.

989
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,002
Welcome, welcome.
My name is Reza Bolhani.

990
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,527
- Kevin Harkins. I'm the producer.
- Nice to meet you.

991
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,324
This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman.

992
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,727
This is Tim.
This is Mary, our screenwriter.

993
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,370
And this is our director, Bob Baker.

994
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,289
- You are the director?
- Yes.

995
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,926
Is this film a foreign-bride film?

996
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,126
Sorry?

997
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,766
A film where a foreign bride comes to Iran...

998
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,481
...but she doesn't understand the language
or the customs...

999
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,211
...and there is misunderstandings
and laughs.

1000
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,805
Oh, no.

1001
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:29,490
The bazaar in Tehran
is one of the largest in the world.

1002
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,244
This bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

1003
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,644
You can find many items
such as paper, spices...

1004
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,320
...precious metals, all right here.

1005
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,726
Right this way, please.

1006
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,491
This way.

1007
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,846
- Uh, Mike?
- Yeah.

1008
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:10,204
If I was to say you're looking through the
wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right?

1009
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,084
Yup.

1010
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,406
Just a little further.

1011
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,643
Please wait here. Let's stay together.

1012
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,209
He wants the photograph you took.

1013
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,483
It's okay, it's her job to take photographs.
She's the production designer.

1014
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,883
He says he did not give you permission
to take a photograph of his store.

1015
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,731
That's okay. You can tell him he can have it.

1016
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,122
Please, please, just take the photograph.

1017
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,080
Peace be upon you.

1018
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,485
And upon you, sir. Welcome.

1019
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,920
I hope you are well.

1020
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,764
Thank you very much. How are you?

1021
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,327
I'm very well. What's your name?

1022
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,681
Sahar.

1023
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,843
He's saying that the shah killed his son
with an American gun.

1024
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,887
No, no, no! No! Canada!

1025
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,127
Canada!

1026
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,567
I would like to suggest that we end our visit.

1027
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,001
You know, sister...

1028
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:31,165
...those who are with him, Rasool of Allah,
we are tender among ourselves.

1029
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,885
But stern against the Kufar.

1030
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,931
As God wills it.

1031
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,769
But those who sit silently have sinned.

1032
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,242
How else may I help, sir?

1033
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,721
No, no, just one thing.

1034
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,250
How long have they been here?

1035
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,527
Pardon?

1036
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,562
The guests of the Ambassador.

1037
01:21:54,563 --> 01:21:56,883
The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

1038
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,410
They arrived two days ago.

1039
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:05,922
Forgive my intrusion, one must be vigilant.

1040
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,090
Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran.

1041
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,085
How'd it go?

1042
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,324
What about tomorrow?

1043
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,205
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

1044
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,441
<i>For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround...</i>

1045
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,648
<i>...one week after humiliation in Illinois.</i>

1046
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,086
<i>I love New York.</i>

1047
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,006
<i>And I love Connecticut too.</i>

1048
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,806
<i>How did he win here? Well, he had help.</i>

1049
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,608
<i>I'm responsible for anything
that goes wrong in this government.</i>

1050
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,805
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

1051
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,969
When he runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

1052
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,926
The six with the Canadians
are coming out.

1053
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,564
Who signed off on this?

1054
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,530
- You. Where was your passport issued?
- Vancouver.

1055
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,966
- Where were you born?
- Toronto.

1056
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,128
"Torono. " Canadians don't pronounce the T.

1057
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,721
Some Komiteh guard
is actually gonna know that?

1058
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,680
If you're detained for questioning, they will
bring in someone who knows that. Yes.

1059
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:54,083
Mary, who were the last three prime ministers
of Canada?

1060
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,046
Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

1061
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,884
- What's your father's name?
- Howard.

1062
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,769
- What's his occupation?
- Fisherman.

1063
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,201
- Where were you born?
- Halifax, Nova Scotia.

1064
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,124
What's your date of birth?

1065
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,442
February 21st, 1952.

1066
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,569
- Good. What's your job on the movie?
- Producer.

1067
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,491
<i>- Associate. Last movie you produced?
- High and Dry.</i>

1068
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,170
- Who paid for that?
- CFDC.

1069
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,681
What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?

1070
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,569
- Leon?
- Shoot him. He's an American spy.

1071
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:24,001
Look, they're gonna try to break you, okay?
By trying to get you agitated.

1072
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,328
You have to know your résumé
back to front.

1073
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,732
You really believe your
little story's gonna make

1074
01:24:28,758 --> 01:24:30,829
a difference when there's
a gun to our heads?

1075
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,883
I think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

1076
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,287
Okay.

1077
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,450
Hey, they made it through
the location scout.

1078
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,085
You have a call.

1079
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,041
What is it?

1080
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,321
Go to black on green.

1081
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,121
Go.

1082
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,725
<i>- It all just changed.
- What?</i>

1083
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,491
<i>- They're calling the game. You gotta come back.
- What?</i>

1084
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:25,371
Joint Chiefs are planning
a military rescue of the hostages.

1085
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,091
<i>Delta Force has started training
to storm the grounds.</i>

1086
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,129
<i>So if the six of them...</i>

1087
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,921
...are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.

1088
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,481
Fuck. Goddamn it. I never would have exposed
them if I wasn't authorized to get them out.

1089
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,371
- It's over, Tony.
- If they stay here, they will be taken.

1090
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:46,242
- Probably not alive.
- Listen to me. The thinking has changed.

1091
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:50,081
Six Americans get pulled out
of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed...

1092
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,203
...it's a world outrage.

1093
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,330
Six Americans get caught playing
movie make-believe...

1094
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,165
...with the CIA at the airport and executed?

1095
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:03,201
It's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

1096
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,011
We're responsible for these people.

1097
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,810
What we are is required to follow orders.

1098
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,045
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1099
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,805
Fuck!

1100
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,687
Come in.

1101
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,890
Ready to try again.

1102
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,891
You're ready. You worked hard.

1103
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,924
Probably the best thing to do for you
right now would be...

1104
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,251
...just to relax.

1105
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,127
Okay.

1106
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,125
You did good.

1107
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,326
Thanks.

1108
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,008
Scorched-earth policy tonight.

1109
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,563
Nothing gets left.

1110
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,125
So you know.

1111
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,686
ExtAff wants you to burn the passports
before you leave.

1112
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,885
If we tell them now, they'll panic.
I think it's best if you just don't show.

1113
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,408
It was always a fucked mission.

1114
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,367
You came closer than anybody else.

1115
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:49,360
<i>If it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to break</i>

1116
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:03,723
<i>When the levee breaks
I'll have no place to stay</i>

1117
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,684
A little closer. Keep going.

1118
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,242
Now. Stop.

1119
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,484
Nope.

1120
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,407
- Yeah.
- It's from Dad.

1121
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,960
Here, look.

1122
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,562
Here you go.

1123
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:44,005
Ahern. It's off.
They want us to pack up the office.

1124
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,848
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

1125
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,083
He's late.

1126
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,567
O'Donnell.

1127
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,960
Somebody's responsible...

1128
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,003
...when things happen, Jack.

1129
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,210
I'm responsible.

1130
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:38,006
- I'm taking them through.
- Tony?

1131
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:52,323
Alan. Alan. We need to confirm those
seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

1132
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,807
- N.E. shut that down.
- I say it's back on.

1133
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,725
- I can't do it. It's backstopped.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1134
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,884
What the hell you talking about, backstopped?
What the hell's that mean?

1135
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,850
Carter's gotta say yes for us
to get the tickets.

1136
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:14,846
It's time to go.

1137
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,247
All right.

1138
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,810
- Where's Engell?
- He's in a meeting.

1139
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,884
- Pull him out.
- Uh...

1140
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:35,201
Pull him out!

1141
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,320
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

1142
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,484
Thank you.
See you soon.

1143
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,563
- Sahar's on a bus.
- Great.

1144
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,131
Sahar will be fine.

1145
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,049
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1146
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:48,563
- You two leave right now, right?
- We'll be on a train in half an hour.

1147
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,801
Good.

1148
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,606
<i>N.E. said no.</i>

1149
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:59,448
<i>This is not a long leasher, and it never
has been, and you don't decide if it goes!</i>

1150
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,840
It is going!

1151
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,002
Jack, you are this close.

1152
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,049
Am I? Am I really that close?

1153
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,168
You are this goddamn close to the line
with me.

1154
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:10,881
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1155
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,522
You tell the director to call the White House.
Do your fucking job!

1156
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,201
Get to your plane, Claude.

1157
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,687
First time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first checkpoint.

1158
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,840
<i>The first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.</i>

1159
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:42,040
<i>Passports came straight from Ottawa
last week. They're clean.</i>

1160
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:44,283
Find the White House chief of staff.

1161
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:45,521
How would I find him?

1162
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,690
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1163
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,808
The second checkpoint is immigration.

1164
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,724
You're each gonna hand them one of these.

1165
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,486
<i>It says that you landed in the country
two days ago.</i>

1166
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,044
<i>They'll look for the matching white one,
which doesn't exist.</i>

1167
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,009
<i>You'll say you don't know what happened.</i>

1168
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,083
<i>And if you believe they lost the white slip...</i>

1169
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,441
<i>...they'll believe it too.</i>

1170
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,403
Jordan's in the West Wing.
He's not taking calls.

1171
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,405
Where are his kids?

1172
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,607
What?

1173
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,330
Where do his kids go to school?

1174
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,811
Thank you, thank you.

1175
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,241
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1176
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:32,641
White House.

1177
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:37,402
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace Academy
calling for Mr. Jordan.

1178
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,921
Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.

1179
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,287
Hold for the chief of staff's office.

1180
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:45,046
The third checkpoint is the trap.

1181
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:46,844
It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.

1182
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,721
Most of them were educated
in the U.S. or Europe.

1183
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:53,124
And all of whom are looking for Americans.

1184
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,047
Hello?

1185
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,009
<i>- Jack O'Donnell, from C.I.
- Wait, wait, who?</i>

1186
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,960
Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.
We don't have the president's go-ahead.

1187
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:14,202
<i>They are going to be captured.</i>

1188
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,486
David, pick up!

1189
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,686
Zurich. It's under Harkins.

1190
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,531
I'm sorry, sir, I don't seem
to have these reservations.

1191
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,003
Telex on flash.

1192
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,002
Would you mind checking again, please?

1193
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,411
Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!

1194
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,530
My apologies. It just came through.

1195
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,929
Swissair says they picked up the tickets.

1196
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,731
Get the L.A. office,
tell them to be ready in case they call.

1197
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,048
We told them to shut that down.

1198
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,571
There you go.

1199
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,851
Not here.

1200
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,809
When did you come to Iran?

1201
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,169
Two days ago.

1202
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,004
What was the purpose of your visit?

1203
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,686
We are looking for locations for a film.

1204
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,561
We have a...

1205
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:52,601
Oh, yeah. I've got a letter
from the Ministry of Culture.

1206
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,761
If you want to take a look at that. All right?

1207
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:18,008
- Ahern.
- You can go.

1208
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,210
Come on, come on.

1209
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:46,205
<i>Swissair Flight 363
is now boarding Rows 18 to 35.</i>

1210
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,841
We're going to...

1211
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:55,081
We're together, yes.
The six of us, we're from Canada.

1212
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,682
Purser's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

1213
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,330
They should have boarded already.

1214
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,090
Still no answer in L.A.

1215
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,321
Sir.

1216
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:41,842
Yes, it's a fantasy story
about a war in another world.

1217
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,729
Here you can see our notices.

1218
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,889
Of course I speak Farsi.

1219
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,287
I wish to make a film in Iran.

1220
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:12,487
No, I'm the writer.

1221
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:14,563
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1222
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:19,210
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

1223
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:22,051
Alien villains have taken over the hero's planet.

1224
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:25,409
They fight for their families and
take back the city.

1225
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:31,886
The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.

1226
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,046
So he and his wife storm the castle.

1227
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:40,432
The people... hold that... the
people are inspired to join him.

1228
01:42:40,458 --> 01:42:43,274
They are farmers, but
they learn to fight.

1229
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,809
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

1230
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,243
And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

1231
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,568
You don't go until we verify.

1232
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,122
I understand.

1233
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,482
Sir, you can call our office.

1234
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,005
They'll verify.

1235
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:46,120
- It'd go all the way throughout the '30s.
- We're shooting right now.

1236
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:50,126
- We're just going to the Producers Building.
- Yeah, I understand. We're shooting right now.

1237
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:27,881
<i>Swissair announces
final boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.</i>

1238
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,604
Reset! We're back to one.

1239
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,728
- All right, reset.
- We're going again!

1240
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,884
- We're just right at the Producers...
- Right away, everyone! And rolling!

1241
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:45,367
- We're going to the Producers Building.
- We're rolling.

1242
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:24,650
Sorry, pal. We're gonna be in the movie.
Call my agent.

1243
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,166
Sir!

1244
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,082
Studio Six Productions.

1245
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,401
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

1246
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:47,764
I'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of country
on a location scout. May I take a message?

1247

<i>Doors are closing for Flight 363 to Zurich.</i>

1248

We can go.

1249

You keep these. It's a gift.

1250
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,321
Miss.

1251
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,962
Swissair 363, clearance for taxi?

1252
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:11,602
Swissair 363,
you are number two for departure.

1253
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,806
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, from
the flight deck, we are number two for takeoff.</i>

1254
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,924
Swissair 363, you are cleared for takeoff.

1255
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,889
Swissair 363, cleared for takeoff.

1256
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:15,247
We got wheels up.

1257
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:16,847
Wait.

1258
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:35,091
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce...

1259
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:39,001
...that alcoholic beverages are now available
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

1260
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,490
<i>I love you.</i>

1261
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,807
They're clear. Ha-ha-ha!

1262
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,490
Yes! Yes!

1263
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:34,488
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1264
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:35,841
Yeah, man.

1265
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,009
They're out!

1266
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:41,369
- They're out! They're out!
- We got them out!

1267
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,846
They're out!

1268
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:51,844
Yes!

1269
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,162
Great work, boys.

1270
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:55,361
We did it!

1271
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,523
You are admitted to the Republic of Iraq.

1272
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:56,923
<i>We made history tonight.</i>

1273
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:01,402
History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy.

1274
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:03,564
Quote's the other way around.

1275
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:06,766
- Yeah, who said it?
- Marx.

1276
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:08,727
Groucho said that?

1277
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,760
<i>Call the Times, nail it to the goddamn door.</i>

1278
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,649
CIA are the good guys.

1279
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,643
The Canadians are the good guys.

1280
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:21,529
Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.

1281
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:26,763
Only. Canada takes the credit,
or they retaliate against the hostages.

1282
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,443
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1283
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:32,202
No CIA.

1284
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:33,970
Is that right, Jack?

1285
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,849
Involved in what?

1286
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:41,320
We were as surprised as anybody.

1287
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,009
Thank you, Canada.

1288
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,885
<i>We knew that each day they stayed there...</i>

1289
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,725
<i>...the danger was becoming greater.</i>

1290
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,945
<i>We had been looking for
a solution to have them</i>

1291
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:55,995
<i>leave the country during
the past three months.</i>

1292
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:58,805
<i>Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news.</i>

1293
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:02,760
The U.S. Department of State
hereby honors Joe Stafford...

1294
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,691

01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:15,207
Look at this.

1298
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,290
<i>...Bob Anders.</i>

1299
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:25,011
<i>We Americans will be forever grateful

1300
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:29,404
<i>...for the protection and the safe passage
provided for our diplomats.</i>

1301
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:31,210
<i>Canada will pay...</i>

1302
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:36,565
<i>...for this violation
of the sovereignty of Iran.</i>

1303
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:40,930
<i>Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.</i>

1304
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:50,611
So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,
I'm having breakfast.

1305
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:53,889
Waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:

1306
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:57,408
"You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?"

1307
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,043
And I said to her... Do you know what I said?

1308
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:01,566
No, what?

1309
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:03,565
"Argo fuck yourself. "

1310
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:33,407
All set.

1311
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:35,725
Thanks a lot.

1312
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:47,881
Ha!

1313
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:52,767
Heh. And I left my autograph book at home.

1314
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,084
His Eminence called me.

1315
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:01,486
He wants to see you.

1316
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:03,689
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1317
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:07,167
He wants to give you the Intelligence Star.

1318
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:10,203
You're getting the highest award of merit...

1319
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:13,722
...of the Clandestine Services
of these United States.

1320
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:16,603
Ceremony's on the 14th.

1321
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,963
If they push it a week, I can bring Ian.
That's his winter break.

1322
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:25,809
The op was classified,
so the ceremony's classified.

1323
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:29,009
He can't know about it.
Nobody can know about it.

1324
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,643
So they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.

1325
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,247
That's right.

1326
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:39,487
If we wanted applause,
we would've joined the circus.

1327
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:43,288
- I thought we did.
- Ha.

1328
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:46,770
Carter said you were a great American.

1329
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:49,130
Great American what?

1330
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,170
He didn't say.

1331
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:05,720
What happened to your picture?

1332
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,566
It's in turnaround.

1333
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,450
Can I come in?

1334
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:49,277
The Iran Hostage Crisis ended on
January 20, 1981, when all remaining
hostages were released.
They spent 444 days in captivity.

1335
01:59:50,800 --> 02:00:00,948
The involvement of the C.I.A. complemented efforts of the
Canadian embassy in freeing the six held in Tehran.
To this day, this story stands as an enduring
model for international cooperation between
governments.

1336
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:08,799
All of the Houseguests returned
to the U.S. Foreign Service after
their ordeal in Iran.

1337
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:20,275
Oscar-winning makeup artist
John Chambers was awarded the C.I.A.'s
Intelligence Medal, its highest civilian honor.
He and Mendez remained friends
until Chambers' death in 2001.

1338
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:29,031
Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star was returned
to him in 1997, when the Argo operation was
declassified by President Clinton.

1339
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:47,073
He lives in rural Maryland with his family.

1340
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:44,526
<i>Carter: They went in, as you know, under
the guise of creating a motion-picture film.</i>

1341
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:49,362
<i>But that it had a very high possibility
of failure.</i>

1342
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,807
<i>And after it was successful, of course...</i>

1343
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,765
<i>...it was a great temptation
to reveal all the stories...</i>

1344
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:58,362
<i>... so maybe I could take a little bit
of credit for it, since I was president...</i>

1345
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:03,128
<i>... but we had to keep it secret.
Tony Mendez has gone down in CIA history...</i>

1346
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:05,169
<i>... after his retirement...</i>

1347
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:12,169
<i>... as one of the 50 most important
CIA operatives of all time.</i>

1348
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:18,170
<i>Eventually we got every hostage
back home, safe and sound...</i>

1349
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:22,365
<i>... and we upheld the integrity of our country,
and we did it peacefully.</i>
