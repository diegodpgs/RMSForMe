<i>The rumors of my promiscuity
have been greatly exaggerated.</i>

5
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:10,277
<i>I used to be anonymous,
invisible to the opposite sex.</i>

6
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,237
<i>If Google Earth were a guy...</i>

7
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,449
<i>...he couldn't find me if I was
dressed up as a 10-story building.</i>

8
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,328
<i>Pretty cutting-edge stuff, huh?
A high school girl feeling anonymous.</i>

9
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,956
<i>Who am I? What does it all mean?
Why am I here? Blah.</i>

10
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,376
<i>But don't worry,
this isn't one of those tales.</i>

11
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,504
<i>Though it sure started out
that way.</i>

12
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,381
<i>And then it changed pretty quickly
when I started lying...</i>

13
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,176
<i>...about some
very personal things.</i>

14
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,138
<i>So let the record show that I,
Olive Penderghast...</i>

15
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:43,060
<i>...being of sound mind,
and below-average breast size...</i>

16
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,395
<i>...swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...</i>

17
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,649
<i>...and nothing but the truth.
Starting now.</i>

18
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,902
<i>And what better way
to share my private thoughts...</i>

19
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,987
<i>...than to broadcast them
on the Internet?</i>

20
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,491
So here it is. Part one.

21
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,663
The shudder-inducing and cliched,
however totally false account...

22
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:07,042
...of how I lost my virginity
to a guy at a community college.

23
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:12,047
Let me just begin by saying that
there are two sides to every story.

24
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,134
And this is my side,
the right one.

25
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,052
George is not a sexy name.

26
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,138
George is what you name
your teddy bear...

27
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,640
...not the name you wanna
scream out during climax.

28
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,560
And by that,
I assume you mean?

29
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,271
The stable and self-perpetuating
end stage...

30
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,314
...in the evolution
of a plant community.

31
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,150
- Right.
- Why, what were you thinking?

32
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,237
The same. But I don't say it out loud
lest someone get the wrong idea.

33
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,323
I think you know innuendo
is attached to everything these days.

34
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,534
Innuendo? What...?
Whatever do you mean?

35
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,204
Rhiannon, Olive, go hit the books.
They don't hit back.

36
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:48,917
Also, hugs not drugs.
Mess with the bull, get the horns.

37
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,670
And any other cliches
you can come up with.

38
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,298
Bye, Mr. Griffith.

39
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,757
Bye.

40
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,385
- Watch your mouth.
- Sorry.

41
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,888
<i>Mr. Griffith
is my favorite teacher.</i>

42
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,015
<i>Although,
after all the trouble I caused...</i>

43
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,434
<i>...I don't know if I'm still
his favorite student.</i>

44
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,060
You know,
these are bad for you.

45
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,731
It leads to unwanted pregnancy,
all sorts of things.

46
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,735
Mismatched tires on your vehicle,
which is nonexistent.

47
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:19,198
<i>And here is where the trouble began.
The lie that started the whole thing.</i>

48
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,243
Please, please, I'm begging you.
I will pay you. I'll pay you.

49
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,245
Rhi, I cannot go camping
with you, okay?

50
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,122
I'm sorry,
but I have a date.

51
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,917
- Okay? I told you.
- With who?

52
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,840
You don't know him.

53
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,421
And neither do you,
you selfish bitch.

54
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,923
Yes, I do. He goes to college
with my brother.

55
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,674
Okay. What's his name, then?

56
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,677
<i>Rhiannon is what you'd call
a strong personality.</i>

57
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,138
<i>She asked me to come camping
with her family...</i>

58
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,224
<i>...and I don't know why
I didn't wanna go.</i>

59
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,602
<i>A little because I didn't feel like
hanging out with her all weekend.</i>

60
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,105
<i>But mostly because her parents are
the weirdest people I have ever met...</i>

61
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,566
<i>...and I live in California.</i>

62
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,277
<i>I ate dinner at her house once
and I swore, never again.</i>

63
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,738
- This is interesting.
- Patchouli burger.

64
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,990
We grew it
in our victory garden.

65
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,617
You want some dessert?

66
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,245
No, thank you.
I'm trying to watch my figure.

67
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,205
Well, I'm not.

68
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,166
<i>So I lied and told her
I couldn't go...</i>

69
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,419
<i>...because I had a date with a friend
of my brother's named George.</i>

70
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,673
Let's just face it, there is
no such thing as a sexy George.

71
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,258
Yeah, well, mine is...

72
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,928
...so I think we should just
put this conversation to bed.

73
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,848
Fine, don't go camping with us.
Just know I hate you, bitch.

74
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,351
Go get your chocolate milk.

75
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,646
- Do you want one?
- No.

76
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,440
<i>And here's how I really spent
the weekend.</i>

77
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,451
That's the worst song ever.

78
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,376
<i>But on Monday, when Rhi asked me
how my weekend was...</i>

79
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,212
He was charming, you know?
He was a real gentleman.

80
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,632
And it feels like I got a love
and I know that it's all mine.

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,552
Okay, okay. Wait, wait.
So are you going to see him again?

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,014
No. No, probably not. You know,
it was just one of those weekends.

83
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,766
A whole weekend?

84
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,434
Yup.

85
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,562
- Wait a minute.
You didn't have...? - What?

86
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,731
No. No, of course not.

87
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,068
You liar. You totally lost
your V-card to him.

88
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,861
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

89
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,572
- Tell me everything.
- Rhi, I'm not that kind of girl.

90
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,075
The kind that does it,
or the kind that does it...

91
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,577
...and doesn't have the balls
to tell her friend?

92
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,412
- What?
- I want every detail.

93
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,914
- Rhi.
- Now, bitch.

94
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,999
You know, you call me "bitch"
a lot. Okay?

95
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,294
- It's not a term of endearment.
- I want every detail. Now, shitface.

96
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,421
You're not heading
in the right direction.

97
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,006
Tell me.

98
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,758
Fine.

99
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,302
We did it.

100
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,595
Yes!

101
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,056
Finally. Now you're
a super slut like me.

102
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,683
I don't think letting
Peter Hedlund motorboat you...

103
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,937
...behind a Bed Bath & Beyond
really makes you a super slut.

104
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,399
There were a lot of people walking
past. Someone could've easily seen.

105
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,277
Whatever. This isn't about me,
this is about you.

106
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,487
What'd you let him do?

107
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:50,575
It was normal. You know?
Nothing freaky.

108
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,994
<i>I don't know
why I did it.</i>

109
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,622
<i>I guess maybe it was because
it was the first time...</i>

110
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,250
<i>...I had sort of felt superior
to Rhi.</i>

111
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,810
<i>But I just started
piling on lie after lie.</i>

112
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:01,896
<i>It was like setting up Jenga.</i>

113
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,463
Do you know, like, Glade candles?

114
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,967
Those kind, but they were, like,
sexy Glade candles.

115
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,845
- He was sweet. He was...
- Of course.

116
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,227
What the hell are you looking at,
Sister Christian?

117
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,771
Just a couple of admitted whores.

118
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,860
<i>Marianne Bryant is the secretary
of the student council...</i>

119
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,446
<i>...chairman of the Orange Blossom
dance committee...</i>

120
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,823
<i>...and president of
the Cross Your Heart Club...</i>

121
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,034
<i>...a club dedicated to shoving
their beliefs down people's throats.</i>

122
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,661
Obviously they don't care.

123
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,789
<i>Last year's cause celebre was
the changing of the school mascot.</i>

124
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,043
Give it up for your Blue Devils!

125
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,212
Blue!

126
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,756
Blue Devil!

127
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,677
Yeah.

128
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,680
Yeah!

129
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,767
How can we exhibit school pride
when we're conveyed to others...

130
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,561
...as Satan worshippers?

131
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,190
<i>Now, thankfully,
we're the much less intimidating...</i>

132
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,526
Give it up for the Woodchucks!

133
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,987
Hey! Go, Woodchucks!

134
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,448
Woodchucks!

135
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,081
I liked Todd much better
when he was topless.

136
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,418
Yeah, but even dressed as a woodchuck,
I still fantasize about him.

137
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,212
Woodchucks.

138
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,050
<i>Now Marianne had
a new cause celebre.</i>

139
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,718
<i>Me.</i>

140
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,346
Which brings us to part two.

141
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,266
The accelerated velocity
of terminological inexactitude.

142
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:43,104
<i>Which is really just my obnoxious way
of saying that lies travel fast.</i>

143
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:47,901
<i>And, boy, did my terminological
inexactitude accelerate with velocity.</i>

144
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,945
Did you hear about Olive?

145
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,634
No way.

146
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,103
- She's not a virgin anymore?
- I can't believe it.

147
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,105
- Olive lost her virginity.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,442
Maybe next time a certain somebody
will be a little more careful...

149
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,319
...what she says
in the water closet.

150
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,614
Yeah, about that? It's...
That's actually not what you think.

151
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,950
Can I talk to you alone
for a second?

152
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,245
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

153
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,165
Bye, Nina.

154
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:49,170
What you heard in the bathroom
the other day wasn't true at all.

155
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,799
- It's actually a funny story.
- Olive. That's your name, right?

156
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,303
Yeah, yeah. And you're Marianne.

157
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,847
We've had nine classes together
since kindergarten.

158
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,017
Ten, if you count Religion
of Other Cultures, which you didn't...

159
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,144
...because you refused to go.

160
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,980
Yeah. Listen, I'm not the one
that you have to answer to...

161
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,565
...for your depraved behavior.

162
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,610
There's a higher power
that will judge you for your indecency.

163
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,653
Tom Cruise?

164
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,239
I hope for your sake
that God has a sense of humor.

165
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,035
Oh, I have 17 years' worth
of anecdotal proof he does.

166
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,120
You've made your bed.

167
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,956
I just hope for your sake
that you've cleaned the sheets.

168
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,668
- Did I just get saved?
- I missed you.

169
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,003
Oh, you too.

170
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,547
<i>So Marianne spread the rumor.</i>

171
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:36,051
<i>For the first time ever, my sexual
exploits were the talk of the school.</i>

172
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,678
<i>Oh, you know what? I'm wrong.
It was the second time.</i>

173
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,847
<i>The first time was back
in 8th grade...</i>

174
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,684
<i>...when all I wanted was a kiss from
this guy I had always had a crush on.</i>

175
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,104
<i>Todd and I were thrown together
in Seven Minutes of Heaven.</i>

176
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:52,942
<i>Luckily we had a super romantic
song from our youth to set the mood.</i>

177
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,029
I think this is the part...

178
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,865
...where you're supposed to
stick your tongue in my mouth.

179
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,575
That's what I've heard, anyway.

180
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,952
Just give me a second, okay?

181
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,872
According to my watch,
you have 382 of them.

182
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,290
- How do you do that?
- What?

183
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,751
Add so fast.
And you also talk like a grown-up.

184
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,213
Don't worry, I'm not nearly as smart
as I think I am.

185
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:19,219
So if we didn't do anything,
could you still tell people we kissed?

186
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,515
Absolutely.

187
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,850
- Thanks, Olive.
- Sure, Todd.

188
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
<i>I actually didn't wanna lie
that time.</i>

189
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,690
<i>When people thought
I'd kissed someone, they didn't care.</i>

190
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,942
<i>But when they thought
I slept with someone...</i>

191
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,569
Hey, Olive. How's it going?

192
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,406
I'm swell,
Guy-I've-Never-Talked-to-Before.

193
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,491
Thanks for asking.

194
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:46,913
<i>All I could think to myself was,
"Great, now I'm a tramp".</i>

195
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,082
<i>I'm gonna have to get
a lower-back tattoo...</i>

196
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,543
<i>...and pierce something
not on my face.</i>

197
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,212
You guys know that
I was here all weekend, right?

198
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,797
- Yeah.
- Yes, you were upstairs.

199
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,507
- Yeah.
- You would testify to that?

200
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,634
- Yeah.
- I would take a bullet for you.

201
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,553
You know that.
Right between the eyes.

202
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,013
Man, I would slit my throat...

203
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,099
...rather than say something
to someone...

204
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,935
- ...that you didn't want me to say.
- That's not necessary.

205
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,896
- But that is comforting.
- That's how I am, how I roll.

206
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,815
That's how I do, as they say.

207
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,527
- I like the pants.
- Thank you. They're Costco.

208
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,571
You can have them
when you get taller.

209
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,240
- I'm never gonna go through puberty.
- Course you will.

210
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,284
But we're a family of late bloomers.

211
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,203
I didn't until I was 14.
Nor did Olive.

212
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,289
Why does that matter?
I'm adopted.

213
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,168
What? Oh, my God.
Who told you?

214
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,713
Guys, we were gonna do this
at the right time.

215
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,922
Listen to me.

216
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,217
Sometimes, even when a man and
a woman love each other very much...

217
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,052
...like your mother and I used to...

218
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,930
...their insides just don't cooperate
with each other.

219
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,348
So, what's going on, honey?

220
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,643
Why do you want us to take a bullet
if anyone asks if you were here?

221
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,146
It's nothing. It's just the rumor mill.

222
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,483
What's the rumor mill churning out
these days? Anything interesting?

223
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,694
You know, not really. Not really.
It's a little low on grist.

224
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,655
Clever wordplay. I like it.
You must be related to me.

225
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,991
- Only by marriage.
- Give it to me.

226
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,494
So, what we're all gonna take away
from this:

227
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,371
- I was here all weekend, right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

228
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,833
<i>Remember how I told you
Google Earth couldn't find me...</i>

229
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,127
<i>...if I was dressed up
as a ten-story building?</i>

230
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,940
<i>Well, the next day
it could find me</i>

231
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:20,090
<i>if I was dressed
as a crack on a sidewalk.</i>

232
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,509
<i>That's the beauty of being
a girl in high school.</i>

233
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,179
<i>People hear you had sex once
and, bam, you're a bimbo.</i>

234
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,890
<i>I really didn't mean for the lie
to put me on the map...</i>

235
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,227
<i>...but I gotta admit,
I kind of liked being on the map.</i>

236
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,648
So, clearly Nathaniel Hawthorne
is a complex writer.

237
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,441
Even I had trouble with him.

238
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,694
I read him originally when I was 5,
but I struggled.

239
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,823
So I'm gonna break it down for you.
I'm gonna throw some rhymes.

240
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,991
Anson, drop me a beat.

241
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,868
- What?
- Give me a beat.

242
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,912
Push it up.

243
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,666
<i>Yeah, adultery, vengeance</i>

244
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,168
<i>Crimes of passion</i>

245
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,379
Kill the beat.
I'm not gonna rap for you.

246
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,589
It's pandering
and it's been done before...

247
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,884
...in every bad movie
you've ever seen. Okay.

248
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,679
<i>Ironically, we were studying
The Scarlet Letter.</i>

249
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,722
<i>Now, isn't that always the way?</i>

250
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,059
<i>The books you read in class always
have some strong connection...</i>

251
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,062
<i>...with whatever angsty
adolescent drama is going on.</i>

252
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,190
<i>Except for Huckleberry Finn.
I don't know any teenage boys...</i>

253
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,943
<i>...who have ever run away
with a big, hulking black guy.</i>

254
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,571
<i>For those who haven't read
The Scarlet Letter...</i>

255
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,755
...or for those who said
you did but really didn't,

256
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,409
here's all you need to know.

257
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,411
<i>This girl, Hester Prynne,
has an affair with a minister...</i>

258
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,415
<i>...is besmirched and made to wear
a red A for "adulterer".</i>

259
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,876
<i>The town realizes
she was too harshly judged...</i>

260
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,920
<i>...and she's really a good person,
and she dies a saint.</i>

261
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,922
<i>A whole bunch
of other stuff happens too.</i>

262
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,950
If you have a test on it,
rent the movie,

263
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,635
but make sure
it's the original...

264
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,430
...not the Demi Moore version where
she talks in a fake British accent...

265
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,348
...and takes a lot of baths.

266
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:57,437
To say that one was freely adapted
is a bit of an understatement, guvnor.

267
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,606
What we have to realize...

268
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,067
...is that Hester lived
in an entirely different time.

269
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,270
A time when the worst crime
a woman could commit...

270
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,450
...was in fact adultery.

271
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,284
Nina.

272
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,411
I think Hester Prynne was...

273
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,122
Excuse my language... A skank.

274
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,750
A skank? So you don't think
she was a victim at all?

275
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,127
Why should I?
She brought it on herself.

276
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,966
Perhaps you should embroider a red A
on your wardrobe, abominable tramp.

277
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,970
Perhaps you should get a wardrobe,
you abominable twat.

278
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,141
<i>Not my best line,
but it was provocative enough...</i>

279
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,810
<i>...to land me
in the principal's office.</i>

280
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,654
Seems as if someone's
on a downward spiral.

281
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,366
Seems as if someone's
practicing the mundane activities...

282
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,701
...she'll be saddled with
the rest of her life.

283
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,663
I hope you at least had the good sense
to use protection.

284
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,289
Why? Your parents didn't.

285
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,167
- You're going to hell.
- Just as long as you won't be there.

286
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,169
I can assure you I won't.

287
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,672
Good.

288
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,055
I don't care who started it.
Just work it out.

289
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,686
Penderghast.

290
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,898
So why am I just meeting you?

291
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,651
Language like this would've
warranted a visit years ago.

292
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,863
This is the first time I've done
anything remotely misbehavioral.

293
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,156
This is foul.

294
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,575
I know. I am so...
I'm really, really sorry.

295
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,036
Sorry you said it
or sorry you got caught?

296
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,163
Sorry I said it, honestly.

297
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,720
And sorry I got caught
a little bit too,

298
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:42,960
but mostly just sorry
I said it.

299
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,046
If you use a word like this again in my
school, it'll be your last. Understand?

300
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,256
Yes, sir. Yes.

301
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,883
I mean, this isn't one of
those progressive schools...

302
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,553
...where teachers are called
by their first names...

303
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,347
...and students
are partners in learning...

304
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,475
...and there's a fundraising auction
at the end of the year...

305
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,895
...where the more creative parents
put on musical skits...

306
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,064
...about the community garden.

307
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,942
This is public school.

308
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,250
If I can keep the girls off the pole
and the boys off the pipe,

309
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,531
I get a bonus.

310
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,241
Now, if you're sent to me
one more time...

311
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,786
...you're gonna be out on your fantail.
Now, am I making myself clear?

312
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,079
Yes, sir.

313
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,040
- Good.
- I think so.

314
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,175
I mean, I got a little lost
in the middle,

315
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,128
but I found my way back.

316
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,087
Detention after school
tomorrow.

317
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,257
Now, out.

318
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,971
<i>Even though it was my slutty alter ego
that said a bad word in school...</i>

319
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,390
<i>...it was my ass that got in trouble...</i>

320
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,560
<i>...which was a place my ass
had never been before.</i>

321
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,192
Hey, Olive.

322
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,153
Oh, my God. The illusion is shattered.

323
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,782
They put you in the gas chamber if you
take your head off at Disney World.

324
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,618
I think they just fire you.
You're thinking of Disneyland.

325
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,620
- Disney World is more liberal.
- Oh, yeah.

326
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,664
I always forget Disney World
went blue in the last election.

327
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,708
Are you going
to Melody Bostic's party?

328
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,460
I hadn't planned on it.

329
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,671
Me neither. My cousin's getting
married. It's a rehearsal dinner.

330
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,466
See you. Stay excellent.

331
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,967
You too.

332
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,427
- What's up, kid?
- Woodchuck.

333
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,931
Please tell me the rumors are true.

334
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,558
Yes. Yes. I am a big, fat slut.

335
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,187
No, the one where you got suspended
for calling Nina Howell a dick...

336
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,439
...and punching her in the left tit.

337
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,110
I worry about the way information
circulates at this school.

338
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,446
Rhi? I need to tell you something.

339
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,491
Like the exact moment
you turned into such a badass?

340
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,493
- I think I'm in love with you.
- Okay.

341
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,329
Tell me you left a mark
on that scrunched-up face of hers?

342
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,331
- It's not true.
- It wasn't the left tit?

343
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,334
It was the right one.
I always pegged you for a southpaw.

344
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,087
Can you listen to me
for one second, please?

345
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,465
Okay. It didn't happen.

346
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,511
Oh, yeah, right. Your secret's safe
with me, you little sex monkey.

347
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,143
I got sent to the principal today.

348
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,395
Did you win a medal or something?

349
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,604
Not exactly.

350
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:13,359
I used inappropriate language
in English class.

351
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,529
Although we're reading a book
that I personally deem...

352
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,710
...wildly inappropriate
for our age group,

353
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:20,534
so I actually felt
it was quite apropos.

354
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,951
What did you say?

355
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,205
Let's just say
it was an inappropriate word.

356
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,707
Well, what did it start with?

357
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,251
A snide comment
from a snotty girl in my class.

358
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,796
No, I mean what letter
did the word start with?

359
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,590
<i>- T.
- Oh, T.</i>

360
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:40,219
- T? Let us think. T, T, T.
- T. All right, T. Yeah, T.

361
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:44,724
- T, T, T.
- T, T, T.

362
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,737
- Guys.
- Noun, adjective or verb?

363
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,032
Noun. It's definitely slang.
Think British.

364
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,075
Tallywhacker? Termagant?

365
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,831
You're just saying sounds.
Those are sounds.

366
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,918
- Spell it with your peas.
- Yeah, spell it with your peas. Do it.

367
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,753
- I will take that challenge.
- Do it.

368
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,254
I like that. All right.

369
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,715
So does this have anything to do
with the rumor...

370
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,926
...that you mentioned
the other night?

371
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,387
Do you need to talk to us
about something, sweetie?

372
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,514
What's a twit?

373
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,433
That's an A, honey.

374
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,852
It'll get you sent
to the principal's office.

375
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,187
Sit down.

376
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,898
We're lucky that this
is not a common occurrence.

377
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,108
What would my punishment
have been otherwise?

378
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,862
- Bed without supper, I guess.
- But I'm already finished.

379
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,282
- No dating. No dating.
- Yeah, no dating.

380
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,451
- No dating for you, young lady.
- No dating.

381
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,870
I think my complete lack of allure...

382
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,623
...already kind of
shot that horse in the face.

383
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,960
I wouldn't know how to be grounded
more than you know how to ground.

384
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,462
That's right. Love you. Come here.

385
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,341
And I bet that girl was acting
like exactly what you called her.

386
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,634
Oh, you have no idea.

387
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,305
I got a B-plus
on my spelling test today.

388
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,059
That's good, honey, but everything
has spell check these days, so...

389
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,394
Just kidding.

390
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,564
Where are you from originally?

391
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,692
<i>So the next day
I had detention...</i>

392
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,153
<i>...which, thanks to recent
budget cuts, meant cleaning.</i>

393
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,739
<i>I was looking forward to
getting all this behind me.</i>

394
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,492
<i>I had done the crime.
I was gonna do the time.</i>

395
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,869
<i>And that would be that,
but that...</i>

396
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,831
Aren't there, like,
child labor laws against this?

397
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,124
Not in high school.

398
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,461
The principal's like the captain
of the ship in international waters.

399
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,255
He can even marry people.

400
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,925
We haven't talked in a while.
How have you been, Brandon?

401
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,762
Fabulous. I'm crushing it.
Everything according to plan.

402
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,931
I wanna be in detention.

403
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,349
Yeah, why are you here?

404
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,978
From the blood I saw gushing out of
your nose, I thought you were bullied.

405
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,523
Principal Gibbons is a homophobe,
which is why I called him a fascist.

406
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,245
So the rumors are true.

407
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,028
I don't know
what you're talking about.

408
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,821
I meant about
Gibbons being a fascist.

409
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,367
So, what's with your new look?
Very whore couture.

410
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,871
Oh, haven't you heard?
I'm the new school slut.

411
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,624
You know, I did hear something.
I also heard he was twice your age.

412
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,377
Oh, no, no, no.
No, he was a freshman in college.

413
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,671
I also heard he gave you crabs.

414
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,549
- People suck.
- Tell me about it.

415
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,136
He's not real.

416
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,891
- What? - The guy I slept with.
I made him up.

417
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,060
Wait, you started the rumor?

418
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,270
Indirectly, I guess sort of.

419
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:40,733
Or actually, no.
No, not really. No, I didn't.

420
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,861
Well, but you're perpetuating it.
That's really messed up.

421
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,154
Excuse me?

422
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,407
You're not even a real slut.
You just want people to think you are.

423
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,076
It's pathetic.

424
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:55,081
No offense, but you could probably
learn something from me, Brando.

425
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:59,960
Are you saying that I should
act straight so people will like me?

426
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,923
That's groundbreaking. You should
teach a course at The Learning Annex.

427
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,176
It could be called "The Painfully
Obvious with Olive Penderghast...

428
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,636
...the Fake School Slut".

429
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,931
I was just suggesting that
maybe these kids we call peers...

430
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,767
...are onto something.
You know, like Marianne Bryant.

431
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:19,897
Maybe that whole stuck-up,
Jesus-freak thing is an act. You know?

432
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,441
No, I think she's just
a stuck-up Jesus freak.

433
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,861
And there are some of us who are
just trying to blend in to the crowd.

434
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,031
Well, then you've gotta do
everything you can to blend in...

435
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,950
...or decide not to care.

436
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,870
I can't decide if you're a genius
or a lunatic.

437
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,041
Well, don't they sort of go
hand in hand?

438
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,921
- So you heard any word
from George? - Nope.

439
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,801
I told you, that was a one-night stand,
which is now over.

440
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,053
You're being pretty cavalier
about this.

441
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,639
Aren't you supposed to be
eternally in love with him?

442
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,890
Yes, I believe so.
If I was a Gossip Girl

443
00:23:55,895 --> 00:23:57,477
in Sweet Valley
with traveling pants.

444
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:01,981
But no, I'm not.
So I could really care less.

445
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,316
So Brandy Carter
was telling Vanessa Hodges...

446
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,319
...that you were with three guys
in a Jacuzzi.

447
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,405
Sounds like a lot of work.

448
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,117
I guess that's still better than
getting it on with some old dude.

449
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,618
Who said that?

450
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,747
Do you know that Brandon kid?
That's what somebody told him.

451
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,999
Isn't he a homo?

452
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,001
Yeah.

453
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,967
Speak of the devil. Hello.

454
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,845
I was just talking about you
with my friend, Rhiannon.

455
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,432
You know Rhiannon.
She's perpetually angry.

456
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,684
She curses like a Somali sailor.
Bi...

457
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,312
- Yeah. That's the one.
- "Bi-"? "Bi-"? What's "bi-"?

458
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,148
- Okay.
- I wanna know what "bi-" is.

459
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,025
Hello, what's "bi-"? What is "bi-"?

460
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,277
- Bye.
- "Bi-"? What is "bi-"?

461
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,447
Bedazzling personality?
Beautiful, beautiful soul?

462
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,200
- Big tits.
- That's my identifier?

463
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,619
Yes!

464
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,539
All right, well, that was Brandon. He
needs to talk to me about something.

465
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,584
- Probably wants to borrow an outfit.
- Whatever, Big Tits.

466
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,294
Heck, yeah!

467
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,880
Big tits!

468
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,841
The next day, things took a turn
for the scandalous...

469
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,968
...which brings us to part three.

470
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,889
A lady's choice
and a gentleman's agreement.

471
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,905
Hi. Is there an Olive here?

472
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,241
There's a whole jar of them
in the fridge.

473
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,576
I'm sorry,
I must have the wrong address.

474
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,078
Just kidding. Come on in.

475
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,165
Any friend of Olive's
is a friend of our daughter's.

476
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,334
Olive, sweetie.

477
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,586
There's a young man
here to see you.

478
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,423
He said something about asking
for your hand in marriage.

479
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,884
Oh, happy day, Mama!

480
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,387
Oh, I thought I was gonna have
to spend my dowry...

481
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,390
...on booze and pills
to numb the loneliness.

482
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,892
A gentleman caller, hurray!

483
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,395
- What's that?
- Olive has a boy in her room.

484
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,729
- A boy?
- A boy.

485
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,107
- Wow, a boy.
- A boy.

486
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,942
A boy?

487
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,944
A boy.

488
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,448
Welcome.
This is where the magic happens.

489
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,284
And by magic I mean nothing.

490
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,077
- Do you wanna go out with me?
- What?

491
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,913
Well, I mean, like,
do you wanna be my girlfriend?

492
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,544
Brandon, just a couple hours ago
you told me you were Kinsey Six gay.

493
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,463
True, but you said I should
pretend to be straight, so...

494
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,465
Yeah, I didn't mean with me.

495
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:38,596
I mean, you're a nice guy and all,
but you're not really my type.

496
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,556
Yeah, you're not really
my type either.

497
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,642
Yeah, I know that. I got that V
where you'd rather see a P.

498
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,477
Do you wanna
have sex with me or not?

499
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,605
Oh, my God, dude.

500
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,231
You completely missed the point.

501
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,151
- That's not what I was saying.
- I know what you were saying.

502
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,820
I should act straight
till I get out of this hellhole.

503
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,156
Then I can be whoever I wanna be.
I get that.

504
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,159
You know that I didn't have sex
with a college guy, right?

505
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,077
I just told everybody I did.

506
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,831
Actually, I told one person I did.
And you know how these things work.

507
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,166
It's like wildfire.

508
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,919
So you're saying
I shouldn't really have sex?

509
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:14,798
I should just say I had sex
with someone. A girl.

510
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,343
Yes. Yes.

511
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,352
Oh, no.

512
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,730
- Wai... Just...
- Oh, no, no, no.

513
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,180
- No way! No way!
- Just wait. Wait, wait.

514
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:33,026
- No! No, no...
- Stop it, stop it.

515
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,527
- Absolutely not.
- Think about it. Think about it.

516
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,946
- We could help each other out.
- No.

517
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,699
You wanna maintain
this floozy facade.

518
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,036
I don't wanna get pushed into shit
every day. It's a win-win-win.

519
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,372
How do you know I like
being thought of as a floozy?

520
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,624
Because at least
you're being thought of.

521
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,835
Just one good imaginary bonk.

522
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,546
You are on crack. All right?
And not the good kind.

523
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,048
It doesn't have to be a bonk.

524
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,717
It could be an imaginary butterbean,
lemon squeeze...

525
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,096
- I don't know what any of that means.
- That's because you're a virgin.

526
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,390
You know what?
This is not the answer at all.

527
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,643
- I'll pay you whatever you want.
- I don't want your money, Brandon.

528
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,812
Just do what I did
and make someone up.

529
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,855
Who's going to believe me?

530
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,820
You don't understand how hard it is,
all right? I'm tormented.

531
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:22,199
And every day at school
is like I'm being suffocated.

532
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,743
And sure, we can sit
and fantasize all we want...

533
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,371
...about how things
are gonna be different one day...

534
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,415
...but this is today and it sucks.

535
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,793
There's only one way around it.
You were smart enough to think of it.

536
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,546
So please, just help me.

537
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,383
Because I can't take another day
of this. I don't know what I'll do.

538
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,768
I don't do anything half-assed.
All right?

539
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,437
It'll have to be a public event.

540
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,022
Melody Bostic is throwing
a party tomorrow night.

541
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,570
All of your tormentors
will be there.

542
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:58,111
You and I are going together.
All right?

543
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,448
You have to do everything I say and
tell everyone that I am sensational.

544
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,743
- Thank you so much
for doing this. - Just...

545
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,580
...you know, make sure you're ready
to live with the consequences.

546
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,710
- What the hell is a lemon squeeze?
- It's like a backwards melon bag.

547
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,921
How don't I know any of this?

548
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,468
<i>The next night was the party
at Melody Bostic's house.</i>

549
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,970
<i>She is the most popular girl
in school.</i>

550
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,681
<i>It's partly because she's pretty
and has perfect hair...</i>

551
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,768
<i>...but mostly because her parents
let her have these parties...</i>

552
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,395
<i>...every time she catches them
doing it in the pool...</i>

553
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,690
<i>...which is every week,
apparently.</i>

554
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,818
<i>Brandon and I showed up
when it was in full swing.</i>

555
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,113
<i>I borrowed a dress from my mom,
Brandon borrowed a jacket from me...</i>

556
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,199
<i>...and we put on a little show.</i>

557
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,035
Hey, Olive and Brandon.

558
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,495
What's up?

559
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:53,040
I hope you don't mind, but we had
a few pre-cocktail-party cocktails...

560
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,293
...like, before the cocktail party
with cocktails.

561
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,131
Listen, here's the sitch,
Melody Bostic.

562
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,455
Brandon was just in the middle
of telling me

563
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,929
this really funny thing...

564
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,262
...which is really funny.

565
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,225
And I was wondering if there's,
like, a room where we could go...

566
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,686
...where he could finish telling me
that thing that's funny...

567
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,146
...if you know what I mean.

568
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,606
You can use my room.

569
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,526
Down the hall to the left.

570
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,029
Cool.

571
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,282
Is that Olive with Brandon?

572
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,368
I know. What the hell, right?

573
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,245
You guys are my buddies.

574
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,038
I'm drunk, bitches. What's up?

575
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,706
I love your room!

576
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,209
My sheets. Put a towel down.

577
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:41,088
- Olive's gonna do a gay dude.
- Thanks. Close the shades.

578
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,302
- What are you doing?
- Relax.

579
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,139
Jesus, what is with you gays? Are you
really that repulsed by lady parts?

580
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,559
What do you think I have
down there, a gnome?

581
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,652
So nice. What is that, lavender?
It's pretty.

582
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,530
What are you doing? Can you...?
Can you come here, please?

583
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,866
Jacket off. Come on.

584
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,661
All right. Come on.
Chop-chop. All right.

585
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,205
Now grunt.
Grunt and make it convincing.

586
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,918
I said grunt, not whine.
Just grunt.

587
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,592
Moan, you know?
Like, sex noises.

588
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,761
God, you are pathetic.

589
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,438
Good. Good.

590
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,151
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

591
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,111
Oh, yeah.

592
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,572
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

593
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,245
- You don't have to be so aggressive.
- You don't like that?

594
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,456
- No, I don't like that.
- You don't like that?

595
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,916
How about that?

596
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,918
- Little better.
- Yeah, you like that.

597
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,794
I like that.

598
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,923
- This guy, he's gay, no?
- I think he's gay.

599
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,592
- Don't stop!
- Keep going.

600
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,969
- Don't stop.
- I'm not gonna stop.

601
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,429
I'm not gonna stop.

602
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,972
Now you try. You try.

603
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,310
I'm gonna turn you around
and take you from the back.

604
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,979
That's not gonna make people
think you're straight.

605
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:25,317
Never mind that gayness
because I'm a straight guy. Roar!

606
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,323
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

607
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,659
- That's awesome!
That's perfect! - Yeah!

608
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,452
That's what I'm talking about!

609
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,956
Do you smell that?
Do you smell us?

610
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,833
Did he just say it smelled?

611
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,003
Isn't it supposed to smell?

612
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,964
You're not supposed
to comment on it.

613
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:51,593
- It doesn't really smell that bad.
- Oh, yeah. Yes, God!

614
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,805
- Don't stop. Yeah!
- Don't stop. It's too much fun.

615
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,099
- You ready for the grand finale?
- Yeah. What?

616
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,562
Oh, yeah.

617
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,939
Yeah.

618
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,987
Come on.

619
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,822
Oh, my God.

620
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,661
Go forth, my son.
You're a man now.

621
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,330
Hey.

622
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,000
Thank you.

623
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,131
Seriously, thanks.

624
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,849
- Here.
- What is this?

625
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,267
Evidence.

626
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,650
What's up?

627
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,198
Hey, man.

628
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,742
How was she?

629
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:01,997
Well, well, let's just say
I'll be walking funny tomorrow.

630
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,999
What?

631
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,252
- I'm drunk. What's up, bitches?
- Yeah!

632
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,767
- Whoa, hey.
- Todd, hi.

633
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,394
I thought you were at
your cousin's rehearsal dinner.

634
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,272
It was a quick rehearsal.
I only had one line.

635
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,940
That was a joke.

636
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,568
I know.

637
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,862
Yeah, sorry. How's it going?

638
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,782
You know, I'm...

639
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,117
- I'm here.
- Can I get you a beer?

640
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,620
That rhymed. I liked it.

641
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,538
Yeah.

642
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,966
- I'm gonna go.
- You sure?

643
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:59,137
- Yeah. Bye.
- See you at the salt mines.

644
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,139
<i>Maybe this is gonna sound
stupid...</i>

645
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,726
...and, believe me, it's not like
I was expecting, you know, fireworks...

646
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,437
...or a string quartet or anything...

647
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,024
...but I always thought pretending
to lose my virginity...

648
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,943
...would be a little more...

649
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,237
...I don't know, special?

650
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,032
Judy Blume should've
prepared me for that.

651
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,125
That is so beautiful.

652
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,751
Never had one lesson.

653
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,379
That boy from yesterday
just dropped this off for you.

654
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,800
Well, put it in the pile of gifts
from my other suitors.

655
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,761
- Thanks.
- He seems like a nice kid.

656
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,972
He seemed a little incredibly gay.

657
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,599
A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual,
that boy is.

658
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,019
I just want you to know your father
and I are totally supportive.

659
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,564
We love you no matter
what the sexual orientation...

660
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,440
...of your opposite-sex sex partner.

661
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,859
We're not dating, Mom.

662
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,820
And don't worry about
not making us grandparents...

663
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,906
...although we were kind of hoping
you'd get knocked up...

664
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,450
...so we'd have a second shot
at raising kids.

665
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,828
Really do it right this time.

666
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,165
- Bye now.
- I dated a homosexual once.

667
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,543
For a long time, actually.
A long time.

668
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:15,422
Dear God, dear Lord, tell me you did
not marry and have children with him.

669
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,132
No.

670
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,341
No, no, no.

671
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,552
Your father is as straight
as they come.

672
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,054
A little too straight,
if you know what I mean.

673
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,724
I don't.
Can you shut the door, please?

674
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,438
Okay, door's right over there.
Keep going.

675
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:35,984
- Take it down.
- Go take that out to Dad. Nice.

676
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,745
"Just in case you don't shop at Target.
Then you can go screw yourself.

677
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,496
Brandon."

678
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,631
Hi, Rhi.

679
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:01,051
Is it true you got with Brandon
at Melody Dipshit's party?

680
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,637
Is that what people
are saying happened?

681
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,765
<i>That's what everyone
is saying happened.</i>

682
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,809
Well, then I guess that...
I guess that's true.

683
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,896
Just because you lost your virginity
doesn't mean you can go...

684
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,775
- ...throwing your cat at everybody.
- I'm not throwing my cat at everybody.

685
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,945
I had to hear from Jackie Rudetsky.

686
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,780
<i>Do you know
how embarrassing that is?</i>

687
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:26,284
Finding out you slept with some
gay dude from Jackie Rudetsky?

688
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,827
Must've been embarrassing.

689
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,746
<i>Why didn't you tell me
you were going?</i>

690
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,915
I would've come with
and held your hair.

691
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,209
Are you really making this
about you right now?

692
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,963
- You're starting to get a reputation.
- You're coming off as a little pious.

693
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,839
You're pissing me off
more than usual.

694
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,967
<i>I think it's
a best friend's duty...</i>

695
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:46,471
...to let her know that everyone, and
I do mean everyone, is calling her...

696
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,223
...a dirty skank.

697
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,143
Well, do you think I'm a dirty skank?

698
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,230
You know, I didn't wanna believe it,
but I guess it's true.

699
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,149
<i>That is your identifier.</i>

700
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,735
And you're a jealous virgin.

701
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,070
So...

702
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,991
<i>People thought
I was a dirty skank?</i>

703
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,327
<i>Fine, I'd be the dirtiest skank
they'd ever seen.</i>

704
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,351
Shit.

705
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,443
Is everything all right? It sounds like
you're having sex in here...

706
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,196
...which can't be true, due to the fact
that you have a homosexual boyfriend.

707
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,782
He's not my boyfriend.

708
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,661
Hey, no judgment.
All God's children. It's fine.

709
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,539
I was gay once for a while.

710
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,876
No big deal.
We all do it. It's okay.

711
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,961
Dad, can you just
shut the door, please?

712
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,212
You all right, buddy?

713
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,050
Yeah.

714
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,635
Give them hell.

715
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,766
- Hey, Anson.
- Hey.

716
00:39:54,934 --> 00:40:00,438
I just realized the funniest thing.
My name is an anagram for "I love".

717
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,441
What's a...? What's an anagram?

718
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,901
Look it up, big boy.

719
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,445
What's your problem?

720
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,197
You wanna know
what my problem is?

721
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:13,201
No. That was a rhetorical question.
I don't wanna know anything from you.

722
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,370
We are not friends anymore.

723
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,330
We are officially over.

724
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,957
Oh, rats.

725
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:23,336
I want my Juicy sweatshirt back. It was
too loose around your chest anyway.

726
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,547
Burn.

727
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,632
- Stop.
- What?

728
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,987
What are you doing?

729
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,781
Nothing.

730
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,954
Don't forget,
tomorrow's Earth Day.

731
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:02,333
Guys, we have a problem:
Olive Penderghast.

732
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,169
- We need to pray for her.
- Amen.

733
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,921
But we also need to
get her the hell out of here.

734
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,131
Amen.

735
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,508
You heard what happened
at Melody Bostic's.

736
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,553
- I was there. I heard the whole thing.
- That's not something...

737
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,681
- ...you need to advertise, Kurt.
- Sorry. But I was.

738
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,460
I tried to witness to her,

739
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:21,020
but this girl is defiant
to any type of help.

740
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,855
Does anybody here think they can
talk to her, get her to see...

741
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,065
...what she's doing is wrong?

742
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,946
- It's okay. - I'm sorry,
you guys. This is so stupid.

743
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,450
No, it's not, Marianne.
It's real.

744
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,701
- It's real.
- Yeah, it is.

745
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,745
Jesus tells us to love everyone.

746
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:43,500
I mean, even the whores and
the homosexuals, but it's just so hard.

747
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:48,213
It's so hard because they keep
doing it over and over again.

748
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,965
Make me a promise.

749
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,718
Make God a promise,
right here and right now...

750
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,846
...that we will remain
pure and chaste until marriage.

751
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,056
We promise.

752
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,559
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

753
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:06,105
I love you guys. God loves you guys.
Now, let's change lives today.

754
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,316
- Micah?
- Let's do it.

755
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,051
<i>I didn't know what they
were so upset about.</i>

756
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,096
<i>I put an A on my wardrobe
just like they asked.</i>

757
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,599
<i>Maybe it was because I was wearing
clothes that were two sizes too small.</i>

758
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,101
Hey, Olive!

759
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,981
You left your glass slipper
at the party the other night.

760
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,401
Yeah, and I got pumpkin
all over my dress too.

761
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,779
Nice. Solid joke.

762
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,490
It sucks because we could've
revisited Melody's bedroom.

763
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,742
Oh, my God,
that was Melody Bostic's house.

764
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,620
- Yeah.
- I can't believe you remember that.

765
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:06,291
Well, yeah, come on. Who doesn't
remember their first almost-kiss?

766
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,420
Hey, Olive.

767
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,297
Evan. Hey, what's rocking?

768
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,965
Can I talk to you for a second?

769
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,842
Yeah, what's up?

770
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,845
Don't get mad, but Brandon told me
what you did for him.

771
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:22,807
Oh, well, rest assured,
it was equally as thrilling for me.

772
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,767
No, he told me the truth.

773
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,021
I was just hoping
you could do the same for me?

774
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,939
Goodbye, Evan.

775
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,900
Wait, wait. I can pay you.

776
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,862
I am about six seconds away
from slapping you so hard...

777
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,073
- ...your teeth will bleed.
- Can you do it in front of everyone?

778
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,369
I don't need your permission,
you know.

779
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,831
What?

780
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,626
I mean, at the rate you're going...

781
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,961
...I don't see how people
won't believe it.

782
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,547
- Are you threatening me?
- I'll give you 100 bucks.

783
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,132
You are repugnant.

784
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,384
That's the problem.

785
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,012
Never mind.

786
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,182
I'm sorry I asked.

787
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,066
I knew it wouldn't work.

788
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,942
I'm just a fat piece of shit.

789
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,446
When will high school end already?

790
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,870
Shit.

791
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:30,500
I want a $100 gift card deposited
into my locker by noon tomorrow.

792
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,878
Preferably to the Gap, but I will
also take Amazon.com or OfficeMax.

793
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:38,049
Actually, make it OfficeMax.
I have my eye on a label maker.

794
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,843
We did not have sex, okay?

795
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,055
I let you fondle my chest,
and it was a glorious moment for you...

796
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,392
...unmatched by anything
you've experienced, including cake.

797
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,601
Got it?

798
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,729
Wait a minute.
A hundred bucks for second base?

799
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,357
- Yeah.
- Doesn't that seem a little steep?

800
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:58,236
Can we throw in, like, some
butt action or some pants rubbing?

801
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,988
- What are you, 9?
- Whatever. Are you in?

802
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,201
- Whatever.
- Deal, then.

803
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,495
Thanks, Olive.

804
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,288
You know, the sad thing is, Evan...

805
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,918
...if you'd been a gentleman
and maybe asked me on a date...

806
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,294
...I might've said yes.

807
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:18,089
Really?
Do you wanna go out with me?

808
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,799
Not now I don't, shit-dick.

809
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,098
<i>It should come as no surprise that the
rumor I was soliciting sex for money...</i>

810
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,517
<i>...spread around the school
faster than...</i>

811
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:33,354
<i>Well, faster than the first rumor
about me spread.</i>

812
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,234
Guys, come over here.

813
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,138
She'll do stuff for money.
Around the world...

814
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,475
<i>But for people who knew the truth,
I was open for business.</i>

815
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:15,104
<i>And whether I liked it or not,
I had a lot of customers.</i>

816
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,649
<i>Phil Lord gave me
100 bucks from Best Buy...</i>

817
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:22,320
<i>...so he could tell people
we hooked up behind the library.</i>

818
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,239
<i>I got $50 from T.J. Maxx
so that Eric Ling could say...</i>

819
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,034
<i>...we got it on during Chemistry.</i>

820
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,954
<i>Ninety dollars from Panda Express
so Ryan Dukes could tell people...</i>

821
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,833
<i>...I showed him mine,
but he did not show me his.</i>

822
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,294
<i>Chris Miller,
big spender that he is...</i>

823
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,006
<i>...gave me $40 worth of movie passes
for my pretend cowbell.</i>

824
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,467
<i>They had an expiration date
and were only good...</i>

825
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,469
<i>...at the stupid
foreign movie theater.</i>

826
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,242
<i>Hi. One for...</i>

827
00:46:48,743 --> 00:46:52,643
<i>...Der Scharlachrote Buchstabe.</i>

828
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,770
<i>But even that is better
than Sanjay Chandrasekhar.</i>

829
00:46:55,938 --> 00:47:00,066
Seriously? A coupon? Twenty percent
off to Bath & Body Works?

830
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,402
Is that how much our imaginary tryst
meant to you?

831
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,363
I fake rocked your world.

832
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,032
- It's all I can afford.
- How's that my problem, amigo?

833
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,202
<i>I knew he wasn't Latino,
but for some reason all these shady...</i>

834
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,663
<i>...backdoor deals
had me talking like Carlito.</i>

835
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,165
- Beat it, ese.
- Okay.

836
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,292
<i>Whatever happened to chivalry?</i>

837
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,379
Does it only exist in '80s movies?

838
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:25,633
<i>I want John Cusack holding
a boombox outside my window.</i>

839
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,427
<i>I wanna ride off on a lawn mower
with Patrick Dempsey.</i>

840
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:32,682
<i>I want Jake from Sixteen Candles
waiting outside the church for me.</i>

841
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,601
<i>I want Judd Nelson
thrusting his fist into the air...</i>

842
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,228
<i>...because he knows he got me.</i>

843
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,356
<i>Just once, I want my life
to be like an '80s movie.</i>

844
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,734
<i>Preferably one with a really awesome
musical number...</i>

845
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,945
<i>...for no apparent reason.</i>

846
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:51,033
But, no. No.
John Hughes did not direct my life.

847
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,995
So instead of all that...

848
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,373
...I get to save 15 cents...

849
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,376
...on a bottle of Juniper Breeze
Antibacterial Gel.

850
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,839
So if you're still with me,
and I'm hoping that most of you are...

851
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,758
...this brings us to part four.

852
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,597
How I, Olive Penderghast,
went from assumed trollop...

853
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,432
...to an actual home-wrecker.

854
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:20,605
- You wanted to see me?
- I did. Why don't you come in here?

855
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,155
What's going on?

856
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,617
- I'm accessorizing.
- Really?

857
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:36,329
I think you're taking your reading
assignment a little bit too seriously.

858
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:39,874
Well, I was really hoping
to get an A. Get it?

859
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,295
I'm hearing some rumors.

860
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,673
Well, those are true. I am considering
becoming an existentialist.

861
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,426
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Jeez.

862
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,889
When did teachers become
privy to idle adolescent gossip?

863
00:48:55,057 --> 00:49:00,895
That would be when everyone
is putting everything up on Facebook.

864
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,481
I don't know what
your generation's fascination is...

865
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,025
...with documenting
your every thought...

866
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,403
...but I can assure you
they're not all diamonds.

867
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,989
"Roman is having an okay day...

868
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:16,327
...and bought a Coke Zero
at the gas station.

869
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,912
Raise the roof."

870
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,330
Who gives a rat's ass?

871
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,832
He got a Coke Zero again?

872
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,168
That Roman. Incorrigible.

873
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:28,047
Listen, whatever this little act
is about, I just... I'm curious.

874
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,133
I really think you should consider
giving me extra credit...

875
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,593
...for going the extra mile.

876
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,763
I'm really attempting to understand
this puritanical ostracism...

877
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,975
- ...Hawthorne wrote about.
- You are one of the few that read it.

878
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,811
If I read one more paper
from one of your classmates...

879
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:46,607
...who talks about how hot she is in
the bathtub, her fake British accent...

880
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,820
...or, is she still married to
Ashton Kutcher, I'm gonna kill myself.

881
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,656
Why don't people just watch
the original movie like I did?

882
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,658
I know you read the book.

883
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,868
I did.

884
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:01,455
Listen, I want to apologize for
sending you to the principal's office.

885
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,125
Truthfully, and I'll deny it
if you say anything...

886
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,044
...I wanted to be cheering
with the rest of the students.

887
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,714
I don't know what it is about Nina.

888
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,632
I hate her.

889
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,842
I won't tell.

890
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,427
- I'll deny it if you do.
- Okay.

891
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,721
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

892
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,514
Stay golden.

893
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,226
- Hi, Mrs. Griffith.
- Hi, you. How are you?

894
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,729
A is for "awesome".

895
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,439
Yeah.

896
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,774
I've never seen that girl before.

897
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,818
That does not surprise me.

898
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,904
But I'm the guidance counselor.
I should know all the students.

899
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,574
Especially the ones
who dress like prostitutes.

900
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,452
- It's good to see you.
- Hey. How are you? Good.

901
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,914
No, stop. We're at school.
There are rules.

902
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,417
- Windows.
- Yeah, yeah.

903
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,753
Do me a favor, though.
Just talk to her.

904
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,713
I think she's going through
a phase.

905
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,424
That's not the girl
everyone's talking about, is it?

906
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,592
It is.

907
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,386
Oh, okay. Oh, this'll be good.
All right.

908
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,014
That snotty, Jesus-freak
office aide I have...

909
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,141
...has been bitching
about her incessantly.

910
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:06,604
They're all lies, but she could use
somebody to talk to anyway.

911
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,356
All right. Hey, what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

912
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,067
- You won't be there?
- Sorry.

913
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,278
I have an after-school session.
Kid brought a knife to school.

914
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,738
Well, be careful, all right?

915
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,365
It was a butter knife.
But you know what they say.

916
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,493
You know,
it's a gateway knife, so...

917
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,161
- All right, bye.
- Yeah. Bye.

918
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,081
I'm thinking about another gateway.
It's a...

919
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:28,959
Making spaghetti.

920
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,045
- That's great.
- With meat.

921
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,546
Enjoy eating your meat.

922
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,424
- And balls.
- Enjoy eating your balls.

923
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,685
Sharpening your pencils?

924
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,605
Getting them nice and sharp?

925
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:54,568
Sharpening them up? Look at you.
Look at you. So sharp.

926
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,029
Sharpening those pencils.
Sharp, sharp, sharp.

927
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,324
- God, that's sharp. I...
- Hey, Olive. You ready to come in?

928
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,370
Good job.

929
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,123
Well, the reason I called you in
was just so we could...

930
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,167
...sort of, you know, just chat
about what's going on.

931
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,962
You know, there is concern
from a few faculty members.

932
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,630
Your husband.

933
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,299
Olive, you're attempting
to make a statement.

934
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,678
I'm just a little confused
as to what exactly that is.

935
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,346
Am I in trouble?

936
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,974
Because, pursuant
to the student code of conduct...

937
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,810
...my hemline has never been
higher than my fingertips.

938
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,311
No, you're not in trouble.

939
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,021
I wanted to make sure you knew...

940
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,566
...if there's something
that you wanna talk about...

941
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,526
...you know, you can trust me.

942
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:39,655
If I open up to you, do you promise
this stays in confidence?

943
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,075
Yeah. I'm... See?
I'm the guidance counselor.

944
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,618
That's what I do.

945
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,037
I mean, I have a reputation
to uphold.

946
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,372
Don't you, though?

947
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:54,879
All right, listen, don't tell anyone
I'm doing this, please.

948
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,172
Here you go.

949
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,215
- Here you go.
- I really don't need those.

950
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:01,760
Oh, you really do. Here you go.

951
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,512
Here you go. Okay?

952
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,433
I just don't want this thing you're
going through to define your life.

953
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,310
Olive, do what you gotta do. Okay?

954
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:13,981
Let your freak flag fly. Just make sure
you have an exit strategy.

955
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:18,110
Listen, Mrs. Griffith, I really...
I don't need these.

956
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,696
The pill is not 100 percent effective.

957
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,656
Ask some of your friends' parents.

958
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,409
Thank you for coming in.

959
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,999
Can you just send in the next person?
Thank you.

960
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,254
You're up, hoss.

961
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,341
Okay. Go. It's all right.

962
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,887
Everything's gonna be okay.

963
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,897
Don't you think it's a little strange
that your boyfriend is 22 years old...

964
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,192
- ...and still in high school?
- Not that it's any of your business...

965
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,735
...but he is here by choice.

966
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,200
It's his choice
that he's a fourth-year senior

967
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:03,865
that can't pass
any test he takes at all?

968
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,367
His choice. His? His?

969
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,576
Capital H?

970
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,247
If God wanted him to graduate, God
would've given him the right answers.

971
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,169
I'm sorry.
You gotta be shitting me, woman.

972
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,089
Okay. So why was he blubbering
like a baby?

973
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,085
Is he struggling
with his sexuality?

974
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,761
No, you insensitive
rhymes-with-witch.

975
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:28,055
His parents are
going through a divorce.

976
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,269
Okay.

977
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:44,822
You know,
sometimes our boyfriend's parents...

978
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,448
...they get divorced, you know?

979
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,577
And it's important to remember
it's not your fault.

980
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:51,787
So I gotta go.

981
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:57,710
But they go to our church.
What will people say?

982
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:06,343
How long do these embraces usually
last? Because I gotta go, but I...

983
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,179
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes, I'm gonna be okay.

984
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,056
Mrs. Griffith is amazing...

985
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,977
...and she's gonna help Micah,
and everything's gonna be okay.

986
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,815
See? All right, that's the spirit.
Everything's gonna be okay.

987
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,650
Okay.

988
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,991
Wait. Why are you even
being so nice to me?

989
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,995
I did it.

990
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,122
I got through to you.

991
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:41,128
I'm so sorry about everything I said.
I am so, so sorry.

992
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,507
I mean, I really want us to be friends.
Can we please be friends?

993
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,468
Absolutely.

994
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,891
<i>And for a day,
we were actually really good friends.</i>

995
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,977
<i>I was kind of starting to think
things were gonna turn around.</i>

996
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,937
Olive!

997
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,523
- Friend.
- Hey, friend.

998
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,400
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you more.

999
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:06,737
<i>She texted me in first period.</i>

1000
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,830
<i>By second period,
we apparently had private jokes.</i>

1001
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,208
Olive. Olive.

1002
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,130
<i>Tragedy struck in Wood Shop.</i>

1003
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,424
<i>It wasn't because
someone sawed off a thumb...</i>

1004
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,093
<i>...which has happened.</i>

1005
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,137
Micah is in the hospital.
He is in so much pain.

1006
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:35,432
The nurse didn't know
what was wrong.

1007
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,102
There, there.

1008
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,486
It hurts so bad, Mommy.

1009
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,239
Well, it's just what I thought.
Chlamydia.

1010
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,865
No.

1011
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:55,619
Who have you been screwing?
Tell me.

1012
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:59,790
Tell me now
or I will kill you right here.

1013
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,293
Olive. Olive Penderghast!

1014
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,216
Olive. Olive Penderghast.

1015
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,718
I have to call you back.
Okay. Bye-bye.

1016
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,096
Goddamn it.

1017
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,559
Chlamydia?!

1018
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,771
That bitch!

1019
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,567
- Olive?
- Hey.

1020
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:32,448
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Goddamn it.

1021
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,659
<i>I panicked.</i>

1022
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,745
I said I got it
from Olive Penderghast.

1023
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:42,040
I know, but what was
I supposed to say?

1024
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,877
You know, and then my mom
tells Marianne's mom.

1025
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,713
I did. I tried to blame it
on their divorce...

1026
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,966
...but my mom is not buying it.

1027
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,844
That's it. I have to tell them.

1028
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:58,015
No, I do not care that you
gave me chlamydia. I don't!

1029
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:02,728
I love you and I want to be with you,
and nobody can stop us.

1030
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,773
<i>Not my mother, not Marianne,
and not even the school board...</i>

1031
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,276
...or the president of the Americas!

1032
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,864
Oh, God.

1033
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,455
What? What do you want?
What do you want?

1034
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,207
Just go.

1035
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,504
Perfect. Just perfect.

1036
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,299
I'm sorry, I just...
I was looking for Marianne.

1037
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,426
Did she say anything
about being mad at me?

1038
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,386
She just smacked
the bejesus out of me.

1039
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:39,431
No, that's my fault.
I'm so sorry, Olive. I'm sorry.

1040
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,477
But I messed up, okay?
I just goddamn shit...

1041
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:48,148
...goddamn messed up
really goddamn shit bad.

1042
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,234
Goddamn. Shit, goddamn.

1043
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:55,330
Okay. Don't get me wrong
because I love it...

1044
00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:56,715
...but I just, I don't think

1045
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,409
you're supposed to use that kind
of language in front of a student.

1046
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,578
You know what else you're not
supposed to do, is sleep with them.

1047
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,997
But that didn't stop me.
Goddamn shit.

1048
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,501
Wait. You... Oh, my God.

1049
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:11,088
But I'm not... I'm not judging
you or anything, but, oh, my God.

1050
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:15,175
I... Wait, what does that
have to do with me?

1051
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,427
You should know
that my marriage is not great.

1052
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,263
We haven't slept together
in months.

1053
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,472
In months, all right?

1054
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,685
Finally, this great-looking guy comes
in and he's nice to me, you know?

1055
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,061
And he's not a minor.

1056
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:30,440
This is legal. It's legal
because he's been here forever, okay?

1057
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,402
He's not the sharpest
Christian in the Bible, all right?

1058
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,780
And then he finds out
that he has chlamydia.

1059
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,908
And so then he's telling
everybody that it was you.

1060
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,785
He didn't want me
to lose my job...

1061
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,372
...and he doesn't wanna get in trouble
either, so he said it's you.

1062
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,748
I'm sorry.

1063
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,919
But I'll... I'm gonna fix it, Olive.
Okay? I'll tell everyone.

1064
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:55,966
I'm gonna tell everyone that it's me.
Okay? I'll just... I'll lose my job.

1065
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:59,803
And, you know, whatever else I lose,
and then that's okay.

1066
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,560
<i>Maybe it was becoming a habit
of mine to help the downtrodden...</i>

1067
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,687
<i>...or maybe I just couldn't stand
to see...</i>

1068
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,772
<i>...my favorite teacher's
marriage crumble.</i>

1069
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,150
<i>Either way, I decided to help.</i>

1070
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,819
I could have chlamydia.

1071
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:21,450
I mean, I could have easily given it
to Micah.

1072
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,493
I mean, who knows?

1073
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:26,580
Women oftentimes
don't show symptoms.

1074
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,082
And the whole world knows
I've been whoring around.

1075
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,792
No, you haven't. No, you haven't.

1076
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,298
Because a real whore can't admit it
to herself, much less others. Trust me.

1077
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,594
Call Micah.

1078
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:44,139
Tell him he is an ass and
he owes me so big for this, but also...

1079
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,142
...tell him I confessed
to giving him chlamydia.

1080
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:57,194
Getting a lot of hugs today.

1081
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,322
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- Get out of here!

1082
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,202
<i>I guess I shouldn't be too shocked
these people...</i>

1083
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,120
<i>...wanted my diseased ass
out of there.</i>

1084
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,330
Save yourself, Olive.

1085
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,333
<i>The funny thing is, the whole time
this all was going down...</i>

1086
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,544
<i>...I couldn't help but think
I could've come up with better signs.</i>

1087
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,546
<i>Although you gotta love
the Quiznos guy.</i>

1088
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,883
<i>That's the one thing
that trumps religion: Capitalism.</i>

1089
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,468
Why are you doing this?

1090
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,762
I'm trying to make this school
a better place.

1091
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,223
Start a petition to get rid
of the lead paint.

1092
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,724
New Honey Chicken at Quiznos.

1093
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:30,143
- Not now, Quiznos.
- You're a slut.

1094
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,478
You're going down, Olive.

1095
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:34,981
If this is because I'm more popular
than you, then I think what you're...

1096
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,651
Let's not mistake popularity
for infamy.

1097
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,696
- You don't wanna burn, do you?
- I'll be praying for you.

1098
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,452
Sorry.

1099
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,581
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm awesome. I'm awesome.

1100
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,250
Screw all these people, Olive.

1101
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,585
Haven't you heard?

1102
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,921
I already did.

1103
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:01,091
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- What you're doing is wrong.

1104
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,427
You're going to hell!

1105
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,434
<i>So they got Rhiannon.</i>

1106
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,854
<i>Never underestimate the power
of extremists like Marianne.</i>

1107
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:17,774
<i>They sense any weakness,
they pounce like jungle cats.</i>

1108
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,694
<i>And the whack pack
just gets bigger and bigger.</i>

1109
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,946
<i>But at least they have a pack.</i>

1110
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,992
<i>I was used to being by myself,
but I had never felt more alone.</i>

1111
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,620
<i>I thought I should look into what they
were running around thumping about.</i>

1112
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,081
- Do you have a religion section?
- It's over there.

1113
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,250
- Can I help you with something?
- The Bible.

1114
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,378
That's in bestsellers,
right next to Twilight.

1115
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,340
<i>I didn't have time
to read the whole thing...</i>

1116
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,050
<i>...because it's, like,
600 pages.</i>

1117
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,719
<i>Single-spaced.</i>

1118
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,472
<i>And as every war
that's ever been fought can tell you...</i>

1119
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,640
<i>...there are many ways
you can interpret it.</i>

1120
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,769
<i>Except the Civil War.
That was pure racism.</i>

1121
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,270
<i>So I went to find an expert.</i>

1122
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:59,816
<i>But really, I just kind of
wanted someone to talk to.</i>

1123
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:04,821
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1124
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,240
I think that's how you
start these things.

1125
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,659
I'm just going off
what I've seen in movies.

1126
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:11,870
Where do I even start?

1127
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,291
I've been pretending to be...

1128
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,335
What is the Catholic way
of phrasing this?

1129
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,337
A harlot?

1130
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:25,175
A harlot. It's not that
I've actually been doing...

1131
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:29,012
...the things that people have
been saying I've been doing...

1132
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,306
...but then again,
I'm not denying them either.

1133
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,893
So I was just wondering,
is that wrong?

1134
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,023
It's just that a lot of people
have been asking me to do things...

1135
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,400
...and I thought it was okay

1136
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:46,364
because it wasn't real,
you know?

1137
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,283
It was make-believe.

1138
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,869
And no one was getting hurt...

1139
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,751
...but a lot of people hate me now.

1140
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,757
I kind of hate me too.

1141
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,932
I might be wrong...

1142
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,726
...but aren't you
supposed to say something?

1143
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,937
Tell me to say 10 Hail Marys,
pay a fine...

1144
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,606
...advance token to nearest railroad?
Hello?

1145
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,402
<i>Should've seen that one coming.</i>

1146
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:35,704
<i>Luckily, I live in a town
with many different places of worship.</i>

1147
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,415
<i>So I went to find one
with a real live human being.</i>

1148
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:39,875
Can I help you?

1149
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,669
Yeah, I was just wondering
if there's a minister around.

1150
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,297
Is it not a minister?

1151
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,507
A Reverend? A wizard?

1152
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,551
It's a pastor, and he's here.

1153
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,596
How can I help you today?

1154
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:56,099
I was wondering what your church's
stance on lying and adultery was.

1155
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,267
It's not a good thing.

1156
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:01,771
Oh, I agree, wholeheartedly.
But, then... Now, tell me this.

1157
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,356
Assuming there is a hell...

1158
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:06,651
Oh, the Christian Church recognizes
the existence of hell.

1159
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,112
Okay, so we'll just say
there's a "hell".

1160
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,406
There is. Just so we're clear.

1161
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,076
- Okay. So for argument's sake...
- No, there's no argument. It's there.

1162
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,830
Right below our feet,
right above the Orient. It's there.

1163
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,753
Then what would be worse,
lying or adultery?

1164
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,631
Or is lying about adultery
just like double whammy? Sorry.

1165
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,299
Come on.

1166
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,137
I'm sorry,
what did you say your name was?

1167
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:38,308
I didn't. I... You know what?
I'm just gonna...

1168
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,810
I'm just gonna go check out
Judaism because...

1169
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,979
- God. Two frames, really?
- Sorry.

1170
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:45,273
The Jews and I
have a lot in common.

1171
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:48,193
- Just fashion-wise and stuff.
- Off you go.

1172
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,404
<i>Yes, I had unwittingly
sought advice from the father...</i>

1173
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,657
<i>...of the leader of my lynch mob.</i>

1174
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:58,954
<i>What other complete and total idiot
can say that's happened to them?</i>

1175
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,251
<i>Okay, I've narrowed it down
to The Other Boleyn Girl...</i>

1176
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:08,088
...or The Bucket List. Huge hit.

1177
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,174
Why can't we watch a movie for kids?
You always get to pick.

1178
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:15,011
Because the Family Member
of the Week gets to pick the movie.

1179
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,764
Yeah, but you get Family Member
of the Week every week.

1180
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,432
And there's a reason for that.

1181
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,268
Yeah. You pick
Family Member of the Week.

1182
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:23,937
Are you accusing me of nepotism?

1183
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,260
Okay, it's The Bucket List.
This is it.

1184
01:06:26,265 --> 01:06:27,650
This is the greatest decision.

1185
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,944
I'm so happy with this decision.
That's what it's going to be.

1186
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:34,072
<i>All right, now, honey,
after we watch The Bucket List...</i>

1187
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,785
...remember to cross "Watch
The Bucket List" off our bucket list.

1188
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:39,995
Guys.

1189
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,550
I want you to know that if you
hear around town I have chlamydia,

1190
01:06:43,655 --> 01:06:45,292
that is totally false.

1191
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:47,961
Olive, do we need
to have the talk again?

1192
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,505
No. It's just a thing
that's going around.

1193
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,550
You know, nothing you're saying
is making me feel any better.

1194
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,386
Not to mention how you've been
dressing the last few days.

1195
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,430
No judgment,
but you look like a stripper.

1196
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:01,057
- Mom.
- A high-end stripper.

1197
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,851
For governors or athletes.

1198
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,352
But stripper, nonetheless.

1199
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,188
Oh, my God.
I'm just trying to mix it up a little.

1200
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,149
And I have no STDs, I promise you.

1201
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:11,776
Oh, that's great.
Daughter of the Year.

1202
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:13,737
If you hear anything
to the contrary...

1203
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:16,114
...come up with some funny retort
and walk away.

1204
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,075
Honey, you're kind of
starting to worry us a little.

1205
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:21,244
Should we be kind of
worried a little?

1206
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:23,246
I don't think so.

1207
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,374
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1208
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,419
Yeah. I got it all under control.

1209
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,671
- Okay.
- Okay.

1210
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,007
Then let's Bucket List this bitch.

1211
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,009
<i>The Bucket List, The Bucket List.</i>

1212
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,553
To say this whole thing
had taken over my life...

1213
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,181
...would be
a colossal understatement.

1214
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,601
<i>I actually reread The Scarlet Letter
to see how Hester dealt with it.</i>

1215
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:49,606
<i>And it turns out she bore
her punishment in humble silence...</i>

1216
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:52,942
...which are two concepts
I am not comfortable with.

1217
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,320
<i>With all the mythical play
I was getting...</i>

1218
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:58,490
<i>...I still actually hadn't been
asked out on a real date.</i>

1219
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:01,743
<i>People were jumping up and down
to say they'd slept with me...</i>

1220
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,370
<i>...but no one bothered
really trying to sleep with me.</i>

1221
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:07,457
<i>I was starting to think I actually
did have a gnome down there.</i>

1222
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,001
<i>- Until finally...
- Hey, Olive.</i>

1223
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,378
Hey, Anson. What's up?

1224
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,672
I was wondering
if you were busy tonight.

1225
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,759
Maybe wanna go out or something?

1226
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,386
What did you have in mind?

1227
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:23,264
I was thinking about getting
a hot-air balloon, you know...

1228
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,141
...bringing along some champagne...

1229
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:28,645
...and then possibly reading
some Sylvia Plath.

1230
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:32,190
Or we could just go
to The Lobster Shack...

1231
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,400
...because it's, you know,
a little easier.

1232
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:37,695
- I love The Lobster Shack.
- Good.

1233
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:39,322
Okay. It's a date, then.

1234
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,076
- Okay.
- Okay.

1235
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,539
So should I still bring
the Sylvia Plath or?

1236
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,666
No, we could stick our heads
in the oven...

1237
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,918
...if we run out of things
to talk about.

1238
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:53,670
That was...

1239
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,797
- Cool. All right. Well...
- Cool.

1240
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:05,974
You look really beautiful.

1241
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,851
Thank you.

1242
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,729
- You're a real gentleman.
- No.

1243
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:16,401
Just a guy having dinner
with a girl.

1244
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:31,207
Do you believe this whole thing
about lobster being an aphrodisiac?

1245
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,877
I did not know it was.

1246
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:36,504
Medical science really
has not substantiated claims...

1247
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:39,883
...that any particular food increases
sexual desire or performance...

1248
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,886
...but guys just spend and spend
to ply women with food...

1249
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:46,556
...they think is gonna get them lucky.
Which is funny, because, it's like...

1250
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,809
...what is sexy about
slurping back oysters? Nothing.

1251
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:53,563
Did you know some people actually
eat ground-up rhinoceros horn...

1252
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,774
...because it's thought to increase
the size of the male sex organ?

1253
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,902
That's not true at all.

1254
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,696
Spanish fly. Spanish fly.
You've heard of this? Yes?

1255
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,406
- Yes.
- Okay. That thing?

1256
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:05,700
Pulverized blister beetle. What?

1257
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,610
And it's illegal in the U.S..

1258
01:10:07,613 --> 01:10:09,413
Because if you eat
just a little bit too much...

1259
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,749
...it causes painful urination,
fever and bloody discharge.

1260
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,292
- Am I talking too much?
- No.

1261
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,170
You're just burning through
a lot of topics really fast.

1262
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:20,173
Shouldn't have had coffee
three weeks ago.

1263
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,382
I'm just kidding.

1264
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:25,386
Your Maine lobster
with crab and seafood stuffing.

1265
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,681
- I'm jealous.
- Thank you.

1266
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,726
Let's dig in. Right?

1267
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,316
I didn't know Woodchuck Todd
worked here.

1268
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,158
He's dressed like a lobster.

1269
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,245
I should start calling him
Lobster Todd.

1270
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,126
Shit.

1271
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,087
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What? What's wrong?

1272
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,755
- Rhiannon's over there.
- So?

1273
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,174
She's been in love with you
since 1st grade.

1274
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,885
- She's my best friend.
- I thought you weren't speaking.

1275
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,388
But that doesn't mean
she's not my best friend.

1276
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,098
Or that I should be out with you.

1277
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,642
Rhi and I don't have
anything in common.

1278
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,560
- And you and I do?
- Yeah.

1279
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:17,814
- Like what?
- Like I hate Marianne Bryant too.

1280
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,817
If that's our connection,
I should date the entire school.

1281
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,735
Haven't you?

1282
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,489
No. No, I haven't.

1283
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:31,577
Okay, she can't see us.
Check. Check.

1284
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:34,038
Can you just...? Excuse me? Hi.

1285
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:38,543
I just remembered
I am so allergic to shellfish.

1286
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,004
I forget that my respiratory system
will collapse.

1287
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:43,423
- I have a gift certificate.
Keep the tip. - Thanks.

1288
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,133
I'm sorry, but we have to go.

1289
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,052
- Go. Go. Come on.
Come on. - Okay.

1290
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,804
Go, go, go.

1291
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,856
I'm sorry about that.

1292
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,569
I've got something for you.

1293
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:08,197
Two hundred dollars
to The Home Depot.

1294
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:16,122
I didn't realize this was a...

1295
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:20,043
I know it sounds kind of lame, but they
really do have some awesome stuff.

1296
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,712
I bought my air compressor there.

1297
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:26,883
So, what did we do on this date?

1298
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,634
Whatever 200 bucks gets me.

1299
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,098
- That's not really how it works.
- It's okay.

1300
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,392
Stop.

1301
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,228
I'm not really having sex with people
for money.

1302
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:43,358
I'm saying I'm having sex for money,
but I'm not having sex for money.

1303
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,193
It's okay.
It's all right. Come on.

1304
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,028
- Stop. No, no.
- What?

1305
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,446
Stop!

1306
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,199
Come on, just relax.
Come on, babe. It's all right.

1307
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,452
God. Asshole.

1308
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,876
What are you doing?
I paid you.

1309
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:04,754
Now you didn't.

1310
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:09,759
Come on, this is bullshit.

1311
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,973
Goddamn it.

1312
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,935
Hey, Olive.

1313
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,230
Todd, hi.

1314
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:30,988
- Hey, you all right?
- I just have something in my eye.

1315
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:34,534
Like a twig, you know, or a branch,
or a contact, or something.

1316
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,170
I didn't know
you wore contacts.

1317
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:38,956
I don't, which is why
I was tearing up.

1318
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:43,835
Olive, hey.
Let me drive you home.

1319
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,637
Do you wanna talk about it?

1320
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:02,395
What's to say?
Everybody thinks I'm a whore...

1321
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,773
...and for the first time,
I'm starting to believe it.

1322
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:06,983
What?

1323
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,986
Don't act like you don't know
what people are saying about me.

1324
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,989
I know what people are saying.
Doesn't mean I believe them.

1325
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,991
- Who told you?
- No one.

1326
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:18,411
No one had to tell me that once upon
a time, there was a scared kid...

1327
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:22,415
...at a party in a dark room
who was not ready for his first kiss.

1328
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:27,044
And, you know, there was
this amazing girl who lied for him.

1329
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:30,131
I still can't believe
you remember that.

1330
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:36,429
You know, sometimes I pretend
you were my first real kiss.

1331
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,515
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1332
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,352
- Who was?
- It was Rhiannon.

1333
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,229
- What?
- She must have told you.

1334
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:49,609
Yeah, it was... I think it was, like,
a year after that or something.

1335
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:52,612
It sucked, by the way.
She was, like:

1336
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:55,031
That bitch.

1337
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,909
Oh, my God,
she knew how I felt about you.

1338
01:14:58,076 --> 01:15:00,953
- How do you feel about me?
- And here I am feeling so bad.

1339
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:02,330
That's just perfect.

1340
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,874
Wait, hold on a second.
How do you feel about me?

1341
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,792
"Felt."

1342
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,544
I said "felt".

1343
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,633
Because I thought I...
I thought I heard "feel".

1344
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,426
- No, it was "felt".
- All right.

1345
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,637
How do you know where I live?

1346
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,138
We used to carpool.

1347
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,975
Yeah, in 2nd grade. What, are you
like a savant for people's addresses?

1348
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:25,228
Just for people who I think are cool.

1349
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,064
- You think I'm cool?
- I do.

1350
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:31,526
And I think you're pretty and smart.

1351
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:34,612
Did you form this opinion
prior to my little transformation?

1352
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,447
Way prior.

1353
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:39,659
Why didn't that rumor spread?

1354
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:41,869
I like to keep my business
to myself.

1355
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,038
Notoriety, for whatever reason...

1356
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:47,083
...never seems to benefit the noted,
it's only the "notees".

1357
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,419
Where were you two weeks ago?

1358
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:56,509
Olive.

1359
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:02,557
If I promise not to tell anyone,
could I kiss you right now?

1360
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,020
No.

1361
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:12,275
- Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry. - Oh, no.

1362
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,569
I just mean, not like this.

1363
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,613
I don't wanna kiss you with mascara
running down my face...

1364
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,283
...and some horndog guy
just having tried...

1365
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,494
...to stick his tongue
down my throat.

1366
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:27,081
I've wanted to kiss you
since 8th grade...

1367
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,418
...but I want it to be perfect.

1368
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,088
And right now, my life is a mess.

1369
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:37,842
I need to get my business in order
before I drag you into it.

1370
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,303
What if I told you
I wanna be dragged into it?

1371
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,847
I could help, maybe.

1372
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:12,793
Why now?

1373
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,963
Why are you all of a sudden
into me now?

1374
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,256
I don't know.

1375
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:21,135
I haven't overanalyzed it,
like you're about to.

1376
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:29,226
- Good night, Olive.
- Good night, Lobster Todd.

1377
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:34,607
<i>Now that I knew there were decent
and goodhearted people out there...</i>

1378
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,359
<i>...the lies had to stop.</i>

1379
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:38,610
<i>I knew there was only
one person I could count on</i>

1380
01:17:38,615 --> 01:17:40,030
to set the story straight:

1381
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,197
<i>Brandon.</i>

1382
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:44,617
<i>I'd helped him, and even though
it would destroy his new reputation...</i>

1383
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:47,328
<i>...as a straight stud,
I knew he'd help me.</i>

1384
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,122
Oh, my God. Did you hear that
Brandon ran away from home?

1385
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,709
Yeah, totally. He left his parents
a note that said, "I'm gay, bitches"...

1386
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:57,046
...and then he skipped town
with some big, hulking black guy.

1387
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,840
My apologies to Mark Twain.

1388
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,092
- Wait, huh?
- What?

1389
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,219
- You said something.
- You said something.

1390
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,262
You said something,
so I came back.

1391
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,889
- You're funny. Okay.
- Call me.

1392
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:10,226
<i>I went to everyone I'd helped
and begged them to say it wasn't true.</i>

1393
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,561
No way. I gave you money.

1394
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:16,357
You gave me a gift card to AutoZone.
I don't even have a car.

1395
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,317
I thought it'd be aspirational.

1396
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:22,697
Evan, please do this for me, all right?
I did that for you. Do this for me.

1397
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,783
I don't want people to know
I didn't go to second base with you.

1398
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,953
Do you know how many girls
I've hooked up with because of that?

1399
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,663
Girls are almost as dumb as boys.

1400
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:33,541
Oh, yes, they are.

1401
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:38,421
<i>It gets worse.</i>

1402
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:40,214
"Honor your father
and your mother."

1403
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,801
<i>Due to his condition, Micah was sent
on a visit to his grandparents...</i>

1404
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,428
<i>...in Palatka, Florida.</i>

1405
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:48,764
<i>And if there's one thing worse
than chlamydia, it's Florida.</i>

1406
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:50,725
"...be guilty of adultery."

1407
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,935
Get your hands
out of your berries, boy.

1408
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,104
<i>Olive, life is full of choices.</i>

1409
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:58,524
I made a bad one.
But then, so did you.

1410
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:02,027
But I see no other alternative
than to just live with the guilt.

1411
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:05,531
My guilt stems from my indiscretion
and yours for lying.

1412
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:09,827
We made our choices.
Now, we just have to let it ride.

1413
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:14,290
Or I could just tell everyone the truth
and get you fired and put in jail.

1414
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:17,084
Okay, first of all, he is of age, okay?

1415
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,462
It's perfectly legal
in the state of California.

1416
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:22,214
I checked. He is 21 in eight months.

1417
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:25,301
And secondly, let's play the Who
Would You Believe game, okay?

1418
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:28,846
Why don't you ask yourself, if you
were an adult, who would you believe?

1419
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,098
Who would you believe?
Who would you believe?

1420
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,434
Who would you believe? Who?

1421
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,357
Thank you for coming in.

1422
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:48,073
<i>Yeah, Mrs. Griffith was pure evil, but
I still shouldn't have done what I did.</i>

1423
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:51,035
Your wife has chlamydia,
and she's sleeping with a student...

1424
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,829
...and she gave it to him,
and she's trying to blame me.

1425
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:56,707
What?

1426
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,509
I'm sorry.

1427
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:06,010
I'm sorry.

1428
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,762
Mr. Griffith,
if you ever see this...

1429
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:15,851
...just know that I was wrong
to tell you that in that way. At all.

1430
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:18,062
I shouldn't have done it.

1431
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,190
<i>And I don't even feel bad
for lying for your wife.</i>

1432
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:26,862
<i>But I hate myself for telling you
the truth. I am so sorry.</i>

1433
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:31,158
<i>With my words, even though
they were true, I ended a marriage.</i>

1434
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:35,788
<i>Looking back, that's the thing
I regret the most.</i>

1435
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:47,633
So now everyone that knows the truth
is either gone or they won't fess up.

1436
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:52,805
And Marianne Bryant and her
disciples are demanding my head.

1437
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:56,559
The messed-up thing is I would not put
it past Principal Gibbons to expel me.

1438
01:20:56,726 --> 01:20:58,894
I had a similar situation
when I was your age.

1439
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:00,729
What? Everyone called you a slut?

1440
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,983
I had a horrible reputation and
people said awful things about me.

1441
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:06,402
- Why?
- Because I was a slut.

1442
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:10,990
I slept with a whole bunch of people.
A slew, a heap, a peck. Mostly guys.

1443
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:13,450
- Mom.
- Sorry, I got around.

1444
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:16,620
Before I met Dad,
I had incredibly low self-worth.

1445
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:20,374
Do me a favor and just stuff this down
my throat until I asphyxiate to death.

1446
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:23,043
- It's true. It is.
- I want to die.

1447
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:25,546
It's true.
I was quite the contortionist.

1448
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,757
I could do this thing. I could go...
I mean, my leg all the way...

1449
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:31,218
Stop. Can you stop?
Don't show me.

1450
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:34,471
- Can you not see that I'm a mess?
- No, you're not, Olive.

1451
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,390
You're wonderful.

1452
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:39,101
And you'll handle this
the same way I did.

1453
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,729
With an incontrovertible
sense of humor.

1454
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:45,441
But you're much smarter
than I am...

1455
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:48,694
...so you'll come out of this
much better than I did.

1456
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:52,615
Thank you, Mom.

1457
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:58,454
- I could get my leg so far back.
- No, no, no. Stop it.

1458
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:01,457
<i>So it was time to put an end
to all this once and for all...</i>

1459
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,250
<i>...by telling my side
of the story.</i>

1460
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,544
<i>And that's why I decided
to do this webcast.</i>

1461
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:08,005
So here we go.

1462
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,300
Part five.

1463
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,594
Not with a fizzle, but with a bang.

1464
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:17,640
<i>Today we had yet another
one of our ridiculous pep rallies.</i>

1465
01:22:17,807 --> 01:22:20,976
<i>Todd convinced the band to play
the sexiest song in their repertoire.</i>

1466
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:24,730
<i>I needed to pique everyone's interest
to get them to go home and log on.</i>

1467
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:28,275
<i>I had one outfit left and I figured
about 30 seconds to do it.</i>

1468
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:31,195
<i>Plus I really wanted
my own awesome musical number...</i>

1469
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:33,864
<i>...for no apparent reason.</i>

1470
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:39,828
Is that Olive?

1471
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:06,290
This was just a free preview.

1472
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:12,087
For the main event, log on to
www.FreeOlive.com tonight at 6 p.m.

1473
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:15,507
And I know it interferes with
the basketball game but, come on...

1474
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:17,760
...would you rather cheer on
the Woodchucks...

1475
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,137
...or watch me do one?

1476
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:24,892
What do you think you're doing?
Get to my office right now.

1477
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,687
I can't, because I have a date with the
guy I like and the rest of the school.

1478
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,725
I think before you expel me,

1479
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,067
you might wanna talk
to Mrs. Griffith...

1480
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,943
...because I think she might
talk you into letting me stay.

1481
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,613
Go, Woodchucks!

1482
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:50,084
And here you all are...

1483
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,128
...waiting outside the bedroom door
for me to kiss Todd...

1484
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:55,839
<i>...listening to me pretend
to have sex with Brandon...</i>

1485
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,217
<i>...paying me to lie for you...</i>

1486
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,427
<i>...and calling me
every name in the book.</i>

1487
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:03,388
<i>You know, it was just like Hester
in The Scarlet Letter.</i>

1488
01:25:03,556 --> 01:25:06,058
<i>Except that's the one thing
the movies don't tell you:</i>

1489
01:25:06,226 --> 01:25:11,438
How shitty it feels to be an outcast.
Warranted or not.

1490
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,699
How did you know I love this song?

1491
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:24,159
I guessed.

1492
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:27,746
I see you've been watching my live
webcast. It's still going on, you know.

1493
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:31,291
Screw them. They've had
enough of you. Figuratively speaking.

1494
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:34,461
I borrowed my neighbor's mower.
I came right over.

1495
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:35,671
That almost rhymed.

1496
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:38,382
I know. I spent a minute on it.

1497
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,551
I'll be right down.

1498
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,012
That's Todd.

1499
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:46,190
Not that I owe you guys
any more confessions,

1500
01:25:46,194 --> 01:25:49,144
but I really like this guy...

1501
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:53,564
<i>...and I might even lose my virginity
to him.</i>

1502
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,150
I don't know when it'll happen.

1503
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:59,361
You know, it might be five minutes
from now or tonight...

1504
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:03,448
...or six months from now
or maybe on our wedding night.

1505
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:08,495
But the really amazing thing is,
it is nobody's goddamn business.

1506
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:12,249
Come on, where's she going?

1507
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:14,626
I thought she was going
to take her clothes off.

1508
01:26:14,794 --> 01:26:17,337
Demi Moore took her clothes off.
This is bullshit.

1509
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:20,966
Come on. Are you kidding me?

1510
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,679
- Piss off.
- Come here, you punk.

1511
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,225
Jack?

1512
01:26:58,004 --> 01:27:00,422
<i>That's a mighty snug
little shelter, Huck.</i>

1513
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:02,049
<i>I judge it's all right.</i>

1514
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,259
<i>Here, Jim, I'll take my turn
at steering now.</i>

1515
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:06,803
<i>No, that's all right, Huck.
I like steering.</i>

1516
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,640
Blue Devils!
