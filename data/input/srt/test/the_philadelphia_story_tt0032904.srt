1
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:53,481
Tracy!

2
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:55,110
Tracy!

3
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:11,027
Tracy!

4
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,469
-How do you spell ""omelet""?
-Oh, you.

5
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:17,634
Ninety-four for the ceremony
and 506 for the reception.

6
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,768
l don´t know where
we´ll put them if it rains.

7
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:22,245
lt won´t rain.
Tracy won´t stand for it.

8
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:26,546
-Mother, how do you spell ""omelet""?
-O-M-M-E-L-E-T.

9
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:30,054
-l thought there was another ""L.""
-An omelet´s a funny wedding present.

10
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,990
-lt was a silver dish, dear.
-Bring some of that junk off the table.

11
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,493
Be an angel and get these
things out of the way.

12
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:38,552
Yes, darling.

13
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:44,601
This stinks.

14
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:47,538
Don´t say ""stinks,"" darling.

15
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:50,541
lf absolutely necessary, ""smells.""

16
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,634
These cards have
been changed again.

17
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:56,704
There must be a ghost in the house,
the ghost of bridegroom number one.

18
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:59,148
Don´t talk about Dexter
as though he were dead.

19
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:01,651
-He may as well be, for all Tracy cares.
-Right.

20
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,051
l wouldn´t say that.

21
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:06,056
lf l never see
Mr. C.K. Dexter Haven again, l´ll be--

22
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:08,456
-lsn´t that awful?
-They´re friends of your father´s.

23
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:12,657
What are they, tap dancers
or just musical comedy producers?

24
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:15,461
That´s hardly fair to your
father´s interest in the art.

25
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:19,630
Art, my eye! The art of putting up
$100,000 to display the shapely legs--

26
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:22,434
-That will do, Tracy.
-l give up.

27
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:28,011
lf you´d just face the facts
squarely, as l did--

28
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,539
We´d face the fact that neither of us
has proved to be a success as a wife.

29
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:36,053
We just picked the wrong
first husbands, that´s all.

30
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:39,318
Don´t let´s argue about it.
You wanted me to take a stand, so l did.

31
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,724
lt´s the only stand a woman could take
and keep her self-respect.

32
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,557
Yes, dear, l know.

33
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,530
Now l have my self-respect
and no husband.

34
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,762
You almost talk as though
you wanted him back.

35
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:52,701
He wouldn´t come back, probably.

36
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:56,172
Hey, it´s better this way, really.
You´ll see.

37
00:04:56,241 --> 00:05:00,268
Let´s forget about the past. We both
deserve some happiness, especially you.

38
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:02,108
-Darling.
-lsn´t George an angel?

39
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,580
-George is an angel.
-ls he handsome or is he not?

40
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:05,741
George is handsome.

41
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:09,309
-l liked Dexter.
-Why don´t you postpone the wedding?

42
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:11,988
-How?
-Get smallpox.

43
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:14,992
-Don´t put the idea in her head.
-George isn´t usually late.

44
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,324
-He´s waiting at the stables.
-Waiting--

45
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:20,831
-lf l don´t choke her before Saturday.
-lt´d postpone the wedding.

46
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:23,424
lt would not.
Be in the car when l get down.

47
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:26,203
She´s so mean about Dexter.

48
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:27,863
He was rather mean to her.

49
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,373
-Did he really sock her?
-Please, Dinah.

50
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,502
-Did he really?
-Darling, go out and wait in the car.

51
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:36,138
-The papers were full of ""innundo.""
-Of what?

52
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:39,274
Of ""innundo.""
""Cruelty and drunkenness,"" it said.

53
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:45,279
Mother, why won´t Tracy ask
her own father to the wedding?

54
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:48,053
Your sister has very definite
opinions about certain things.

55
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:49,616
She´s sort of--

56
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:53,130
Well, you know,
hard, isn´t she?

57
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:54,597
Certainly not.

58
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,897
Tracy sets exceptionally high standards
for herself, that´s all...

59
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,405
and other people aren´t always
quite apt to live up to them.

60
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,436
But don´t you think it´s stinking
not at least to want Father?

61
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:10,174
Yes, darling. Between ourselves,
l think it´s good and stinking.

62
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,649
Oh, l wish something would happen.

63
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:17,119
Nothing ever possibly
in the least ever happens here.

64
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,252
Mother...

65
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,424
how do you get smallpox?

66
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:26,259
Oh, Dinah, please go. Go.

67
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:44,609
This is Uncle Willie´s favorite:
Complete Surrender.

68
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:12,509
Where´d you get this
idiotic thing anyway?

69
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:18,310
Never play with fire, child,
particularly on the eve of your wedding.

70
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:20,783
You´re really a wicked old man,
aren´t you?

71
00:07:20,852 --> 00:07:22,717
Who takes this, your cook?

72
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:25,085
l love it. lt´s got
pictures of everything.

73
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:27,158
lt certainly has.

74
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:27,385
lt certainly has.

75
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:31,919
Who is that terribly attractive man?
Can Tracy pick ´em, or can she?

76
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:34,227
-lf you´re asking me--
-l´m not.

77
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:36,824
-Hello, darling.
-Hello!

78
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:40,428
-How do you like me?
-l adore you, but you look awful.

79
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:42,996
-Awful?
-Like something out of a shop window.

80
00:07:47,245 --> 00:07:49,008
Cut it out!
They´re new!

81
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,310
They´re new,
but they´re not going to be.

82
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,851
-There, that´s better.
-l don´t get it.

83
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,887
When l was a coal miner, l wanted
enough money to buy clean clothes.

84
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,582
Now that l´m general manager--

85
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:01,853
Dinah, is there anything
in there about the wedding?

86
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,053
-What do you mean?
-l thought maybe...

87
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:07,223
you being one of the oldest
families in Philadelphia...

88
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:09,528
and me getting fairly
important myself...

89
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:12,695
it´s luck, of course, but l--
What´s the matter?

90
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,262
""An average day in the life
of a congressman.

91
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,831
""The congressman´s wife.
The kitchen, where is prepared...

92
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:20,002
""one banana, sliced,
two fried eggs.

93
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:23,013
-""The congressman kisses his wife.""
-Lots of people like publicity.

94
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:27,040
Of all the filthy ideas, coming
into a private house with a camera.

95
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:31,782
George Kittredge, you get on that horse.
What do you think of that?

96
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:34,825
What would happen if someday
l got into politics?

97
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:37,691
-You´d be elected President.
-l don´t know about that.

98
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:40,026
-l mean about publicity.
-Not in my home.

99
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:42,225
You mean our home, don´t you?

100
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:46,802
Sorry, darling.
l mean very much our home.

101
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,180
Never mind, Eddie.
l´ll get up myself.

102
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,140
Steady, Bessie.

103
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:03,882
Whoa, Bessie. Whoa.

104
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:13,989
Steady, Bessie.

105
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,999
Grab the reins, George,
with the left hand.

106
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:22,662
-Put salt on his tail.
-Shut up.

107
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,173
Steady, Bessie.

108
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:27,367
There. Whoa, Bessie.

109
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,514
What´s the matter, Bessie?
You act worried.

110
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,608
Maybe it´s because his name is Jack.

111
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:38,479
Hi-ho, Silver.

112
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:53,762
That does the trick.
Hello, Joe.

113
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:55,362
-Hi, Mike.
-l won´t do it, Liz.

114
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,604
l´m gonna tell Sidney Kidd very plainly
l´m a writer, not a society snoop.

115
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:02,510
-l´m gonna tell him just that.
-Just that.

116
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:06,383
Let Kidd fire me!

117
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:09,648
Start writin´ short stories again.
That´s what l should be doin´.

118
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:12,246
-l´m gonna tell him just that.
-Just that.

119
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:19,556
Come in.

120
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:31,072
-l don´t think you´re being fair.
-No?

121
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:33,633
You´re treating me like you
treat all your other writers.

122
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:37,908
You really hate me,
don´t you, Connor?

123
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:40,917
No. l don´t like you
very much, though.

124
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:44,849
You hate me, l trust,
Miss lmbrie?

125
00:10:44,923 --> 00:10:48,586
No. l can´t afford to hate anybody.
l´m only a photographer.

126
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,353
Ask him to wait.

127
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:57,864
Your assignment will be Spy´s
most sensational achievement:

128
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:00,234
Tracy Lord.

129
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:03,331
Big game hunting in Africa,
fox hunting in Pennsylvania...

130
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:05,842
married on impulse
and divorced in a rage...

131
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,073
and always unapproachable
by the press.

132
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:11,308
""The Unapproachable Miss Lord.""

133
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,681
""The Philadelphia Story.""

134
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:18,552
""Closed were the portals
of snobbish fox hunting."" No.

135
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:21,319
""No hunter of foxes
is Spy magazine.""

136
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:24,020
Anyway, presented for
the first time, quote:

137
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:27,895
""A wedding day
inside mainline society.""

138
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:31,902
""Or what the kitchen maid saw
through the keyhole."" Unquote.

139
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,336
Writing´s your job.
l´m only the publisher.

140
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:37,067
All right, publisher,
take this. Quote:

141
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:41,134
""No hunter of buckshot in the rear
is cagey, crafty Connor.""

142
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:43,840
Unquote. Close paragraph.

143
00:11:43,915 --> 00:11:46,577
Close job.
Close bank account.

144
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,320
But how can we possibly get inside
the Lord estate, let alone the house?

145
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,755
We´re not gonna do it,
doggone it!

146
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:55,759
lt´s degrading!
lt´s undignified!

147
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:58,159
So is an empty stomach.
How do we get in?

148
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,196
Ask the gentleman to come in.

149
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,340
-l understand we understand each other.
-Quite.

150
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,351
This gentleman has been employed
in our Buenos Aires office.

151
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:23,717
Fortunately, he came up
yesterday on the clipper...

152
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:26,518
and l believe he can
help us with our problem.

153
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:27,853
How?

154
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:31,292
Tracy Lord´s brother Junius is
in the American embassy down there...

155
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:34,024
and he´s an old friend
of this gentleman´s.

156
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:37,397
He´ll introduce you to the Lords
as intimate friends of Junius.

157
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,129
Dear old Junius.

158
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:42,104
This Tracy Lord,
does she know you?

159
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:44,539
You might say Miss Lord and l
grew up together.

160
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:47,840
You might also say
you were her first husband.

161
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:49,174
Yes, you might.

162
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:51,772
Holy mackerel.
What goes on here?

163
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:55,717
l remember your honeymoon very well,
you and she on a little sailboat.

164
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:59,086
-The True Love, wasn´t it?
-How did you know?

165
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:02,092
l was the only photographer
whose camera you didn´t smash.

166
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,618
You were terribly nice about it.
You threw it in the ocean.

167
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,597
One of those, huh?

168
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:10,759
Yes, l had the strange idea
our honeymoon was our own business.

169
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:15,295
lncidentally, he paid for the cameras.
l got a nice letter of apology too.

170
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,034
Always the gentleman, huh?

171
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:18,973
Except on occasion.

172
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:20,977
Now, what are the plans?

173
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:23,741
The wedding´s Saturday.
Today is Thursday.

174
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:26,249
They should spend tomorrow night
as guests of the Lords.

175
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:28,308
There´s somethin´ screwy here.

176
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:32,482
lf you´ve resigned, why are you
doin´ all this unless you--

177
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:37,524
You wanna get even
with your ex-bride, huh?

178
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:42,533
l´ll have a car pick them up
at noon tomorrow in north Philadelphia.

179
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:50,737
Mike, there´s spit in your eye.
lt shows.

180
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:10,717
Maybe they´d rather we go around
to the servants´ entrance.

181
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:13,059
Maybe this is
the servants´ entrance.

182
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:24,871
-Good morning, Edward.
-Why, Mr. Haven!

183
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:28,378
ls Mrs. Haven--l mean,
Miss Tracy or her mother in?

184
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:32,246
They may be at the swimming pool, sir.
Shall l announce you?

185
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:35,012
No. l´ll go around myself
and surprise them.

186
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:37,554
lt will indeed
be a surprise, sir.

187
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:40,420
These are friends of Mr. Junius´s.
Have them wait in the south parlor.

188
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:42,083
Certainly, Mr. Haven.

189
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:53,261
Excuse me, sir.

190
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,766
The south parlor?

191
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:01,937
Miss lmbrie, the south parlor.

192
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:06,681
The queen will have bread and honey
at the usual time.

193
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,817
Seems a little cold
for the south parlor.

194
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:21,292
l´d rather expected to find
pickaninnies and banjos.

195
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:28,829
What´s this room?
l forgot my compass.

196
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:36,340
This would be south-southwest
parlor by living room.

197
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:39,076
Knickknacks, gimcracks,
signed photographs.

198
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,381
You´d have to be as rich as the Lords
to live in a dump like this.

199
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:45,388
-l wouldn´t live in it if they paid me.
-They won´t.

200
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,762
Looks like they run
a hockshop on the side.

201
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:23,860
Just lookin´ around.

202
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:49,482
l´ll want your fingerprints for this.

203
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,358
Hey, what´s this--
What´s this guy Haven up to?

204
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:58,156
C.K. Dexter Haven.

205
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:01,995
What kind of a name is that?
C.K. Dexter Haven.

206
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:04,660
Macaulay Connor´s
no homespun tag, my pet.

207
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:07,363
Yeah, you just try
callin´ me Macaulay.

208
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:09,201
l knew a plain Joe Smith once.

209
00:17:09,273 --> 00:17:13,039
He was only a clerk in a hardware store,
but he was an absolute rat.

210
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:17,910
C.K. Dexter Haven.

211
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:22,112
He plays polo, he designs
sailboats, ""class"" boats.

212
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,814
-Very upper class.
-Don´t despair.

213
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:27,255
He´s out. Kittredge,
man of the people, is in.

214
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:30,385
Quite a comer too, l understand.
Political timber.

215
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:32,554
Poor guy. l wonder
how he fell for it.

216
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,997
Uh-oh, Liz. What did l tell you?
How do you like this?

217
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:39,833
""Living room, sitting room,
terrace, pool, stables.""

218
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:42,839
That´s so they can talk to the horses
without having them in the house.

219
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:45,341
Don´t, Mike!

220
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:52,948
Yes?

221
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:54,746
This is the bridal suite.

222
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:57,447
Send up some caviar sandwiches
and a bottle of beer.

223
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:59,284
What? Who is this?

224
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:02,087
This is the voice of doom calling.

225
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,993
Your days are numbered,
to the seventh son of the seventh son!

226
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,067
-Hello? Hello?
-What´s the matter?

227
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,639
One of the servants
has been at the sherry again.

228
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:21,502
-Dexter, you´ve come back!
-Ah, Dinah, my dream girl!

229
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:23,513
What in the name of--

230
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:28,578
No, it can´t be. He went to
South America for two years.

231
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:31,315
Edward said they were
at the swimming pool.

232
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:32,822
They seem to be here.

233
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:39,886
Dexter, don´t you know
that tomorrow is the wedding?

234
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:41,989
Oh, that´s right.
So it is.

235
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,599
You can go right back
where you came from!

236
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:49,105
Can´t. Dinah says it´s
awful here without me.

237
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:51,266
Hello, you sweet thing.

238
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:53,537
Red, you look in the pink.

239
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:57,246
You don´t think l´d miss
your wedding, do you?

240
00:18:57,314 --> 00:19:00,715
-Dexter, you wouldn´t.
-l´m not so sure he wouldn´t.

241
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:03,754
No, Mother Lord, l wouldn´t.
l assure you l wouldn´t.

242
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:06,415
-Tell us all about Junius.
-Stay ´til lunch.

243
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,517
Don´t open your house. Stay here.
We´re having no guests over the wedding.

244
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:14,857
-How about the groom?
-He´s staying at the gatehouse.

245
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:16,263
Oh, that´s good.

246
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,563
-Junius is fine.
-He should be here.

247
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:21,298
He´s heartbroken. l suggested
representing him as best man--

248
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:25,172
l´m afraid that George might prefer
to have his best man sober.

249
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:26,903
l wish you´d represent George.

250
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:30,378
That´s my loyal little girl.
You´ll like the people Junius did send.

251
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:33,474
You haven´t switched from liquor
to dope, by any chance?

252
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:35,849
-You see?
-The people Junius did send?

253
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,821
You don´t know a Macaulay Connor
or Elizabeth lmbrie, do you?

254
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:41,483
-We can finish these later.
-l´d better introduce you.

255
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:45,461
Call me for--
lntroduce me to whom?

256
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:48,498
To Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor,
to tell them which rooms they´d have.

257
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:52,400
Mr. Connor is asking if he should wear
a black or white tie to tonight´s party.

258
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,031
-Rooms?
-l´d better start from the beginning.

259
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,769
Sit down, dear.
They´re great friends of Junius´s.

260
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:02,040
And they expect to stay here?
l think that´s very queer.

261
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,946
l think it´s queerer than that.
l think it´s paranoiac.

262
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:08,451
You see, it was Junius´s idea.
They´ve been very kind to him, and--

263
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,386
You´re lying, Dexter.
l can always tell.

264
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:13,389
-Can you, Red?
-They´re Junius´s friends.

265
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:15,925
You went to work after
the divorce, didn´t you?

266
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:18,791
Yes, except for a brief interlude
in some alcoholic sanitariums.

267
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:21,058
You took a job
in South America. Who for?

268
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,828
-A magazine.
-lt wasn´t Spy magazine?

269
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:25,630
You are a mass of intuition.

270
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:28,831
l don´t suppose that Junius´s
friends are photographers?

271
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:31,397
-l thought you were low, but l never--
-What are you going to do?

272
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:34,410
-After l´ve telephoned Junius--
-Wait, Red.

273
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:36,469
Don´t telephone Junius.
l´ll confess.

274
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:44,448
No. You´re slipping, Red.

275
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:48,481
l used to be afraid of that look,
the withering glance of the goddess.

276
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,119
l didn´t think that alcohol would--
Oh, shut up.

277
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:55,195
Dinah, stay here.

278
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:57,826
Please, Mother.
Maybe he´s going to sock her.

279
00:20:57,902 --> 00:21:01,861
Don´t say ""sock,"" darling.
""Strike"" is quite an ugly enough word.

280
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:06,008
Who do they think they are,
barging in on peaceful people?

281
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:09,807
-They´ll think you don´t want them.
-l want them out, and you too!

282
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,509
Yes, your majesty. But first could l
interest you in some small blackmail?

283
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:18,785
lt´s an article, complete with
snapshots, details and insinuations...

284
00:21:18,856 --> 00:21:21,290
and it´s ready for
publication in Spy...

285
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,826
and it´s about your father
and that dancer in New York.

286
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:25,862
About Father and Tina Mara?

287
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,262
Quiet. Dinah.

288
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:31,665
But they can´t,
even if it´s true.

289
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,768
-Where do you get these?
-From Sidney Kidd, editor and publisher.

290
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,469
-He´s got to be stopped.
-He is, temporarily.

291
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:42,979
That is, if you´ll allow those two
to turn in the story on your wedding.

292
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:46,073
And when Kidd says a story,
he means a story.

293
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,913
-l´m gonna be sick.
-Yes, dear.

294
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:50,715
""An lntimate Day
With a Society Bride.""

295
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,221
l am sick.

296
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,283
lt´s tough, but that´s
the way it seems to be.

297
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,260
So l´m to be examined, undressed
and generally humiliated...

298
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:00,297
at 15 cents a copy.

299
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:03,390
And you, you--
You´re loving it.

300
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,991
Am l, Red?

301
00:22:10,774 --> 00:22:12,207
Mother, we´re hooked.

302
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:14,676
-Are they really reporters?
-Not even friends of Junius´s?

303
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:17,373
They aren´t anybody´s friends,
but we´re to pretend they are.

304
00:22:17,448 --> 00:22:18,938
-But why?
-Don´t ask me.

305
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:21,576
There´s a good reason,
and it´s my wedding, so please!

306
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:24,246
l´ll bet it´s on account
of Father and that dancer.

307
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:26,812
-Dinah, what do you know?
-l listen around.

308
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:29,416
ls there no such thing
as privacy anymore?

309
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:31,961
Only in bed, Mother,
and not always there.

310
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:34,293
Watching every little mannerism...

311
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:37,027
jotting down notes on how we sit,
stand, talk, eat and move!

312
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:40,969
-Will they do that?
-All in that horrible, snide English.

313
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,201
lf we have to submit to it
to save Father´s face--

314
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,334
which, incidentally,
doesn´t deserve it--

315
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,743
l´ll give them a picture of home life
that´ll stand their hair on end!

316
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:54,778
Tracy, we must just be ourselves,
very much ourselves.

317
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:57,650
But you want us to create
a good impression, don´t you?

318
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:00,053
They don´t know that we know
what they´re here for?

319
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,490
No. That was understood.
The girl´s quite nice.

320
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,891
He writes short stories.
Very down to earth.

321
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:07,863
-They´ll love us.
-Oh, dear, you´d both better dress.

322
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:11,993
And both of you, promise to behave
like ladies in front of these creatures.

323
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:15,527
We´ll do our best, Mrs. Lord.
l don´t know how good that is.

324
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,509
Dexter, how perfectly dreadful.

325
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,016
What´ll they say about Seth not being
here for his own daughter´s wedding?

326
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:31,320
l know, dear.

327
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:38,651
You´d better go and tell them how
terribly happy we are to have them.

328
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:41,254
That´s the old Quaker spirit,
Mother Lord.

329
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:42,924
Keep swinging.

330
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,600
Oh. l thought it was that butler.

331
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:54,769
The family will be down
to welcome you.

332
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:56,836
-What with?
-With open arms.

333
00:23:56,914 --> 00:23:59,576
They´re terribly happy to have
any friends of Junius´s here.

334
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,743
-Do they know about us?
-Why should they?

335
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:06,153
Look, Haven, our research department
didn´t give us much data.

336
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:10,250
This fiancé of this girl,
George Kittredge, age 32?

337
00:24:10,327 --> 00:24:12,488
-You know him very well?
-Well enough.

338
00:24:12,563 --> 00:24:16,863
""General manager of Quaker State Coal,
company owned by Seth Lord.""

339
00:24:16,934 --> 00:24:19,664
-That´s the girl´s father, huh?
-What a coincidence.

340
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:21,500
How´d he meet her?

341
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:24,006
Heaven brought them together,
l imagine.

342
00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:27,109
""Seth Lord.

343
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:30,169
""See Banker´s Annual,
Directory of Directors.""

344
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:32,272
-ls there a library in town?
-Yes.

345
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,340
l suppose you wouldn´t
know where that is?

346
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:37,410
Well, roughly.
My grandfather built it.

347
00:24:40,457 --> 00:24:43,085
Now, about this girl...

348
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,924
""Tracy Samantha Lord.""

349
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:47,429
What about her?

350
00:24:47,498 --> 00:24:50,058
Well, what´s her
leading characteristic?

351
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:53,194
She has a horror of men
who wear their hats in the house.

352
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:57,832
Leading characteristics
to be filled in later.

353
00:24:57,908 --> 00:25:00,274
l can fill them in right now.

354
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:04,144
The young, rich, rapacious
American female.

355
00:25:04,214 --> 00:25:06,148
No other country
where she exists.

356
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:08,810
And would l change places
with Tracy Samantha Lord...

357
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:11,411
for all her wealth and beauty?

358
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:13,854
Oh, boy, just ask me.

359
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,551
Well, tell four footmen to call me
in time for lunch, will you?

360
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:28,833
How do you do?

361
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:32,498
Friends of my brother Junius,
are you not?

362
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:33,873
l am Dinah Lord.

363
00:25:33,944 --> 00:25:36,242
My real name is Diana,
but my sister changed it.

364
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:38,508
l´m Elizabeth lmbrie.
This is Macaulay Connor.

365
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:42,780
Enchantée de vous voir!
Enchantée de faire votre connaissance!

366
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:44,821
l spoke French
before l spoke English.

367
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:48,119
My early childhood was spent in Paris
where my father worked in a bank:

368
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:49,921
-The House of Morgan.
-Really?

369
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:52,086
C´est vrai absolument!

370
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:55,859
Can you play the piano?
l can, and sing at the same time!

371
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:57,366
Listen.

372
00:26:06,677 --> 00:26:09,475
Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia

373
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:12,606
Oh, Lydia
the tattooed lady

374
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:15,516
She has eyes
that folks adore so

375
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:18,749
And a torso even more so

376
00:26:18,822 --> 00:26:21,052
What is this?

377
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,558
ldiot, probably.

378
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,321
The queen of tattoos

379
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:27,557
On her back
is the battle of Waterloo

380
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:30,293
Beside it the wreck
of the Hesperus too

381
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:34,133
And proudly above
waves the red, white

382
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:36,069
And blue

383
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,871
You can learn a lot from Lydia

384
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:43,037
Ah, petite soeur,
tu es un véritable petit Chopin!

385
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:44,705
-Tu trouves?
-Mais certainement.

386
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:47,807
Mais qu´est-ce qu´il y a?
Voyons, tu es pâle.

387
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:51,651
Montre-moi ta langue. J´esp?re bien
que ce n´est pas le smallpox.

388
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:53,383
-Le smallpox?
-Mais oui.

389
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:55,391
Va dire á maman de se dépìcher!

390
00:27:00,464 --> 00:27:03,194
Oh. How do you do?

391
00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:06,666
l´m Tracy Lord.

392
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:09,638
lt´s so nice having you here.
How did you leave Junius?

393
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:12,004
We left Junius fine.
That little sister of yours--

394
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:14,202
lsn´t she a dear?
So talented.

395
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:17,839
-Junius is such a lamb, isn´t he?
-Yes, isn´t he?

396
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:22,284
lt´s a pity none of the male members
of the family are going to be here.

397
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:25,446
-Where´s your father?
-Darling Papa.

398
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:28,218
-l do hope you´ll stay for my wedding.
-We´d like to very much.

399
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:31,352
-That was our idea.
-l´m so glad that it occurred to you.

400
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:33,988
The house is in rather
a mess, of course.

401
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:38,023
We´ll all have to huddle here
and overflow onto the porch.

402
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:43,699
-l hope your rooms are comfortable.
-Your father sick?

403
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:48,611
-What a cunning little camera.
-l´m an awful nuisance with it.

404
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:51,273
But you couldn´t be.
l hope you´ll take loads.

405
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:54,146
Dear Papa and Mama aren´t
allowing any reporters in.

406
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:57,915
That is, except for little Mr. Grace,
who does the social news.

407
00:27:57,988 --> 00:28:00,718
Can you imagine a grown-up man
having to sink so low?

408
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,316
lt does seem kind of bad.

409
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:07,295
You´re a kind of writer...

410
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:09,958
-aren´t you, Mr. Connor?
-Sort of.

411
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:11,500
-A book?
-Yes.

412
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:13,832
Under what name do you publish?

413
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:16,771
My own. Macaulay Connor.

414
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:20,543
What´s the Macaulay for?

415
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:22,909
Well, my father
taught English history.

416
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,039
l´m ""Mike"" to my friends.

417
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:27,913
Of whom you have many, l´m sure.

418
00:28:27,985 --> 00:28:30,510
English history,
it´s always fascinated me:

419
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:33,181
Cromwell, Robin Hood,
Jack the Ripper.

420
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:35,987
Where did he teach?
l mean, your father.

421
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,527
ln a little high school
in South Bend, lndiana.

422
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,062
South Bend.

423
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,530
lt sounds like dancing,
doesn´t it?

424
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,124
You must have had a most
happy childhood there.

425
00:28:45,202 --> 00:28:47,227
-Yeah, it was terrific.
-l´m so glad.

426
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,239
-l didn´t mean it that way.
-l´m so sorry. Why?

427
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:53,276
Well, lack of wherewithal,
l guess.

428
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:56,676
But that doesn´t always cause
unhappiness, does it?

429
00:28:56,747 --> 00:28:58,408
Not if you´re
the right kind of man.

430
00:28:58,482 --> 00:29:02,043
George Kittredge, my fiancé,
never had anything either, and he--

431
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,609
Are either of you married?

432
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,624
You mean you were,
but now you´re divorced.

433
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:11,525
-The fact is--
-Surely you´re not ashamed of it.

434
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:13,961
-Of course l´m not.
-What?

435
00:29:14,031 --> 00:29:17,023
lt was years ago.
l was only a kid in Duluth.

436
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,193
Good heavens, Liz.
You never told me.

437
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:22,170
-You never asked me.
-l know, but you--

438
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,608
Joe Smith, hardware.

439
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:30,146
You´re the darnedest girl, Liz.

440
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:31,646
l think l´m sweet.

441
00:29:33,884 --> 00:29:37,047
Duluth must be a lovely spot.
lt´s west of here, isn´t it?

442
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,918
Sort of, but occasionally
we get the breezes--

443
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,424
And this is your first visit
in Philadelphia.

444
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:45,256
lt´s a quaint old place,
don´t you think? Filled with relics.

445
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:47,320
And how old are you, Mr. Connor?

446
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:48,523
Thirty.

447
00:29:48,598 --> 00:29:50,532
One book isn´t much
for a man of 30.

448
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,999
l don´t mean to criticize.

449
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:54,469
You probably have other interests
outside your work.

450
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:56,005
None.

451
00:29:56,073 --> 00:29:57,631
l mean us.

452
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:00,207
How sweet.

453
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,768
Are you going together?

454
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:07,814
-l beg your pardon?
-That is an odd question.

455
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:11,251
l don´t see why.
l think it´s very interesting.

456
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:14,717
Miss lmbrie, don´t you agree...

457
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:17,487
that if a man says he loves a girl,
he ought to marry her?

458
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:18,926
Can she be human?

459
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:21,623
Please, Mr. Connor.
l asked Miss lmbrie a question.

460
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:23,256
Well, that depends. l--

461
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,925
l´ll see what´s keeping Mama.

462
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,445
Who´s doing the interviewing here?

463
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:41,676
-You don´t suppose she caught on?
-No, she was born that way.

464
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:44,118
-Don´t let her throw ya.
-Do you want to take over?

465
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:47,384
-l wanna go home.
-Ah, here you are.

466
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:49,857
How do you do?
We´re so happy to have you.

467
00:30:49,926 --> 00:30:53,521
Forgive me for not coming in sooner,
but things are in such a state.

468
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:55,030
My little girl.

469
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:57,828
She´s going to leave me.

470
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:01,894
Aren´t you pretty, my dear.
But then Junius´s friends always are.

471
00:31:01,972 --> 00:31:04,372
Look at the way
she wears her hair, Tracy.

472
00:31:04,441 --> 00:31:07,069
-lsn´t it pretty?
-Mighty fine.

473
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:11,447
Shall we have sherry on the porch?

474
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:21,116
-This is my youngest daughter, Diana.
-l think we´ve met.

475
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:24,285
l wish my husband could be here.
We expect him presently.

476
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:28,127
He´s detained in New York on business
for that lovely dancer, Tina Mara.

477
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:30,462
-Do you know her work?
-Not professionally.

478
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:32,525
So talented,
and such a lovely person...

479
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:35,196
but like so many artists,
no business head.

480
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,569
None whatever.

481
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,575
l have some lovely presents,
don´t you think so, Mr. Connor?

482
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,117
Hello, everybody.

483
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:55,957
-l hope l´m not late.
-You´re never late, George.

484
00:31:56,026 --> 00:32:01,259
We have a lovely surprise. Junius has
sent these people as a wedding present.

485
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:04,095
Mr. Kittredge,
this is Miss--l´m so sorry.

486
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,328
-lmbrie.
-Any friend of Junius´s is my friend.

487
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:08,337
And, uh, Mr. Morrow?

488
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,270
-l didn´t get the name.
-Connor.

489
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,535
Macauley Connor.

490
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:13,598
He´s a writer.

491
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:15,042
Don´t apologize, Mrs. Lord.

492
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:17,477
No apology necessary.
l have great respect for writers.

493
00:32:17,547 --> 00:32:19,572
Well, thank you.
Any kind word is--

494
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:22,117
-How are you?
-Much better now that you´re here.

495
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:24,415
Oh, l guess this
must be love, huh?

496
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:27,821
-Your guess is correct.
-l´m just his faithful old dog Tray.

497
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:30,291
-Give me your paw.
-You´ve got it.

498
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:32,784
How sweet.

499
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,855
Say, l´d like to see
one of those, Miss lmbrie.

500
00:32:35,932 --> 00:32:37,160
You will.

501
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:38,826
Shall we have some sherry?

502
00:32:38,902 --> 00:32:42,167
l suppose Junius has told you
all about our happy little family.

503
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:44,799
-Papa!
-What?

504
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,869
Dear Papa.

505
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:53,749
You angel to get here
in time for lunch!

506
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:56,081
-lsn´t he, Mama?
-lndeed he is, but--

507
00:32:56,152 --> 00:32:58,586
Father, these are our friends,
Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor.

508
00:32:58,655 --> 00:33:02,716
-How are you, Mr. Lord?
-Oh, just fine, thank you.

509
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,726
-How are you?
-How do you do?

510
00:33:04,794 --> 00:33:06,091
How do you do?

511
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:07,561
Howdy, Pops.

512
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:09,223
Oh, dear Dinah.

513
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:13,095
-Father, here´s George.
-How are you, Kittredge?

514
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:14,500
Margaret, my sweet.

515
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:17,665
-Another place for luncheon, Edward.
-Very good, madam.

516
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:21,475
Well--here l am...

517
00:33:21,545 --> 00:33:23,479
in the bosom of my--

518
00:33:23,547 --> 00:33:25,811
-Hello, friends and enemies.
-Young man!

519
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,213
-Remove yourself.
-How are you, sir?

520
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:31,618
l don´t know. Get along.

521
00:33:31,688 --> 00:33:33,622
Darling, l´ve changed my mind.
l will stay for lunch.

522
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,317
Another place, Edward.

523
00:33:35,392 --> 00:33:37,758
-Hello, Kittredge.
-How are you, Haven?

524
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,454
Just Damon and Pythias.

525
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:41,827
No, Grant and Lee.

526
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:51,573
You don´t look as well as when
l last saw you, Kittredge.

527
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:54,576
Oh, you poor fellow.
l know just how you feel.

528
00:33:55,812 --> 00:33:58,280
-How´s it coming?
-Beautifully, Dexter.

529
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:02,045
We´re so indebted to you
for these lovely people.

530
00:34:02,118 --> 00:34:04,586
lt´s almost impossible
to repay that debt.

531
00:34:04,654 --> 00:34:06,588
But you´ll manage, eh, Red?

532
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:11,488
-They grew up together, you know.
-How nice.

533
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:13,586
You don´t look old enough
to get married...

534
00:34:13,663 --> 00:34:15,722
not even the first time,
but then you never did.

535
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:18,666
She needs trouble to mature her,
Kittredge. Give her lots of it.

536
00:34:18,735 --> 00:34:20,896
l´m afraid she can´t
count on me for that.

537
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:22,836
No? That´s too bad.

538
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:25,670
For your own sake, Red,
you should have stuck to me longer.

539
00:34:25,742 --> 00:34:28,973
l thought it was for life, but the nice
judge gave me a full pardon.

540
00:34:29,045 --> 00:34:32,208
Ah, that´s the old redhead.
No bitterness, no recrimination.

541
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:34,477
Just a good swift left to the jaw.

542
00:34:38,455 --> 00:34:40,582
They grew up together.

543
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:44,560
Luncheon is served, madam.

544
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:47,791
Oh, thank you, Edward. Come sit.
We have so much to talk about.

545
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:52,597
l don´t suppose a man ever had
a better or finer family.

546
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:54,762
l often wake up in the night
and say to myself...

547
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,274
""Seth, you lucky dog,
what have you done to deserve it all?""

548
00:34:58,341 --> 00:34:59,831
And what have you?

549
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:06,079
Oh, thank you.

550
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:12,080
Oh, how stupid of me!

551
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:15,821
Oh, dear! How awful!

552
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:17,826
l had a feeling
that would happen.

553
00:35:17,894 --> 00:35:21,489
Your camera.
l´m so, so sorry.

554
00:35:21,564 --> 00:35:23,054
l´m sure you are.

555
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:30,705
What is it?

556
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:31,934
Your father.

557
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:35,339
Uncle Willie!

558
00:35:38,148 --> 00:35:41,276
-Uncle Willie, how nice.
-l beg your pardon.

559
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:44,582
Please go on into lunch, everyone.
l want a word with Uncle Willie.

560
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:47,623
-Another place, Edward.
-Yes, madam.

561
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,193
l´m afraid l don´t understand.

562
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:58,132
You never have, but you
came anyway, didn´t you?

563
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:02,797
Oh. Still Justice with her
shining sword, eh, daughter?

564
00:36:02,872 --> 00:36:05,841
-Who´s on the spot?
-We are, thanks to you...

565
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,342
Uncle Willie.

566
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,513
How long will you be researching?

567
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:18,884
Not long if l can find the right books--
his family history and stuff like that.

568
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:21,150
There´s a cousin Joanna
that´s definitely crazy.

569
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:22,521
-Who told you?
-Dinah.

570
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:25,186
-Dinah should know.
-Come across the street when you finish.

571
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:27,024
-Miss Hobson´s establishment.
-Okay.

572
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:56,357
What does thee wish?

573
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:58,394
l´m looking for some local b--

574
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:03,933
-What´d you say?
-What does thee wish?

575
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:08,966
Um, local biography or history.

576
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:11,802
lf thee will, consult with
my colleague in there.

577
00:37:17,247 --> 00:37:19,340
Dost thou have a washroom?

578
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:22,546
Thank thee.

579
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,441
l know this is a public library,
but l wou--

580
00:37:46,509 --> 00:37:48,568
-Hello.
-Hello.

581
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:53,679
Couldn´t you afford
to buy my book?

582
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,445
The bookstore didn´t have one.

583
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:57,645
Are you sure you´re doing
the right thing?

584
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,416
You know what happens to girls like you
when they read books like mine.

585
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,890
They begin to think.
That´s bad.

586
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:05,086
These stories are beautiful.

587
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:07,186
Why, Connor,
they´re almost poetry.

588
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:11,094
Don´t kid yourself. They are.

589
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:13,635
l can´t make you out at all now.

590
00:38:13,703 --> 00:38:16,831
Really?
l thought l was easy.

591
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:20,137
So did l, but you´re not.

592
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:25,372
You talk so big and tough,
and then you write like this.

593
00:38:26,482 --> 00:38:27,949
Which is which?

594
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,381
Both, l guess.

595
00:38:33,356 --> 00:38:37,486
No, l believe you put the toughness on
to save your skin.

596
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:40,829
You think so?

597
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:42,831
l know a little about that.

598
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,032
-Do you?
-Quite a lot.

599
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:52,007
Let´s get out of here.

600
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:04,076
This book was just such
a complete surprise to me.

601
00:39:04,153 --> 00:39:06,986
l--let´s walk, shall we?
lt´ll be much more fun.

602
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:09,524
Take this. Tell Mr. Kittredge
we´ll meet him at the pool.

603
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:11,025
Yes, Miss Tracy.

604
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:17,994
The story called, ""With The Rich
and Mighty,"" l think l liked it best.

605
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:20,968
l got it from
a Spanish peasant´s proverb.

606
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:23,665
""With the rich and mighty,
always a little patience.""

607
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,037
l like that.

608
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:30,337
What´s the matter?
A little too rough?

609
00:39:30,413 --> 00:39:31,846
A little...

610
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:33,678
but l´m used to it.

611
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:37,716
Tell me something, will you?

612
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:41,814
When you can do a thing like that book,
how can you possibly do anything else?

613
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:46,157
You may not believe this, but there
are people that must earn their living.

614
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:48,561
Of course, but people
buy books, don´t they?

615
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:50,565
Not as long as there´s
a library around.

616
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:54,995
That book of mine represents
two solid years´ work...

617
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:58,768
and it netted Connor
something under $600.

618
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:02,277
-But that shouldn´t be.
-Unhappily it is.

619
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:04,813
This is beautiful country around here.
What is it all, anyway?

620
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:08,373
Part of our place.
What about your Miss lmbrie?

621
00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:10,612
Well, Miss lmbrie´s
in somewhat the same fix.

622
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:12,985
She´s a born painter and might be
a very important one...

623
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,787
but Miss lmbrie must eat, and she also
prefers a roof over her head...

624
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:19,885
to being constantly out
in the rain and snow.

625
00:40:19,963 --> 00:40:21,396
Food and a roof.

626
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:26,661
You´ve really got something here.

627
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:28,363
-Where?
-All this.

628
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:32,073
Oh. Come on.
The dressing rooms are over here.

629
00:40:34,477 --> 00:40:36,502
l think you´ll find
everything you need.

630
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:42,782
Use any old one, but l think you´ll find
most of the junk in there.

631
00:40:42,852 --> 00:40:44,911
-Yell if you need anything.
-Okay.

632
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:03,930
l have an idea.

633
00:41:05,341 --> 00:41:08,071
l have the most wonderful
little house in Uniondale.

634
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:12,675
lt´s up on a hill with a view
that would knock you silly.

635
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,842
l´m never there except
in the hunting season...

636
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:18,080
and not much then,
and l´d be so happy to know...

637
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:20,714
that it was of some real use
to someone.

638
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,751
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

639
00:41:26,629 --> 00:41:29,757
There´s a brook and a small lake--

640
00:41:29,832 --> 00:41:31,595
no size, really--

641
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,659
and a patch of woods,
and in any kind of weather...

642
00:41:34,737 --> 00:41:37,001
it´s the most wonderful--

643
00:41:37,073 --> 00:41:41,066
Well, anyhow, l´m so delighted
that l can offer it to you.

644
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,941
Well, it´s terribly nice of you,
but, uh--

645
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:49,044
Heck, that´s Dexter.

646
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:53,885
Look, if he comes here,
stand by, will you?

647
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:56,447
-l don´t want to be alone with him.
-Certainly, if you like.

648
00:41:56,526 --> 00:41:59,393
lsn´t it lucky that l happened
to think about that house?

649
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:02,454
And don´t think l´d come trooping in
every minute, because l wouldn´t.

650
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:05,330
l´d never come
except when expressly asked to.

651
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:09,098
-Well, it isn´t that.
-What is it?

652
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:11,106
Well, you see,
the idea of artists...

653
00:42:11,174 --> 00:42:15,167
depending upon a patron lady bountiful
has more or less gone out.

654
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:19,539
Oh. l see.

655
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,484
That wasn´t especially kind
of you, Mr. Connor.

656
00:42:25,555 --> 00:42:27,955
l´m sorry to have seemed patronizing.

657
00:42:28,024 --> 00:42:30,185
-Now, look, l didn´t mean--
-Please don´t bother.

658
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:39,493
-Hello.
-Hello. Fancy seeing you here.

659
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:41,264
Orange juice? Certainly.

660
00:42:41,337 --> 00:42:44,465
Don´t tell me you´ve forsaken
your beloved whiskey and whiskeys.

661
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,735
No, l´ve just changed their color.

662
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:50,301
l´m going for the pale pastel shades.
They´re more becoming to me.

663
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:52,370
How about you, Mr. Connor?
You drink, don´t you?

664
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:54,439
-Alcohol, l mean.
-A little.

665
00:42:54,517 --> 00:42:56,712
A little?
And you´re a writer?

666
00:42:56,786 --> 00:43:00,278
Tsk, tsk, tsk. l thought all writers
drank to excess and beat their wives.

667
00:43:00,356 --> 00:43:03,917
You know, at one time l think
l secretly wanted to be a writer.

668
00:43:05,628 --> 00:43:08,756
Dexter, would you mind
doing something for me?

669
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:10,822
-Anything. What?
-Get the heck out of here.

670
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,367
l couldn´t do that.

671
00:43:12,435 --> 00:43:14,403
That wouldn´t be fair to you.
You need me too much.

672
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,904
Would you tell me what
you´re hanging around for?

673
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:20,272
-No, please don´t go, Mr. Connor.
-No, please don´t go, Mr. Connor.

674
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:22,709
As a writer, this ought to be
right up your street.

675
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:24,245
Don´t miss a word.

676
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:28,948
l never saw you looking better, Red.
You´re getting that fine, tawny look.

677
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:32,749
Oh, we´re going to talk
about me, are we? Goody.

678
00:43:32,822 --> 00:43:36,155
lt´s astonishing what money can do
for people, don´t you agree, Mr. Connor?

679
00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:38,659
Not too much, you know.
Just more than enough.

680
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:41,929
Take Tracy, for example.

681
00:43:41,998 --> 00:43:44,262
There was never a blow that
hasn´t been softened for her.

682
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,268
Never a blow that won´t be softened.
lt´s even changed her shape.

683
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:51,898
-She was once a dumpy little thing.
-l´m not interested in myself now.

684
00:43:51,974 --> 00:43:55,000
Not interested in yourself?
You´re fascinated, Red.

685
00:43:55,077 --> 00:43:57,443
You´re far and away
your favorite person in the world.

686
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:59,504
-ln case you don´t know--
-Of course, Mr. Connor...

687
00:43:59,582 --> 00:44:01,641
she´s a girl
who´s generous to a fault.

688
00:44:01,717 --> 00:44:03,412
To a fault, Mr. Connor.

689
00:44:03,486 --> 00:44:05,613
Except to other people´s faults.

690
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:07,656
For instance, she never had
any understanding...

691
00:44:07,723 --> 00:44:09,281
of my deep and gorgeous thirst.

692
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:11,690
-That was your problem.
-Granted.

693
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:14,753
But you took on that problem
with me when you took me, Red.

694
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,889
You were no helpmate there.
You were a scold.

695
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:19,935
lt was disgusting.
lt made you so unattractive.

696
00:44:20,002 --> 00:44:23,199
A weakness, sure, and strength
is her religion, Mr. Connor.

697
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:25,968
She finds human imperfection
unforgivable.

698
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,474
When l discovered that
my relationship to her...

699
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:32,810
was supposed to be not that of a loving
husband and a good companion but--

700
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:36,308
-Oh, never mind.
-Say it.

701
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,189
But that of a kind of high priest
to a virgin goddess.

702
00:44:41,524 --> 00:44:44,322
Then my drinks grew deeper
and more frequent.

703
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:48,088
l never considered you as that
nor myself.

704
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:50,223
You did it without knowing it.

705
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:54,861
And the night that you got drunk on
champagne and climbed out on the roof...

706
00:44:54,937 --> 00:44:58,338
and stood there, naked,
with your arms out to the moon...

707
00:44:58,407 --> 00:44:59,897
wailing like a banshee.

708
00:45:01,477 --> 00:45:04,446
l never had the slightest recollection
of doing any such thing.

709
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:07,277
You drew a blank.
You wanted to.

710
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,341
Mr. Connor, what would you--oh.

711
00:45:10,786 --> 00:45:12,913
A nice story for Spy,
incidentally.

712
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:15,253
Yes. Too bad we can´t supply
photographs of you on the roof.

713
00:45:15,324 --> 00:45:17,849
Honestly, the fuss you made
over that silly, childish epis--

714
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:21,021
lt was enormously important
and most revealing.

715
00:45:21,097 --> 00:45:24,430
The moon is also a goddess,
chaste and virginal.

716
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,060
Stop using those foul words.

717
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:29,696
What are you trying
to make me out as?

718
00:45:29,772 --> 00:45:32,866
-What do you fancy yourself as?
-l don´t know that l fancy myself--

719
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:35,001
When l read you´re gonna marry
Kittredge l couldn´t believe it.

720
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:37,341
That´s why l´m here.
How could he even think of it?

721
00:45:37,413 --> 00:45:39,108
Because he´s everything you´re not.

722
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:42,207
He´s been poor, he´s had to work,
and he´s had to fight for everything...

723
00:45:42,285 --> 00:45:45,686
and l love him as l never
even began to love you.

724
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:49,191
Maybe so, but l doubt it.
lt´s just a swing from me...

725
00:45:49,258 --> 00:45:51,192
but it´s too violent a swing.

726
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,353
Kittredge is no great
tower of strength.

727
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:55,124
He´s just a tower.

728
00:45:55,197 --> 00:45:56,755
You hardly know him.

729
00:45:56,832 --> 00:45:58,800
To hardly know him
is to know him well.

730
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:02,304
Perhaps it offends my vanity to have
anyone who was even remotely my wife...

731
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:04,032
remarry so obviously beneath her.

732
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:09,875
How dare you, in this day and age,
use such an idiotic--

733
00:46:09,945 --> 00:46:13,108
l´m talking about the difference
in mind and spirit.

734
00:46:13,182 --> 00:46:15,946
You could marry Mac,
the night watchman. l´d cheer for you.

735
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:18,748
-Kittredge is not for you.
-You bet he´s for me.

736
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:21,085
He´s a great man and a good man.

737
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:23,853
Already he´s
of national importance.

738
00:46:23,926 --> 00:46:26,451
You sound like Spy magazine talking.

739
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:29,225
But whatever he is, toots,
you´ll have to stick.

740
00:46:29,298 --> 00:46:32,495
-He´ll give you no out as l did.
-l won´t require one.

741
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:39,104
l suppose you´d still be attractive
to any man of spirit, though.

742
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:42,167
There´s something engaging about it,
this ""goddess"" business...

743
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:45,736
something more challenging to the male
than the more obvious charms.

744
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:47,874
-Really?
-Really.

745
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,884
We´re very vain, you know.

746
00:46:49,952 --> 00:46:53,410
""This citadel can and shall be taken,
and l´m the boy to do it.""

747
00:46:54,824 --> 00:46:58,453
You seem quite contemptuous of me
all of a sudden.

748
00:46:59,628 --> 00:47:02,096
No, Red, not of you.

749
00:47:02,164 --> 00:47:03,461
Never of you.

750
00:47:07,002 --> 00:47:10,631
Red, you could be the finest woman
on this earth.

751
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:14,267
l´m contemptuous of something inside you
you either can´t help or won´t try to.

752
00:47:14,343 --> 00:47:16,174
Your so-called ""strength""...

753
00:47:16,245 --> 00:47:19,146
your prejudice against weakness,
your blank intolerance.

754
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:21,706
-ls that all?
-That´s the gist of it.

755
00:47:21,784 --> 00:47:25,720
Because you´ll never be a first-class
human being or a first-class woman...

756
00:47:25,788 --> 00:47:28,154
until you´ve learned to have
regard for human frailty.

757
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:32,560
lt´s a pity your own foot
can´t slip a little sometime...

758
00:47:32,628 --> 00:47:34,960
but your sense of inner divinity
wouldn´t allow that.

759
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,158
This goddess must
and shall remain intact.

760
00:47:40,403 --> 00:47:42,496
There are more of you
than people realize.

761
00:47:42,571 --> 00:47:45,563
A special class of the American female.
""The Married Maidens.""

762
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:47,575
So help me,
if you say another word--

763
00:47:47,643 --> 00:47:49,873
l´m through, Red.
For the moment l´ve had my say.

764
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:53,340
l suppose l should object
to this twosome.

765
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:55,350
That would be most objectionable.

766
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:00,521
Any time either of you
want my advice--

767
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:02,921
-We´ll give you a ring.
-Thanks. Do that, will you?

768
00:48:08,364 --> 00:48:10,332
So long, Red.

769
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:14,733
l left you a wedding present. Sorry l
hadn´t ribbon to tie it up with.

770
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:40,689
Aren´t you swimming?

771
00:48:40,763 --> 00:48:43,027
We haven´t time.
Uncle Willie wants us at 8:00.

772
00:48:46,402 --> 00:48:49,030
Look what your friend
considers a wedding present.

773
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,109
-Why, it´s a model of the True Love.
-The what?

774
00:48:55,244 --> 00:48:58,213
A boat he designed
and built, practically.

775
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,307
We sailed it down the coast of Maine
and back the summer we were married.

776
00:49:02,384 --> 00:49:03,749
My, she was yare!

777
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:05,286
""Yare""? What´s that mean?

778
00:49:05,354 --> 00:49:08,551
lt means, uh--
Oh, what does it mean?

779
00:49:09,658 --> 00:49:12,650
Easy to handle, quick to the helm.
Fast, bright.

780
00:49:13,896 --> 00:49:15,864
Everything a boat should be...

781
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:17,865
until she develops dry rot.

782
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:28,606
Oh, George, to get away.

783
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,941
Somehow to be useful
in the world.

784
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:32,878
Useful? You, Tracy?

785
00:49:32,948 --> 00:49:35,974
l´m gonna build you an ivory tower
with my own two hands.

786
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,746
Like fun you are.

787
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:41,619
You mean you´ve
been in one too long?

788
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:46,286
Well, l mean that
and a lot of things.

789
00:49:57,006 --> 00:49:59,406
You know, we´re gonna
represent something, Tracy...

790
00:49:59,475 --> 00:50:01,909
you and l and our home.

791
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:05,208
Something straight, sound and fine.

792
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:08,648
Then perhaps Mr. Haven will be
somewhat less condescending.

793
00:50:15,624 --> 00:50:17,751
You don´t really mind him, do you?

794
00:50:18,894 --> 00:50:20,862
l mean the fact of him?

795
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,864
""Fact of him""?
What do you mean?

796
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:24,991
l mean--
Well, you know.

797
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,535
That he ever was
my lord and master.

798
00:50:27,603 --> 00:50:29,036
That we ever were--

799
00:50:29,104 --> 00:50:31,299
l don´t believe
he ever was, Tracy.

800
00:50:31,373 --> 00:50:32,465
Not really.

801
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,977
l don´t believe that anyone ever was
or ever will be.

802
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:38,775
That´s the wonderful thing
about you, Tracy.

803
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:40,212
What? How?

804
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:44,685
You´re like some marvelous, distant,
well, queen, l guess.

805
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:48,416
You´re so cool and fine
and always so much your own.

806
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,789
There´s a kind of beautiful purity
about you, Tracy, like a statue.

807
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,794
-George--
-lt´s grand, Tracy.

808
00:50:53,862 --> 00:50:56,092
lt´s what everybody
feels about you.

809
00:50:56,165 --> 00:50:58,360
lt´s what l first
worshipped you for from afar.

810
00:50:58,434 --> 00:51:01,369
-George, listen.
-First, now and always.

811
00:51:03,038 --> 00:51:05,370
Only from a little nearer now,
eh, darling?

812
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:10,037
l--l don´t want to be worshipped.
l want to be loved.

813
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:13,206
Well, you´re that too, Tracy.
You´re that, all right.

814
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:16,149
l mean really loved.

815
00:51:16,218 --> 00:51:19,051
But that goes
without saying, Tracy.

816
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:23,353
No. No, now it´s you
who doesn´t see what l mean.

817
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:30,464
l´d better get dressed.
l hate to be late.

818
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:41,071
Oh, nothing. Run along.
l´ll be dressed when you get back.

819
00:52:23,285 --> 00:52:25,719
You´re Uncle Willie´s guest of honor.
You mustn´t be late.

820
00:52:25,788 --> 00:52:28,655
That fiancé of yours roared
out of here on two wheels.

821
00:52:28,724 --> 00:52:30,954
Does he, by any chance,
ever walk anywhere?

822
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:33,085
When he likes, l expect.

823
00:52:33,162 --> 00:52:36,393
l have a feeling he´ll take that ring
tomorrow and go through center with it.

824
00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:38,092
Seth, you idiot!

825
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:42,028
Very amusing, l´m sure.

826
00:52:42,104 --> 00:52:45,267
Almost as amusing as the sight of you
with your arm around Mother.

827
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:48,899
l find very unamusing...

828
00:52:48,977 --> 00:52:51,605
the stupid, undignified spectacle
we´re making of ourselves...

829
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,080
for the benefit
of those two newspaper people.

830
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:55,616
Whose fault is it?

831
00:52:55,684 --> 00:52:59,017
That´s not the point. They can publish
anything they like about me...

832
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:01,648
but l insist that we inform Connor
and the camera lady...

833
00:53:01,724 --> 00:53:04,124
that we´re all aware
of their purpose here.

834
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:06,457
All right.
l´ll tell them myself.

835
00:53:07,696 --> 00:53:12,099
lt´d look better coming from me
as the titular head of the family.

836
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:14,829
Of course, inasmuch as you´ve
let us in for it in the first place!

837
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:17,667
Keep that note out of your voice.
lt´s very unattractive.

838
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:22,268
Oh? How does your dancer friend talk,
or does she purr?

839
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:23,936
-Tracy!
-lt´s quite all right.

840
00:53:24,012 --> 00:53:27,209
Sweet and low, l suppose.
Dulcet. Very ladylike.

841
00:53:27,282 --> 00:53:30,217
You´ve got nerve to come back here in
your best head-of-the-family manner...

842
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:34,119
and make stands and strike attitudes
and criticize my fiancé...

843
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:36,248
and give orders
and mess things up generally.

844
00:53:36,325 --> 00:53:38,623
-Stop it instantly!
-l can´t help it! lt´s sickening!

845
00:53:38,694 --> 00:53:42,460
-As if he´d done nothing at all.
-Which happens to be the truth.

846
00:53:42,531 --> 00:53:45,466
Anyway, it´s not your affair.
lf it concerns anyone--

847
00:53:47,069 --> 00:53:49,663
Well, actually, l don´t know
who it concerns except your father.

848
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,800
That´s very wise of you, Margaret.

849
00:53:53,876 --> 00:53:57,039
What most wives fail to realize is that
their husbands´ philandering...

850
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:59,376
has nothing whatever
to do with them.

851
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:02,611
Oh? Then what has it to do with?

852
00:54:03,585 --> 00:54:06,713
A reluctance to grow old, l think.

853
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:10,020
l suppose the best mainstay a man
can have as he gets along in years...

854
00:54:10,092 --> 00:54:12,083
is a daughter.

855
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:14,095
The right kind of daughter.

856
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,755
How sweet.

857
00:54:15,831 --> 00:54:18,698
No, l´m talking seriously about
something l´ve thought over thoroughly.

858
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:20,064
l´ve had to.

859
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:22,296
A devoted young girl
gives a man the illusion...

860
00:54:22,371 --> 00:54:24,339
that youth is still his.

861
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:27,204
-Very important, l suppose.
-Oh, very, very.

862
00:54:27,276 --> 00:54:30,734
Because, without her, he might be
inclined to go in search of his youth.

863
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:34,442
That´s just as important to him
as it is to any woman.

864
00:54:34,516 --> 00:54:37,383
But with a girl of his own,
full of warmth for him...

865
00:54:37,452 --> 00:54:40,148
full of foolish, unquestioning,
uncritical affection--

866
00:54:40,222 --> 00:54:42,884
-None of which l´ve got.
-None.

867
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,324
You have a good mind,
a pretty face...

868
00:54:45,394 --> 00:54:47,658
a disciplined body that does
what you tell it.

869
00:54:47,729 --> 00:54:51,688
You have everything it takes to make
a lovely woman except the one essential.

870
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:54,258
An understanding heart.

871
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:57,066
Without that, you might as well
be made of bronze.

872
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:03,441
That´s an awful thing
to say to anyone.

873
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,548
Yes, it is indeed.

874
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:12,148
So l´m to blame
for Tina Mara, am l?

875
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:15,088
-To a certain extent, l expect you are.
-You coward!

876
00:55:16,658 --> 00:55:20,424
But better that than a prig
or a perennial spinster...

877
00:55:20,495 --> 00:55:22,292
however many marriages.

878
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:24,559
-Seth, that´s too much.
-l´m afraid it´s not enough.

879
00:55:24,633 --> 00:55:26,430
l´m afraid nothing is.

880
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:30,665
-What did you say l was?
-Do you want me to repeat it?

881
00:55:33,575 --> 00:55:35,509
A prig and a--

882
00:55:37,246 --> 00:55:40,704
You mean you think l think l´m some kind
of a goddess or something?

883
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:43,979
lf your ego
wants it that way, yes.

884
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:46,714
Also, you´ve been talking
like a jealous woman.

885
00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:54,819
What´s the matter with everyone
all at once, anyhow?

886
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:59,431
l´ve been asleep.
What time is it?

887
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:01,662
-After 7:00.
-Call my house.

888
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:03,830
Tell them l´m on my way.
You´d better come along too.

889
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:06,932
You´re the host tonight,
you know? Uncle Willie.

890
00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:09,671
That´s all over.
You´re yourself again. So am l.

891
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:12,373
-You´ve told them?
-l shall at the first opportunity.

892
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:16,547
My first party, and about time.

893
00:56:16,618 --> 00:56:18,552
-Can l have a cocktail?
-Certainly not!

894
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:22,021
-lt´s a dirty gyp.
-That dress hikes up a little behind.

895
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,786
-No, it´s me that does.
-You look adorable, Dinah.

896
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,124
Oh, thanks, Tracy.
Thanks ever so much.

897
00:56:27,195 --> 00:56:28,924
Tracy, you must dress.

898
00:56:28,997 --> 00:56:32,057
Let´s all have a last drink.
l´m sorry. l forgot. You never drink.

899
00:56:32,134 --> 00:56:33,931
-Prigs don´t.
-What´s that?

900
00:56:34,002 --> 00:56:36,334
-Nor spinsters.
-Again, please?

901
00:56:36,405 --> 00:56:38,498
Nor goddesses of any variety.

902
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:42,667
Not completely.
Just a borderline case.

903
00:56:42,744 --> 00:56:45,212
Miss lmbrie and l
have something on our minds.

904
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,441
Splendid.
Just the place for it. What?

905
00:56:47,516 --> 00:56:51,543
-We´d like to say something.
-l´m all ears and eyes.

906
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:56,015
You´re a vision of loveliness,
Miss lmbrie.

907
00:56:56,091 --> 00:56:58,025
Will you have a cocktail
or champagne?

908
00:56:58,093 --> 00:57:00,527
Oh, champagne.
l´ve never had enough.

909
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:02,222
You will, tonight.

910
00:57:05,934 --> 00:57:08,368
-l´d like to say--
-l have something to say first.

911
00:57:08,437 --> 00:57:11,929
-l am Seth Lord.
-No!

912
00:57:12,007 --> 00:57:15,408
-Then that makes you--
-Available.

913
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,502
And you are Miss lmbrie
of Spy magazine.

914
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:20,706
-Now you know.
-l was going to tell you--

915
00:57:20,782 --> 00:57:24,274
-As to the reasons--
-Not now. We ought to be early.

916
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:27,789
And who´ll go with me
in my little car?

917
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:31,952
Dinah and l. Seth, will you take
Miss lmbrie and Mr. O´Connor? Dinah?

918
00:57:33,128 --> 00:57:36,757
l can tell there´s something in the air,
because l´m being taken away.

919
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:41,758
Well, l´ll see you all later.

920
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:45,363
Don´t do that.
What´s the matter?

921
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,839
Nothing.

922
00:57:46,908 --> 00:57:48,341
Miss lmbrie?

923
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:53,712
You know, l felt exactly
as though l´d been pinched.

924
00:57:53,782 --> 00:57:55,716
Don´t you think you weren´t.

925
00:58:02,224 --> 00:58:03,816
You aren´t even dressed.

926
00:58:03,892 --> 00:58:06,292
Um, you go ahead.

927
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,694
l´ll, uh,
follow along with George.

928
00:58:09,765 --> 00:58:11,699
What´s the matter with Tracy?

929
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:14,501
You tell me, will you?

930
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:17,834
Darned if l know.
l´d like to.

931
00:58:17,906 --> 00:58:22,104
Well, Macaulay,
if you ever happen to find out--

932
00:58:22,177 --> 00:58:24,543
l´ll tell you. Sure.

933
00:58:24,613 --> 00:58:27,173
And remember, Mike:

934
00:58:27,249 --> 00:58:30,412
-""With the rich and mighty""--
-""Always a little patience""?

935
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:27,541
Do you know what time it is?

936
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:29,474
lt´s after 4:00.

937
00:59:29,544 --> 00:59:32,536
ln China it´s later than that.

938
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:35,082
ln China we´d be married by now.

939
00:59:36,852 --> 00:59:39,252
Or perhaps it´s only yesterday.

940
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:41,255
l´m going home after this dance.

941
00:59:41,323 --> 00:59:43,314
There was a Chinese poet
who was drowned...

942
00:59:43,391 --> 00:59:46,189
while trying to kiss
the moon in the river.

943
00:59:46,261 --> 00:59:49,128
-He was drunk.
-l´d say as much.

944
00:59:49,197 --> 00:59:50,858
But he wrote beautiful poetry.

945
01:00:06,414 --> 01:00:09,815
Macaulay Connor of South Bend
reporting for duty.

946
01:00:09,885 --> 01:00:11,978
l´m sorry, we´re going home
after this dance.

947
01:00:12,053 --> 01:00:15,079
You can´t do that to me,
not a friend of old Junius.

948
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:18,854
-l mean, not an old friend of Junius.
-l wish old Junius were here.

949
01:00:18,927 --> 01:00:20,895
Tracy, l´ll get your wraps.

950
01:00:20,962 --> 01:00:22,623
He´ll wrap me up.

951
01:00:22,697 --> 01:00:24,130
-Hello, you.
-Hello.

952
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:26,565
-You look fine.
-l feel fine.

953
01:00:26,635 --> 01:00:28,330
Good, good.

954
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:32,633
Oh, wait a minute.
What was l saying?

955
01:00:32,707 --> 01:00:35,676
Oh. Let´s have another drink,
or would Kittredge spank?

956
01:00:35,744 --> 01:00:39,271
-That´s not what you were saying.
-lt isn´t? All right.

957
01:00:39,347 --> 01:00:41,577
Not what l was saying.

958
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,311
Oh, oh, l know.

959
01:00:43,385 --> 01:00:46,877
Why do you wish your brother was here?
Does he like Kittredge?

960
01:00:46,955 --> 01:00:50,118
-Everybody likes Kittredge.
-Everybody likes Kittredge.

961
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:53,684
Everybody except
C.K. Dexter Haven, huh?

962
01:00:55,931 --> 01:00:59,059
-Come on. We´ll have some wine.
-Some wine.

963
01:01:01,903 --> 01:01:05,304
Mother, l thought you´d
gone home ages ago.

964
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:08,137
l should have, but l´ve been
having such a good time.

965
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:11,771
-Everybody should have a good time.
-Darling, what´s come over you?

966
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:14,440
Oh, it´s just that
a lot of things...

967
01:01:14,516 --> 01:01:17,314
l always thought were
terribly important...

968
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:21,788
l find now are--
and the other way around and--

969
01:01:21,856 --> 01:01:24,222
Oh, what the dickens.

970
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:27,090
Connor, you´re thirsty,
and the night is young.

971
01:01:28,263 --> 01:01:30,823
-Here we are, dear.
-We´re going to have one more drink--

972
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:34,232
-Not you, l´m afraid.
-Why should you be afraid?

973
01:01:34,302 --> 01:01:37,032
-You know wine never affects me.
-Look here--

974
01:01:37,105 --> 01:01:40,632
What she really wants, George,
is another dance with you.

975
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:43,678
-Oh, very well.
-lf it´s that much of a chore--

976
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:46,407
-Not for me!
-You´ve already been too attentive!

977
01:01:46,481 --> 01:01:48,312
George, please.

978
01:01:48,383 --> 01:01:50,510
What will the neighbors think?

979
01:01:54,489 --> 01:01:57,151
-The course of true love.
-Gathers no moss.

980
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,334
Boy, champagne.

981
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:13,137
Just the bottle.
l´m going on a picnic.

982
01:02:16,511 --> 01:02:19,878
-You´re leaving us, Jock?
-Rather, but l´ll be back.

983
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:22,143
Come on, darling, champagne!

984
01:02:22,217 --> 01:02:24,276
And again and again and again!

985
01:02:31,693 --> 01:02:33,490
Follow that cab!

986
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:35,722
-What cab, sir?
-No cab.

987
01:02:35,797 --> 01:02:39,858
Some joke, huh? Take me to
the C.K. Dexter Haven mansion.

988
01:02:39,934 --> 01:02:42,528
-Mr. Haven?
-Front entrance.

989
01:02:48,743 --> 01:02:50,608
C.K. Dexter Haven!

990
01:02:55,383 --> 01:02:57,317
This is where
Cinderella gets off.

991
01:02:57,385 --> 01:03:01,719
You hurry back to the ball before you
turn into a pumpkin and six white mice.

992
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,951
Good-bye.
C.K. Dexter Haven.

993
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:10,657
-What´s up?
-You are.

994
01:03:10,732 --> 01:03:12,666
l hope it´s worth it.
Come on in.

995
01:03:12,734 --> 01:03:14,895
l bring you greetings.

996
01:03:14,969 --> 01:03:18,302
Cinderella´s slipper.
lt´s called champagne.

997
01:03:18,373 --> 01:03:21,536
Champagne is a great ""levelerer.""
Leveler.

998
01:03:21,609 --> 01:03:24,840
-lt makes you my equal.
-l wouldn´t quite say that.

999
01:03:24,913 --> 01:03:27,313
Well, almost my equal.

1000
01:03:27,382 --> 01:03:30,317
C.K. Dexter Haven,
l would like to talk to you.

1001
01:03:30,385 --> 01:03:32,751
Let´s go in the talking room.

1002
01:03:36,658 --> 01:03:40,116
-Don´t tell me the party´s over so soon.
-No, no.

1003
01:03:40,195 --> 01:03:43,562
-l just felt like talking to you.
-Well, that´s nice.

1004
01:03:52,774 --> 01:03:55,072
l wonder if l might
borrow a drink.

1005
01:03:55,143 --> 01:03:57,668
Certainly.
Coals to Newcastle.

1006
01:03:57,746 --> 01:03:59,680
Here, sit down.

1007
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:12,587
Excuse me.

1008
01:04:24,939 --> 01:04:26,463
What´s this?

1009
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:29,637
-ls it my book?
-Yes.

1010
01:04:29,711 --> 01:04:32,612
C.K. Dexter Haven,
you have unsuspected depth.

1011
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,740
-Thanks, old chap.
-But have you read it?

1012
01:04:35,817 --> 01:04:38,479
l was trying to stop drinking.
l read anything.

1013
01:04:38,553 --> 01:04:42,250
-And did you stop drinking?
-Yes. Your book didn´t do it, though.

1014
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,087
Are you still in love with her?

1015
01:04:48,163 --> 01:04:51,599
Or perhaps you´d consider that
a very personal question.

1016
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:54,396
-Not at all.
-Liz thinks you are!

1017
01:04:54,469 --> 01:04:55,834
Liz thinks you are.

1018
01:04:55,904 --> 01:04:59,601
But of course, women like to romanti--
romanticize about things.

1019
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:02,973
-Yes, they do, don´t they?
-Yes, they do, don´t they?

1020
01:05:03,044 --> 01:05:06,241
l can´t understand how you
could´ve been married to her...

1021
01:05:06,314 --> 01:05:08,248
and still know
so little about her.

1022
01:05:08,316 --> 01:05:10,250
-Can´t you?
-No, l can´t you.

1023
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:15,745
l have the hiccups. l wonder
if l might have another drink?

1024
01:05:15,824 --> 01:05:17,758
-Certainly.
-Thank you.

1025
01:05:24,899 --> 01:05:27,265
You know, Tracy´s
no ordinary woman...

1026
01:05:27,335 --> 01:05:30,270
and you said some things to her
this afternoon l resented.

1027
01:05:30,338 --> 01:05:33,171
-l apologize, Mr. Connor.
-That´s quite all right.

1028
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:37,610
But when a girl is like Tracy,
she´s one in a million. She´s--

1029
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:40,375
She´s sort of like a--
She´s sort of like a--

1030
01:05:40,448 --> 01:05:42,313
-A goddess?
-No, no, no!

1031
01:05:42,383 --> 01:05:45,682
You said that word
this afternoon. No.

1032
01:05:48,022 --> 01:05:50,320
She´s sort of like a queen...

1033
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,223
a radiant, glorious queen...

1034
01:05:56,564 --> 01:05:59,032
and you can´t treat her
like other women.

1035
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:03,434
No, l suppose not. But then, l imagine
Kittredge appreciates all that.

1036
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:06,440
Kittredge!
Kittredge appreciates Kittredge!

1037
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:09,773
Ah, that fake ""man of the people.""
He isn´t even smart.

1038
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:12,677
He´s a five-cent edition
of Sidney Kidd.

1039
01:06:14,082 --> 01:06:17,609
Well, l always thought Kidd himself
was the five-cent kid.

1040
01:06:17,685 --> 01:06:21,086
And what´s that make you worth,
C.K. Dexter Haven...

1041
01:06:21,155 --> 01:06:23,180
bringing us down here?

1042
01:06:23,258 --> 01:06:27,319
But you know why l did that.
To get even with my ex-bride.

1043
01:06:27,395 --> 01:06:29,693
Doggone it, C.K. Dexter Haven...

1044
01:06:29,764 --> 01:06:32,961
either l´m gonna sock you
or you´re gonna sock me!

1045
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:35,025
Shall we toss a coin?

1046
01:06:37,005 --> 01:06:40,532
Kidd´s just using you
like he uses everybody else.

1047
01:06:42,343 --> 01:06:45,141
You don´t know Kidd
like l know him.

1048
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:50,207
The guy´s colossal. He´s terrific.
He´s got everybody fooled.

1049
01:06:50,285 --> 01:06:52,651
Yes.

1050
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,180
""No mean Machiavelli
is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd.

1051
01:06:57,258 --> 01:07:00,318
""The world´s his oyster
with an ´R´ in every month.""

1052
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:03,364
That´s not bad.
When did l say that?

1053
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:04,989
You didn´t. l did.
Sorry.

1054
01:07:05,066 --> 01:07:08,035
l suppose you never heard about
Kidd´s arrangement in Kansas City?

1055
01:07:08,102 --> 01:07:09,592
-No.
-ln San Francisco?

1056
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:12,037
Let me tell you about
the time he went to Boston...

1057
01:07:12,106 --> 01:07:15,439
to be awarded the Sarah Langley
Medal for World Peace.

1058
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,673
The true story on that
little jaunt would ruin him.

1059
01:07:23,284 --> 01:07:26,481
Look, Connor. What would happen
to you if l used this stuff?

1060
01:07:26,554 --> 01:07:29,182
-Why?
-l might want to, very much.

1061
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:32,055
Kidd is holding a dirty piece
on Tracy´s father.

1062
01:07:32,126 --> 01:07:34,686
-This might stop him.
-On Tracy´s father?

1063
01:07:34,762 --> 01:07:36,753
That´s right.

1064
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:41,265
Oh, so that´s how
Kidd got you to--

1065
01:07:41,336 --> 01:07:44,464
That´s how Liz and l were gotten in.
Blackmail, huh?

1066
01:07:44,539 --> 01:07:47,064
We all rode into this thing
on a filthy blackmail.

1067
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:50,235
Look, you use it.
Use it with my blessings.

1068
01:07:50,311 --> 01:07:53,769
l´m through anyway. l´m not gonna
hand in a story on this wedding.

1069
01:07:53,848 --> 01:07:57,284
-l´m gonna write one on Kidd.
-No, let me do it.

1070
01:07:57,352 --> 01:07:59,616
l don´t have to tell him
where l got my facts. Okay?

1071
01:07:59,687 --> 01:08:02,383
-Okay.
-All right, come on.

1072
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:07,086
Now shoot.

1073
01:08:07,161 --> 01:08:09,095
Peace medal. Boston.

1074
01:08:09,163 --> 01:08:12,326
Oh, oh.
The time: May, 1938.

1075
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,460
The place:
Boston, in a hotel.

1076
01:08:15,536 --> 01:08:17,265
Kidd had just arrived.

1077
01:08:17,338 --> 01:08:20,705
And this same Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen of America...

1078
01:08:20,775 --> 01:08:24,541
this protector of American democracy
and homes and firesides...

1079
01:08:24,612 --> 01:08:26,944
was at that very moment
entertaining...

1080
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:30,075
the South Carolina Mata Hari
on his yacht.

1081
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:32,244
Don´t interrupt me!

1082
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,914
This Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen...

1083
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:37,651
who demanded the respect...

1084
01:08:37,725 --> 01:08:40,159
of all who were
connected with him--

1085
01:08:40,228 --> 01:08:43,061
-We´ve come for the body of Macaulay.
-l´m glad you came.

1086
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:46,464
-Can you use a typewriter?
-No, thanks. l have one at home.

1087
01:08:48,536 --> 01:08:49,468
Who´s that?

1088
01:08:49,537 --> 01:08:52,802
Here was Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen...

1089
01:08:52,874 --> 01:08:55,468
Sidney Kidd the good,
Sidney Kidd the noble--

1090
01:08:55,543 --> 01:08:57,306
Where´s Kittredge?

1091
01:08:57,378 --> 01:08:58,970
-The people´s choice?
-Yeah.

1092
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:02,539
His bride just dropped him at
the gatehouse after a slight explosion.

1093
01:09:02,617 --> 01:09:03,879
A fight?

1094
01:09:03,951 --> 01:09:06,351
Fifteen rounds, no decision.

1095
01:09:06,421 --> 01:09:08,753
Where´s my wandering parakeet?

1096
01:09:27,108 --> 01:09:29,042
You look beautiful, Red.

1097
01:09:33,915 --> 01:09:35,507
Come on in.

1098
01:09:37,552 --> 01:09:39,486
Why?

1099
01:09:39,554 --> 01:09:42,045
No particular reason.
A drink, maybe?

1100
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,126
l don´t drink.

1101
01:09:46,194 --> 01:09:48,355
That´s right. l forgot.

1102
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:52,324
l haven´t.

1103
01:09:57,405 --> 01:09:59,930
Show Liz to a typewriter
and stand back.

1104
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:02,134
-Can she do it?
-She can and she will.

1105
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:05,202
-Dictate to her and then bring her home.
-Aren´t you coming, Liz?

1106
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:07,713
lt seems l´ve got to
commit suicide first.

1107
01:10:07,782 --> 01:10:09,977
-Going my way, Miss?
-Miss Goddess to you.

1108
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:12,246
Okay, Miss Goddess to me.

1109
01:10:48,956 --> 01:10:52,756
Champagne´s funny stuff.
l´m used to whiskey.

1110
01:10:52,827 --> 01:10:56,285
Whiskey´s a slap on the back,
and champagne´s...

1111
01:10:56,364 --> 01:10:58,992
heavy mist before my eyes.

1112
01:11:01,302 --> 01:11:03,668
Do you hear a telephone ringing?

1113
01:11:03,738 --> 01:11:06,229
l did a little while ago.
Let´s see.

1114
01:11:08,676 --> 01:11:10,268
No, not yet.

1115
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:15,540
Now l do, far away.

1116
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,081
lt´s my bedroom telephone.

1117
01:11:23,024 --> 01:11:25,720
lt couldn´t be anyone but George.

1118
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:28,353
l was sort of swinish to him.

1119
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:31,193
Perhaps l´d better go
and see what--

1120
01:11:38,472 --> 01:11:40,406
lt isn´t ringing anymore.

1121
01:11:42,176 --> 01:11:43,803
l tell you what.

1122
01:11:43,878 --> 01:11:46,244
Let´s have a quick swim
to brighten us up.

1123
01:11:46,314 --> 01:11:48,305
Dexter and l always
swam after parties.

1124
01:11:48,382 --> 01:11:50,748
Let´s dip into this instead, huh?

1125
01:11:55,056 --> 01:11:57,820
-Hello, you.
-Hello.

1126
01:11:57,892 --> 01:12:00,326
-You look fine.
-l feel fine.

1127
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:03,263
Did you enjoy the party?

1128
01:12:03,331 --> 01:12:05,799
Sure. Sure.

1129
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:08,734
The prettiest sight
in this fine, pretty world...

1130
01:12:08,803 --> 01:12:12,705
is the privileged class
enjoying its privileges.

1131
01:12:12,773 --> 01:12:16,300
-You´re a snob, Connor.
-No doubt. No doubt.

1132
01:12:16,377 --> 01:12:18,470
""Awash with champagne...

1133
01:12:18,546 --> 01:12:21,379
""was Will Q. Tracy´s
pleasure dome...

1134
01:12:21,449 --> 01:12:25,317
""on the nuptial eve
of Tracy Samantha--Tracy--""

1135
01:12:30,391 --> 01:12:32,882
You can´t marry that guy.

1136
01:12:33,761 --> 01:12:37,253
George? l´m going to.

1137
01:12:37,331 --> 01:12:39,128
-Why not?
-l don´t know.

1138
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,294
l thought l´d be for it at first,
but you don´t seem to match up.

1139
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:43,962
Then the fault´s with me.

1140
01:12:44,038 --> 01:12:46,336
Maybe so. But all the same,
you can´t do it.

1141
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:50,404
Come around about noon tomorrow.

1142
01:12:50,478 --> 01:12:52,412
l mean today.

1143
01:12:53,981 --> 01:12:56,882
-Snob.
-What do you mean, ""snob""?

1144
01:12:56,951 --> 01:13:01,718
You´re the worst kind there is,
an intellectual snob.

1145
01:13:01,789 --> 01:13:04,917
You made up your mind
awfully young, it seems to me.

1146
01:13:04,992 --> 01:13:07,222
Thirty´s about time
to make up your mind.

1147
01:13:07,295 --> 01:13:09,490
And l´m nothing of the sort.
Not Mr. Connor.

1148
01:13:09,563 --> 01:13:13,556
The time to make up
your mind about people...

1149
01:13:13,634 --> 01:13:15,226
is never.

1150
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:19,262
Yes, you are,
and a complete one.

1151
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,604
-You´re quite a girl, aren´t you?
-You think?

1152
01:13:21,676 --> 01:13:24,702
-Yeah, l know.
-l don´t think l´m exceptional.

1153
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:28,146
-You are, though.
-l know any number like me.

1154
01:13:28,215 --> 01:13:30,479
You oughta get around more.

1155
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:35,181
What, in the upper class?

1156
01:13:35,256 --> 01:13:37,656
No, no.
No, thank you.

1157
01:13:37,725 --> 01:13:41,889
You´re just a mass
of prejudices, aren´t you?

1158
01:13:41,963 --> 01:13:45,592
You´re so much thought
and so little feeling, Professor.

1159
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:48,829
-l am, am l?
-Yes, you am, are you.

1160
01:13:48,903 --> 01:13:52,600
Your intolerance infuriates me!

1161
01:13:52,673 --> 01:13:55,938
l should think that, of all people,
a writer would need tolerance.

1162
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,945
That fact is you´ll never,
you can´t be...

1163
01:13:59,013 --> 01:14:01,538
a first-rate writer
or a first-rate human being...

1164
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:05,608
until you´ve learned to have
some small regard for human fra--

1165
01:14:10,091 --> 01:14:14,323
Aren´t the geraniums
pretty, Professor?

1166
01:14:16,263 --> 01:14:19,096
ls it not a handsome day...

1167
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:21,999
that begins, Professor?

1168
01:14:22,069 --> 01:14:24,594
-Lay off that ""Professor.""
-Yes, Professor.

1169
01:14:24,672 --> 01:14:27,334
You´ve got all the arrogance
of your class, all right.

1170
01:14:27,408 --> 01:14:30,206
How--what have classes
to do with it?

1171
01:14:30,277 --> 01:14:32,472
What do they matter
except for the people in them?

1172
01:14:32,546 --> 01:14:36,778
George comes from the so-called lower
class; Dexter from the upper. Well?

1173
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:40,912
Mac, the night watchman, is a prince
among men; Uncle Willie is a pincher.

1174
01:14:42,556 --> 01:14:45,616
Upper and lower, my eye.
l´ll take the lower, thanks.

1175
01:14:45,693 --> 01:14:47,422
lf you can´t get a drawing room.

1176
01:14:47,495 --> 01:14:49,429
-What do you mean by that?
-My mistake.

1177
01:14:49,497 --> 01:14:51,465
-You´re insulting!
-l´m sorry.

1178
01:14:51,532 --> 01:14:55,161
-Oh, don´t apologize!
-Who´s apologizing?

1179
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:57,831
l never knew such a man.

1180
01:14:57,905 --> 01:15:00,305
You wouldn´t be likely to,
not from where you sit.

1181
01:15:00,374 --> 01:15:02,535
Talk about arrogance.

1182
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:06,045
-Tracy.
-What do you want?

1183
01:15:07,381 --> 01:15:09,440
You´re wonderful.

1184
01:15:12,353 --> 01:15:15,049
There´s a magnificence
in you, Tracy.

1185
01:15:17,858 --> 01:15:20,827
Now l´m getting self-conscious.

1186
01:15:20,895 --> 01:15:23,090
lt´s funny, l--

1187
01:15:27,935 --> 01:15:29,027
Yeah?

1188
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:34,802
l don´t know.
Go up, l guess. lt´s late.

1189
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:40,073
A magnificence that comes out
of your eyes and your voice...

1190
01:15:40,147 --> 01:15:43,082
in the way you stand there,
in the way you walk.

1191
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,175
You´re lit from within, Tracy.

1192
01:15:45,252 --> 01:15:48,585
You´ve got fires
banked down in you...

1193
01:15:48,656 --> 01:15:52,285
hearth fires and holocausts!

1194
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:58,564
l don´t seem to you
made of bronze?

1195
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,299
No. You´re made out
of flesh and blood.

1196
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:06,362
That´s the blank,
unholy surprise of it.

1197
01:16:07,441 --> 01:16:10,308
You´re the golden girl, Tracy...

1198
01:16:10,377 --> 01:16:13,972
full of life and warmth
and delight.

1199
01:16:16,217 --> 01:16:19,653
What goes on?
You got tears in your eyes.

1200
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,585
Shut up. Shut up.

1201
01:16:21,655 --> 01:16:24,021
Oh, Mike, keep talking.
Keep talking.

1202
01:16:24,091 --> 01:16:26,025
Talk, will you?

1203
01:16:28,996 --> 01:16:31,556
No, no, l´ve--

1204
01:16:31,632 --> 01:16:33,293
l´ve stopped.

1205
01:16:34,869 --> 01:16:36,632
Why?

1206
01:16:36,704 --> 01:16:41,198
Has your mind taken hold again,
dear Professor?

1207
01:16:42,343 --> 01:16:45,779
Well, it´s a good thing,
don´t you agree?

1208
01:16:45,846 --> 01:16:46,972
No, Professor.

1209
01:16:47,047 --> 01:16:49,174
Lay off that ""Professor"" stuff!
Do you hear me?

1210
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,013
Yes, Professor.

1211
01:16:54,054 --> 01:16:56,488
-That´s all l am to you?
-Of course, Professor.

1212
01:16:56,557 --> 01:16:59,185
-Are you sure?
-Why, yes, of course--

1213
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:04,563
Golly.

1214
01:17:10,938 --> 01:17:12,371
-Golly Moses!
-Tracy.

1215
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:14,464
-Mr. Connor--
-Let me tell you something.

1216
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:17,306
-l´ve got the shakes.
-lt can´t be anything like love, can it?

1217
01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:19,744
No, no, it mustn´t be.
lt can´t.

1218
01:17:19,813 --> 01:17:22,839
-Would it be inconvenient?
-Terribly.

1219
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:24,885
Anyway, l know it isn´t.

1220
01:17:24,952 --> 01:17:27,386
-Mike, we´re out of our minds.
-Right into our hearts.

1221
01:17:27,454 --> 01:17:29,979
-That ought to have music.
-lt does, doesn´t it?

1222
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:33,322
lt´s as if my insteps
were melting away.

1223
01:17:33,394 --> 01:17:36,090
-Have l got feet of clay?
-Tracy.

1224
01:17:36,163 --> 01:17:38,757
lt´s not far to the pool.
lt´s in the birch grove.

1225
01:17:38,832 --> 01:17:41,130
-lt´ll be lovely now.
-Tracy, you´re tremendous.

1226
01:17:41,202 --> 01:17:43,193
Put me in your pocket, Mike.

1227
01:17:58,352 --> 01:18:00,752
l can´t imagine what
makes me so sleepy.

1228
01:18:00,821 --> 01:18:04,222
-lt couldn´t be the company.
-lt´s you, Mr. Dexter.

1229
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,851
-Hello, Mac.
-l heard you were about.

1230
01:18:06,927 --> 01:18:09,862
-Any prowlers around?
-No prowlers.

1231
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:13,559
-Can Miss lmbrie get in this way?
-lf she can´t, you can go in the back.

1232
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:15,067
Good.

1233
01:18:18,472 --> 01:18:20,633
-Thanks, Mac. Good night.
-Good night, sir.

1234
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:25,008
Well, home after
a hard day´s blackmailing.

1235
01:18:26,447 --> 01:18:29,109
When are you going
to telephone Kidd?

1236
01:18:29,183 --> 01:18:31,344
ln time to get him here
for the wedding.

1237
01:18:31,418 --> 01:18:32,851
Why?

1238
01:18:33,754 --> 01:18:37,155
A sort of wedding present,
if it works.

1239
01:18:38,292 --> 01:18:40,055
lf it works.

1240
01:18:41,028 --> 01:18:43,553
l could still tear it up.

1241
01:18:43,631 --> 01:18:48,534
No. Mike´s only chance to ever become
a really fine writer is to get fired.

1242
01:18:49,403 --> 01:18:51,394
You´re a good number, Liz.

1243
01:18:51,472 --> 01:18:54,202
Oh, l just photograph well.

1244
01:18:55,276 --> 01:18:57,836
l´m certainly out of focus now.

1245
01:18:57,911 --> 01:19:00,004
Why don´t you take a swim?

1246
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,105
-A swim?
-Sure.

1247
01:19:02,182 --> 01:19:05,276
Tracy and l always
took a swim after a party.

1248
01:19:05,352 --> 01:19:07,445
-Did you?
-Mm-hmm.

1249
01:19:07,521 --> 01:19:09,216
Bet it was fun.

1250
01:19:10,491 --> 01:19:12,925
l´ll have to try it
with Mike sometime.

1251
01:19:14,128 --> 01:19:16,790
Liz, why don´t you marry him?

1252
01:19:17,798 --> 01:19:19,993
-You really want to know?
-Mm-hmm.

1253
01:19:20,934 --> 01:19:23,300
He´s still got a lot to learn.

1254
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:25,964
l don´t want to get
in his way for a while.

1255
01:19:30,611 --> 01:19:32,545
lt´s risky though, Liz.

1256
01:19:32,613 --> 01:19:34,843
Suppose another girl
came along in the meantime?

1257
01:19:34,915 --> 01:19:37,645
l´d scratch her eyes out,
l guess.

1258
01:19:37,718 --> 01:19:41,154
That is, unless she was going to
marry somebody else the next day.

1259
01:20:03,777 --> 01:20:06,211
-Hello, Kittredge.
-What are you doing here?

1260
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,544
l´m a friend of the family´s.
Dropped in for a chat.

1261
01:20:08,615 --> 01:20:11,175
Don´t try to be funny.
l asked you a question.

1262
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:13,719
l could ask you
the same question.

1263
01:20:13,787 --> 01:20:15,982
l telephoned Tracy,
and her phone didn´t answer.

1264
01:20:16,056 --> 01:20:18,286
l was worried,
so l walked over.

1265
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:21,351
-l was worried too.
-About what?

1266
01:20:21,428 --> 01:20:24,955
What do you think of
this fellow Connor, or do you?

1267
01:20:25,032 --> 01:20:26,624
lf you´re trying to insinuate--

1268
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,931
My dear chap, l wouldn´t
insinuate anything, only--

1269
01:20:37,211 --> 01:20:39,145
Kittredge,
l´d advise you to go to bed.

1270
01:20:39,213 --> 01:20:41,545
l don´t want your advice.
l´m staying right here.

1271
01:20:41,615 --> 01:20:45,016
You´re making a mistake.
Somehow l don´t think you´ll understand.

1272
01:20:45,085 --> 01:20:48,851
-Maybe you´d better leave that to--
-Dreams really do come true

1273
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:52,484
Someday l´ll wish upon a star

1274
01:20:52,559 --> 01:20:55,187
-What´s that?
-lt´s Mac, the night watchman.

1275
01:20:55,262 --> 01:20:57,321
Always singing.
l´ll walk you around the house.

1276
01:20:57,398 --> 01:21:00,492
Something´s going on here,
and l´m staying.

1277
01:21:00,567 --> 01:21:02,228
And so are you.

1278
01:21:02,302 --> 01:21:05,032
All right, then.
Take the works.

1279
01:21:05,105 --> 01:21:07,573
Only heaven help you.

1280
01:21:07,641 --> 01:21:11,839
Somewhere over the rainbow

1281
01:21:11,912 --> 01:21:14,278
Way up high

1282
01:21:14,348 --> 01:21:17,340
There´s a land
that l heard of

1283
01:21:17,418 --> 01:21:20,216
Once in a lullaby

1284
01:21:26,293 --> 01:21:29,524
And the dreams

1285
01:21:29,596 --> 01:21:32,190
That l dare to dre--

1286
01:21:32,266 --> 01:21:34,791
-Uh-oh.
-Don´t stop, Mikey.

1287
01:21:34,868 --> 01:21:36,460
Keep crooning.

1288
01:21:39,273 --> 01:21:44,142
Someday over the rainbow

1289
01:21:44,211 --> 01:21:46,441
Way up high

1290
01:21:46,513 --> 01:21:49,448
-What is this, Connor?
-Easy, old man. She´s not hurt?

1291
01:21:49,516 --> 01:21:53,543
-No, no.
-Not wounded, sire, but dead.

1292
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:56,919
Seems the minute she hit the water,
the wine hit her.

1293
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:59,288
-Look here, Connor.
-A likely story!

1294
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,487
-What´d you say?
-A likely story!

1295
01:22:02,563 --> 01:22:04,497
-lf you think that--
-You´ll be down directly?

1296
01:22:04,565 --> 01:22:06,362
-Yes, if you want!
-l want.

1297
01:22:07,134 --> 01:22:08,761
Hello, Dexter.

1298
01:22:08,836 --> 01:22:10,701
Hello, George.

1299
01:22:11,672 --> 01:22:13,264
Hello, Mike.

1300
01:22:21,782 --> 01:22:24,273
Second door to the right,
top of the stairs. Don´t wake Dinah.

1301
01:22:24,351 --> 01:22:26,751
My feet are made of clay.
Did you know?

1302
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:29,015
Good night, little man.

1303
01:22:32,826 --> 01:22:35,260
How are the mighty fallen.

1304
01:22:38,732 --> 01:22:40,996
lf l know Tracy,
and l know her well...

1305
01:22:41,068 --> 01:22:43,229
she´ll remember little of this.

1306
01:22:43,303 --> 01:22:46,170
For the second time in her life,
she´ll draw quite a tidy blank.

1307
01:22:50,043 --> 01:22:52,876
-You don´t believe it, then?
-Believe what?

1308
01:22:52,946 --> 01:22:56,609
Well, the implications of
what you saw, let us say.

1309
01:22:56,683 --> 01:22:59,846
-What else am l to believe?
-That´s entirely up to you.

1310
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,151
l got eyes, l got imagination,
haven´t l?

1311
01:23:03,223 --> 01:23:05,214
l don´t know.
Have you?

1312
01:23:05,292 --> 01:23:08,056
Oh, so you pretend
not to believe it.

1313
01:23:08,128 --> 01:23:10,062
Yes, l pretend not to.

1314
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:12,360
-Then you don´t know women.
-That´s possible.

1315
01:23:12,432 --> 01:23:14,923
-And you´re a fool.
-That´s quite possible.

1316
01:23:16,103 --> 01:23:19,129
-You won´t be too hard on her?
-l´ll make up my own mind what l´ll be!

1317
01:23:19,206 --> 01:23:20,969
We´re all only human, you know.

1318
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:24,101
You! All of you with
your sophisticated ideas!

1319
01:23:24,912 --> 01:23:26,573
Ain´t it awful?

1320
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:34,881
Why, you low--

1321
01:23:37,624 --> 01:23:39,057
What right have you--

1322
01:23:39,126 --> 01:23:41,720
A husband´s.
´Til tomorrow, Kittredge.

1323
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:47,166
Hey, fella.

1324
01:23:48,368 --> 01:23:50,962
How do you feel?

1325
01:23:51,038 --> 01:23:52,972
-lf you think l--
-l know.

1326
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,736
l´m sorry. l thought l´d better
hit you before he did.

1327
01:23:55,809 --> 01:23:58,801
He´s in better shape than l am.

1328
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:00,744
Well, you´ll do.

1329
01:24:02,916 --> 01:24:05,942
Hello, Mr. Dexter.
Anything wrong?

1330
01:24:06,019 --> 01:24:08,647
Not a thing, Mac.
Just as quiet as a church.

1331
01:24:08,722 --> 01:24:10,656
Who is it?

1332
01:24:14,094 --> 01:24:17,154
Doggone. l thought it
might´ve been Mr. Kittredge.

1333
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:19,130
We can´t have everything, Mac.

1334
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,927
Good night.

1335
01:24:46,627 --> 01:24:48,652
-Mr. Tracy--
-Good grief, man.

1336
01:24:48,729 --> 01:24:51,459
Don´t scream at me at the top
of your voice like that.

1337
01:24:51,531 --> 01:24:53,590
Miss Dinah is waiting for you, sir.

1338
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:56,067
Miss Dinah waiting for me?
Where and why?

1339
01:24:56,136 --> 01:24:58,468
Just outside the door, sir.
l don´t know why.

1340
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:01,769
This is one of those days
which the pages of history teach us...

1341
01:25:01,842 --> 01:25:04,333
are best spent lying in bed.

1342
01:25:11,451 --> 01:25:13,112
Uncle Willie!

1343
01:25:14,187 --> 01:25:16,246
Uncle Willie,
where are you going?

1344
01:25:16,323 --> 01:25:18,257
Back to bed, unless you
give me your oath...

1345
01:25:18,325 --> 01:25:20,259
you will speak in
a civilized tone of voice.

1346
01:25:20,327 --> 01:25:23,660
l´ll be quiet, Uncle Willie.
lt´s so important that l see you.

1347
01:25:23,730 --> 01:25:27,359
Must we ride in that thing? Wouldn´t we
be more comfortable on pogo sticks?

1348
01:25:27,434 --> 01:25:30,631
l had to be alone with you,
and this is very intimate.

1349
01:25:42,716 --> 01:25:45,082
-What´s the matter?
-Oh, nothing much.

1350
01:25:45,152 --> 01:25:47,086
My head just fell off, that´s all.

1351
01:25:48,855 --> 01:25:52,586
What is all this gibberish
about Mr. Connor?

1352
01:25:52,659 --> 01:25:55,651
What makes you suspect what
and since when?

1353
01:25:55,729 --> 01:25:59,096
Last night,
and well into the morning.

1354
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:01,657
Uncle Willie,
isn´t my duty to tell George?

1355
01:26:01,735 --> 01:26:03,498
He might want to marry her anyway.

1356
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:07,506
But she can´t. lf she marries anyone,
it´s got to be Mr. Connor.

1357
01:26:07,574 --> 01:26:10,702
Why, Dinah.
What makes you think she should?

1358
01:26:10,777 --> 01:26:13,803
Apparently the little cherub
has heard or seen something.

1359
01:26:14,881 --> 01:26:16,872
That´s Dexter´s own Dinah.

1360
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:20,283
You have a certain amount of cheek
walking in here on this of all mornings.

1361
01:26:20,353 --> 01:26:22,719
-Do l?
-Yes.

1362
01:26:22,789 --> 01:26:24,723
What´s all this
about Mr. Connor, Dinah?

1363
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,089
Did the party last night
give you bad dreams?

1364
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,993
-lt wasn´t any dream.
-l wouldn´t be too sure.

1365
01:26:30,063 --> 01:26:32,395
lt´s hard to tell once you´ve
gone to sleep, isn´t it?

1366
01:26:32,466 --> 01:26:33,728
ls it?

1367
01:26:35,469 --> 01:26:38,233
What-ho, the bride.

1368
01:26:44,644 --> 01:26:45,906
Hello.

1369
01:26:46,713 --> 01:26:50,205
Um, isn´t it a fine day, though.

1370
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:54,882
ls everybody fine?

1371
01:26:56,123 --> 01:26:57,522
That´s fine.

1372
01:26:59,326 --> 01:27:01,260
My, l´m hearty.

1373
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:05,364
How do you feel otherwise?

1374
01:27:05,432 --> 01:27:07,423
l don´t know what´s the matter with me.

1375
01:27:07,501 --> 01:27:09,469
l must have had
too much sun yesterday.

1376
01:27:09,536 --> 01:27:12,164
-My eyes don´t open properly.
-Really?

1377
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:15,766
Ugh! Please go home, Dext.

1378
01:27:15,842 --> 01:27:17,867
Not until we´ve got
those eyes open.

1379
01:27:17,944 --> 01:27:20,139
Uncle Willie. Good morning.

1380
01:27:20,213 --> 01:27:21,942
That remains to be seen.

1381
01:27:23,283 --> 01:27:25,478
Aren´t you here early,
Uncle Willie?

1382
01:27:25,552 --> 01:27:27,952
lt´s nearly half past twelve.

1383
01:27:28,021 --> 01:27:29,989
lt can´t be.
Where´s Mother?

1384
01:27:30,056 --> 01:27:32,889
She´s talking with the orchestra.
Father with the minister.

1385
01:27:32,959 --> 01:27:36,759
And Mr. Connor,
he hasn´t come down yet.

1386
01:27:38,098 --> 01:27:40,032
And it´s Saturday,
your wedding day, remember?

1387
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:43,092
Thanks loads.
lt´s nice to have things account--

1388
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,104
Only l wonder
what this might be.

1389
01:27:45,172 --> 01:27:47,197
-That looks like a wristwatch.
-But whose?

1390
01:27:47,274 --> 01:27:49,469
l found it in my room.
l nearly stepped on it.

1391
01:27:54,181 --> 01:27:58,379
Also, l think l was robbed at your house
last night, Uncle Willie.

1392
01:27:58,451 --> 01:28:00,976
My bracelet and engagement rings
are missing--

1393
01:28:01,054 --> 01:28:04,080
-Here you are.
-But you weren´t at the party.

1394
01:28:04,157 --> 01:28:05,647
-Wasn´t l?
-Were you?

1395
01:28:05,725 --> 01:28:08,421
Don´t tell me you don´t remember.

1396
01:28:08,495 --> 01:28:11,896
l do, now, sort of.

1397
01:28:11,965 --> 01:28:15,264
But there were such a lot of people.
l stayed so late.

1398
01:28:15,335 --> 01:28:17,394
You should have taken a quick swim
when you got home.

1399
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:18,767
A swim?

1400
01:28:19,506 --> 01:28:21,235
A swim!

1401
01:28:21,308 --> 01:28:23,139
There! Now they´re open.

1402
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:27,112
That was just the beginning,
and it was no dream.

1403
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:31,440
Do you suppose,
speaking of eye-openers--

1404
01:28:31,518 --> 01:28:34,351
That´s the first sane remark
l´ve heard today. Come along.

1405
01:28:34,421 --> 01:28:38,016
l know a formula that can pop pennies
off the eyelids of dead lrishmen.

1406
01:28:39,292 --> 01:28:41,453
Dinah, if the conversation
should lag...

1407
01:28:41,528 --> 01:28:44,122
you might tell Tracy
about your dream.

1408
01:28:44,197 --> 01:28:46,867
-What did he say?
-Oh, nothing.

1409
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:47,299
-What did he say?
-Oh, nothing.

1410
01:28:47,367 --> 01:28:49,892
Tray, l hate you to get married
and go away.

1411
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:53,269
l´ll miss you, darling.
l´ll miss all of you.

1412
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:57,367
You know, l did have the funniest
dream about you last night.

1413
01:28:57,444 --> 01:28:59,605
Did you? Do you like
my dress, Dinah?

1414
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:02,648
-Yes, ever so much.
-Feels awfully heavy.

1415
01:29:02,716 --> 01:29:05,116
lt was all certainly
pretty rooty-tooty.

1416
01:29:05,185 --> 01:29:07,710
-What was?
-My dream.

1417
01:29:07,787 --> 01:29:10,950
l dreamed l got up
and went over to the window.

1418
01:29:11,024 --> 01:29:13,959
Guess what l dreamed l saw coming over
out of the woods.

1419
01:29:14,027 --> 01:29:17,053
l haven´t the faintest idea.
A skunk?

1420
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:20,691
Well, sort of.
lt was Mr. Connor.

1421
01:29:20,767 --> 01:29:22,200
Mr. Connor?

1422
01:29:22,269 --> 01:29:27,366
Yes, with his arms full of something,
and guess what it turned out to be.

1423
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,705
-What?
-You, and some clothes.

1424
01:29:30,777 --> 01:29:35,305
Wasn´t it funny? lt was sort of like
as if you were coming from the pool.

1425
01:29:36,683 --> 01:29:38,674
The pool?

1426
01:29:38,752 --> 01:29:42,279
l´m going crazy. l´m standing here,
solidly, on my own two hands...

1427
01:29:42,355 --> 01:29:44,323
and going crazy.

1428
01:29:44,391 --> 01:29:48,725
-Then what?
-After a while, l opened my door...

1429
01:29:48,795 --> 01:29:51,320
and there he was in the hall,
still coming along with you...

1430
01:29:51,398 --> 01:29:53,696
puffing like a steam engine.

1431
01:29:53,767 --> 01:29:55,758
His wind can´t be very good.

1432
01:29:55,835 --> 01:29:57,063
Then what?

1433
01:29:57,137 --> 01:30:00,436
-You were sort of crooning.
-l never crooned in my life.

1434
01:30:00,507 --> 01:30:03,237
l´m only saying
what it sounded like.

1435
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:04,743
And then he--

1436
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:07,671
Guess what.

1437
01:30:07,747 --> 01:30:09,078
l couldn´t possibly.

1438
01:30:09,149 --> 01:30:12,380
He sailed right into your room
with you, and that scared me...

1439
01:30:12,452 --> 01:30:14,579
so l got up
and went to your door...

1440
01:30:14,654 --> 01:30:17,817
and peeked in
to make sure you were all right.

1441
01:30:17,891 --> 01:30:19,722
And guess what.

1442
01:30:20,827 --> 01:30:23,523
-What?
-You were. He was gone by then.

1443
01:30:24,431 --> 01:30:26,831
Gone?

1444
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:30,063
Of course he was gone.
He was never there.

1445
01:30:30,136 --> 01:30:31,433
l know, Tracy.

1446
01:30:31,504 --> 01:30:34,996
-l should certainly hope you did.
-l´m certainly glad l do.

1447
01:30:35,075 --> 01:30:39,569
Because if l didn´t, and in a little
while l heard the minister say...

1448
01:30:39,646 --> 01:30:43,173
""lf anyone knows any just cause
or reason why these two...

1449
01:30:43,249 --> 01:30:46,082
""should not be united
in holy matrimony--""

1450
01:30:46,152 --> 01:30:48,211
l just wouldn´t know what to do.

1451
01:30:48,288 --> 01:30:52,224
-Dexter says it´s a dream too.
-You told Dexter all that?

1452
01:30:52,292 --> 01:30:55,056
Not a word.
Not a single word.

1453
01:30:55,128 --> 01:30:56,993
You know how quick he is.

1454
01:30:57,063 --> 01:30:59,088
You little fiend.
How can you stand there--

1455
01:30:59,165 --> 01:31:01,497
Dinah, your mother wants
to have a look at you.

1456
01:31:01,568 --> 01:31:04,435
l look wonderful.
l smell good too.

1457
01:31:04,504 --> 01:31:06,495
-Father?
-Yes, Tracy.

1458
01:31:08,675 --> 01:31:11,667
l´m glad you came back.

1459
01:31:12,846 --> 01:31:14,507
l´m glad you´re here.

1460
01:31:14,581 --> 01:31:15,843
Thank you, child.

1461
01:31:17,117 --> 01:31:22,919
l´m sorry l´m--truly sorry
l´m a disappointment to you.

1462
01:31:22,989 --> 01:31:25,048
l never said that, daughter.

1463
01:31:26,526 --> 01:31:27,788
l never will.

1464
01:31:35,368 --> 01:31:37,666
-Good morning.
-Oh. Hello.

1465
01:31:40,673 --> 01:31:42,163
l´m testing the air.

1466
01:31:42,242 --> 01:31:44,472
l like it,
but it doesn´t like me.

1467
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:46,473
Hello, Dinah.

1468
01:31:46,546 --> 01:31:48,844
How do you do?

1469
01:31:48,915 --> 01:31:50,780
Did you have a good sleep?

1470
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:52,841
Wonderful. Wonderful.
And you?

1471
01:31:52,919 --> 01:31:56,047
Marvelous. Have you
ever seen a handsomer day?

1472
01:31:56,122 --> 01:31:58,420
Never, never.
What´d it set you back?

1473
01:31:58,491 --> 01:32:00,652
l got it for nothing
for being a good girl.

1474
01:32:00,727 --> 01:32:02,160
Good. Good.

1475
01:32:04,064 --> 01:32:06,328
Don´t worry, l´m going.

1476
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:07,764
Why should you?

1477
01:32:07,834 --> 01:32:10,997
l guess you must have things
you wish to discuss.

1478
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:14,063
Only remember, it´s getting late.

1479
01:32:17,377 --> 01:32:21,006
She´s always trying
to make situations.

1480
01:32:31,524 --> 01:32:34,186
-What´s the matter with your chin?
-Chin?

1481
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,728
Oh. Does it show that much?

1482
01:32:36,796 --> 01:32:38,229
A little. What happened?

1483
01:32:38,298 --> 01:32:40,823
l guess l stuck it out too far.

1484
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,130
lnto a door in the dark?

1485
01:32:43,203 --> 01:32:47,003
Yes, that´s it.
What about you? You all right?

1486
01:32:47,073 --> 01:32:48,267
-Me?
-Yeah.

1487
01:32:48,341 --> 01:32:50,866
Of course.
Why shouldn´t l be?

1488
01:32:50,944 --> 01:32:53,504
That was a flock of wine
we got away with.

1489
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,447
l guess we´re lucky
both to have such good heads.

1490
01:32:56,516 --> 01:32:59,485
Yeah, yeah, l guess that´s it.

1491
01:33:00,887 --> 01:33:03,947
Well, anyway, l...

1492
01:33:04,023 --> 01:33:07,550
l had a simply wonderful evening.
l hope you enjoyed it too.

1493
01:33:07,627 --> 01:33:09,561
l enjoyed the last part of it.

1494
01:33:10,663 --> 01:33:12,494
Really?

1495
01:33:12,565 --> 01:33:14,897
Why especially the last?

1496
01:33:14,968 --> 01:33:16,959
Tracy, are you asking me?

1497
01:33:18,571 --> 01:33:20,562
-Oh, you mean the swim.
-Yeah.

1498
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:23,074
We did swim...

1499
01:33:24,878 --> 01:33:27,312
and so forth, didn´t we?

1500
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,507
-Mike.
-Oh, Tracy, darling.

1501
01:33:30,583 --> 01:33:32,744
-What can l say to you?
-Not anything.

1502
01:33:32,819 --> 01:33:35,253
Don´t say anything
and especially not ""darling.""

1503
01:33:37,824 --> 01:33:40,224
-You´re going through with it?
-Through with what?

1504
01:33:40,293 --> 01:33:42,261
The wedding.

1505
01:33:42,328 --> 01:33:44,091
Why shouldn´t l?

1506
01:33:45,465 --> 01:33:48,263
Well, l made a funny discovery.

1507
01:33:48,334 --> 01:33:50,928
ln spite of the fact that
somebody´s up from the bottom...

1508
01:33:51,004 --> 01:33:53,131
he can still be quite a heel...

1509
01:33:53,206 --> 01:33:56,801
and even though somebody else
is born to the purple, he...

1510
01:33:56,876 --> 01:33:59,344
he can still be
a very nice guy.

1511
01:33:59,412 --> 01:34:02,870
l´m just repeating
what you said last night.

1512
01:34:02,949 --> 01:34:06,612
l said a lot of things
last night, it seems.

1513
01:34:06,686 --> 01:34:08,745
Okay. No dice.

1514
01:34:09,889 --> 01:34:12,517
Also no regrets
about last night, huh?

1515
01:34:12,592 --> 01:34:14,287
Why should l have?

1516
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,453
Tracy, you´re wonderful.

1517
01:34:16,529 --> 01:34:21,466
l´m asking you. Tell me straight out.
Tell me the reason why l should have.

1518
01:34:21,534 --> 01:34:23,468
No, don´t.

1519
01:34:23,536 --> 01:34:25,561
Just tell me, what time is it?

1520
01:34:26,272 --> 01:34:27,705
What? Oh.

1521
01:34:29,475 --> 01:34:31,602
What happened to my wristwatch?

1522
01:34:31,678 --> 01:34:33,646
Why, is it broken?

1523
01:34:33,713 --> 01:34:35,738
l must´ve lost it someplace.

1524
01:34:35,815 --> 01:34:39,615
l can´t tell you how extremely sorry
l am to hear that.

1525
01:34:41,354 --> 01:34:43,447
There. On the table.

1526
01:34:43,523 --> 01:34:47,220
l wonder who found it.
l´d offer a reward or something.

1527
01:34:47,293 --> 01:34:50,421
l don´t think that any reward
will be expected.

1528
01:34:51,631 --> 01:34:54,464
Funny that it´d pop up here.

1529
01:34:54,534 --> 01:34:58,163
Hey, what about an eye-opener?

1530
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:02,299
My eyes are opened.
Go and get one if you want to, though.

1531
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:04,343
Yeah, l think l will.
Excuse me.

1532
01:35:05,278 --> 01:35:07,041
Yes, yes.

1533
01:35:08,147 --> 01:35:10,138
Just give Mr. Kittredge a message.

1534
01:35:10,216 --> 01:35:13,208
Tell him he´d better start
immediately. Thank you.

1535
01:35:14,354 --> 01:35:16,754
-Are you one of the musicians?
-Uh, no.

1536
01:35:16,823 --> 01:35:18,984
Of course,
you´re Junius´s friend.

1537
01:35:19,058 --> 01:35:22,516
Only you´re not. You don´t have
any violin strings, do you?

1538
01:35:25,331 --> 01:35:27,424
-Aspirin. Will that do?
-l don´t think so.

1539
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,991
lt´s for a violin.
Oh, well, don´t bother.

1540
01:35:38,177 --> 01:35:41,476
-Hello, Connor. How are you?
-Just about as you´d think.

1541
01:35:41,547 --> 01:35:42,809
You seen Kidd?

1542
01:35:42,882 --> 01:35:44,816
l left a copy of it
at my house for him.

1543
01:35:44,884 --> 01:35:47,512
-And?
-l´ll tangle with him after the wedding.

1544
01:35:47,587 --> 01:35:49,885
-ls that an alcoholic beverage?
-Yes. Why?

1545
01:35:49,956 --> 01:35:52,049
-For me?
-No, for Tracy. You want one?

1546
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:55,754
l´d sell my grandmother for a drink.
You know how l love my grandmother.

1547
01:35:55,828 --> 01:35:59,286
Uncle Willie´s in the pantry
doing weird and wonderful things.

1548
01:35:59,365 --> 01:36:01,629
Tell him l said
one of the same.

1549
01:36:01,701 --> 01:36:03,328
Mind if l make it two?

1550
01:36:03,403 --> 01:36:05,394
That´s between you
and your grandmother.

1551
01:36:22,522 --> 01:36:24,285
Doctor´s orders, Red.

1552
01:36:24,357 --> 01:36:25,790
What is it?

1553
01:36:25,858 --> 01:36:28,759
Just the juice
of a few flowers.

1554
01:36:28,828 --> 01:36:31,558
lt´s a type of stinger.
Removes the sting.

1555
01:36:31,631 --> 01:36:35,397
-Oh, Dext, don´t say that.
-Why not, Red?

1556
01:36:35,468 --> 01:36:37,834
Nothing will.
Nothing ever can.

1557
01:36:41,341 --> 01:36:43,832
l´ve done the most
terrible thing to you.

1558
01:36:44,577 --> 01:36:46,169
To me?

1559
01:36:46,245 --> 01:36:48,805
l doubt that very much, dear.

1560
01:36:48,881 --> 01:36:50,815
You don´t know.

1561
01:36:50,883 --> 01:36:52,111
Maybe l shouldn´t, huh?

1562
01:36:52,185 --> 01:36:56,087
But you must. You´ve got to.
l couldn´t stand it if you didn´t.

1563
01:36:56,155 --> 01:36:58,521
Dexter, what am l going to do?

1564
01:36:58,591 --> 01:37:01,526
But why to me, darling?
Why ask me?

1565
01:37:02,795 --> 01:37:05,559
Why do l come into it anymore?

1566
01:37:05,631 --> 01:37:09,192
Aren´t you confusing me with a fellow
named Kittredge or something?

1567
01:37:09,268 --> 01:37:10,599
George!

1568
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:14,766
George. Splendid chap, George.
Very high morals.

1569
01:37:14,841 --> 01:37:16,365
Very broad shoulders.

1570
01:37:16,442 --> 01:37:18,205
l´ve got to tell him.

1571
01:37:18,277 --> 01:37:21,644
-Tell him what, darling?
-l´ve got to tell him.

1572
01:37:22,715 --> 01:37:25,411
lf you´ve got to tell him,
you´ve got to tell him.

1573
01:37:25,485 --> 01:37:28,420
lf he´s got any brains, he´ll have
realized what a fool he made of himself.

1574
01:37:28,488 --> 01:37:31,423
Hello, George?
This is--yeah.

1575
01:37:31,491 --> 01:37:33,618
l don´t care whether
it´s bad luck or not...

1576
01:37:33,693 --> 01:37:36,389
but l´ve got to see you
before the wedding.

1577
01:37:36,462 --> 01:37:39,124
What? No, l didn´t get it.

1578
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:40,961
Right. Come on the run.

1579
01:37:41,033 --> 01:37:43,058
-He sent a note over at ten.
-Good.

1580
01:37:43,136 --> 01:37:45,070
l told you he´d come to his senses.

1581
01:37:46,038 --> 01:37:48,836
-Was he here too?
-Sure.

1582
01:37:48,908 --> 01:37:51,502
Good golly.
Why didn´t you sell tickets?

1583
01:38:05,124 --> 01:38:06,614
Say something, Dext.

1584
01:38:08,127 --> 01:38:09,560
Say anything.

1585
01:38:11,731 --> 01:38:14,928
-No, you do.
-Oh, Dext!

1586
01:38:15,001 --> 01:38:17,629
l´m such an unholy mess of a girl.

1587
01:38:19,138 --> 01:38:21,299
That´s no good.
That´s not even conversation.

1588
01:38:23,142 --> 01:38:25,804
But never in my life--

1589
01:38:25,878 --> 01:38:28,403
not if l live to be a hundred--

1590
01:38:28,481 --> 01:38:32,247
will l ever forget how you tried
to stand me on my feet again today.

1591
01:38:32,318 --> 01:38:34,309
Oh, you, you´re in great shape.

1592
01:38:36,956 --> 01:38:40,153
Tell me, what did you think
of my wedding present?

1593
01:38:40,226 --> 01:38:42,558
l like my presents
at least acknowledged, you know.

1594
01:38:42,628 --> 01:38:44,061
lt was beautiful.

1595
01:38:45,598 --> 01:38:47,589
And sweet, Dext.

1596
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:52,695
Yes. She was quite a boat,
the True Love, wasn´t she?

1597
01:38:52,772 --> 01:38:55,297
Was and is.

1598
01:38:57,343 --> 01:38:58,901
My, she was yare!

1599
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:02,070
She was yare, all right.

1600
01:39:04,383 --> 01:39:07,045
l wasn´t, was l?

1601
01:39:09,121 --> 01:39:10,383
Not very.

1602
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:13,417
You were good
at the bright work, though.

1603
01:39:13,493 --> 01:39:15,085
l made her shine.

1604
01:39:16,329 --> 01:39:18,354
Where is she now?

1605
01:39:18,431 --> 01:39:20,456
l´m gonna sell her to Rufe Watriss.

1606
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:25,401
You´re going to sell
the True Love for money?

1607
01:39:25,471 --> 01:39:27,962
-Sure.
-To that fat old rum pot?

1608
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,201
Oh, well, what does it matter?

1609
01:39:30,276 --> 01:39:32,267
When you´re through with a boat,
you´re through.

1610
01:39:33,613 --> 01:39:35,945
Besides, it was only comfortable
for two people.

1611
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:38,783
Unless you want her.

1612
01:39:40,286 --> 01:39:42,948
No. No, l don´t want her.

1613
01:39:45,858 --> 01:39:48,053
l´m designing another one anyway...

1614
01:39:48,127 --> 01:39:50,118
along more practical lines.

1615
01:39:50,897 --> 01:39:53,092
What will you call her?

1616
01:39:53,165 --> 01:39:56,100
l thought the True Love ll.
What do you think?

1617
01:39:56,168 --> 01:40:00,229
lf you call any boat that, l promise
l´ll blow you and it out of the water.

1618
01:40:00,306 --> 01:40:02,706
l´ll tell you
what you can call her.

1619
01:40:02,775 --> 01:40:06,370
-What?
-ln fond remembrance of me...

1620
01:40:06,445 --> 01:40:08,640
the Easy Virtue.

1621
01:40:08,714 --> 01:40:11,911
Shut up, Red. l can´t have you thinking
things like that about yourself.

1622
01:40:11,984 --> 01:40:16,478
What am l supposed to think when l--
l don´t know.

1623
01:40:16,556 --> 01:40:18,490
l don´t know anything anymore.

1624
01:40:19,559 --> 01:40:21,925
That sounds very hopeful, Red.

1625
01:40:21,994 --> 01:40:23,393
That sounds just fine.

1626
01:40:25,965 --> 01:40:29,128
We´re almost ready.
Stand up, dear.

1627
01:40:29,201 --> 01:40:32,193
Turn around.
Oh, yes, it´s lovely.

1628
01:40:32,271 --> 01:40:35,297
l´m glad we decided against--
Dexter, you shouldn´t be here--

1629
01:40:35,374 --> 01:40:36,864
against the blue one.

1630
01:40:36,943 --> 01:40:39,411
No games, Dexter.
George will be right over.

1631
01:40:39,478 --> 01:40:42,470
l just telephoned. Here´s a note
he sent you this morning.

1632
01:40:42,548 --> 01:40:45,676
Oh, dear,
doesn´t everything look lovely?

1633
01:40:45,751 --> 01:40:47,480
Dr. Parsons?

1634
01:40:48,888 --> 01:40:51,550
Mr. Kittredge hasn´t arrived yet,
Dr. Parsons.

1635
01:40:51,624 --> 01:40:53,854
Come along. l want you
to meet Tracy´s grandmother.

1636
01:40:53,926 --> 01:40:57,327
Tracy, don´t sit down again
until after the ceremony.

1637
01:40:57,396 --> 01:41:00,524
Dexter, they telephoned from your house
that a Mr. Sidney Kidd was there.

1638
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:04,001
l was to tell you that he´s reading it.
Whatever does that mean?

1639
01:41:06,138 --> 01:41:09,505
l have a feeling it won´t be
so hard for me to resign now.

1640
01:41:09,575 --> 01:41:11,873
And belts will be worn tighter
this winter.

1641
01:41:13,446 --> 01:41:16,381
Well, Red, l´m afraid
it´s the deadline.

1642
01:41:17,617 --> 01:41:19,175
So is this. Listen.

1643
01:41:19,251 --> 01:41:21,879
""My dear Tracy, l want you to know
that you will always be my friend...

1644
01:41:21,954 --> 01:41:25,720
""but your conduct last night was so
shocking to my ideals of womanhood--""

1645
01:41:25,791 --> 01:41:28,851
No, don´t go.
You might as well hear it too.

1646
01:41:28,928 --> 01:41:31,021
""to my ideals of womanhood
that my attitude toward you...

and useful life together...

1648

1650

Hello, George.

1651
01:41:41,941 --> 01:41:44,034
Tracy, all these people.

1652
01:41:46,912 --> 01:41:49,244
lt´s only a letter
from a friend.

1653
01:41:49,315 --> 01:41:51,249
They´re my friends too.

for richer, for poorer,
for better, for worse...

1662
01:42:16,909 --> 01:42:19,309
in sickness and in health and--

1663
01:42:20,579 --> 01:42:24,447
Thank you so very much
for your good wishes at this time.

1664
01:42:24,517 --> 01:42:27,714
-That´s all you have to say?
-What else?

1665
01:42:27,787 --> 01:42:30,620
l wish, for your sake
as well as mine...

1666
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:33,124
l had an explanation, but...

1667
01:42:33,192 --> 01:42:35,956
unfortunately, l have none.

1668
01:42:36,028 --> 01:42:38,258
You´d better just say
good riddance, George.

1669
01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:40,264
-lt isn´t easy.
-l don´t see why.

1670
01:42:41,734 --> 01:42:43,964
-Say something, stupid!
-Just wait a minute.

1671
01:42:44,036 --> 01:42:45,333
What for?

1672
01:42:45,404 --> 01:42:48,430
On the very eve of your wedding,
an affair with another man!

1673
01:42:48,507 --> 01:42:51,738
l told you l agree, and l´ll
tell you again, good riddance to me.

1674
01:42:51,811 --> 01:42:54,871
Tracy, your attitude
is a little difficult to understand.

1675
01:42:54,947 --> 01:42:57,438
-Yes, l can see that it would be.
-Not necessarily.

1676
01:42:57,516 --> 01:43:01,179
-You keep out of this.
-You forget, l am out of it.

1677
01:43:01,253 --> 01:43:04,313
Kittredge, it may
interest you to know...

1678
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:07,086
that this so-called ""affair""
consisted of exactly two kisses...

1679
01:43:07,159 --> 01:43:08,751
and a late swim.

1680
01:43:08,828 --> 01:43:10,659
-Thanks, but--
-Which l enjoyed...

1681
01:43:10,730 --> 01:43:13,528
and the memory of which
l wouldn´t part with for anything.

1682
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:15,624
-lt´s no use, Mike.
-After which...

1683
01:43:15,701 --> 01:43:19,159
l deposited Tracy on her bed
in her room...

1684
01:43:19,238 --> 01:43:21,968
and returned down here to you two,
which doubtless you´ll remember.

1685
01:43:22,041 --> 01:43:24,032
Doubtless without a doubt.

1686
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:26,806
You mean to say
that was all there was to it?

1687
01:43:26,879 --> 01:43:28,210
l do.

1688
01:43:29,882 --> 01:43:34,649
Why? Was l so unattractive,
so distant, so forbidding or something?

1689
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:37,416
-This is fine talk too.
-l´m asking a question.

1690
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:40,618
You were extremely attractive,
and as for distant and forbidding...

1691
01:43:40,693 --> 01:43:43,753
on the contrary, but you also
were a little the worse--

1692
01:43:43,829 --> 01:43:47,492
or better--for wine,
and there are rules about that.

1693
01:43:47,566 --> 01:43:50,729
Thank you, Mike.
l think men are wonderful.

1694
01:43:50,803 --> 01:43:52,532
The little dears.

1695
01:43:52,605 --> 01:43:55,472
l fail to see the humor
in this situation, Miss lmbrie.

1696
01:43:55,541 --> 01:43:58,772
l can appreciate that.
lt was hard for me too at first.

1697
01:43:58,844 --> 01:44:00,869
-Oh, Liz.
-lt´s all right, Tracy.

1698
01:44:00,946 --> 01:44:05,246
We all go haywire at times,
and if we don´t, maybe we ought to.

1699
01:44:06,919 --> 01:44:10,616
You see, it really wasn´t Tracy
at all, Mr. Kittredge.

1700
01:44:10,689 --> 01:44:14,853
lt was another girl.
A Miss Pommery, 1926.

1701
01:44:14,927 --> 01:44:17,919
You´d had too much to drink, Tracy.

1702
01:44:17,997 --> 01:44:21,228
That seems to be
the consensus of opinion.

1703
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:24,599
Will you promise me
never to touch the stuff again?

1704
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:28,470
No, George.
l don´t believe l will.

1705
01:44:28,541 --> 01:44:30,634
There are certain things
about that other girl...

1706
01:44:30,709 --> 01:44:33,678
that...Miss Pommery ´26,
l rather like.

1707
01:44:33,746 --> 01:44:36,476
-But a man expects his wife--
-To behave herself. Naturally.

1708
01:44:36,549 --> 01:44:38,483
To behave herself naturally.

1709
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:41,950
Sorry.

1710
01:44:43,589 --> 01:44:47,719
lf it hadn´t been for that drink last
night, all this might not have happened.

1711
01:44:47,793 --> 01:44:50,227
Apparently nothing did.

1712
01:44:50,296 --> 01:44:52,264
What made you think it had?

1713
01:44:52,331 --> 01:44:54,526
Well, it didn´t take
much imagination.

1714
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:57,933
Not much, perhaps,
but just of a certain kind.

1715
01:44:58,003 --> 01:45:00,096
lt seems you didn´t think
anything too well of yourself.

1716
01:45:00,172 --> 01:45:01,799
That´s the odd thing.

1717
01:45:01,874 --> 01:45:05,310
Somehow l´d have hoped that you´d
think better of me than l did.

1718
01:45:05,377 --> 01:45:08,039
l´m not going to quibble.
All the evidence was there.

1719
01:45:08,113 --> 01:45:11,173
And l was guilty straight off
until l was proved innocent.

1720
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:13,275
Downright un-American,
if you ask me.

1721
01:45:13,352 --> 01:45:15,786
Nobody is asking you.

1722
01:45:15,855 --> 01:45:17,846
You forgot your hat, Miss Tracy.

1723
01:45:17,923 --> 01:45:21,381
You look lovely, Miss Tracy.
All our very best wishes.

1724
01:45:23,429 --> 01:45:27,024
Dexter, l wish you´d let me know when
you invite people to Tracy´s weddings.

1725
01:45:27,099 --> 01:45:29,329
-What happened, darling?
-A Mr. Sidney Kidd is here.

1726
01:45:29,401 --> 01:45:31,426
He says he knows you.

1727
01:45:31,503 --> 01:45:33,801
Sidney Kidd is here himself?

1728
01:45:33,873 --> 01:45:36,034
What else did Mr. Sidney Kidd
have to say?

1729
01:45:36,108 --> 01:45:40,306
He sent you the strangest message.
He said, ""Tell Haven he wins.""

1730
01:45:40,379 --> 01:45:43,542
""Tell him l´m licked.""
Wins what, Dexter?

1731
01:45:46,385 --> 01:45:50,412
Mr. Sidney Kidd´s presence here makes
the marriage of national importance.

1732
01:45:50,489 --> 01:45:52,957
l think it´s extremely kind
and thoughtful of him.

1733
01:45:56,095 --> 01:45:59,223
Come on, Tracy, it must be late.
Let´s let bygones be bygones.

1734
01:45:59,298 --> 01:46:01,163
What do you say?

1735
01:46:01,233 --> 01:46:04,327
Yes, and good-bye, George.

1736
01:46:05,971 --> 01:46:07,962
-l don´t understand you.
-Please, good-bye.

1737
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:09,974
-Look here--
-You´re too good for me.

1738
01:46:10,042 --> 01:46:12,033
-You´re a hundred times too good.
-But l never said--

1739
01:46:12,111 --> 01:46:14,545
l´d make you most unhappy. Most.

1740
01:46:15,614 --> 01:46:17,707
That is, l´d do my best to.

1741
01:46:18,784 --> 01:46:21,651
Well, if that´s
the way you want it.

1742
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,711
That´s the way it is.

1743
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:27,654
All right.
Possibly it´s just as well.

1744
01:46:27,726 --> 01:46:30,058
Yes, l thought you´d finally
come to that conclusion.

1745
01:46:32,164 --> 01:46:34,860
l have a feeling you had more
to do with this than anyone.

1746
01:46:34,934 --> 01:46:39,030
-Possibly, but you were a great help.
-You and your whole rotten class.

1747
01:46:39,104 --> 01:46:40,969
Class, my eye.

1748
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,907
You´re on your way out,
the lot of you, and good riddance!

1749
01:46:46,278 --> 01:46:48,473
There goes George.

1750
01:46:56,288 --> 01:46:58,950
Oh, my sainted aunt!

1751
01:47:09,868 --> 01:47:12,996
-That welter of faces.
-Oh, my, they look solemn.

1752
01:47:13,072 --> 01:47:14,903
What am l to do?

1753
01:47:14,974 --> 01:47:16,407
-Tracy?
-Yes, Mike?

1754
01:47:16,475 --> 01:47:19,239
Parson Parsons has never seen
Kittredge before, has he?

1755
01:47:19,311 --> 01:47:23,008
l got you into this thing,
and l´ll get you out of it.

1756
01:47:23,082 --> 01:47:25,073
Will you marry me, Tracy?

1757
01:47:31,256 --> 01:47:32,553
No, Mike.

1758
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:37,857
Thanks, but hmm-mm. Nope.

1759
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:39,898
l´ve never asked a girl
to marry me.

1760
01:47:39,965 --> 01:47:41,523
l´ve avoided it.

1761
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,966
But you´ve got me
all confused now.

1762
01:47:44,036 --> 01:47:45,401
Why not?

1763
01:47:46,705 --> 01:47:49,139
Because l don´t think Liz
would like it...

1764
01:47:50,509 --> 01:47:53,069
and l´m not sure you would...

1765
01:47:53,145 --> 01:47:56,808
and l´m even a little doubtful
about myself.

1766
01:47:57,883 --> 01:48:00,613
But l am beholden to you, Mike.

1767
01:48:00,686 --> 01:48:03,018
l´m most beholden.

1768
01:48:04,256 --> 01:48:06,520
But they´re in there.
They´re waiting.

1769
01:48:06,592 --> 01:48:10,187
Don´t get too conventional all at once,
will ya? There´ll be a reaction.

1770
01:48:12,598 --> 01:48:16,728
Cheer up. lt´ll be all right.
You´ve been got out of jams before.

1771
01:48:16,802 --> 01:48:18,793
-Been got out of them?
-Certainly.

1772
01:48:18,871 --> 01:48:21,362
Don´t worry.
You always have been.

1773
01:48:24,410 --> 01:48:26,537
We´ve seen George.
lt´s all right, dear.

1774
01:48:26,612 --> 01:48:28,603
Your father will make
a very simple announcement.

1775
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:31,547
ls there anything special
you want me to say, Tracy?

1776
01:48:31,617 --> 01:48:35,144
Uh, no, no.
l´ll say it.

1777
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:39,156
Whatever it is, l´ll say it. l won´t
be got out of anything anymore, thanks.

1778
01:48:48,233 --> 01:48:50,224
Hello.

1779
01:48:50,302 --> 01:48:53,328
Good morning. l--
Stop that music.

1780
01:48:54,673 --> 01:48:56,868
l´m sorry to have kept you waiting...

1781
01:48:56,942 --> 01:49:01,879
but there´s been a slight hitch
in the proceedings.

1782
01:49:01,947 --> 01:49:06,043
l´ve made a terrible fool of myself,
which isn´t unusual...

1783
01:49:06,118 --> 01:49:10,452
and my fiancé--
my fiancé that was, that is--

1784
01:49:10,522 --> 01:49:15,186
he thinks we´d better call it a day,
and l quite agree with him.

1785
01:49:16,095 --> 01:49:17,824
Peace is wonderful.

1786
01:49:17,896 --> 01:49:21,195
Uh, bec--uh--
Dexter, what next?

1787
01:49:21,266 --> 01:49:24,531
Three years ago l did you out of
a wedding in this house by eloping.

1788
01:49:24,603 --> 01:49:29,438
-Two years ago, you were invited--
-My dear, just a loan.

1789
01:49:29,508 --> 01:49:31,533
-Put this in your vest pocket.
-Don´t have a vest.

1790
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:33,601
Then hold it in your hand.

1791
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,273
-Which was very bad manners.
-Which was very bad manners.

1792
01:49:36,348 --> 01:49:39,511
l´ll make it up to you by going through
with it now as originally planned.

1793
01:49:39,585 --> 01:49:41,576
l´ll make it up to you by--

1794
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:48,683
by going beautifully through
with it now...

1795
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,457
as originally and
most beautifully planned.

1796
01:49:52,531 --> 01:49:55,830
-So if you´ll just keep your seats--
-So if you´ll just keep your seats--

1797
01:49:55,901 --> 01:49:58,927
-That´s all.
-Um, that´s all.

1798
01:49:59,004 --> 01:50:01,302
-Are you sure?
-No, but l´ll risk it. Will you?

1799
01:50:01,373 --> 01:50:05,400
You bet. You didn´t do it to soften
the blow? Nor to save my face?

1800
01:50:05,477 --> 01:50:07,536
-No, it´s a nice face.
-l´ll be yare now.

1801
01:50:07,613 --> 01:50:10,912
-l´ll promise to be yare.
-Be whatever you like. You all set?

1802
01:50:10,983 --> 01:50:12,746
-All set.
-Best man?

1803
01:50:12,818 --> 01:50:14,649
Honored, C.K.

1804
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:16,779
-Maid of honor?
-Matron of honor.

1805
01:50:16,855 --> 01:50:18,379
Remember Joe Smith.

1806
01:50:18,457 --> 01:50:20,391
How did this ever happen?

1807
01:50:21,627 --> 01:50:23,618
You´d better tell Mr. Dutton
to start the music.

all this before in another life.
