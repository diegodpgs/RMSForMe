1
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:35,313
Echo Three to Echo Seven.

2
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,440
Han, old buddy,
do you read me?

3
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:39,614
<i>Loud and clear, kid.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

4
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:42,412
I finished my circle.
I don't pick up any life readings.

5
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:45,455
<i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube</i>
<i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>

6
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,373
<i>The sensors are placed.</i>
<i>I'm going back.</i>

7
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,374
Right. I'll see you shortly.

8
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:51,579
There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here.

9
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:53,920
I want to check it out.
It won't take long.

10
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,080
Steady.

11
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,760
Steady, girl. What's the matter?
You smell something?

12
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:42,756
Chewie. Chewie?

13
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,976
All right.
Don't lose your temper.

14
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:53,514
I'll come right back
and give you a hand.

15
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:15,160
Solo.

16
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:18,048
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.

17
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:21,145
- You'll know if anything comes around.
- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

18
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,881
No. He's checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

19
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:27,513
With all the meteor activity, it's gonna
be difficult to spot approaching ships.

20
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:29,552
General, I gotta leave.
I can't stay any more.

21
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:32,521
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- There's a price on my head.

22
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:34,973
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,
I'm a dead man.

23
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,948
A death mark's not
an easy thing to live with.

24
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:41,018
You're a good fighter, Solo.
I hate to lose you.

25
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,567
Thank you, General.

26
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:52,664
Well, Your Highness,
guess this is it.

27
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:54,658
That's right.

28
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:59,920
Don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

29
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:04,126
Han.

30
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:09,009
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- I thought you had decided to stay.

31
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:11,977
The bounty hunter we ran into
in Ord Mantell changed my mind.

32
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:14,345
Han, we need you.

33
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,557
- We need?
- Yes.

34
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:19,147
- What about you need?
- I need?

35
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:21,733
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:25,363
- You probably don't.
- What precisely am I supposed to know?

37
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:28,943
Come on. You want me to stay because
of the way you feel about me.

38
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,652
Yes. You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader.

39
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,328
No. That's not it.

40
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,084
Come on.

41
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,371
- Come on.
- You're imagining things.

42
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,415
Am I?
Then why are you following me?

43
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,756
Afraid I'd leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

44
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:46,459
- I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
- I can arrange that.

45
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:48,719
You could use a good kiss!

46
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:52,471
Don't blame me. I didn't ask you
to turn on the thermal heater.

47
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:56,018
I merely commented that it was freezing
in the princess's chamber.

48
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:57,974
It's supposed to be freezing.

49
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,516
How we're going to dry
her clothes I really don't know.

50
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:01,850
Oh, switch off!

51
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:05,071
Why did you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here.

52
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:07,321
- Excuse me.
- Put them back together right now.

53
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:09,490
- Might I have a word?
- What do you want?

54
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:12,110
Princess Leia's been trying
to get you on the communicator.

55
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:14,405
I turned it off.
I don't want to talk to her.

56
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,412
Princess Leia is wondering about
Master Luke. He hasn't come back.

57
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:19,862
- She doesn't know where he is.
- I don't know where he is.

58
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:22,709
- Nobody knows where he is.
- What do you mean, nobody knows?

59
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,121
Deck Officer.

60
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,750
- Deck Officer.
- Excuse me, sir. Might l...

61
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:28,630
Do you know where
Commander Skywalker is?

62
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:31,433
I haven't seen him. It's possible
he came in the south entrance.

63
00:07:31,558 --> 00:07:33,764
It's possible?
Why don't you go find out?

64
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:36,432
- It's getting dark out there.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:38,935
Excuse me, sir.
Might I enquire what's going on?

66
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,354
- Why not?
- Impossible man.

67
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:43,477
Come along, R2.
Let's find Princess Leia.

68
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:46,648
Between ourselves, I think
Master Luke is in considerable danger.

69
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,451
Commander Skywalker
hasn't come in the south entrance.

70
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:01,188
- Maybe he forgot to check in.
- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

71
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:03,347
Not yet. We're having trouble
adapting them to the cold.

72
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:06,435
- We'll have to go out on tauntauns.
- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.

73
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:08,507
That's right,
and my friend's out in it.

74
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:15,764
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

75
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:17,934
Then I'll see you in hell.

76
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,658
You must come along now, R2.

77
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:39,825
There's really
nothing more we can do.

78
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:42,031
And my joints are freezing up.

79
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:47,039
Don't say things like that.
Of course we'll see Master Luke again.

80
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,922
And he'll be quite all right.
You'll see.

81
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:53,666
Stupid little short circuit.
He'll be quite all right.

82
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:54,111
Sir, all the patrols are in.
Still no...

83
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:58,199
Still no contact
from Skywalker or Solo.

84
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:02,405
Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

85
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:05,906
although he admits that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

86
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,197
Your Highness,
there's nothing more we can do tonight.

87
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,618
The shield doors must be closed.

88
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:14,371
- Close the doors.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:20,629
R2 says the chances
of survival are 725-to-1.

90
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:35,934
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

91
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,649
from time to time.

92
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:42,611
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

93
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,202
Don't worry about Master Luke.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

94
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,120
He's quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

95
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:08,929
<i>Luke.</i>

96
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:12,101
Luke.

97
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:21,157
Ben?

98
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:23,904
You will go to
the Dagobah system.

99
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,779
Dagobah system?

100
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:29,364
There you will
learn from Yoda...

101
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:33,248
the Jedi master
who instructed me.

102
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,099
Don't do this, Luke.
Give me a sign here.

103
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,129
- Not much time.
- Ben.

104
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,766
Hang on, kid.

105
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,142
Dagobah system. Dagobah.

106
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:34,931
This may smell bad, kid...

107
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,225
Yoda.

108
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,821
But it'll keep you warm
till I get the shelter up.

109
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,987
Ben. Dagobah.

110
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:50,905
I thought they smelled bad...

111
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,866
on the outside.

112
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,617
Echo Base, I've got something.

113
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:40,663
Not much,
but it could be a life form.

114
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:47,544
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

115
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,553
This is Rogue Two.

116
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:52,351
This is Rogue Two.

117
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:55,311
Captain Solo, do you copy?

118
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,477
Commander Skywalker,
do you copy?

119
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:06,440
This is Rogue Two.

120
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:09,657
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

121
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:13,655
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.

122
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,362
I've found them.
Repeat. I've found them.

123
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,533
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

124
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:53,155
- Thanks, 3PO.
- R2 expresses his relief also.

125
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:56,786
How ya feelin', kid?
You don't look so bad to me.

126
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,786
You look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

127
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,702
- Thanks to you.
- That's two you owe me, junior.

128
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,167
Well, Your Worship...

129
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:08,383
looks like you managed to keep me around
for a little while longer.

130
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,384
I had nothing to do with it.

131
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:13,133
General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave...

132
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,174
until we've activated the energy field.

133
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:16,553
That's a good story.

134
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:20,599
I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

135
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:24,016
I don't know where
you get your delusions, laser brain.

136
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:29,694
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

137
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:32,907
but you didn't see us alone
in the south passage.

138
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,276
She expressed
her true feelings for me.

139
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:36,527
My...

140
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:40,079
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

141
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,248
scruffy-looking nerf herder!

142
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,419
Who's scruffy-lookin'

143
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,169
I must have hit close to the mark
to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?

144
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,761
I guess you don't know
everything about women yet.

145
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:07,694
<i>Headquarters personnel,</i>
<i>report to command centre.</i>

146
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:13,573
<i>Headquarters personnel,</i>
<i>report to command centre.</i>

147
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,657
Take it easy.

148
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:17,825
Excuse us, please.

149
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:22,163
Princess, we have a visitor.

150
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,205
We picked up something
outside Zone 12 moving east.

151
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,580
- It's metal.
- It couldn't be one of those creatures.

152
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:32,499
- Could be one of our speeders.
- No. Wait.

153
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:35,257
There's something
very weak coming through.

154
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,636
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.

155
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,890
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an imperial code.

156
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,944
It isn't friendly.
Chewie, let's check it out.

157
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:56,074
Send Rogues 10 and 11
to Station 38.

158
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,454
- <i>I'm afraid there's not much left.</i>
- What was it?

159
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,487
<i>Droid of some kind.</i>
<i>I didn't hit it that hard.</i>

160
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:40,068
- <i>Must have had a self-destruct.</i>
- An imperial probe droid.

161
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:43,074
<i>It's a good bet the Empire</i>
<i>knows we're here.</i>

162
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:45,417
We'd better start the evacuation.

163
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,911
- Admiral.
- Yes, Captain?

164
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:37,211
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

165
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:40,224
from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

166
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:43,431
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.

167
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:46,512
- I want proof, not leads.
- The visuals indicate life readings.

168
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,887
It could mean anything.
If we followed up every lead...

169
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:52,059
But, sir, the Hoth system is
supposed to be devoid of humans forms.

170
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,559
- You found something?
- Yes, my lord.

171
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,319
That's it.
The rebels are there.

172
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:03,902
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

173
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:06,789
- It could be smugglers...
- That is the system.

174
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:09,287
And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.

175
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:12,418
Set your course
for the Hoth system.

176
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:14,953
General Veers,
prepare your men.

177
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,418
Admiral.

178
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,398
Groups Seven and 10
will stay behind to fly the speeders.

179
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:27,260
As soon as each transport is loaded...

180
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,394
evacuation control
will give clearance for launch.

181
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:31,223
Right, sir.

182
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,439
All right. That's it.

183
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:36,980
Try it.

184
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,485
Turn it off! Turn it off!

185
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,279
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47 s.

186
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:51,032
Forget the heavy equipment. There's time
to get small modules on the transports.

187
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:53,207
- Take care, sir.
- Thanks.

188
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:59,751
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

189
00:22:03,513 --> 00:22:05,138
Okay, okay.

190
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,059
Hi, kid.

191
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:11,269
There's gotta be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

192
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,807
Wait a second.

193
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,306
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

194
00:22:22,532 --> 00:22:24,691
Be careful.

195
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,653
You too.

196
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:34,666
General, there's
a fleet of Stardestroyers...

197
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:37,036
coming out of hyperspace
in Sector Four.

198
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:40,126
Reroute all power
to the energy shield.

199
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,343
We gotta hold them till
all transports are away.

200
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,510
Prepare for ground assault.

201
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:02,736
- What is it, General?
- The fleet has moved out of light speed.

202
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:04,940
ComScan has detected
an energy field...

203
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:07,648
protecting an area of the sixth planet
of the Hoth system.

204
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,242
The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

205
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:12,827
The rebels are alerted
to our presence.

206
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,042
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

207
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:18,411
He felt surprise was wiser.

208
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,623
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

209
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:24,340
General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

210
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,094
Yes, my lord.

211
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,176
<i>Lord Vader.</i>

212
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,313
<i>The fleet has moved out of light speed,</i>
<i>and we're preparing to...</i>

213
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,528
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

214
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,026
- Captain Piett.
- <i>Yes, my lord?</i>

215
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,158
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

216
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:51,239
and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

217
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:54,538
You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

218
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,493
<i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

219
00:23:58,086 --> 00:24:01,171
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

220
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,967
The heavy transport ships
will leave as soon as they're loaded.

221
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,132
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

222
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:09,345
The energy shield
can only be opened for a short time...

223
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:11,964
so you'll have to stay very close
to your transports.

224
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,176
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?

225
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:16,350
The ion cannon will fire
several shots...

226
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,599
to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

227
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:21,809
When you've gotten past
the energy shield...

228
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:23,983
proceed directly
to the rendezvous point.

229
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:26,021
Understood?

230
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:27,734
Good luck.

231
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,322
Everybody to your stations.
Let's go.

232
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:50,553
Their primary target will be
the power generators.

233
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,507
Prepare to open shield.

234
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:00,513
Sir, rebel ships are
coming into our sector.

235
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:02,725
Good. Our first catch of the day.

236
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:06,817
Stand by, ion control.

237
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:08,906
Fire.

238
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:27,209
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

239
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:30,094
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

240
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,475
Feeling all right, sir?

241
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,477
Just like new, Dak.
How about you?

242
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,523
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

243
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,690
I know what you mean.

244
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:07,331
Echo Station 3-T8.
We've spotted imperial walkers.

245
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,921
<i>Imperial walkers</i>
<i>on the north ridge.</i>

246
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:34,321
Echo Station 57,
we're on our way.

247
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:41,741
All right, boys,
keep tight now.

248
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,998
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

249
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:45,586
Steady, Dak.

250
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:47,539
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

251
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,967
I'm coming in.

252
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:58,556
Hobbie, you still with me?

253
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,412
That armour's too strong for blasters.

254
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,036
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

255
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:30,330
Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance.

256
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:33,963
Stand by, Dak.

257
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:36,881
Luke, we've got
a malfunction in fire control.

258
00:27:37,014 --> 00:27:39,006
I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.

259
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:41,014
Just hang on.

260
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:43,930
Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

261
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,359
Dak?

262
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:17,385
Yes, Lord Vader.
I've reached the main power generators.

263
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:20,597
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

264
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:26,766
Rogue Three.

265
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:28,308
Copy, Rogue Leader.

266
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,394
<i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.</i>
<i>You'll have to make this shot.</i>

267
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,234
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

268
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:35,687
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

269
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,858
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

270
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:43,204
Steady, Rogue Two.

271
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:45,237
Activate harpoon.

272
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:49,746
Good shot, Janson.

273
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,089
One more pass.

274
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:05,925
Cable out.
Let her go!

275
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:07,259
Detach cable.

276
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:09,136
Cable detached.

277
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:18,900
Come on!

278
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,071
- That got him!
- I see it, Wedge. Good work.

279
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:31,740
I don't think we can protect
two transports at a time.

280
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,084
It's risky, but we can't
hold out much longer.

281
00:29:34,214 --> 00:29:35,839
We have no choice.

282
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,469
- Launch patrol.
- Evacuate remaining ground staff.

283
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,884
This one goes there,
that one goes there. Right?

284
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,471
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

285
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:55,439
And do take good care of yourself.

286
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:00,650
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

287
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:26,798
All troops will debark
for ground assault.

288
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:29,389
Prepare to target
the main generator.

289
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:36,516
- Rogue Two, are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

290
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,478
Set harpoon.
I'll cover for you.

291
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,989
- Coming around.
- Watch that crossfire, boys.

292
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,242
Set for position three.

293
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,650
Steady.

294
00:30:47,788 --> 00:30:50,279
Stay tight and low.
This is it!

295
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,416
Hobbie!

296
00:30:57,547 --> 00:30:59,006
I've been hit!

297
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:44,428
- You all right?
- Why are you still here?

298
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:47,627
- Heard the command centre had been hit.
- You've got your clearance to leave.

299
00:31:47,727 --> 00:31:51,097
Don't worry. I'll leave.
First I'm gonna get you to your ship.

300
00:31:51,226 --> 00:31:54,310
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It's our only hope.

301
00:31:54,438 --> 00:31:57,522
Send all troops in Sector 12 to
the south slope to protect the fighters.

302
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:01,232
<i>Imperial troops</i>
<i>have entered the base.</i>

303
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:02,986
<i>Imperial troops have entered...</i>

304
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:04,987
Come on. That's it.

305
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:07,440
Give the evacuation code signal.

306
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:11,409
And get to your transports.

307
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:12,944
Wait for me.

308
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:14,528
Begin retreat!

309
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:17,160
Fall back!

310
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:18,185
- Distance to power generators?
- 17.28.

311
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:29,231
Target. Maximum firepower.

312
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,174
Transport, this is Solo.
Take off. I can't get to you.

313
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:00,221
I'll get her out on the <i>Falcon.</i>
Come on.

314
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:04,897
Where are you going?
Come back!

315
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,789
Wait! Wait for me! Stop!

316
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:28,750
- How typical.
- Come on.

317
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,597
Hurry up, goldenrod!
You're gonna be a permanent resident.

318
00:34:35,724 --> 00:34:37,467
Wait! Wait!

319
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,577
- How's this?
- Would it help if I got out and pushed?

320
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:00,912
- Captain Solo. Captain Solo.
- It might.

321
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:04,878
Sir, might I suggest that you...

322
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,663
It can wait.

323
00:35:10,926 --> 00:35:13,417
This bucket of bolts
will never get past that blockade.

324
00:35:13,553 --> 00:35:15,593
This baby's got
a few surprises left in her.

325
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,564
Come on! Come on!

326
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:29,646
Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

327
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:32,651
See?

328
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:34,778
Someday you'll be wrong.
I hope I'm there to see it.

329
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:38,775
Punch it!

330
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:57,888
R2.

331
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,597
Get her ready for take-off.

332
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,054
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

333
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:11,982
Don't worry, R2.
We're going. We're going.

334
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:27,707
There's nothing wrong, R2.
I'm just setting a new course.

335
00:36:31,173 --> 00:36:35,336
We're not gonna regroup with the others.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

336
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:39,180
Yes, R2.

337
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,054
That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

338
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,159
- I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
- Saw what?

339
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,448
Stardestroyers,
two of 'em coming right at us.

340
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,370
- Sir, might I suggest...
- Shut him up or shut him down!

341
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:13,211
Check the deflector shield.

342
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:17,298
Great. Well, we can still
outmanoeuvre them.

343
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,597
Take evasive action!

344
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,940
- Prepare to jump to light speed.
- But, sir!

345
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:40,657
They're getting closer.

346
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:42,907
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

347
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,664
Watch what?

348
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:51,706
- I think we're in trouble.
- If I may say so...

349
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:54,292
I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.

350
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:57,507
- It's impossible to go to light speed.
- We're in trouble.

351
00:38:01,805 --> 00:38:03,050
Horizontal boosters!

352
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:07,259
Alluvial dampers.

353
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:12,774
That's not it.
Bring me the hydrospanner.

354
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:18,947
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.

355
00:38:21,658 --> 00:38:22,856
Chewie!

356
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,578
That wasn't a laser blast.
Something hit us.

357
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,118
Han, get up here.

358
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,287
Come on, Chewie!

359
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:35,129
Asteroids.

360
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:41,666
- Chewie, set 271.
- What are you doing?

361
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,386
You're not actually going
into an asteroid field?

362
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:47,275
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

363
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:52,388
You don't have to do this
to impress me.

364
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:55,689
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field...

365
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:59,067
- is approximately 3,720-to-1.
- Never tell me the odds.

366
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:30,177
You said you wanted to be around when
I made a mistake. This could be it.

367
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,935
I take it back.

368
00:39:32,062 --> 00:39:35,146
We're gonna get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

369
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,033
- Ain't gonna argue with that.
- Pulverized?

370
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:39,019
I'm going closer
to one of the big ones.

371
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:40,979
- Closer?
- Closer?

372
00:40:08,098 --> 00:40:09,972
This is suicide!
There's nowhere to go.

373
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,057
There. That looks pretty good.

374
00:40:12,185 --> 00:40:14,059
What looks pretty good?

375
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:16,560
Yeah. That'll do nicely.

376
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,525
Excuse me, ma'am,
but where are we going?

377
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,701
I hope you know
what you're doing.

378
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,241
Yeah. Me too.

379
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:44,290
Yep, that's it. Dagobah.

380
00:40:46,762 --> 00:40:48,968
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind about this.

381
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:52,387
I'm not picking up
any cities or technology.

382
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,557
Massive life form readings though.

383
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:57,685
There's something alive down there.

384
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,228
Yes. I'm sure
it's perfectly safe for droids.

385
00:41:09,951 --> 00:41:11,659
I know! I know!

386
00:41:11,787 --> 00:41:14,456
All the scopes are dead.
I can't see a thing.

387
00:41:14,581 --> 00:41:17,617
Just hang on.
I'm gonna start the landing cycle.

388
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,385
No, R2, you stay put.
I'll have a look around.

389
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:20,093
R2?

390
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,182
Where are you?

391
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:30,144
R2!

392
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,581
You be more careful.

393
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:44,414
R2, that way.

394
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:13,819
R2!

395
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:42,972
Oh, no.

396
00:43:44,231 --> 00:43:46,270
Are you all right?
Come on.

397
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,859
You were lucky
to get out of there.

398
00:43:53,115 --> 00:43:54,906
Anything broken?

399
00:43:57,661 --> 00:44:00,745
If you're saying
coming here was a bad idea...

400
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:03,031
I'm beginning to agree with ya.

401
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,836
R2, what are we doing here?

402
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:07,372
It's like...

403
00:44:08,463 --> 00:44:10,503
something out of a dream or...

404
00:44:11,466 --> 00:44:13,506
I don't know.

405
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:15,675
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

406
00:44:48,045 --> 00:44:49,420
Yes, Admiral?

407
00:44:49,546 --> 00:44:51,802
Our ships have sighted
the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> lord...

408
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:54,841
but it has entered an asteroid field,
and we cannot risk...

409
00:44:54,968 --> 00:44:57,755
Asteroids do not
concern me, Admiral.

410
00:44:57,888 --> 00:45:01,422
- I want that ship, not excuses.
- Yes, lord.

411
00:45:07,564 --> 00:45:10,648
I'm gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

412
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:14,725
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does
that include shutting me down too?

413
00:45:14,863 --> 00:45:16,903
No. I need you
to talk to the <i>Falcon...</i>

414
00:45:17,032 --> 00:45:19,274
find out what's wrong
with the hyperdrive.

415
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:30,625
Sir, it's quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

416
00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:32,628
Not entirely stable?

417
00:45:32,756 --> 00:45:34,795
I'm glad you're here
to tell us these things.

418
00:45:34,925 --> 00:45:38,507
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

419
00:45:38,637 --> 00:45:41,128
Sometimes I just don't
understand human behaviour.

420
00:45:41,264 --> 00:45:43,590
After all, I'm only
trying to do my job.

421
00:45:48,689 --> 00:45:50,099
Let go.

422
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:54,231
- Let go, please.
- Don't get excited.

423
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:58,061
Captain, being held by you
isn't quite enough to get me excited.

424
00:45:58,198 --> 00:46:00,025
Sorry, sweetheart.

425
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:02,828
I haven't got time
for anything else.

426
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:40,695
Ready for some power?
Okay.

427
00:46:44,703 --> 00:46:46,114
Let's see now.

428
00:46:46,246 --> 00:46:48,535
Put that in there.
There you go.

429
00:46:51,668 --> 00:46:54,420
Now all I gotta do
is find this Yoda...

430
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:56,835
if he even exists.

431
00:47:02,346 --> 00:47:05,263
It's really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

432
00:47:06,725 --> 00:47:08,552
This place gives me the creeps.

433
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:13,891
Still...

434
00:47:15,192 --> 00:47:17,184
there's something familiar
about this place.

435
00:47:19,446 --> 00:47:21,237
I don't know.

436
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:23,404
- I feel like...
- Feel like what?

437
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:26,117
Like we're being watched.

438
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:29,245
Away put your weapon.
I mean you no harm.

439
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:33,168
I am wondering,
why are you here?

440
00:47:34,878 --> 00:47:37,879
- I'm looking for someone.
- Looking?

441
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:41,216
Found someone you have,
I would say.

442
00:47:41,843 --> 00:47:43,386
Right.

443
00:47:44,346 --> 00:47:46,718
Help you I can. Yes.

444
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,797
I don't think so.

445
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:53,140
I'm looking for a great warrior.

446
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:54,896
Great warrior.

447
00:47:57,984 --> 00:48:00,226
Wars not make one great.

448
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,328
Put that down.

449
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:12,364
Hey! That's my dinner.

450
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:18,415
How you get so big
eating food of this kind?

451
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:20,753
Listen, friend, we didn't mean
to land in that puddle.

452
00:48:20,882 --> 00:48:23,420
If we could get our ship out, we would.
But we can't.

453
00:48:23,552 --> 00:48:25,628
Aw, cannot get your ship out.

454
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:27,422
Get out of there.

455
00:48:30,684 --> 00:48:32,973
Hey, you could have broken this.

456
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:36,644
Don't do that.

457
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:47,780
You're making a mess.

458
00:48:49,286 --> 00:48:51,325
Hey, give me that.

459
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,993
Mine, or I will help you not.

460
00:48:54,124 --> 00:48:56,117
I don't want your help.
I want my lamp back.

461
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:59,003
I'm gonna need it to get out of
this slimy mud-hole.

462
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:01,252
Mud-hole? Slimy?
My home this is.

463
00:49:05,135 --> 00:49:06,546
R2, let him have it.

464
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:11,969
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- R2.

465
00:49:15,896 --> 00:49:19,265
Will you move along, little fella?
We got a lot of work to do.

466
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:23,562
Stay and help you I will.
Find your friend.

467
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:27,317
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi master.

468
00:49:29,451 --> 00:49:31,823
Jedi master. Yoda.

469
00:49:31,953 --> 00:49:34,527
- You seek Yoda.
- You know him?

470
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,372
Take you to him I will.

471
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:42,748
Yes, yes, but now we must eat.

472
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:45,550
Come.
Good food. Come.

473
00:49:55,352 --> 00:49:56,976
Come, come.

474
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:00,268
R2...

475
00:50:01,149 --> 00:50:03,391
stay and watch after the camp.

476
00:50:16,957 --> 00:50:18,996
Where is R2 when I need him?

477
00:50:19,126 --> 00:50:21,795
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate...

478
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,829
but it has the most peculiar dialect.

479
00:50:23,964 --> 00:50:27,463
I believe it says the power coupling
on the negative axis has been polarized.

480
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:30,048
I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.

481
00:50:31,138 --> 00:50:33,379
Well, of course
I'll have to replace it.

482
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:36,848
Here. And, Chewie...

483
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,189
I think we better replace
the negative power coupling.

484
00:51:03,587 --> 00:51:06,256
Hey, Your Worship,
I'm only trying to help.

485
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:08,837
Would you please
stop calling me that?

486
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:10,924
Sure, Leia.

487
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:14,468
- You make it so difficult sometimes.
- I do. I really do.

488
00:51:15,557 --> 00:51:17,799
You could be a little nicer though.

489
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:20,604
Admit it.
Sometimes you think I'm all right.

490
00:51:22,981 --> 00:51:25,223
Occasionally, maybe...

491
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,814
when you aren't acting
like a scoundrel.

492
00:51:27,944 --> 00:51:29,355
Scoundrel?

493
00:51:33,325 --> 00:51:35,033
I like the sound of that.

494
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:38,906
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

495
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:41,197
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

496
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,491
My hands are dirty too.
What are you afraid of?

497
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:45,750
- Afraid?
- You're trembling.

498
00:51:46,713 --> 00:51:48,789
I'm not trembling.

499
00:51:50,258 --> 00:51:52,714
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.

500
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:55,252
There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

501
00:51:55,389 --> 00:51:57,428
I happen to like nice men.

502
00:51:57,557 --> 00:52:00,227
- I'm a nice man.
- No, you're not.

503
00:52:03,146 --> 00:52:04,146
Sir, sir!

504
00:52:04,272 --> 00:52:07,143
I've isolated
the reverse power flux coupling.

505
00:52:09,403 --> 00:52:10,601
Thank you.

506
00:52:10,737 --> 00:52:13,691
- Thank you very much.
- You're perfectly welcome, sir.

507
00:52:19,788 --> 00:52:22,908
<i>That, Lord Vader, was the last time</i>
<i>they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

508
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:25,959
<i>Considering the damage we've sustained,</i>
<i>they must have been destroyed.</i>

509
00:52:26,086 --> 00:52:29,371
No, Captain, they're alive.

510
00:52:29,506 --> 00:52:33,835
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

511
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:41,675
- Lord Vader.
- Yes, Admiral. What is it?

512
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,052
The emperor commands you
to make contact with him.

513
00:52:44,187 --> 00:52:46,346
Move the ship out of
the asteroid field...

514
00:52:46,481 --> 00:52:48,723
so that we can send
a clear transmission.

515
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:50,483
Yes, my lord.

516
00:53:07,085 --> 00:53:09,623
What is thy bidding, my master?

517
00:53:10,922 --> 00:53:14,967
<i>There is a great disturbance</i>
<i>in the Force.</i>

518
00:53:15,844 --> 00:53:18,169
I have felt it.

519
00:53:18,305 --> 00:53:20,843
<i>We have a new enemy...</i>

520
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:24,972
<i>the young rebel who destroyed</i>
<i>the Death Star.</i>

521
00:53:25,103 --> 00:53:28,223
<i>I have no doubt this boy...</i>

522
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:32,734
<i>is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>

523
00:53:32,861 --> 00:53:35,103
How is that possible?

524
00:53:35,238 --> 00:53:38,607
<i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>

525
00:53:38,742 --> 00:53:41,945
<i>You will know it to be true.</i>

526
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,534
<i>He could destroy us.</i>

527
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:46,741
He's just a boy.

528
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:49,331
Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

529
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:53,044
<i>The Force is strong with him.</i>

530
00:53:54,424 --> 00:53:59,335
<i>The son of Skywalker</i>
<i>must not become a Jedi.</i>

531
00:53:59,471 --> 00:54:01,629
If he could be turned...

532
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:04,600
he would become a powerful ally.

533
00:54:05,644 --> 00:54:07,352
<i>Yes.</i>

534
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:12,477
<i>He would be a great asset.</i>

535
00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:14,851
<i>Can it be done?</i>

536
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:18,936
He will join us or die, master.

537
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:39,505
I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't
understand why we can't see Yoda now.

538
00:54:39,636 --> 00:54:43,420
Patience. For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

539
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:48,809
Eat. Eat.

540
00:54:49,688 --> 00:54:51,016
Hot.

541
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,737
Good food. Good.

542
00:55:00,866 --> 00:55:03,783
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

543
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,152
Not far. Yoda not far.

544
00:55:06,288 --> 00:55:09,039
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.

545
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,129
Root leaf. I cook.

546
00:55:15,964 --> 00:55:18,420
Why wish you become Jedi?

547
00:55:19,509 --> 00:55:22,179
Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.

548
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:25,388
Father.
Powerful Jedi was he.

549
00:55:26,892 --> 00:55:29,248
- Powerful Jedi.
- Oh, come on.

550
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,099
How could you know my father?
You don't even know who I am.

551
00:55:32,331 --> 00:55:35,897
I don't even know what I'm doing here.
We're wasting our time!

552
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:39,608
I cannot teach him.

553
00:55:39,738 --> 00:55:41,777
The boy has no patience.

554
00:55:41,907 --> 00:55:44,149
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

555
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:51,369
Much anger in him...

556
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,326
like his father.

557
00:55:53,765 --> 00:55:57,161
<i>Was I any different</i>
<i>when you taught me?</i>

558
00:55:58,548 --> 00:55:59,548
No.

559
00:56:00,987 --> 00:56:03,670
- He is not ready.
- Yoda.

560
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,826
I am ready.

561
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,877
I can be a Jedi.
Ben, tell him I'm...

562
00:56:12,005 --> 00:56:15,837
Ready, are you?
What know you ready?

563
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:19,917
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

564
00:56:20,054 --> 00:56:23,803
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

565
00:56:25,768 --> 00:56:29,552
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment...

566
00:56:29,689 --> 00:56:31,516
the most serious mind.

567
00:56:33,526 --> 00:56:36,610
This one a long time have I watched.

568
00:56:37,697 --> 00:56:40,449
All his life
has he looked away...

569
00:56:40,575 --> 00:56:43,611
to the future,
to the horizon.

570
00:56:43,745 --> 00:56:47,279
Never his mind on where he was...

571
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:50,664
what he was doing.

572
00:56:52,378 --> 00:56:53,378
Adventure.

573
00:56:54,756 --> 00:56:56,380
Excitement.

574
00:56:56,507 --> 00:56:58,749
A Jedi craves not these things.

575
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,510
You are reckless.

576
00:57:01,638 --> 00:57:04,592
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

577
00:57:04,724 --> 00:57:06,764
He is too old.

578
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,928
Yes, too old to begin the training.

579
00:57:11,064 --> 00:57:12,973
But I've learned so much.

580
00:57:20,823 --> 00:57:24,074
- Will he finish what he begins?
- I won't fail you.

581
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,280
I'm not afraid.

582
00:57:31,793 --> 00:57:33,832
You will be.

583
00:57:35,004 --> 00:57:37,044
You will be.

584
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,559
- Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
- I'm not interested in your opinion.

585
00:58:22,688 --> 00:58:24,681
There's something out there.

586
00:58:24,816 --> 00:58:26,773
- Where?
- Outside in the cave.

587
00:58:28,486 --> 00:58:29,980
There it is. Listen!

588
00:58:30,113 --> 00:58:31,986
- I'm going out there.
- Are you crazy?

589
00:58:32,115 --> 00:58:34,635
I just got this bucket together.
I won't let it get torn apart.

590
00:58:34,784 --> 00:58:36,907
Then I'm going with you.

591
00:58:38,162 --> 00:58:41,247
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

592
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:42,374
Oh, no.

593
00:58:57,473 --> 00:58:59,513
This ground sure feels strange.

594
00:59:01,144 --> 00:59:03,183
It doesn't feel like rock.

595
00:59:07,692 --> 00:59:10,265
There's an awful lot
of moisture in here.

596
00:59:10,403 --> 00:59:14,103
I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.

597
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,438
Yeah.

598
00:59:17,535 --> 00:59:18,535
Watch out!

599
00:59:19,579 --> 00:59:22,034
It's all right. It's all right.

600
00:59:22,165 --> 00:59:24,620
Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.

601
00:59:24,751 --> 00:59:27,871
Chewie, check the rest of the ship and
make sure there are no more attached...

602
00:59:28,004 --> 00:59:29,878
chewing on the power cables.

603
00:59:30,006 --> 00:59:31,583
Mynocks?

604
00:59:31,716 --> 00:59:33,922
Go inside. We'll clean them off
if there are any more.

605
00:59:43,102 --> 00:59:45,558
Go away!
Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!

606
00:59:52,862 --> 00:59:54,689
Wait a minute.

607
01:00:16,427 --> 01:00:19,843
- Chewie, let's get out of here!
- The Empire is still out there!

608
01:00:19,972 --> 01:00:22,012
No time to discuss this
in committee!

609
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:24,932
I am not a committee!

610
01:00:30,399 --> 01:00:33,235
You can't make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

611
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:35,816
Sit down, sweetheart.
We're taking off.

612
01:00:40,618 --> 01:00:41,946
- Look!
- I see it.

613
01:00:42,078 --> 01:00:44,450
- We're doomed!
- The cave is collapsing.

614
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,454
- This is no cave.
- What?

615
01:01:18,948 --> 01:01:20,323
Yes, run.

616
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:21,992
Yes.

617
01:01:22,118 --> 01:01:25,451
A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

618
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,996
But beware of the dark side.
Anger, fear, aggression...

619
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:31,283
The dark side
of the Force are they.

620
01:01:31,419 --> 01:01:35,002
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

621
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:37,337
If once you start down
the dark path...

622
01:01:37,467 --> 01:01:39,755
forever will it dominate
your destiny.

623
01:01:39,886 --> 01:01:43,835
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

624
01:01:43,973 --> 01:01:45,800
Vader.

625
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:49,018
- Is the dark side stronger?
- No, no.

626
01:01:50,772 --> 01:01:52,729
Quicker, easier, more seductive.

627
01:01:53,608 --> 01:01:55,684
How am I to know
the good side from the bad?

628
01:01:55,818 --> 01:01:58,060
You will know...

629
01:01:58,196 --> 01:02:00,437
when you are calm,
at peace...

630
01:02:01,532 --> 01:02:02,943
passive.

631
01:02:04,035 --> 01:02:08,198
A Jedi uses the Force
for knowledge and defence...

632
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:10,158
never for attack.

633
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:13,909
- But tell me why I can't...
- No. There is no why.

634
01:02:14,045 --> 01:02:16,797
Nothing more
will I teach you today.

635
01:02:16,923 --> 01:02:18,880
Clear your mind of questions.

636
01:02:41,989 --> 01:02:43,947
There's something not right here.

637
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:49,239
I feel cold.

638
01:02:50,123 --> 01:02:51,665
- Death.
- That place...

639
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:56,291
is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

640
01:02:56,421 --> 01:02:58,330
A domain of evil it is.

641
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:01,708
In you must go.

642
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:04,125
What's in there?

643
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:09,178
Only what you take with you.

644
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:14,177
Your weapons...

645
01:03:15,064 --> 01:03:16,523
you will not need them.

646
01:05:56,768 --> 01:05:59,223
Bounty hunters.
We don't need their scum.

647
01:05:59,353 --> 01:06:02,105
- Yes, sir.
- Those rebels won't escape us.

648
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:11,106
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Stardestroyer <i>Avenger.</i>

649
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,782
Right.

650
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:18,698
There will be a substantial reward for
the one who finds the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

651
01:06:18,831 --> 01:06:21,868
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

652
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:24,124
but I want them alive.

653
01:06:24,253 --> 01:06:26,661
No disintegrations.

654
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:28,624
- As you wish.
- Lord Vader.

655
01:06:30,927 --> 01:06:32,836
My lord, we have them.

656
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:40,392
Thank goodness
we're coming out of the asteroid field.

657
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:48,223
Let's get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

658
01:06:48,361 --> 01:06:50,567
One, two...

659
01:06:50,696 --> 01:06:51,811
three!

660
01:06:58,454 --> 01:07:00,696
It's not fair.

661
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:05,079
Transfer circuits aren't working.
It's not my fault.

662
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:08,128
- No light speed?
- It's not my fault.

663
01:07:12,927 --> 01:07:14,887
Sir, we just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

664
01:07:15,054 --> 01:07:17,373
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we're done for.

665
01:07:17,473 --> 01:07:19,139
Turn her around.

666
01:07:19,267 --> 01:07:21,888
Turn her around! I'm gonna
put all power in the front shield.

667
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:23,979
- You're gonna attack?
- The odds of surviving...

668
01:07:24,147 --> 01:07:26,067
a direct assault
on an imperial Stardestroyer...

669
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,099
Shut up!

670
01:07:34,615 --> 01:07:36,573
They're moving to attack position.

671
01:07:38,786 --> 01:07:39,865
Shields up.

672
01:07:46,461 --> 01:07:49,034
Track them. They may
come around for another pass.

673
01:07:49,172 --> 01:07:51,544
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

674
01:07:51,674 --> 01:07:55,292
They can't have disappeared. No ship
that small has a cloaking device.

675
01:07:55,428 --> 01:07:59,260
- There's no trace of them.
- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.

676
01:08:02,268 --> 01:08:04,308
Get a shuttle ready.

677
01:08:04,437 --> 01:08:08,351
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.

678
01:08:08,483 --> 01:08:11,567
- Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
- Yes, Captain Needa.

679
01:08:16,282 --> 01:08:18,524
Use the Force.

680
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:19,659
Yes.

681
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:27,034
Now, the stone.

682
01:08:31,214 --> 01:08:32,838
Feel it.

683
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,352
Concentrate!

684
01:09:01,035 --> 01:09:04,071
Oh, no.
We'll never get it out now.

685
01:09:04,205 --> 01:09:05,913
So certain are you.

686
01:09:10,002 --> 01:09:13,206
Always with you
it cannot be done.

687
01:09:14,465 --> 01:09:16,422
Hear you nothing that I say?

688
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:18,627
Master, moving stones
around is one thing.

689
01:09:18,761 --> 01:09:20,588
This is totally different.

690
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:22,963
No. No different.

691
01:09:23,099 --> 01:09:25,175
Only different in your mind.

692
01:09:25,309 --> 01:09:28,513
You must unlearn
what you have learned.

693
01:09:29,897 --> 01:09:32,982
- All right. I'll give it a try.
- Try not.

694
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,270
Do...

695
01:09:35,403 --> 01:09:36,980
or do not.

696
01:09:37,113 --> 01:09:38,773
There is no try.

697
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,118
I can't. It's too big.

698
01:10:30,245 --> 01:10:32,284
Size matters not.

699
01:10:32,414 --> 01:10:35,415
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?

700
01:10:38,169 --> 01:10:41,040
And well you should not...

701
01:10:41,172 --> 01:10:43,794
for my ally is the Force.

702
01:10:43,925 --> 01:10:46,297
And a powerful ally it is.

703
01:10:47,387 --> 01:10:49,759
Life creates it...

704
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:51,929
makes it grow.

705
01:10:52,809 --> 01:10:55,596
Its energy surrounds us...

706
01:10:56,646 --> 01:10:58,438
and binds us.

707
01:10:58,565 --> 01:11:01,768
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

708
01:11:02,861 --> 01:11:06,111
You must feel
the Force around you.

709
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:09,563
Here, between you, me...

710
01:11:10,452 --> 01:11:12,694
the tree, the rock...

711
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,498
everywhere.

712
01:11:14,582 --> 01:11:16,293
Yes...

713
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:20,367
even between
the land and the ship.

714
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,542
You want the impossible.

715
01:13:15,076 --> 01:13:17,116
I don't believe it.

716
01:13:19,122 --> 01:13:21,791
That is why you fail.

717
01:13:41,061 --> 01:13:44,311
Apology accepted,
Captain Needa.

718
01:13:52,822 --> 01:13:55,859
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan and found nothing.

719
01:13:55,992 --> 01:13:58,105
If the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>
went into light speed...

720
01:13:58,205 --> 01:13:59,987
it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy now.

721
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:01,948
Alert all commands.

722
01:14:02,082 --> 01:14:06,329
Calculate every possible destination
along their last known trajectory.

723
01:14:06,461 --> 01:14:09,830
- Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
- Don't fail me again...

724
01:14:10,799 --> 01:14:12,791
Admiral.

725
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:18,255
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.

726
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,446
Captain Solo,
this time you have gone too far.

727
01:14:36,575 --> 01:14:39,659
I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

728
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,940
The fleet's beginning to break up.

729
01:14:42,069 --> 01:14:44,940
Go stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

730
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,275
I really don't see
how that's going to help.

731
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:52,861
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

732
01:14:52,997 --> 01:14:55,073
The Empire may be
gracious enough...

733
01:14:55,207 --> 01:14:57,615
- Thank you.
- What did you have in mind next?

734
01:14:57,751 --> 01:14:59,660
If they follow standard
imperial procedure...

735
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,073
they'll dump their garbage
before they go to light speed.

736
01:15:02,173 --> 01:15:05,173
- Then we just float away.
- With the rest of the garbage.

737
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,711
Then what?

738
01:15:06,844 --> 01:15:10,094
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

739
01:15:10,222 --> 01:15:11,597
Any ideas?

740
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:14,096
- Where are we?
- The Anoat system.

741
01:15:14,226 --> 01:15:16,799
The Anoat system.
There's not much there.

742
01:15:16,937 --> 01:15:19,772
Oh, wait.
This is interesting.

743
01:15:19,898 --> 01:15:22,769
- Lando.
- Lando system?

744
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:26,484
Lando's not a system.
He's a man. Lando Calrissian.

745
01:15:26,613 --> 01:15:28,855
Card player, gambler.

746
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:31,564
- A scoundrel. You'd like him.
- Thanks.

747
01:15:31,702 --> 01:15:34,371
Bespin. It's pretty far,
but I think we can make it.

748
01:15:35,873 --> 01:15:38,909
- A mining colony?
- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

749
01:15:39,793 --> 01:15:41,916
Lando conned somebody out of it.

750
01:15:42,046 --> 01:15:44,750
We go back a long way,
Lando and me.

751
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:48,844
- Can you trust him?
- No.

752
01:15:48,969 --> 01:15:51,840
But he's got no love for the Empire.
I can tell you that.

753
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:55,553
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by. Detach.

754
01:16:03,215 --> 01:16:04,862
You do have your moments.

755
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:08,029
Not many of them,
but you do have them.

756
01:16:42,815 --> 01:16:44,724
Concentrate.

757
01:16:44,858 --> 01:16:48,062
Feel the Force flow.

758
01:16:48,195 --> 01:16:49,820
Yes.

759
01:16:57,496 --> 01:16:59,156
Good.

760
01:16:59,289 --> 01:17:00,665
Calm.

761
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:02,119
Yes.

762
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,623
Through the Force,
things you will see.

763
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:09,458
Other places.
The future. The past.

764
01:17:09,669 --> 01:17:11,749
Old friends long gone.

765
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:23,730
Control, control.

766
01:17:23,856 --> 01:17:26,062
You must learn control.

767
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:32,028
I saw a city in the clouds.

768
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:36,274
Friends you have there.

769
01:17:37,369 --> 01:17:40,987
- They were in pain.
- It is the future you see.

770
01:17:42,207 --> 01:17:43,207
Future?

771
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:53,628
Will they die?

772
01:17:56,889 --> 01:17:58,965
Difficult to see.

773
01:17:59,099 --> 01:18:01,555
Always in motion is the future.

774
01:18:04,063 --> 01:18:05,473
I've gotta go to them.

775
01:18:07,483 --> 01:18:10,519
Decide you must
how to serve them best.

776
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:13,523
If you leave now,
help them you could...

777
01:18:14,615 --> 01:18:18,150
but you would destroy all
for which they have fought and suffered.

778
01:18:32,216 --> 01:18:35,003
No, I don't have a landing permit.

779
01:18:35,135 --> 01:18:38,754
I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

780
01:18:38,889 --> 01:18:41,012
Wait a minute!
Let me explain!

781
01:18:41,141 --> 01:18:43,098
<i>You will not deviate</i>
<i>from your present course.</i>

782
01:18:43,227 --> 01:18:45,932
- Rather touchy, aren't they?
- I thought you knew this person.

783
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:51,645
That was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about that.

784
01:19:00,244 --> 01:19:03,862
<i>Permission granted to land</i>
<i>on Platform 327.</i>

785
01:19:03,998 --> 01:19:05,373
Thank you.

786
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:09,162
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

787
01:19:09,294 --> 01:19:10,954
Who's worried?

788
01:19:59,803 --> 01:20:01,214
No one to meet us.

789
01:20:02,639 --> 01:20:04,965
I don't like this.

790
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,935
- What would you like?
- They did let us land.

791
01:20:08,062 --> 01:20:10,766
Look, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

792
01:20:10,898 --> 01:20:12,522
Trust me.

793
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:19,319
See? My friend.

794
01:20:23,744 --> 01:20:25,783
Keep your eyes open.

795
01:20:28,499 --> 01:20:30,123
Hey.

796
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:34,331
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

797
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:38,674
You've got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

798
01:20:49,186 --> 01:20:52,637
How you doin', you old pirate?
So good to see you!

799
01:20:52,773 --> 01:20:55,809
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Well, he seems very friendly.

800
01:20:55,943 --> 01:20:59,027
Yes. Very friendly.

801
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:00,779
What are you doing here?

802
01:21:00,906 --> 01:21:02,899
Repairs. I thought
you could help me out.

803
01:21:03,033 --> 01:21:05,655
- What have you done to my ship?
- Your ship?

804
01:21:05,786 --> 01:21:09,321
Hey, remember,
you lost her to me fair and square.

805
01:21:10,207 --> 01:21:11,582
How you doin', Chewbacca?

806
01:21:12,543 --> 01:21:15,212
Still hanging around with this loser?

807
01:21:17,214 --> 01:21:19,539
Hello.
What have we here?

808
01:21:21,051 --> 01:21:24,586
Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this facility.

809
01:21:24,722 --> 01:21:27,639
- And who might you be?
- Leia.

810
01:21:27,766 --> 01:21:29,391
Welcome, Leia.

811
01:21:32,229 --> 01:21:35,064
All right, all right.
You old smoothie.

812
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:38,809
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

813
01:21:38,944 --> 01:21:41,731
My facilities are at your...
Well, really!

814
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:44,236
- What's wrong with the <i>Falcon?</i>
- Hyperdrive.

815
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,406
- I'll get my people to work on her.
- Good.

816
01:21:46,535 --> 01:21:48,575
That ship saved my life
quite a few times.

817
01:21:48,704 --> 01:21:51,242
She's the fastest
hunk of junk in the galaxy.

818
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:55,038
How's the gas mine?
Still paying off for you?

819
01:21:55,169 --> 01:21:59,001
Not as well as I'd like. We're a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

820
01:21:59,131 --> 01:22:02,215
I've had supply problems
of every kind.

821
01:22:02,343 --> 01:22:04,501
I've had labour difficulties.

822
01:22:04,636 --> 01:22:07,887
- What's so funny?
- You. Listen to you.

823
01:22:08,015 --> 01:22:10,802
You sound like a businessman,
a responsible leader.

824
01:22:10,934 --> 01:22:12,808
Who'd have thought that, huh?

825
01:22:12,936 --> 01:22:15,854
Seeing you sure brings back
a few things.

826
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:17,179
Yeah.

827
01:22:17,316 --> 01:22:19,439
Yeah, I'm responsible these days.

828
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:22,988
It's the price you pay
for being successful.

829
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,281
Nice to see a familiar face.

830
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,035
How rude!

831
01:22:31,622 --> 01:22:33,661
That sounds like
an R2 unit in there.

832
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:35,368
I wonder if... Hello?

833
01:22:37,628 --> 01:22:39,170
How interesting.

834
01:22:39,296 --> 01:22:42,380
- Who are you?
- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.

835
01:22:42,508 --> 01:22:44,547
I didn't mean to intrude.
Please don't get up.

836
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,774
Luke, you must complete the training.

837
01:23:06,871 --> 01:23:09,658
I can't keep the vision out of my head.
I've gotta help them.

838
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,913
You must not go.

839
01:23:12,042 --> 01:23:15,127
- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
- <i>You don't know that.</i>

840
01:23:18,132 --> 01:23:20,801
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

841
01:23:20,926 --> 01:23:23,678
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.

842
01:23:23,804 --> 01:23:25,624
But you cannot control it.

843
01:23:25,856 --> 01:23:27,989
This is a dangerous time for you...

844
01:23:28,327 --> 01:23:31,643
when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.

845
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:34,974
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.

846
01:23:35,858 --> 01:23:37,269
The cave.

847
01:23:37,401 --> 01:23:39,477
Remember your failure at the cave.

848
01:23:39,612 --> 01:23:41,521
But I've learned
so much since then.

849
01:23:41,655 --> 01:23:44,325
Master Yoda, I promise to return
and finish what I've begun.

850
01:23:44,450 --> 01:23:46,407
You have my word.

851
01:23:46,535 --> 01:23:49,322
It is you and your abilities
the emperor wants.

852
01:23:49,455 --> 01:23:52,160
That is why your friends
are made to suffer.

853
01:23:53,626 --> 01:23:56,295
That's why I have to go.

854
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:00,749
Luke, I don't want to lose you
to the emperor the way I lost Vader.

855
01:24:00,883 --> 01:24:02,377
You won't.

856
01:24:03,233 --> 01:24:06,843
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.

857
01:24:07,435 --> 01:24:11,174
Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
with the Force as his ally...

858
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:13,883
will conquer Vader
and his emperor.

859
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:16,097
If you end your training now...

860
01:24:16,232 --> 01:24:20,525
if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did...

861
01:24:20,653 --> 01:24:23,274
you will become an agent of evil.

862
01:24:23,405 --> 01:24:24,405
Patience.

863
01:24:25,324 --> 01:24:29,701
- And sacrifice Han and Leia?
- If you honour what they fight for...

864
01:24:29,829 --> 01:24:30,829
yes.

865
01:24:30,955 --> 01:24:34,039
If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.

866
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:36,159
I cannot interfere.

867
01:24:38,254 --> 01:24:39,452
I understand.

868
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:47,557
R2, fire up the converters.

869
01:24:52,944 --> 01:24:54,902
Don't give in to hate.

870
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:57,782
That leads to the dark side.

871
01:24:57,908 --> 01:24:59,616
Strong is Vader.

872
01:24:59,743 --> 01:25:02,234
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

873
01:25:03,205 --> 01:25:04,699
I will.

874
01:25:04,831 --> 01:25:07,287
And I'll return. I promise.

875
01:25:14,383 --> 01:25:17,419
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.

876
01:25:17,552 --> 01:25:19,130
Now...

877
01:25:19,262 --> 01:25:21,006
matters are worse.

878
01:25:21,139 --> 01:25:23,179
<i>That boy is our last hope.</i>

879
01:25:23,308 --> 01:25:26,226
No, there is another.

880
01:25:58,385 --> 01:26:01,671
The ship's almost finished. Two or three
more things and we're in great shape.

881
01:26:01,805 --> 01:26:03,845
The sooner the better.
Something's wrong here.

882
01:26:03,974 --> 01:26:06,013
No one has seen or knows
anything about 3PO.

883
01:26:06,143 --> 01:26:08,349
He's been gone too long
to have gotten lost.

884
01:26:08,478 --> 01:26:10,186
Relax.

885
01:26:10,314 --> 01:26:13,184
I'll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

886
01:26:13,317 --> 01:26:15,772
I don't trust Lando.

887
01:26:15,902 --> 01:26:19,236
Well, I don't trust him either,
but he is my friend.

888
01:26:19,364 --> 01:26:22,034
Besides, we'll soon be gone.

889
01:26:23,493 --> 01:26:25,533
Then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

890
01:27:00,572 --> 01:27:02,066
What happened?

891
01:27:03,158 --> 01:27:04,158
Where?

892
01:27:05,994 --> 01:27:07,987
Found him in a junk pile?

893
01:27:08,121 --> 01:27:10,659
What a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

894
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:16,334
- Lando's got people that can fix him.
- No, thanks.

895
01:27:17,923 --> 01:27:19,750
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting anything?

896
01:27:20,717 --> 01:27:21,832
Not really.

897
01:27:25,389 --> 01:27:27,381
You look absolutely beautiful.

898
01:27:27,516 --> 01:27:30,801
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

899
01:27:30,936 --> 01:27:32,395
Thank you.

900
01:27:32,521 --> 01:27:35,438
Would you join me
for a little refreshment?

901
01:27:35,565 --> 01:27:38,353
Everyone's invited, of course.

902
01:27:38,485 --> 01:27:40,561
Having trouble with your droid?

903
01:27:40,696 --> 01:27:43,317
No. No problem. Why?

904
01:27:52,165 --> 01:27:54,656
You see, since we're
a small operation...

905
01:27:54,793 --> 01:27:58,043
we don't fall into
the jurisdiction of the Empire.

906
01:27:58,171 --> 01:28:00,709
- So you're part of the Mining Guild?
- No, not actually.

907
01:28:00,841 --> 01:28:02,999
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

908
01:28:03,135 --> 01:28:05,174
Which is advantageous
for everybody...

909
01:28:05,304 --> 01:28:09,716
since our customers are anxious to avoid
attracting attention to themselves.

910
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:13,717
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
gonna find out, shut you down?

911
01:28:13,854 --> 01:28:17,139
It's been a danger that looms like
a shadow over everything we've built.

912
01:28:17,274 --> 01:28:19,979
But things have developed
that'll ensure security.

913
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:23,396
I've just made a deal that'll keep
the Empire out of here forever.

914
01:28:33,123 --> 01:28:35,910
We would be honoured
if you would join us.

915
01:28:42,799 --> 01:28:45,172
I had no choice.
They arrived right before you did.

916
01:28:46,136 --> 01:28:47,796
I'm sorry.

917
01:28:51,308 --> 01:28:52,636
I'm sorry too.

918
01:29:07,491 --> 01:29:08,866
No, 3PO's with them.

919
01:29:10,285 --> 01:29:12,361
Just hang on.
We're almost there.

920
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:14,386
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to intrude.

921
01:30:14,516 --> 01:30:16,473
No, please don't get up.

922
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:25,685
Stormtroopers? Here?
We're in danger.

923
01:30:25,819 --> 01:30:28,392
I must tell the others.
Oh, no! I've been shot!

924
01:30:56,224 --> 01:30:57,849
Lord Vader.

925
01:30:57,976 --> 01:31:00,348
You may take Captain Solo
to Jabba the Hutt...

926
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:02,471
after I have Skywalker.

927
01:31:02,606 --> 01:31:04,480
He's no good to me dead.

928
01:31:04,608 --> 01:31:07,893
He will not be
permanently damaged.

929
01:31:10,322 --> 01:31:12,860
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

930
01:31:12,991 --> 01:31:15,696
They must never again leave this city.

931
01:31:15,827 --> 01:31:19,031
That wasn't part of our agreement, nor
was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

932
01:31:19,164 --> 01:31:23,078
Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?

933
01:31:25,837 --> 01:31:26,837
No.

934
01:31:26,964 --> 01:31:30,498
Good. It would be unfortunate
if I had to leave a garrison here.

935
01:31:32,928 --> 01:31:35,300
This deal is getting worse
all the time.

936
01:31:36,515 --> 01:31:38,887
Oh, yes, that's very good.
I like that.

937
01:31:40,519 --> 01:31:43,057
Something's not right
because now I can't see.

938
01:31:45,607 --> 01:31:47,814
That's much better.

939
01:31:47,943 --> 01:31:49,567
Wait. Wait.

940
01:31:49,695 --> 01:31:51,734
Oh, my!
What have you done?

941
01:31:51,863 --> 01:31:53,406
I'm backwards!

942
01:31:53,532 --> 01:31:55,405
You flea-bitten furball!

943
01:31:55,534 --> 01:31:58,203
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

944
01:32:12,801 --> 01:32:14,758
I feel terrible.

945
01:32:30,027 --> 01:32:32,066
Why are they doing this?

946
01:32:34,573 --> 01:32:37,242
They never even asked me
any questions.

947
01:32:46,585 --> 01:32:48,743
- Get out of here, Lando.
- Shut up and listen.

948
01:32:48,879 --> 01:32:51,963
Vader's agreed
to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.

949
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:53,970
They'll have to stay here,
but they'll be safe.

950
01:32:54,092 --> 01:32:56,215
- And Han?
- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.

951
01:32:56,345 --> 01:32:58,752
- Vader wants us all dead.
- He doesn't want you at all.

952
01:32:58,889 --> 01:33:02,258
He's after somebody
called Skywalker.

953
01:33:02,392 --> 01:33:04,930
- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
- And we're the bait.

954
01:33:05,062 --> 01:33:06,888
- He's on his way.
- Perfect.

955
01:33:07,856 --> 01:33:10,062
You fixed us all real good,
didn't you?

956
01:33:10,192 --> 01:33:11,354
My friend.

957
01:33:14,363 --> 01:33:15,561
Stop!

958
01:33:16,865 --> 01:33:19,023
I've done all I can.

959
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:21,567
Sorry I couldn't do better,
but I got my own problems.

960
01:33:21,703 --> 01:33:22,984
Yeah.

961
01:33:23,121 --> 01:33:24,948
You're a real hero.

962
01:33:35,759 --> 01:33:38,215
You certainly
have a way with people.

963
01:33:52,609 --> 01:33:54,436
This facility is crude...

964
01:33:54,569 --> 01:33:57,654
but it should be adequate
to freeze Skywalker...

965
01:33:57,781 --> 01:34:00,023
for his journey to the emperor.

966
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:03,159
Lord Vader,
ship approaching, X-wing class.

967
01:34:03,287 --> 01:34:06,655
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

968
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:12,917
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing. It might kill him.

969
01:34:13,046 --> 01:34:15,917
I do not want
the emperor's prize damaged.

970
01:34:16,049 --> 01:34:19,134
We will test it on Captain Solo.

971
01:34:42,909 --> 01:34:47,121
If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't
be in this ridiculous position.

972
01:34:47,247 --> 01:34:49,916
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

973
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:51,750
so don't do anything foolish.

974
01:35:05,849 --> 01:35:07,889
What's going on, buddy?

975
01:35:08,852 --> 01:35:10,928
You're being put into carbon freeze.

976
01:35:11,063 --> 01:35:14,562
What if he doesn't survive?
He's worth a lot to me.

977
01:35:14,691 --> 01:35:18,060
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

978
01:35:22,032 --> 01:35:23,195
Chewbacca, stop!

979
01:35:23,325 --> 01:35:25,317
No, Chewie, stop!

980
01:35:25,452 --> 01:35:28,453
You're going to get us all killed!
Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.

981
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:30,537
Hey! Hey!
Listen to me.

982
01:35:30,666 --> 01:35:33,157
Chewie, this won't help me.

983
01:35:33,293 --> 01:35:35,867
Hey, save your strength.
There'll be another time.

984
01:35:37,756 --> 01:35:39,381
The princess.

985
01:35:39,508 --> 01:35:41,585
You have to take care of her.

986
01:35:43,803 --> 01:35:45,978
Do you hear me?

987
01:35:59,661 --> 01:36:02,357
- I love you.
- I know.

988
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,143
What's going on?
Turn round. I can't see.

989
01:37:34,039 --> 01:37:36,078
They've encased him in carbonite.

990
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:38,082
He should be quite
well-protected...

991
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:40,119
if he survived
the freezing process, that is.

992
01:37:40,253 --> 01:37:42,745
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

993
01:37:42,881 --> 01:37:44,506
Yes, he's alive.

994
01:37:45,384 --> 01:37:47,257
And in perfect hibernation.

995
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:50,343
He's all yours, bounty hunter.

996
01:37:51,223 --> 01:37:52,931
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

997
01:37:55,352 --> 01:37:57,179
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

998
01:37:57,312 --> 01:38:01,180
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

999
01:38:05,445 --> 01:38:07,319
Calrissian...

1000
01:38:07,447 --> 01:38:09,855
take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

1001
01:38:09,992 --> 01:38:12,114
You said they'd be left
under my supervision.

1002
01:38:12,244 --> 01:38:14,283
I am altering the deal.

1003
01:38:14,413 --> 01:38:17,117
Pray I don't alter it any further.

1004
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:57,038
Luke, don't! It's a trap!

1005
01:39:58,545 --> 01:39:59,625
It's a trap!

1006
01:40:46,051 --> 01:40:48,423
The Force is with you,
young Skywalker.

1007
01:40:50,848 --> 01:40:52,887
But you are not a Jedi yet.

1008
01:41:54,912 --> 01:41:56,536
Well done.

1009
01:41:58,332 --> 01:42:01,119
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet.

1010
01:42:01,251 --> 01:42:02,911
Move.

1011
01:42:07,382 --> 01:42:10,668
- What do you think you're doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1012
01:42:10,803 --> 01:42:12,546
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

1013
01:42:12,679 --> 01:42:15,515
Do you think that
after what you did to Han...

1014
01:42:16,517 --> 01:42:19,802
- I had no choice.
- What are you doing? Trust him!

1015
01:42:19,937 --> 01:42:22,938
We understand, don't we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

1016
01:42:23,065 --> 01:42:24,607
I'm just trying to help.

1017
01:42:24,733 --> 01:42:27,355
We don't need any of your help.

1018
01:42:32,491 --> 01:42:33,985
What?

1019
01:42:34,118 --> 01:42:38,696
- It sounds like Han.
- There's still a chance to save Han...

1020
01:42:39,665 --> 01:42:42,915
at the east... platform.

1021
01:42:47,131 --> 01:42:49,254
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1022
01:42:49,383 --> 01:42:51,126
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

1023
01:42:52,094 --> 01:42:54,763
Put Captain Solo
in the cargo hold.

1024
01:43:09,987 --> 01:43:12,229
R2, where have you been?

1025
01:43:12,364 --> 01:43:14,238
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

1026
01:43:15,451 --> 01:43:18,202
Hurry! We're trying to save
Han from the bounty hunter.

1027
01:43:20,956 --> 01:43:23,364
Well, at least
you're still in one piece.

1028
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,826
Look what's happened to me.

1029
01:43:37,806 --> 01:43:40,380
Oh, no!
Chewie, they're behind you!

1030
01:43:53,363 --> 01:43:55,689
You have learned much, young one.

1031
01:43:55,824 --> 01:43:57,947
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

1032
01:44:09,546 --> 01:44:12,631
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

1033
01:44:13,509 --> 01:44:15,964
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

1034
01:44:24,061 --> 01:44:25,389
All too easy.

1035
01:44:30,651 --> 01:44:33,106
Perhaps you're not as strong
as the emperor thought.

1036
01:44:36,281 --> 01:44:37,906
Impressive.

1037
01:44:39,868 --> 01:44:41,279
Most impressive.

1038
01:44:49,169 --> 01:44:52,834
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You have controlled your fear.

1039
01:44:55,634 --> 01:44:58,837
Now, release your anger.

1040
01:44:58,971 --> 01:45:01,544
Only your hatred can destroy me.

1041
01:47:12,521 --> 01:47:14,430
The security code
has been changed.

1042
01:47:14,565 --> 01:47:17,850
R2, you can tell the computer
to override the security systems.

1043
01:47:18,819 --> 01:47:20,527
R2, hurry.

1044
01:47:23,824 --> 01:47:26,113
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.</i>

1045
01:47:26,243 --> 01:47:28,200
<i>The Empire has taken control</i>
<i>of the city.</i>

1046
01:47:28,328 --> 01:47:31,164
<i>I advise everyone to leave</i>
<i>before more imperial troops arrive.</i>

1047
01:47:37,671 --> 01:47:39,296
This way.

1048
01:47:39,423 --> 01:47:41,629
Well, don't blame me.
I'm an interpreter.

1049
01:47:41,759 --> 01:47:44,629
I'm not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

1050
01:48:06,241 --> 01:48:09,159
We're not interested in the hyperdrive
on the <i>Falcon.</i> It's fixed!

1051
01:48:14,166 --> 01:48:16,953
Just open the door,
you stupid lump!

1052
01:48:25,552 --> 01:48:27,960
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

1053
01:48:52,496 --> 01:48:55,201
That hurts! Bend down,
you thoughtless... Ow!

1054
01:49:02,339 --> 01:49:03,714
Go!

1055
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:12,926
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

1056
01:49:13,058 --> 01:49:14,932
Of course I've looked better.

1057
01:50:08,614 --> 01:50:12,279
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

1058
01:50:12,409 --> 01:50:15,909
Don't let yourself be destroyed
as Obi-Wan did.

1059
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:33,345
There is no escape.

1060
01:50:34,223 --> 01:50:36,346
Don't make me destroy you.

1061
01:50:40,354 --> 01:50:43,106
You do not yet realize
your importance.

1062
01:50:43,232 --> 01:50:45,901
You have only begun
to discover your power.

1063
01:50:46,026 --> 01:50:47,853
Join me...

1064
01:50:47,986 --> 01:50:50,359
and I will complete your training.

1065
01:50:50,489 --> 01:50:52,861
With our combined strength...

1066
01:50:52,991 --> 01:50:55,909
we can end
this destructive conflict...

1067
01:50:56,036 --> 01:50:58,325
and bring order to the galaxy.

1068
01:50:58,455 --> 01:51:00,946
I'll never join you!

1069
01:51:01,083 --> 01:51:05,163
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

1070
01:51:05,295 --> 01:51:09,507
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

1071
01:51:09,633 --> 01:51:11,044
He told me enough.

1072
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:15,506
He told me you killed him.

1073
01:51:17,307 --> 01:51:19,383
I am your father.

1074
01:51:27,943 --> 01:51:29,852
That's not true.

1075
01:51:30,738 --> 01:51:32,362
That's impossible!

1076
01:51:32,489 --> 01:51:35,739
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

1077
01:51:44,585 --> 01:51:48,713
You can destroy the emperor.
He has foreseen this.

1078
01:51:48,839 --> 01:51:51,710
It is your destiny.

1079
01:51:51,842 --> 01:51:53,550
Join me...

1080
01:51:53,677 --> 01:51:57,971
and together we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

1081
01:52:08,609 --> 01:52:10,233
Come with me.

1082
01:52:11,111 --> 01:52:13,270
It is the only way.

1083
01:53:19,555 --> 01:53:20,930
Ben.

1084
01:53:21,807 --> 01:53:23,634
Ben, please.

1085
01:53:51,587 --> 01:53:53,164
Hear me.

1086
01:54:00,137 --> 01:54:02,176
- We've got to go back.
- What?

1087
01:54:02,306 --> 01:54:04,631
- I know where Luke is.
- What about those fighters?

1088
01:54:05,768 --> 01:54:08,009
Chewie, just do it.

1089
01:54:08,145 --> 01:54:09,853
All right, all right!

1090
01:54:18,072 --> 01:54:22,116
Alert my Stardestroyer
to prepare for my arrival.

1091
01:54:32,669 --> 01:54:34,709
Look, someone's up there.

1092
01:54:35,964 --> 01:54:38,420
It's Luke.
Chewie, slow down.

1093
01:54:38,550 --> 01:54:41,836
We'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

1094
01:54:57,778 --> 01:55:00,103
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

1095
01:55:21,885 --> 01:55:24,008
- Lando?
- <i>Okay, let's go.</i>

1096
01:55:44,074 --> 01:55:45,485
All right, Chewie. Let's go.

1097
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:22,896
I'll be back.

1098
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:30,036
Stardestroyer.

1099
01:56:35,292 --> 01:56:37,748
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

1100
01:56:37,878 --> 01:56:39,918
If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

1101
01:56:40,047 --> 01:56:42,372
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

1102
01:56:42,508 --> 01:56:43,966
Punch it!

1103
01:56:54,645 --> 01:56:56,933
They told me they fixed it.

1104
01:56:57,064 --> 01:56:58,938
I trusted them!

1105
01:56:59,066 --> 01:57:01,557
It's not my fault!

1106
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:09,820
They'll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

1107
01:57:09,952 --> 01:57:13,487
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

1108
01:57:13,622 --> 01:57:15,615
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

1109
01:57:15,749 --> 01:57:19,367
Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

1110
01:57:19,503 --> 01:57:22,504
- Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

1111
01:57:24,091 --> 01:57:27,376
Noisy brute. Why don't we
just go into light speed?

1112
01:57:27,511 --> 01:57:29,089
We can't?

1113
01:57:29,221 --> 01:57:31,593
How would you know
the hyperdrive is deactivated?

1114
01:57:34,893 --> 01:57:37,764
The city's central computer told you?

1115
01:57:37,896 --> 01:57:40,648
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

1116
01:57:40,774 --> 01:57:44,060
Ouch! Pay attention
to what you're doing.

1117
01:57:56,373 --> 01:57:57,536
Father.

1118
01:57:59,418 --> 01:58:01,541
Son, come with me.

1119
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:06,000
Ben.

1120
01:58:07,092 --> 01:58:09,168
Why didn't you tell me?

1121
01:58:27,404 --> 01:58:28,602
It's Vader.

1122
01:58:34,453 --> 01:58:38,036
Luke, it is your destiny.

1123
01:58:45,756 --> 01:58:47,998
Why didn't you tell me?

1124
01:58:54,306 --> 01:58:58,220
Alert all commands.
Ready for the tractor beam.

1125
01:59:01,688 --> 01:59:04,440
R2, come back at once!
You haven't finished with me yet.

1126
01:59:04,566 --> 01:59:08,066
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1127
01:59:08,195 --> 01:59:12,608
I'm standing here in pieces
and you're having delusions of grandeur!

1128
01:59:15,786 --> 01:59:17,245
You did it!

1129
02:00:14,818 --> 02:00:17,971
- Luke, we're ready for take-off.
- <i>Good luck, Lando.</i>

1130
02:00:19,016 --> 02:00:22,966
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt and</i>
<i>that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.</i>

1131
02:00:23,103 --> 02:00:25,725
I'll meet you at
the rendezvous point on Tatooine.

1132
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,416
Princess, we'll find Han.
I promise.

1133
02:00:29,545 --> 02:00:31,752
Chewie, I'll be waiting
for your signal.

1134
02:00:32,155 --> 02:00:33,589
Take care, you two.

1135
02:00:33,907 --> 02:00:35,756
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>
