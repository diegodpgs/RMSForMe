19
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,431
What you are saying
are not good reasons for a divorce.

20
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,142
- If there is something else let me know.
- Like what?

21
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,522
Like if he is an addict, beats you
or does not give you an allowance.

22
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,983
Nothing like that.
He is a good, decent person.

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,111
Then why do you want a divorce?

24
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,862
He won't come with me.

25
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:58,408
If he does
I'll cancel my request for a divorce.

26
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,620
- Will you come?
- No, I won't.

27
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,456
- Why not, your honour?
- You know why.

28
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,000
No I don't.
Please explain again why.

29
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,045
Let her explain why we should move
abroad in these circumstances.

30
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,548
- You give me one reason to stay.
- I'll give you a thousand.

31
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,260
- Just one.
- My father. I can't leave him.

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,427
But you can leave your wife?

33
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,180
- When did I leave you?
- You brought me here.

34
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,348
You filed for a divorce.

35
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,518
When you tell your wife and child
to leave, isn't that leaving them?

36
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,062
Your honour, didn't he just say
leave if you want?

37
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,605
Yes and I'll say it again.

38
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,191
If you don't want to stay
I can't keep you by force.

39
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,235
Keep your voice down.
Calm down.

40
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,488
One day you came to live with me.
Today you don't.

41
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,158
- When you prefer...
- What does "you prefer" mean?

42
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,951
This was something we both started.

43
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:45,539
Your honour, after 18 months of running
around and expenses, we got our visa.

44
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,418
It has been six months now
and it will expire in 40 days.

45
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,295
Why should we lose this opportunity?

46
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,883
You don't want to lose this opportunity,
then make a suggestion.

47
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,092
You know my situation.

48
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,178
Tell us what to do, your honour.

49
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,890
- His father is his excuse...
- He is not my excuse. He's the reason.

50
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,766
- Let me speak.
- Calm down.

51
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,020
His father has Alzheimer's.
He doesn't even know that he's his son.

52
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,524
- What difference does it make to him?
- Why are you saying that?

53
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,568
Does he even realise you are his son?

54
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,612
I know he is my father.

55
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,781
Your daughter or her future
is not important to you?

56
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,744
Who said anything about our daughter?
Why do you think only you care?

57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,497
So the children living in this country
don't have a future?

58
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,959
As a mother, I'd rather she didn't
grow up in these circumstances.

59
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,587
What circumstances?

60
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,468
Is she better off here with both her
parents or there without a father?

61
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,304
That's why I want him to come.

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,431
I can't leave.

63
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,892
How many times do I have to say it?

64
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,437
He can't come.
So what happens to me?

65
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,065
Nothing. Go back to your life.

66
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,193
If I could
I wouldn't file for a divorce.

67
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,113
Consent has to be mutual.

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,115
He just gave his.

69
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,533
Do you agree to a divorce?

70
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,537
If she prefers to leave her family
to go live abroad, yes I do.

71
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,539
He agrees.

72
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,416
What about my daughter?

73
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,836
You have to agree on everything.
How old is your daughter?

74
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,047
11 in two weeks.

75
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,259
She can't leave
without her father's permission.

76
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,135
He won't give permission.

77
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,096
That's between you two.

78
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,099
Please sign here and good day.

79
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,059
Your honour, I came here
for you to solve my problem.

80
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,644
Please sign here.

81
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,812
You too.

82
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,606
- Where should I sign?
- Here.

83
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,734
He can have everything,
I just want my daughter.

84
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,697
Our daughter is attached to me.
She doesn't even want to go with you.

85
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,157
- She doesn't know better.
- Why not?

86
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,618
She is 11 years old.

87
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,746
Please sign here
and don't take the court's time.

88
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:53,125
- No one knows better except you.
- No, you're the one who knows better.

89
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,421
Your honour, what should I do?
I only have 40 days.

90
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,548
You can't file for a divorce
over every little problem.

91
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,049
A little problem?

92
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,385
My problem is not little.

93
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,222
It is my daughter.

94
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,766
She is his daughter too.
He has rights too.

95
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,561
My finding is that your problem
is a small problem.

96
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,855
Please sign here and good day.

97
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,280
Nader and Simin, A Separation

98
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,616
Producer, Writer, Director
Asghar Farhadi

99
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,774
You said the second floor.

100
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,442
This is the second floor.

101
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,610
Then what's that?

102
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,489
That's the ground floor, that's the first.
This is the second.

103
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,325
The price we gave was for two floors.

104
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,285
But the buyer will pay you.

105
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,661
Only for two floors.

106
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,748
I don't understand what you're saying.

107
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,999
Call the buyer.

108
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,919
This is three floors.

109
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,340
I'll pay for one floor.
Let me pass.

110
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,130
Excuse me, ma'am?

111
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,262
Go tell your dad
they want to leave.

112
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,638
Why don't you tell him?

113
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,349
What did I say?

114
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,392
Didn't we agree?

115
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,729
I'm studying.

116
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,616
Hello.

117
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,951
Hello, ma'am.

118
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,496
I'll be right there.

119
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,501
I don't know how much you know.

120
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:46,131
The work is taking care of my father.

121
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,300
There is some housework too,

122
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,387
but the main work is giving him
his medication on time,

123
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:57,184
keeping him away from the stove,
from leaving the house.

124
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,270
Termeh, get your laundry.

125
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:05,317
You have to be here at 7:30
so I can go to work.

126
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,819
7:30 is too early.

127
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,323
I'll have to leave my house at 5
to get here by then.

128
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,991
Can you make it by 8?

129
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,659
I don't know.

130
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,954
8 is good too.

131
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,332
Ring the upstairs bell.

132
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,668
I'll leave the house keys up here.

133
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,920
- OK?
- Yes.

134
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,297
Can you pay us please?

135
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,090
What's the pay per month?

136
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,509
She'll be right there.

137
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,801
300,000 a month.

138
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,553
That's too little.

139
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,472
No, that's the rate.

140
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,390
Ask around.
The commute is far.

141
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,309
Several bus lines.

142
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,144
It's what I can afford.

143
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,481
If you agree
you can start tomorrow.

144
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,899
Can I let you know tomorrow?

145
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,276
They might need this too.

146
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,569
I don't have change.

147
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,987
You have till the afternoon.

148
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,157
There is someone else I can hire
if you can't come.

149
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,201
OK.

150
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,329
Termeh! Your laundry!

151
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,890
You're not coming?

152
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,109
- Why are you taking your books?
- I want them.

153
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,779
All this for just 2 weeks?

154
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,082
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

155
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,672
Which setting does she use?

156
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,966
Should I go ask her?

157
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,886
You want to make me look bad?

158
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,810
- Simin, where're you going?
- I'll be right back.

159
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,064
Just to the corner.
I'll be right back.

160
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,861
I'll come back.

161
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,614
I have an appointment.

162
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,282
Four.

163
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,200
Why four?

164
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,202
Because it has faded.

165
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:25,540
She must have used it the most.

166
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,127
Four it is.

167
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,673
From now on
we'll set everything on four.

168
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,884
She is really leaving.

169
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,385
She'll be back.

170
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,553
Termeh!

171
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,765
Come stay with your grandfather.

172
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,818
Dad?

173
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,447
Termeh, honey, go to your room.

174
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,200
Dad, get up.

175
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,202
Let go of her hand.

176
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,665
Get up.
I want to take you to the bathroom.

177
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,838
Where are you taking me?

178
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,550
The bathroom
and then to get the paper.

179
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,261
Darling, I said go to your room...

180
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,892
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

181
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,981
Don't put your hand there.

182
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,593
I'm taking this CD.

183
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,430
Take whichever you want.

184
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,432
No, just this one.

185
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,826
Bye.

186
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,488
I thought you live there too.

187
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,990
No, I've moved to my mum's.

188
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,536
This is a bit difficult.

189
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,080
No, you can trust him.

190
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,417
Don't worry about these things.

191
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,878
Besides, he won't be around.

192
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:22,008
He leaves early
and comes back when you leave.

193
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,138
Do bring your daughter.
She'll keep my daughter company

194
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,599
and I'll feel better.

195
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,357
Tell your sister-in-law
your decision.

196
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,758
Where are you going?

197
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,902
What's this?

198
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,697
Oxygen.

199
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,282
What's oxygen?

200
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,284
Get away.
You'll wake him.

201
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,525
I can't hear anything.

202
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,787
What is it doing?

203
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,926
Hello.

204
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,636
Where do you want to go?

205
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,638
- The paper.
- What?

206
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,723
I want the paper.

207
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,810
The paper is in your room.

208
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,397
Come, I'll take you to your room.

209
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,322
I'll take you to your room
and get your meal.

210
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,665
Mummy...

211
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,001
he's peed in his pants.

212
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,883
Sit on the bed.

213
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,181
What's that?

214
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,981
What are you doing here?

215
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,318
Go get your shoes.
You can see the floor's wet.

216
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,948
He'd say when he needed to go...

217
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,870
Take him to the bathroom...

218
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,085
I can't come till 12. I have class.

219
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,339
Call my husband.

220
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,341
Do you have his number?

221
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,178
Write it down.

222
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,430
There's a pen by the phone.

223
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,987
If I bring you some pants
can you change?

224
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,199
Your clothes, can you change them?

225
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,367
Simin?

226
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,036
Can you wash yourself?

227
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,204
Simin?

228
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,966
Here are your clothes.

229
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,930
Wash yourself and put them on.

230
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,100
I put your towel here.

231
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,102
- OK?
- Yes.

232
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,355
Clean yourself up.

233
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,566
Put your pants in there.

234
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,323
Will you manage?

235
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,087
Your pants.

236
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,005
Take them off.

237
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,883
Wear the ones I gave you.

238
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,552
OK?

239
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,685
Simin...

240
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,092
Hello.
I had a religious question.

241
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,136
I am working in a house.

242
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:44,473
There is an old man
I am supposed to care for.

243
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,184
I wanted to ask...

244
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,604
Pardon me,
but he has wet his pants.

245
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,650
I wanted to know if I change him,
will it count as a sin?

246
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,861
No one is here.

247
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:03,701
He's 70 or 80 years old
and he's senile...

248
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:12,501
The urgency is that the poor guy
has been sitting like this for half an hour.

249
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,753
I can...?

250
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,473
I won't tell dad.

251
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,684
My angel.

252
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,147
Get up.

253
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,776
Open your legs.

254
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,072
OK, now take off your pants.

255
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,174
Card!

256
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,645
Everyone's staring.

257
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,563
Let them.

258
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,482
- How much?
- 37.5.

259
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,651
- Any change?
- He didn't give it.

260
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,279
- You asked?
- It's his tip.

261
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,030
Tip?
Sir, wait one sec.

262
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,243
A tip is for when he pumps the gas.
Go get it.

263
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,911
- Dad!
- Quick!

264
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,330
Wait.

265
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,771
Here.

266
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,190
Keep it.

267
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,358
Really?

268
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,876
Hello.

269
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,044
Hello, Termeh.

270
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,337
Hello.

271
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,007
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

272
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,802
I'll get my books.

273
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,554
And your test results.

274
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,973
- How are you, Ms Qahraei?
- Fine, thanks, and you?

275
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,975
Fine, thanks.

276
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,518
Sorry we're late.

277
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,354
It's OK.
How's your wife?

278
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,315
- Good, thank you.
- We'll get started.

279
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,610
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

280
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,321
How are you, Dad?

281
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,740
- Hi, young lady.
- Hello.

282
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,742
Here's the paper.

283
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:56,040
Did you read the paper for him
or did he read it for you?

284
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,043
Son...

285
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,420
Ali is married.

286
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,923
- Who's Ali?
- Ali.

287
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,759
Yeah, Ali's married.
Termeh, hurry.

288
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,844
His oxygen valve wasn't shut.

289
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,222
He must've opened it.

290
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,475
From tomorrow tighten it a bit more
so he can't open it.

291
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,560
Sorry, but...

292
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,271
I can't come anymore.

293
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,316
Didn't we say every day?

294
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,026
The commute is too much.

295
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,154
I turned someone else away.
It's 4pm.

296
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,949
How can I find someone now
for tomorrow morning?

297
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,701
It's too much work.

298
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,038
Really I can't.
The work is heavy, I can't.

299
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,960
Come to the other room, please.

300
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,505
- Somayeh, where's your scarf?
- It's here.

301
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,510
Maybe you're tired
because it's your first day.

302
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,595
No.

303
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,181
You were here for a few minutes.
You saw.

304
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,643
Somayeh, come get your bag.

305
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,896
Can you please give me that number?

306
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,193
They also do sonograms.

307
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,654
It moved a lot today.

308
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,822
Then it's a boy.

309
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,576
It was kicking in Mummy's tummy.

310
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,454
Because he wants to come out...

311
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,456
To play with me.

312
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,839
Can you write it in here please?

313
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,176
Tell them Qahraei sent you.

314
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,094
They know me.

315
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,098
- Is it a man or a woman?
- A woman.

316
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,476
Call first.

317
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,603
You had to tell me yesterday.

318
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,522
How can I leave him at home
alone tomorrow?

319
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,068
- Where does your mum keep the tea?
- I don't know.

320
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,905
You should've told me
I've to clean him.

321
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,239
Clean him?

322
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,783
He soiled his pants today.

323
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,666
It's not right for me to clean him.

324
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,634
Please pay me for today
so I can go.

325
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,146
He always said
when he had to go.

326
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,861
There are companies you can call
for a male helper.

327
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,906
I can't just let anyone into my home.

328
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,951
Here.

329
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,245
Count it, please.

330
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,080
Sorry, but it's a religious issue.

331
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,331
It's OK.

332
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,458
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

333
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,751
Bye.

334
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,419
Goodbye.

335
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,096
Yes?

336
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,014
I wanted to know
if it is OK for me

337
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,976
to give your number to my husband

338
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,061
and tell him I got it out of the paper.

339
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,480
For the housework and your father.

340
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,482
Give him the job description

341
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,401
and if he agrees
tell him to come...

342
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,570
I don't want to tell him
I know you.

343
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,238
I didn't tell him
I was coming here.

344
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:19,243
Then tell him to call me
or tell him to come here tonight.

345
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,579
It's late for tonight.

346
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,330
I'll come tomorrow.

347
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,333
Just don't give the job to anyone else.

348
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,586
You'll see with him for the money.

349
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,421
That's not a problem.
Tell him to call me.

350
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,922
I will arrange to meet him.

351
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,550
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye.

352
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,760
And thank you.

353
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,564
Mr Lavasani?

354
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,400
Go ahead.

355
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,796
Hello. I am Samadi.

356
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,715
- I called about the job.
- Yes, how are you?

357
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,883
Sorry I'm late.

358
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,136
It's OK.
Where did you work before?

359
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,471
I was a cobbler.

360
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,848
And you're OK with cleaning him?

361
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,183
With what?

362
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,644
Since yesterday
he's been soiling himself.

363
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,356
I'll treat him like my own father.

364
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,776
But you'll be alone with him
and you have to really watch him.

365
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,069
Your wife won't be there?

366
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,780
No, I am single for now.

367
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,786
Excuse me but isn't 300,000
too little for this work?

368
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,371
How much did you have in mind?

369
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,373
Maybe if you could pay 400,000...

370
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,166
I really can't pay that.

371
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,085
I'll come for a few days.

372
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,171
If you like my work,
add something to the 300,000.

373
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,590
- If not don't pay me.
- Here's the address.

374
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,092
I can even start today.

375
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:02,221
No, there's someone there today.
Start tomorrow and bring an ID.

376
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,889
Like what?

377
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,142
Any legal ID will do.

378
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:08,936
Pious?

379
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,479
Worshipper.

380
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,772
Barren?

381
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,190
Sandbar.

382
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,858
Desert!

383
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,068
Desert.

384
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,194
Insurrection?

385
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,779
Rebellion.

386
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,407
Doorbell?

387
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,075
- Razieh.
- No!

388
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,118
Her husband.

389
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,160
Yes.

390
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,043
Give the Persian version
of the following words...

391
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,129
- "Maquette"?
- Nemunak.

392
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,463
"Compote"?

393
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,673
Khoshaab.

394
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,258
"Guarantee"?

395
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,051
Tazmin, zemanat.

396
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,137
That's Arabic, not Persian.

397
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,431
That's what my teacher said.

398
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,849
Don't give me that.

399
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:51,562
What's wrong is wrong,
no matter who says what.

400
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,358
- For "guarantee" write...
- She'll deduct points.

401
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,526
That's OK, let her.

402
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,612
Write poshtvaneh.

403
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,948
Poshtvaneh.

404
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,167
Hello.

405
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,969
What happened? Your husband
was supposed to come today.

406
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,637
Sorry, he couldn't make it.

407
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,182
What about tomorrow?

408
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,559
I don't know.
If he doesn't, I'll come.

409
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,687
I hope he won't change his mind
everyday.

410
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,773
No, poor guy wanted to come.

411
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,068
Last night, one of his creditors came
with an officer and took him away.

412
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,197
Yes but if something comes up
and he can't make it

413
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,698
I need to know in advance.

414
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,326
No, he will definitely come.

415
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,830
I'll go see the creditor
and beg him

416
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,832
to release him.

417
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,376
Please lock the door behind me.

418
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,711
Goodbye.

419
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,752
Hi.

420
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,346
Don't step on it.
It is dirty.

421
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,934
Go take the garbage out.

422
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,771
Can you?

423
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,107
Yes.

424
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,212
Where will I get you a clean dress?

425
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,634
Take it off!

426
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,640
Mummy...

427
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,225
he's not in his room.

428
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,853
- What?
- He's not in his room.

429
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,106
Go look in the bathroom.

430
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,525
Like that.

431
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,361
Block the ball. OK?

432
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,547
Give me five.

433
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,885
- Grandpa, whose side are you on?
- He's the manager.

434
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,811
Did you see that?

435
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,253
What's wrong?

436
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,255
Sit here.

437
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,726
You OK?

438
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,912
Where've you been?

439
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,165
Poor thing has been waiting
for half an hour.

440
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,501
It's a long commute.

441
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,169
Hello.

442
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,507
Also, take the garbage out
with the bin.

443
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,551
The bags tear and dirty the stairs.

444
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:00,222
Yesterday I got dizzy.
I dropped the bag and it tore.

445
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,890
I'll mop the stairs.

446
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,726
Go in.

447
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,394
Let us in.

448
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,111
Let me close the door.

449
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,600
- Mrs...
- She's not there?

450
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,396
- What's her kid's name?
- Somayeh.

451
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,442
Don't sit there. It's wet.

452
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:59,322
Somayeh!

453
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,878
Mrs Khalani!

454
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,589
Knock.

455
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,301
Grandpa!

456
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,969
Mrs Khalani!

457
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,055
Yes.

458
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,891
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

459
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,351
Did you see the lady that works for us?

460
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,395
She was mopping the stairs.

461
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,856
- When?
- Before noon.

462
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,151
- She's not there?
- No. Thanks.

463
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,404
Wait here.
I'll get the keys from the car.

464
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,586
What's wrong?

465
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,963
Dad?

466
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,237
Get his feet.

467
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,413
Dad, get up, look at Termeh.

468
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,082
Dad!

469
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,681
He's breathing.

470
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,932
Don't worry.

471
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,989
Does your arm hurt?
Help me take his shirt off.

472
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,910
Move your arm.

473
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,578
Does it hurt?

474
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,583
Take a step.

475
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,628
Walk.

476
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,131
Let's get the paper, Dad.

477
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,799
Move your leg.

478
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,723
Does it hurt?
Let me see what's happened.

479
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,183
Who did this to you?

480
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,771
I want to see if your legs are OK.

481
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,526
Let me...
Honey, go to your room.

482
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,779
- Has something happened?
- No. Go out.

483
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,033
She's gone, Dad.

484
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,286
Let me see your legs.

485
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,205
Take them off.

486
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,730
Scum!

487
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,815
Honey, did you take money
from the drawer?

488
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:21,983
No.

489
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,361
OK, go to the kitchen.

490
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,825
I told you to go to the kitchen.

491
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,912
You saw that nothing happened.

492
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,582
Go on... Close the door.

493
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,823
Hello.

494
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,201
Come here.

495
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,913
Mummy, I'm thirsty.

496
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,214
Watch him.

497
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,134
Hello.

498
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,469
Where were you?

499
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,975
Something came up.
I had to go out.

500
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,436
You had no right to go.

501
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,189
- He was asleep.
- So you lock the door and leave?

502
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,776
I was gone briefly.

503
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,821
Briefly? You're lying.

504
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,157
He was dying when I got here!

505
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,534
He always naps at this time so I...

506
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,995
So you do this everyday?

507
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,581
Lock the door and run your errands?

508
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,583
No. I swear to God, today I had to.

509
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,752
- Why did you tie his hand?
- Go wait outside.

510
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,257
Was this our agreement?

511
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,925
I had to go.

512
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,052
I had no choice.

513
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,637
Thanks a lot!

514
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,056
You tie his hand everyday

515
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,683
and go do your own stuff.

516
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,851
Is he OK?

517
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,645
Thanks a lot!

518
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,440
Wait outside, sweetie.

519
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,817
Go check on grandpa.

520
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,905
Why did you go in that room?

521
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,072
Which room?

522
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,701
Which room?
The one you took the money from.

523
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,579
I took money from that room?

524
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,915
- Don't I pay you?
- I took money?

525
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,082
You didn't take it?

526
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,502
I swear I didn't take any money.

527
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,378
Get out.

528
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,798
Sir, I'm swearing on our martyrs.

529
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,637
You say I took money.

530
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,974
Here, look in my bag.
If I took it, it should be here.

531
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,309
Here, take this.

532
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,187
Give me my bag.

533
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,482
I am swearing on our martyrs
that I didn't go there.

534
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,025
Here's my bag.

535
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,777
What are you doing?

536
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:11,945
I didn't go there.

537
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,490
I'm swearing on our martyrs
that I didn't step into that room.

538
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,700
- Get out.
- You're saying...

539
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:21,246
What did I do?
Don't touch me!

540
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,706
I won't touch you.
Get out.

541
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:28,628
I won't leave
till I get what I deserve!

542
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,673
What you deserve
is for me to kick you out.

543
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,801
Because of her I won't.

544
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:38,846
Get out! I'm doing you a favour
by throwing you out.

545
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,849
Tell me what's happened to him.

546
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,768
It's my house, I want you out.

547
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,145
Fine but it's not right.

548
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,856
- It displeases God.
- Out!

549
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,276
That's it.

550
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,155
Dad.

551
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,252
Open the door.
It's me. I want to come in...

552
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,964
This is how you watch him?

553
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,469
Open the door.

554
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,889
Go check what's behind you.

555
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,558
Have a look.

556
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:25,893
Open the door!

557
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,605
It's no use shouting.

558
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,941
This is why I asked you to watch him.

559
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,403
Maybe his leg hurts
and he can't get up.

560
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,614
Grandpa...

561
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,744
Dad, open the door.

562
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,371
Open the door, please.

563
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,208
I'm going to push the door open.

564
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:53,212
It'll hit you, Dad. Move aside.

565
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:58,051
I'm going to push the door open.

566
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,723
Why do you do this to yourself?

567
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,654
Who told you to come in?

568
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,531
- What happened to him?
- Give me the key. Get out!

569
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,866
I didn't steal from you.

570
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,660
You are pissing me off!

571
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,827
I didn't.

572
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:28,748
- Don't give me that!
- I wouldn't be here now if I had.

573
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,916
Get out.

574
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,459
Pay me for today.

575
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:35,213
You already took your pay, didn't you?

576
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,592
Since 5:30 this morning
with my daughter... Somayeh!

577
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,010
Sir, wait!

578
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,512
Get out.

579
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:46,140
I swear I didn't steal.

580
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,892
Get out!

581
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:08,037
What happened?

582
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,706
Sit.

583
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,589
What happened?

584
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,886
Mummy, be careful.

585
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,585
Tell her to work with you
on your English.

586
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,504
Bye, Grandpa.

587
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,298
Dad, Termeh said bye.

588
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,053
Careful!

589
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,893
OK.

590
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,688
What is it?

591
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,066
Mum says come in.

592
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,109
Tell her
grandpa's in the car.

593
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,444
She says it's important.

594
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:10,034
Not divorced yet
and already ignoring us!

595
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,869
I'm busy.

596
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,164
People divorce their wives
to get less busy.

597
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,209
Ma'am, these channels
have too much static.

598
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,420
OK, set the ones you can.

599
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,881
- Come and sit.
- Thank you. Simin...

600
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,012
Hi.

601
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,767
Where's Termeh?

602
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,352
In the car with dad.

603
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,187
Then bring him in too.

604
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,022
No, he is tired.

605
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,482
It's his nap time.

606
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,861
What is it?

607
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,737
Did you have a fight
with that woman?

608
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,990
Did she come see you?

609
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,783
Her sister-in-law called.

610
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,702
Shameless!

611
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,078
What did she do?

612
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,582
Tied the old man to the bed
and locked the door.

613
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,458
Went after her own errands.

614
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,295
If I'd gotten there 10 minutes later
I would've lost him.

615
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,713
Is he OK?

616
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,214
He had fallen off the bed.

617
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,758
I don't know for how long
he was like that.

618
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,010
Where had she gone?

619
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,219
How should I know?

620
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,096
She said you hit her.

621
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,514
I hit her?

622
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,642
- Nonsense.
- Then why is she in the hospital?

623
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,938
Hospital? Why?

624
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,149
You're asking me?

625
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,859
I just pushed her out of the house.

626
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,320
The sister-in-law called
and told me off.

627
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,654
Saying what?

628
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,199
That if she dies,
her blood will be on your hands.

629
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,077
Stuff like that.

630
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:42,209
- She didn't say what happened?
- I hung up. She started cursing.

631
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,673
That's what you get
for hiring people off the streets.

632
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:52,136
Don't blame me. I told you
I only know her sister-in-law.

633
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,971
Did she say which hospital?

634
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,645
- Hello.
- Yes?

635
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,272
Hold please.

636
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:07,151
A woman by the name of Razieh
was brought in tonight.

637
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,780
- What's her family name?
- I don't know. She was admitted earlier.

638
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,114
Why was she brought in?

639
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,076
- They just told us...
- That she was taken to hospital.

640
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,079
I'll call you back. Bye.

641
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,248
Her husband's last name is Samadi.

642
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,046
Razieh Asnaqi?

643
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,840
Is she in her thirties?

644
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,844
She had surgery.
She's in post-op.

645
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,304
Why surgery?

646
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,723
She had a miscarriage.

647
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,561
Is she OK now?

648
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,688
Hello? Hold.

649
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,814
Yes.

650
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,067
Is her family here?

651
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,986
If they are,
they are downstairs.

652
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,654
Thank you.

653
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,621
What did you do to her?

654
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,166
What did I do to her?

655
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,771
Hello.

656
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,735
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

657
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,236
Hello, ma'am.

658
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,446
How is she?

659
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,531
Who?

660
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,992
Your wife.

661
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,286
They took her to the ward.

662
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,663
Do you know her?

663
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,166
- I know her.
- My wife.

664
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,419
- They didn't have sandwiches.
- Hello.

665
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,052
Can we see her?

666
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,220
Where do you know her from?

667
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:02,433
Your sister introduced her to us
for housework.

668
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,101
Thanks a lot!

669
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,105
She was coming
to your house to work?

670
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,357
She came for a few days.

671
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,611
Apparently you couldn't come
so she came in your place.

672
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,571
Come sit and eat something.

673
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,866
You mean
she took care of your father?

674
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,077
Just for a few days.

675
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,578
Two or three days.

676
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,456
Why didn't you tell me this
at the bank?

677
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,835
I thought she would tell you.

678
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,880
Why have you come here now?

679
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,882
To see if we can do something.

680
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,092
Do what?

681
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,677
Help. We were worried.

682
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,846
Did she fall?

683
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:44,225
Come with me. I'll explain.

684
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,311
I'll explain to you...
Come with me.

685
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,688
I understand your situation.

686
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,733
You kill her child
and now you've come to do what?

687
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,026
I'm really sorry.

688
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:56,904
I'm sorry
won't be a child to her.

689
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,489
Just tell me one thing.

690
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,074
I'll explain outside.

691
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,743
Wait! Why didn't you tell me that day?

692
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,204
I told you. I thought she...

693
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,960
You live alone in that house.

694
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,421
Let him go.

695
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,966
Calm down.

696
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,553
This is a hospital.

697
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,222
Don't!

698
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,640
Stop!

699
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,397
Why the hell did you come here?

700
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,943
Let me see.

701
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,779
- My own sister?
- I'm sorry.

702
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:39,780
Forgive me.

703
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:40,865
Let me see.

704
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,787
Come out here.

705
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,207
I want to talk to you.

706
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,004
Please, I beg you. Hojjat!

707
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,347
Do you want your seat down?

708
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,016
No.

709
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,478
I'll take you home
then I'll get dad and Termeh.

710
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,356
No.

711
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,942
No?

712
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,155
You want to go
to your parents' like this?

713
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,409
It's over.
You're coming home tonight.

714
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,330
I don't want to.

715
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,508
Where are you going?

716
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,645
Hand it in.

717
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,924
Did you hear his complaint?

718
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,301
It was the 13th.

719
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:09,013
I'm sorry.
I was really upset when I heard.

720
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,640
- I went to the hospital.
- Then you admit it.

721
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,935
Is this the medical examiner's report?

722
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:19,565
It is the hospital report
that we took

723
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,734
to the medical examiner.

724
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,444
Four and half months, male.

725
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,987
Please explain.

726
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,614
I accept that I was a bit rough.

727
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,491
By rough you mean you pushed her?

728
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,703
No. I tried to get her out of my house.

729
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,332
Be clear.
Your charge is murder.

730
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,169
It was 1 9 weeks old.
A full human being.

731
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,214
I didn't intend to push her.

732
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,675
I wanted her to leave
so I could close the door.

733
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,761
- You didn't push me?
- Ma'am, please.

734
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,221
If I knew she were pregnant,

735
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,725
I wouldn't even have tried
to get her out of the house.

736
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,519
I just wanted to close the door.

737
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,313
Do you accept his explanation?

738
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:03,400
He didn't push. He grabbed me here
and threw me and I fell on the stairs.

739
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,652
I didn't throw you.

740
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:08,530
I wanted to get you out of my house.

741
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,741
Who throws out a pregnant woman?

742
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,617
I didn't know.

743
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,743
Why are you lying?

744
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,037
I found out in the hospital.

745
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,374
Your honour, can't everyone tell

746
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,668
from the body of a woman
that she is pregnant?

747
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,212
Four to five months pregnant.

748
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,089
When would I even see you?

749
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,300
I was already gone or leaving
when she'd come.

750
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,428
When I'd come, she looked like this.

751
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,889
Always with the chador.

752
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,808
How can anyone tell
she was pregnant?

753
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,143
He can claim that he couldn't guess.

754
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:43,607
I didn't think a pregnant woman
would come for this kind of work.

755
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,944
Your honour, I spoke of my pregnancy

756
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,406
in front of him,
his daughter and her tutor.

757
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,658
They all heard it.

758
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,701
When?
I don't remember.

759
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,787
No, of course you wouldn't remember.

760
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,748
The issue isn't that I knew or not.

761
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,458
Yes.

762
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,293
If it's proven that you knew

763
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,964
the court can request
a prison term of one to three years.

764
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,426
- Well?
- What?

765
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,220
No, I didn't know.

766
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,390
His daughter's tutor can testify.

767
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,891
Can she come in tomorrow?

768
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,561
I don't want her or the school involved.

769
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,230
It's not good for my daughter.

770
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,899
You trash.
You've killed my child.

771
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,401
It's bad for your child?

772
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:31,113
She matters
but ours was an animal?

773
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,030
Don't insult...

774
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,951
Am I insulting?
He took my pregnant wife...

775
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,953
Quiet or I'll put you in prison.

776
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,414
Please, he's a bit hot-tempered.

777
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,625
Hot-tempered?

778
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:48,547
I should sue you for working
for a single man we don't even know.

779
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,593
I wanted to help with the bills.
He hasn't worked for months.

780
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,971
The tutor has to come in as a witness.

781
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,807
Call her to come in tomorrow.

782
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,060
Your honour,

783
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,730
I'm here today for one thing.

784
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:08,066
I lost my child
but it didn't hurt as much

785
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,111
as when he accused me
of being a thief.

786
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,321
We're thieves?

787
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,739
If we stole

788
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,326
we wouldn't come to wipe
your father's arse.

789
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,953
Do you have proof that she stole?

790
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,497
I didn't say she stole.

791
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,166
Money was missing

792
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:27,085
and it was the same amount
that I pay her.

793
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,587
Is that why you fought?

794
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,088
He accused her of stealing.

795
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,133
Your honour,
my father has Alzheimer's.

796
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:37,638
She tied his hand to the bed
and left the house.

797
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,431
That day I came home early.

798
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,226
I saw him on the floor
with his hand tied.

799
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,852
I thought he had died.

800
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,687
She came back

801
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,524
and I'm not saying I wasn't angry,

802
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,691
I was.

803
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:52,694
I told her to leave
and she wouldn't.

804
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,821
Where should I have gone?

805
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,532
He accused me of stealing.

806
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,284
If I hadn't asked for the money and left

807
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,662
he would've thought I had stolen.

808
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,413
Sit down.

809
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,707
- Was your father hurt?
- Yes, he was.

810
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,543
How hurt?
If he had been

811
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,503
he would've filed a complaint.

812
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,088
Yes, he was hurt.

813
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,589
Where are you going?

814
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,093
I'm going to check on my child.

815
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,386
Come back quick.

816
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,054
Close the door.

817
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,640
What's taking so long?

818
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,811
I'm not well.
You go, I'll come.

819
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,813
He says
you locked up his father and left.

820
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,816
What should I say?

821
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,569
Say?
If he complains you'll be charged.

822
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,489
Where's Somayeh?

823
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,657
Over there.

824
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,909
Go.
I'll get her and come.

825
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,911
Let's go.

826
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,639
Yes?

827
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:48,602
He was sleeping.
I locked the door to keep him in.

828
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:53,023
Even he would lock the door
and leave me the key.

829
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,608
I saw that he does it so I...

830
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,069
He says you tied him to the bed.

831
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:03,283
I was afraid he would wake up
and do something to himself.

832
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,620
I was afraid for him.

833
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,997
Why did you leave?

834
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,249
- So you should hit her?
- Quiet!

835
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,627
Who said
you could touch my wife?

836
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:14,419
Sir, get out.

837
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,005
They don't care about honour,
I do.

838
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:20,300
- Don't be offensive.
- Leave the room.

839
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,055
I want to file a complaint
against this woman.

840
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,348
Write your complaint.

841
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:30,268
Take your father to the medical examiner.
If he's hurt get a report.

842
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,937
What happens to our complaint?

843
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,439
Sign this and leave.

844
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,191
You have to post bail.

845
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:38,026
What for?

846
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,696
You're charged with murder.

847
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,864
I can't let you leave.

848
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,534
The blood money is forty million.

849
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,744
How am I going to post bail?

850
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:52,040
I live at my dad's.
He has Alzheimer's.

851
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,292
If you don't you'll go to jail.

852
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,671
My father can't even come here.

853
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,297
He's sick.

854
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,716
Please don't.

855
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,343
I can't go to jail.

856
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,138
I've left him at home to come here.

857
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,639
I can't go to jail.

858
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,641
I can't post bail.

859
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,351
It's not in my hands.
It's the law.

860
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,769
Wait one second.

861
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,647
What should I do with my dad?

862
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,859
I left him at home
and locked the door to come here.

863
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,736
My child will come home from school.

864
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,237
Please.
What are you writing?

865
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:25,115
Don't waste time.
Go make your call.

866
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,492
I can't go to jail.
I won't go.

867
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,453
Write what you want!

868
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,704
Go get an officer.

869
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,789
What for? Don't.

870
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,375
I'm begging you.

871
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,461
Please don't write it.

872
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,881
My life will be ruined.

873
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,174
Don't waste time.

874
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,842
Go make your call.

875
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:50,932
Hello, Termeh. I'm stuck here.
They're keeping me tonight.

876
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:54,519
Don't worry. It's nothing.
But you'II be aIone tonight.

877
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:58,565
Take care of the house.
Take grandpa to the bathroom regularly.

878
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,859
Take care of yourself.
I’ll call you tomorrow.

879
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,145
If you hadn't left
dad wouldn't be in jail.

880
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:40,607
Your dad's not in jail because of me.

881
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,609
He hit a pregnant woman.

882
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,402
She came because you left.

883
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,364
How upset he was that I left.

884
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,575
He knew you weren't really leaving.

885
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,203
Did you tell him?

886
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,664
No, he knew.

887
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,082
Tell me the truth.

888
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,750
You told him?

889
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,135
Get your stuff.
We're going to grandma's.

890
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,512
What about grandpa?

891
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:11,805
We'll take him too.

892
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,599
I have homework.
I'm not coming.

893
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:17,477
- You'll be on your own...
- Fine.

894
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,898
You'd better not call.

895
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:35,954
He doesn't even ask me to stay.

896
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,415
He doesn't refuse to divorce.

897
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:42,252
After having lived together for 14 years.

898
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,587
Dad!

899
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,800
What are you doing here?

900
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,011
Who're you with?

901
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,181
Didn't you have an exam?

902
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,558
No, it's tomorrow.

903
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,477
Who're you with?

904
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,650
Hello.

905
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,402
Shouldn't you tell us
you're in trouble

906
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,154
so we can help you?

907
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,031
I didn't want to trouble you.

908
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,866
Silly man.

909
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,077
- Sit.
- No, ma'am, he has a hearing.

910
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,374
Where's grandpa?

911
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,167
He's safe.

912
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,671
What are they saying?

913
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,132
"My child" as if their 18-year old son

914
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:12,968
was stabbed to death.

915
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,552
Did you speak to them?

916
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,472
You can't even speak to the man.

917
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:20,225
I told the wife, "You're young.

918
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:23,979
"You can try next year."

919
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:26,856
What happened?

920
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,859
- I have to appraise the house.
- OK, go.

921
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,528
Hi.

922
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,489
- I'll be back.
- We'll be here.

923
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:41,121
Thanks.

924
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,417
- Hi, Mrs Lavasani.
- Hi, how are you?

925
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:46,710
Good, you?

926
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:50,213
- Sorry we're troubling you.
- No, what trouble?

927
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,842
Is it true what they're saying?

928
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:57,387
Yes, unfortunately he pushed her
and she fell and lost her baby.

929
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,305
So what should I tell them?

930
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,350
I don't know what they'll ask.

931
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:06,980
What if he asks something
to his disadvantage?

932
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,441
I think you should tell the truth.

933
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:10,817
Please don't stand there.

934
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,610
Where was he?

935
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,779
Mr Lavasani was in the kitchen.

936
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:18,116
He didn't have a reaction
to your conversation?

937
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,534
If he did I didn't notice.

938
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,162
How did you realise
she was pregnant?

939
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,331
I think she told me.

940
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,292
You asked.
Why should I tell you?

941
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,839
Her daughter was drawing
a man and a woman.

942
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,591
She said
this is my mummy and daddy.

943
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,053
I said your mummy's not that fat.
She said she was pregnant.

944
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,138
So it wasn't from her appearance?

945
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,431
No.

946
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,724
Why are you lying?

947
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,350
You're a woman.

948
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:47,979
You can't tell if a woman is pregnant?

949
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:50,398
Even if I could tell

950
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:53,985
what difference does it make
for Mr Lavasani?

951
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,404
This woman is his daughter's tutor.

952
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,364
They've fixed their story.

953
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,116
Why are you insulting this lady?

954
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,826
No one's talking to you.

955
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,120
When did I have the opportunity
to fix my story?

956
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,830
I was here last night.

957
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,042
One thing is clear.
Now that we are speaking,

958
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:12,879
that man over there
can hear us, can't he?

959
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:14,964
I didn't hear you.

960
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:19,928
My mind is on other things.

961
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:23,223
Why would I listen to your conversation?

962
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,266
Do I have to swear to God?

963
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,726
Like you believe in God!

964
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,812
No, God is for your type only!

965
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,939
Open that window.

966
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,651
He is an honourable man.

967
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,320
I've been going there for a year
to teach his daughter.

968
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,198
He's not like that.

969
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:43,743
Why should she hide her pregnancy?

970
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,788
If I knew
I wouldn't have hired her.

971
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:50,375
Why did you hire her
without her husband's permission?

972
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,127
Thank you.

973
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,878
You may go.

974
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,171
Thank you.

975
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:04,597
"During the Sassanid period,
people were divided into two classes,

976
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:07,392
"the royalty,

977
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:11,271
"the upper class and the normal people."

978
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,356
"The regular class."

979
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,362
What did they ask you?

980
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:23,366
Whether your dad knew
she was pregnant.

981
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,411
Forgive us for taking your time.

982
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:30,540
There's nothing to forgive.

983
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,917
Sweetie, how did mummy lose her baby?

984
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:35,211
She got a tummy ache.

985
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,798
Why?

986
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:41,801
Did daddy fight with her?

987
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,554
Why should he fight with her?

988
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,725
Maybe because she didn't tell him
she was working in people's homes?

989
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,520
- Did he hit her?
- My mum and dad never fight.

990
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:57,358
Then why were they fighting
in your drawing that day?

991
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:59,027
You showed me.

992
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,945
They don't fight anymore.

993
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:03,406
No?

994
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,450
You're sure?

995
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:12,373
Yesterday he said
he didn't know she was pregnant.

996
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:14,709
Now he says he didn't push her.

997
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:17,503
And you just stand there in silence!

998
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:20,256
Honestly, didn't you push me?

999
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,675
- I didn't say I...
- Listen...

1000
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,802
Don't repeat everything.

1001
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,430
How far is the door
from the stairs?

1002
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,681
Two metres?

1003
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,643
What else can have happened to her?

1004
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,144
The corridor in our house...

1005
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,812
- Look...
- I am talking!

1006
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,606
Don't talk. Just answer.

1007
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,524
Quiet!

1008
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,862
You've come here to answer.

1009
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,240
I've a question for you to answer.

1010
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:46,449
I want to ask him...

1011
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,450
Ask me.

1012
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,162
If you hadn't done anything wrong,
why'd you come to the hospital

1013
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,164
to see what was wrong with her?

1014
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,999
I came out of decency.

1015
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,252
Where was your decency
when you hit her?

1016
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,462
Was anyone there
during the fight?

1017
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,214
The neighbours were there.

1018
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,632
I'll order questionings.

1019
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,760
They're in it too just like the teacher.

1020
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:08,179
He's been insulting me from the start!

1021
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:10,098
Am I lying?

1022
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:12,225
I'll determine who's lying or not.

1023
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,685
You be quiet.

1024
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:17,355
Sir, do you realise
his ex-wife has posted his bail?

1025
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:18,690
Oh my God!

1026
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,358
Can someone vouch for you?

1027
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:21,651
What do you mean?

1028
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,696
A government employee
or business-owner to vouch for you.

1029
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,739
- No one.
- Why vouch?

1030
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,741
Because she's been accused.

1031
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,118
Accused of what?

1032
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,996
According to the complaint he filed...

1033
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,247
Which he had no right...

1034
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,917
She admitted that she tied his father
to the bed and locked him up.

1035
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,085
I explained to you why.

1036
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,586
Her child just died.

1037
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,797
Keep your voice down.

1038
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,759
Aren't you ashamed?
You call yourself a man?

1039
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:49,220
I said quiet.

1040
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,434
For God's sake, listen to us

1041
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,768
for a change.

1042
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:58,563
He is twisting everything.

1043
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,607
He beat my wife
and she had a miscarriage.

1044
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:04,569
What could be clearer?
Why are you being unjust?

1045
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:05,987
Listen to us for a change.

1046
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:09,365
If you disturb the peace,
I'll send you to jail for three days.

1047
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:12,493
I've lost everything.
You think I fear jail?

1048
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:14,704
You should fear God.

1049
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,291
Mr Izadi, call an officer to arrest him.

1050
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,419
Sir, for the sake of the Qoran, don't.

1051
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:24,172
- No, let them come and take me.
- Go out. Be quiet.

1052
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:27,300
Why be quiet?
So they can trample my rights?

1053
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,968
Go out.

1054
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:33,181
- Fine, I'm leaving.
- Sir, come out.

1055
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,682
Let me get my helmet.

1056
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,351
Get out.

1057
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,979
I worked for ten years with a cobbler.

1058
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:43,733
They fired me and said
get justice if you can.

1059
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:48,905
I sued and went back and forth
for a year. In the end, nothing.

1060
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,866
They said go sit at home.

1061
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:53,951
But this time I won't let it go.

1062
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,829
This time it's different.

1063
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,582
I have nothing to lose.

1064
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,710
The problem is
I can't talk like this guy.

1065
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,837
I am hot-tempered.

1066
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,839
Don't!

1067
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,016
Hojjat?

1068
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,144
I don't feel well.

1069
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,021
Go sit there.

1070
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,147
Let's go!

1071
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:26,192
- What do you want? He's calm.
- I have to take him.

1072
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,653
I'm going to talk to the judge.

1073
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,155
Stay there and don't move.

1074
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,913
Sir...

1075
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,415
I beg you...

1076
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,958
Please let me speak.

1077
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,669
Sir, he's stressed out.

1078
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:47,255
I've been patient for the past two days.

1079
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,591
I swear, he's been
in and out of prison the past month.

1080
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,552
His creditors put him in prison.

1081
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,846
I begged them to let him come out.

1082
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:57,432
I beg you to forgive him.

1083
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:00,059
Sir, look.

1084
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:03,354
Look at these.

1085
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,858
Sir, can I ask you
to please forgive him this time?

1086
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,610
Sir, everyday he has to take these.

1087
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,988
I swear I'm not lying.

1088
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:17,410
Sir, since he was fired,
he's been depressed.

1089
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,995
He can't help it.

1090
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,622
Sir, you're his elder.

1091
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:23,624
Please forgive him.

1092
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:29,380
Go tell him to find
someone to vouch for you.

1093
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:31,215
God bless you.

1094
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:33,384
Don't leave the building.

1095
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,053
No, I'll wait for him
to come back.

1096
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:40,808
Will you ask her?

1097
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:45,271
She'll think
it's because she bailed me out.

1098
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:47,231
So let her...

1099
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:51,527
Dad... please.

1100
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,239
OK.

1101
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:56,908
Promise.

1102
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,871
Why do you promise?

1103
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,212
Dad...

1104
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:11,380
Yes?

1105
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,426
You didn't know
Razieh was pregnant?

1106
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:18,679
No.

1107
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,017
Why?

1108
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:24,477
Nothing.

1109
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:27,146
So why did you ask?

1110
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,565
Last night,
mum said you knew.

1111
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:33,903
Where was she to see
if I knew?

1112
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:37,990
She said when you were told
that Razieh's baby had died,

1113
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:39,825
you didn't say anything.

1114
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,411
You didn't ask if she was pregnant.

1115
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,372
You didn't get surprised.

1116
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:49,585
At times like this, people usually ask
if she was carrying a child.

1117
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,796
It was like you knew.

1118
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,844
Your mum wants
to turn you against me.

1119
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:16,529
Will you ask her?

1120
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,714
I can't.

1121
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:19,634
Didn't you promise?

1122
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,013
I'm sorry.

1123
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:36,275
Which step was she on?

1124
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,277
This one.

1125
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,571
- This?
- This one.

1126
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,793
Take grandpa in.
I'll be right back.

1127
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:31,122
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

1128
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:36,752
You went upstairs?

1129
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:39,463
Yes, I went to see Mrs Kalani.

1130
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,340
What for?

1131
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:44,802
I told her they are coming to investigate.
To beware.

1132
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:46,971
Beware of what?

1133
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,059
Beware of...

1134
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:55,104
that they are coming to investigate.

1135
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,606
Is that not OK?

1136
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,694
If she is to tell the truth,
why should she beware?

1137
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:10,453
Termeh...

1138
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:11,620
Yes?

1139
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:12,830
Come with me.

1140
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:16,751
- I have homework.
- Leave it for now.

1141
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:19,712
Look, imagine that I am her.

1142
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:24,633
Is this right?

1143
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:29,388
When someone is thrown
they fall straight.

1144
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,766
They don't hit here and bounce off

1145
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,519
and hit here and then turn
and hit here and fall here.

1146
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:36,854
Right?

1147
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,565
If I'd thrown her from there

1148
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:42,276
she should've fallen there on those steps

1149
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:45,780
or she would fall straight on the railing.

1150
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,115
She wouldn't fall like this.

1151
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:50,576
lmagine you were thrown.
Follow the direction.

1152
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:53,871
- Then how had she fallen there?
- I don't know.

1153
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:56,624
I'm just saying
she wasn't thrown on these steps.

1154
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,292
Come and stand here.

1155
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:01,837
- Why don't you tell them?
- Forget them.

1156
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,715
I want you to know.
Go on.

1157
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,398
Did he throw you in this direction?

1158
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,567
No, towards the lower level.

1159
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:24,985
You look.

1160
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:28,364
This door doesn't allow me to
even if I want to. It's not possible.

1161
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,907
Where did you fall down?

1162
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,827
- On these stairs.
- Which step?

1163
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,578
I think it was this one.

1164
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:35,996
You think
or you're sure?

1165
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,415
I'm not sure.

1166
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,459
Ma'am, this is where you found her?

1167
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,795
I didn't see her fall.

1168
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:45,422
When I got here,
she was on that lower step.

1169
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,299
Why don't you say anything?

1170
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,093
Go show them how he threw you.

1171
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:51,387
I was so sick
I didn't know what happened to me.

1172
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:54,223
Look, I'll stand in her place.

1173
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:58,853
You in the doorway
and push me as hard as you want.

1174
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,771
I'm saying
it's not possible to fall there.

1175
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,023
Of course you won't fall.

1176
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:04,942
A pregnant woman falls easily.

1177
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:08,487
Then you come here.
You choose who pushes you.

1178
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:10,447
I'm saying it's not possible.

1179
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:13,742
I'm saying if you push from here,
she won't fall on the stairs.

1180
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,495
What stairs? She says
she fell on that step up there.

1181
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:19,665
They all say
they saw her on that one.

1182
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:22,001
Ma'am, did you see her get thrown?

1183
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:24,712
From up there
I couldn't see the door

1184
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,881
but I saw the stairs
when she fell.

1185
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,258
Can you show me
where you were?

1186
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,510
Maybe she got dizzy and fell.

1187
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,929
How often did you use these stairs?

1188
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,723
Why hadn't she gotten dizzy?

1189
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:36,932
Excuse me.

1190
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:40,686
That morning when I saw her here
I asked her

1191
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:43,022
why there was garbage on the steps.

1192
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:46,734
She said she had gotten dizzy
and dropped the bag.

1193
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:47,902
Right?

1194
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:51,989
- She took the garbage down.
- You told me you got dizzy.

1195
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:55,492
Mrs Kalani, hadn't she mopped
the stairs that day?

1196
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,786
The stairs were wet.
Maybe she slipped.

1197
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,788
You jerk! You made her slip.

1198
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,248
Be respectful!

1199
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:03,208
I'm polite
in front of your family.

1200
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,669
You'd better be polite, you shit!

1201
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,004
Don't curse.

1202
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,672
Take him outside.

1203
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:12,426
Would his neighbours say
anything against him?

1204
01:22:12,552 --> 01:22:14,470
If you can prove they're lying...

1205
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:17,181
So you think
they're telling the truth?

1206
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:21,477
To hell with me
for wasting my time here.

1207
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,020
Excuse me.

1208
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:25,022
Give us her backpack.

1209
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:37,701
Here it is...

1210
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:50,839
Don't you want your drawing book?

1211
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:55,177
Sweetie, don't be upset

1212
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:58,055
that I am fighting
with your mum and dad...

1213
01:22:58,181 --> 01:23:00,057
Let me put it in your bag.

1214
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:10,985
My mummy didn't take your money.

1215
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:12,653
I know.

1216
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,198
That's not why I was fighting with her.

1217
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:20,244
Then for what?

1218
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:24,415
I was upset because she left my dad.

1219
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:29,753
She went to the doctor's.

1220
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,260
Go on.

1221
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:39,054
Take care.

1222
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:43,058
According to the court's request,
I'll examine him and write what I see.

1223
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:47,021
Well, doctor, you can see
he doesn't talk anymore.

1224
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,981
Didn't you say
he has Alzheimer's?

1225
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:52,526
Yes but before this happened,
he would speak a bit.

1226
01:23:52,652 --> 01:23:54,194
This is a doctor's office.

1227
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,363
Prove that in court.

1228
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,365
Does he have any bruising?

1229
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:00,576
Yes, some.

1230
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:38,530
What happened?

1231
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:43,535
I'm not sure the bruising has to do
with when he fell off the bed.

1232
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,303
Don't run.

1233
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:04,139
Mum, pull the window down.
They're fighting.

1234
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,558
Don't you see this is a girl's school?

1235
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:08,894
I just have one question for this lady.

1236
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,271
You're not allowed to stand here.

1237
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,485
Take your fight to the police.

1238
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,737
I don't want to fight.
I just want to speak to her.

1239
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:22,866
I have nothing to say to you.
I don't know you or her husband.

1240
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:25,577
- Then why did you lie in court?
- What lie?

1241
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:26,745
She knows what lie.

1242
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:28,956
Ms Safaei, call the police.

1243
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,333
Don't scare me with the police.

1244
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,377
She's not involved.

1245
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:35,921
Then why does she try
to get my daughter to speak?

1246
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,131
I did no such thing.

1247
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,759
You are a teacher.
Aren't you ashamed?

1248
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:43,470
Why did you ask her
if I hit her mum

1249
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:44,429
and she lost the baby?

1250
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:45,389
I never did.

1251
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,766
You pick on a 4-year-old's drawing

1252
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:51,061
and tell her her dad hit her mum
and she lost the baby?

1253
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:52,396
I didn't say that!

1254
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:56,692
Why do you think we beat our wives
and children like animals?

1255
01:25:56,818 --> 01:26:00,529
I swear on this Qoran,
we're humans just like you.

1256
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:10,080
I have nothing to lose.

1257
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:14,168
Tell your husband
not to make me do something crazy.

1258
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,336
I'll wait by the door.

1259
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:20,757
I'm unemployed.

1260
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,552
I'll stand out there all day.
Eventually you'll come out.

1261
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,220
Come to the court
and say you lied

1262
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:28,432
or I'll get to the bottom
of what's between you and her husband.

1263
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:31,476
Shame on you.
I've been patient so far.

1264
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,020
So why are you defending him?

1265
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:36,106
I told the truth.

1266
01:26:36,232 --> 01:26:37,357
- The truth?
- Yes!

1267
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:40,485
Place your hand on this and swear.

1268
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,529
Why swear?
What does this have to do with her?

1269
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:44,948
I'm not scared.
What do I have to say?

1270
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:48,660
You said her husband didn't know
my wife was pregnant.

1271
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:50,162
- Yes.
- Swear it.

1272
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:53,040
I swear on this Qoran
that day at their house,

1273
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:57,127
her husband was in the kitchen
and didn't hear what your wife and I said.

1274
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:01,465
OK?
Anything else I should say?

1275
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,221
He's crazy.

1276
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,726
Call your husband.
Don't go alone.

1277
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:15,562
No, I don't want him to know.
I'm sorry.

1278
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:18,273
Why are you all standing here?

1279
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:21,151
Hello?

1280
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,821
Hello, Ms Qahraei.

1281
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:28,367
I had left you a message.

1282
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,911
Can you please pick up?

1283
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,378
The lady that took care of my dad,

1284
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:43,423
apparently that day you gave her
the number for a gynaecologist.

1285
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:46,802
I wanted to ask you
for that number to call

1286
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:50,389
and see if she went
to see the doctor that week

1287
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,183
and what her problem was.

1288
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:56,520
I would appreciate
you calling me back. Thank you.

1289
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,079
What do you want to do?

1290
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:17,082
With what?

1291
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,252
You want to keep this up?
Everyday a new fight?

1292
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,212
Why? What happened?

1293
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:23,880
He went to her school today

1294
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:26,216
and embarrassed her
in front of everyone.

1295
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:30,512
What did he say?

1296
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:35,267
He screamed
"Her dad killed my child."

1297
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,563
How can she go back to that school?

1298
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:43,150
Do you know what you are doing?

1299
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:44,568
What I am doing?

1300
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:49,990
He's making threats.

1301
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,992
He wouldn't dare!

1302
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,203
Termeh, go to your room.

1303
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:04,087
What if he kills your child
on her way to school?

1304
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,007
What would you have me do?

1305
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:08,675
Run off abroad with you?

1306
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:12,137
To hell with abroad.
Why can't you talk normally?

1307
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:13,972
This is about Termeh

1308
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:16,391
and the situation you've put her in.

1309
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:18,477
I've put her in?

1310
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,271
You have some nerve accusing me!

1311
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:22,773
Who left home?

1312
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,566
Who filed for a divorce?

1313
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:25,984
You said
leave whenever you want.

1314
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:27,903
Why did you come back?

1315
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,197
I didn't.
I'm here because of her situation.

1316
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:31,281
Her situation's fine.

1317
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:34,743
- You have two choices...
- Don't try to intimidate me.

1318
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,036
What intimidation?

1319
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,955
Either you clear up the situation...

1320
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:41,333
- No, I know what to do.
- Didn't you hit her?

1321
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:43,960
Didn't she fall?
Didn't her baby die?

1322
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:46,171
Yes! I killed her child.

1323
01:29:46,297 --> 01:29:49,383
Why are you so stubborn?
Pay the blood money and end it.

1324
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,676
- I won't be forced into paying.
- Why forced?

1325
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:53,095
Put yourself in their place.

1326
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:56,306
- I'm not responsible for their troubles.
- Their child died!

1327
01:29:56,432 --> 01:30:00,811
And my dad has been hurt.
He doesn't even speak anymore.

1328
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:03,772
He didn't speak much before.

1329
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:06,775
I was happy
with the few words he spoke.

1330
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,443
Is it as bad as losing a baby?

1331
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,488
Where were you
to see I caused it?

1332
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:15,075
- Then how did she lose it?
- I don't know.

1333
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:18,995
There might be a chance
that her husband did something

1334
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:22,165
and now she wants to blame me.

1335
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:25,168
Her child said that day
she had gone to the doctor.

1336
01:30:25,294 --> 01:30:28,880
Why couldn't she wait two hours
to go to the doctor?

1337
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:31,466
Why did she tie the old man
to his bed and leave?

1338
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,885
The examiner said
her child died due to a blow.

1339
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:36,972
How do we know
it was a blow from me?

1340
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:41,059
I won't accept it
till it's been proven to me.

1341
01:30:42,728 --> 01:30:45,564
Fine, let me take Termeh.

1342
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:49,192
Shame on you
for putting pressure on me now.

1343
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:50,402
I am worried about her.

1344
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:53,530
Your child wants to live here.
She has to stay here and learn.

1345
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:56,074
Learn what?
Fighting and obstinacy?

1346
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,743
To learn not to be a coward like you

1347
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,538
who gives in so easily.

1348
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:04,749
He knows who to frighten.
Why doesn't he threaten me?

1349
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:05,876
Yes, I'm a coward.

1350
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:10,046
Your whole life,

1351
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,549
instead of solving problems,

1352
01:31:12,675 --> 01:31:17,512
you've either run away
or raised your hands and given in.

1353
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:21,308
Just say why you want
to leave this country.

1354
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:23,101
You're afraid to stay.

1355
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:26,229
I was gone one week
and you couldn't manage.

1356
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:28,482
I couldn't manage
and I'm responsible.

1357
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:33,570
Give me Termeh
and you do what you want.

1358
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,408
Termeh, sweetie,
you don't have to stay.

1359
01:31:38,534 --> 01:31:40,869
Go wherever you like.

1360
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,751
You still don't want to come?

1361
01:31:58,554 --> 01:32:00,388
"He sells it for twenty a kilo.

1362
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:04,559
"If everyday he sells 270 kilos..."
Write 270.

1363
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:10,941
Then, how much profit
does he make in one day?

1364
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:14,194
How do you solve this?

1365
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,238
Did you lie?

1366
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:19,157
What?

1367
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:21,409
Did you lie?

1368
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,663
About what?

1369
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:29,918
When you said
you didn't know she was pregnant.

1370
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:32,587
Why?

1371
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:36,716
You said that you didn't hear
Ms Qahraei

1372
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:38,677
and Razieh speaking.

1373
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:39,928
Yes.

1374
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:45,684
Then how did you know
that Ms Qahraei gave her the number?

1375
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,770
Didn't she say it at the same time?

1376
01:32:57,029 --> 01:32:58,572
OK.

1377
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:03,034
If we want to calculate the profit...

1378
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:09,958
Yes, I knew.

1379
01:33:12,628 --> 01:33:15,046
Your mum was telling the truth.

1380
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:20,343
When they were talking in the hall,
I heard everything

1381
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:22,012
from the kitchen.

1382
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:25,307
Then why did you say
you didn't?

1383
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:32,314
Do you know what would happen
if I said I knew?

1384
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:38,153
One to three years in prison.

1385
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:42,741
I only thought
of what would happen to you...

1386
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,201
who you'd stay with.

1387
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:48,246
I said I didn't know.

1388
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,751
If you knew, why did you hit her?

1389
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:56,755
I knew she was pregnant
but at that moment I didn't.

1390
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,633
I had forgotten it.
I wasn't paying attention.

1391
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:08,058
So tell them this.

1392
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:14,648
The law doesn't care about this.

1393
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:17,525
Either I knew or I didn't...

1394
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:25,909
Look at me.

1395
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:29,663
If you want me to
I'll tell them.

1396
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,592
Hi.

1397
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:32,350
Didn't I say
not to come to the front?

1398
01:35:52,955 --> 01:35:54,497
Ms Qahraei!

1399
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,010
What are you doing?

1400
01:36:07,636 --> 01:36:09,929
Ms Qahraei, wait...

1401
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:15,018
If you pull over
I'll just explain something to you.

1402
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:17,312
Please let me...

1403
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,314
Dad!

1404
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:24,444
Who's responsible
for my child's safety now?

1405
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,362
Without a witness there's no case.

1406
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:29,616
So without a witness
I should wait for him to kill her

1407
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:31,201
and then come to you?

1408
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:33,787
How should I know
you are telling the truth?

1409
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,705
Why should I lie?

1410
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:39,000
Bring my daughter and father here
just to lie?

1411
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:40,460
Is she here now?

1412
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:41,628
Yes, outside.

1413
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,755
Ask her yourself.

1414
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:48,676
I'm afraid to leave her at school.
I'm afraid to leave my dad at home.

1415
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,553
Is the plaintiff here?

1416
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:53,181
Did you finish writing?

1417
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,682
Almost.

1418
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:57,143
You didn't know
his wife was pregnant?

1419
01:36:57,269 --> 01:36:58,853
No, I didn't.

1420
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:02,232
When she was speaking to the tutor,
you didn't hear them?

1421
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:03,441
No, I didn't.

1422
01:37:04,693 --> 01:37:06,486
You didn't, huh?

1423
01:37:06,612 --> 01:37:08,696
What I'm saying is...

1424
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,366
The tutor came
and revoked her testimony.

1425
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:14,160
She says you knew.

1426
01:37:14,286 --> 01:37:16,663
- She said I knew?
- Yes, she came yesterday.

1427
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,331
He threatened her...

1428
01:37:18,457 --> 01:37:20,750
Answer me.
Did you hear her or not?

1429
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:22,418
I said no.

1430
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:24,546
How did you know
about the doctor's number?

1431
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,214
My daughter told me.

1432
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,382
What did she tell you?

1433
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:30,009
That she got the number
from her teacher.

1434
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,137
Go tell her to come in.

1435
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:36,224
Now?

1436
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,351
And wait outside.

1437
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:40,353
What question?

1438
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:46,860
What does he want to ask?

1439
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:51,739
I don't know.
Give me that.

1440
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:01,291
So what do you have to say?

1441
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:02,959
You haven't asked me anything.

1442
01:38:03,794 --> 01:38:06,296
Didn't your dad tell you
what I want to ask you?

1443
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:07,589
No.

1444
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,048
What grade are you in school?

1445
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:10,884
Sixth.

1446
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:14,387
The day your tutor came to your house

1447
01:38:14,513 --> 01:38:17,390
and asked the lady
about her pregnancy,

1448
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:19,893
were you there?

1449
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:23,938
Not then, I had gone to get my books.

1450
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:25,565
Then how did you know

1451
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:29,861
she got the doctor's number
from your tutor?

1452
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:33,448
She gave her the number later,
when she was leaving.

1453
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:34,824
In front of you?

1454
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:36,242
Yes.

1455
01:38:36,368 --> 01:38:37,952
Why didn't you tell
your dad sooner?

1456
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:39,412
What?

1457
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:43,166
That she got the doctor's number
from your tutor.

1458
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:46,294
I didn't think it was important
for my dad to know.

1459
01:38:48,797 --> 01:38:51,299
And did you tell your dad
or did he hear it?

1460
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:55,845
That she gave the number?
I told him.

1461
01:38:55,971 --> 01:38:57,263
You told him?

1462
01:38:57,389 --> 01:38:58,473
Yes.

1463
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:01,809
OK.

1464
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,362
What crime did I commit?

1465
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:55,697
Nothing. You're right.

1466
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,616
He's not accepting his responsibility.

1467
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:01,869
I admit that he's to blame
but in the end what will happen?

1468
01:40:01,996 --> 01:40:06,624
One or two years in court
for a payment plan of the blood money.

1469
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,085
But why?
That's what upsets me.

1470
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:11,129
Why do you think
it's for the money?

1471
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:12,547
When did I say such a thing?

1472
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:15,717
You think I am a bum
and my kid died

1473
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,427
and I don't understand anything.

1474
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,220
I never said anything like that.

1475
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:21,014
Let's see what she's saying.

1476
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,432
There's no other way.

1477
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:25,435
Your child won't come back.

1478
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:27,603
My husband won't get hanged.

1479
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:30,106
Her husband didn't do it on purpose.

1480
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:34,110
They're good people
for giving you a solution.

1481
01:40:34,236 --> 01:40:37,613
Take the money and settle it.
You can use it in your situation.

1482
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:41,951
Right now we'll decide on an amount
and I'll get my husband's approval.

1483
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:47,123
Now we have to get his approval?
For God's sake leave us alone.

1484
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:52,462
You act like you don't need the money.

1485
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:53,921
Take a look at yourself.

1486
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:55,923
Don't let him go.

1487
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:02,305
Wait a second.
I want to talk to you.

1488
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,023
Will you stay?

1489
01:41:56,568 --> 01:41:58,111
Mum...

1490
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:02,365
Let me speak to him.

1491
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:14,252
Come sit.
I want to talk to you.

1492
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:18,714
I can hear you.

1493
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:23,427
I went and spoke to her husband today.

1494
01:42:24,096 --> 01:42:25,847
Sit down.

1495
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:37,733
I managed

1496
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:40,444
to get him to agree

1497
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:43,114
to take fifteen million
instead of forty million.

1498
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:46,617
Three five-million checks
in exchange for his consent.

1499
01:42:46,743 --> 01:42:48,494
How dare you speak to him
about money?

1500
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,164
I can't handle the stress
of my child's safety.

1501
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,999
You don't get it.

1502
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:55,918
Just now when you were late,
I was worried sick.

1503
01:42:56,044 --> 01:42:58,796
Why are you interfering?

1504
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:01,507
I didn't come here to fight.

1505
01:43:01,633 --> 01:43:03,676
Oh God,
why can't I make her understand?

1506
01:43:03,802 --> 01:43:07,471
Didn't you say it was my fault,
that I introduced her,

1507
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:10,725
that if I hadn't left,
none of this would've happened?

1508
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:12,643
So let me fix it then.

1509
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:16,063
If I pay, it means
I have accepted it was my fault.

1510
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,148
But he has consented.

1511
01:43:17,274 --> 01:43:18,816
He won't let us be.

1512
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:21,652
- He won't, anyway.
- Why should I bribe him?

1513
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:23,362
Think of it
as my dower money.

1514
01:43:24,072 --> 01:43:27,450
If I had to
I would beg and borrow

1515
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:29,619
to get your dower money.

1516
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:32,580
But I don't have the money
to pay for extortion.

1517
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:36,375
Our child is going through adolescence.
She is suffering.

1518
01:43:36,501 --> 01:43:42,840
So you understand
the sensitivity of her adolescence.

1519
01:43:42,966 --> 01:43:44,926
If she was suffering
she wouldn't have stayed.

1520
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:47,803
Why do you think she stayed?

1521
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:49,972
Did she choose you?

1522
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:53,434
To keep us from separating.

1523
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:58,731
She knows I won't go anywhere
without her.

1524
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:02,860
She is suffering
but she doesn't show it.

1525
01:44:07,282 --> 01:44:09,909
Call them now and say
I won't pay

1526
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:13,079
until it's been proved to me
that I am responsible.

1527
01:44:13,205 --> 01:44:15,623
I'll sell my car.

1528
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:17,458
Don't sell it for my sake.

1529
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:19,126
It's not for you.

1530
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:21,462
If your child is not worth...

1531
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:24,632
Why are you talking nonsense?
Money's not the issue.

1532
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:28,052
I won't rest till my child's safety
is guaranteed.

1533
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:30,930
You don't have the right
to do anything.

1534
01:44:31,056 --> 01:44:32,515
Understand?

1535
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:36,018
If I had done nothing
you would be in prison.

1536
01:44:39,856 --> 01:44:42,817
Come to court
and get back the bail.

1537
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:45,528
I don't want to be out
because of it.

1538
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,132
Get up, Termeh.

1539
01:45:06,258 --> 01:45:07,466
Get up, let's go.

1540
01:45:07,592 --> 01:45:09,051
Get up, I tell you.

1541
01:45:09,177 --> 01:45:10,720
Mum, please.

1542
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:14,557
I don't want you to stay here.

1543
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:16,100
No, Mum, I won't let you.

1544
01:45:16,226 --> 01:45:20,104
Is fifteen million more important
than your child's life?

1545
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:21,731
I won't let you do this.

1546
01:45:21,857 --> 01:45:23,441
If your child is not important...

1547
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:26,444
Mum, please listen,
why are you doing this?

1548
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:27,987
You said you would stay.

1549
01:45:28,113 --> 01:45:31,282
I was stupid!

1550
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:33,075
Mum, please...

1551
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:35,286
I'll wait in the car.

1552
01:45:45,547 --> 01:45:49,508
Go there for a few days
till your exams are finished.

1553
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:51,927
Your grandparents are there.

1554
01:45:52,804 --> 01:45:54,430
You'll have more fun.

1555
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:56,474
Didn't you say
it's not serious?

1556
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,477
It got serious.

1557
01:46:00,645 --> 01:46:02,355
Termeh...

1558
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,106
Honey...

1559
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:07,943
If you cry I'll cry too.

1560
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:10,363
Why won't you pay them
so she'll come back?

1561
01:46:10,489 --> 01:46:13,491
This has nothing to do
with her coming back.

1562
01:46:13,617 --> 01:46:15,951
It does.
She had come to stay.

1563
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:18,913
Her stuff was in the car,
I saw it.

1564
01:46:58,954 --> 01:47:00,704
If you think I am guilty

1565
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:02,373
go get your mum.

1566
01:47:02,499 --> 01:47:05,334
We'll call them and go pay them.

1567
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:23,496
I have doubts.

1568
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:25,789
Didn't he throw you?

1569
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:27,458
Yes.

1570
01:48:28,043 --> 01:48:30,544
Did something happen at home?

1571
01:48:31,546 --> 01:48:33,506
No. Even before,
my child wasn't moving.

1572
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:36,759
Before he threw you?

1573
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:45,809
You mean
your child had already died?

1574
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:48,270
I don't know. Maybe.

1575
01:48:48,396 --> 01:48:50,481
Had something happened?

1576
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:56,028
I'm not sure but...
the night before, I had pain.

1577
01:48:57,614 --> 01:49:00,074
- Have you ever lost a baby before?
- No.

1578
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:04,787
I was hit by a car.

1579
01:49:12,045 --> 01:49:15,589
You father-in-law
had gone into the street.

1580
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:17,591
I went after him.

1581
01:49:18,343 --> 01:49:20,928
He was crossing the street
to come back.

1582
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:25,099
I ran to stop him
but I got hit instead.

1583
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:28,102
The pain started that night.

1584
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:32,314
Does your husband know this?

1585
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:36,694
Why don't you come say this
in court?

1586
01:49:39,322 --> 01:49:43,534
My husband will kill me
if he finds out I told you this.

1587
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:47,788
Since yesterday
when he promised his creditors,

1588
01:49:47,914 --> 01:49:49,290
he's been waiting.

1589
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:54,169
What do we have to do
with all this?

1590
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:59,258
It's my fault.

1591
01:50:03,013 --> 01:50:06,932
Yesterday when he said
you've promised him this money,

1592
01:50:07,058 --> 01:50:10,102
I got really scared.
I called a few people.

1593
01:50:10,228 --> 01:50:12,980
They say if I have doubts
then it's a sin to take it.

1594
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:17,318
If we don't pay
my husband's innocence must be proved.

1595
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:21,238
I made you swear
not to repeat any of this!

1596
01:50:21,364 --> 01:50:23,574
But your husband
won't leave us alone.

1597
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:25,451
I fear for my child.

1598
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:27,786
I'm afraid
that if I take this money

1599
01:50:27,912 --> 01:50:30,164
something will happen to my child.

1600
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:32,082
What do you want me to do?

1601
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:35,502
Don't pay this money.

1602
01:50:36,588 --> 01:50:37,630
Don't.

1603
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:47,681
Will your husband leave us alone?

1604
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:23,842
Give me that.
Bring some plates.

1605
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,304
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen.

1606
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:51,161
When you revoke your complaint,

1607
01:51:51,287 --> 01:51:54,373
we'll give you these three checks.

1608
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:55,582
God bless you.

1609
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:58,210
Hojjat, get a pen and paper

1610
01:51:58,336 --> 01:52:01,338
so we can write everything down
and sign it.

1611
01:52:01,464 --> 01:52:03,465
I want to say something first...

1612
01:52:03,591 --> 01:52:05,509
Say a prayer and finish it.

1613
01:52:05,635 --> 01:52:08,887
I have already agreed
and will honour my word.

1614
01:52:09,013 --> 01:52:12,099
I just want his wife
and my daughter to be here

1615
01:52:12,225 --> 01:52:14,518
when I speak.

1616
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,439
Where is she?

1617
01:52:20,608 --> 01:52:21,984
Thank you.

1618
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:24,445
Please, also call my daughter.

1619
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:31,201
Come in. Your father wants you.

1620
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,963
Termeh, come and sit here.

1621
01:52:43,089 --> 01:52:45,132
Excuse me, sir.

1622
01:52:55,685 --> 01:52:57,227
Look...

1623
01:52:57,353 --> 01:53:00,689
I wrote the checks
and I'll give them to you.

1624
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:02,816
There's no problem.

1625
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:04,234
I need to ask a favour.

1626
01:53:05,695 --> 01:53:08,363
Ma'am, you are a devout person.

1627
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:12,993
Swear on the Qoran
that I caused your miscarriage.

1628
01:53:21,836 --> 01:53:23,796
Bring a Qoran.

1629
01:53:23,922 --> 01:53:25,464
Go get it.

1630
01:53:42,732 --> 01:53:45,609
Come quickly
or they'll suspect something.

1631
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:49,279
His creditors are here for the money.

1632
01:53:49,405 --> 01:53:51,490
You'll ruin our reputation.

1633
01:53:53,493 --> 01:53:55,369
I won't swear.

1634
01:53:56,913 --> 01:54:01,083
Didn't you say you went to get his father
and a car hit you?

1635
01:54:02,502 --> 01:54:04,378
Why aren't you coming?

1636
01:54:05,296 --> 01:54:07,172
She's afraid to swear.

1637
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:09,466
Why?

1638
01:54:09,592 --> 01:54:13,262
I... I have doubts.

1639
01:54:19,143 --> 01:54:20,644
Oh God...

1640
01:54:22,063 --> 01:54:24,147
Azam, go sit with them.

1641
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:31,488
Why are you saying this now?

1642
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:34,408
I swear I told Azam.

1643
01:54:35,743 --> 01:54:38,412
Tell me exactly what happened.

1644
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:44,710
The day before, a car hit me.

1645
01:54:44,836 --> 01:54:47,754
And that night I had a lot of pain.

1646
01:54:57,432 --> 01:55:00,392
- Let's go, it'll be my sin.
- No.

1647
01:55:00,518 --> 01:55:01,894
It's a sin. I asked.

1648
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:04,980
What sin? He's consented.
Let's go.

1649
01:55:05,106 --> 01:55:07,649
I am scared we'll be punished.

1650
01:55:07,775 --> 01:55:11,403
More punished than this?
Look at my situation.

1651
01:55:11,529 --> 01:55:15,198
Have mercy on me.
On our child.

1652
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:19,369
I'm afraid of something happening
to our child.

1653
01:55:19,495 --> 01:55:20,746
Let's go.

1654
01:55:20,872 --> 01:55:22,039
I can't.

1655
01:55:22,165 --> 01:55:23,665
Let's go.

1656
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:28,170
I can't.

1657
01:55:32,258 --> 01:55:34,676
Don't hit yourself!

1658
01:55:53,905 --> 01:55:57,699
Why did you come here tonight?
Didn't I tell you not to come?

1659
01:55:58,451 --> 01:56:00,661
Didn't I say
we don't want your money?

1660
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:03,664
How will I live in this house?

1661
01:56:04,749 --> 01:56:07,626
Why did you do this to me?

1662
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:36,256
Come on.

1663
01:57:41,095 --> 01:57:42,637
Let's go.

1664
01:57:58,654 --> 01:58:00,197
Hello. Come in.

1665
01:58:10,083 --> 01:58:12,417
So what's your decision?

1666
01:58:12,543 --> 01:58:17,839
Your parents have left it up to you
to decide who you want to live with.

1667
01:58:17,965 --> 01:58:20,842
With your father or your mother?

1668
01:58:21,969 --> 01:58:23,512
Have you decided?

1669
01:58:23,638 --> 01:58:25,097
Yes.

1670
01:58:25,223 --> 01:58:27,307
- Have you?
- Yes.

1671
01:58:37,819 --> 01:58:39,486
Have you decided or not?

1672
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:41,154
Yes.

1673
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:44,658
And what is it?

1674
01:58:46,577 --> 01:58:48,453
Do I have to say it now?

1675
01:58:49,622 --> 01:58:52,749
- If you haven't decided...
- Yes, I have.

1676
01:58:57,046 --> 01:58:59,381
- If you haven't decided yet...
- I have.

1677
01:58:59,507 --> 01:59:00,549
And?

1678
01:59:01,926 --> 01:59:05,512
Would you prefer them
to wait outside?

1679
01:59:05,638 --> 01:59:07,556
Can they?

1680
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:10,684
Sir, wait outside for a minute.

1681
01:59:12,645 --> 01:59:13,895
You too, ma'am.
