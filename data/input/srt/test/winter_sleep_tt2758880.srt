1
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,908
Good morning. Had your breakfast?

2
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,826
Good morning. Yes, thanks.

3
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,536
I gathered some mushrooms.

4
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,785
Would you like some fried?

5
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,919
No thanks. Really. I'm full.

6
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,411
Thanks.

7
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,299
Fine. Have a nice day.

8
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,747
By the way...

9
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,552
do you keep horses at this hotel?

10
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,299
No, no horses.

11
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,677
You don't?

12
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,307
I saw horses on your website.

13
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:10,807
True, there are lots of wild horses
around here.

14
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,306
I mean...

15
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,560
it's just to decorate the website.

16
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,518
I see.

17
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,363
Good morning, Mr Aydin.

18
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,611
- Where on earth were you?
- I'm here.

19
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,618
The client wants his breakfast,
and there's nobody here.

20
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,989
Where's Hidayet?

21
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,745
Here somewhere.

22
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,836
Shall I make your coffee, Mr Aydin?

23
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,086
Shall I make your coffee?

24
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,802
I gathered mushrooms.

25
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,843
Oh, where did you find them?

26
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,426
Is Nihal up yet?

27
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,605
Mrs Nihal got up early
and had breakfast already.

28
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,563
Is she in her room?

29
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,151
I don't know. I suppose so.

30
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,159
Is Necla up?

31
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,408
Mrs Necla hasn't come down yet.

32
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,790
I see.

33
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,336
Bring the coffee to my study.

34
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:46,219
WINTER SLEEP

35
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,493
- Will the dogs attack us?
- No, don't worry.

36
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,744
Ekrem!

37
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,384
Ekrem!

38
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,405
The horse I'll catch for you

39
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,608
is the toughest breed in Turkey.

40
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,533
Come on, we saw them for 600.

41
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,991
But how old are they?

42
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,998
Are their legs OK? Their tendons?

43
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,289
Any lung or heart problems?

44
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,037
You don't know anything.

45
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,960
You'll go and buy one, then be sorry.

46
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,631
You'll pay 500, then sell it for 300.

47
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,507
I'll catch you a young, sturdy one.

48
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,558
He'll be your friend for life.

49
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,887
Isn't that perfect?

50
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,719
- The color?
- You can choose.

51
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,223
There's a choice.

52
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:22,809
Just let me check its hooves
to make sure it's sturdy.

53
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,107
Two years ago, I caught a horse.

54
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,145
I entered it in the Jockey Club
endurance race.

55
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,689
It won the 80km event.

56
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,240
The guys said it was
as small as a donkey.

57
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,282
"But donkeys lead camels",
I told them.

58
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,331
That's our Anatolian horses.

59
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,371
I finished 45 minutes
before the rest.

60
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,538
- 45 minutes!
- 27 horses started.

61
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,592
These are our ancestors' horses,
fine, hardy beasts.

62
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,552
So when can we do it?

63
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,298
When I have time
and the weather's fine.

64
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,101
This coming week?

65
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,348
If the mud dries.

66
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,435
I'll let you know.

67
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,203
Did the other one pay
after the warning?

68
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,530
No. Nothing.

69
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,242
The lawyer says we could evict him
in two months.

70
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,708
How?

71
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,712
The law protects the tenants.

72
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,964
They don't know all that.

73
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,972
I don't think
they will even hire a lawyer.

74
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:23,011
Sometimes,
I'm tempted to sell them all,

75
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,227
although they come from my father.

76
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,310
They think you're a bit soft.
That's why they behave like this.

77
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,361
Otherwise, there's no such thing
around here.

78
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,616
How dare they not pay rent?

79
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:42,911
Come on, Hidayet. What else can I do?

80
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,705
What's so soft about me?

81
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,663
We go to court.
What else can we do?

82
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,753
Well, Mr Aydin,

83
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,545
there are actually
lots of things to do.

84
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,216
Anyway...

85
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,313
Fucking bastard!

86
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,397
Come here, you!

87
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,013
Get up, you!

88
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,350
Keep still or I'll slap you.

89
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,680
- What happened?
- I caught him.

90
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,518
I mean, why is he soaked?

91
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,765
He fell in the water.

92
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,110
He tried to jump the stream
and slipped.

93
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,148
- Any bruises?
- No. He just got wet.

94
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,153
So why throw the stone?

95
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,448
Soaked like that,
best get him home quick

96
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,957
before he catches cold.
I'll explain later, Mr Aydin.

97
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,123
Alright.

98
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,220
Come on.

99
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,945
- I'll talk to them.
- Alright.

100
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,721
Hamdi hodja!

101
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:26,995
You get inside.

102
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,581
Hello.

103
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,411
Hello.

104
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,287
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

105
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,167
Your kid fell in the water.
We brought him back quick.

106
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,679
- Where, how?
- Near Issiz.

107
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,976
He slipped jumping the stream
and got wet.

108
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,854
What was he doing there?

109
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,019
He was hiding, waiting for our car.

110
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,768
He threw a stone
and broke our window.

111
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,027
We'd have crashed if I hadn't
managed to turn and brake.

112
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,119
- My son Ilyas?
- Yes.

113
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,532
- He broke your window with a stone?
- Yes. Go see for yourself.

114
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,168
How can such a little kid
break a window like that?

115
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,925
You know better than me, Ismail.
He's your son after all.

116
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,966
Stop bullshitting.

117
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,715
Say what you want.

118
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,008
Nothing to say.

119
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,980
The glass is there. You tell me.

120
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,651
It's no simple matter.

121
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,906
We nearly crashed, Ismail.
What do you except?

122
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,148
Am I wrong?

123
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,411
Anyway, we'll pay for it.

124
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,080
Look, it's not just about the money.

125
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,751
Call the kid and ask him
what got into him.

126
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,795
We asked him already,
but he wouldn't say.

127
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,885
We nearly died out there,
because of a shitty little stone.

128
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,882
It's no joke, Ismail.

129
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,556
Ilyas.

130
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,680
Come here!

131
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,948
Did you throw the stone, son?

132
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,505
Did you?

133
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,968
Ilyas!

134
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,550
Did you throw that stone?

135
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,315
Go now.

136
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,321
There was no need for that.

137
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,409
Don't go over the top.

138
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:58,739
But it's not so simple.
That's why I'm telling you.

139
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,874
Hidayet.

140
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,528
How's that? Happy?

141
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,996
Is that alright now?
Feel better?

142
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,115
A slap for a broken window.

143
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,254
Is that enough for you two?

144
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,873
Or should I call him back
for some more?

145
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,797
What's all this, Ismail?
What's happening?

146
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,505
Hidayet?

147
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,844
The kid fell in the water.
We brought him back.

148
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,058
But we shouldn't have bothered.

149
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,603
Our Ilyas broke their car window.

150
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,568
- He broke their window?
- Yes.

151
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,605
So they're here to make us pay.

152
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,188
Did I say that?

153
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,191
Didn't I say we brought him home
so he wouldn't get sick?

154
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,781
Cut it out.

155
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,831
You took our fridge and TV
for a lousy rent. Isn't that enough?

156
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,960
Now you're hassling a kid?

157
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,418
- Stop showing off, Ismail.
- What did you say?

158
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,462
- Don't bullshit me, Ismail.
- What bullshit?

159
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,296
Ismail, don't piss me off.

160
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,878
What the fuck?

161
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,140
- Whatever. Get lost.
- What the fuck did you say?

162
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,472
Stop bullshitting.

163
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,059
You come and hassle me at home.
Who the hell do you think you are?

164
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,511
I've no time for all this...

165
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,811
- Clear off, Hamdi. I'll fuck him up!
- Ismail!

166
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,025
Come here!
Come here, I'm telling you.

167
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,023
Don't make it any worse.

168
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,356
Ismail, I'm talking to you.

169
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,859
Let go.
I'll fuck him over right here.

170
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,527
Stop it!

171
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,873
I'll kill that fucker.

172
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,082
I'll fuck you up, son of a bitch.

173
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,543
Come on, throw it, you fucker.

174
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,789
- Stop cursing, son of a bitch!
- Get lost!

175
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,756
Leave it, Ismail. Get in.

176
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,838
Come here!

177
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,888
Fuck off.

178
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,640
Get him inside!

179
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,768
- Look at that bastard.
- Come on.

180
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,146
Letting a drunk provoke you.

181
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,642
But he kept cursing.

182
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,867
I'll go and see.

183
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,078
Fuck.

184
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,637
Hidayet, I'm really sorry.

185
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,228
I'm as shocked as you.
I don't know what to say.

186
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,475
What's going on, Hamdi?

187
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,734
What's all this show about?
It's beyond me.

188
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,318
He wouldn't dare act big
if you weren't here.

189
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,160
Well... the window's broken

190
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,070
and we'll pay for it.

191
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,819
We'll pay the rent
as soon we can, too.

192
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:30,411
We haven't forgotten. God willing,
I'll bring it all to you in person.

193
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,377
But we're having a hard time.

194
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,464
We're not here for that.
That's a different issue.

195
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,376
We always pay our debts.

196
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:42,629
Mr Aydin's late father knew us well.
With him, we never had any problems.

197
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,179
We got on well for years.

198
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,388
That's why you didn't have to do
what you did.

199
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,227
Wouldn't it be better
if we weren't disgraced?

200
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,484
Don't you agree?
We too have our pride.

201
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,938
For God's sake, Hamdi,
drop that talk.

202
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:04,193
We didn't say anything for months.
You'll start blaming us at this rate.

203
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,279
OK, Hidayet, come on.

204
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,871
But sending a debt collector
so suddenly, is that right?

205
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:13,411
You could have talked to us first.
Talking exists, doesn't it?

206
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,618
Come on, Hidayet.

207
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,629
How many times did we talk?
How many times did I tell you?

208
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,292
I did, didn't I?

209
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,799
A thousand times, Mr Aydin.

210
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,965
You'll talk about it later. Come on.

211
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,845
And I told you we'd sort it out.
Didn't I?

212
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,723
And did you sort it out?

213
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,771
Is it sorted out, Hamdi?

214
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:34,973
Forget it, it's OK.

215
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,024
My apologies again, Mr Aydin.

216
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,777
I myself will bring the money
for the window to your place.

217
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,317
OK, you'll talk about it later.

218
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,904
I'll settle it quickly.

219
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,529
I'll come whenever it suits you.

220
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,162
- Alright.
- Please, don't worry.

221
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,368
You waste your time with anybody.

222
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,499
Jerk. Scum of the earth.

223
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,709
- My apologies again.
- Who the hell are you?

224
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,462
OK, bye.

225
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,758
Have a good day.

226
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,734
Bastard. Son of a bitch.

227
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,286
Fatma.

228
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,120
Come here.

229
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,545
What's that?

230
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,758
Your dowry. What do you think?

231
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,256
Put them down.

232
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,920
Take these.

233
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,426
Leave them.

234
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,431
- Where shall I take them?
- Out back, to the terrace.

235
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,928
Careful, don't bump into anything.

236
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,600
Easy. Come on.

237
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,518
- Let me take it.
- I'm fine.

238
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,400
I'm off to get the window fixed.

239
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,861
- Alright.
- Anything else?

240
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,281
No.

241
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,368
Should I get a brand-name
or generic product?

242
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,376
Where'll you get a brand?

243
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:20,162
Nowhere. That's why I'm asking.

244
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,335
Huh?

245
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,796
Go on, Hidayet.

246
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,647
- Do we have guests?
- Levent the teacher is here.

247
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,401
- So they had tea?
- Yes, but they want coffee now.

248
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,243
Hello.

249
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,659
- How was your walk?
- Yeah, good.

250
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,078
- Do you need anything?
- No, thanks.

251
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,747
- Are you hungry?
- No. Thanks.

252
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,074
What are you doing?

253
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,490
Not much.

254
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,159
Here's a hot drink for my brother.

255
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,125
That's nice of you.

256
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,750
Who'd care for me,
if you weren't around?

257
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,923
- We're out of lime, so I made sage.
- Don't worry, it's fine.

258
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,428
Don't stop. I'll just flick through
some magazines.

259
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,261
Sure.

260
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,111
Are you writing your column?

261
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm trying to.

262
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,626
By the way, I read last week's.

263
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,209
I liked it.

264
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,587
Which one do you mean?

265
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:34,462
Urban ugliness in Anatolia.
Aesthetic deprivation and so on.

266
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,134
- Right.
- Bravo.

267
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:41,851
How do you come up with
interesting ideas every week?

268
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,517
Did you really like it?

269
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,152
It was good.

270
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,561
It's not about wealth and poverty.

271
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,814
Poverty existed in the past, too.

272
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,858
If you only have three olives,
you can place them nicely on a plate,

273
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,156
or gobble them
out of the plastic bag.

274
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,282
I know what you mean.

275
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,585
I told you we went to the hodja's?
You know, our tenant.

276
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,667
Yes?

277
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,171
If you saw how filthy it was,
how messy.

278
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,594
- Did you go in?
- No, I mean the garden.

279
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,841
They've ruined it.

280
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:19,175
A woman lives there too,
but you wouldn't think so.

281
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,015
First of all, you are a man of God.

282
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,557
You should be a model
to your community.

283
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,602
Shouldn't you be neat and tidy?

284
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,020
Who is he? Do I know him?

285
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,603
No, you wouldn't.

286
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,151
An old tenant
from back in my father's day.

287
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,992
I'd walk past him in the street.

288
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,821
Just a crooked, shabby guy.

289
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,451
I don't know...

290
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,291
Shouldn't men of God
be a model to the public?

291
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,588
Especially in rural areas.

292
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,634
Perhaps I should write about that
next week?

293
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,259
The very thought of him
gets on my nerves.

294
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,178
Of course, write about
anything you want.

295
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,930
But...

296
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,644
Wouldn't it be better to write
for a bigger paper

297
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,976
instead of a local one nobody reads?

298
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:15,942
Then at least it would be worth
all your efforts.

299
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,279
I don't feel I'm making any efforts.

300
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:25,663
I mean, I hear you typing away
in front of your computer all week.

301
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,874
That's why.

302
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,588
If you didn't bring me that paper,

303
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,257
I wouldn't even know it existed.

304
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,840
That's what I mean.

305
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,216
Frankly, I don't give a damn
about big papers.

306
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,975
My kingdom may be small
but at least I'm the king there.

307
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,271
I mean, who's going to read
this paper?

308
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,893
Who's going to buy it?

309
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,230
I don't agree with you,
my dear Necla.

310
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,280
On the contrary.

311
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,242
Sometimes I receive
letters from my readers

312
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,574
that prove to me
I'm on the right path.

313
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,664
Even my efforts, as you say,

314
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,160
feel more than worth it.

315
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,338
- Take yesterday...
- Yes but sometimes on the Internet,

316
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,544
some awful writers get praised
to high heaven.

317
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,168
Everyone has their fans somehow.

318
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,767
That's why I think one shouldn't
take such praise so seriously.

319
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,681
I mean, that shouldn't be
your reference.

320
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,318
Anyway, keep on writing.
Don't let me distract you.

321
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,236
I'll just lie down here.

322
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,367
In silence.

323
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,853
The mud makes driving up here hard.

324
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,146
Why don't you lay some gravel?

325
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,230
The tourists like it this way,
it's more natural.

326
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:22,240
I didn't say asphalt, I said gravel.
That's natural too.

327
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,326
With gravel,
half the tourists wouldn't come.

328
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,160
Very few clients in winter, in fact.
Wouldn't be worth it.

329
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,455
Of course nobody comes with this mud.

330
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,331
Don't want everyone here anyway.

331
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,077
I just want those who value
a natural setting.

332
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,923
Fancy a sprint?

333
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,290
- Fine.
- Good.

334
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,383
- Ready?
- Yes.

335
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,054
We're off!

336
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,264
Did you put on weight?

337
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,892
- What?
- You put on weight?

338
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,471
What weight, man?

339
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,100
My belly's declared independence.

340
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,937
- Be careful. Don't let yourself go.
- What if I did?

341
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,651
I've buried my wife.
I'm all alone.

342
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,987
It's you who should be worried.
With a young, beautiful wife.

343
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,746
If you don't look out, they'll be
asking if Nihal's your daughter.

344
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,699
Come on. I'm not that bad.

345
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,460
What about that mass suicide
around your hairline then?

346
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,841
It's no big deal, but...

347
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,593
You know that village, Garip,
near your farm...

348
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,506
Yes, but I've never been.

349
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,341
Whatever...

350
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:31,342
A girl from the public education
office wrote to me.

351
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,520
I don't usually care much
for that kind of thing.

352
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,263
But for some reason, I was touched.

353
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,850
Maybe I'm just getting old.

354
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:44,489
I wanted to ask you
whether I should take it seriously.

355
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,366
What's she after? A donation?

356
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:50,403
Nothing much, the main thing is...

357
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:51,613
Come in, Fatma.

358
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,954
I couldn't make out if she's sincere
or after something else.

359
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,251
Being a good judge of character,

360
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,542
you'll easily see
what's what from the letter.

361
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,706
I wanted to ask you.

362
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:06,377
- Where shall I put your tea?
- On the table's fine.

363
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,172
- Where is the letter?
- On the computer.

364
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,556
- Read it out then.
- Right, listen.

365
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,473
Thanks, Fatma.

366
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:25,190
Nihal loves charity like this.
Should we call her as well?

367
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,897
Go ahead. If you like.

368
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,653
- We should, shouldn't we?
- Yes.

369
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,371
I don't know if she's free.

370
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:43,961
Nihal?

371
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,667
Suavi's here,
we're discussing something.

372
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,131
I was wondering
if you're free to join us.

373
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,513
We need your opinion.

374
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,350
Yes, we're in my study.

375
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,263
Alright, dear.

376
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,856
- She's coming.
- Good.

377
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,818
Mr Suavi, how are you?

378
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,153
Fine, thanks, and you?

379
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,611
Fine, thank you.

380
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,411
It's been a long time.
Are you doing OK?

381
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,411
I'm fine. No problems.

382
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,543
I don't leave the farm anyway.

383
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,332
What problems could there be?

384
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,089
How are your activities doing?

385
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,925
As usual. The same old routine.

386
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,888
But tell me what's your secret

387
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,307
for looking younger
and more beautiful every time?

388
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,604
That's very kind of you.
Thanks very much.

389
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,898
How is your daughter?
Does she come to visit?

390
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,727
Well, you know...

391
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,186
She came once when she graduated.

392
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,397
And when we lost her mother.

393
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,854
That was it really.

394
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:52,025
- She's still in London?
- Yes.

395
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,286
Why don't you join her?
Why stay here all alone?

396
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,286
Me?

397
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,330
Heaven forbid.

398
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:02,586
I can't stand that English husband
saying "Oh lovely" to everything.

399
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,585
Just don't talk like that.

400
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,422
So, let me tell Nihal.
I was saying to Suavi

401
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,587
I got a letter the other day.

402
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:16,057
A young girl who teaches needlecraft
in a local village.

403
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,889
In short, she's asking for help.

404
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:22,681
I'm not sure how to respond,
so I thought I'd ask you two.

405
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,143
What kind of help does she want?

406
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,192
Actually, the letter is here.
Shall I read it?

407
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,063
Sure. Go ahead.

408
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,412
Alright then, I will.

409
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,243
Let me see.

410
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,089
Yes, here it is.

411
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,962
"Dear Mr Aydin,

412
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,378
I would like you to know that...

413
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,259
I am a great admirer of you
and your articles.

414
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,268
I'm always eager
to read your weekly column

415
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,559
in our local paper
"Voice of the Steppe",

416
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:06,356
impatient to benefit from your vast
experience and courageous ideas.

417
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,603
We, the teachers
at the Technical School for Girls,

418
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:14,315
are proud that our town
has such a valued citizen."

419
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,240
Blah, blah, we can skip all this.

420
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,035
Yes... let's continue from there.

421
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,497
"We, a group of teachers,

422
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,954
wanted to build
a small building in Garip,

423
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:31,585
one of the area's poorest villages
to teach crafts and writing

424
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,333
to the women of the village.

425
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:38,305
The mukhtar helped
as much as he could.

426
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,223
However, despite all our efforts,
our resources ran out

427
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,269
with the work not finished.

428
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,389
We applied for support to the
municipality, but we were rejected.

429
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,186
We have been left helpless, all alone
in the middle of this steppe,

430
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,902
with all our good intentions
and hopes.

431
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,451
While we sat disheartened
seeking a solution,

432
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,831
I suddenly remembered your article
"Flowers of the Steppes".

433
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,076
It felt as if you were describing us.

434
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:09,499
Me and my friends read
that article again in tears.

435
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,961
Believe me, my intention
is not emotional blackmail.

436
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:17,677
I want you to know
that I would never feel ashamed

437
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:22,141
to bow in front of a good person
like you to beg for help

438
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,604
for the unfortunate people
of these arid steppes

439
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,395
where I am proud to be born.

440
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,145
I'll be brief.

441
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,316
Since we heard about your connections
with the wealthy people of the region

442
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,200
and the administration,

443
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:45,196
and we know you are well connected,
even as far away as Istanbul,

444
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,700
we wanted to tell you
of our situation.

445
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,247
We would like to thank you,
however you respond.

446
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,167
Yours sincerely."

447
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,889
So, well...

448
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,885
That's it.

449
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,603
I don't know.

450
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:10,772
She appears to be a well-intentioned,
decent, intelligent girl.

451
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,612
Clearly an idealist,
bold and courageous.

452
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,479
Seems like she deserves
some support.

453
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,192
What do you think?

454
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,871
Nihal?

455
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,874
Frankly...

456
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,125
it didn't sound to me very...

457
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,841
I get this every day from all over.

458
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,886
OK.

459
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,803
What exactly didn't
sound right to you?

460
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,224
Well...

461
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:52,769
Isn't it a bit of a luxury
to build a new place just for this?

462
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:55,691
It's a tiny village after all.

463
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,445
Normally the mukhtar
gives a space for these things.

464
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,150
You decorate it a bit and you manage.

465
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,906
So I felt it sounded a bit too much.

466
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:11,083
Even the municipality
refused to help them.

467
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:15,796
We'll have a hard time finding
common sense in municipal decisions.

468
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,088
Well, I don't know.

469
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,094
And you, Suavi?

470
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,350
I really don't know.

471
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,261
Don't you think you and I,
and a few other local worthies

472
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,231
could get together?

473
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,688
Dear Aydin,
do I really look like a worthy?

474
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,816
My belly is my only worthy feature,
and it's now independent.

475
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,231
However,

476
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,408
I must say
you surprised me, Nihal.

477
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,361
Why?

478
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,583
Well...

479
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:57,121
Because thanks to you this hotel has
been run like a charity for years.

480
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,922
What are you trying to say?

481
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,172
Well...

482
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,636
When a chronic philanthropist,

483
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,140
who has helped
almost every school in the area,

484
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,521
opposes this idea so firmly,
I fail to understand.

485
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,563
What is there to understand?

486
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,934
It's a matter of urgency.

487
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,060
There are primary schools
with leaky roofs and rotten windows.

488
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,156
Little kids studying
with their gloves on.

489
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,659
Isn't it more logical
to solve these problems first?

490
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,579
We've been collecting donations
for this for a long time now.

491
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,539
But it never attracted
your attention.

492
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:39,211
So I don't understand
your sudden charity.

493
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,428
Anyway, I'm expecting guests.
I have to go.

494
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:50,260
Mr Suavi, could you come and see me
for a minute before you leave?

495
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,811
Sure. I'll drop by.

496
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,056
Then I won't say goodbye.
See you shortly.

497
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,991
You know what?

498
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,458
All this poverty and hardship
is like a natural disaster.

499
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,039
In a sense, it's the will of God.

500
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,168
You can't oppose destiny.

501
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:30,422
But God also gave us intelligence
to fight such things.

502
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,341
That's true.

503
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,138
That's true, however...

504
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,474
there are people
specially created for such tasks.

505
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,439
You should leave
these tasks to them.

506
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,400
You're a creative man.
You are an artist.

507
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:49,113
Why bother yourself with such things?

508
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,071
Stick to your own work.

509
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,585
Mr Aydin, Hamdi is here.

510
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,251
- Who's Hamdi?
- Hamdi hodja, the imam.

511
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,300
Fine, I was leaving anyway.

512
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,010
Stay a little bit more.

513
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,463
I have loads of work to do.

514
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,802
Loads of work to do on the farm.

515
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,930
I'll show Suavi out.
Bring Hamdi hodja in here.

516
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:16,934
Alright.

517
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,854
Welcome, Hamdi hodja.

518
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,895
Thank you, Mr Aydin.

519
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,400
You could've kept your shoes on.
It's not that clean.

520
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:09,479
No, Mr Aydin. My shoes got muddy.
It's better like this.

521
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,064
- Some slippers then.
- No, I'm fine.

522
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,944
Hold on.
The floor is very cold in here.

523
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:26,333
Fatma, bring me a pair of slippers.
And some tea and cookies.

524
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,587
OK.

525
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,086
Take a seat, Hamdi hodja.

526
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,976
Yes, Hamdi hodja. I'm listening.

527
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,730
To tell you the truth,
I don't know where to begin.

528
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,567
When you came the other day,
it was a bit...

529
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:50,854
Sorry, just a minute.

530
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,116
It's a bit stuffy in here.
If you don't mind...

531
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,362
I'll open a window.

532
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,491
Yes?

533
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,874
Honestly, I don't know how to put it.

534
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:10,549
It was embarrassing for us,
I'm sorry, but...

535
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,758
we didn't mean badly, of course.

536
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:17,258
The kid made a mistake because
he was upset by what happened.

537
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,759
But he's just a kid, after all.

538
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,430
Of course, he is.

539
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,641
But have you asked him why he did it?

540
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,066
After all, the incident

541
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,688
could have had
quite serious consequences.

542
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,858
Yes, of course, I asked him.

543
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,445
And what did he say?

544
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,780
Well, Mr Aydin...

545
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,413
the kid was upset
by the debt collector,

546
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,289
so he went and did
such a stupid thing.

547
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:49,666
Especially seeing his father
get beaten up.

548
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,465
Beaten up?

549
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:54,884
When the debt collectors came,

550
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:59,005
Ismail tried to stop them obviously.

551
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,259
And the police were there.

552
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,517
So things got out of hand.

553
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,144
I see.

554
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:11,482
So our car paid the price, right?

555
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,857
More or less, Mr Aydin. I apologize.

556
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,490
But now the boy
feels really bad about it.

557
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,113
He wants to come over
and kiss your hand for forgiveness.

558
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,998
No. No need for that.

559
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,872
He regrets it. Really.

560
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,588
But as I said the other day,
we always pay our debts.

561
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,000
I actually have some money now.

562
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,380
So I came to pay for the car window.

563
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,382
How much was it?

564
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,392
It doesn't matter.

565
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:47,563
Sort it out with Hidayet.
I don't know much about it.

566
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,484
I think it was 70 liras or something.

567
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,024
But it's best you talk with Hidayet.

568
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,773
70 liras?

569
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:58,651
70 liras for just one window?

570
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,525
That's right.

571
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,538
And it is not the brand-name one.
If it had been...

572
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,918
Hidayet can show you the bill.

573
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:11,208
Well...

574
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,005
I'm not sure if I have enough on me.

575
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,253
Let me just ask Hidayet
how much it was.

576
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,181
It's no big deal.
There's no rush.

577
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,597
After all, it's just a window.

578
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:29,393
You think so?

579
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,061
In that case,
I'd better not pay in installments.

580
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,905
I'll pay it all in one go, then.

581
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,070
Just to prevent any confusion.

582
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,405
<i>Hello.</i>

583
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,240
You there?

584
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,579
Nothing, I just wanted to ask
how much the window cost.

585
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,075
I remember you saying 70 liras.

586
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,084
Really?

587
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,757
I got it wrong then.
OK, alright.

588
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:00,966
Fine, no problem. Never mind.

589
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:05,679
I was wrong. It's 170, not 70.

590
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,812
170 liras?

591
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,475
But how come?

592
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,851
That's how much it cost.

593
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,979
Hidayet can show you the bill.

594
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,652
I forgot to ask
if he took a bill though.

595
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,610
That's strange.

596
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,446
It's just a window.

597
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,744
Really strange.

598
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:31,534
There must be some mistake, surely.

599
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:40,803
What's this?
Are there no men's slippers?

600
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,342
No, we don't use any at the hotel.

601
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,259
Fatma had these at home.

602
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:50,011
No worries, these will do.
As long as they keep the cold off.

603
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,604
Where shall I put the tea?

604
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,182
Here. Let me move this.

605
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,024
Hamdi hodja, come here.

606
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,493
Thank you.

607
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,303
Now, Hamdi, listen...

608
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:34,352
I've got various houses and shops
in town.

609
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,148
Not just mine actually...

610
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:39,353
They're my sister Necla's too.

611
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:42,731
If I tried
to look after them all myself,

612
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:47,118
I'd have no time to work
on my book and articles.

613
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,989
See what I mean?

614
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:54,709
So I let Hidayet and the lawyers
deal with the rent and lawsuits.

615
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,875
I often don't even know
what they're doing.

616
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,545
And if they tell me,
I tend to forget.

617
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,468
The other day,
your younger or older brother...

618
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,961
Older.

619
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,588
He said some inappropriate things.

620
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:12,306
But I insist...

621
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:13,930
not to mention the debt collectors.

622
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,437
I wasn't even aware
you were my tenants.

623
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:23,896
When the rent is not paid, lawyers
do these things automatically.

624
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,689
Understand?

625
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:28,987
Of course, Mr Aydin. It's obvious.

626
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,326
You have to do these things.

627
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,498
You've been very patient with us.

628
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:38,249
But, since Ismail came out of prison,

629
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,746
he hasn't sorted himself out yet.

630
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,750
Nobody gives him a job.

631
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,010
I don't see why not, but they don't.

632
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,420
That's why we need time
to get back on our feet.

633
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:54,724
So, Mr Aydin,
if you could just step in

634
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,891
to stop the eviction...

635
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,434
We will sort something out
as soon as possible.

636
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:03,604
We really don't want
to lose the house.

637
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,065
I spent my entire childhood
in that house.

638
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,656
So if you could give us more time...

639
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:12,193
What do you expect me to say?

640
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,364
I see your point but...

641
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,083
you need to discuss it with Hidayet.

642
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,826
I don't know anything about it.

643
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:23,876
Did you talk to him?

644
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,084
- No.
- Talk to Hidayet.

645
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,797
I mean...

646
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,754
There's Hidayet and the lawyers.
You don't need to come to me.

647
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,263
They know more about it.

648
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,391
Don't come to me again.

649
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:42,185
I don't want to mislead you.

650
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:50,318
In a country
with a 99% Muslim population,

651
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:53,405
don't the people deserve men of God

652
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,657
who are cultivated, neat,

653
00:47:55,873 --> 00:48:00,001
whose very presence is reassuring?

654
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:04,671
The weekly sermon
prepared by our imams,

655
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,624
from their reading,

656
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,804
will be heard
with pleasure and admiration

657
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,882
and will elevate the people.

658
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:18,602
Islam is a religion
of civilization and high culture.

659
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,685
How's that?

660
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,026
Fine.

661
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,530
It's not too harsh?

662
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,692
No.

663
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,705
Nothing that might be misunderstood?

664
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,618
No.

665
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,409
You don't say anything
about religion itself.

666
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,784
You talk about the practices
of those who apply it.

667
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:48,546
And I also say
Islam is a religion of high culture.

668
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,093
Of course.

669
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,002
I don't really care for these things.

670
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,885
But you know it's delicate.

671
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:04,054
But the guy annoys me so much,
I can't stop myself writing.

672
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,019
So he managed to become
the subject of an article.

673
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:12,822
With his shabbiness,
slyness, vagueness...

674
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,565
You know...

675
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:21,571
I once played an imam in a play
and got good reviews.

676
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:25,700
Now when I see him,
I tend to think I wasn't that good.

677
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,916
I missed so many details.

678
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,045
Did you see that play?

679
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,721
Sorry? Which play?

680
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,928
The one where I played an imam.

681
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,723
"Wounded Birds".

682
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,174
Can't remember.

683
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:44,226
He comes running out in the
first scene, bursting for the toilet.

684
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,146
It must have been when I was abroad.

685
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,357
He comes running on:
"Where's the loo?"

686
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,402
- No. Was it a comedy?
- Yes.

687
00:49:57,954 --> 00:50:00,788
- And first...
- I don't remember.

688
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,247
I want to ask you something.

689
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,754
Not resisting evil...

690
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,707
What does that mean to you?

691
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,593
What?

692
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:22,435
Not resisting evil, I said.
What do you think that means?

693
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,438
Not resisting evil?

694
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,524
How do you understand it?

695
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,355
Well...

696
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,276
One day, thieves attack you
and you don't resist.

697
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,072
I suppose that's it.

698
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,906
I don't want an example.
Give me a logical definition.

699
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,656
I wonder if there is any logic in it.

700
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,536
A logical definition
of not resisting evil.

701
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,078
Not resisting evil is...

702
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,168
to remain indifferent
to incidents defined as evil

703
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,343
within an ethical framework.

704
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:56,673
How's that?

705
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,096
For instance, if we were to...

706
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,144
make this idea of not resisting evil

707
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,595
the basis of our behavior,

708
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,096
what kind of life would we have?

709
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,148
What kind of life?

710
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,854
What would it be like?

711
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,270
Thieves, murderers, psychos
would prosper.

712
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,199
Chaos would reign everywhere.

713
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:21,693
- What would be left, then?
- Left?

714
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:26,790
Cripples and madhouses.
How should I know?

715
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,959
Maybe you're right.

716
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,296
But I couldn't take the easy way out
like you.

717
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:35,675
What easy way out?

718
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:39,259
Maybe you should think about it.

719
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,755
You went a bit too fast.

720
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,305
I didn't. It's simple.

721
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:47,643
Someone does wrong,
you don't resist. That's it.

722
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,058
What else is there?

723
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:51,306
I still feel...

724
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:54,900
we're fooling ourselves
when we're fighting evil.

725
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:58,937
As if we didn't want to look
at every aspect, we hide some.

726
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,445
Like what?

727
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,942
Fatma, this honey is frozen.
You got another?

728
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,455
- I'll check.
- If not, just put it in warm water.

729
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:11,753
Instead of struggling against evil,
why not do the exact opposite?

730
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,000
Say you don't want
a painting to be stolen.

731
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:18,092
It's maybe better
to hand it to the thief.

732
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,253
Maybe it's a better solution.

733
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,587
Say I want to marry an heiress

734
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,764
because her father is rich.

735
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:30,481
To foil my sneaky plot, she should
throw herself in my arms. Is that it?

736
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,940
But maybe he would be ashamed,
feel remorse

737
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:35,895
and admit his fault.

738
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,730
Shouldn't we allow for that?

739
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,648
What a ridiculous idea!

740
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:44,285
Should we allow mass murders
because some killers could regret it?

741
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,950
Even soaps don't
produce such nonsense.

742
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,159
Well, I don't care what you think.
I have my solution.

743
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:56,586
I see no reason to resist
an evil act aimed at me personally.

744
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,217
Does someone want to kill me?
Be my guest.

745
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,589
Because, if I were to defend myself,

746
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,969
that wouldn't make
the murderer a better person.

747
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,978
But if you defend yourself,
you may not die.

748
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,393
Isn't that worth it?

749
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,441
Trust me, it isn't.

750
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,029
Let's drop it.
I feel depressed already.

751
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,569
What do you think, Nihal?

752
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,492
To be honest...
I don't quite grasp it.

753
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,198
Where does this need come from?

754
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,328
Why do you feel like this?

755
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,618
It's not a need, just an idea.

756
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,035
She wants to help evil get done.

757
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,663
Hold on... Is that how you want
to end evil in the world?

758
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,546
Or do you want
to find peace that way?

759
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:45,419
She wants to help the baddies
do bad more comfortably.

760
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:49,132
I'm just saying we should
give evildoers a chance

761
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,053
to feel regret.

762
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,387
A chance for the bad guys, great!

763
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,689
You pretend not to understand.

764
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,649
That's how I understood it, sweetie.

765
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,443
How did you manage that, sweetie?

766
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,153
She's saying evildoers regret it
if you help them do it?

767
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,446
- No...
- That's what I understand.

768
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,694
How can you understand that?

769
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,578
So how do you understand it?

770
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,116
It is very clear what she's saying.

771
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:18,672
If someone does me harm,
a thief or someone...

772
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,543
I don't resist and by doing so,

773
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,341
stir his conscience...

774
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,927
Stop it. What's got into you two
this morning?

775
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,968
What's this about helping
evildoers do evil?

776
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,517
Who said that?

777
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,390
Is that how you plan to end evil?

778
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,520
You're trying to provoke us now.

779
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,478
I'm just saying what I understood.
Am I wrong?

780
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:42,023
It's easy to understand.

781
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,901
She says if something bad
is done to us,

782
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:50,578
by not resisting, the evildoer
may be sorry and give up.

783
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,121
Is that possible?

784
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,949
That's not the question.

785
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,951
I'm just saying one could try.

786
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,796
So the Jews should deport themselves.

787
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,919
So that Hitler doesn't get tired.

788
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:04,758
He'd say "Here they are,
no point gassing them"?

789
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,631
- You joking?
- No. That's what I understand.

790
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,508
Help evildoers do evil
so they stop doing evil.

791
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,601
Never heard such nonsense before!

792
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,807
I misunderstand

793
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,600
or you aren't making yourself
clear enough.

794
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:20,229
Mr Aydin,

795
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,390
they're here again.

796
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,945
- Who?
- Hamdi.

797
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:27,149
- What Hamdi? Hamdi hodja?
- Yes.

798
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,862
- He's here?
- Yes, he's upstairs.

799
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,744
What for?
He already came the other day.

800
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,078
I don't know, he won't say.

801
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,956
He's acting all mysterious.

802
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,535
Not him, not now.

803
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,536
Did you tell him I'm here?

804
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,663
Of course not. I said I'd see.

805
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,875
If he wants to leave something,
you take it.

806
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,086
He came yesterday too.
He didn't leave anything.

807
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,508
- Yesterday, too?
- Yes.

808
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:52,678
Why didn't you tell me?

809
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,719
We talked about it. You were in bed.

810
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,052
You had me say you weren't in.

811
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,186
Really?

812
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,682
- That boy is here too.
- What boy?

813
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,562
The window one.

814
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,861
- He was here yesterday, too.
- I begin to smell trouble.

815
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,993
Why not speak to him?
They've come all that way.

816
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,744
What's so frightening?

817
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,323
Nothing. It's not that, my dear.

818
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,866
But he's whiney, annoying,
never finishes a sentence.

819
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:22,328
But they're here now.
We can't send them away.

820
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,416
Alright. Let them in.

821
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,667
Let's see what he's after.

822
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,340
I'll do it your way
to see if I got you right.

823
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,629
Hamdi's coming.

824
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,847
I'll say yes to everything he wants.

825
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:39,309
- But he has done no evil to you.
- Maybe he will.

826
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,350
We don't know why he's here yet.
But I won't protest.

827
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,601
Evil or good, let's see...

828
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,485
- A knife in his pocket?
- Who knows?

829
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,406
Come in, Hamdi hodja, welcome.

830
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,401
Welcome, Mr Hamdi.

831
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,574
Thank you.

832
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,541
Sorry for disturbing you
during breakfast.

833
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,039
You're not disturbing us at all.

834
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,119
Would you like some breakfast?

835
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:07,499
Thank you, madam. We're not hungry.

836
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:11,174
Please have a seat.
Fatma, some tea for our guests.

837
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,429
And cookies for the boy.

838
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,221
The valley is muddy.

839
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,549
I'm sorry, we're covered in mud.

840
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,769
Why were you in the valley?

841
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:22,600
- Which way did you take?
- We took the shortcut.

842
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,939
I saw two figures over there.
Was that you?

843
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,438
- Probably.
- Really.

844
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:31,103
You walked all the way from town?

845
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,024
Yes, we did. Why?

846
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,655
It's quite a long way.

847
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,612
Yes, it's far.

848
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,500
It is. Isn't it?

849
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,624
Did you walk the last time too?

850
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,791
I mean yesterday.

851
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,212
Yes.

852
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,338
My goodness.

853
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,505
Why didn't you say so?

854
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,136
Hidayet could have given you
a lift back.

855
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,636
I feel sorry now.

856
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,686
No need to apologize.

857
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:07,474
It's like exercise for us.
Don't worry.

858
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,271
Aydin, show them a seat...

859
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,527
Fatma, bring my tea over there.

860
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,864
Please have a seat.

861
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,322
You don't even have a moped?

862
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:23,282
I'll get one when things
start looking up.

863
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,700
- That would be great.
- God willing.

864
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:29,247
Luckily the house
is next to the mosque.

865
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,380
Five round trips a day
would have been hard.

866
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,046
God bless you.

867
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:36,585
Is he your son?

868
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:38,637
- He looks like you.
- No.

869
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,380
He's my nephew.
My brother's son.

870
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,060
I don't have any children.

871
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,848
Struggling to make ends meet,
I couldn't get married.

872
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,899
My fate, I guess.

873
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,476
You will eventually.
You're still young.

874
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,228
But Ilyas is like a son to me.

875
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,159
Of course.
Which class are you in, Ilyas?

876
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,738
Speak up, son, which grade?

877
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,779
Fifth.

878
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:06,747
Mr Aydin...

879
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,621
I'm off to the industrial zone.

880
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,798
- What for?
- To get the car door fixed.

881
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,875
What's so urgent about it?

882
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,340
Nothing.
But the engine too is making a noise.

883
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:21,213
- What noise?
- A kind of "zheeee".

884
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:25,436
Could be the cylinders.
I don't want to ruin the engine.

885
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,231
Alright, go.

886
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,329
Mr Aydin, as I said before...

887
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,075
after that incident,
the boy felt terribly sorry.

888
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,826
- Which incident?
- That stone he threw.

889
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,749
That's over and done with.

890
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,925
I mean... the poor boy feels so bad,

891
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,677
he's been all upset
and worried ever since.

892
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:05,053
Now, Mr Aydin,
apologizing is not easy.

893
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,477
As for repentance,
it's a matter of maturity.

894
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,316
But while there's still resentment,

895
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:14,056
one can't feel truly at peace.

896
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,643
Our Prophet said,

897
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:19,313
"Repentance is penitence."

898
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:24,319
If a person convinces you
that they're really sorry,

899
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:29,075
then we have no choice
except to forgive them.

900
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,744
That's how it is.

901
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:34,833
And our Ilyas is such a smart
and golden-hearted boy

902
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:37,961
that young as he is, he listened to me.

903
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,507
He thought about it and agreed.

904
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,348
That's why he wanted to come today

905
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,472
to kiss your hand.

906
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,968
I said, "That would be
the right thing, my boy."

907
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:53,685
"You'll see, show regret and
Mr Aydin will surely forgive you."

908
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:54,855
Right?

909
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:58,645
It's really not necessary.
It doesn't matter at all.

910
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:01,693
Of course it's necessary.

911
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:06,279
Otherwise he'll get away
with what he's done.

912
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,955
That's the biggest danger.

913
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,580
Ilyas? Isn't that right, my dear?

914
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,374
I don't like getting my hand kissed.

915
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,374
My father never allowed it either.

916
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,757
We'd struggle to kiss his hand.
Wouldn't we, Necla?

917
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,383
No. He can't find real peace then.

918
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,179
Isn't that so, dear?

919
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:28,433
Come on now, son,
kiss Mr Aydin's hand.

920
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:38,315
Ilyas?

921
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:42,906
Didn't we say we'd go and do this
without telling your dad?

922
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,826
Don't embarrass me
in front of everyone.

923
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:49,743
Come on, son. Kiss Mr Aydin's hand.

924
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,659
Fine, then.

925
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,294
Ilyas, come on.
Mr Aydin is waiting.

926
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,077
Don't pull, keep it loose.

927
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,964
Pull now.

928
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,390
Let it rest a bit.

929
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,369
Don't get too close.

930
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,086
Wasabi.

931
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:09,546
Oh my God. Brings tears
to your eyes, doesn't it?

932
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:13,386
In Japan also, hot is beautiful.

933
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,266
You don't eat that in Japan.

934
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:19,729
When I was a child, I didn't like it.

935
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,605
But just now, I love wasabi.

936
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,574
Oh, it's freezing.

937
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,324
I'm chilled to the bone.

938
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,964
What are you doing?

939
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,003
Not much.

940
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,430
Where's Aydin?

941
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,637
No idea.

942
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,936
Must have gone into town.
He's not in his room?

943
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,308
No, he isn't.

944
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:51,042
I'll make more coffee.
Want some?

945
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,253
Coffee, I said, want some?

946
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,006
Yes, I'll have one.

947
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:03,641
I don't know what to do
with the new maid, Nihal.

948
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:06,433
She put glasses I love
in the dishwasher.

949
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:07,982
Two got smashed.

950
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,477
I know, she told me.

951
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:14,652
They're obviously too thin
for the dishwasher. They broke.

952
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:18,198
I'm thinking of taking it out
of her wages to teach her.

953
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,609
That's a bit much. Forget it.

954
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:25,116
I'm not exaggerating.
There are things you love and value.

955
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,952
I bought them in Istanbul.
You can't get them anymore.

956
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:32,794
I know, but they're just glasses.

957
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:37,875
Maybe you're right. I don't know.

958
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:46,850
No, maybe you're right.

959
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,563
I'm aware I'm a bit nervy lately.

960
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:57,316
It's because I worry too much.

961
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,068
Worry about what?

962
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:03,037
There's so much going around
in my head.

963
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:08,041
My ex has become a real alcoholic.

964
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,701
- Who? Necdet?
- Yes.

965
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,797
But he always drank a lot, didn't he?

966
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,090
He did indeed, but...

967
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:20,426
he's been drinking much more
since we separated.

968
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:23,511
He starts the minute he gets up.

969
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,885
But there's nothing
you can do about that.

970
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,773
I know...

971
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,684
but sometimes...

972
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:37,399
I can't help thinking
we're worse off after splitting up.

973
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:41,773
Him over there in that state,
me here miserable.

974
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:44,822
- Is that what you really think?
- Well...

975
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:51,289
Maybe I'm just trying to figure out
where I went wrong.

976
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,627
What I did that made us
end up like this.

977
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:55,836
But if you've still found nothing

978
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:58,831
years later,
maybe it's not your fault at all.

979
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,006
Don't you agree?

980
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:03,173
You want me to join the herd

981
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:07,048
that believes
all badness comes from others?

982
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:07,973
No.

983
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:11,312
But it still doesn't have to be
"your" mistake.

984
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:12,975
That's what I'm saying.

985
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:15,978
Why do you never want
to think like that?

986
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,231
Because I don't see any good in it.

987
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:24,447
A sensible person should only be
interested in her own share of guilt.

988
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:28,699
I see no harm in some self-deception
to protect yourself.

989
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,913
But, well...

990
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,375
Where do you think you're wrong?

991
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,585
I don't know but...

992
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,463
I'm just saying it as an example...

993
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:45,798
If I'd overlooked all the evil stuff
Necdet did to me,

994
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,058
if I hadn't resisted,

995
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,637
if I hadn't divorced him, say.

996
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:01,441
If I could have made him
face his own evil side.

997
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,234
I don't know.

998
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:08,160
I wonder what would've happened
if I had acted differently.

999
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:12,908
You mean, if you hadn't resisted
all the bad things he did,

1000
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:15,753
he would've finally felt ashamed?

1001
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:17,083
Yes.

1002
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:20,666
Yes. Exactly. You put it well.

1003
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:25,844
I know it sounds absurd,
but it isn't, believe me.

1004
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:30,135
Sorry, Necla, but I find it
hard to believe.

1005
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:33,851
People don't change that much
after a certain age.

1006
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:38,233
On the contrary,
all their bad habits get even worse.

1007
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,613
So remaining silent
in the face of evil

1008
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:46,696
does nothing but make the other
feel even more justified.

1009
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:49,324
I think he regrets it now, too.

1010
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,538
That's why I say this.

1011
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,415
I feel it.

1012
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:59,708
If he could find an excuse,
he'd come here right away.

1013
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:04,341
If I were living somewhere else,
he'd definitely do that.

1014
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,593
But after all that happened,

1015
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,257
he is a bit scared of Aydin now.

1016
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,393
But you know
what I sometimes feel like?

1017
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,939
Going and asking him
for forgiveness.

1018
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:26,819
Necdet?

1019
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,023
Yes.

1020
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,537
But you did nothing wrong.

1021
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,165
Precisely.

1022
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:38,199
In fact, that's the beauty of it.

1023
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:41,167
Making the other really ashamed.

1024
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:45,126
And in this way,
maybe bringing out the good in him.

1025
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,965
Necla, have you been watching
too many soap operas recently?

1026
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:57,884
What do you mean?

1027
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,355
Such things only happen there.

1028
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,937
There's nothing to say.

1029
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,822
It's your decision.

1030
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:09,321
I think it's utter nonsense,

1031
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:14,035
but if that's what you want to do
nobody is going to stop you.

1032
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,039
You can do what you like.

1033
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,620
But then, you're the one
who has to face the consequences.

1034
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:22,753
Keep that in mind, too.

1035
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:25,002
That's how I see it.

1036
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:43,349
Those petty,
multiple-meaning, sarcastic words,

1037
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,945
and those little,
cynical lip movements.

1038
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,234
I realize now how sick I am of it,
how much I hate it.

1039
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,945
Necla, you're going too far. Please.

1040
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,161
The real reason
I'd apologize to Necdet

1041
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,749
is maybe to get away
from all of you and all of this.

1042
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,876
It's pretty clear now.

1043
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,334
Nobody is going to stop me?
Of course not.

1044
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,334
I don't need
anybody's permission for that.

1045
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,254
This is my father's house too.

1046
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:16,639
I'll stay or go as I please.

1047
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,224
Besides...

1048
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:25,433
I've already paid the price
for telling the truth to your face.

1049
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:29,020
A price none of you has paid.

1050
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:42,990
Isn't that

1051
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,083
Omar Sharif?

1052
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,451
What?

1053
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:48,791
The photo. It's Omar Sharif?

1054
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,801
Yes. They shot a movie here.

1055
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,084
At this hotel?

1056
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:55,089
No, I mean in this area.

1057
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,429
He's such a humble man.

1058
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,722
He'd take a picture with anybody.

1059
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,181
- Really?
- Yes.

1060
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,845
You don't expect that of a big star.

1061
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:05,269
But he's not like that.

1062
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,350
What film was it?

1063
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,821
I can't remember.
I don't want to mislead you.

1064
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:12,603
Hello.

1065
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:18,025
What was the movie
Omar Sharif shot here?

1066
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,861
- "Monsieur Ibrahim".
- That's it.

1067
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,622
I've heard about it.
Where exactly did they shoot it?

1068
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,749
Around here.
In Ishtar and other places.

1069
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,339
- Ishtar?
- Yes.

1070
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,882
Interesting.

1071
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,001
Let's see where it is.

1072
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,841
Where is everybody?

1073
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:43,305
You mean Mrs Nihal and Necla?
They were here a minute ago.

1074
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:45,470
Doing what?

1075
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:47,017
Talking.

1076
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,649
Here, in the lobby.

1077
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:50,524
Really?

1078
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,571
I went out and when I came back,
they'd left.

1079
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:56,025
Were they talking normally?

1080
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,985
What do you mean "normally"?

1081
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,575
Whatever.

1082
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,832
- Would you like some tea?
- Please.

1083
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,793
Could you make us some tea?

1084
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,547
Ishtar is very near.
Right opposite Akky.

1085
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:18,970
No, I found it.
It's 20 kilometers away.

1086
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:22,095
Well done, you know better than us.

1087
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:24,806
No, I don't.

1088
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,065
What do you do?

1089
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:30,853
I mean what's your job?
Are you a guide?

1090
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,352
No, I'm not.

1091
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,519
I explore.

1092
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,656
Isn't a motorbike hard in winter?

1093
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,322
The harder it is
the better we like it.

1094
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:43,371
Who's "we"?

1095
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:45,280
Motocross bikers.

1096
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,916
I see.

1097
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,632
I did something like that
in my student days.

1098
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:54,796
Really?

1099
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,458
Hitchhiked across Europe
with friends.

1100
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:01,848
When the going got tough
we hopped on a train.

1101
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,925
Those were the days.

1102
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,514
Sleeping wherever we ended up.

1103
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,269
The world was our oyster.

1104
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,396
It felt like life would never end.

1105
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,984
Full of the energy of youth.

1106
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,200
I don't care much for hitchhiking.

1107
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,202
I need to be more self-sufficient.

1108
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:29,577
I should always have the gear
to get by.

1109
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,578
That's why a bike suits me better.

1110
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,210
So you check into a hotel
for the night?

1111
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:40,428
I have a tent and stuff
but I didn't want to pitch it here.

1112
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:43,882
This place is a bit like a cave

1113
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,885
and natural like a tent.

1114
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,260
And I also had some stuff to write.

1115
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,980
Really? What are you writing?

1116
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,607
My experiences.

1117
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:55,527
Like a travel journal?

1118
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:58,648
There are travel notes as well.

1119
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,699
Let's call them essays.

1120
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,569
Soon to be published as a book.

1121
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,660
Really? That's good.

1122
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,706
I'm writing a book, too.

1123
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,584
Really?

1124
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:14,711
It will be a serious, thick book.

1125
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,923
History of Turkish Theatre.

1126
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,961
There is no serious study
on the topic.

1127
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:25,130
Unfortunately.

1128
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,267
So I'm doing research.
There's loads to read.

1129
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:31,051
Old documents, articles,
books and so on.

1130
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:34,599
I've nearly finished, all I have
to do now is start writing.

1131
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:39,686
- "Getting started is half the job".
- That's true.

1132
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:45,032
- You used to be an actor, I believe.
- That's right.

1133
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,827
That explains your topic.

1134
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,159
Yes, that's right.

1135
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,738
I prefer the term 'thespiar though.

1136
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:54,250
Acting has fallen from grace
a little lately.

1137
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:57,251
I was on stage for 25 years.

1138
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,541
And I am proud to say
I never did any soap operas.

1139
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,924
Despite some very attractive offers.

1140
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:10,721
I remember something
Omar Sharif told me.

1141
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:13,895
When we met,
he learned I was an actor.

1142
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:16,436
He gave me this look and said,

1143
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:20,609
"Acting is all about honesty."

1144
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,697
It really is.

1145
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:26,655
Awesome.

1146
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,078
- By the way, we got a horse.
- Really?

1147
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,661
Can I ride it now?

1148
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:36,627
Not yet. It has to settle in
a few days.

1149
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:39,252
How long will you be staying?

1150
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,751
- Here?
- Yes.

1151
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:42,373
Don't know.

1152
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,129
I haven't decided yet.

1153
01:18:44,846 --> 01:18:46,470
I live from day to day.

1154
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,308
I don't plan ahead much.

1155
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:53,019
Otherwise it's not
a real journey anymore.

1156
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,856
You lose the sense of adventure.

1157
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,851
How can I put it?

1158
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:04,069
The way a well-planned life
doesn't feel like a real life.

1159
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:05,692
As the saying goes,

1160
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:09,365
life passes by
while we're busy making plans.

1161
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,954
True. Very true.

1162
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,994
Weren't you going to the market
with Fatma?

1163
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:04,041
I told Fatma to go.
I didn't feel like it.

1164
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:12,217
Have you finished
the book I lent you?

1165
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,809
A while ago.

1166
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:17,801
So?

1167
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,518
What did you think?

1168
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,858
Worth translating?

1169
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,321
No, I don't think
it's worth the bother.

1170
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,419
If I'm not interrupting,
can I ask you something?

1171
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:48,093
Of course. But please,
nothing about not resisting evil, OK?

1172
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:51,963
I found a good source.

1173
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:55,056
I should finish this
and send it quick.

1174
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:00,054
Judging from your excitement,
you struck gold.

1175
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,773
Not really.

1176
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:06,183
It's a sequel to my previous article.
It aroused lots of interest.

1177
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:08,648
- Really?
- Yes.

1178
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,109
So Vehbi said.

1179
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,905
He said the paper got
abusive phone calls.

1180
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,996
You know Vehbi.

1181
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,749
He loves to exaggerate reactions

1182
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:26,921
to make his paper look influential.

1183
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,999
The article wasn't provocative.

1184
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,797
I agree, but...

1185
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,680
I'm not so sure.

1186
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:41,555
Why do you get involved
in such things in the first place?

1187
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:45,524
You're an actor.
Write what you know about.

1188
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:49,610
But dear Necla, often
you don't choose what you write.

1189
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,572
In a sense,
the subject chooses you.

1190
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,698
Of course everyone has the right to
talk or write about what they like.

1191
01:21:57,163 --> 01:22:01,374
But you have to accept that
the product will match its maker.

1192
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,573
Meaning?

1193
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:06,584
I mean there will be a big difference
between the views

1194
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,499
of a lifelong expert

1195
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,168
and an amateur's.

1196
01:22:10,343 --> 01:22:14,043
But can't an outsider
sometimes see things more clearly?

1197
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,131
Frankly, not in this case.

1198
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:18,677
Which case?

1199
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:21,424
Let me put it like this.
The other day...

1200
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:24,141
I carefully read that article
you gave me.

1201
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:27,268
Then I couldn't stop
and read some others.

1202
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:28,647
And?

1203
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:32,945
I probably hadn't paid
enough attention before...

1204
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,317
but they felt quite different
this time.

1205
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,612
Different in what sense?

1206
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:39,617
I don't know.

1207
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:42,869
Has Nihal read them?

1208
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,210
No, I don't think so.

1209
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,750
She doesn't care much
for my articles.

1210
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:50,586
Shouldn't a wife read
what her husband writes?

1211
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:53,585
I don't know. Should she?

1212
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,545
Maybe she reads them in secret.

1213
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,884
I believe she does.

1214
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:03,427
She's an expert at criticizing
by remaining silent.

1215
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:07,096
I don't believe she'd be
objective enough anyway.

1216
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,436
Whatever.

1217
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,649
- So?
- Well, honestly,

1218
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,567
I probably couldn't be so daring.

1219
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,068
About what?

1220
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,439
I mean...

1221
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:23,496
Pontificating in a column
on matters I don't know much about.

1222
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,410
Pontificating?

1223
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:29,749
I see you found my articles
worse than I thought.

1224
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:33,337
No. I'm not saying they're bad...

1225
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,133
It's something else.

1226
01:23:36,304 --> 01:23:37,549
Something else?

1227
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,714
Like what?

1228
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,425
I mean, they're like...

1229
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,433
Mediocre? Bloodless?

1230
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,432
I can't find the right term.

1231
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,018
Harmless.

1232
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,900
Is that what you mean?

1233
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,188
I don't know. Maybe.

1234
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,984
Your words are sweeter
than honey today.

1235
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:03,903
I'm trying to be realistic.

1236
01:24:04,332 --> 01:24:06,323
Well, bravo, what else can I say?

1237
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:09,575
If you want,
I can stop being realistic.

1238
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:16,042
Too late.
The genie is out of the bottle.

1239
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,545
Well, if you ask for opinions

1240
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:22,213
you have to face the consequences.

1241
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,882
What can I say? That's true.

1242
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,815
In the old days, we admired you.

1243
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:39,948
We thought

1244
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:43,367
you'd do great things,
become quite famous even.

1245
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,241
But it didn't happen.

1246
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,374
The elephant gave birth to a mouse.

1247
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:57,004
Sorry to disappoint you.

1248
01:24:57,176 --> 01:24:59,583
That's obviously not your fault.

1249
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,464
It's us who set the bar so high.

1250
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,595
So I should feel comforted.

1251
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:10,719
What about
"Flowers of the Steppes"?

1252
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:12,387
What did you think of it?

1253
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:14,357
To be honest,

1254
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:18,311
that's the article that actually
made me think like this.

1255
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,860
Really? In what way?

1256
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:26,826
How can I put it?
This soppy romanticism.

1257
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:31,160
This nave, unconvincing self-belief.

1258
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:33,330
Takes no risks, for one thing.

1259
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:36,498
It looks like the writer

1260
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,549
adopts positive values
accepted by all,

1261
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,677
just to endear himself.

1262
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:45,756
Sometimes the disguise of lyricism

1263
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:49,349
makes it stink of sentimentality.

1264
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,769
You really are annoyed.

1265
01:25:53,941 --> 01:25:56,230
I must confess
I don't like this style much.

1266
01:25:56,735 --> 01:26:00,234
If what you say is true,
I should just quit writing.

1267
01:26:01,282 --> 01:26:04,152
No, dear.
This is just my point of view.

1268
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:07,909
Luckily not everybody
thinks like you.

1269
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,449
Naturally.

1270
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,455
Who are they?

1271
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,880
I see you're curious.

1272
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:21,873
No. It's just because
you mentioned it.

1273
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:26,673
- I haven't offended you, have I?
- Not at all.

1274
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:28,927
Are you sure?

1275
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:34,397
Maybe a little.

1276
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:39,183
A writer can be very sensitive
regarding his work.

1277
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:41,895
But don't worry, I can handle it.

1278
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:46,366
But dear, you're not coming up with
coherent, constructive criticism.

1279
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,987
Like your remarks
are always hiding something.

1280
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:51,788
That's what's annoying.

1281
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:57,296
So I get to thinking
it's me you hate, not the articles.

1282
01:26:57,463 --> 01:26:58,411
That's absurd.

1283
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:00,213
But that's the case.

1284
01:27:00,508 --> 01:27:02,796
And of course,
we've become very different now.

1285
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,635
We must accept that.

1286
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:07,674
We see things,
life itself, quite differently.

1287
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:11,343
That's probably natural.

1288
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:15,219
The older you get,
the more particular, rigid you get.

1289
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:19,731
After a while, it seems normal
you don't like them.

1290
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,693
That's maybe how it should be.

1291
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:26,991
In fact, this might even be something
I should be pleased about.

1292
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:27,989
You see?

1293
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,654
Anyway...

1294
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:32,663
I don't want to go into it
any further.

1295
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:40,879
It's incredible how you always
float to the surface like olive oil.

1296
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,460
You find a way
to justify yourself, as usual.

1297
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:47,007
Necla, please, can we drop it?

1298
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:50,299
You wanted to ask me something
when you came in.

1299
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:51,761
It's done.

1300
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,305
No. What were you going to ask?

1301
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:59,062
The subject of the article
you've just sent.

1302
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,976
No, it wasn't that.

1303
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:03,110
Yes, that's what it was.

1304
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:07,987
OK. Religion, morals, this and that.
Nothing of your interest.

1305
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:09,818
Now I see.

1306
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:14,195
You found a victim
and you're making the most of it.

1307
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:16,080
Stop harassing the poor man.

1308
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:17,874
Necla, I'm losing my temper.

1309
01:28:18,085 --> 01:28:19,460
What does it have to do with it?

1310
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:23,329
I should ask what religion, faith,
spirituality have to do with you.

1311
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:26,498
Have you ever set foot in a mosque?

1312
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:29,048
Have you ever prayed
so that you can talk about it?

1313
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:32,257
Do I have to go to a mosque
to write about religion?

1314
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:33,511
How absurd is that?

1315
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:37,218
You keep saying the imam's
feet stink. What's it to you?

1316
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:41,016
The man walked 10 km in this cold.

1317
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:44,192
And he had to enter the room
with those feet.

1318
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,859
What exactly are you trying to say?

1319
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:49,569
You know damn well what I'm saying.

1320
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,486
No, I don't.

1321
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,905
Then let me explain.

1322
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:56,412
I find it insincere
to talk about spirituality

1323
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:59,417
when you haven't shed
a single tear on your parents' grave

1324
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,660
and never even visited them.

1325
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:04,873
There are ways of crying
you don't know, Mrs Necla.

1326
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,338
Fine, alright. Go on then.

1327
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:15,053
I wish my threshold of self-deception
was as low as yours.

1328
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:19,893
Then I could easily find
things worth doing

1329
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:22,732
and escape this boredom perhaps.

1330
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:26,312
I don't understand

1331
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:29,772
how you don't get fed up
harping on like that.

1332
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:34,782
Applying yourself, being persistent

1333
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:39,865
is a precondition to penetrating
deeper and creating new things.

1334
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:42,955
Second, what boredom
are you talking about?

1335
01:29:44,338 --> 01:29:47,956
I've never had a spare second
to feel bored.

1336
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:53,381
And in the present circumstances,
I believe boredom is quite a luxury.

1337
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:56,592
So it wasn't a luxury in the past
and now it is?

1338
01:29:56,767 --> 01:30:01,643
Fine, I'll put it like this.
Boredom is always a luxury. Happy?

1339
01:30:03,524 --> 01:30:07,437
We are so different,
we have such opposite souls.

1340
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:10,149
It's hard to believe we're related.

1341
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:13,738
That's normal.
Siblings are never alike.

1342
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:17,075
If one is hardworking,
the other is lazy. One is clever,

1343
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:19,997
the other is a fool. One is sociable,
the other introverted.

1344
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:21,540
That's just how it is.

1345
01:30:21,709 --> 01:30:23,950
- So?
- So it's normal.

1346
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:26,659
I can't believe

1347
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,622
how I left a place like Istanbul

1348
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:35,508
and agreed to come and live with you.

1349
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:39,968
My soul's withering here.

1350
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,805
I feel at home
wherever my room and my books are.

1351
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:45,854
I feel no need for another place.

1352
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:50,686
You must be able to create a world
for yourself, find an occupation.

1353
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:55,320
You're bored
because you sit around doing nothing.

1354
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:56,820
You've really let yourself go.

1355
01:30:56,994 --> 01:30:58,951
You used to do translations.

1356
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,663
You stopped even that.

1357
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:02,206
Of course you're bored.

1358
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,165
We must work, have a passion.

1359
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:09,123
You know what they say, an idle life
is far from honor and honesty.

1360
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:14,504
It depends on how
you define "working".

1361
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:18,461
It doesn't mean
running around pointlessly.

1362
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,716
So what does it mean?

1363
01:31:21,477 --> 01:31:24,928
People who think a lot are actually
more active than the others.

1364
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:26,434
Even if they don't do anything.

1365
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:29,975
So you mean you're busy thinking.

1366
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,145
Maybe I don't know what to do.

1367
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:37,323
I've no passion
to give me direction.

1368
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,902
But then, what do you do?

1369
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:45,120
You waste your best years with things
that are irrelevant to you.

1370
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:49,329
Are you not tired of tinkering
uselessly, like an alchemist?

1371
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,463
Seeing you like this
depresses me.

1372
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:59,426
Necla, what are you raving about,
for God's sake?

1373
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:01,930
You having a bad night or what?

1374
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:04,680
The more I try to humor you,
the harsher you get.

1375
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:07,141
- Calm down.
- Come on, please.

1376
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:10,606
I'm not surprised you got divorced
after all these years.

1377
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:14,476
No man would put up with
this sharp tongue of yours.

1378
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:19,071
It takes one to know one, so true.

1379
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:20,238
What do you mean?

1380
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,117
- Well...
- Who are we talking about?

1381
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,873
Your other half.
You're becoming both the same.

1382
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:30,712
You have to get at Nihal too, right?

1383
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:35,212
I know what you two think of me.
But I don't care.

1384
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:38,468
These are my own thoughts,
nothing to do with Nihal.

1385
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:41,922
She walks around
like she was a guardian angel,

1386
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,305
but in reality, she doesn't do shit.

1387
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:47,726
Glaring at people
with that contemptuous look.

1388
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:50,018
Are we now guilty
because you do nothing?

1389
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,482
Do something. Nobody's stopping you.

1390
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:59,110
Charity's now what they call
showing off in this house.

1391
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:04,614
The salvation ritual of a woman
who's never earned her living.

1392
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:06,246
God knows what salvation.

1393
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:08,621
What do you want her to do?

1394
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:12,291
Philanthropy isn't tossing
a bone to a hungry dog.

1395
01:33:12,963 --> 01:33:15,667
It's sharing it
when you're just as hungry.

1396
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:20,718
Everybody does what he can,
how he can. What's wrong with that?

1397
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:24,338
Ask yourself what you get
from this kind of work.

1398
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,054
You're not listening.
What's that got to do with it?

1399
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:31,936
Others found what you're digging for
in that hole years ago.

1400
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:35,061
Stop flogging a dead horse.

1401
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:38,236
It's a waste of time.
Nothing new will come of it.

1402
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:41,865
So you tell me then.
What is "new"?

1403
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,489
You are the man of ideas, not me.

1404
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:45,859
I can't teach you.

1405
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:49,287
I'm interested in the universal,
even if it might not seem new.

1406
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,323
For God's sake, Aydin.

1407
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,371
Be realistic for once. Please.

1408
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:55,628
Just this once.

1409
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:58,004
Look who's talking about realism.

1410
01:33:58,174 --> 01:34:01,128
Dealing with art, struggling
for people's spiritual development

1411
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:03,260
is alchemy, you say?

1412
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:05,422
No, dear, what I'm saying is this.

1413
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:09,513
If all you thinkers thought
about solving the big problems,

1414
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:14,312
all this trivia you fuss about now
would solve itself in the process.

1415
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:17,563
If you go up in a balloon
to see a town,

1416
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:20,653
you'll incidentally see the trees,
rivers and meadows too.

1417
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:24,026
But no, you focus on one tiny spot.

1418
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,110
Lazy, cowardly, conservative.

1419
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:30,112
We're in an endless cycle again.

1420
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:33,451
We don't have to agree.
Why do we keep arguing?

1421
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,536
You know what your problem is?

1422
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:39,924
In order not to suffer,
you prefer to fool yourself.

1423
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:42,083
Yes, that's it.

1424
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:46,799
But one has to have the courage
to face the truth.

1425
01:34:46,974 --> 01:34:49,678
If you're looking
for something more real,

1426
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:54,928
you'll have to be destructive
when necessary, dear Aydin.

1427
01:34:55,440 --> 01:35:00,944
But since you're an actor, you forgot
about being real, being yourself.

1428
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:06,523
You jump from one personality
to another, just like a grasshopper.

1429
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:10,076
But there's something called
living with yourself.

1430
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:13,663
So, you want me to be realistic?
Alright, listen, then.

1431
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:17,878
You're a person sentenced
to Ioneliness and boredom for life.

1432
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:20,797
Because you're a coward,
because you're lazy.

1433
01:35:21,133 --> 01:35:22,413
- Me?
- Yes.

1434
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:26,211
You're used to living like a parasite
expecting everyone to help you.

1435
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:30,220
You act as if the whole world
owes you something.

1436
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:32,349
- Easy, calm down.
- I'm calm.

1437
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:36,184
Whatever you do, whatever you say,

1438
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:38,064
you expect indulgence.

1439
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:41,732
- You think that's possible?
- That's certainly not what I want.

1440
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,562
Where do you get such ideas?

1441
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:48,731
You're not realistic yourself
without being aware of it.

1442
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,405
- Me?
- Yes.

1443
01:35:50,996 --> 01:35:52,371
Wonderful.

1444
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:56,372
I swear, every time
you come through that door,

1445
01:35:56,543 --> 01:36:00,790
I find myself praying
you won't say something irritating.

1446
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:04,371
While you sit silently behind me,

1447
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:08,596
I feel your gaze on my back, seeking
trouble, just to escape boredom.

1448
01:36:09,139 --> 01:36:10,763
My back goes numb.

1449
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:13,635
I've got unsuspected powers.

1450
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:18,306
It's as if somebody is rubbing
his calloused hand on my back.

1451
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:21,526
I feel cold inside, I can't write.

1452
01:36:21,692 --> 01:36:23,769
Aydin, what are you saying?

1453
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:26,691
Do you always have to be
that irritating?

1454
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:29,189
You're angry.

1455
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:31,609
Look, this drives everybody away.

1456
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:35,831
No husband, no friend, nobody.
You're left all alone.

1457
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:38,709
Am I wrong?

1458
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:43,295
Is that realistic enough,
or shall I continue?

1459
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:47,296
Yes, that was a very
personal realism. You're right.

1460
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:50,711
Thinking more important than action.

1461
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:54,760
There we go.

1462
01:36:55,227 --> 01:36:57,931
The age-old excuse
of cowards and slackers.

1463
01:36:58,104 --> 01:37:00,013
Are you counting on that?

1464
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:04,058
Marvelous tirade.

1465
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:15,840
- Hi.
- Hello.

1466
01:38:16,015 --> 01:38:17,973
- How are you?
- I'm alright, thanks. How are you?

1467
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:19,803
I'm fine, thank you.

1468
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:23,059
I want to check out. Just now.

1469
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,642
Oh, really?

1470
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:30,770
Because we want to leave
tomorrow morning so early.

1471
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:33,364
You're leaving already.

1472
01:38:33,824 --> 01:38:37,158
- I see. So soon?
- Well, sorry.

1473
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:40,613
- We're going to miss you.
- Thank you.

1474
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:43,363
- Did you enjoy your stay here?
- Yes, of course.

1475
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:44,959
Did you have a nice time?

1476
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:48,461
Yes. I'm so... I'm very happy
to stay here.

1477
01:38:48,632 --> 01:38:50,209
It's a very nice room.

1478
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:52,376
Good, good. I'm glad.

1479
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,860
- How are you, man?
- Hey, how are you?

1480
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:00,660
I didn't know you were coming.

1481
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:02,746
I invited Mr Suavi.

1482
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:04,906
So I figured.

1483
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,458
Is there a celebration?

1484
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:10,880
No, we're just having a meeting.

1485
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:12,707
- A meeting?
- Yes.

1486
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:17,128
What's the mystery?
Is it an army council meeting?

1487
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:19,386
Didn't I tell you? I did.

1488
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,092
When?

1489
01:40:22,808 --> 01:40:25,560
I don't know, but I did.
You said "hmm" or something.

1490
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:28,225
It was odd
that you weren't interested.

1491
01:40:28,606 --> 01:40:31,642
I said "hmm"? I don't remember.

1492
01:40:32,651 --> 01:40:35,855
Never mind. It's nothing to do
with you anyway.

1493
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,608
As if you didn't know.

1494
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:44,740
- Nihal.
- Yes?

1495
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:46,706
Where exactly did you tell me?

1496
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:48,249
I don't remember.

1497
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:53,337
You heard,
it's none of your business!

1498
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:58,298
Shall I take your coat, Mr Aydin?

1499
01:41:01,097 --> 01:41:02,176
Where's Necla?

1500
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:04,264
In her room.

1501
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,339
Why? Is she upset?

1502
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:09,099
No. Do you want me to go and see?

1503
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:10,814
No. Did she come down today?

1504
01:41:10,982 --> 01:41:12,856
Probably.

1505
01:41:13,026 --> 01:41:15,101
In what sense you ask?

1506
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:17,820
Nothing. Off you go.

1507
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:22,816
So?

1508
01:41:23,286 --> 01:41:25,611
I thought you never went out.

1509
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:27,283
I don't really.

1510
01:41:27,456 --> 01:41:30,956
Nihal called me,
I couldn't say no.

1511
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:37,621
Listen...

1512
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:40,000
Don't let them fleece you.

1513
01:41:40,178 --> 01:41:42,716
They're insatiable.
And you can't say no.

1514
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:45,634
Look at me.
Do I look that gullible?

1515
01:41:46,059 --> 01:41:48,514
I'm just warning you.
You're an old friend.

1516
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:51,438
Don't regret it later
and take it out on me.

1517
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,681
Fatma, could you get me a coffee?

1518
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,767
I'll have a coffee and leave.

1519
01:41:55,944 --> 01:41:59,988
- Why do you have to go? Stay.
- No, I don't fancy it.

1520
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:03,609
- Why don't you stay for a while?
- No thanks.

1521
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,171
- Welcome, Levent.
- Hello, everyone.

1522
01:42:21,344 --> 01:42:23,003
- How are you?
- Fine.

1523
01:42:23,179 --> 01:42:24,210
Give me your coat.

1524
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:28,089
Teacher, where were you?
I was about to leave.

1525
01:42:28,268 --> 01:42:31,968
At the army office.
The commandant's wife was there.

1526
01:42:32,147 --> 01:42:32,892
So?

1527
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:35,513
People are nice
to their wives in public.

1528
01:42:35,692 --> 01:42:37,933
But given the chance,

1529
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:42,440
they'd stuff them in bags
and throw them in the water.

1530
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:47,276
Hello. I'm Aydin, Nihal's husband.

1531
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:51,285
Are you? Nice to meet you.
I'm Levent, the teacher.

1532
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:53,533
- I guessed so.
- Really? How?

1533
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:56,415
You come often.
I've heard about you.

1534
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,160
I'm not sure what you're doing...

1535
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:02,751
Mrs Nihal could explain it better,

1536
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:09,297
but we're collecting donations
to renovate disadvantaged schools.

1537
01:43:09,476 --> 01:43:12,891
Since Mrs Nihal joined,
we've made a lot of progress.

1538
01:43:13,062 --> 01:43:15,767
- That's nice. Bravo.
- Thank you.

1539
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:18,063
Friends, why don't you sit down?

1540
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:19,432
Please.

1541
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:27,362
Levent, what would you like to drink?

1542
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:32,031
Some of your famous
coffee liquor, please.

1543
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:34,531
Of course. Anyone else?

1544
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:36,283
Mr Suavi?

1545
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,583
Me too, but later.

1546
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:44,336
I'll have a tea, Nihal. Thanks.

1547
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:53,637
Listen, Blent.

1548
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:56,219
How many local primary schools
are there?

1549
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:58,473
Levent, not Blent.

1550
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:03,232
There are three in the center.

1551
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:05,064
And how many pupils?

1552
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:08,075
Well, we have 75...

1553
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:11,150
plus 150 there.
250-300 in all. Why?

1554
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:14,745
That's not many.
I thought there would be more.

1555
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,956
Look, it's snowing!

1556
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:22,747
If it goes on, it'll be difficult
to drive up the slope.

1557
01:44:22,924 --> 01:44:23,919
Aydin...

1558
01:44:25,426 --> 01:44:29,091
Can you come? There's a problem
with a light in the kitchen.

1559
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:31,431
Coming.

1560
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:44,277
Which one is it? This one?

1561
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:48,196
Sorry, that was just an excuse
to bring you here.

1562
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:52,324
Now, don't take it badly but...

1563
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:55,745
I must say this is a private meeting.

1564
01:44:56,999 --> 01:44:58,078
So?

1565
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:03,004
In this meeting,
we'll try to finalize

1566
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:06,667
months of effort.

1567
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:09,298
So?

1568
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,132
I'll have to ask you
to leave us alone.

1569
01:45:14,475 --> 01:45:16,218
Discuss whatever you like.

1570
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:18,768
Are you hiding something from me?

1571
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:21,144
It's not a matter of secrecy.

1572
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:26,192
But Nihal, don't you think
you're being a bit impolite?

1573
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:28,070
Why "impolite"?

1574
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:31,525
All I'm saying is
that this is a private meeting.

1575
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:34,274
Nobody in this country
would believe it.

1576
01:45:34,453 --> 01:45:36,659
Men everywhere
but the husband banned.

1577
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:38,490
Don't be ridiculous.

1578
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:42,366
There are women inside.
And some more will come.

1579
01:45:42,545 --> 01:45:46,245
But with you around,
things get complicated, that's all.

1580
01:45:46,424 --> 01:45:48,499
You stick your nose into everything.

1581
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:52,713
Just let us do things our own way.

1582
01:45:53,723 --> 01:45:57,850
If I organized a meeting like this
and you came in,

1583
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:01,138
I'd never treat you like this.

1584
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:04,349
I really don't get it.

1585
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:07,024
It's beyond my understanding.

1586
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:09,187
We've been working for a year now.

1587
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:13,907
You never showed the slightest
interest and you show up at the end.

1588
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:16,152
I'm the one who doesn't get
what you're after.

1589
01:46:16,329 --> 01:46:17,822
I'm not after anything.

1590
01:46:29,175 --> 01:46:32,211
I'd have soon got it and left anyway.

1591
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:36,596
What makes me angry is your nerve

1592
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:38,968
to actually tell me this.

1593
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:41,592
I didn't say it in front of people.

1594
01:46:41,771 --> 01:46:45,305
I asked you to come here
and I'm asking you nicely.

1595
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:47,389
What else can I do?

1596
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:49,027
I don't know.

1597
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:52,862
But I know very well that I'd never
do such a thing to you.

1598
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:55,240
That's for sure.

1599
01:46:56,661 --> 01:46:59,116
Playing the old scenes over again.

1600
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:01,910
I can't stand it.

1601
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:05,668
Alright, then.

1602
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:07,795
Have it your way.

1603
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:10,663
I'll leave, you can stay.

1604
01:48:14,072 --> 01:48:15,565
What's up?

1605
01:48:18,784 --> 01:48:21,240
- I'm leaving.
- So soon?

1606
01:48:21,412 --> 01:48:23,618
When you've got to go,
you've got to go.

1607
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:26,541
There might be black ice.
Could be dangerous.

1608
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:28,452
I don't mind.

1609
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:30,544
We love danger.

1610
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:32,751
Awesome.

1611
01:48:33,799 --> 01:48:36,716
- So where are you heading?
- We'll see.

1612
01:48:37,428 --> 01:48:39,255
Wherever the road takes me.

1613
01:48:40,389 --> 01:48:42,014
Was Hidayet downstairs?

1614
01:48:42,808 --> 01:48:45,928
- Yes, I checked out with him.
- No, that's not what I meant.

1615
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:49,302
Do you need anything?
Food for the road?

1616
01:48:49,524 --> 01:48:50,851
No, thank you.

1617
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:54,391
Anyway...

1618
01:48:55,071 --> 01:48:56,233
Fine.

1619
01:48:58,908 --> 01:49:01,944
- Have a safe journey.
- Thank you.

1620
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:03,199
Don't forget us.

1621
01:49:26,351 --> 01:49:28,677
Nihal, am I disturbing you?

1622
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:32,689
Don't hide it, I won't look.

1623
01:49:32,858 --> 01:49:34,851
I just wanted to ask something.

1624
01:49:35,027 --> 01:49:36,023
Then ask, Aydin.

1625
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:41,652
I heard you raised funds last night.

1626
01:49:42,743 --> 01:49:44,071
Is that true?

1627
01:49:44,245 --> 01:49:46,913
Yes, we did. So what?

1628
01:49:47,915 --> 01:49:49,872
Why didn't you tell me?

1629
01:49:50,543 --> 01:49:51,870
Did I have to?

1630
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:59,125
You didn't have to,
but I'd have appreciated it.

1631
01:49:59,302 --> 01:50:02,386
I might have wanted
to make a significant contribution.

1632
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:05,212
I don't think it's a good idea.

1633
01:50:06,768 --> 01:50:08,806
We're doing fine on our own.

1634
01:50:08,978 --> 01:50:10,389
We don't need you, thanks.

1635
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:12,271
Come on.

1636
01:50:13,315 --> 01:50:15,273
One always needs more.

1637
01:50:16,193 --> 01:50:18,352
After all, I'm a wealthy man.

1638
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:22,237
What's more natural
than helping an educational project?

1639
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:25,317
But nobody expects
anything from you.

1640
01:50:25,495 --> 01:50:28,531
From you neither, darling.

1641
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:32,620
Yet you created a huge committee
in our house without me knowing.

1642
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:33,706
Didn't you?

1643
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:35,955
Listen to me, Aydin, please.

1644
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:38,754
We've lived in peace
for two years,

1645
01:50:38,924 --> 01:50:41,166
each to his own affairs.

1646
01:50:41,343 --> 01:50:42,967
What's suddenly changed?

1647
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:48,885
Yesterday your aim was
to humiliate me and the guests.

1648
01:50:49,351 --> 01:50:51,807
- Think I didn't notice?
- Me?

1649
01:50:51,979 --> 01:50:53,474
Never even crossed my mind.

1650
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:55,142
Come on, for God's sake.

1651
01:50:55,316 --> 01:50:57,888
I was so angry,
I couldn't sleep last night.

1652
01:50:59,278 --> 01:51:03,406
If we start fighting and quarreling
again like we used to,

1653
01:51:03,573 --> 01:51:05,899
then it's clear I can't stay here.

1654
01:51:21,717 --> 01:51:24,837
- Is that a threat?
- Why would I threaten you?

1655
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:27,345
I'm just saying what could happen.

1656
01:51:30,226 --> 01:51:32,182
OK, say you left.

1657
01:51:32,687 --> 01:51:34,014
Where would you go?

1658
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:36,643
Wherever I could. I don't know.

1659
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:37,978
I'd go to Istanbul.

1660
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:40,937
Find a job and work.

1661
01:51:46,283 --> 01:51:47,991
Nihal, my darling.

1662
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:53,826
You haven't got tired of banging
the same old drum for years.

1663
01:51:55,126 --> 01:51:57,498
As if I'm keeping you here by force.

1664
01:51:59,964 --> 01:52:02,633
I've never stopped you, have I?

1665
01:52:03,134 --> 01:52:07,001
Go whenever you like.
Maybe you should. Try it.

1666
01:52:07,513 --> 01:52:09,635
Find a job, with the minimum wage.

1667
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:12,134
From 8 to 6.

1668
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:16,885
After work, you can go on saving
the world, if you have energy left.

1669
01:52:17,398 --> 01:52:19,022
I'll do it if necessary.

1670
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:22,600
Much better than wasting my life

1671
01:52:22,778 --> 01:52:25,447
living like a parasite
with an arrogant man like you.

1672
01:52:26,866 --> 01:52:29,617
Thanks to you,
I'm drifting in vain here.

1673
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:33,447
I'm sponging off you.
I spend your money.

1674
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:37,786
But I pay for it with my freedom
and my useless loyalty.

1675
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:42,630
Do you know how donating even a
little of someone else's money feels?

1676
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:43,793
No, I don't.

1677
01:52:44,717 --> 01:52:45,747
And why?

1678
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:49,425
Because I've worked like a dog
all my life not to know.

1679
01:52:51,223 --> 01:52:53,892
I couldn't enjoy
my childhood or youth.

1680
01:52:58,272 --> 01:53:01,225
Too much of an easy life,
that's your trouble.

1681
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:05,189
You have no idea
what gratitude means.

1682
01:53:18,834 --> 01:53:20,874
Besides, I'm asking you...

1683
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:26,295
Stop these secret meetings
and gatherings at my house.

1684
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:30,718
I only allow close acquaintances
into my house.

1685
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:36,510
If that lot want to do charity work,
they should find somewhere else.

1686
01:53:38,145 --> 01:53:42,225
Nobody can come here yelling away
in the middle of the night.

1687
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:44,060
I won't allow it.

1688
01:53:48,364 --> 01:53:51,364
And that bum of a teacher
doesn't give a damn.

1689
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:54,357
The school needs this or that.

1690
01:53:55,453 --> 01:54:00,282
His real aim is to trap
bored neurotics like you.

1691
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:50,248
Why don't you understand me, Nihal?

1692
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:55,678
Why are you being unfair?

1693
01:54:57,558 --> 01:55:01,555
I swear my only intention
when I showed up

1694
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:04,685
was to help you, support you.

1695
01:55:04,857 --> 01:55:07,893
Please leave me alone, Aydin.
I'm begging you.

1696
01:55:08,402 --> 01:55:12,067
Let's stay away from each other
for a while. You go or me.

1697
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,362
Or let's break up, I don't know.

1698
01:55:16,118 --> 01:55:18,193
OK, why all the shouting?

1699
01:55:19,746 --> 01:55:21,538
I'm going anyway.

1700
01:55:22,541 --> 01:55:24,664
I made this decision some time ago.

1701
01:55:26,294 --> 01:55:28,122
I'm off to Istanbul for a while.

1702
01:55:29,673 --> 01:55:32,343
I have things to do for my book, too.

1703
01:55:33,052 --> 01:55:36,136
But I have doubts
about your donations campaign.

1704
01:55:37,097 --> 01:55:38,722
I find it very important.

1705
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:40,599
I can't leave before sorting it out.

1706
01:55:41,518 --> 01:55:43,843
So please, let's just sit.

1707
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:47,231
And talk calmly
like two civilized people, OK?

1708
01:55:47,733 --> 01:55:49,275
Come on, please.

1709
01:56:02,748 --> 01:56:05,915
Nihal, I'm asking you kindly.
Come and sit here.

1710
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:09,618
Come on.

1711
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,508
Nihal, will you come over here?

1712
01:57:03,683 --> 01:57:06,305
Nihal, darling...

1713
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:12,391
It's obvious you started
such an organization

1714
01:57:12,568 --> 01:57:15,141
because of your love of people

1715
01:57:15,821 --> 01:57:18,525
and your conscientiousness.

1716
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:20,822
I'm not looking for a conspiracy.

1717
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:23,697
In fact, I will support you
all the way.

1718
01:57:25,581 --> 01:57:29,910
Although I respect your intelligence
and your feelings,

1719
01:57:30,085 --> 01:57:32,043
especially your feelings,

1720
01:57:33,338 --> 01:57:37,586
I can't allow such a tricky business
which could cause us

1721
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:41,259
big problems we can't predict now

1722
01:57:41,429 --> 01:57:45,593
to be ruined at the hands of you
and those rascals.

1723
01:57:47,269 --> 01:57:49,262
However pure your intentions.

1724
01:57:50,064 --> 01:57:54,441
Remember "The road to hell
is paved with good intentions."

1725
01:57:56,862 --> 01:57:59,269
For a start, you've no experience.

1726
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:01,650
You know nothing of life.

1727
01:58:01,825 --> 01:58:03,617
You're too impetuous.

1728
01:58:03,786 --> 01:58:05,742
You are easily deceived.

1729
01:58:06,288 --> 01:58:08,530
You trust people instantly.

1730
01:58:09,875 --> 01:58:13,290
You've gathered all these
strange assistants around you.

1731
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:16,543
This is very dangerous business,
Nihal.

1732
01:58:17,382 --> 01:58:20,502
To tell you the truth,

1733
01:58:21,178 --> 01:58:25,389
under these conditions, any efforts
will lead to two bad outcomes.

1734
01:58:25,932 --> 01:58:30,559
First, nothing gets done
for the schools.

1735
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:35,106
Second, you'll lose a fortune
because of all the shoddy work.

1736
01:58:35,275 --> 01:58:37,018
And your name will be stained.

1737
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:39,946
One can say the money
doesn't matter. I can cover it.

1738
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:43,068
But what about your name, our name?

1739
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:46,025
Once things get out of hand,

1740
01:58:46,202 --> 01:58:49,322
you can't imagine all the gossip.

1741
01:58:49,497 --> 01:58:53,330
They'll all accuse us
of embezzling the donations.

1742
01:58:53,502 --> 01:58:55,541
And you'll suddenly be all alone.

1743
01:58:55,712 --> 01:58:57,207
They'll all vanish.

1744
01:58:57,381 --> 01:58:58,709
And we'll get blamed.

1745
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:00,922
Just get to the point.

1746
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:03,463
My point is this.

1747
01:59:03,636 --> 01:59:06,093
I was glad
you were collecting donations.

1748
01:59:06,264 --> 01:59:08,590
But to be honest, I was worried too.

1749
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:12,844
You need more than enthusiasm
in this kind of affair.

1750
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:16,649
So I felt the urge to step in,

1751
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:20,067
so we don't have problems
in the future.

1752
01:59:20,486 --> 01:59:22,859
- The urge?
- Yes.

1753
01:59:23,865 --> 01:59:28,657
Otherwise, I'd have gone to Istanbul.
But I can't until I sort this out.

1754
01:59:29,204 --> 01:59:32,537
This is a risky business, Nihal.
It's not a game.

1755
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:36,832
There have been
all these fraud cases recently

1756
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,958
and all the new laws.
Do you know them?

1757
01:59:40,173 --> 01:59:42,462
Get to the point.
What do you want?

1758
01:59:42,967 --> 01:59:46,503
I want to see
all the donations and expenditures.

1759
01:59:47,889 --> 01:59:52,018
And the list of your helpers.

1760
01:59:52,186 --> 01:59:56,515
I am sure they're trustworthy,
but better safe than sorry.

1761
01:59:57,107 --> 01:59:59,099
Are you serious?

1762
01:59:59,276 --> 02:00:03,274
Nihal, let's be reasonable, please.

1763
02:00:03,446 --> 02:00:06,780
Don't you trust my experience,
and my honesty?

1764
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:11,408
I'm still not sure what you're after.

1765
02:00:11,746 --> 02:00:14,118
What could I be after?

1766
02:00:14,666 --> 02:00:16,789
What could I possibly be after?

1767
02:00:17,961 --> 02:00:21,295
I'm just trying to prevent
any problems for my family.

1768
02:00:21,464 --> 02:00:23,089
I have the right, don't I?

1769
02:00:27,429 --> 02:00:28,460
Now...

1770
02:00:31,641 --> 02:00:34,892
Let me see the donations
and your expenses.

1771
02:00:35,062 --> 02:00:38,182
It'll take me a minute
to spot any problems.

1772
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:41,645
I just want to see your situation.

1773
02:00:41,818 --> 02:00:44,938
I have nothing to hide.
Anyone can look.

1774
02:00:45,114 --> 02:00:46,857
There they are, take a look.

1775
02:00:51,452 --> 02:00:52,912
These?

1776
02:01:12,224 --> 02:01:15,593
I'm sorry but I don't understand
any of this.

1777
02:01:16,352 --> 02:01:19,140
Don't you have a table
showing donations?

1778
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:21,806
We have the signed documents.

1779
02:01:25,445 --> 02:01:28,232
Nihal, dearest...

1780
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,826
It's obvious you haven't a clue.

1781
02:01:31,993 --> 02:01:34,484
How is that possible?

1782
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:40,123
How come you don't have a chart
showing everything at once?

1783
02:01:44,506 --> 02:01:48,669
You should also have a copy
of the receipts for donations.

1784
02:01:48,843 --> 02:01:50,041
Do you have them?

1785
02:01:50,637 --> 02:01:51,633
No.

1786
02:01:53,264 --> 02:01:57,428
For money or goods in kind,

1787
02:01:57,602 --> 02:02:01,185
you have to prepare
an invoice or receipt.

1788
02:02:01,356 --> 02:02:03,147
Have they been issued?

1789
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:04,858
I don't think so.

1790
02:02:05,944 --> 02:02:07,652
But all this is very important.

1791
02:02:08,196 --> 02:02:09,477
Very important.

1792
02:02:10,991 --> 02:02:15,569
What if they want to deduct
the donation from taxes?

1793
02:02:17,748 --> 02:02:20,239
Or if they try to dodge taxes?

1794
02:02:20,416 --> 02:02:23,334
You'd get blamed and end up in jail.

1795
02:02:23,504 --> 02:02:29,043
Sorry but these are
very important details.

1796
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:34,304
Another thing. Receipts should be
numbered and listed separately.

1797
02:02:34,472 --> 02:02:35,967
Has that been done?

1798
02:02:36,391 --> 02:02:37,720
I don't think so.

1799
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:42,055
Never mind. I'll start doing that,
to save you worrying.

1800
02:02:43,648 --> 02:02:44,846
Yes, do so.

1801
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:46,603
Do as you wish.

1802
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:50,441
Alright.

1803
02:02:51,739 --> 02:02:54,147
Then let's do it like this.

1804
02:02:55,202 --> 02:03:00,540
Let me take this pile of books
and papers to my study.

1805
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:04,835
I have some software,
I'll run them through.

1806
02:03:05,294 --> 02:03:09,375
I'll let you know my thoughts
once I've had a good look. OK?

1807
02:03:12,678 --> 02:03:14,171
Is this part of it, too?

1808
02:03:17,223 --> 02:03:18,303
Alright.

1809
02:03:20,686 --> 02:03:24,268
Are you sure that's it?
If there's more, let me take it.

1810
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:25,930
Take them.

1811
02:03:28,235 --> 02:03:30,310
Take them all. Don't leave anything.

1812
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:34,486
That was all I had left in life.
You can have them too.

1813
02:03:35,492 --> 02:03:37,283
Take everything I have.

1814
02:03:38,036 --> 02:03:41,203
Dear Nihal,
why are you talking like that?

1815
02:03:41,372 --> 02:03:42,404
Take them all.

1816
02:03:44,209 --> 02:03:46,581
Take them, they can all be yours.

1817
02:03:47,044 --> 02:03:48,670
Take these too.

1818
02:03:51,633 --> 02:03:52,415
Here.

1819
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:54,881
- Take them.
- What are you doing?

1820
02:04:18,242 --> 02:04:20,948
Oh, my dear Nihal.

1821
02:04:23,331 --> 02:04:26,036
You're acting like a child.

1822
02:04:26,543 --> 02:04:28,084
What can I say?

1823
02:04:29,003 --> 02:04:31,838
When you understand
how important this is,

1824
02:04:32,006 --> 02:04:34,249
you'll come and thank me.

1825
02:04:35,844 --> 02:04:37,386
Wait and see.

1826
02:05:29,481 --> 02:05:31,307
Nihal, listen.

1827
02:05:32,275 --> 02:05:34,980
Here are all your documents back.

1828
02:05:35,821 --> 02:05:37,896
I didn't look at them much.

1829
02:05:38,823 --> 02:05:40,946
Because I've changed my mind.

1830
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:45,196
I'm not going to get involved,
stick my nose in.

1831
02:05:48,250 --> 02:05:51,167
To tell the truth,
I felt a little bit lazy.

1832
02:05:51,378 --> 02:05:55,327
I have enough work already.
So, you do whatever suits you.

1833
02:05:58,844 --> 02:06:02,888
In the meantime, I'm leaving
tomorrow. I've decided to go.

1834
02:06:03,932 --> 02:06:06,054
At least till the end of winter.

1835
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:10,094
The hotel's never too busy in winter.
Hidayet is here.

1836
02:06:11,231 --> 02:06:13,140
Tomorrow I'm going to Istanbul.

1837
02:06:20,865 --> 02:06:22,574
Nihal, cut it out, for God's sake!

1838
02:06:23,576 --> 02:06:25,782
I said I'm leaving,
what more do you want?

1839
02:06:28,414 --> 02:06:31,166
Your altruism
brings tears to my eyes.

1840
02:06:56,317 --> 02:06:57,860
Do you remember?

1841
02:06:59,696 --> 02:07:01,569
You once told me

1842
02:07:02,031 --> 02:07:05,567
that if I could change
some of my behavior,

1843
02:07:07,078 --> 02:07:09,237
you would forgive me completely.

1844
02:07:09,372 --> 02:07:10,652
Remember?

1845
02:07:12,709 --> 02:07:14,251
Which means...

1846
02:07:16,171 --> 02:07:18,163
for you I'm guilty of something.

1847
02:07:22,427 --> 02:07:24,051
Therefore,

1848
02:07:25,763 --> 02:07:29,678
calmly and briefly,

1849
02:07:30,435 --> 02:07:33,222
in terms I can understand,

1850
02:07:33,354 --> 02:07:35,394
I ask you to tell me

1851
02:07:35,564 --> 02:07:37,225
what I'm guilty of.

1852
02:07:46,493 --> 02:07:49,066
I'm too tired, I can't talk now.

1853
02:07:49,621 --> 02:07:51,080
Later maybe.

1854
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:56,373
What kind of guilt is that?

1855
02:07:58,629 --> 02:08:00,124
What have I done to you?

1856
02:08:02,341 --> 02:08:05,925
Is that you're young, beautiful
and would like to live your life?

1857
02:08:06,429 --> 02:08:10,130
I'm much older than you
and you hate me for that?

1858
02:08:11,184 --> 02:08:12,262
Is that my guilt?

1859
02:08:15,063 --> 02:08:17,518
I didn't force you to marry me.

1860
02:08:19,775 --> 02:08:21,982
I never restricted your freedom.

1861
02:08:23,196 --> 02:08:27,110
You live as you wish, independently,
in your part of the house.

1862
02:08:28,576 --> 02:08:32,028
You have even set up
a huge committee here.

1863
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:37,293
If you want even more freedom,
it's yours.

1864
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:39,120
No one's stopping you.

1865
02:08:39,837 --> 02:08:40,916
I mean it.

1866
02:08:42,507 --> 02:08:45,674
If you want a divorce,
I won't stop you either.

1867
02:08:59,315 --> 02:09:01,225
I don't want anything like that.

1868
02:09:03,194 --> 02:09:05,650
Of course, I wanted to marry you.

1869
02:09:08,116 --> 02:09:10,986
It's not that I'm young,
and you're old,

1870
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:14,280
or I could love someone else
if I was free.

1871
02:09:16,875 --> 02:09:20,243
I always felt
I'm older than you anyway.

1872
02:09:23,631 --> 02:09:25,956
But you're an unbearable man.

1873
02:09:27,134 --> 02:09:30,219
You are selfish, spiteful, cynical.

1874
02:09:31,806 --> 02:09:33,264
That's what you're guilty of.

1875
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,853
Possible.
Maybe I'm like that, I don't know.

1876
02:09:42,024 --> 02:09:46,568
At least I can admit my mistakes
from time to time.

1877
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:51,572
But I've never once seen you
take the blame for anything.

1878
02:09:51,743 --> 02:09:52,656
Am I wrong?

1879
02:09:52,827 --> 02:09:55,697
If you intend to nag all night,
I should let you know,

1880
02:09:55,872 --> 02:09:58,789
I don't have the strength
to answer back anymore.

1881
02:09:58,958 --> 02:10:01,165
I don't want to nag at all.

1882
02:10:01,877 --> 02:10:04,001
But I have to ask again.

1883
02:10:04,172 --> 02:10:06,413
I need to know.

1884
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:09,341
What am I guilty of?

1885
02:10:11,638 --> 02:10:13,511
What kind of guilt is it?

1886
02:10:14,266 --> 02:10:16,009
What have I done to you?

1887
02:10:18,394 --> 02:10:19,592
True.

1888
02:10:22,273 --> 02:10:24,681
You're actually a well-educated,

1889
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:26,522
honest,

1890
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:29,525
fair and conscientious man.

1891
02:10:30,448 --> 02:10:34,315
Generally you are like that.
I won't deny it.

1892
02:10:36,370 --> 02:10:39,621
But you sometimes use these virtues
to suffocate people,

1893
02:10:39,833 --> 02:10:42,834
to crush and humiliate them.

1894
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:48,539
Your high principles make you
hate the whole world.

1895
02:10:50,051 --> 02:10:52,044
You hate believers,

1896
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:56,680
because for you, believing is a sign
of underdevelopment and ignorance.

1897
02:10:57,558 --> 02:11:02,434
But you also hate non-believers
for their lack of faith or ideals.

1898
02:11:04,482 --> 02:11:06,356
You dislike the old

1899
02:11:06,859 --> 02:11:10,394
for being conservative bigots
and not thinking freely.

1900
02:11:11,447 --> 02:11:14,199
And you dislike the young
for thinking freely

1901
02:11:14,992 --> 02:11:17,530
and abandoning the traditions.

1902
02:11:19,121 --> 02:11:22,905
You defend the virtues of community.

1903
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:29,371
But you suspect everyone
of being a thief or a bandit,

1904
02:11:29,632 --> 02:11:31,459
so you hate the people, too.

1905
02:11:33,094 --> 02:11:35,134
You hate practically everybody.

1906
02:11:37,223 --> 02:11:38,634
Just once,

1907
02:11:39,725 --> 02:11:43,557
I'd like you to defend something
that might cost you

1908
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:48,190
and have feelings
that don't benefit yourself.

1909
02:11:51,612 --> 02:11:53,155
But that's not possible.

1910
02:12:02,748 --> 02:12:06,164
In the past, you stopped us
splitting up, using various methods.

1911
02:12:09,464 --> 02:12:11,752
Well, maybe it worked both ways.

1912
02:12:13,218 --> 02:12:15,127
I was too young to leave.

1913
02:12:17,054 --> 02:12:19,427
I didn't have the courage
or the money.

1914
02:12:20,349 --> 02:12:22,638
Or anywhere better to go.

1915
02:12:25,563 --> 02:12:28,564
But didn't you feel any remorse

1916
02:12:28,733 --> 02:12:32,184
seeing a young, healthy,
proud, lively woman

1917
02:12:32,737 --> 02:12:34,563
wither away

1918
02:12:34,989 --> 02:12:39,449
in emptiness, boredom and fear?

1919
02:12:41,996 --> 02:12:44,155
I felt fear in our first years.

1920
02:12:45,458 --> 02:12:47,616
Now I feel ashamed.

1921
02:12:52,131 --> 02:12:54,419
My best years have been wasted.

1922
02:12:55,217 --> 02:12:58,882
I shed all my good qualities
to struggle with you.

1923
02:13:01,015 --> 02:13:05,012
I've become tough,
coarse, timid and suspicious.

1924
02:13:09,565 --> 02:13:11,522
What else can I say?

1925
02:13:14,403 --> 02:13:17,689
I'm not even sure
I could express anything.

1926
02:13:23,871 --> 02:13:26,788
But our paths have now parted
even if it's under one roof.

1927
02:13:28,042 --> 02:13:29,951
We should each go our own way.

1928
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:42,137
We could've had a better life.

1929
02:13:45,059 --> 02:13:46,850
But it's too late now.

1930
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:53,230
You wouldn't know, but...

1931
02:13:53,401 --> 02:13:57,862
people like me who grew up in
villages with not even electricity,

1932
02:13:59,574 --> 02:14:02,408
understand the joy and pleasure

1933
02:14:02,952 --> 02:14:06,285
of being in a small,
warm, cosy room like this,

1934
02:14:06,664 --> 02:14:08,206
listening to my wife's voice,

1935
02:14:08,374 --> 02:14:12,917
even if she is screaming
in my face how bad I am.

1936
02:14:18,467 --> 02:14:20,840
Our youth was very dull, Nihal.

1937
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:25,171
We didn't know how to be happy.

1938
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:28,638
So we may not know
how to make others happy.

1939
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:33,063
But as I said,

1940
02:14:33,566 --> 02:14:35,558
we had no bad intentions.

1941
02:14:37,194 --> 02:14:41,488
We set out with good intentions,
pure, innocent dreams.

1942
02:14:43,492 --> 02:14:45,532
We wanted a better life and society.

1943
02:14:45,703 --> 02:14:47,661
Sorry, but I don't believe you.

1944
02:14:48,248 --> 02:14:50,868
I've heard it all before.
You're not on stage anymore.

1945
02:14:52,334 --> 02:14:54,659
We all start with good intentions.

1946
02:14:55,088 --> 02:14:59,714
But as you said, the road to hell
is paved with good intentions.

1947
02:15:00,051 --> 02:15:02,339
So all this means nothing.

1948
02:15:02,512 --> 02:15:05,429
All these fine words
sound ridiculous to me now.

1949
02:15:06,808 --> 02:15:09,215
When you start talking like this,

1950
02:15:09,394 --> 02:15:14,435
I feel like you're pulling
trick number two to get your way.

1951
02:15:16,192 --> 02:15:20,106
Yet I've never understood
what you really want from me.

1952
02:15:20,863 --> 02:15:22,523
Even so,

1953
02:15:23,074 --> 02:15:25,149
I'll ask you one more time.

1954
02:15:26,744 --> 02:15:28,784
Whatever you call my activity,

1955
02:15:28,954 --> 02:15:32,205
self-deception or feminine logic,

1956
02:15:33,126 --> 02:15:35,000
leave me alone.

1957
02:15:36,087 --> 02:15:39,041
Because this is my only consolation.

1958
02:15:43,886 --> 02:15:46,459
I spent my entire youth
fighting with you.

1959
02:15:47,265 --> 02:15:51,890
Now, thanks to this work,
I believe in myself again.

1960
02:15:52,937 --> 02:15:56,222
I have found a meaning
to my dull life here.

1961
02:15:56,733 --> 02:15:59,519
A purpose that makes me feel proud.

1962
02:16:01,445 --> 02:16:03,569
So, at least allow me that.

1963
02:16:06,576 --> 02:16:08,069
Nihal, darling.

1964
02:16:09,453 --> 02:16:11,909
You're a good-hearted,

1965
02:16:12,081 --> 02:16:15,331
smart, rational, sensible woman.

1966
02:16:16,627 --> 02:16:19,831
Everything you say and do
is very reasonable.

1967
02:16:20,005 --> 02:16:21,583
It really is.

1968
02:16:23,675 --> 02:16:24,707
But...

1969
02:16:25,803 --> 02:16:29,137
not seeing a man for what he is,
idolizing him like a god,

1970
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:32,304
and then being mad at him,

1971
02:16:32,434 --> 02:16:34,842
because he's not a god.

1972
02:16:36,606 --> 02:16:38,349
Do you think that's fair?

1973
02:16:46,073 --> 02:16:51,316
I wish I were the successful,
charismatic actor you dreamed of.

1974
02:16:52,413 --> 02:16:53,907
But I am not.

1975
02:16:55,541 --> 02:16:57,201
I'm a simple man.

1976
02:16:59,503 --> 02:17:02,457
And what's worse,
I'd like to stay that way.

1977
02:17:06,344 --> 02:17:08,003
Anyway...

1978
02:17:08,179 --> 02:17:10,088
I'm leaving in the morning.

1979
02:17:10,765 --> 02:17:13,433
Don't worry, I won't be back
before spring.

1980
02:17:15,394 --> 02:17:16,853
But give me that list,

1981
02:17:18,522 --> 02:17:21,393
so I can make a small donation.

1982
02:17:22,026 --> 02:17:25,311
Do as you please. I don't care.

1983
02:17:26,113 --> 02:17:28,818
The list is there,
write what you want.

1984
02:18:06,863 --> 02:18:09,068
I signed it an anonymous donor.

1985
02:18:13,994 --> 02:18:15,737
And left the money here.

1986
02:18:16,706 --> 02:18:17,904
Alright?

1987
02:18:23,462 --> 02:18:25,953
I hope things turn out
as you'd like.

1988
02:18:27,967 --> 02:18:30,007
Do as you want.

1989
02:18:31,721 --> 02:18:34,971
And don't forget I'm there
if you need any help.

1990
02:18:38,603 --> 02:18:41,473
But beware of that teacher.

1991
02:18:42,189 --> 02:18:45,440
He looked like the sneaky,
scheming type to me.

1992
02:18:45,609 --> 02:18:47,982
I can smell his kind a mile away.

1993
02:18:49,363 --> 02:18:52,150
I suggest you work with people

1994
02:18:52,366 --> 02:18:56,031
who are conscientious, principled
and have moral sense.

1995
02:18:57,371 --> 02:18:59,862
One day, you'll understand better.

1996
02:19:03,544 --> 02:19:05,252
Conscience. Morals.

1997
02:19:06,213 --> 02:19:08,420
Ideals, principles.

1998
02:19:08,591 --> 02:19:10,547
The purpose of life.

1999
02:19:11,094 --> 02:19:13,585
You're always saying these words.

2000
02:19:15,222 --> 02:19:18,508
The words you always use
to humiliate, hurt,

2001
02:19:18,684 --> 02:19:20,926
or denigrate someone.

2002
02:19:22,897 --> 02:19:24,355
But if you ask me...

2003
02:19:24,732 --> 02:19:28,397
if someone uses these words
this much,

2004
02:19:29,486 --> 02:19:31,146
he's the one to suspect.

2005
02:19:50,216 --> 02:19:51,923
Anyway, I'm tired.

2006
02:19:53,219 --> 02:19:55,840
I'd like to sleep,
if you don't mind.

2007
02:20:12,446 --> 02:20:13,726
Necla?

2008
02:22:01,763 --> 02:22:02,843
Go on.

2009
02:23:13,585 --> 02:23:16,290
Should we check again
before we set off?

2010
02:23:17,590 --> 02:23:18,752
I called already.

2011
02:23:18,924 --> 02:23:21,593
No flights,
but the trains are running.

2012
02:23:22,302 --> 02:23:23,500
Are you sure?

2013
02:23:23,679 --> 02:23:25,636
I just called them.

2014
02:23:25,806 --> 02:23:27,882
The train is running.

2015
02:23:28,058 --> 02:23:29,682
Don't worry.

2016
02:23:31,728 --> 02:23:33,009
Fine.

2017
02:23:34,106 --> 02:23:35,766
Let's get going then.

2018
02:24:37,878 --> 02:24:39,372
Hello.

2019
02:24:41,715 --> 02:24:45,629
The Istanbul train is running,
isn't it?

2020
02:24:45,844 --> 02:24:47,801
No problem. It's on its way.

2021
02:24:47,972 --> 02:24:49,299
Any delay?

2022
02:24:49,473 --> 02:24:51,631
Of course, half an hour or an hour.

2023
02:24:51,808 --> 02:24:54,346
- Half an hour, an hour.
- That's it.

2024
02:24:54,519 --> 02:24:57,604
- But it's definitely coming, right?
- Probably.

2025
02:24:57,773 --> 02:24:59,682
OK, thank you.

2026
02:25:14,414 --> 02:25:18,163
- It's coming, but there's a delay...
- I heard him.

2027
02:25:21,338 --> 02:25:23,081
Your luggage is there.

2028
02:25:25,175 --> 02:25:27,749
I'll go back to the hotel
if you like.

2029
02:25:28,136 --> 02:25:30,343
They might need me there now.

2030
02:25:31,139 --> 02:25:33,179
- Should I go or stay?
- What?

2031
02:25:33,350 --> 02:25:35,924
They might need me at the hotel.

2032
02:25:36,102 --> 02:25:38,261
Should I go or wait here?

2033
02:25:39,565 --> 02:25:40,893
Wait.

2034
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:04,208
My friend, could you move over a bit?

2035
02:26:06,049 --> 02:26:07,425
It's cold by the door.

2036
02:26:07,593 --> 02:26:10,677
We're together.
You know, if you shift a bit.

2037
02:26:10,846 --> 02:26:12,885
There's a draft, I said. Sit here.

2038
02:27:27,965 --> 02:27:30,123
How's the road to Suavi's?

2039
02:27:30,675 --> 02:27:32,549
- Mr Suavi's farm?
- Yes.

2040
02:27:32,719 --> 02:27:34,712
It's a long way.

2041
02:27:34,889 --> 02:27:36,263
That's not my question.

2042
02:27:36,431 --> 02:27:37,974
Can the car make it?

2043
02:27:38,141 --> 02:27:40,264
No, it wouldn't.

2044
02:27:40,436 --> 02:27:43,638
The village road's impossible
in this snow.

2045
02:27:44,314 --> 02:27:46,603
Good, then we're going there.

2046
02:28:05,836 --> 02:28:08,208
Hey, what a surprise!

2047
02:28:08,380 --> 02:28:11,630
We were passing
and decided to return your visit.

2048
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:14,671
Of course. Come in.
It's warm inside.

2049
02:28:16,679 --> 02:28:18,222
Come in.

2050
02:28:18,348 --> 02:28:20,008
- Thanks.
- This way.

2051
02:28:20,183 --> 02:28:22,425
- Sit down, get warmed up.
- Thanks.

2052
02:28:22,602 --> 02:28:24,429
I was expecting Levent.

2053
02:28:24,605 --> 02:28:26,396
So I thought it was him.

2054
02:28:26,565 --> 02:28:29,685
But with Levent, you never know

2055
02:28:29,818 --> 02:28:31,360
whether he'll come.

2056
02:28:32,487 --> 02:28:35,025
We meet every Saturday afternoon.

2057
02:28:35,199 --> 02:28:36,990
To go hunting
the morning after.

2058
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:42,822
You know. Two bachelors. We lean
on each other like walking sticks.

2059
02:28:43,916 --> 02:28:46,407
Suavi, can I stretch my leg out?

2060
02:28:46,584 --> 02:28:48,493
- Go ahead.
- I got cramp.

2061
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:50,793
Put it up higher. That's it.

2062
02:28:51,882 --> 02:28:53,257
How nice.

2063
02:28:54,134 --> 02:28:55,794
Nice and warm.

2064
02:28:55,969 --> 02:28:57,463
Comfy couches.

2065
02:28:57,638 --> 02:28:59,297
You must be cold.

2066
02:28:59,639 --> 02:29:01,679
Wait, I've got just the thing.

2067
02:29:01,850 --> 02:29:05,432
One sip of this,
and the cold will disappear.

2068
02:29:06,062 --> 02:29:08,387
Let's see if you like it.

2069
02:29:10,275 --> 02:29:12,944
We take this with us
when we go hunting.

2070
02:29:13,111 --> 02:29:15,069
We put some in our flasks.

2071
02:29:16,907 --> 02:29:19,658
It's freezing cold out there.

2072
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:21,868
The teacher is young.

2073
02:29:22,412 --> 02:29:23,741
Sturdy as an ox.

2074
02:29:23,913 --> 02:29:26,583
But I need this in my engine
to keep up.

2075
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:29,704
I better not. I'm not used to it.

2076
02:29:29,878 --> 02:29:31,538
If you've some herb tea...

2077
02:29:31,713 --> 02:29:35,793
You can drink that at home.
Here, you do what I tell you.

2078
02:29:35,967 --> 02:29:38,458
Well, fine then. Thanks.

2079
02:29:39,679 --> 02:29:43,297
This is how I spoil myself.
What else is there?

2080
02:29:43,475 --> 02:29:46,144
We deserve it at our age.

2081
02:29:47,354 --> 02:29:49,062
I feel warmer now.

2082
02:29:51,608 --> 02:29:52,603
Thank you.

2083
02:29:52,776 --> 02:29:54,519
The stove is burning nicely.

2084
02:29:55,612 --> 02:29:57,901
I don't heat the whole house now.

2085
02:29:58,073 --> 02:30:00,694
After my wife died
I closed off the rooms.

2086
02:30:00,867 --> 02:30:02,326
I use them as storage.

2087
02:30:02,494 --> 02:30:04,286
And I set up this stove here.

2088
02:30:04,454 --> 02:30:07,289
It's like a shelter.
I curl up here.

2089
02:30:07,458 --> 02:30:09,366
And it helps me save a bit.

2090
02:30:11,044 --> 02:30:13,879
By the way,
what did you do about the letter?

2091
02:30:14,047 --> 02:30:15,245
What letter?

2092
02:30:15,424 --> 02:30:18,092
The one you read to Nihal and me.

2093
02:30:18,259 --> 02:30:20,965
Garip, the girl, help, and all that.

2094
02:30:22,138 --> 02:30:23,798
I didn't do anything.

2095
02:30:26,601 --> 02:30:28,559
Teacher! You made it.

2096
02:30:29,646 --> 02:30:31,520
Indeed.
Mr Aydin, nice to see you.

2097
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:33,019
Thank you, Levent.

2098
02:30:33,191 --> 02:30:35,729
- Don't get up.
- My foot's gone numb.

2099
02:30:35,902 --> 02:30:38,987
If it's only numbness,
you'll be fine.

2100
02:30:39,114 --> 02:30:39,861
Hello.

2101
02:30:40,031 --> 02:30:41,526
We had business nearby,

2102
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:42,945
so we popped in.

2103
02:30:43,117 --> 02:30:43,983
Good idea!

2104
02:30:44,161 --> 02:30:45,571
How bad are the roads?

2105
02:30:45,745 --> 02:30:48,615
Terrible. I had a hard time
getting here.

2106
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:51,245
Mr Aydin, I'll be outside
if you need me.

2107
02:30:51,418 --> 02:30:52,497
Alright.

2108
02:30:53,962 --> 02:30:56,038
- Hidayet.
- Yes, Mr Aydin.

2109
02:30:56,214 --> 02:30:57,376
Listen.

2110
02:30:58,842 --> 02:30:59,873
Sorry.

2111
02:31:03,221 --> 02:31:04,336
Listen.

2112
02:31:04,806 --> 02:31:08,091
Don't tell anyone at home I'm here.

2113
02:31:08,268 --> 02:31:10,225
Of course I won't.

2114
02:31:10,896 --> 02:31:12,723
So what should I tell them?

2115
02:31:12,897 --> 02:31:14,273
Nothing.

2116
02:31:14,441 --> 02:31:17,358
No, I mean if they call.

2117
02:31:18,528 --> 02:31:23,024
Make something up.
Nobody should know I didn't leave.

2118
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:25,441
- Alright.
- Be careful.

2119
02:31:29,581 --> 02:31:33,578
At your house, I thought,
"Finally someone worth talking to".

2120
02:31:33,752 --> 02:31:35,411
But then you disappeared.

2121
02:31:35,587 --> 02:31:38,956
Thank you. Something came up.

2122
02:31:39,966 --> 02:31:41,211
I couldn't stay.

2123
02:31:41,385 --> 02:31:42,962
Today's my lucky day.

2124
02:31:43,303 --> 02:31:45,094
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

2125
02:31:45,263 --> 02:31:47,754
Drink up,
it makes you think clearly.

2126
02:31:57,651 --> 02:32:00,402
Hi. What are you up to?

2127
02:32:04,615 --> 02:32:06,110
Now listen.

2128
02:32:07,369 --> 02:32:10,453
Don't say anything
to Mrs Nihal or anyone.

2129
02:32:10,622 --> 02:32:14,571
You know Suavi. We're at his farm.

2130
02:32:17,546 --> 02:32:18,826
He didn't go.

2131
02:32:19,965 --> 02:32:21,542
He changed his mind.

2132
02:32:23,677 --> 02:32:26,511
How should I know?
How can I ask him?

2133
02:32:28,765 --> 02:32:31,850
Stop talking nonsense.
Why would I lie to you?

2134
02:32:32,643 --> 02:32:33,972
What did you say?

2135
02:32:34,729 --> 02:32:36,437
Fatma, don't start again.

2136
02:32:36,606 --> 02:32:39,809
It's freezing. What on earth
could I be doing? Are you mad?

2137
02:32:39,985 --> 02:32:41,527
For God's sake.

2138
02:32:41,695 --> 02:32:42,893
When I was a kid,

2139
02:32:43,697 --> 02:32:46,532
I used to play in the garden here.

2140
02:32:47,617 --> 02:32:52,694
It felt life would go on like that
forever, with my mom and dad.

2141
02:32:54,082 --> 02:32:55,625
Where is all that now?

2142
02:32:56,959 --> 02:33:02,085
Sometimes I wonder what happened.
When did the house become so empty?

2143
02:33:03,174 --> 02:33:07,801
When did that mother's
little boy end up

2144
02:33:08,221 --> 02:33:11,921
a drunk, Ionely old man?

2145
02:33:13,935 --> 02:33:15,513
I got married.

2146
02:33:15,687 --> 02:33:17,146
Had a child.

2147
02:33:18,607 --> 02:33:19,934
Where are they?

2148
02:33:21,317 --> 02:33:24,484
Wife in the grave,
daughter miles away...

2149
02:33:26,948 --> 02:33:28,691
What I'm saying is,

2150
02:33:29,243 --> 02:33:32,741
since there are certain things
you can't change,

2151
02:33:33,746 --> 02:33:36,782
you have to be a bit flexible.

2152
02:33:37,542 --> 02:33:39,369
Don't judge people so much.

2153
02:33:40,670 --> 02:33:42,793
Accept things as they are.

2154
02:33:46,635 --> 02:33:48,378
Is it a bit hot in here?

2155
02:33:49,345 --> 02:33:51,422
Should we open a window?

2156
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:54,264
Of course, go ahead.

2157
02:33:57,145 --> 02:33:59,184
Should we move to that side too?

2158
02:33:59,314 --> 02:34:00,476
Alright.

2159
02:34:00,648 --> 02:34:03,649
- You go, I'll get something.
- OK.

2160
02:34:12,828 --> 02:34:15,200
It's hot and I had a drink.

2161
02:34:15,371 --> 02:34:16,996
I'm feeling a bit drowsy.

2162
02:34:17,331 --> 02:34:19,455
It would've been better not to.

2163
02:34:20,043 --> 02:34:21,502
But it's too late now.

2164
02:34:36,184 --> 02:34:38,509
So, Levent, how old are you?

2165
02:34:39,563 --> 02:34:40,642
35.

2166
02:34:40,814 --> 02:34:43,269
- Really? You don't look it.
- Well, I am.

2167
02:34:44,568 --> 02:34:45,813
Family?

2168
02:34:46,611 --> 02:34:48,983
Back in my hometown, in Yozgat.

2169
02:34:49,573 --> 02:34:51,232
My older sister and mother.

2170
02:34:52,075 --> 02:34:54,114
Ever thought of getting married?

2171
02:34:54,285 --> 02:34:55,281
Well...

2172
02:34:55,453 --> 02:34:57,861
It's fate. Didn't happen.

2173
02:34:58,039 --> 02:34:59,913
I haven't met the right one.

2174
02:35:00,709 --> 02:35:05,003
And I don't have enough money.
So I'm in no rush.

2175
02:35:05,212 --> 02:35:07,086
But in a place like this,

2176
02:35:07,591 --> 02:35:09,250
your salary would do.

2177
02:35:09,426 --> 02:35:11,465
It would, Mr Aydin.

2178
02:35:11,845 --> 02:35:15,012
But I send half to my mother.

2179
02:35:15,181 --> 02:35:17,388
She's saving up for my sister.

2180
02:35:17,517 --> 02:35:20,518
Let her get married.
She's first in line.

2181
02:35:20,645 --> 02:35:22,803
Then me. I'm in no rush.

2182
02:35:24,232 --> 02:35:26,189
How long have you been here?

2183
02:35:27,193 --> 02:35:29,518
This is my fourth year.

2184
02:35:30,614 --> 02:35:31,693
Planning to stay?

2185
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:37,404
I could leave
but you get used to a place.

2186
02:35:38,371 --> 02:35:41,705
And there are the things
we do with Mrs Nihal.

2187
02:35:41,875 --> 02:35:43,583
I want to finish them.

2188
02:35:43,752 --> 02:35:45,827
That's no problem.

2189
02:35:47,464 --> 02:35:51,046
There are always people
for that kind of thing.

2190
02:35:52,844 --> 02:35:54,920
You're right. There are.

2191
02:35:57,349 --> 02:36:00,468
I had a stammer when I was a child.

2192
02:36:00,852 --> 02:36:02,346
- Really?
- Yes.

2193
02:36:03,313 --> 02:36:06,018
I spent my entire childhood
in silence.

2194
02:36:06,399 --> 02:36:09,649
If I talk too much now, that's why.

2195
02:36:12,572 --> 02:36:14,779
So, sorry if I talk too much.

2196
02:36:15,199 --> 02:36:16,230
Warn me if I do.

2197
02:36:16,409 --> 02:36:18,900
Speak as much as you like.

2198
02:36:19,037 --> 02:36:21,444
You deserve it, my friend.

2199
02:36:22,415 --> 02:36:25,748
I prefer listening anyway.

2200
02:36:26,294 --> 02:36:27,788
Well, I warned you.

2201
02:36:28,379 --> 02:36:29,624
Roast chestnuts.

2202
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:32,297
A sin not to eat one.

2203
02:36:32,466 --> 02:36:34,424
The chestnut-man is here,
gentlemen.

2204
02:36:35,387 --> 02:36:37,794
He's brought us split chestnuts.

2205
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:54,835
Yes?

2206
02:37:56,134 --> 02:37:57,414
Hello.

2207
02:37:57,594 --> 02:37:59,586
Sorry to disturb you.

2208
02:37:59,762 --> 02:38:01,839
I'm here to see Hamdi hodja.

2209
02:38:02,015 --> 02:38:03,425
Is he in?

2210
02:38:04,476 --> 02:38:05,555
Just a minute.

2211
02:38:18,782 --> 02:38:19,980
Mrs Nihal?

2212
02:38:21,492 --> 02:38:23,615
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

2213
02:38:23,995 --> 02:38:27,280
I'm sorry. I was inside,
I couldn't... you know...

2214
02:38:27,457 --> 02:38:28,619
How can I help you?

2215
02:38:28,792 --> 02:38:32,457
I should apologize
for disturbing you so late.

2216
02:38:32,628 --> 02:38:35,630
No, not at all. Please.

2217
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,709
Is this a convenient time?

2218
02:38:38,884 --> 02:38:40,794
Sure, of course. Come in.

2219
02:38:40,970 --> 02:38:42,299
Please, come in.

2220
02:38:42,472 --> 02:38:44,511
Don't stand in the cold.

2221
02:38:44,682 --> 02:38:45,845
Thank you.

2222
02:38:47,268 --> 02:38:49,178
Come and sit by the stove.

2223
02:38:49,353 --> 02:38:50,931
Don't worry, I'm fine here.

2224
02:38:51,106 --> 02:38:53,679
It's cold there.
Come in with your shoes.

2225
02:38:53,858 --> 02:38:56,479
Thanks, I won't stay long.
I'll sit here.

2226
02:38:57,528 --> 02:38:59,071
Well then...

2227
02:39:12,210 --> 02:39:14,368
How are you? Hope nothing's wrong.

2228
02:39:14,838 --> 02:39:18,704
Don't get me wrong.
To see you here, alone...

2229
02:39:18,883 --> 02:39:23,177
I was wondering how Ilyas was.
He worried us a lot the other day.

2230
02:39:23,346 --> 02:39:26,347
Actually we heard, but I still wanted
to come for a visit.

2231
02:39:26,891 --> 02:39:29,298
Ilyas is much better now.

2232
02:39:29,477 --> 02:39:32,929
Thank God, he's fine now.
His fever dropped, too.

2233
02:39:33,105 --> 02:39:37,317
That worried us but since yesterday,
he's opened his eyes.

2234
02:39:38,027 --> 02:39:42,072
The only thing, he couldn't go
to school and he gets bored at home.

2235
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:43,948
Otherwise, he's fine.

2236
02:39:44,325 --> 02:39:45,819
It's not easy.

2237
02:39:46,660 --> 02:39:50,362
I was worried when I heard
it was pneumonia.

2238
02:39:50,915 --> 02:39:52,954
But his mother has taken
good care of him.

2239
02:39:53,125 --> 02:39:58,084
And he took his medicine
and got better. Good boy.

2240
02:39:58,714 --> 02:40:00,257
You're right.

2241
02:40:00,966 --> 02:40:02,082
Thank you.

2242
02:40:05,180 --> 02:40:06,590
Mr Aydin isn't with you?

2243
02:40:08,391 --> 02:40:09,672
No, I came alone.

2244
02:40:10,852 --> 02:40:13,308
Really? Welcome, again.

2245
02:40:15,356 --> 02:40:17,811
You must be cold,
it's freezing outside.

2246
02:40:18,025 --> 02:40:20,184
Let's have some tea. Sevda!

2247
02:40:20,653 --> 02:40:22,610
I'll go to the kitchen.

2248
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:25,615
- Don't bother.
- No, my pleasure.

2249
02:40:41,424 --> 02:40:42,622
Are you studying?

2250
02:40:46,763 --> 02:40:47,877
Huh?

2251
02:40:48,973 --> 02:40:49,969
Yes.

2252
02:40:53,644 --> 02:40:56,314
- Which subject?
- Math.

2253
02:40:57,565 --> 02:40:58,763
Do you like math?

2254
02:40:59,066 --> 02:40:59,980
Yes.

2255
02:41:00,150 --> 02:41:02,393
What will you become then?
An engineer?

2256
02:41:03,196 --> 02:41:04,358
No.

2257
02:41:05,865 --> 02:41:07,490
What then?

2258
02:41:07,658 --> 02:41:08,738
A policeman.

2259
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:10,941
Why's that?

2260
02:41:22,882 --> 02:41:24,257
Good evening, madam.

2261
02:41:24,425 --> 02:41:26,714
Good evening. And who are you?

2262
02:41:28,387 --> 02:41:31,507
Mother, Mrs Nihal
is our landlord's wife.

2263
02:41:33,934 --> 02:41:35,560
Did she bring the TV back?

2264
02:41:35,728 --> 02:41:38,729
No, mother.
That's a different matter.

2265
02:41:39,232 --> 02:41:40,263
Come, mother.

2266
02:41:41,025 --> 02:41:43,481
I want my TV back.
I watched the Imam.

2267
02:41:43,653 --> 02:41:46,191
Mrs Nihal is here for something else.

2268
02:41:46,363 --> 02:41:48,237
To wish Ilyas a speedy recovery.

2269
02:41:48,407 --> 02:41:49,570
- Sore knees?
- Aching.

2270
02:41:50,284 --> 02:41:52,692
- Let's cover them.
- No, I don't want to.

2271
02:41:52,912 --> 02:41:53,693
Alright.

2272
02:41:53,871 --> 02:41:56,493
You don't take me to the doctor.

2273
02:41:57,041 --> 02:42:00,410
Mother, you're disgracing us
in front of Mrs Nihal.

2274
02:42:00,586 --> 02:42:02,959
- You refused to go, remember?
- Too crowded.

2275
02:42:03,130 --> 02:42:06,464
They can't look after me there.
I need a private doctor.

2276
02:42:06,634 --> 02:42:08,009
But please...

2277
02:42:08,761 --> 02:42:11,216
I said to go to a private doctor too.

2278
02:42:11,389 --> 02:42:13,548
You refused to go to our Samet.

2279
02:42:13,724 --> 02:42:16,097
You remember
what his mother did to me?

2280
02:42:16,603 --> 02:42:19,271
But the son isn't the mother.

2281
02:42:19,438 --> 02:42:20,719
The doctor has to come.

2282
02:42:20,857 --> 02:42:23,430
OK then,
I'll bring the doctor right here.

2283
02:42:23,609 --> 02:42:25,816
He'll take care of my mother here.

2284
02:42:25,987 --> 02:42:28,145
Sevda, give me my prayer beads.

2285
02:42:28,322 --> 02:42:29,437
I apologize.

2286
02:42:30,116 --> 02:42:31,064
No problem.

2287
02:42:31,242 --> 02:42:34,278
When young, we're tested for our
respect and later, our compassion.

2288
02:42:34,828 --> 02:42:37,237
God bless our elders.

2289
02:42:37,414 --> 02:42:39,988
"If youngsters could know,
if elders could do."

2290
02:42:40,168 --> 02:42:43,453
I don't want to keep you longer.

2291
02:42:44,505 --> 02:42:46,248
I need to talk to you.

2292
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:48,705
Of course, please.

2293
02:42:50,845 --> 02:42:55,139
If you don't mind,
could we speak in private?

2294
02:42:56,309 --> 02:42:59,014
Of course, why not?

2295
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:03,600
We could go in there,
but it might be a bit cold.

2296
02:43:03,816 --> 02:43:06,022
Fine, it doesn't matter.

2297
02:43:06,193 --> 02:43:07,772
Let's go in. Sevda!

2298
02:43:07,945 --> 02:43:09,654
Put some wood on the stove.

2299
02:43:10,280 --> 02:43:12,108
I'll bring your tea through.

2300
02:43:13,284 --> 02:43:14,908
- Thank you.
- Please.

2301
02:43:19,790 --> 02:43:21,498
How many rooms are there?

2302
02:43:22,334 --> 02:43:24,208
There used to be two.

2303
02:43:24,378 --> 02:43:27,130
Then we added this one.

2304
02:43:27,507 --> 02:43:31,504
We got permission
from Mr Aydin's father, Mr Sami.

2305
02:43:32,345 --> 02:43:34,088
So now, we have three rooms.

2306
02:43:34,263 --> 02:43:36,220
This is my room.

2307
02:43:36,599 --> 02:43:39,054
It gets a bit colder
than the other rooms.

2308
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:43,474
But we built a fireplace
for when it gets very cold.

2309
02:43:44,106 --> 02:43:46,099
Fortunately, not this year.

2310
02:43:46,275 --> 02:43:47,556
That's right.

2311
02:43:48,862 --> 02:43:52,527
Mr Hamdi, I'd like to ask you
something, please.

2312
02:43:52,698 --> 02:43:53,978
Please do.

2313
02:43:56,035 --> 02:43:57,944
Mr Ismail, your younger brother...

2314
02:43:58,121 --> 02:44:00,907
- Older brother.
- Sorry.

2315
02:44:01,373 --> 02:44:04,078
What exactly does he do?

2316
02:44:06,129 --> 02:44:10,292
He hasn't worked for some time.
He used to work at the mine in Tozlu.

2317
02:44:10,466 --> 02:44:13,217
But unfortunately,
he got into some trouble.

2318
02:44:13,678 --> 02:44:16,216
He was in prison for six months.

2319
02:44:16,388 --> 02:44:17,799
And hasn't worked since.

2320
02:44:18,265 --> 02:44:21,765
If you don't mind me asking,

2321
02:44:21,935 --> 02:44:23,680
why was he jailed?

2322
02:44:23,854 --> 02:44:25,052
What did he do?

2323
02:44:25,231 --> 02:44:28,231
God knows, this is very embarrassing.

2324
02:44:28,526 --> 02:44:31,147
I'd rather you didn't
know us like this.

2325
02:44:32,196 --> 02:44:35,814
But I won't hide something
known to God.

2326
02:44:36,534 --> 02:44:38,610
Everyone probably knows anyway.

2327
02:44:40,329 --> 02:44:43,246
A few louts in town
were pestering his wife Sevda.

2328
02:44:43,416 --> 02:44:45,954
We only found this out later.

2329
02:44:46,418 --> 02:44:50,997
One night a loud noise woke us.
Ismail had stormed out of bed,

2330
02:44:51,215 --> 02:44:52,840
to chase someone in the street.

2331
02:44:55,761 --> 02:44:56,876
I'm ashamed to say,

2332
02:44:58,013 --> 02:45:01,133
they were stealing
Sevda's underwear off the line.

2333
02:45:01,642 --> 02:45:03,681
Ismail couldn't catch anybody.

2334
02:45:04,187 --> 02:45:06,345
But he took it out on Sevda.

2335
02:45:06,522 --> 02:45:08,847
The poor girl didn't even know.

2336
02:45:09,441 --> 02:45:12,229
Next day, in the market,

2337
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:15,489
a few of the louts laughed at Ismail.

2338
02:45:15,656 --> 02:45:18,859
Ismail pulled out a knife
and stabbed one of them.

2339
02:45:22,038 --> 02:45:25,204
That's why he served
six months in jail.

2340
02:45:27,501 --> 02:45:30,621
Well, Ismail was always wild.

2341
02:45:31,672 --> 02:45:34,293
He was never really close to anyone.

2342
02:45:35,301 --> 02:45:39,298
But when he got out, he became
even more suspicious and wild.

2343
02:45:39,472 --> 02:45:41,844
He even stopped speaking to people.

2344
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:43,759
And then they fired him.

2345
02:45:44,768 --> 02:45:48,054
He became more introverted
and started drinking.

2346
02:45:49,148 --> 02:45:50,940
He doesn't drink at home though.

2347
02:45:52,860 --> 02:45:54,936
So he's not working now.

2348
02:45:56,029 --> 02:45:59,446
We had to pay for the guy's operation
and compensation.

2349
02:46:00,117 --> 02:46:02,275
And our debts grew.

2350
02:46:02,620 --> 02:46:06,488
With only my salary,
and Ismail not working,

2351
02:46:07,083 --> 02:46:08,577
it got difficult.

2352
02:46:08,751 --> 02:46:10,494
We couldn't pay the rent.

2353
02:46:11,170 --> 02:46:14,040
Mr Aydin is right, of course.

2354
02:46:14,423 --> 02:46:17,958
We couldn't pay for a few months,
causing him problems.

2355
02:46:19,803 --> 02:46:22,128
But hopefully,
I'll find a second job.

2356
02:46:23,099 --> 02:46:24,427
I understand.

2357
02:46:25,143 --> 02:46:26,720
I hope it all works out.

2358
02:46:28,062 --> 02:46:31,477
I actually came to talk
about something related.

2359
02:46:33,400 --> 02:46:36,686
I won't take too much of your time.
It's already late.

2360
02:46:51,460 --> 02:46:53,867
Please take this and accept it.

2361
02:46:58,050 --> 02:46:59,129
What is this?

2362
02:46:59,635 --> 02:47:00,880
Open it.

2363
02:47:19,196 --> 02:47:20,821
What is this, Mrs Nihal?

2364
02:47:21,866 --> 02:47:23,774
Please don't misunderstand.

2365
02:47:24,451 --> 02:47:26,907
I want to give you this money.

2366
02:47:27,830 --> 02:47:29,407
Please take it.

2367
02:47:30,707 --> 02:47:33,744
Yes, but... I don't understand.

2368
02:47:33,919 --> 02:47:37,419
I mean, what is it for?
Why did you bring it to us?

2369
02:47:38,257 --> 02:47:39,455
Don't worry.

2370
02:47:39,633 --> 02:47:42,255
I don't want anything in return.

2371
02:47:42,427 --> 02:47:44,836
And I don't expect you
to pay it back.

2372
02:47:45,013 --> 02:47:49,924
Think of it as help from a friend,
and please accept it.

2373
02:47:51,729 --> 02:47:53,603
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs Nihal.

2374
02:47:53,772 --> 02:47:56,394
I really don't know what to say.

2375
02:47:57,109 --> 02:47:59,814
But this is a huge amount of money.

2376
02:48:01,113 --> 02:48:02,986
How can I accept this?

2377
02:48:03,491 --> 02:48:05,448
There's enough to buy a house.

2378
02:48:06,285 --> 02:48:08,906
- What would people think?
- Mr Hamdi.

2379
02:48:09,455 --> 02:48:11,578
No one needs to know.

2380
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:16,619
This can stay between you and me.

2381
02:48:28,098 --> 02:48:29,676
Welcome.

2382
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:31,012
Thank you.

2383
02:48:31,852 --> 02:48:35,138
- Sorry for disturbing you so late.
- Not at all.

2384
02:48:35,314 --> 02:48:38,232
Mrs Nihal is Mr Aydin's wife,
our landlord...

2385
02:48:38,401 --> 02:48:40,228
I know. They just told me.

2386
02:48:55,126 --> 02:48:56,324
What's up?

2387
02:48:57,794 --> 02:49:00,665
Ismail, why don't you
come and sit down?

2388
02:49:01,715 --> 02:49:03,126
Come, have a seat.

2389
02:49:12,685 --> 02:49:16,303
Mrs Nihal was worried about Ilyas.

2390
02:49:16,730 --> 02:49:19,304
She came to wish him good health.

2391
02:49:20,526 --> 02:49:21,985
That's why she came.

2392
02:49:25,573 --> 02:49:26,603
What's this?

2393
02:49:30,327 --> 02:49:33,198
Mrs Nihal brought that money
to give us.

2394
02:49:33,539 --> 02:49:34,737
Very kind of her.

2395
02:49:39,628 --> 02:49:41,087
For what reason?

2396
02:49:41,630 --> 02:49:44,750
Please don't get me wrong.
No special reason.

2397
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:48,172
I thought you might need it, and so

2398
02:49:48,345 --> 02:49:50,800
you could get your stuff back.

2399
02:49:57,313 --> 02:49:59,222
What does Mr Aydin say about it?

2400
02:49:59,940 --> 02:50:01,600
He doesn't know.

2401
02:50:02,234 --> 02:50:04,191
He doesn't need to know, either.

2402
02:50:07,406 --> 02:50:09,149
Good.

2403
02:50:19,835 --> 02:50:20,784
But all this money...

2404
02:50:23,047 --> 02:50:24,921
isn't it a bit too much?

2405
02:50:27,343 --> 02:50:29,003
On what basis?

2406
02:50:30,220 --> 02:50:33,590
What made you think of this much?

2407
02:50:33,974 --> 02:50:36,216
- Look, I didn't think anything.
- Sorry.

2408
02:50:36,393 --> 02:50:38,681
I apologize. He's surprised, too.

2409
02:50:38,854 --> 02:50:42,602
Ismael, why not go
and wash your face or something?

2410
02:50:43,901 --> 02:50:45,312
No need.

2411
02:50:46,152 --> 02:50:48,644
Then I'll get you a coffee.

2412
02:50:49,115 --> 02:50:50,739
You better have one.

2413
02:50:51,116 --> 02:50:53,785
Mrs Nihal,
let me get you another tea.

2414
02:50:54,286 --> 02:50:55,864
This one has gone cold.

2415
02:50:56,288 --> 02:50:59,574
- Don't bother.
- Please.

2416
02:51:01,751 --> 02:51:03,127
Sevda.

2417
02:51:13,431 --> 02:51:14,711
Now...

2418
02:51:19,269 --> 02:51:20,645
Let's see...

2419
02:51:22,523 --> 02:51:24,396
if the math is right.

2420
02:51:31,949 --> 02:51:34,522
Now if this amount is...

2421
02:51:36,787 --> 02:51:41,912
for little Ilyas who risked his life
to mend his father's broken pride.

2422
02:51:49,383 --> 02:51:50,925
And if this is...

2423
02:51:51,885 --> 02:51:54,091
for self-sacrificing brother Hamdi

2424
02:51:54,263 --> 02:51:58,592
who had to go hand-kissing
because he looks after 5 people.

2425
02:52:02,813 --> 02:52:04,272
And if this is

2426
02:52:05,065 --> 02:52:08,350
for the drunkard father Ismail

2427
02:52:08,945 --> 02:52:13,938
who got beaten up in front of his son
disgracing himself and his family...

2428
02:52:26,337 --> 02:52:28,128
There's still some left.

2429
02:52:30,633 --> 02:52:34,333
If that is for our heroine Mrs Nihal

2430
02:52:34,803 --> 02:52:38,587
who tries to ease her conscience
by doling out charity

2431
02:52:38,766 --> 02:52:42,466
to those less fortunate than her...

2432
02:52:44,062 --> 02:52:45,972
then this money is just enough.

2433
02:52:47,983 --> 02:52:49,774
You got the sums right.

2434
02:52:55,073 --> 02:52:57,647
A truly kind thought, but...

2435
02:52:59,619 --> 02:53:02,325
you forgot something,

2436
02:53:03,082 --> 02:53:04,540
Mrs Nihal.

2437
02:53:07,586 --> 02:53:09,412
The person in front of you

2438
02:53:10,839 --> 02:53:13,793
is a filthy drunkard
incapable of appreciating

2439
02:53:14,509 --> 02:53:16,419
all your kindness.

2440
02:54:50,939 --> 02:54:53,146
I'm now looking at these.

2441
02:54:53,650 --> 02:54:55,145
I'm looking.

2442
02:54:55,444 --> 02:54:58,563
And I'm thinking,
man, this isn't a life.

2443
02:54:58,739 --> 02:55:01,146
It's a fire scene in a stage act.

2444
02:55:01,325 --> 02:55:03,650
No fucking life, it's something else.

2445
02:55:03,827 --> 02:55:05,819
- True, very true.
- Am I wrong?

2446
02:55:05,996 --> 02:55:07,028
Right.

2447
02:55:07,205 --> 02:55:09,114
We have to stand straight.

2448
02:55:09,791 --> 02:55:12,661
We'll keep standing,
standing upright.

2449
02:55:12,836 --> 02:55:16,501
We'll say, "Come on, hit me here.
Hit me here".

2450
02:55:16,631 --> 02:55:19,301
We'll stand straight as befits a man.

2451
02:55:19,468 --> 02:55:22,469
We won't bend, cry.
Won't sob like a baby.

2452
02:55:22,637 --> 02:55:23,633
Stand upright.

2453
02:55:24,348 --> 02:55:26,506
That's what befits us, Mr Aydin.

2454
02:55:27,726 --> 02:55:30,976
There are certain moral values
and beliefs today.

2455
02:55:31,146 --> 02:55:33,186
They derived from religions,

2456
02:55:33,315 --> 02:55:38,736
which have already been rejected
by many people in the world.

2457
02:55:38,903 --> 02:55:44,243
If I reject the basis of such values,
why live a life based on them?

2458
02:55:44,410 --> 02:55:47,909
Our life would be a lie then.

2459
02:55:48,080 --> 02:55:51,698
Either support the foundation
of these values

2460
02:55:52,501 --> 02:55:55,870
or consolidate or create new ones.

2461
02:55:56,046 --> 02:55:57,422
Suavi, my brother,

2462
02:55:57,589 --> 02:55:59,878
then you'll have to create them.

2463
02:56:00,175 --> 02:56:03,757
- It's great if you can create, mate.
- But listen.

2464
02:56:05,263 --> 02:56:07,469
We want to live life to the full

2465
02:56:08,224 --> 02:56:12,353
but other people
can criticize you for that.

2466
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:16,649
You clash, you collide with them
when your paths cross.

2467
02:56:16,816 --> 02:56:22,522
But curious, innovative people with
strong personalities do it different.

2468
02:56:22,697 --> 02:56:25,651
Oddly enough,
this conflict nourishes them.

2469
02:56:25,826 --> 02:56:29,195
In a way, it stretches them.

2470
02:56:30,247 --> 02:56:32,820
Conflicts expand their minds

2471
02:56:32,999 --> 02:56:35,372
and feed their creativity.

2472
02:56:35,543 --> 02:56:37,702
Now when I look at them,

2473
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:42,007
they ignore the critics
because they have courage.

2474
02:56:42,134 --> 02:56:44,209
That's the way we should be.

2475
02:56:44,386 --> 02:56:46,793
They could come to us and say,

2476
02:56:46,972 --> 02:56:50,341
"You drink all that wine,
stuff your faces,

2477
02:56:50,475 --> 02:56:54,639
then talk about helping
the schools of the poor."

2478
02:56:54,854 --> 02:56:57,974
I say we should ignore it
and move forward.

2479
02:56:58,149 --> 02:57:00,902
For example, after the earthquake,
six years ago,

2480
02:57:01,111 --> 02:57:04,029
when you didn't open
your hotel to victims

2481
02:57:04,197 --> 02:57:07,816
but to aid organizations,

2482
02:57:07,992 --> 02:57:10,235
maybe to line your pockets...

2483
02:57:10,411 --> 02:57:13,745
I mean that's what
some people might think.

2484
02:57:13,916 --> 02:57:16,288
That's quite interesting,
what he says.

2485
02:57:16,460 --> 02:57:20,292
Or they might reproach you
for being well-heeled.

2486
02:57:20,463 --> 02:57:21,958
- They might.
- Hold on.

2487
02:57:22,132 --> 02:57:23,709
Just a minute.

2488
02:57:24,051 --> 02:57:26,339
What's that got to do with it?

2489
02:57:26,512 --> 02:57:28,089
How did you bring this up?

2490
02:57:28,263 --> 02:57:30,006
I'm giving an example.

2491
02:57:30,182 --> 02:57:33,099
Are you trying to imply something?

2492
02:57:33,227 --> 02:57:37,935
If we didn't allow victims in,
there was obviously a good reason.

2493
02:57:38,106 --> 02:57:41,890
It's easy to make unfounded
allegations, with no knowledge.

2494
02:57:42,069 --> 02:57:47,822
Hundreds of people came from abroad.
Where were they supposed to stay?

2495
02:57:48,575 --> 02:57:50,402
Where were they to stay?

2496
02:57:50,577 --> 02:57:53,780
Who was supposed to save people
under the rubble?

2497
02:57:53,955 --> 02:57:56,910
- I didn't deny that...
- Nobody thinks about that.

2498
02:57:57,083 --> 02:57:58,661
It was just an example.

2499
02:57:59,586 --> 02:58:04,414
Come on, these judgments you make
don't suit you, Mr Blent.

2500
02:58:04,591 --> 02:58:07,426
- Who's judging? I was saying...
- That's no good.

2501
02:58:07,594 --> 02:58:11,295
I maybe didn't express myself right.
I meant something else.

2502
02:58:11,472 --> 02:58:15,173
- Levent, you said it wrong.
- I didn't.

2503
02:58:16,895 --> 02:58:19,386
There is some truth in what you said,

2504
02:58:19,564 --> 02:58:21,890
but you expressed it badly.

2505
02:58:22,066 --> 02:58:25,270
I'm just saying these people exist...

2506
02:58:25,445 --> 02:58:30,901
What's your example
got to do with my case?

2507
02:58:31,076 --> 02:58:34,077
I just said
people could talk like that.

2508
02:58:34,246 --> 02:58:37,745
And another thing, hold on.

2509
02:58:37,874 --> 02:58:40,080
I'm saying the same thing.

2510
02:58:40,251 --> 02:58:45,495
There's no counting the donations
I've made over the years.

2511
02:58:45,673 --> 02:58:47,132
Great, but I'm saying...

2512
02:58:47,259 --> 02:58:49,002
Only yesterday,

2513
02:58:49,303 --> 02:58:53,087
I donated a huge sum to charity.
How about that?

2514
02:58:53,264 --> 02:58:58,057
And all these years
I have always kept my name a secret.

2515
02:58:58,228 --> 02:58:59,971
- He's right.
- Bravo.

2516
02:59:00,146 --> 02:59:02,223
I'm not criticizing.

2517
02:59:02,399 --> 02:59:04,890
He just couldn't express himself.

2518
02:59:05,068 --> 02:59:06,230
But I still can't get rid of

2519
02:59:06,986 --> 02:59:10,651
the sarcasm and snide remarks.

2520
02:59:11,199 --> 02:59:13,820
Is it fair,
just because we've got money?

2521
02:59:13,994 --> 02:59:17,493
All I'm saying is
there are people like that.

2522
02:59:17,664 --> 02:59:19,538
They exist. God damn them.

2523
02:59:19,708 --> 02:59:21,535
I'd say God damn them too, but...

2524
02:59:21,668 --> 02:59:28,585
judging like that is unacceptable
before understanding all this.

2525
02:59:28,758 --> 02:59:30,798
I failed to express myself.

2526
02:59:30,969 --> 02:59:34,468
I call for some morality,
some conscience, please.

2527
02:59:35,307 --> 02:59:38,261
Speak up, son.
Tell him you put it wrong.

2528
02:59:39,144 --> 02:59:41,848
What's that got to do with it?
It's irrelevant.

2529
02:59:42,022 --> 02:59:43,516
It's not what he meant.

2530
02:59:43,690 --> 02:59:48,850
I don't see what it's got to do
with morality and conscience.

2531
02:59:49,029 --> 02:59:53,323
No, I can't accept such a judgment.

2532
02:59:53,492 --> 02:59:55,283
Implicating him is a problem.

2533
02:59:55,451 --> 02:59:58,323
Look, I've been silent for 15 years.

2534
02:59:58,497 --> 03:00:02,873
My words come out before my thoughts.
If I had shut up...

2535
03:00:03,042 --> 03:00:07,752
Is it fair to accuse me
just because we have a few bucks?

2536
03:00:07,922 --> 03:00:11,339
Did I create this world?
That's how the system is.

2537
03:00:11,510 --> 03:00:14,296
This is how God created it.

2538
03:00:14,554 --> 03:00:15,835
What can I do about it?

2539
03:00:16,014 --> 03:00:18,303
Justice doesn't even exist in nature.

2540
03:00:18,474 --> 03:00:20,514
So why should it exist here?

2541
03:00:20,685 --> 03:00:23,971
- Their talk is wrong.
- Are we meant to feel guilty?

2542
03:00:24,147 --> 03:00:27,314
I'm saying the same thing but...

2543
03:00:27,484 --> 03:00:31,149
you jumped on
morality and conscience.

2544
03:00:31,321 --> 03:00:34,322
- I failed to express myself.
- He couldn't.

2545
03:00:35,158 --> 03:00:38,325
Couldn't express himself properly.
You got carried away, son.

2546
03:00:39,204 --> 03:00:40,746
You actually said nice things too.

2547
03:00:40,913 --> 03:00:43,535
Everything has a logic.

2548
03:00:43,750 --> 03:00:45,743
- He's right.
- Just like that.

2549
03:00:45,918 --> 03:00:47,627
Whatever.

2550
03:00:50,048 --> 03:00:51,756
We wined and dined.

2551
03:00:52,634 --> 03:00:54,757
Let me get up, brother.

2552
03:00:55,219 --> 03:00:57,177
I haven't slept for two days.

2553
03:00:57,347 --> 03:01:00,597
OK. I'll give you a blanket.
Come along.

2554
03:01:00,726 --> 03:01:02,967
You do that.

2555
03:01:03,812 --> 03:01:09,054
This drunkard must now shut up
or he'll keep rattling like a tin.

2556
03:01:09,276 --> 03:01:11,434
I wasn't going to talk though.

2557
03:01:12,195 --> 03:01:14,188
But before I leave...

2558
03:01:15,032 --> 03:01:17,570
this is your field, Mr Aydin...

2559
03:01:17,742 --> 03:01:18,940
Not at all.

2560
03:01:19,119 --> 03:01:22,784
I would like to quote Shakespeare,
by way of a conclusion.

2561
03:01:29,296 --> 03:01:30,754
"Conscience

2562
03:01:31,381 --> 03:01:34,417
is but a word that cowards use

2563
03:01:35,510 --> 03:01:40,338
devised at first
to keep the strong in awe.

2564
03:01:53,028 --> 03:01:56,396
Our strong arms be our conscience,

2565
03:01:56,573 --> 03:01:59,028
swords our law."

2566
03:02:02,662 --> 03:02:03,860
Good night.

2567
03:02:06,374 --> 03:02:07,999
Hold on, hold on.

2568
03:02:08,167 --> 03:02:13,921
Allow me to contribute
the following lines to this meeting.

2569
03:02:14,758 --> 03:02:16,335
As a reply.

2570
03:02:21,180 --> 03:02:22,591
Our infallible fate

2571
03:02:22,766 --> 03:02:25,933
is to be deceived
in everything we attempt.

2572
03:02:28,271 --> 03:02:32,600
I make brilliant plans
each morning...

2573
03:02:35,278 --> 03:02:37,236
and fool about all day.

2574
03:02:46,038 --> 03:02:47,497
There you go.

2575
03:02:50,961 --> 03:02:53,416
You've pulled your trick again.

2576
03:03:04,265 --> 03:03:05,808
Are you alright?

2577
03:03:06,351 --> 03:03:08,225
Let it out, relax.

2578
03:03:09,479 --> 03:03:11,056
- Let it go.
- So sorry.

2579
03:03:11,272 --> 03:03:13,810
- Go on, let it all out.
- Oh my.

2580
03:03:13,984 --> 03:03:17,104
Sorry, I've made a real mess.

2581
03:03:17,278 --> 03:03:20,030
No problem.
Leave it, come on.

2582
03:03:20,198 --> 03:03:22,237
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go out.

2583
03:03:22,408 --> 03:03:27,200
Plenty of fine fresh air outside.
And snow. You'll be fine.

2584
03:03:27,372 --> 03:03:30,706
Come on, my friend, come with me.

2585
03:03:31,293 --> 03:03:33,997
Easy. Don't force yourself.

2586
03:03:34,212 --> 03:03:35,623
Come on.

2587
03:03:36,339 --> 03:03:39,044
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

2588
03:03:39,217 --> 03:03:41,672
I'll lay you down here. Come on.

2589
03:03:48,894 --> 03:03:51,349
Let's walk over there,
then we're done.

2590
03:03:57,944 --> 03:04:00,614
He must be light, he's not sinking.

2611
03:07:20,187 --> 03:07:21,938
- Hidayet, stop.
- What for?

2612
03:07:22,148 --> 03:07:23,523
Pull over.

2613
03:07:24,150 --> 03:07:26,276
I'm afraid
it won't start up again.

2614
03:07:26,485 --> 03:07:27,944
- Back up a little.
- What?

2615
03:07:28,154 --> 03:07:29,613
Put it in reverse.

2616
03:07:48,883 --> 03:07:49,841
Stop.

2617
03:08:13,908 --> 03:08:15,158
Mr. Aydin?

2618
03:08:17,244 --> 03:08:20,080
Nothing, that's good, let's go.

2619
03:09:15,219 --> 03:09:16,344
Fatma!

2620
03:10:03,267 --> 03:10:04,309
Nihal ...

2621
03:10:05,144 --> 03:10:06,561
I haven't left.

2622
03:10:07,438 --> 03:10:09,105
I haven't been able to.

2623
03:10:11,734 --> 03:10:15,612
Could I have become old or crazy,

2624
03:10:16,363 --> 03:10:19,199
or a different man?

2625
03:10:19,408 --> 03:10:21,284
It doesn't matter what you think.

2626
03:10:22,453 --> 03:10:23,536
I do not know.

2627
03:10:30,336 --> 03:10:34,547
But this new man in me holds me back.

2628
03:10:36,050 --> 03:10:38,343
Don't blame me.

2629
03:10:45,309 --> 03:10:48,770
I know now
nothing's in Istanbul.

2630
03:10:50,564 --> 03:10:52,816
Everything is strange to me,

2631
03:10:53,025 --> 03:10:55,235
there as elsewhere.

2632
03:11:00,533 --> 03:11:04,160
Know that I have no one else
but you.

2633
03:11:07,248 --> 03:11:10,917
I miss you every minute,
at every moment.

2634
03:11:13,379 --> 03:11:16,923
I would never tell you,
my pride prevents me.

2635
03:11:19,593 --> 03:11:22,637
I know it would be terrible,

2636
03:11:23,097 --> 03:11:25,890
if not impossible for me
to leave you.

2637
03:11:27,852 --> 03:11:30,937
Just as I know
than you don't love me anymore.

2638
03:11:38,612 --> 03:11:41,030
I know our past
will not return.

2639
03:11:42,867 --> 03:11:44,742
I do not regret it.

2640
03:11:53,878 --> 03:11:55,879
Take me as a servant,

2641
03:11:58,757 --> 03:12:00,675
as a slave.

2642
03:12:12,730 --> 03:12:14,522
Continue our life together,

2643
03:12:15,983 --> 03:12:19,569
even in your own way.

2644
03:12:29,538 --> 03:12:31,039
Forgive me.

2645
03:13:03,572 --> 03:13:06,908
