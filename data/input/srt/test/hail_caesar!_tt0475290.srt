But I'm sure you
appreciate also

242
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,359
that great masses
of humanity

243

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,472
A story told before, yes,

250
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,755
but we like to
flatter ourselves

251
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,875
that it's never been told

252
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,917
with this kind of
distinction and panache.

253
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,390
Perhaps, sir, you forget its
telling in the Holy Bible.

254
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,028
Quite right, Patriarch.
The Bible, of course, is terrific.

255
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,712
But for
millions of people,

256
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,758
pictures will be their
reference point for the story.

the story's, uh...

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,311
You "realize," of course,
that for we Jews,

260
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,234
any visual depiction of the Godhead
is most strictly prohibited.

261

Oh.

262
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,756
But, of course, for us, the man
Jesus Nazarene is not God.

Wonderful young actor we found in Akron,
Ohio, in a nationwide talent hunt.

268
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,551
But Hocheiser is
seen only fleetingly

269
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,198
and with extreme taste.

270
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,511
Our story is told through the
eyes of a Roman tribune.

271
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,750
Autolochus Antoninus.

272
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,269
Ordinary man,
skeptical at first,

273
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,112
but who comes to
a grudging respect

274
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,952
for this swell
figure from the East.

275
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,635
And Autolochus
is played by

276
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,952
Baird Whitlock.

277
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Oh, my.

278
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,434
Well, he is certainly
a great talent.

279
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,240
Now, Hail, Caesar!
Is a prestige picture,

280
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,799
our biggest
release of the year,

281
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,235
and we're devoting huge
resources to its production

282
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,594
in order to
make it first-class

283
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,715
in every respect.

284
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,189
Gentlemen, given
its enormous expense,

285
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,311
we don't wanna send it to
market except in the certainty

286
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,914
that it will not offend
any reasonable American

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,389
regardless of faith or creed.

288
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,789
Now that's where you come in.
You've read the script.

289
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,960
I wanna know if the theological
elements of the story

290
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
are up to snuff.

291
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,310
I thought the
chariot scene was fakey.

292
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
How is he going to jump from
one chariot to the other

293
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,312
going full speed?

294
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Uh-huh.

295
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,796
Well, we can look at that.

296
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,913
But as for the
religious aspect,

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,594
does the depiction of Christ
Jesus cut the mustard?

298
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,151
Well, the nature of Christ
is not quite as simple

299
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,719
as your photoplay
would have it.

300
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,915
How so, Father?

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,231
It's not the case simply
that Christ is God, or God Christ.

302
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,509
You can say
that again.

303
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,033
The Nazarene
was not God.

304
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,349
He was not not-God.

305
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,600
RABBI: He was a man.
Part God.

306
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,749
RABBI: No, sir.

307
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,831
But, Rabbi, all of us have a
little bit of God in us, don't we?

308
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Well...

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,752
It's the foundation
of our belief

310
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,674
that Christ is most properly
referred to as the Son of God.

311
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,515
It's the Son of God who takes the
sins of the world upon himself

312
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,955
so that the rest of God's children,
we imperfect beings,

313
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,430
through faith, may enter
the Kingdom of heaven.

314
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,188
So God is split?
CATHOLIC CLERGYMAN: Yes.

315
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,029
And no.

316
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,678
EASTERN ORTHODOX CLERGYMAN:
There is unity in division.

317
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,113
And division
in unity.

318
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,554
I'm not sure
I follow, Padre.

319
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
Young man, you don't follow
for a very simple reason.

320
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,109
These men
are screwballs.

321
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,271
RABBI: God has children?
What, and a dog?

322
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,028
A collie, maybe?

323
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,314
God doesn't
have children.

324
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,118
He's a bachelor.
And very angry.

325
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,320
No, no, he used
to be angry.

326
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
What?
He got over it?

327
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,920
You worship the God
of another age.

328
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,229
Who has no love.

329
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,879
Not true.
He likes Jews.

330
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,149
God loves everyone.

331
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,355
God is love!

332
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,195
God is who he is.

333
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,032
This is special?
Who isn't who is?

334
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,078
But how should God be
rendered in a motion picture?

335
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,559
God isn't in the
motion picture!

336
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,073
Then who is
Todd Hocheiser?

337
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,754
Gentlemen, maybe we're biting off
more than we can chew.

338
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,150
We don't need to agree on
the nature of the deity here,

339
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,995
if we could focus on the Christ,
whatever his parentage.

340
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,391
My question is,
is our depiction fair?

341
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,794
I have seen worse.

offend a reasonable man.

tastefulness and class.

all of a sudden?

348
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,112

you think, Rabbi?

349
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Eh...

350
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,437
I haven't
an opinion.

351
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,393
How did we do?
I don't...

352
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,959
Fine. What's up?

Can't find
Baird Whitlock.

354
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,235
He left the set
over an hour ago,

355
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,958
said he was going
to his dressing room,

356
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,189
but he isn't there.

357
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,350
Out on a bender? Middle of the day?
Am I crazy?

358
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,192
You're not crazy,
but, no.

359
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,716
I checked the Til Two, Dan Tana's,
Rusty Scupper. No soap.

360
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,279
Home, maybe? Called his wife?
Yep.

361
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
What did Laura say?

362
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,800
"He's not home,
he's never home.

363
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,233
"He's a louse.
Try one of his chippies."

364
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,753
Called that script girl,
what's her name, Francie?

365
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,875
Uh, check.

366
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,995
Any of the gals
missing from the set?

367
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Nope.

368

We won't worry yet.

STUDIO ASSISTANT: Hobie?

370
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,031

you're finished here,

Okay.

to your premiere tonight.

377

How come?
I don't know her.

I ain't doing that again.
I had two marriages.

401
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,315
It just cost the studio a lot
of money to bust them up.

402
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,674
Well, we had to
have those annulled.

One was to
a minor mob figure...

404
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,798
Vince was not minor.

405
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,949
And Buddy Flynn
was a bandleader

with a long history
of narcotic use.

407

Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
They were both louses.

408
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,916
Marrying a third louse
ain't gonna do me no good.

What, you think if there
wasn't a good, reliable man,

412
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,360
I wouldn't have
grabbed him?

413
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,556
What about Arne Seslum?
He is the father, isn't he?

414
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,909
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,877
The marriage doesn't
have to last forever.

416
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,837
But, DeeAnna,
having a child without a father

417
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,200
would present a public-relations
problem for the studio.

418
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,310
The aquatic pictures
do very nicely for us.

419
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,519
So you go and strap on a
fish-ass and marry Arne Seslum.

420

The pictures do well
for all of us,

and it's a tribute to you.

The public loves you because
they know how innocent you are.

That's true.

424
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,679
Let me see if Arne
is open to matrimony.

425
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,880
You're sure he's the father?

426
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,639
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely,
he's the father, yes!

427
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,069
Pretty sure.

here is our set.

And, in fact, that's right, yes,
you enter from there,

447
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,995
having just seen
Biff's valise in the foyer,

Indeed you have.

Sure.
Let's try...

Let's see, first of all,
why don't we

dispense with
the mirthless chuckle?

507

No mirthless chuckle.

00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,672
No, no need, really. It was a bad idea.
It was bad directorial.

maybe try her
one more time.

I sure wanna give her to you.

Man's institutions
are split,

00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,155
expressing contradictions
that must be worked through.

00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,237
And they are worked through in
a causative, predictable way.

You see, if you
understand economics,

you can actually write down
what will happen in the future.

With as much confidence as you write
down the history of the past.

It's not make believe.

Uh, Mr. Smitrovich takes

Your studio, for instance,
is a pure instrument of capitalism.

810
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,875
As such, it expresses the
contradictions of capitalism

811
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,717
and can be enlisted to
finance its own destruction.

First of all, there's
nothing to that story.

I've heard it,
it's been around forever,

been confirmed.

And secondly,
you can't print that.

Even if you could print it,
you couldn't print it.

Trade the story of my career for
a puff piece on Hobie Doyle?

disappeared from the set today.

have to take a break.

she was, that cow!

SAILOR 2: (SINGING)
Out there on the sea

1104
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,114
Here's how it will be

1105
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,673
I'm gonna
dance with you, pal

1106
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,228
You're gonna dance with me

ALL: When we're out
there on the sea

1108
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,798
We'll be happy as can be

1109
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,599
Or so the captain claims

1110
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,672
But we have to disagree
'Cause the only guarantee

1111
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,798
Is I'll see a lot of you
And you'll see a lot of me

1112
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,829
ALL: And it's absolutely certain
that we'll see a lot of sea

gonna see no dames

We're gonna see
And how will it be?

We ain't gonna see no...

Okay.

Come here, Burt Gurney.
We go again.

1133
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,993
Anything different,
Mr. Seslum?

1134

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, no.

1135

Mostly pretty good,
but this time

don't put dishrag

You are the star.

I don't mind if he wants to...

nose in other people's business,

but, uh...

1147
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,108
Well, I understand you've been
associating with DeeAnna Moran?

Yeah, yeah,
we associated.

Yes.

But no more, no more.
Don't you worry, Eddie Mannix.

But, Arne, you are
aware that she's...

This must not be in movie magazines,
that we are associated.

No, no,
of course not.

And a third on the way, apparently.
Mmm-hmm.

Do you enjoy physical culture,
Eddie Mannix? Do you ski?

1163
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,356
No. I never took it up.
Seems like a lot of fun, Arne.

1164

I no more associate
with DeeAnna Moran.

So, I feel somebody poking at me,
and I wake up and it's Clark.

1169

And he says, "Well, your keys aren't
in there, so I guess we're walking."

Yeah, we used to go up to
San Berdoo every weekend.

00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,276
Bob Stack would
come up sometimes.

was still open.

1175

Dave Chasen
was a busboy.

1176
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,716
Quite a place.
Yours?

1177
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,309
Gracious, no. It belongs to
a member of our study group.

00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,392
He couldn't be
here this afternoon.

have missed you.

"Baird, you gotta stop doing this."

1186

But you're saying, actually,
technically, I was kidnapped.

1187
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,036
Well, technically, yes.

1188
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,549
There's gonna be a ransom?

1189
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,159
I'd hardly
call it a ransom.

1190

Benedict there.
That's Benedict de Bonaventure.

1191

He wrote
The House of Ahasuaris.

1192
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,675
Enormous hit. Made the
studio millions of dollars.

1193

Did you see any of those
millions of dollars, Ben?

All successful. You see any of
the profits, Dutch? (SCOFFS)

1199
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,591
See, all of us
here are writers.

1200
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,432
The pictures originated with us.
They're our ideas.

1201
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,079
But they're owned
by the studio.

1202
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,872
I'm not saying only writers
are being exploited.

1203
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,200
I mean, look at
yourself, Baird.

1204
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,431
The studio takes
pretty good care of me.

1205
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,868
What are you, a child?

1206
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,189
I think what Herschel's
trying to say is,

1207
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,318
just because the studio owns
the means of production,

1208
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,157
why should it be able to
take the money, our money,

1209
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,151
the value created
by our labor,

1210
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,555
and dole out
what it pleases?

1211
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,789
That's not right.

1212
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,157
So, no. No.
I wouldn't call it ransom.

1213
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,878
Payback.
WRITER 1: That's right.

1214
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,551
Now, until quite recently our
study group had a narrow focus.

1215
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,395
We concentrated on getting communist
content into motion pictures.

1216
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,676
Always in a sub
rosa way, of course.

1217
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,235
And we were
pretty darn successful.

1218
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,516
You remember in
Kerner's Corner

1219
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,755
the town hall scene
where the alderman

1220
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,114
overturned the
rotten election

1221
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,918
and made Gus the mayor?

1222
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,829
Yeah.

1223
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,515
Well, I like to think
we've changed a few minds.

1224
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,036
But then Dr. Marcuse came down from
Stanford, joined the study group

1225
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,159
and started teaching
us about direct action.

1226
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,918
Praxis.
Action.

1227
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,551
We each pursue our
own economic interest.

1228
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,317
We ourselves are not above
the laws of history.

1229
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,038
But in pursuing our
interests with vigor,

1230
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,431
we accelerate the dialectic

1231
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,036
and hasten the end of history and
the creation of the New Man.

1232
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,391
Plus, we make a little dough.
DUTCH: Shut up!

1233
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,392
We're not even
talking about money!

1234
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,198
We're talking about economics.

1235
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,472
Sure, good.

1236
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,078
Good stuff.

1237
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,832
So, now, uh, do I get
a share of the ransom?

1238
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,109
No.
(ALL LAUGHING)

1239
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,637
No, Mr. Whitlock, you can hardly
share in your own ransom.

1240
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,153
That would be unethical.

1241
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,231
I don't know. That doesn't
seem fair, fellas.

1242
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,633
I mean, the whole setup only
works if I play along, right?

1243
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,719
If I don't let on that I
know who kidnapped me.

1244
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,199
Well, yes,
that's right.

1245
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,239
What if I name names?

1246
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,071
If I just tell the truth.

1247
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,920
Uh...

1248
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,392
I don't think you'll
do that, Mr. Whitlock.

1249
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:14,438
What if we told the truth
about On Wings as Eagles?

1250
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,553
EDDIE: Sid.

1251
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,840
We have to work something
out for DeeAnna Moran.

1252
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,429
She get married again?

1253
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,988
No, that's the problem.
Having a child, not married.

1254
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,189
Whew. Tough.

1255
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,349
Yeah, no father.

1256
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,960
Well, of course
there is one somewhere.

1257
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,554
But who knows?
Exactly.

1258
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,755
So is there any way...

1259
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,439
I'm just spitballing here.

1260
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,718
Any way she could
adopt her own child?

1261
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,597
Interesting.
As a single... Mmm-hmm.

1262
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,110
She disappears for a while, reappears.
Uh-huh.

1263
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,316
She wants to share her
blessings, adopt a child.

1264
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,313
Sure. She's always
yearned to be a mother.

1265
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,869
That's it.

1266
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,558
Well, I don't see
why not.

1267
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,629
Nothing in the
California statute

1268
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,636
prohibits adoption by one's own parent.
Mmm-hmm.

1269
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,714
This is new ground.

1270
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,392
Technically, she'd have
to give up the baby

1271
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,038
to a third party.

1272
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,314
Joe Silverman.

1273
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,034
Joe Silverman. Exactly.

1274
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,799
He's the foster father
for a few days.

1275
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,553
She hands the kid to Joe,
he hands it back.

1276
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,029
I'll do
some research.

1277
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,120

directors, and one of them said

1281
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,195
that an extra in the courtyard of
Sestimus Amydias seemed jumpy.

1282
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,633
All right. Get Walt
the name of the extra

1283
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,160
so he can bring
him in and sweat him.

1284
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,593
Walt should tell him that
we won't press charges

1285
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,635
if he tells us where
Baird's been taken.

1286
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,755
NATALIE: Check.

1287
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,831
And if he plays dumb,
or the AD's wrong and he is dumb,

1288
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,148
check the other extras.

1289
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,832
Check. Thessaly Thacker called,
(SIGHS)

1290
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,150
said you promised her an
interview with Baird today.

1291
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,078
Check that. It was
Thora Thacker.

1292
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,309
No, it's Thessaly.

1293
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,913
Tell her he was at the
doctor longer than expected,

1294
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,797
and she can see him on the set
bright and early tomorrow.

1295
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,996
Check. And is that
last part true?

Let's hope so.
Oh, that reminds me.

1413
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,720
A few things
to take care of.

1414
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,159
Gee, another late night.
Hmm.

1415
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,998
You know, Lockheed
improved their offer.

1416
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,560
Darned good money,

1417
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,955
and the hours wouldn't be
crazy like this either.

1418
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,872
It's nice
to be wanted.

1419
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,949
Yeah. Sure, but...

1420
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,551

1422
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,277
I like the shorter hours.

But what do you think, honey?
You know best.

1424
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,800
Hmm.

How's it going with
the smoking, dear?

NARRATOR: The denizens of Los Angeles
make ready for nightlife, or for sleep.

1428

But Eddie Mannix
will have neither.

1429
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,075
Even in westerly Malibu,
the sun has moved on,

1430
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,912
leaving the vast
and tireless sea

1431
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,515
to heave itself
blindly upon the shore.

1432
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,919
The communists welcome
a rare moment of leisure.

Baird Whitlock has
become their acolyte,

1435
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,357
a convert to their cause,

1436
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,193
his belief compelled
but not grudging.

1437
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,115
He now seeks to learn more
from Professor Marcuse

1438
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,031
and becomes
ever more committed

1439
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,588
to the quest to hasten
an end to history

1440
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,517
and bring on the New Man.

1441
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,438
Herb, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1442
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,511
That's what happened to me when
I went to Reno with Danny Kaye,

1443
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,278
and he asked me
to shave his back.

1444
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,634
The exact same thing.

1445
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,358
Because I'm thinking,
"Who benefits?"

1446
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,910
Also, I gotta tell ya, everybody
thinks that Danny is a jerk.

1447
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,479
He's not really a jerk.

1448
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,837
It's just the theory generating
its own anti-theory.

1449
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,792
Anyway, there we were,
it's me and Danny,

1450
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,279
and I'm wondering
what the hell am I doing

1451
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,554
with a razor
in my hand.

1452
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,990
And he says it's for
a Norman Taurog picture.

1453
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,429
But Judy Canova is there,
and she knows Norman.

1454
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,600
She says, "Danny's not doing
a Norman Taurog picture.

1455
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,836
"He just wants you
to shave his back!"

1456
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,639
And that's who benefits.

you saw me take

that pie off the sill,
Ms. McGraw.

Not your fault? Whose
fault was it, Curly?

Why, that crazy,
lazy full moon!

Don't know
about this part.

one shot at the song.

1475

I wish there
never was no moon.

I wish there weren't
no bossy old women!

Don't blame that moon, Curly.

for Eddie Mannix.

getting started.

we had the vehicle title
transferred to Joe's name,

in LA County lockup.

01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,160
Eddie, I wouldn't...
I would never do that!

1725
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,235
Shut up!

1726
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,436
You're gonna go out there and
you're gonna finish Hail, Caesar!

1727
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:09,515
You're gonna
give that speech

1728
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,589
at the feet of the
penitent thief,

1729
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,432
and you're gonna believe
every word you say.

1730
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:13,720
(GRUNTING)

1731
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,115
You're gonna do it
because you're an actor

1732
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,275
and that's what you do,

1733
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,998
just like the director
does what he does,

1734
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,069
and the writer
and the script girl

1735
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,440
and the guy who
claps the slate.

1736
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,400
You're gonna do it because
the picture has worth!

1737
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,152
And you have worth if
you serve the picture,

1738
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,196
and you're never gonna
forget that again.

1739
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:27,360
(MUMBLING)

1740
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,479
I won't forget, Eddie.

1741
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,071
You're damn right
you won't.

1742
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,276
Not as long as
I run this dump.

(DOOR OPENS)
Baird.

1744
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,751
Go out there
and be a star.

NATALIE: Mr. Mannix!

1746
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,475
Since you're
going to your car,

1747
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,993
I thought you might
wanna take this.

1748
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,195
What is it?

1749
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,639
From DeeAnna Moran.

1750
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,199
Thank you, and she
doesn't need to

1751
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,998
adopt her baby
after all.

1752
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,115
Huh?

1753
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,510
She asked Joe Silverman out
for dinner last night,

1754
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,033
and I guess
it went well.

1755
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,269
They drove to
Palm Springs

1756
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,510
and were married at
3:00 this morning.

Huh.
(SIGHS)

01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,191
Will you be gone long?
Today's call list to go through.

1759
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,510
No, less than an hour.
Personal errand.

1760
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,113
It's a nice arrangement.

1761
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,838
She charged it
to the studio.

1762
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,513
Right. (GASPS)

1763
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,155
Just coming to see you.

1764
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,429
Good morning. Uh...

1765
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,440
Sorry about last night, Thora.
I didn't know your sister would show up.

1766
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,394
Well, that's as may be, but I
certainly learned my lesson.

1767
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,557
Whatever you say today,
Eddie Mannix,

1768
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,119
my column tomorrow
is about

1769
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:36,111
On Wings as Eagles.

1770
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,673
Thora, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

1771
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,989
I'm sure you wouldn't.

1772
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,754
No, no, no, you don't understand.
Let's sit down.

1773
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,958
I'm telling you not to run the column,
Thora, for your own good.

1774
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,195
(LAUGHS)

1775
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,554
I can judge
my own interest.

1776
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,471
This will be
the story of the year.

1777
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,232
And it so happens
the Hearst syndicate

1778
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,311
are looking to pick up
a Hollywood column.

1779
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,515
And you think this
will cinch it for you?

1780
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,600
You know it will.

1781
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,759
Baird Whitlock,
your biggest star,

1782
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,519
got his first major part
in On Wings as Eagles

1783
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,238
by engaging in sodomy

1784
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,273
with the picture's director,
Laurence Laurentz.

1785
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,918
Oh, we've all
heard the story.

1786
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,991
But here's something
you haven't heard.

1787
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,435
Your source
is a communist.

1788
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,428
If you print it,
it'll be dismissed

1789
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,555
as a commie smear tactic,

1790
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,109
and you'll be dismissed
as a commie stooge.

1791
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,912
Burt Gurney has
left the country.

1792
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,594
The cell he was part of has
been smashed by the police.

1793
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,269
Might have thought
he was credible

1794
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,828
because he's Mr. Laurentz's
current protégé,

1795
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:32,032
but you don't want to be seen as
Burt Gurney's mouthpiece after this.

1796
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,150
How did you know
Burt was my source?

1797
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,673
Late last night,
I talked to Laurence,

1798
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,557
put two and two together.

1799
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,314
Well, no reason to send this
since I ran into you.

1800
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,200
It's my way of apology for
Thessaly horning in last night.

1801
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,157
I do value
our friendship, Thora,

1802
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,151
but I'm late for
something important.

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

1806
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:13,353
Why on your knees before
this Hebrew, Autolochus?

1807
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,080
I encountered him
before, Gracchus.

1808
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,549
Beside the well
of Jehosaphat.

1809
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,557
And what manner of man.

1810
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,432
He's a priest of
the Israelites,

1811
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,511
despised even by
the other priests.

1812
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,869
No.

1813
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,351
On yesterday's march,

1814
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,075
punished by the
dust of the road,

1815
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,276
I sought to drink
first at the well,

1816
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,993
before the slaves
in my charge,

1817
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,753
whose thirst was far
greater than my own.

1818
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,070
A Roman drinks
before a slave.

1819
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,077
This man was
giving water to all.

1820
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,273
He saw no Roman,
he saw no slave.

1821
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,797
He saw only men, weak men,
and gave succor.

1822
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,276
He saw suffering,
which he sought to ease.

1823
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,715
He saw sin,
and gave love.

1824
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,117
Love, Autolochus?

1825
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,514
He saw my own sin,
Gracchus, and greed.

1826
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,112
But in his eyes, I saw
no shadow of reproach.

1827
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,077
I saw only light.

1828
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,638
The light of God.

1829
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,469
You mean,
of the gods.

1830
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:21,197
I do not, friend Gracchus.

1831
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,840
This Hebrew is
a son of the one God.

1832
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,468
The God of this
far-flung tribe.

1833
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:30,157
And why shouldn't
God's anointed appear here

1834
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,751
among these strange people,
to shoulder their sins?

1835
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:39,554
Here, Gracchus,
in this sun-drenched land.

1836
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,468
Why should He
not take this form,

1837
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,951
the form of
an ordinary man?

1838
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,315
A man bringing us
not the old truths,

1839
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,799
but a new one.

1840
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,993
A new truth?

the truth that we can see.

A truth beyond this world.

but in light.

Yes, my son.

May I ask you
something, Father?

Like, an easy job.

1880
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:52,233
No, it's not a bad job.
It's not bad.

1881
01:37:55,280 --> 01:38:00,229
But, then, there's this other
job that's not so easy.

1882
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,119
No, in fact, it's hard.

1883
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,633
It's so hard, Father...

1884
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,473
Sometimes I don't know
if I can keep doing it,

1885
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,471
but it seems right.

1886
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,951
I don't know
how to explain.

1887
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,633
God wants us to
do what's right.

1888
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,354
Yeah.

1889
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,638
Yeah, of course
He does.

1890
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,718
The inner voice that
tells you what's right,

1891
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,474
it comes from God,
my son.

1892
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,795
Yeah, I got it.

1893
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,313
That's His way
of saying that...

1894
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,993
Yeah, yeah,
I got it.

1895
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,673
NATALIE: Still raining
in Gallup, New Mexico.

1896
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,114
And the Tucumcari crew
has shot all the plates

1897
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,474
we need for
Came the Rain.

1898
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,240
Well, just shoot the showdown in
the weather and we'll retitle it.

1899
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,716
Tucumcari Tempest,
Desert Squall, Hold Back The Storm.

1900
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,235
NARRATOR: The stories begin,
the stories end.

1901
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:56,674
I don't know,
bounce it off the writers.

1902
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,840
NARRATOR: So it has been.

1903
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:58,915
Here's today's
call list.

1904
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,514
Add a call to a Mr. Cuddahy
at the Lockheed Corporation.

1905
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,033
Long call?
Short?

1906
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,077
"Thanks, but no thanks."
How long was that?

1907
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,434
NARRATOR: But the story
of Eddie Mannix...

1908
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,748
Who do we
call first?

1909
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,193
...will never end.

1910
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,429
New York first.

1911
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:11,800
Time to check in
with Mr. Schenk.

1912
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,869
NARRATOR: For his is a tale
written in light everlasting.

1913
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,634
