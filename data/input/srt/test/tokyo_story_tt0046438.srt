We'll pass Osaka
at about 6:00 tonight.

21
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:25,996
Keizo should be off work by then.

22
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:30,399
If he got our telegram,
he'll be at Osaka Station.

23
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:36,178
Here are your lunches.

24
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:49,317
I'm leaving now.

25
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:54,361
You don't have to see us off
if you're busy at school.

26
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,092
I think I'll have time.

27
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,930
It's during a break.

28
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,737
We'll see you later, then.

29
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,174
I've put tea in the thermos, Mother.

30
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:10,447
I'll be going, then.
- See you then.

31
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:43,420
Do you have the air cushion?

32
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:45,988
Didn't I give it to you?

33
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:48,655
It's not here.

34
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:51,421
I'm sure I gave it to you.

35
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,155
Really?

36
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:57,935
Good morning.

37
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,368
Leaving today?

38
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,510
Yes, this afternoon.

39
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:04,701
Really?

40
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:08,678
This is our chance
to see all our children.

41
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:11,346
That's nice.

42
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,010
They must be looking forward
to your arrival.

43
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,520
Well, I hope so.

44
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,090
Keep an eye on our house
while we're gone, will you?

45
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,851
Of course.

46
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:24,555
Your children have all
turned out so well.

47
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,462
You're vey lucky.

48
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:29,195
I suppose so.

49
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,738
And what beautiful weather.

50
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:34,206
Yes, indeed.

51
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,937
You'll have a lovely trip.

52
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:47,081
I still can't fiind it.

53
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:49,783
No? It must be there.

54
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:54,697
Oh, here it is.

55
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:55,798
You found it?

56
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,457
Yes, I did.

62
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,710
They'll be here soon.

63
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:33,862
Mama!

64
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:43,608
- What do you want?
- Why did you move my desk?

65
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:45,582
To make room for your grandparents.

66
00:08:45,753 --> 00:08:48,119
I want my desk here!

67
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,621
It can't be helped.
We need the space.

68
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:54,092
What about my exams?
I need a place to study.

69
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:56,493
Study anywhere you like!

70
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:08,101
Tell me: Where am I
supposed to study?

71
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:13,010
Mama! Tell me where.

72
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:16,278
Keep quiet.
You never study anyway.

73
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:17,819
I do too.

74
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:20,320
You do not.

75
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:23,359
So I don't have to study, right?

76
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:26,019
No more studying, right?

77
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,859
What are you saying?

78
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,196
They're here.

79
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, you're back.

80
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,305
Please come on in.

81
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,143
Please come in.

82
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,008
Yes, please come in.

83
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:11,808
Sleep well on the train?

84
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:13,575
You must be tired.

85
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:16,183
Vey well.

86
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,687
Come here.

87
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:25,952
Welcome.

88
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:30,126
It's good to see you again.

89
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,636
I just hope
we're not inconveniencing you.

90
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:39,104
It's been a long time, Mother.

91
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:40,607
It really has.

92
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,976
It's wonderful to see you.
How's our sister Kyoko?

93
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,879
Just fiine, thank you.

94
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:49,316
She stayed behind
to look after the house.

95
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:56,054
Fumiko...

96
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,561
I've brought a little something.

97
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,226
Some crackers.

98
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:05,031
Got them in the neighborhood.

99
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:07,698
Mama likes them.

100
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,867
Something to put them on?

101
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,570
A tray will do.

102
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:14,542
How about this?

103
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,274
Fine.

104
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:21,946
Did Noriko come to the station?

105
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:24,422
No, but I phoned her.

106
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,084
Wonder what happened.

107
00:11:26,262 --> 00:11:27,695
Come along.

108
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:33,792
What are you doing?

109
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:35,029
Come here.

110
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:46,180
These are your grandparents.

111
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:50,152
My, aren't they getting big.

112
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:52,449
Minoru is a junior high school student.

113
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,220
He is?

114
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:56,020
How old are you, Isamu?

115
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,925
Tell her.

116
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,605
The bath is ready anytime.

117
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:10,268
How about a bath, Father?

118
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,869
Want to change your clothes, Mama?

119
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,843
Please don't bother.

120
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:16,847
Let's go.

121
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:21,011
Let me cary these.

122
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:40,007
Did Keizo meet you at Osaka?

123
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,634
Yes, he was there.
We had sent him a telegram.

124
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:45,371
Was he all right?

125
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,111
He sent you something.

126
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:50,185
Later's all right.

127
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:51,852
You have a towel, Father?

128
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,216
Yes.

129
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,948
Take your time.

130
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:59,795
What shall we feed them?

131
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:06,197
What about some meat?

132
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:07,361
Maybe sukiyaki.

133
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,098
That sounds good.

134
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,038
And some sashimi.

135
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,942
We don't need that too.

136
00:13:15,115 --> 00:13:16,878
Oh, meat's enough.
We'll just have sukiyaki.

137
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,720
That's Noriko.

138
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:26,888
It's good to see you.

139
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:28,824
- I got to the station late.
- You went?

140
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:32,057
They had already left,
so I missed them.

141
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,904
They're upstairs.

142
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:46,537
I'll just go up and say hello.

143
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:55,721
Welcome to Tokyo.

144
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,261
- What a long time it's been.
- Yes, hasn't it.

145
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:05,664
You must have been vey busy.

146
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:08,134
Not really.

147
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:13,175
But when I fiinished, it was too late.

148
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:17,543
You didn't have to come today.

149
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:19,547
We'll be here for some time.

150
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:23,287
Are you still working
for the same company?

151
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:31,622
It must be hard
to be on your own.

152
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,291
<i>Y</i>our bath is ready.

153
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:36,501
Coming.

154
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,175
Let me help you.

155
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,616
Oh, that's all right.

156
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:57,452
It's like a dream being in Tokyo.

157
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:03,992
And it didn't seem so far.

158
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:06,168
Yesterday we were in Onomichi,

159
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:09,601
and today here we are with you.

160
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,112
I'm glad I lived to this day.
The world has changed so.

161
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:20,415
But you haven't changed at all.

162
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,124
Of course we have.
We're old folks now.

163
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,051
Ma<i>m</i>a.

164
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,389
Let's go downstairs.

165
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,541
Mama, you've grown taller.

166
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,400
Don't be silly.
How could I have grown?

167
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:48,412
But you have.
And you're even fatter.

168
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:52,445
She was so big
when I was little

169
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:55,522
that I used to feel ashamed
in front of my friends.

170
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:58,256
Once in school,
a chair broke under her.

171
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:01,453
Oh, that chair was already broken.

172
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:03,121
She still thinks that.

173
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:04,926
Well, it was.

174
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:07,001
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

175
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,496
I'll put this away.

176
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,740
- What about this?
- Leave it there.

177
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,723
It's cooler now.

178
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:37,230
It must be vey hot in Onomichi.

179
00:17:37,402 --> 00:17:40,337
Yes, it is.

180
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:43,302
Mother, how is Mrs. Ko?

181
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:49,073
She really must have been born
under an unlucky star.

182
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,610
She's had bad luck this year again.

183
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:55,653
After her husband died,
she married a man in Kurashiki.

184
00:17:55,822 --> 00:17:58,791
Took her child with her.

185
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,118
But I hear she's not so happy.

186
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:05,027
Poor woman.

187
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,328
Papa, what was the name of that man?

188
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:10,937
The one who worked for the city.

189
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,875
Mr. Mihashi? He died.

190
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:17,375
Some time ago.

191
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,035
Yes, that's right.

192
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:22,776
Remember Mr. Hattori?

193
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,977
Of the Militay Affairs Section?

194
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:26,712
I remember him.

195
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,491
He's living in Tokyo now.

196
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:31,921
Really?

197
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:35,223
I plan to visit him.

198
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:36,387
Where does he live?

199
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,727
He lives in the Taito Ward.

200
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:40,699
His address is in my notebook.

201
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:44,499
Finished?

202
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:50,304
Have one - from Keizo.

203
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:56,518
He's sound asleep.

204
00:18:56,688 --> 00:19:00,146
Don't bother. Let him sleep.

205
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:03,856
They'll go sightseeing tomorrow?

206
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,055
I'll take them around.

207
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,666
Good. Shall we leave, Noriko?

208
00:19:08,835 --> 00:19:11,269
I suppose so.

209
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,533
It was good of you to come.

210
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:19,679
I'll see you soon, Papa.

211
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:25,076
Don't bother.

212
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:40,796
Sory to stay so long.

213
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:57,312
You must be tired, Father.

214
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:01,152
Mama, how about going to bed?

215
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,424
Shall we go to bed, then?

216
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:07,756
Good night.

217
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:24,112
I'll bring some water.

218
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:51,871
Aren't you tired?

219
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:53,709
Not really.

220
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,413
I'm glad they're all well.

221
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:05,661
We're here at last.

222
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,421
Yes.

223
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,231
What part ofTokyo is this, I wonder?

224
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,000
A suburb, I think.

225
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,641
It must be.

226
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,069
It was a long ride from the station.

227
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:28,018
I thought it would be
in some livelier part of the city.

228
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,815
Here?

229
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:36,757
Koichi wanted to move
to a livelier place,

230
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:40,559
but I'm afraid it wasn't easy.

231
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:09,265
OOH LA LA BEAUTY PARLOR

232
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:32,884
How long will they stay in Tokyo?

233
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:34,616
A few more days.

234
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:39,895
Shouldn't I go see them?

235
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:42,933
Don't bother.
They'll come here anyway.

236
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,674
I'll take them to a show
or something.

237
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:52,141
You needn't bother.

238
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:58,777
These beans are good.

239
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:04,948
What are they doing today?

240
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:09,729
Don't eat them all up.

241
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:13,633
Today my brother's
taking them somewhere.

242
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:16,931
Really? Then I'm free.

243
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,865
Breakfast time, Kiyo-chan.

244
00:23:23,346 --> 00:23:27,374
Behave yourselves.
Grandma and Grandma will be with us.

245
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:29,018
Do you understand?

246
00:23:29,186 --> 00:23:30,744
I understand.

247
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,955
- We're late. Aren't we going?
- Yes, soon.

248
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,756
Go upstairs and ask them
if they're ready.

249
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:49,732
Are you ready?

250
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:51,276
We've kept you waiting.

251
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:53,436
He says we can go now.

252
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:01,778
- Let's go.
- All right.

253
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:07,988
Where will you eat?

254
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:11,655
At the department store.

255
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,165
The children will like that.

256
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:16,827
Good. Isamu likes
the children's lunch there.

257
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:38,118
How is he?

258
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,362
Any appetite?

259
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:46,993
No. He'll only drink something cold.

260
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:52,232
- Did his fever go down?
- His temperature is still 102.

261
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:54,208
I'd better go see him.

262
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:58,008
Thank you.
I'm sory to spoil your Sunday.

263
00:25:07,928 --> 00:25:09,827
Are the hypodermics disinfected?

264
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:11,555
I must see a patient.

265
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:18,929
Father, I've got to go see a sick child.

266
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:21,268
He's not doing well.

267
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,706
I'm sory.
- We'll wait.

268
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:27,973
It may take quite a while.

269
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,119
That's all right.

270
00:25:31,854 --> 00:25:33,412
I'm sory, Mother.

271
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:37,625
Aren't we going yet?

272
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:47,335
I may be late.

273
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,302
What will we do about them?

274
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:51,401
Shall I take them?

275
00:25:52,877 --> 00:25:55,778
You can't leave the house
without someone here.

276
00:25:56,815 --> 00:25:58,146
We'll just go next Sunday.

277
00:25:58,317 --> 00:26:01,252
All right.

278
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:11,055
- Where's he going?
- To a patient's.

279
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,762
I'm awfully sory.

280
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:22,774
No, no.
A good doctor is a busy doctor.

281
00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:25,174
He works vey hard.

282
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:27,542
Mama, aren't we going?

283
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,949
It can't be helped.
A patient needs him.

284
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,087
It's not fair.

285
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:35,923
There'll be another time.

286
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,484
Minoru, behave yourself.
Just leave the room.

287
00:26:39,661 --> 00:26:41,856
- You liar!
- You heard me!

288
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:48,501
- Come here.
- Don't want to.

289
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,871
Bad boys!

290
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,804
Well, boys should be lively.

291
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:07,892
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

292
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,583
It's no fair!

293
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,292
But we'll go next time.

294
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,365
Always next time!

295
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,001
We never go!

296
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,501
It can't be helped.

297
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:20,866
You always say that.

298
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,373
Don't be so diffiicult.

299
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,102
It's not fair!

300
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:33,046
Behave yourself
or I'll tell your father.

301
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,414
Go ahead.

302
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:37,423
Vey well.
Remember those words.

303
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:39,992
I'm not afraid.

304
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,863
What's the matter?

305
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,557
I just don't know.

306
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:49,693
Come on, Isamu.
Let's take a walk.

307
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:51,404
Minoru too.

308
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:55,201
Let's go.

309
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:57,141
Go with Grandma, all right?

310
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,315
Why don't you come too?
We're going.

311
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,949
I'm sory.

312
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,193
Minoru, go with her.

313
00:28:12,363 --> 00:28:13,261
Don't want to!

314
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:15,024
As you like.

315
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,612
What's the matter?

316
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:04,249
He's so stubborn.

317
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:09,221
So was Koichi.
Never listened to anyone.

318
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:11,918
Always had to have his own way.

319
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:15,189
You must be disappointed, Father.

320
00:29:15,365 --> 00:29:17,697
No, not at all.

321
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:20,336
We'll go next Sunday.

322
00:29:20,504 --> 00:29:22,598
That would be fiine.

323
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:28,110
After a few days here,
I think we'll go to Shige's.

324
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:36,821
Look. There they are.

325
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:06,680
What are you going to be
when you grow up?

326
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:16,820
A doctor like your father?

327
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,162
By the time you become a doctor,
I wonder if I'll still be here.

328
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:32,471
There was a phone call
from Mr. Enomoto about the job.

329
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:34,480
Then it's all arranged.

330
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:40,147
Where are they?

331
00:31:40,324 --> 00:31:41,882
Upstairs.

332
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,088
I bought some cakes for them.

333
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:52,269
Have one. They're good.

334
00:31:54,306 --> 00:31:58,266
They don't need such expensive cakes.

335
00:32:03,683 --> 00:32:04,672
Good, eh?

336
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,053
Good, but too expensive.

337
00:32:08,222 --> 00:32:11,282
Crackers would have been
good enough for them.

338
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,551
But they had crackers yesterday.

339
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:16,891
They like them.

340
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:23,868
Will you take them
out somewhere tomorrow?

341
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:25,768
Tomorrow?

342
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:29,306
I'm afraid I'll have
to collect some bills.

343
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:31,139
I see.

344
00:32:33,282 --> 00:32:36,116
Koichi should do something.

345
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,617
How about the Kinsha-tei tonight?

346
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:40,153
What's on?

347
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:41,984
Some naniwabushi recital.

348
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:44,650
That's good.
They'd like that.

349
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,820
They haven't gone anywhere
since they got here.

350
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,626
Too bad they have
to stay upstairs all day.

351
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,101
It is, but there's nobody
to take them out.

352
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:43,321
She's got you working.

353
00:33:43,492 --> 00:33:45,619
Well, hello.

354
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,091
What a job.

355
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:55,405
Where's Father?

356
00:33:55,572 --> 00:33:56,937
Up on the laundy platform.

357
00:33:57,107 --> 00:33:59,735
Don't you want to go to the baths?

358
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:09,446
Father.

359
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:14,520
Let's go to the baths.

360
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,210
Oh, hello.

361
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:37,544
Let's go out to a public bath.

362
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,018
And get ice cream on the way back.

363
00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:43,555
Why, thank you.

364
00:35:05,915 --> 00:35:07,815
We're going off to the baths.

365
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:16,724
Use my wooden sandals, Mother.
The old ones.

366
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:19,957
Really?

367
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:48,589
Hello.
Is this the Yoneyama Firm?

368
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:51,891
May I speak to Noriko Hirayama?
Thank you.

369
00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:00,172
Noriko? It's me.

370
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,434
Oh, no. Don't mention it.

371
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,009
Look, I need a favor.

372
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:09,709
Do you have any time
to spare tomorrow?

373
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:13,583
Father and Mother
haven't been anywhere yet.

374
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,485
That's right.

375
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:20,528
I wonder if you could take them out
somewhere tomorrow.

376
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:27,402
I really should take them myself,
but I'm just too busy.

377
00:36:27,973 --> 00:36:30,965
Sory to trouble you.

378
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:40,084
No problem at all.
Will you wait a second?

379
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:48,661
Excuse me.

380
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,990
May I have the day off tomorrow?

381
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:55,191
Thank you.
- How about Asahi Aluminum?

382
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:57,531
I'll fiinish it today.

383
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:04,270
Hello? Sory to keep you waiting.

384
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:07,379
I'll be at your place
at 9:00 tomorrow.

385
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:11,953
No, don't wory.
Give them my best regards.

386
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:13,448
See you tomorrow.

387
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,497
Ladies and gent<i>l</i>e<i>m</i>en,
we<i>l</i>co<i>m</i>e to To<i>k</i>yo.

388
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:31,232
Let's trace the histo<i>ry</i>
o<i>f</i> the great city o<i>f</i> To<i>k</i>yo.

389
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:37,171
The <i>Im</i>peria<i>l</i> Pa<i>l</i>ace,
<i>f</i>or<i>m</i>er<i>l</i>y ca<i>ll</i>ed the Chiyoda Cast<i>l</i>e,

390
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:42,547
was bui<i>l</i>t so<i>m</i>e <i>500</i> years ago
by Lord Do<i>k</i>an Ota.

391
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,749
<i>I</i>ts quiet setting
with its green pine trees and <i>m</i>oat

392
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:51,760
is quite a contrast
to the bust<i>l</i>e o<i>f</i> To<i>k</i>yo.

393
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,320
Koichi's house is that way.

394
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:54,594
And Shige's?

395
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:59,261
Probably over there.

396
00:39:00,673 --> 00:39:02,039
And yours?

397
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,574
My place is -

398
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,315
Someplace over there, I think.

399
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:18,688
It's really a mess,
but I hope you'll drop in later.

400
00:39:47,457 --> 00:39:48,549
Who is it?

401
00:39:50,227 --> 00:39:51,626
Me.

402
00:39:51,795 --> 00:39:53,262
You're back early.

403
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,524
- Is Miko-chan asleep?
- She just went to bed.

404
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,668
Do you have any sake?

405
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:03,063
My parents-in-law are visiting.

406
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:05,402
I have a little.

407
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,215
Is this enough?

408
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:27,992
Where did he have this photo taken?

409
00:40:29,237 --> 00:40:31,762
Kamakura. A friend of his took it.

410
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:33,866
When was it?

411
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,439
Ayear before he was drafted.

412
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:42,075
So like him.

413
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:44,349
With his head to one side.

414
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,546
He always stood like that.

415
00:40:57,701 --> 00:40:58,827
What is it?

416
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:00,698
Do you have some cups?

417
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:07,238
Just washed them.

418
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:11,849
Take these stewed green peppers.

419
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:15,453
Thank you.
I keep bothering you.

420
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:30,632
Don't go to any trouble, Noriko.

421
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:33,169
It's no trouble at all.

422
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:39,175
Thank you so much for today.

423
00:41:39,346 --> 00:41:41,007
Not at all.

424
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:43,741
But I'm afraid you're tired.

425
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:45,009
Oh, no.

426
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:48,346
We saw so many places,
thanks to you.

427
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,906
I'm sory you had to spend
the whole day with us.

428
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:09,678
Was it really all right?

429
00:42:09,846 --> 00:42:12,440
Certainly, Father.
Please don't wory.

430
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:14,174
We used to work even on Sunday.

431
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:17,378
Now, we're not so busy,
so I can take a day off.

432
00:42:17,555 --> 00:42:19,989
Really? Then it's all right.

433
00:42:40,446 --> 00:42:43,438
I don't have much here.

434
00:42:49,356 --> 00:42:51,881
It's vey good.

435
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,027
Do you like drinking, Father?

436
00:42:55,196 --> 00:42:58,859
Indeed he does.

437
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,970
In the old days he used to get angy
when the sake ran out.

438
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:06,199
Even at midnight
he'd go out for more.

439
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,143
Evey time a boy was born,

440
00:43:10,313 --> 00:43:14,978
I prayed he wouldn't
become a drinker.

441
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:17,611
Did Shoji like to drink?

442
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:20,547
Yes, he did.

443
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:23,592
Really?

444
00:43:24,928 --> 00:43:28,022
He'd go drinking after work,
and sometimes when it would get late,

445
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:31,897
he'd bring his drinking buddies
home with him.

446
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:33,731
Really?

447
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:37,204
Then you had
as much trouble as I did.

448
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,967
Yes.

449
00:43:39,644 --> 00:43:43,479
But now I miss it.

450
00:43:43,649 --> 00:43:46,016
Poor Shoji.

451
00:43:46,385 --> 00:43:48,649
He lived so far from us.

452
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:51,723
I feel as if he were still alive
somewhere.

453
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:57,161
Father often scolds me
for my foolishness.

454
00:43:57,598 --> 00:44:01,864
He must be dead.
It's eight years since...

455
00:44:02,036 --> 00:44:04,300
I know, but...

456
00:44:05,406 --> 00:44:11,277
He was such a willful boy.
I'm afraid he gave you trouble.

457
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:19,777
It seems he really caused you
some problems.

458
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:36,366
I hope it's good.

459
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,839
Please, Mother.

460
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:45,280
Help yourself.

461
00:45:25,427 --> 00:45:26,985
They're late.

462
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:29,131
They'll be back soon.

463
00:45:34,036 --> 00:45:36,504
How long will they stay in Tokyo?

464
00:45:41,277 --> 00:45:43,268
Didn't they tell you?

465
00:45:47,484 --> 00:45:49,113
Listen...

466
00:45:50,888 --> 00:45:54,654
would you put up some money?

467
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,057
What for?

468
00:45:57,094 --> 00:45:58,926
I'm putting some in too.

469
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:03,124
Two thousand yen or so,
maybe three.

470
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:04,563
Why?

471
00:46:05,837 --> 00:46:08,898
What do you say to sending them
to the Atami Hot Springs?

472
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:15,573
You're busy, and I can't change
my work schedule either.

473
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:20,275
We can't always ask Noriko.

474
00:46:21,522 --> 00:46:22,750
Not a bad idea.

475
00:46:22,923 --> 00:46:25,517
I know a nice hotel.

476
00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:27,790
Inexpensive, with a good view.

477
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,428
Good.

478
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:32,664
Let's do it, then.

479
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:35,428
I'm sure they'll like it.

480
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,501
Frankly, I was worried.

481
00:46:40,776 --> 00:46:43,768
It costs money wherever we take them.

482
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:46,916
This is less expensive.

483
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,816
And there's the hot springs too.

484
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,054
What are you talking about?

485
00:47:01,766 --> 00:47:06,830
We're planning to send
Father and Mother to Atami.

486
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:08,836
Good idea.

487
00:47:09,007 --> 00:47:13,171
I've been worried about them too,
but I'm really busy.

488
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:14,643
What do you think?

489
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:16,304
Good.

490
00:47:16,482 --> 00:47:18,279
I agree.

491
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,416
Let's do it.

492
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:23,184
We can't do anything for them here.

493
00:47:23,356 --> 00:47:27,088
Right. Atami's the place.

494
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:29,591
They can enjoy the baths and rest.

495
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:34,827
An old couple would like that better
than walking around Tokyo.

496
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:37,027
That's right.

497
00:47:39,473 --> 00:47:41,373
My, they're late.

498
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:44,605
Maybe they're at Noriko's.

499
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,508
Probably.

500
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:31,428
I've never been able to come to a spa.

501
00:48:32,365 --> 00:48:35,459
We've cost them more money.

502
00:48:36,403 --> 00:48:38,769
Doesn't it feel nice here?

503
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,600
Let's get up early in the morning

504
00:48:42,777 --> 00:48:44,540
and take a walk along the beach.

505
00:48:44,712 --> 00:48:46,543
Good.

506
00:48:46,714 --> 00:48:51,516
There must be many good views.

507
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,118
A maid here told me so.

508
00:48:54,289 --> 00:48:55,847
Really?

509
00:48:58,794 --> 00:49:01,389
The sea is so quiet.

510
00:49:53,186 --> 00:49:55,984
- Thank you for waiting.
- The noodles are ready.

511
00:49:57,725 --> 00:50:00,125
- Oh, so you had that piece.
- Ouch, that hurt.

512
00:50:03,698 --> 00:50:05,757
Discard.

513
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,596
There it is.
- I'll take that one.

514
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:12,033
- Ready.
- Ready?

515
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:14,732
- You discarded this one, right?
- Yeah, I did.

516
00:50:15,644 --> 00:50:18,375
How do you like that, idiot?

517
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,512
That makes 1632.

518
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,383
He beat us.

519
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:04,591
It's awfully lively.

520
00:51:13,775 --> 00:51:16,506
What time is it now?

521
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,685
What's the matter?

522
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:35,894
It's because
you didn't sleep well last night.

523
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:40,367
No, but you did.

524
00:53:40,535 --> 00:53:43,733
I couldn't sleep a wink.

525
00:53:43,906 --> 00:53:46,932
You did. You snored.

526
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:48,634
Really?

527
00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:52,910
Anyway, this place is meant
for the younger generation.

528
00:53:53,082 --> 00:53:54,640
That's true.

529
00:54:06,563 --> 00:54:10,158
Those newlyweds last night.

530
00:54:10,535 --> 00:54:12,969
Do you believe
they're really newlyweds?

531
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:17,097
This morning she was smoking in bed
after he got up.

532
00:54:17,275 --> 00:54:18,469
He's an idiot.

533
00:54:18,643 --> 00:54:21,613
He said, "You belong to me.

534
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:25,273
Your ears, eyes, mouth -
All of you is mine."

535
00:54:25,451 --> 00:54:27,976
Who knew what belongs to who?

536
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:40,857
I wonder what Kyoko
is doing at home now.

537
00:54:44,105 --> 00:54:45,697
Let's go back home.

538
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:50,873
You must be homesick already.

539
00:54:51,046 --> 00:54:55,608
You're the one
who really wants to go home.

540
00:54:57,686 --> 00:54:59,814
We've seen Tokyo.

541
00:54:59,989 --> 00:55:02,014
We've seen Atami.

542
00:55:02,525 --> 00:55:03,958
Let's go home.

543
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:07,722
Yes.

544
00:55:21,847 --> 00:55:23,439
What's the matter?

545
00:55:26,852 --> 00:55:29,845
I felt a bit dizzy.

546
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:31,421
I'm all right now.

547
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:34,458
You didn't sleep well.
That's why.

548
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:12,266
Shall we ty the upsweep?
I'm sure it would become you.

549
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:16,201
You have a good neckline.

550
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:20,332
Make the left side tight
and add a fluffy wave on this side.

551
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,171
Maybe next time I'll ty that.

552
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:25,075
It would be vey stylish.

553
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,913
Get me another magazine
and matches.

554
00:56:43,268 --> 00:56:45,100
Welcome back.

555
00:56:47,674 --> 00:56:50,939
Why, you're back so soon.

556
00:56:55,616 --> 00:56:59,347
You should've stayed longer!

557
00:57:06,895 --> 00:57:08,453
We're home.

558
00:57:19,642 --> 00:57:20,768
Who are they?

559
00:57:20,943 --> 00:57:23,811
Oh, just friends from the county.

560
00:57:27,084 --> 00:57:29,484
Here, do these pin curls.

561
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:44,502
Why didn't you stay longer?

562
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:46,729
How was Atami?

563
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:49,136
Vey nice.
We liked the baths.

564
00:57:49,308 --> 00:57:52,836
We had a nice view
from the hotel window.

565
00:57:53,013 --> 00:57:57,109
That was a nice modern hotel.

566
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,542
Was it crowded?

567
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,847
A bit crowded, I'd say.

568
00:58:02,022 --> 00:58:04,081
How was the food?

569
00:58:04,257 --> 00:58:06,248
Vey good fiish -

570
00:58:06,426 --> 00:58:09,793
Of course.
It's right on the sea.

571
00:58:09,963 --> 00:58:12,933
And they served big omelets, too.

572
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:17,298
Why didn't you stay
for a few days longer?

573
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,871
We wanted you to relax.

574
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:24,235
We think it's about time we went home.

575
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:28,406
It's too soon.
You don't come up to Tokyo vey often.

576
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:31,451
But we'd better be going.

577
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:34,454
Kyoko may be lonesome at home, too.

578
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:38,822
Mother, she isn't a baby anymore.

579
00:58:38,995 --> 00:58:41,794
Here I was, planning
to take you to see the Kabuki.

580
00:58:43,767 --> 00:58:47,134
We don't want to put you
to so much expense.

581
00:58:47,304 --> 00:58:50,398
Never mind that.

582
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:55,974
However, I've a meeting here tonight
with the other beauticians.

583
00:58:57,315 --> 00:58:59,374
Are many coming?

584
00:58:59,551 --> 00:59:02,646
It's my turn to provide the place.

585
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:05,950
We came back at the wrong time.

586
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,356
That's why we wanted you
to stay at Atami.

587
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:12,157
I should have told you so.

588
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,435
We've done the pin curls.

589
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:18,166
Just a minute.

590
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:34,411
What'll we do?

591
00:59:36,558 --> 00:59:38,025
I don't know.

592
00:59:39,462 --> 00:59:43,865
We can't go back to Koichi's again
and trouble them anymore.

593
00:59:44,034 --> 00:59:45,763
That's true.

594
00:59:47,037 --> 00:59:49,769
Shall we go to Noriko's?

595
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,103
She can't have both of us.

596
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:55,005
You go there alone.

597
00:59:56,113 --> 00:59:57,808
What about you?

598
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:01,948
I think I'll visit the Hattoris.

599
01:00:02,154 --> 01:00:04,520
I'll stay overnight if I can.

600
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:08,058
In any case, we should leave.

601
01:00:17,102 --> 01:00:20,300
We're really homeless now.

602
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:14,557
Noriko may be home by now.

603
01:01:16,235 --> 01:01:18,465
It may be a bit early.

604
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:24,200
But if you want to visit the Hattoris,
you'd better go now.

605
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:27,814
Yes, we'd better go.

606
01:01:50,405 --> 01:01:52,873
You're so forgetful.

607
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:19,233
Look how big Tokyo is.

608
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:20,961
Yes, isn't it?

609
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:24,367
If we got lost,

610
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:27,909
we'd never fiind each other again.

611
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:51,034
HATTORI - PROFESSIONAL SCRI BE

612
01:02:55,509 --> 01:02:58,103
I can't believe it's been so long.

613
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:02,147
It's already 17 or 18 years.

614
01:03:03,452 --> 01:03:06,285
You've sent me
a New Year's card evey year.

615
01:03:06,455 --> 01:03:08,082
And so have you.

616
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,927
I suppose Onomichi
has changed a great deal.

617
01:03:13,196 --> 01:03:16,597
Fortunately the city
wasn't bombed in the war.

618
01:03:16,766 --> 01:03:20,862
The place where you lived
is still as it used to be.

619
01:03:21,178 --> 01:03:24,840
Is that so?
It was a nice place.

620
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:30,047
We used to like
the view from the temple.

621
01:03:30,786 --> 01:03:33,982
After the chery season,
the price of fiish would always drop.

622
01:03:34,155 --> 01:03:37,123
All these years, we've missed
the taste of that wonderful fiish.

623
01:03:44,328 --> 01:03:45,795
Later.

624
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:52,997
Tell my friends
I'll be playing pinball, will you?

625
01:03:57,372 --> 01:04:02,138
We rent the upstairs room to that man.
A real playboy.

626
01:04:03,109 --> 01:04:07,238
He's a law student,
but he never studies.

627
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,837
He spends his time
at pinball and mahjong.

628
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:14,575
I'm sory for his father back home.

629
01:04:19,054 --> 01:04:22,114
Let's go out for a drink somewhere.

630
01:04:23,124 --> 01:04:26,354
I just don't seem to have
anything in the house.

631
01:04:26,526 --> 01:04:28,653
No, I didn't tell you I was coming.

632
01:04:28,829 --> 01:04:32,594
Do you remember our old police chief?

633
01:04:33,032 --> 01:04:36,159
- Numata?
- He lives nearby.

634
01:04:36,334 --> 01:04:38,699
Is that so?
How's he doing now?

635
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:40,359
He's retired.

636
01:04:40,537 --> 01:04:43,198
His son is a big man
at a big printing company.

637
01:04:43,372 --> 01:04:45,806
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

638
01:04:45,975 --> 01:04:47,066
Let's go see him.

639
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:49,301
By all means.

640
01:04:49,478 --> 01:04:51,274
That would be fiine.

641
01:05:10,726 --> 01:05:13,524
- Have some more sake.
- I've had plenty.

642
01:05:13,696 --> 01:05:16,596
Drink up, for old time's sake.

643
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:22,893
I haven't drunk for a long time.

644
01:05:23,069 --> 01:05:24,866
You used to be a real drinker.

645
01:05:25,037 --> 01:05:27,436
Remember the governor's visit
to Onomichi?

646
01:05:27,606 --> 01:05:29,471
At Takemuraya?

647
01:05:30,374 --> 01:05:32,171
You got drunk.

648
01:05:32,343 --> 01:05:34,902
That young geisha who served -

649
01:05:35,078 --> 01:05:36,067
Umeko?

650
01:05:36,246 --> 01:05:37,837
You liked her, didn't you?

651
01:05:40,082 --> 01:05:44,313
And the governor happened
to like her too, remember?

652
01:05:45,318 --> 01:05:46,842
You liked her too, eh?

653
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:52,753
Oh, the fool I've always
made of myself by drinking.

654
01:05:52,925 --> 01:05:57,292
Oh, no. Sake is good for the health.

655
01:06:01,064 --> 01:06:05,226
You're lucky your children
are all settled.

656
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,664
Oh, I don't know about that.

657
01:06:07,836 --> 01:06:12,795
I often wish at least
one of my sons were alive.

658
01:06:12,972 --> 01:06:15,702
Must have been hard
to lose both of them.

659
01:06:16,409 --> 01:06:18,000
Didn't you lose one?

660
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:21,710
Yes, my second son.

661
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,642
I've had enough of war.

662
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,747
Yes, indeed.

663
01:06:30,085 --> 01:06:34,748
To lose your children is hard,

664
01:06:34,923 --> 01:06:38,722
but living with them
isn't always easy, either.

665
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:40,992
A real dilemma.

666
01:06:43,896 --> 01:06:45,123
Drink.

667
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:50,259
Let's change the subject.

668
01:06:51,635 --> 01:06:53,158
And cheer up.

669
01:06:54,571 --> 01:06:59,439
If I had an extra bedroom for you,
we'd drink till morning.

670
01:07:03,711 --> 01:07:05,871
Miss, more sake!

671
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:18,588
Anyway, I'm vey glad you came.

672
01:07:19,356 --> 01:07:23,155
I never dreamed
I'd see you here in Tokyo.

673
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,564
OKAYA ODEN

674
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:59,280
Here's a warm one.

675
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,947
Pour it for me.

676
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:05,316
You're so drunk.

677
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:11,624
Look, Hirayama.
She resembles someone, doesn't she?

678
01:08:11,794 --> 01:08:13,352
There he goes again.

679
01:08:13,529 --> 01:08:15,462
Don't you think so?

680
01:08:15,631 --> 01:08:17,861
Well, who?

681
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:20,565
Yes, she does.

682
01:08:21,202 --> 01:08:22,499
That young geisha?

683
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:26,196
Oh, no! She was fatter.

684
01:08:26,473 --> 01:08:28,030
This one resembles my wife.

685
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:29,936
Yes, you're right.

686
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:32,235
See, especially here -

687
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:35,572
Why don't you leave?
You've had enough.

688
01:08:35,746 --> 01:08:37,338
And both are bad-tempered.

689
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:38,640
You're a real nuisance.

690
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:40,975
My wife says so too.

691
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:45,584
Come here and pour for me.

692
01:08:47,588 --> 01:08:49,579
Have some more.

693
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:51,747
No, thanks.

694
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,725
I think you're
the luckiest one of all.

695
01:08:59,897 --> 01:09:01,455
How come?

696
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:06,062
With good sons and daughters
to be proud of.

697
01:09:06,236 --> 01:09:08,499
You can be proud of yours too.

698
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:11,605
No, my son's no good.

699
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:15,739
He's henpecked
and treats me like I'm in the way.

700
01:09:15,909 --> 01:09:17,570
He's nothing.

701
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:23,207
But being department head
is a good position.

702
01:09:23,381 --> 01:09:26,214
Department head, nothing!

703
01:09:26,383 --> 01:09:28,408
He's only an assistant section chief.

704
01:09:28,852 --> 01:09:31,285
I get to feeling so low

705
01:09:31,454 --> 01:09:35,753
that I lie to people.

706
01:09:35,924 --> 01:09:37,186
He's a failure.

707
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:40,551
I don't think so.

708
01:09:41,662 --> 01:09:46,688
He's my only son, so I spared the rod -
and spoiled him.

709
01:09:48,033 --> 01:09:52,128
You brought your son up proper.

710
01:09:52,303 --> 01:09:55,100
He has a degree.

711
01:09:55,706 --> 01:09:58,902
But all doctors have to have degrees.

712
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:04,377
I'm afraid we expect
too much of our children.

713
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,645
They lack spirit.

714
01:10:07,881 --> 01:10:11,077
They lack ambition.

715
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,116
I've told that to my son.

716
01:10:14,352 --> 01:10:17,787
He said that there are
too many people in Tokyo.

717
01:10:17,955 --> 01:10:20,150
That it's hard to get ahead.

718
01:10:20,524 --> 01:10:21,717
What do you think?

719
01:10:21,891 --> 01:10:24,359
Young people today have no backbone.

720
01:10:24,527 --> 01:10:28,121
Where is their spirit?

721
01:10:28,363 --> 01:10:30,262
That's not how I raised him!

722
01:10:31,532 --> 01:10:34,091
But Numata -

723
01:10:36,002 --> 01:10:38,094
You don't agree with me?

724
01:10:38,504 --> 01:10:39,835
You're satisfiied?

725
01:10:40,005 --> 01:10:43,235
Of course not, but -

726
01:10:43,408 --> 01:10:47,844
You see?
Even you're not satisfiied.

727
01:10:53,815 --> 01:10:56,340
I feel so sad.

728
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:59,717
No more to drink.

729
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:10,919
However, until I came up to Tokyo,

730
01:11:11,095 --> 01:11:15,690
I was under the impression
that my son was doing better.

731
01:11:16,633 --> 01:11:21,466
But I've found that he is
only a small neighborhood doctor.

732
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:24,204
I know how you feel.

733
01:11:24,372 --> 01:11:27,135
I'm as dissatisfiied as you are.

734
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:33,471
But we can't expect too much
from our children.

735
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:37,912
Times have changed.
We have to face it.

736
01:11:38,249 --> 01:11:39,978
That's what I think.

737
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:41,842
It is?

738
01:11:43,686 --> 01:11:45,084
I see.

739
01:11:45,254 --> 01:11:47,119
You, too!

740
01:11:48,023 --> 01:11:51,014
My son has really changed,

741
01:11:51,192 --> 01:11:53,489
but I can't help it.

742
01:11:54,761 --> 01:11:59,697
After all, there are
too many people in Tokyo.

743
01:11:59,865 --> 01:12:02,059
Do you think so?

744
01:12:02,233 --> 01:12:05,463
I suppose I should be happy.

745
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:08,496
Maybe you're right.

746
01:12:10,106 --> 01:12:15,839
Nowadays some young men
kill their parents without a thought.

747
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:20,102
Mine at least wouldn't do that.

748
01:12:23,783 --> 01:12:26,080
Look, it's midnight.

749
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,249
So what?

750
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:32,018
It's closing time.

751
01:12:34,658 --> 01:12:38,684
You get more and more like my wife.
I like you, you know?

752
01:12:38,861 --> 01:12:41,328
Do something with him.

753
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:44,424
Leave him alone.

754
01:12:44,631 --> 01:12:48,430
Let's drink up tonight.

755
01:12:48,968 --> 01:12:50,833
Wonderful, wonderful.

756
01:12:52,204 --> 01:12:54,968
Yes, a wonderful night.

757
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:33,096
Thank you.
That's quite enough.

758
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:39,104
It's been a long day today.

759
01:13:39,572 --> 01:13:41,938
Back from Atami,

760
01:13:42,141 --> 01:13:44,734
then to Shige's house,

761
01:13:45,477 --> 01:13:47,706
then to Ueno Park.

762
01:13:47,879 --> 01:13:49,904
You must be tired.

763
01:13:50,081 --> 01:13:51,945
No, not so much,

764
01:13:52,582 --> 01:13:55,675
and here I am, troubling you.

765
01:13:55,885 --> 01:13:58,285
I'm vey sory.

766
01:13:59,888 --> 01:14:02,550
But I really appreciate your coming.

767
01:14:02,723 --> 01:14:05,317
I'm so happy.

768
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:08,588
I'm a burden to eveyone.

769
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:11,188
There now.

770
01:14:13,398 --> 01:14:15,922
That's enough, really.

771
01:14:24,706 --> 01:14:29,404
You must go to bed now.
You have your work tomorrow morning.

772
01:14:29,577 --> 01:14:33,637
You need sleep, too.
Let's both go to bed.

773
01:14:33,813 --> 01:14:38,407
Thank you. I think I will.

774
01:14:49,759 --> 01:14:55,024
What a treat
to sleep in my dead son's bed.

775
01:15:03,468 --> 01:15:05,333
Noriko.

776
01:15:06,637 --> 01:15:09,833
Forgive me if I'm rude,

777
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:15,276
but it's been eight years
since my son's death,

778
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:20,506
yet you still keep
his photo here like that.

779
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:24,476
I feel sory for you.

780
01:15:25,518 --> 01:15:26,849
Why?

781
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:30,477
Because you're young and -

782
01:15:32,257 --> 01:15:33,951
I'm not that young anymore.

783
01:15:34,124 --> 01:15:36,183
Yes, you are.

784
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,887
I feel we're doing wrong.

785
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:43,890
I've often talked to Father about this.

786
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:46,565
Should you have the chance,

787
01:15:46,734 --> 01:15:50,829
please get married,
anytime you want.

788
01:15:51,938 --> 01:15:53,598
I mean it.

789
01:15:53,772 --> 01:15:58,640
It pains us that you won't remary.

790
01:15:59,477 --> 01:16:01,535
All right. If I have the chance -

791
01:16:01,712 --> 01:16:04,374
You certainly will.

792
01:16:04,548 --> 01:16:06,640
Why wouldn't you?

793
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:08,715
You think so?

794
01:16:08,884 --> 01:16:13,546
You had more trouble
than happiness after marying him.

795
01:16:13,988 --> 01:16:18,253
I know we should have
done something for you.

796
01:16:18,424 --> 01:16:21,654
Please. I'm quite happy.

797
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:26,763
But you should have had
a better life.

798
01:16:26,931 --> 01:16:28,921
I'm happy.

799
01:16:29,099 --> 01:16:31,363
I like it this way.

800
01:16:32,202 --> 01:16:35,193
You may be happy
while you're still young.

801
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:41,239
But as you become older,
you'll fiind it lonely.

802
01:16:41,408 --> 01:16:45,070
I won't get that old,
so don't wory.

803
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:51,208
You're so nice.

804
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:54,610
Good night, then.

805
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:10,454
Good night.

806
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:02,162
Excuse me.
Mr. And Mrs. Kaneko?

807
01:18:03,203 --> 01:18:05,227
Who is it?

808
01:18:05,838 --> 01:18:07,395
Who could it be?

809
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:17,042
- Who is it?
- The police. Offiicer Takashi.

810
01:18:27,654 --> 01:18:29,713
I've brought you your friends.

811
01:18:29,889 --> 01:18:31,856
They're quite drunk.

812
01:18:33,358 --> 01:18:35,848
Why, Father!

813
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:40,089
Good night.

814
01:18:53,774 --> 01:18:55,764
Who's he, Father?

815
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:05,574
Father, what is all this?

816
01:19:06,517 --> 01:19:08,211
Father!

817
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,712
What's happened?

818
01:19:13,755 --> 01:19:15,221
He's not alone.

819
01:19:15,389 --> 01:19:17,789
- Who is it?
- Some stranger.

820
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:24,494
What's all this, Father?

821
01:19:24,663 --> 01:19:27,460
Father! Answer me!

822
01:19:33,737 --> 01:19:38,468
You've started drinking again,
haven't you?

823
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:44,434
You too.

824
01:19:52,017 --> 01:19:54,007
You're impossible.

825
01:19:57,788 --> 01:20:00,654
What happened?
Where did he drink so much?

826
01:20:00,824 --> 01:20:03,849
How should I know?

827
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:07,059
He used to drink all the time.

828
01:20:07,228 --> 01:20:11,994
Used to come home dead drunk,
upsetting Mama.

829
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:14,258
We hated it.

830
01:20:14,433 --> 01:20:16,731
But he stopped drinking
after Kyoko was born.

831
01:20:16,936 --> 01:20:20,803
He was like a new man,
and I thought that was great.

832
01:20:21,206 --> 01:20:23,173
Now he's started again.

833
01:20:30,779 --> 01:20:33,043
What shall we do?

834
01:20:33,215 --> 01:20:38,412
I didn't expect him back here tonight,
let alone with company!

835
01:20:47,992 --> 01:20:51,188
We can't leave them there.

836
01:20:51,528 --> 01:20:53,586
It can't be helped.

837
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:57,527
Let's have Kiyo come down
and we'll put them upstairs.

838
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,630
They're too drunk to make it.

839
01:21:01,835 --> 01:21:03,359
What will we do, then?

840
01:21:05,038 --> 01:21:06,903
What a mess.

841
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:12,001
You sleep upstairs.
I'll put them here.

842
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:18,511
What a bother.

843
01:21:19,382 --> 01:21:22,145
Why didn't he tell me
he was coming back?

844
01:21:23,886 --> 01:21:26,376
So late and so drunk!

845
01:21:28,289 --> 01:21:30,449
I hate drunkards.

846
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,922
With a stranger, too.

847
01:21:34,427 --> 01:21:37,918
Oh, this is disturbing.

848
01:22:25,331 --> 01:22:27,265
Thank you for putting me up.

849
01:22:27,433 --> 01:22:30,731
I'm sory this place is such a mess.

850
01:22:33,137 --> 01:22:37,835
Won't you be late for work?

851
01:22:38,808 --> 01:22:41,435
No, I have quite enough time.

852
01:22:52,518 --> 01:22:55,452
- Mother?
- What is it?

853
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:59,181
I want you to accept this.

854
01:23:01,892 --> 01:23:03,950
Though it's not much.

855
01:23:04,127 --> 01:23:05,992
What is it?

856
01:23:06,162 --> 01:23:09,562
A little spending money.

857
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:12,198
Oh, no.

858
01:23:12,366 --> 01:23:15,130
Please, Mother!

859
01:23:16,836 --> 01:23:18,167
Come, Mother!

860
01:23:18,338 --> 01:23:20,430
You can't do this.

861
01:23:22,775 --> 01:23:25,436
It's I who should give you something.

862
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:29,238
Please take it, Mother.

863
01:23:29,413 --> 01:23:31,039
Please.

864
01:23:31,914 --> 01:23:33,404
Must I?

865
01:23:33,582 --> 01:23:38,484
Then thank you vey much, dear.

866
01:23:41,322 --> 01:23:44,950
You must need money for yourself,

867
01:23:45,124 --> 01:23:47,318
but still you do this.

868
01:23:47,492 --> 01:23:50,689
I don't know how to say it...

869
01:23:52,697 --> 01:23:54,857
but thank you so much.

870
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:57,124
Thank you.

871
01:23:57,934 --> 01:24:00,800
Let's be going.

872
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:09,806
If you come up
to Tokyo again, Mother,

873
01:24:09,976 --> 01:24:11,670
please come visit again.

874
01:24:14,746 --> 01:24:18,977
But I'm afraid
I won't be coming back.

875
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,774
I know you're busy,

876
01:24:22,952 --> 01:24:26,614
but do ty to come to Onomichi.

877
01:24:27,389 --> 01:24:31,620
I'd really like to,
if it were a bit nearer.

878
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:36,228
You're right.
It's so far away.

879
01:24:59,747 --> 01:25:02,510
Mother, are these yours?

880
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:06,583
Thank you.
I've gotten so forgetful.

881
01:25:11,822 --> 01:25:13,789
Let's go.

882
01:26:18,705 --> 01:26:20,468
Will they get seats?

883
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:24,969
Yes, we're in a good position here.

884
01:26:26,445 --> 01:26:30,278
The train should be in Nagoya
or Gifu around morning.

885
01:26:32,216 --> 01:26:33,546
And arrive in Onomichi?

886
01:26:33,716 --> 01:26:35,445
1:35 tomorrow afternoon.

887
01:26:35,618 --> 01:26:39,519
Have you wired Kyoko?

888
01:26:39,688 --> 01:26:41,245
I have.

889
01:26:41,422 --> 01:26:44,050
Keizo will meet you at Osaka, too.

890
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:49,560
I hope Mother will have
a good sleep on the train.

891
01:26:50,029 --> 01:26:52,929
She always sleeps well anywhere.

892
01:26:53,097 --> 01:26:56,862
Even if I don't,
I'll be home tomorrow afternoon.

893
01:26:57,568 --> 01:27:00,627
Don't drink too much, Father.

894
01:27:01,804 --> 01:27:05,364
Last night was an exception.
A reunion, you know.

895
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,667
Has the headache gone?

896
01:27:08,843 --> 01:27:11,311
Completely.

897
01:27:12,278 --> 01:27:14,576
Let this be a warning.

898
01:27:16,048 --> 01:27:19,040
I'm sure it was a good lesson.

899
01:27:19,951 --> 01:27:24,478
You've been vey kind to us - all of you.
We enjoyed our trip.

900
01:27:24,654 --> 01:27:28,851
You were so nice to us, children.

901
01:27:29,558 --> 01:27:32,617
Now that we've seen you all,
you need not come down,

902
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:37,594
even if anything should happen
to either one of us.

903
01:27:37,764 --> 01:27:40,527
Don't talk like that.

904
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,395
This isn't a farewell.

905
01:27:43,635 --> 01:27:44,727
I mean it.

906
01:27:44,903 --> 01:27:48,030
We live too far away.

907
01:28:43,446 --> 01:28:45,505
I'm sory about yesterday.

908
01:28:51,219 --> 01:28:54,813
- I heard your parents came.
- Yes. What a mess.

909
01:28:54,988 --> 01:28:59,048
They weren't supposed to get
off the train, but Mother became ill.

910
01:28:59,225 --> 01:29:01,056
What was the trouble?

911
01:29:01,227 --> 01:29:04,593
She says she feels sick around here.

912
01:29:04,763 --> 01:29:06,025
Is it her heart?

913
01:29:06,197 --> 01:29:10,257
Travel sickness. She hadn't
taken the train for a long time.

914
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:13,896
What a bother.

915
01:29:14,203 --> 01:29:17,467
Had to borrow blankets
and send for the doctor twice.

916
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:19,333
What a mess.

917
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,307
How is she now?

918
01:29:21,475 --> 01:29:24,272
Feeling fiine this morning.

919
01:29:24,444 --> 01:29:25,934
How old is she?

920
01:29:26,112 --> 01:29:28,238
Let me see.

921
01:29:28,414 --> 01:29:33,180
She's way over 60.
Sixty-seven or 68, maybe.

922
01:29:34,052 --> 01:29:37,714
Vey old.
Take good care of her.

923
01:29:38,154 --> 01:29:40,748
"Be a good son
while your parents are alive."

924
01:29:40,923 --> 01:29:43,083
That's right.

925
01:29:43,325 --> 01:29:47,317
"None can serve his parents
beyond the grave."

926
01:30:03,673 --> 01:30:06,903
It must have been because
the train was so crowded.

927
01:30:09,911 --> 01:30:10,900
Feel better?

928
01:30:11,079 --> 01:30:13,842
Thanks. I feel fiine.

929
01:30:21,686 --> 01:30:24,621
I'll be able to leave tonight.

930
01:30:25,923 --> 01:30:30,985
We could stay here one more night
and take a less crowded train.

931
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:37,458
Kyoko must be worried about us.

932
01:30:39,433 --> 01:30:45,301
But we're here in Osaka, seeing Keizo.

933
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:50,130
In ten days
we've seen all our children.

934
01:30:52,644 --> 01:30:55,578
Grown-up grandchildren, too.

935
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,440
Some grandparents seem to like their
grandchildren more than their children.

936
01:31:00,549 --> 01:31:02,243
What do you think?

937
01:31:03,385 --> 01:31:04,852
What about you?

938
01:31:05,686 --> 01:31:08,314
I like my children better.

939
01:31:10,356 --> 01:31:14,291
But I'm surprised
how children change.

940
01:31:15,293 --> 01:31:19,524
Shige used to be much nicer before.

941
01:31:21,865 --> 01:31:25,129
A married daughter
is like a stranger.

942
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,359
Koichi has changed too.

943
01:31:27,536 --> 01:31:30,402
He used to be such a nice boy.

944
01:31:30,571 --> 01:31:33,630
Children don't live up
to their parents' expectations.

945
01:31:35,742 --> 01:31:39,768
Let's just be happy
that they're better than most.

946
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:44,374
They're certainly
better than average.

947
01:31:44,548 --> 01:31:46,948
We're fortunate.

948
01:31:47,117 --> 01:31:49,050
I think so.

949
01:31:49,786 --> 01:31:52,549
We should consider ourselves lucky.

950
01:31:52,721 --> 01:31:56,122
Yes, we are vey lucky.

951
01:32:27,914 --> 01:32:30,712
Papa and Mama
had to get off at Osaka.

952
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:33,145
Is that so?

953
01:32:38,355 --> 01:32:42,484
She became sick on the train,

954
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:45,919
and they got home on the 10th.

955
01:32:53,133 --> 01:32:54,998
Is she all right?

956
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,897
I think so.
They wrote many thanks.

957
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,003
She was tired.

958
01:33:00,171 --> 01:33:04,300
Yes, the trip was too much for her.

959
01:33:05,576 --> 01:33:07,066
Was she satisfiied?

960
01:33:07,243 --> 01:33:09,143
Why wouldn't she be?

961
01:33:09,312 --> 01:33:12,144
She saw lots of places.
Atami, too.

962
01:33:14,416 --> 01:33:17,077
She'll talk about Tokyo
for a long while.

963
01:33:29,393 --> 01:33:30,917
Speaking.

964
01:33:33,163 --> 01:33:34,721
A telegram?

965
01:33:35,498 --> 01:33:37,329
No, not yet.

966
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,399
From Onomichi.

967
01:33:39,567 --> 01:33:42,035
It's so odd.

968
01:33:42,737 --> 01:33:45,296
It says Mama is dying.

969
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:54,005
How strange.
I just got Father's letter.

970
01:33:55,813 --> 01:33:59,714
It says they stopped off at Osaka
because Mother felt sick.

971
01:33:59,883 --> 01:34:03,249
They got home on the 10th.

972
01:34:09,991 --> 01:34:11,423
Te<i>l</i>egra<i>m</i>.

973
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:13,149
Just hold the line.

974
01:34:26,936 --> 01:34:28,961
- From Onomichi.
- Read it.

975
01:34:32,274 --> 01:34:34,332
"Mother critically ill - Kyoko."

976
01:34:39,312 --> 01:34:42,144
The telegram just arrived.

977
01:34:42,314 --> 01:34:44,544
You just got one too?

978
01:34:48,486 --> 01:34:50,749
I'll come over.

979
01:34:52,656 --> 01:34:53,748
See you soon.

980
01:34:54,824 --> 01:34:56,382
I'll be waiting.

981
01:34:57,693 --> 01:35:00,024
How did it happen so suddenly?

982
01:35:05,832 --> 01:35:07,993
Is it serious?

983
01:35:09,535 --> 01:35:11,365
Should I tell Noriko?

984
01:35:11,536 --> 01:35:13,901
Yes, please do.

985
01:36:01,073 --> 01:36:03,769
Yoneyama Trading Company.

986
01:36:04,076 --> 01:36:06,373
Hold the line, please.

987
01:36:11,448 --> 01:36:12,745
It's for you.

988
01:36:14,016 --> 01:36:15,574
For me?

989
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:27,357
Hello?

990
01:36:28,394 --> 01:36:30,384
Oh, hi.

991
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:34,260
Mother?

992
01:36:40,602 --> 01:36:42,092
Is that right?

993
01:37:41,748 --> 01:37:43,578
What does it mean?

994
01:37:43,749 --> 01:37:46,240
I could see Father falling ill,

995
01:37:47,186 --> 01:37:49,653
but it's Mother.

996
01:37:50,755 --> 01:37:52,119
Vey bad?

997
01:37:53,857 --> 01:37:56,950
I think so,
because it says "critically ill."

998
01:37:57,126 --> 01:37:58,957
I guess we have to go then.

999
01:38:02,097 --> 01:38:04,690
I felt strange at the station.

1000
01:38:04,865 --> 01:38:07,765
She said, "If anything should happen -"

1001
01:38:09,002 --> 01:38:13,131
She must have had a bad feeling,
somehow or other.

1002
01:38:14,606 --> 01:38:16,163
We've got to go, anyway.

1003
01:38:16,341 --> 01:38:19,741
Since she is critically ill.

1004
01:38:20,177 --> 01:38:22,873
If we're going, we better hury.
We'll take the express.

1005
01:38:23,612 --> 01:38:29,481
Yes, but I have to make all kinds
of arrangements before I leave.

1006
01:38:29,651 --> 01:38:31,845
Me, too.

1007
01:38:32,019 --> 01:38:34,681
At this busy time, too.

1008
01:38:49,532 --> 01:38:50,998
Come in.

1009
01:38:53,302 --> 01:38:56,998
Can you bring a bandage?

1010
01:39:03,175 --> 01:39:05,507
Let's leave tonight.

1011
01:39:05,678 --> 01:39:09,704
Might as well, if we have to go.
See you later.

1012
01:39:18,353 --> 01:39:20,947
What about mourning clothes?

1013
01:39:23,858 --> 01:39:25,689
We might need them.

1014
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:31,194
Let's take them,
but I hope we don't need to use them.

1015
01:39:32,197 --> 01:39:35,359
I'll meet you at the station.

1016
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:29,762
I'm going to meet them.

1017
01:40:31,508 --> 01:40:34,305
That's vey good of you.

1018
01:41:42,795 --> 01:41:45,319
What's the matter?

1019
01:41:48,432 --> 01:41:49,990
Is it too hot?

1020
01:41:52,035 --> 01:41:55,526
The children are coming to see you.

1021
01:41:55,705 --> 01:41:58,070
Kyoko's gone to meet them.

1022
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:01,470
They'll be here any moment.

1023
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:26,627
You'll get well.

1024
01:42:27,228 --> 01:42:31,890
You'll get well.
I'm sure you will.

1025
01:43:22,636 --> 01:43:27,503
Her blood pressure went down.
She's still in a coma.

1026
01:43:28,006 --> 01:43:29,803
Really?

1027
01:43:42,518 --> 01:43:44,712
Her reaction's weak.

1028
01:43:47,321 --> 01:43:49,221
I'll come again.

1029
01:44:25,183 --> 01:44:28,515
Where's Keizo? He's so late.

1030
01:44:33,656 --> 01:44:35,316
Did he answer the telegram?

1031
01:44:36,324 --> 01:44:38,086
Not a word.

1032
01:44:43,162 --> 01:44:46,130
But he lives the closest of all.

1033
01:44:50,801 --> 01:44:53,133
Father.

1034
01:44:54,137 --> 01:44:55,695
You too.

1035
01:45:13,486 --> 01:45:17,387
Father, I don't like her condition.

1036
01:45:27,229 --> 01:45:28,696
What do you mean?

1037
01:45:29,964 --> 01:45:32,762
I mean it's dangerous.

1038
01:45:34,167 --> 01:45:38,330
It's not a good sign
that she's still in a coma.

1039
01:45:40,406 --> 01:45:43,932
Did the trip to Tokyo cause this?

1040
01:45:44,108 --> 01:45:45,438
I don't think so.

1041
01:45:45,609 --> 01:45:49,044
She was so lively in Tokyo.
Wasn't she?

1042
01:45:52,181 --> 01:45:56,014
- It might have been one of the causes.
- What is it, then?

1043
01:45:57,685 --> 01:46:00,051
She may not live till tomorrow.

1044
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:02,050
Tomorrow?

1045
01:46:04,023 --> 01:46:06,786
Probably happen around daybreak.

1046
01:46:07,426 --> 01:46:09,154
So.

1047
01:46:09,627 --> 01:46:11,891
She's not going to live.

1048
01:46:17,733 --> 01:46:21,532
Mother's around 68, isn't she?

1049
01:46:23,838 --> 01:46:25,395
So.

1050
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:27,839
She's not going to live.

1051
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:31,032
I don't think so.

1052
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:34,202
So.

1053
01:46:35,647 --> 01:46:37,876
This is the end.

1054
01:46:40,217 --> 01:46:42,184
That's all.

1055
01:47:10,706 --> 01:47:13,606
Then Keizo won't be in time, will he?

1056
01:48:52,549 --> 01:48:55,608
Isn't life too short, though?

1057
01:48:57,486 --> 01:49:00,079
She was so lively.

1058
01:49:01,389 --> 01:49:04,016
She must've had a feeling
this would happen soon.

1059
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,149
Yes, perhaps.

1060
01:49:11,763 --> 01:49:14,629
Still, I'm glad she came to Tokyo.

1061
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:18,263
We were able to see her alive.

1062
01:49:19,635 --> 01:49:21,603
We talked about many things.

1063
01:49:23,071 --> 01:49:25,005
Did you bring mourning clothes?

1064
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:31,002
You should have brought some.

1065
01:49:31,411 --> 01:49:32,571
And you, Kyoko?

1066
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:35,537
I don't have any either.

1067
01:49:35,714 --> 01:49:38,079
You'll have to borrow some.

1068
01:49:38,249 --> 01:49:40,308
Borrow some for Noriko too.

1069
01:49:48,324 --> 01:49:54,192
She died peacefully,
without suffering, and full of years.

1070
01:49:57,331 --> 01:49:59,423
Isn't that Keizo?

1071
01:50:08,539 --> 01:50:09,698
How is she?

1072
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:23,108
I wasn't in time.

1073
01:50:24,885 --> 01:50:26,875
I was afraid of that.

1074
01:50:40,363 --> 01:50:43,422
I was out of town
on offiicial business.

1075
01:50:43,965 --> 01:50:46,023
I'm sory I'm late.

1076
01:50:47,434 --> 01:50:50,027
The telegram came while I was away.

1077
01:50:52,539 --> 01:50:55,029
This is a terrible thing.

1078
01:50:55,374 --> 01:50:56,602
When was it?

1079
01:50:58,142 --> 01:51:01,907
This morning at 3:15.

1080
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:09,379
If I had taken the 8:40 train,
I would've been in time.

1081
01:51:10,451 --> 01:51:13,385
Keizo, look at her.

1082
01:51:14,054 --> 01:51:15,919
See how peaceful she is.

1083
01:51:51,182 --> 01:51:53,445
Forgive my delay.

1084
01:52:04,425 --> 01:52:06,154
Where is Father?

1085
01:52:07,261 --> 01:52:08,955
Where, I wonder.

1086
01:52:46,023 --> 01:52:48,183
Keizo has just come, Father.

1087
01:52:50,927 --> 01:52:54,020
It was such a beautiful dawn.

1088
01:52:58,199 --> 01:53:01,395
I'm afraid we'll have
another hot day today.

1089
01:55:28,144 --> 01:55:29,633
What's the matter?

1090
01:55:30,612 --> 01:55:32,739
I can't stand that sound.

1091
01:55:34,381 --> 01:55:35,609
What do you mean?

1092
01:55:36,650 --> 01:55:41,915
As I hear it, I feel as if Mother
were becoming smaller, bit by bit.

1093
01:55:43,489 --> 01:55:45,956
I wasn't a vey good son.

1094
01:55:51,128 --> 01:55:55,257
It's time we started offering incense.

1095
01:55:57,499 --> 01:55:59,763
I can't lose her now.

1096
01:55:59,934 --> 01:56:03,266
No one can serve his parents
beyond the grave.

1097
01:56:45,968 --> 01:56:49,630
We once saw fiireworks from here,
didn't we?

1098
01:56:49,805 --> 01:56:51,932
Oh, did we?

1099
01:56:52,106 --> 01:56:54,802
On the night of the town festival.

1100
01:56:54,975 --> 01:56:56,066
Remember?

1101
01:56:56,242 --> 01:56:57,641
No, I don't.

1102
01:56:57,811 --> 01:57:02,645
You were so excited,
but after sundown you fell asleep.

1103
01:57:02,815 --> 01:57:05,510
With your head on Mother's lap.

1104
01:57:05,683 --> 01:57:07,514
I don't remember.

1105
01:57:09,519 --> 01:57:11,850
What were you doing in those days?

1106
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:16,386
Head of the city's
board of education, I believe.

1107
01:57:16,558 --> 01:57:19,686
A long time ago, wasn't it?

1108
01:57:20,828 --> 01:57:23,490
Once we went to Omishima
during the spring holidays.

1109
01:57:23,664 --> 01:57:26,564
That I remember.

1110
01:57:26,899 --> 01:57:28,490
Mama got seasick.

1111
01:57:29,401 --> 01:57:32,528
Yes, I remember that too.

1112
01:57:33,971 --> 01:57:36,234
She was so full of life then.

1113
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:40,005
How old was she then?

1114
01:57:41,677 --> 01:57:44,509
Forty-two or 43, I believe.

1115
01:57:44,679 --> 01:57:47,579
Take good care of yourself, Father,

1116
01:57:48,248 --> 01:57:50,716
and live long.

1117
01:57:50,917 --> 01:57:52,508
Thank you.

1118
01:58:23,941 --> 01:58:27,603
It may sound heartless to say so,

1119
01:58:27,777 --> 01:58:30,746
but I rather wish he had died fiirst.

1120
01:58:33,048 --> 01:58:35,982
If Kyoko marries,
he'll be left all alone.

1121
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:39,276
I guess so.

1122
01:58:39,887 --> 01:58:43,219
We could have looked
after Mother in Tokyo.

1123
01:58:44,090 --> 01:58:49,288
Kyoko, did Mother
still have her gray summer sash?

1124
01:58:49,828 --> 01:58:52,728
I'd like it for a keepsake.
Is that all right with you?

1125
01:58:57,233 --> 01:58:59,860
And that linen kimono
she used to wear in summer?

1126
01:59:00,469 --> 01:59:03,494
I want that too.
You know where it is?

1127
01:59:03,671 --> 01:59:05,332
Can you get it out?

1128
01:59:18,215 --> 01:59:21,776
It's all over now.

1129
01:59:22,752 --> 01:59:24,982
You've been kind to come

1130
01:59:25,154 --> 01:59:28,850
and give your time
so we could mourn her.

1131
01:59:29,658 --> 01:59:31,249
Thank you.

1132
01:59:38,463 --> 01:59:40,658
She would have been pleased

1133
01:59:40,832 --> 01:59:43,265
to know Koichi looked after her.

1134
01:59:43,501 --> 01:59:47,061
I didn't do anything.

1135
01:59:48,138 --> 01:59:54,439
I remember when we had gone
to Atami from Tokyo.

1136
01:59:54,609 --> 01:59:58,510
She had felt dizzy once.

1137
02:00:02,915 --> 02:00:05,383
It didn't seem that serious.

1138
02:00:06,885 --> 02:00:09,149
Why didn't you tell us?

1139
02:00:09,321 --> 02:00:11,845
Or at least Koichi?

1140
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:15,482
I guess I should have.

1141
02:00:17,226 --> 02:00:20,194
But that wasn't the cause.

1142
02:00:20,362 --> 02:00:23,626
She was overweight,
so the illness came on suddenly.

1143
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:29,767
It's just like a dream.

1144
02:00:30,336 --> 02:00:31,735
When are you leaving?

1145
02:00:33,404 --> 02:00:35,065
I can't stay long.

1146
02:00:35,239 --> 02:00:38,674
Me neither.
How about the night express?

1147
02:00:40,344 --> 02:00:41,810
What about you, Keizo?

1148
02:00:41,978 --> 02:00:43,707
I can stay.

1149
02:00:45,347 --> 02:00:47,372
- So we'll leave tonight?
- Yes.

1150
02:00:47,816 --> 02:00:51,410
Noriko, you'll stay with Father
a bit longer, won't you?

1151
02:00:52,019 --> 02:00:54,213
You could leave with them.

1152
02:00:54,387 --> 02:00:56,218
I might as well go.

1153
02:00:56,389 --> 02:00:58,856
I have to make a report.

1154
02:00:59,024 --> 02:01:01,821
And there's that baseball match, too.

1155
02:01:01,993 --> 02:01:05,928
That busy?
Well, thanks for coming.

1156
02:01:06,096 --> 02:01:08,962
You'll be lonely now.

1157
02:01:09,131 --> 02:01:11,599
I'll get used to it.

1158
02:01:12,201 --> 02:01:14,225
A bit more rice.

1159
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:19,166
Get the train tickets for us, will you?

1160
02:01:19,606 --> 02:01:21,163
Rice for me, too.

1161
02:01:26,311 --> 02:01:28,336
Can we get seats?

1162
02:01:51,397 --> 02:01:54,593
Papa, don't drink too much, please.

1163
02:01:54,766 --> 02:01:57,325
Don't you wory.

1164
02:02:04,072 --> 02:02:07,973
So, you'll all be going home.

1165
02:03:05,585 --> 02:03:07,313
Here's your lunch.

1166
02:03:11,022 --> 02:03:13,650
Thank you for eveything.

1167
02:03:14,192 --> 02:03:17,456
Come up to Tokyo on your vacation.

1168
02:03:17,627 --> 02:03:20,026
Must you go home today?

1169
02:03:20,196 --> 02:03:22,061
Yes, I must.

1170
02:03:24,833 --> 02:03:26,959
I'm sory I can't see you off
at the station.

1171
02:03:27,134 --> 02:03:28,692
That's all right.

1172
02:03:29,436 --> 02:03:32,131
Be sure to come to Tokyo.

1173
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:38,768
I'm so glad you stayed.

1174
02:03:39,677 --> 02:03:43,612
I think they should have stayed
a bit longer.

1175
02:03:44,347 --> 02:03:46,315
But they're busy.

1176
02:03:46,483 --> 02:03:48,882
They're selfiish.

1177
02:03:49,485 --> 02:03:52,749
Demanding things
and leaving like this.

1178
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:56,377
They have their own affairs.

1179
02:03:58,091 --> 02:04:00,581
You have yours too.

1180
02:04:00,759 --> 02:04:02,124
They're selfiish.

1181
02:04:03,194 --> 02:04:04,889
But Kyoko...

1182
02:04:06,697 --> 02:04:10,530
Wanting her clothes
right after her death.

1183
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:15,465
I felt so sory for poor Mother.

1184
02:04:16,037 --> 02:04:20,735
Even strangers would have been
more considerate.

1185
02:04:23,009 --> 02:04:24,909
But look, Kyoko.

1186
02:04:25,078 --> 02:04:28,012
At your age I thought so too.

1187
02:04:28,747 --> 02:04:34,047
But children do drift away
from their parents.

1188
02:04:35,819 --> 02:04:39,845
A woman has her own life,
apart from her parents,

1189
02:04:40,022 --> 02:04:42,751
when she becomes Shige's age.

1190
02:04:43,992 --> 02:04:48,155
So she meant no harm, I'm sure.

1191
02:04:49,196 --> 02:04:53,393
They have to look after
their own lives.

1192
02:04:54,199 --> 02:04:55,962
I wonder.

1193
02:04:56,468 --> 02:04:58,560
I won't ever be like that.

1194
02:04:58,736 --> 02:05:01,034
Then what's the point
of being family?

1195
02:05:01,971 --> 02:05:03,529
It is.

1196
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:07,238
But children become like that

1197
02:05:07,743 --> 02:05:09,335
gradually.

1198
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:11,273
Then -you, too?

1199
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:16,571
I may become like that,
in spite of myself.

1200
02:05:18,184 --> 02:05:20,948
Isn't life disappointing?

1201
02:05:21,553 --> 02:05:24,545
Yes, it is.

1202
02:05:30,092 --> 02:05:32,083
I must get going.

1203
02:05:32,261 --> 02:05:35,229
Good-bye, then.

1204
02:05:35,397 --> 02:05:38,229
Father, I'm leaving now.

1205
02:05:45,437 --> 02:05:48,133
Take care of yourself.

1206
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:51,240
Thank you. Good-bye.

1207
02:05:51,709 --> 02:05:54,438
Please come to Tokyo
on your vacation.

1208
02:05:56,680 --> 02:05:58,943
Good-bye.

1209
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:58,655
Has she gone?

1210
02:07:04,363 --> 02:07:09,265
Father, I'm leaving
on the afternoon train.

1211
02:07:09,433 --> 02:07:11,458
You are?

1212
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:15,101
Thank you for eveything.

1213
02:07:15,272 --> 02:07:17,739
Please, I didn't do anything.

1214
02:07:17,906 --> 02:07:20,840
You've been a great help.

1215
02:07:24,945 --> 02:07:29,608
Mother told me
how kind you were to her

1216
02:07:29,782 --> 02:07:32,045
when she stayed at your place.

1217
02:07:34,085 --> 02:07:36,518
I didn't have much to offer.

1218
02:07:37,688 --> 02:07:39,450
She meant it.

1219
02:07:39,622 --> 02:07:43,183
She told me it was
her happiest time in Tokyo.

1220
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:46,850
I want to thank you too.

1221
02:07:55,001 --> 02:07:57,468
She was so worried

1222
02:07:57,770 --> 02:08:00,465
about your future.

1223
02:08:00,672 --> 02:08:03,367
You can't go on like this.

1224
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:05,303
Don't wory about me.

1225
02:08:05,475 --> 02:08:08,739
I want to see you married
as soon as possible.

1226
02:08:10,446 --> 02:08:14,040
Forget about Shoji.
He's dead.

1227
02:08:15,115 --> 02:08:21,815
It hurts me to see you
go on living like this.

1228
02:08:23,121 --> 02:08:26,249
No, it's not like that.

1229
02:08:26,425 --> 02:08:27,982
I mean it.

1230
02:08:28,159 --> 02:08:32,993
She said she'd never seen
a nicer woman than you.

1231
02:08:34,230 --> 02:08:37,926
She overestimated me.

1232
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:40,499
You're wrong, Noriko.

1233
02:08:40,668 --> 02:08:46,230
She did. I'm not the nice woman
she thought I was.

1234
02:08:46,972 --> 02:08:49,702
If you see me like that,

1235
02:08:49,875 --> 02:08:52,934
it embarrasses me.

1236
02:08:53,111 --> 02:08:55,544
No, it shouldn't.

1237
02:08:55,713 --> 02:08:59,239
Really, I'm quite selfiish.

1238
02:09:00,183 --> 02:09:03,879
I'm not always thinking of your son,

1239
02:09:04,052 --> 02:09:06,952
though you think I am.

1240
02:09:07,722 --> 02:09:10,713
I'll be happy if you forget him.

1241
02:09:10,890 --> 02:09:17,453
Often I don't think of him for days.

1242
02:09:20,064 --> 02:09:24,659
Sometimes I feel
I can't go on like this forever.

1243
02:09:25,369 --> 02:09:29,498
Often I wonder,
when I can't sleep,

1244
02:09:29,672 --> 02:09:32,936
what will become of me
if I stay this way.

1245
02:09:33,108 --> 02:09:35,405
Day passes and night comes,
yet nothing happens,

1246
02:09:35,509 --> 02:09:37,636
and I feel a kind of loneliness.

1247
02:09:38,511 --> 02:09:42,344
My heart seems to be waiting
for something.

1248
02:09:44,816 --> 02:09:45,907
I'm selfiish.

1249
02:09:46,083 --> 02:09:48,244
You are not.

1250
02:09:48,419 --> 02:09:50,386
Yes, I am.

1251
02:09:51,554 --> 02:09:54,989
But I couldn't say this to Mother.

1252
02:09:56,091 --> 02:09:57,819
That's all right.

1253
02:09:57,992 --> 02:10:01,722
You are truly a good woman.
An honest woman.

1254
02:10:04,097 --> 02:10:05,791
Not at all.

1255
02:10:32,952 --> 02:10:36,011
This watch belonged to her.

1256
02:10:36,221 --> 02:10:39,018
It's old-fashioned, I believe,

1257
02:10:39,190 --> 02:10:43,148
but she used it
since she was your age.

1258
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:45,623
Take it for her sake.

1259
02:10:46,662 --> 02:10:49,255
Please take it.

1260
02:10:51,733 --> 02:10:55,828
I'm sure she'd be happy
if you'd use it.

1261
02:10:56,437 --> 02:10:59,405
For her sake, please.

1262
02:10:59,939 --> 02:11:01,633
Thank you.

1263
02:11:06,243 --> 02:11:11,737
Please believe me,
I want you to be happy.

1264
02:11:11,915 --> 02:11:14,041
Sincerely.

1265
02:11:14,716 --> 02:11:15,944
I mean it.

1266
02:11:28,660 --> 02:11:30,457
It's strange.

1267
02:11:30,628 --> 02:11:33,118
We have children of our own,

1268
02:11:33,297 --> 02:11:35,857
yet you've done the most for us,

1269
02:11:36,033 --> 02:11:39,331
and you're not even a blood relative.

1270
02:11:39,702 --> 02:11:41,794
Thank you.

1271
02:14:10,114 --> 02:14:14,015
You're going to be lonely
with them all gone.

1272
02:14:14,617 --> 02:14:17,279
It was really so sudden.

1273
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:20,485
She was a headstrong woman,

1274
02:14:20,655 --> 02:14:23,214
but if I had known things
would come to this,

1275
02:14:23,390 --> 02:14:27,485
I'd have been kinder to her
while she was alive.

1276
02:14:29,095 --> 02:14:32,552
Living alone, I feel
the days will get vey long.

1277
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:34,197
Lonely.

1278
02:14:34,365 --> 02:14:36,959
You will be lonely.
