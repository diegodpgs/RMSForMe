1
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,165
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...
And Spring

2
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,770
Spring

3
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,904
Wake up

4
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,692
- Master!
- Yes, my boy?

5
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,899
Where do you want to go?

6
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,935
l want to pick herbs for medicine

7
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,236
Then let us go.
Come along

8
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,500
l'm going to pick herbs now, Master

9
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,298
Watch out for snakes

10
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,157
- Wait for me, Master
- Yes

11
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,039
l've picked a lot of herbs, Master

12
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,207
Really? You've picked a lot?

13
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,915
Careful!

14
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,268
Stop! Throw this away, my child

15
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,838
Why? lt looks the same

16
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,710
Even though it looks the same,
this is a deadly plant

17
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,012
The other one can save lives

18
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,180
lt still looks the same.
How can l know?

19
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:50,428
Look closely. Here at the tip
you can see a white line

20
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,790
lf you ate this plant, you'd die

21
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,325
You mustn't pick
this sort of plant next time

22
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,403
- ls this one alright to eat?
- Yes, this one is good

23
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,995
Master, there is a stone on my back.
Please take it off

24
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,903
- Does it torment you?
- Yes, Master

25
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,569
Didn't you also do it to the fish?

26
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,581
Yes, Master

27
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,048
Didn't you also do it to the frog?

28
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,913
Yes, Master

29
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,383
Didn't you also do it to the snake?

30
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,391
Yes, Master

31
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,051
Stand up!

32
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,760
Walk around!

33
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,308
l can't walk, it's too heavy

34
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,514
How do you think the fish,
the frog and the snake endured it?

35
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,315
lt was wrong to do it

36
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,617
Go and find all the animals
and release them from the stones

37
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,089
Then l will release you too

38
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:07,332
But if any of the animals, the fish,
the frog or the snake is dead,

39
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:14,164
you will carry the stone in your heart
for the rest of your life

40
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:10,262
Summer

41
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,525
You look so very healthy

42
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:35,729
This tree is over 300 years old

43
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,339
You will become
as healthy as this tree

44
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,872
Greetings

45
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,943
Come in

46
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,932
Will she recover, wise one?

47
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,361
l believe that her soul is suffering

48
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,340
When she finds peace in her soul,
her body will return to health

49
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,008
Please take care of her!

50
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,544
Excuse me

51
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,383
You are not allowed to sit on that

52
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,786
The master will be angry with you

53
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,402
Why are you praying all of a sudden?

54
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,572
Would you like to come along?

55
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:19,570
Softly!
lt must prepared with a true heart

56
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,453
Drink!

57
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,426
lt will clear your head

58
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,986
The boat is floating away!

59
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,978
Stop it!

60
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,670
Stop it!

61
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,102
Have you recovered now?

62
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,767
Yes, l have completely recovered

63
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,738
Strange

64
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,805
When l can't see you,
l go insane

65
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,146
What is wrong with me?

66
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,140
Cold! lt's cold!

67
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,646
What shall l do?

68
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,692
l did wrong, Master.
Forgive me

69
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:15,929
That happens by itself.
lt is just nature

70
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:21,768
Are you still sick?

71
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,036
No

72
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,340
Then it was the right medicine

73
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,947
Now that you have recovered,
you can leave this place

74
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,313
No, Master! She can't!

75
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:44,427
Lust awakens the desire to possess.
And that awakens the intent to murder

76
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,763
Get in

77
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:27,509
Fall

78
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:45,300
That was tiring, huh?

79
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:28,541
MAN, 30, FLEES AFTER MURDERlNG WlFE

80
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:54,679
You have grown a lot!

81
00:55:55,984 --> 00:55:57,542
Get in!

82
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:58,972
So? Have you led
a happy life up till now?

83
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:02,573
Tell me something
interesting about your life

84
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,556
The world of men has grown
agonizing for you, hasn't it?

85
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,889
Leave alone, Master.
Can you not see that l am suffering?

86
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,960
What causes you to suffer?

87
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:16,623
My only sin was to love

88
00:57:16,865 --> 00:57:19,163
l wanted nothing except her

89
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:21,401
So?

90
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,064
She went with another man

91
00:57:24,172 --> 00:57:25,696
Ah, that was it

92
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:29,038
How can that be?
She said that she'd love only me

93
00:57:29,277 --> 00:57:32,576
- And then?
- l couldn't bear it any more

94
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:35,081
Didn't you know beforehand
how the world of men is?

95
00:57:35,684 --> 00:57:38,653
Sometimes we have to
let go of things we like

96
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:42,218
What you like,
others will also like!

97
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,190
But still, how could she do that?

98
00:57:44,459 --> 00:57:47,053
The bitch!

99
00:57:48,363 --> 00:57:51,491
- ls it so unbearable for you?
- Yes!

100
01:00:35,597 --> 01:00:37,497
Master!

101
01:00:40,135 --> 01:00:42,035
Master!

102
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:12,190
Young fool!

103
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:15,752
Young fool!

104
01:04:50,618 --> 01:04:55,920
Though you can so easily kill,
you yourself cannot be easily killed

105
01:04:56,591 --> 01:05:00,584
Carve out all of
these characters with the knife

106
01:05:00,962 --> 01:05:06,059
And while you cut out each one,
drive out the anger from your heart

107
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,291
Holy one!

108
01:06:16,904 --> 01:06:18,667
Holy one!

109
01:06:43,131 --> 01:06:45,793
We've come to investigate something

110
01:07:15,563 --> 01:07:17,827
- Drop the knife!
- Otherwise l'll shoot!

111
01:07:21,469 --> 01:07:24,768
What are you doing?
Continue cutting!

112
01:07:33,781 --> 01:07:36,579
Prajnaparamita Sutra.
lt helps restore inner peace

113
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:39,377
Please let him finish

114
01:07:39,487 --> 01:07:41,318
How long will it take?

115
01:07:41,756 --> 01:07:43,917
Until tomorrow morning

116
01:08:04,178 --> 01:08:06,408
- No connection
- No?

117
01:08:06,547 --> 01:08:08,378
lt's quite a deep valley, isn't it?

118
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:32,200
What?

119
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:21,129
They make white paint
from these mussels

120
01:13:30,538 --> 01:13:32,403
Stand up

121
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,769
lt's time to go

122
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,916
Detective Choi,
let's go as we are

123
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:29,656
Detective Chi,
the boat won't go forwards

124
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:40,329
Ah, now it's moving
