4
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,800
I never knew the old
Vienna before the war...

5
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,000
with its Strauss music,
its glamour and easy charm.

6
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,800
Constantinople suited me better.

7
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,300
I really got to know it in
the classic period of the black market.

8
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,300
We'd run anything if people wanted it
enough and had the money to pay.

9
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,300
Of course, a situation like that
does tempt amateurs...

10
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,100
but, well, they-

11
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,500
you know, they can't stay
the course like a professional.

12
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,800
Now the city, it's divided
into four zones, you know...

13
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,000
each occupied by a power:

14
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,600
the American, the British,
the Russian and the French.

15
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,100
But the center of the city,
that's international...

16
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,100
policed by an international patrol,
one member of each of the four powers.

17
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,800
Wonderful! What a hope they had,
all strangers to the place...

18
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,100
and none of them
could speak the same language...

19
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,400
except a sort of
smattering of German.

20
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,800
Good fellows, on the whole.
Did their best, you know.

21
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,900
Vienna doesn't really look any worse
than a lot of other European cities.

22
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000

about Holly Martins...

25
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,300
an American, came all the way
here to visit a friend of his.

The name was Lime.
Harry Lime.

27

and Lime had offered him...

happy as a lark and without a cent.

we're having a little
lecture on the contemporary novel.

160
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
- Thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
- They wouldn't know me.

161
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,600
Nonsense. Your novels are very
popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?

162
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,400
- Very popular.
- Very popular. Are you staying long?

163
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,400
How long can one stay here
on this stage money?

164
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,300
Listen, Mr. Martins,
if you'd agree to be our guest...

165
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,100
- we'd be delighted to have you.
- [Rhone Rings]

166
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,500
- Would you?
- As long as you care to stay.

167
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,000
- But he's due to leave tomorrow, sir.
- Excuse me. Have you got a toothache?

168
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,000
- Number 8, Mr. Martins.
- Come upstairs a moment.

169
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I know a very good dentist.

170
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,100
I don't need a dentist.
Somebody hit me, that's all.

171
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Goodness. We must report that.
Were they trying to rob you?

172
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh, just a soldier.

173
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,200
I was trying to punch
his major in the eye.

174
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,800
- No. A major? Were you really?
- Heard of Harry Lime?

175
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,300
I've heard of him, of course,
but I didn't exactly know him.

176
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
I was going to stay with him,
but he died Thursday.

177
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,200
Goodness, that's awkward.

178

- [Rhone Rings]

179
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,300

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
"Goodness, that's awkward"?

181
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
Mr. Martins.
Excuse me. Telephone.

182
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,900
Who is it?

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,100
- Baron Kurtz.
- Must be some mistake. Yes?

184
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,700
[Man On Phone]
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

185
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
I'd very much like to meet you, Baron.

186
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,000
Come around.

187
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,500
Austrians aren't allowed
in your hotel.

188
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,300
- Couldn't we meet at the Mozart Café?
- Where?

189
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,300
- Just around the corner.
- How will I know you?

190
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,100
I'll carry a copy of one of your books.

191
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Harry gave it to me.

192
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,300
Be there in a moment.
Wait a minute.

193
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,000
If I do this lecture business,
you'll put me up here a while?

194
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,000
- Certainly.
- It's a deal.

195
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,400
Ever read a book of mine
called "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe"?

196
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,200
No, not that one.

197
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
It's a story about
a man who hunted down

198
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,600
a sheriff who was
victimizing his best friend.

199
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,600
- Seems exciting.
- It is.

200
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,900
I'm gunning just the same way
for your Major Callaghan.

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Sounds anti-British, sir.

202
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,200
- Baron Kurtz?
- Mr. Martins?

203
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,800
Delighted to meet you.

204
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,700
Come, let's sit down here.

205

[Speaking German]

206
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,600

- Coffee.

[Speaking German]

208
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,700
It's wonderful how
you keep the tension.

209
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,400
- Tension?
- Suspense.

210
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,700
You really liked it?
what he'll be up to next.

211
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,900
At the end of every
chapter you are left guessing.

212
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,200
So, you were a friend of Harry's?

213
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,600
I think his best.
Except you, of course.

214
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,500
The police have a crazy notion that he
was mixed up in some sort of a racket.

215
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,900
Everyone in Vienna is. We all sell
cigarettes and that kind of thing.

216
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,900
I tell you, I've done things that would
have seemed unthinkable before the war.

217
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,900
Once when I was hard up,

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,900
I sold some tires on the black market.

219
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,800
I wonder what my father
would have said.

220
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,800
I'm afraid the police
meant more than that.

221
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,400
They get rather absurd ideas sometimes.

222
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,300
He's somewhere now
he won't mind about that.

223
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,800
Even so, I'm not going
to leave it at this.

224
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,800
Will you help me?

225
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
I wish I could.

226
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,500
But, you know, I am an Austrian.

227
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,700
I have to be
careful with the police.

228
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I'm afraid I can't help you.

229
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,200
Except with advice, of course.

230
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,200
Advice.

231
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,000
We came out of his place
like this...

232
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,700
and were walking this way.

233
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,900
A friend of his called to him
from over there.

234
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,700
Harry went across, and
from up there came the truck.

235
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
It was just about here.

236
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,900
- Here?
- Yes.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,600
His friend and I picked him up...

238
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,800
- carried him across over here.
- [Car Horn Honks]

239
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,200
It was a terrible thing. Terrible.

240
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,700
We laid him down just about here.

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,900
And this is where he died.

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,100
Even at the end,
his thoughts were of you.

243
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,700
What did he say?

244
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,500
I can't remember
the exact words, Holly.

245
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,600
- I may call you Holly, mayn't I?
He always called you that to us.

[Dog Whimpers]

247
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,400
He was anxious I should
look after you when you arrived...

248
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,200
to see that you got safely home,
tickets, you know, and all that.

249
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,200
But he said he died instantaneously.

250
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,600
Well, he died before
the ambulance could reach us.

251
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,500
Well, there was only you and this, uh -
this friend of his. Uh, who was he?

252
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,900
A Romanian. Mr. Ropescu.

253
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,100
- I'd like to talk to him.
- H-He has left Vienna.

- Uh, excuse me.
- Yes?

- Did you know Mr. Lime well?
- Mr. Lime? Yes.

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,800
- You remember me. U-Upstairs.
- Yes, I remember you.

Excuse me.

266

Who was at the funeral besides you?

267
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,000
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.

268
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,400
Wasn't there a girl there?

269
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,700
Some girl of the Josefstadt Theater.
You know what Harry was.

270
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,800
You oughtn't to speak to her.
It would only cause her pain.

271
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Not necessarily.
She'd probably want to help.

272
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,700
What's the good
of another postmortem?

273
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,600
Suppose you dig up something,
well, discreditable to Harry?

274
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,900
- Would you give me your address?
- I live in the Russian sector.

275
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,700
But you'll find me at
the Casanova Club every night.

- I don't know.

I don't think I ever heard it.

279
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,900
You did mention the theater.

280
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,200
Josefstadt.

281
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,700
But I still think
it won't do Harry any good.

to think of yourself.

00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,700
Someone threw me this packet last week.

315
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,200
Sometimes the British do instead of
flowers, you know, on the first night.

316
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,300
That was a bouquet from an American.
Would you rather have whiskey?

317
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,700
- Oh, tea's fine.
- Good. I wanted to sell it.

318
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,000
- Oh, there is some tea left.
- Had you known him some time?

319
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
- Yes.

I wanted to talk to you - No, thank you.

I wanted to talk to you about him.

322

There's nothing really to talk about,
is there? Nothing.

323
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Well, I saw you at the funeral.

324
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm so sorry.
I didn't notice much.

325
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,300
You were in love with him,
weren't you?

326
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know. How can you know
a thing like that afterwards?

327
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,200
I don't know anything anymore,
except I want to be dead too.

328
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,400
Some more tea?

329
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,500
No. No tea.
Would you like a cigarette?

Oh, American.
Thank you. I like them.

331
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,600
I was talking to another friend
of Harry's, a Baron Kurtz.

332
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
- Do you know him?
- No.

333
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,000
- He's got a little dog.
- Oh, yes, yes.

334
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,800
Don't understand what Harry saw
in a fellow like that.

335
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,000
That was the man who brought me
some money when Harry died.

336
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,400
He said Harry had been
anxious at the last moment.

337
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,900
Hmm.
He said he remembered me too.

338
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Seems to show
he wasn't in much pain.

339
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,300
Dr. Winkel told me that.

340
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Dr. Winkel?
Who's he?

341
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,800
A doctor Harry used to go to.
He was passing just after it happened.

342
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,200
- His own doctor?
- Yes.

343
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,700
Well, were you at the inquest?

344
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,700
Yes. They said it wasn't
the driver's fault.

345
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,700
Harry had often said what
a careful driver he was.

346
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,700
- He was Harry's driver?
- Mm-hmm.

Well, uh, I don't get it.

00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,100
- Have you proved the
policemen are wrong?

629
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,500
Not yet.

630
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
But you will.

631
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,600
Our friend Dr. Winkel
said you had called.

632
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,200
- Wasn't he helpful?
- Well, he was, uh, limited.

633
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,200
- But Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
- The Romanian?

634
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,500
- Yes, the man who helped carry him.
- I thought he'd left Vienna.

635
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
He's back now.

636
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,000
Well, I'd like to meet
all of Harry's friends.

637
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,200
I'll bring him to you.

638
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,300
Haven't you done enough for tonight?

639
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,700
The porter said three men carried
the body, and two of them are here.

640
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,700
Who are you lookin' for now?

641
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,200
Shh. Shh.
Don't. Don't. Please don't.

642
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,500
Silly lookin' bunch.

643
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
- Mr. Popescu, Mr. Martins.
- How do you do?

644
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,600
- How do you do?

645
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,500
Any friend of Harry is a friend of mine.

646
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,600
- I'll leave you together.
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.

647
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,400
- You remember me?
- Of course.

648
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,700
I helped Harry fix
her papers, Mr. Martins.

649
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,500
Oh, you did?

650
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,900
Not the sort of thing
I should confess to a stranger...

651
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,500
but you have to break
the rules sometimes.

652
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,100
Humanity is a duty.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?

653
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,800
- [Speaks German]
- Keep the pack.

654
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,400
I understand
you were with Harry-

655
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,800
Two double whiskeys.

657
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,600
It was a terrible thing. I was just
crossing the road to go to Harry.

658
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
He and the baron
were on the sidewalk.

659
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,800
Maybe if I hadn't started to cross
the road, it wouldn't have happened.

660
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,000
I can't help blaming myself
and wishing things had been different.

661
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:21,200
Anyway, he saw me and stepped
off the sidewalk to meet me.

662
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,600
And the truck-

663
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,800
It was terrible,
Mr. Martins. Terrible.

664
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,000
I've never seen a man killed before.

665
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,800
I think there was something
funny about the whole thing.

666
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,300
- Funny?
- Something wrong.

667
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,600
Of course there was.
Some ice for Mr. Martins.

668
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,500
- You think so too, hmm?
- It was so terribly stupid...

669
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,100
for a man like Harry to be killed
in an ordinary street accident.

670
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,300
- That's all you meant?
- What else?

671
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,200
Who was the third man?

672
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,100
[Chuckles]
I oughtn't to drink it.

673
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,100
It makes me acid.

674
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,100
What man would you be
referring to, Mr. Martins?

675
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,000
I was told that a third man
helped you and Kurtz carry the body.

676
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
Oh, I don't know
how you got that idea.

677
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,600
You'll find all about it
in the police report.

678
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,500
There was just the two of us.
Me and the baron.

679
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,000
Who could have told you
a story like that?

680
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,100
The porter at Harry's place.
He was cleaning the window at the time.

681
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,200
And saw the accident?

682
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,100
No, he didn't see the accident,
but he saw three men carrying the body.

683
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,000
Why wasn't he at the police inquiry?

684
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,000
He doesn't want to get involved.

685
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,700
You'll never teach these
Austrians to be good citizens.

686
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,600
It was his duty
to give the evidence.

687
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,600
Even so, he remembers wrong.

688
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,900
What else did he tell you?

689
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,600
That Harry was dead before
you got him to that statue.

690
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,400
He probably knows
a lot more than that.

691
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,100
- Somebody's lying.
- Hmm, not necessarily.

692
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,200
The police say he was
mixed up in some, uh, racket?

693
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh, that's quite impossible.
He had a great sense of duty.

694
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,700
Your friend Kurtz seems
to think it was possible.

695
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,100
I understand how an Anglo-Saxon feels.
The baron hasn't traveled, you know?

696
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,900
He seems to have been around a bit.

697
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,900
Do you know a man
called, uh, Harbin?

698
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,900
- No.
- Joseph Harbin.

699
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,200
Joseph Harbin? No.

700
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,700
That's a nice girl, that,
but she ought to go careful in Vienna.

701
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,600
Everybody ought to go careful
in a city like this.

702
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,100
He will meet us at the bridge. Good.

703
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,100
Hello!
Is it so very important for you?

704
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,700
- Yes, it is.
- I am not a bad man.

705
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,000
I'd like to tell you something.

706
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,000
Tell me, how did the car-

707
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,200
Shh, shh. Come tonight.
My wife goes out.

708
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,700
- All right, I'll come back, but -

Oh, yes, yes. Come in.

The porter's going
to talk to us tonight.

Need we go through it all again?

714
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,500
I can manage by myself.
You busy?

715
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,000
Just another part I've got to learn.

716
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,300
Can I hear you?

717
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
- In German?
- I can try.

718
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,100
- Is it comedy or tragedy?
- Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

719
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,600
- Do I, uh, read -
- Well, you read this.

720
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,700
Oh. Well, uh -

Oh, let me see.
No, no, that's not the cue.

725
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,400
It means she has to sit down.

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,400

It's always bad around this time.

731
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,800
He used to look in around 6:00.

732
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,700
I've been frightened. I've been alone
without friends and money.

anything like this.

Oh, anything. Just talk.

When? What did you do?

Oh, we didn't make much sense.
We drank too much.

- Where is she?

seem like such, uh, fun.

- I suppose so. He could fix anything.

- What sort of things?
- Oh, little things.

He fixed my papers for me.

749
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,300
He heard the Russians
were repatriating people

750
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,500
like me who came from Czechoslovakia.

751
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,700
He knew the right person
straightaway for forging stamps.

752
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,300
Yeah.

753

the three-card trick.

- That's growing up fast.
- He never grew up.

around him, that's all.

- And buried him.

Come on out and have a drink.

760
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,500
Why did you say that?

761
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,000
Seemed like a good idea.

762
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,800
It was just what he used to say.

763
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,900
Well, uh, I didn't
learn that from him.

If we have to see the porter,
we'd better go.

- Zane Grey.

Yes. It's called The Third Man.

- It's a murder story.

- Mixing fact and fiction.

- Should I make it all fact?
- Why, no, Mr. Martins.

enough penicillin to go round.

from the military hospitals...

and selling it to patients.

- Do you see what that means?
- Are you too busy...

to investigate a murder?

penicillin against meningitis.

at the general hospital.

938

He worked for Lime and helped to steal
the stuff from the laboratories.

We forced him to give information to us
which led us as far as Kurtz and Lime.

01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,800
International Police
Headquarters, just to check up.

1093
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,700
[German]

1094
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,400
[German]

1095
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,200
I'm sorry, miss. It's orders.
We can't go against the protocol.

1096
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,300
- I don't even know what protocol means.
- Neither do I, miss.

1097
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,400
Mademoiselle, your lipstick.

1098
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,500
Thank you.

1099
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,400
- Anna, what's happened to you?
- [Man] All right. Keep out of this.

1100
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,600
[Holly] Listen, I've got to talk to you.
I've just seen a dead man walking.

1101
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,200
- All right, chum. Get back.
- I saw him buried.

1102
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:27,100
And now I've seen him alive.

1103
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,200
Just a minute.
Bring her in here.

1104
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,100
You stay out here.

1105
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,200
Come in, Miss Schmidt.

1106
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,300
Now then, Miss Schmidt.

1107
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,100
I'm not interested in
your forged papers.

1108
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,100
That's purely a Russian case.

1109
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,400
- When did you last see Lime?
- Two weeks ago.

1110
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,800
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt.
We know he's alive.

1111
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,100
- It is true, then.

1112
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,100
Joseph Harbirs body was
found in the coffin.

1113
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,600
What did you say?
I'm sorry.

1114
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,100
I said another man
was buried in his place.

1115
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,100
Where's Harry?

1116
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,800
That's what we want to find out.

1117
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,200
I'm sorry. I don't seem able
to understand anything you say. I-

1118
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,200
He is alive.

1119
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,300
Now this minute,
he is doing something.

1120
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,400
Miss Schmidt, we know he's somewhere
across the canal in the Russian sector.

1121
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,800
You may as well help us.
In a few minutes...

1122
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,300
Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you
about your papers.

1123
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,000
- Tell me where Lime is.
- I don't know.

1124
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,400
If you help me,
I am prepared to help you.

1125
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,000
Martins always said you were a fool.

1126
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,100
Vienna is a closed
city, Miss Schmidt.

1127
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,600
He can't get away. Right.

1128
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,600
Poor Harry.

1129
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,200
I wish he was dead.

1130
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,700
He would be safe
from all of you then.

1131
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,700
Why, that's you!
Come up.

1132
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,600
Winkel, look who is here.

1133
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,600
I want to speak to you, Kurtz.

1134
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,200
- Of course. Come up.
- I'll wait here.

1135
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,800
- I don't understand.
- I want to talk to Harry.

1136
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,100
- Are you mad?
- All right. I'm mad.

1137
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,800
I've seen a ghost.
You tell Harry I want to see him.

1138
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,500
Be reasonable.
Come up and talk.

1139
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,200
No, thank you.
I like the open.

1140
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:38,000
Tell him I'll wait
by that wheel there.

1141
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,100
Or do ghosts only rise
by night, Dr. Winkel?

1142
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,600
You got an opinion on that?

1143
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,300
- Hello, old man. How are you?
- Hello, Harry.

1144
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,100
Well, well, they seem to be
giving you quite some busy time.

1145
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,100
- Well, listen.
- Hmm, yes?

1146
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,700
- I want to talk to you.
- Talk to me?

1147
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,500
Well, of course. Come on.

1148
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,500
Kids used to ride this thing
a lot in the old days.

1149
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,100
But they haven't
the money now, poor devils.

1150
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:10,900
[German]

1151
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,800
Listen, Harry.
I didn't believe that -

1152
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,500
- It's good to see you, Holly.
- I was at your funeral.

1153
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,100
That was pretty smart, wasn't it?

1154
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,300
Oh, the same old indigestion, Holly.

1155
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,500
These are the only things
that help - these tablets.

1156
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,400
These are the last. Can't get 'em
anywhere in Europe anymore.

1157
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,600
Do you know what's
happened to your girl?

1158
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:28,900
Hmm?

1159
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,600
- She's been arrested.
- Tough. Very tough.

1160
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:31,700
But don't worry, old man.

1161
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,600
- They won't hurt her.

1162
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,400
They're handing her
over to the Russians.

1163
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,700
What can I do, old man?
I'm dead, aren't I?

1164
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,700
- You can help somehow.
- Holly...

1165
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,500
exactly who did you tell
about me, hmm?

1166
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,600
- I told the police.
- Unwise, Holly.

1167
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,800
- And Anna.
- Unwise.

1168
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,600
Did the, uh, police believe you?

1169
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,700
You don't care anything at all
about Anna, do you?

1170
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,700
[Chuckling]
I've got quite a lot on my mind.

1171
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,700
- You wouldn't do anything.

1172
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,200
What do you want me
to do? Be reasonable.

1173
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,000
- You can get somebody else -
- Do you expect me to give myself up?

1174
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,400
- Why not?

1175
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,200
"It's a far, far better
thing that I do,"

1176
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,000
the old limelight, the
fall of the curtain -

1177
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:06,900
No. Holly, you and I aren't heroes.
The world doesn't make any heroes -

1178
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,100
- You've got plenty of contacts.
- outside of your stories.

1179
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,400
I've got to be so careful.

1180
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,900
I'm only safe in the Russian zone. I'm
only safe as long as they can use me.

1181
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,100
- As long as they can use you?
- I wish I could get rid of this thing.

1182
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,600
So that's how they found out about Anna.
You told them, didn't you?

1183
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,700
Don't try to be a policeman,
old man.

1184
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,000
- What do you expect me
to be? Part of your-

1185
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,100
Part?

1186
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,700
You can have any part you want
as long as you don't interfere.

1187
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,300
I've never cut you out of anything.

1188
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,500
Yes, I remember when they raided the
gambling joint, you knew a safe way out.

1189
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:33,800
Sure!

1190
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,800
Yeah, safe for you. Not safe for me.

1191
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:41,500
Old man, you never should have
gone to the police, you know.

1192
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,500
You ought to leave this thing alone.

1193
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,400
Have you ever seen
any of your victims?

1194
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,900
You know, I never feel comfortable
on these sort of things.

1195
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,500
Victims?
Don't be melodramatic.

1196
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,500
Tell me.

1197
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,400
Would you really feel any pity if one
of those dots stopped moving forever?

1198
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,700
If I offered you £20,000
for every dot that stopped...

1199
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,200
would you really, old man,
tell me to keep my money?

1200
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:12,300
Or would you calculate how many
dots you could afford to spend?

1201
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,300
Free of income tax, old man.
Free of income tax -

1202
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,100
the only way
you can save money nowadays.

1203
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,300
- A lot of good your
money will do you in jail.

1204
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,600
That jail's in another zone.

1205
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,600
There's no proof against me...

1206
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,600
besides you.

1207
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,100
I should be pretty easy
to get rid of.

1208
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,400
- Pretty easy.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

1209
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,300
I carry a gun.

1210
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,900
I don't think they'd look for a bullet
wound after you hit that ground.

1211
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,700
They dug up your coffin.

1212
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,500
And found Harbin?

1213
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,000
Mm-hmm.

1214
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,200
Pity.
[Chuckles] Holly.

1215
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,800
What fools we are
talking to each other this way...

1216
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:16,700
as though I'd do anything to you
or you to me.

1217
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,500
You're just a little mixed up
about things in general.

1218
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,400
Nobody thinks in terms
ofhuman beings.

1219
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,400
Governments don't.
Why should we?

1220
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,400
They talk about the people
and the proletariat.

1221
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,100
I talk about the suckers and the mugs.

1222
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:35,000
It's the same thing. They have their
five-year plans, and so have I.

1223
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,800
You used to believe in God.

1224
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,600
I still do believe in God, old man.

1225
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,500
I believe in God and mercy
and all that.

1226
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,900
But the dead are happier dead.

1227
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,100
They don't miss much here,
poor devils.

1228
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,700
What do you believe in?

1229
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,200
Oh, if you ever get Anna out
of this mess, be kind to her.

1230
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,300
I think you'll find she's won'th it.

1231
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,500
I wish I'd asked you to bring me
some of these tablets from home.

1232
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,300
Holly, I'd like to cut you in,
old man.

1233
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,500
There's nobody left in
Vienna I can really trust,

1234
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,400
and we've always done
everything together.

1235
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,500
When you make up your
mind, send me a message.

1236
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,900
I'll meet you anyplace, anytime.

1237
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
And when we do meet, old man,
it's you I want to see...

1238
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,200
not the police.

1239
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,200
Remember that, won't you?

1240
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,800
[Chuckling] And don't be so gloomy.

they had warfare, terror,
murder and bloodshed...
