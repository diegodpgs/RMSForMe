1
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,180
It's time.

2
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,750
Hey there...

3
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,690
...good morning. How are you today?

4
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,330
Hey. What are you doing up?

5
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,520
Moo.

6
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,770
Is that Daddy?

7
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,970
Hey there, cowgirl.

8
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,570
She's a little feisty today.

9
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,710
Babies should be sleeping.

10
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,520
"I'm too hungry for my own good."
Yes.

11
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,830
I gotta get ready.

12
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,590
Wrong day to be forgetting stuff.

13
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,030
You know how lucky you are.
Don't screw this up.

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,170
All right! Jesus.

15
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,340
-She go back to sleep?
-Yes. Ate like a pig.

16
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,880
I know I'm lucky. I ace this job,
the department's wide open.

17
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,650
Get my own division someday.
You should see their houses.

18
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,930
Hello?

19
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,660
Well, yes.

20
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,100
Don't worry, I will.

21
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,230
He's right here.
It's Alonzo.

22
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,170
-Hello.
-Hoyt?

23
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,440
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,350
-Going to roll call?
-I'm leaving now.

25
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,650
-Hoyt?
-Yes, sir?

26
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,420
-Fairies go to roll call. We don't.
-Good to know.

27
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,820
There's a coffee shop on 7th.
Be there at 10.

28
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,560
Be in comfortable shoes.
Got a backup gun?

29
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,570
-Only the standard issue Beretta.
-Bring it. Cuffs too.

30
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,260
Maybe we'll do some business.
We 're aggressive.

31
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,140
I know. That's why I signed up.
I want to thank you for this--

32
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,990
What's wrong?

33
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,630
Feels like football tryouts.

34
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,790
I wish it was tomorrow
so I'd know if I made the squad.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,800
Listen, it's not tomorrow, it's today.

36
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,770
-I know it's gonna work out.
-You do?

37
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,590
Good morning, sir.

38
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,290
No, thank you, ma'am.

39
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,970
Get some chow in you.
My dollar.

40
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,460
Thank you, sir, but I ate.

41
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,940
Fine. Don't.

42
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,270
It's nice here.

43
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,710
May I read?

44
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,610
-I'm sorry, sir. I--
-Thank you.

45
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,250
-I'll get something to eat.
-Hell, no you won't. You fucked up.

46
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,090
I'm trying to read. Please shut up.

47
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,320
I'll like not being in a hot
black and white all summer.

48
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,520
Tell me a story, Hoyt.

49
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,490
-Like my story?
-Not your story, a story.

50
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,260
Since you can't shut up
so I can read, tell me a story.

51
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,700
-I don't know any.
-You don't?

52
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,400
-No.
-I'll tell you one.

53
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,940
This is a newspaper, right?
It's 90 percent bullshit.

54
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,670
But it's entertaining. So I read it.

55
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,610
It entertains me. You won't let me
read it, so you entertain me.

56
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,850
Tell me a story now. Go.

57
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,420
-There was a DUI stop.
-A DUI stop?

58
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,250
Let me load up!

59
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,450
-A DUl? Oh, shit!
-Well, l--

60
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,720
-Listen, we were on midwatch--
-We who?

61
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,870
-Oh, me and Debbie.
-Who's Debbie?

62
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,240
Debbie Maxwell, my training officer.

63
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,670
-A female training officer?
-Yes, sir.

64
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,070
Okay. All right.

65
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,940
Was she black, white?

66
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,550
She was white.

67
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,980
-Lick-her license?
-A what?

68
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,550
A lick-her license.
Was she a dyke, a lesbian?

69
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,060
-Is she any good?
-She's pretty good.

70
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,660
-Okay, Debbie, midwatch. Go.
-Right.

71
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,960
-It was a quiet night--
-Boom!

72
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,100
-What the fuck?
-You never know, that's the point. Go.

73
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,830
It was quiet and we're rolling...

74
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,600
...l'm driving. This Acura,
just a beautiful car...

75
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,510
...comes out a side street, all over
the median. I hit the wailer.

76
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,980
He drives for 10 blocks
before he pulls over.

77
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,090
Plates run clean,
so I test and arrest.

78
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,590
I'm belting in our unit,
and she's tossing his car.

79
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:02,560
She shows me a .38
and two loaded shotguns.

80
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,250
-No shit?
-No shit! So...

81
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,330
...she calls and I'm searching.
I find 500 grams of meth.

82
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,440
Turns out he's on bail
for distribution...

83
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,310
...on his way to smoke
his ex-partner before trial.

84
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,530
Boom.

85
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,310
-Prevented a murder.
-You got him. It's amazing.

86
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,480
It is. That you're out there...

87
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,850
...with a fine bitch for a year and
the best story you can tell me...

88
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,790
...is a drunk stop.

89
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,530
But I don't believe you.
You tapped that ass, didn't you?

90
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,390
Tell the truth.
You know you tapped that ass.

91
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,510
In the back, bam! Code X.

92
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,480
-I got a wife.
-You got a dick.

93
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,340
-You do have one, don't you?
-Yes.

94
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,010
Your dick lines up straight.
Right and left of it are pockets.

95
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,420
In those pockets are money.
Look in either one. Pay the bill.

96
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,630
Grab that menu off that window for me.

97
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,370
Get in, it's unlocked.

98
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,280
Throw that in the glove box.

99
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,390
-This is not from the motor pool.
-No. Sexy, though, huh?

100
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,720
-Where's the office, at division?
-You're in the office.

101
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,620
Going up.

102
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,450
Today is a training day.

103
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,830
Give you a taste of the business.

104
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,600
I got 38 cases pending trial...

105
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,060
...63 active investigations,
250 I can't clear.

106
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,460
I supervise five officers.
Five personalities.

107
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,400
Five sets of problems.
You could be six.

108
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,970
I ain't holding no hands.

109
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,170
You got today to show me
what you're made of.

110
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,450
You don't like Narcotics,
get the fuck out of my car...

111
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,810
...get a job chasing bad checks.
You hear me?

112
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,510
-I hear you.
-Okay.

113
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,190
Why do you want to be a narc?

114
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,920
To serve my community by ridding
it of dangerous drugs.

115
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,960
Right, but why a narc?

116
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,100
I want to make detective.

117
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,210
Stick with me, you can do it.

118
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,870
Unlearn that academy shit.

119
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,940
Don't bring that here.
It'll get you killed.

120
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,480
I'll do anything you want me to do.

121
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,250
My nigger.

122
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,150
Roll your window down. Start there.

123
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,960
-Got to hear it, smell it, taste it.
-Right.

124
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,430
How's your Espanol?.

125
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,160
Learn that shit.

126
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,630
That will get you killed.

127
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,930
They plot all kinds of shit
behind your back.

128
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,570
You gonna teach me that
old-school Rodney IKing shit?

129
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,470
We don't roll like that no more.

130
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,980
Now we use this.

131
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,310
These niggers are too strong.

132
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,780
-Think I'm crazy?
-I don't know what to think.

133
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,650
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

134
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,450
Good.

135
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,150
Good.

136
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,570
Been married long?

137
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,540
-About a year.
-Yeah?

138
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,580
-You got a kid?
-A girl, 9 months.

139
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,480
I got four. Boys.

140
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,050
You need a son,
I'll hook your lady up. Can't miss.

141
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,420
Can we not talk
about my family, all right?

142
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,620
I respect that.

143
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,130
I'm married, I got my queen too.

144
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,830
I remember having a young bride.

145
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,300
You probably fuck her face-to-face,
don't you?

146
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,170
Let's not talk about her.

147
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,140
That's my point. You're so in love,
it's coming right out.

148
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,270
The day you bring
that here is the day...

149
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,210
...you don't make it back.
Hide it deep inside of you.

150
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,780
The maggots out here
will find it...

151
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,650
...use it against you
and chew you up.

152
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,120
Never wear the ring to work.

153
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,760
-I'm serious about that.
-Thanks.

154
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,890
What's here?

155
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,360
Transactions.

156
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,330
You see that guy trying to act
like he's not slanging dope?

157
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,600
-Yeah.
-That's my boy.

158
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,300
That's my boy, Neto.

159
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,810
Only 1 7, but he can kill.

160
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,610
-Works for me.
-He's an informer?

161
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,940
Teammate. I got eyes everywhere.

162
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:03,320
He gets to make some cash.
Lets me know when big things happen.

163
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,390
Big transactions.

164
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,330
-You trust him?
-Damn right I do.

165
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,970
Sprung his mom from INS detention.
Here we go. Watch this.

166
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,700
That's right. Come on down.

167
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,140
Come on. Look at it. Sexy, ain't it?

168
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,050
That's right.

169
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,720
-See the hand-to-hand?
-I saw it.

170
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,150
-When was your last felony stop?
-Two weeks ago.

171
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,520
You need practice.

172
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,020
-College kids.
-They'll get an education today.

173
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,320
I want them grabbing glass.
You take the back.

174
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,330
Stay off of the Rover.

175
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's go.

176
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,340
-You little fuckers.
-Run, baby, run.

177
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,090
Police! Let's see your hands!

178
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,060
Put them up! Put them up!

179
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,750
Put your hands on the windshield!

180
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,590
-Put your hands on the glass.
-Driver, put it in park!

181
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,970
-It's a stick shift!
-Throw the keys out the window!

182
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,500
Put your hands on your chest!

183
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,670
All right, fork it over.

184
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,040
-What?
-You know.

185
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,880
The marijuana. Give it to me!

186
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,250
-Give it!
-Okay! Sorry, sir.

187
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,220
-Shut up! Give me that pipe.
-My mom gave me that pipe.

188
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,790
She can pick it up in jail.
Give me the cigarettes too.

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,330
-Control your suspect!
-Palms on the glass!

190
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,630
Move the hands, I'll slap you!
Face against the glass! Right there!

191
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,830
You know this is a gang neighborhood?

192
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,880
-Yeah!
-Then don't come down here.

193
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,810
I see you down here again,
I'll make you walk home.

194
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,180
I'll let the homeboys run
a train on her. IKnow what that is?

195
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,620
Yes, sir.

196
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,450
All right, gentlemen.
Thanks for your cooperation.

197
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,170
Let's go. Safe your iron, son.

198
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,130
Shit!

199
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,440
I like that shit.

200
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,740
I like how you move.
You were trained well.

201
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,910
Check that out. It's a bad dime.
See the hairs, undeveloped seeds.

202
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,060
You see how immature it is.

203
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,690
That's classic Mexican garbage.

204
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,830
Let me see. It's old.
Probably last year's.

205
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,660
To be truly effective...

206
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,960
...a good narcotics agent
must know and love narcotics.

207
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,830
A good narcotics agent should have...

208
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,170
...narcotics in his blood.

209
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,480
-What, you gonna smoke that?
-No, you are.

210
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,320
-Hell if I am!
-Yes.

211
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,250
-You're not?
-No.

212
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,150
-Why? You a Mormon?
-I'm not losing my job.

213
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,590
This is your job.

214
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,320
-Smoke it.
-No.

215
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,550
This ain't a test. Take a hit.

216
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,660
Listen, I became a cop
to stop people from using--

217
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,370
-That ain't cocaine. Take a hit.
-No, man.

218
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,770
-Jesus Christ!
-Yeah, right.

219
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,740
If I was a dealer, you'd be dead!

220
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,540
Turn shit down out here,
and your wife gets a flag.

221
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,220
What's wrong with you?

222
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,050
You know what?

223
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,350
I don't want you in my unit.
Get the fuck out of my car, rookie.

224
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,420
Poo butt-ass.

225
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,860
-What's the holdup?
-Move it!

226
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,540
Give me that thing.

227
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,500
I'll smoke it. Give it to me.

228
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,780
You want me to, I'll smoke it.

229
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,360
Virgin lungs. Man up now.
Man up, nigger. Man up.

230
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,920
Go ahead. Get it.

231
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,660
-Come on!
-Shut the fuck up and just wait!

232
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,940
-Man the fuck up! Finish that shit!
-Geronimo.

233
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,080
Let's go, nigger. Let's go.

234
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,640
Oh, shit!

235
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,410
You okay, kid?

236
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,420
That's a man size hit you took.
When's the last time you smoked weed?

237
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,050
The last-- Twelfth grade.

238
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,060
We were....

239
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,930
-Well, we were....
-Smoking weed.

240
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,630
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

241
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,970
Left that out of your service jacket.

242
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,370
I know you got secrets.
Everybody got secrets.

243
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,680
-Didn't know you liked it wet, though.
-What's wet?

244
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,020
Butt-naked. Ill. Sherm. Dust.

245
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,990
PCP. Primos. P-dog.

246
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,290
That's what you had.

247
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,930
You couldn't taste it?

248
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,570
-I never done it.
-I haven't, but you have now.

249
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,500
Shit!

250
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,110
Shit. I'll get piss-tested,
and I'll get fired.

251
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,310
The boss has our back.
We know before we piss.

252
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,950
-Shit!
-Boom!

253
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,630
Why did you do this?

254
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,560
You're an adult.
Nobody made you smoke.

255
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,800
You made a decision. Live with it.

256
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,800
Not like I put a gun to your head.

257
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,000
Man....

258
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,290
-Oh, man, shit.
-Come on, get your shit together now.

259
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,920
This is my dog's house.

260
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,430
We'll see what he thinks of you.

261
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,180
-Get your ass in here!
-Roger, what's up?

262
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,980
-How are they treating you?
-All right.

263
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,050
-I didn't wake you up?
-I never sleep.

264
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,410
Right. This my new guy, Jake.

265
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,210
Come on. Get in here.

266
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,990
Yeah. Time to get my swerve on here!

267
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,560
-What you drinking?
-The best.

268
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,670
The best, I know. Best for the best.

269
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,900
I heard about Vegas.
Got a green light on your ass.

270
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,630
No problem.

271
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,360
Russians want you. I got your back.

272
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,770
I know that. Thank you.

273
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,620
Here. Get that medicine up in you.

274
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,020
-Back to the world.
-Back to the world.

275
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,230
Went and got yourself
a daisy-fresh rookie.

276
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,630
He's high as a motherfucker.
What did you give him?

277
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,400
-A little of Mexico's finest.
-Yeah.

278
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,920
Garbage.

279
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,280
-Where'd you grow up?
-North Hollywood.

280
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,460
-What's your last name?
-Hoyt.

281
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,750
Hoyt. Hoyt....

282
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,060
-Strong safety, North Hollywood High.
-Right.

283
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,630
-How'd you know that?
-How did you?

284
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,900
-I follow all the good players.
-No doubt.

285
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,800
Excuse me. Shit.

286
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,440
-Strong safety, huh?
-It's me. What's up?

287
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,880
I can't do anything.
Clean up your own mess. Don't call me.

288
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,160
Hey! Here's a joke, boy.

289
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,920
Man walks out of his house,
sees this snail lying on his porch.

290
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,000
So he picks it up,
chucks it into the backyard.

291
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,660
Snail bounces off a rock,
busts its shell up all to shit...

292
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,600
...lands in the grass.

293
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,110
Snail lies there dying.

294
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,240
But...

295
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,680
...snail doesn't die.
Soon it can crawl again.

296
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,580
And one day...

297
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,620
...snail heads back
to the front of the house.

298
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,890
Finally, after about a year...

299
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,190
...the little guy crawls
back on the porch.

300
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,530
Right then the man walks
out of his house...

301
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,900
...sees this snail again.

302
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,600
So he looks at it...

303
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,670
...and he says:

304
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,140
"The fuck's your problem?"

305
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,610
That's not funny.

306
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,050
What you laughing for then?

307
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,690
-I don't know, man. I--
-Hey!

308
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,560
Figure that joke out,
you'll figure the streets out.

309
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,060
Nothing to figure out.
It's senseless bullshit.

310
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,670
-You know-- I already figured it out.
-Really?

311
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,470
-Yeah.
-You already figured the streets out?

312
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,510
Well, it's all about smiles and cries.

313
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,180
-Put the drink down. What is that?
-Hold on!

314
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,080
Hold on. Smiles and cries.

315
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,810
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries. I hear you.

316
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,450
Yeah, you gotta control
your smiles and cries...

317
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,860
...because that's all you have,
and nobody can take that away.

318
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,170
Oh, shit.

319
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,180
What you think, dog? Think this
greenhorn can handle undercover?

320
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,080
You were just like him.
Same silly-ass look and everything.

321
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,190
Saving the goddamn world.

322
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,850
Now that's some smiles
and cries for your ass!

323
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,790
-That was you.
-Shit lasted a week.

324
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,960
Gotta get back to it.

325
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,900
Thanks for the snort.

326
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,570
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

327
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,900
Yes, sir. What you doing later?

328
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,070
Stay home. Save some cheddar.

329
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:39,210
My dream's less than a year away.
Philippine lslands, here I come.

330
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,440
-Let me go too.
-You're invited.

331
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:02,360
Hey. Open your eyes, man.
You'll feel a lot better.

332
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,830
Boom! Come on, man. Sit your ass up.

333
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,240
Who are you?

334
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,350
I'm the Zig-Zag man. Who are you?

335
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,680
-I'm a cop. Watch out!
-Don't shoot nobody.

336
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,360
Get that beer in you for ballast.

337
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,300
-No, man.
-Get it in you. You'll feel better.

338
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,040
Stop the car!

339
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,240
Stop the car! I saw something!

340
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,890
-Just relax.
-Stop!

341
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,020
All right! Hold the fuck on-- Hey!

342
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,960
Fuck me, man! Shit.

343
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,170
Police officer!
Get away from the girl!

344
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,270
-I'm gonna fuck you too, cop!
-Get the--

345
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,600
We didn't do shit! Bitch is crazy!

346
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,580
Roll over, man. Roll the fuck over!

347
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,550
Fucking ass prick!

348
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,380
My nigger!

349
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,460
Go ahead, cowboy,
you got mad squabbles.

350
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,760
-Thanks for the help.
-You should've shot them.

351
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,260
What's happening?

352
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,870
-You're dead!
-Okay! Wait! Hold it!

353
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,010
-You too, white boy!
-Okay....

354
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,470
-My cousins will blast you fools!
-Calm down.

355
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,010
-Calm down. You okay?
-No, I'm not!

356
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,240
-Look at my nose!
-I see it.

357
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,250
Put ice on it. You'll be fine.
What're you doing here?

358
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,980
-I was just--
-They probably got AIDS.

359
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,750
Why you not at school?

360
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,220
I was going to a ditch party and--

361
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,920
You almost became the ditch party.

362
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,760
-Where your cousins from?
-Hillside Trece!

363
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,700
-Remember that!
-Tell your cousins to get your back.

364
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,130
Grab your bag and go home now.

365
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,700
-No! I need a statement--
-Don't need no statement.

366
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,070
-They'll fuck you up.
-We gonna let them go?

367
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,680
You wanna beat them up, go ahead.

368
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,910
I got a punching bag at home.
They should be off the streets.

369
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,780
You hear that?

370
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,750
-Wanna go home or to jail?
-What you think?

371
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,820
Got room at the booty house.
You been there?

372
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,460
-You'll grab your ankles.
-Suck my dick!

373
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,660
-I know people.
-That's how it starts.

374
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,200
What about you? What you got?

375
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,960
-Got nothing?
-No.

376
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,540
-You sure?
-Yeah.

377
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,940
-Where's your horn?
-Got none.

378
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,780
You got money, though.

379
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,680
You lied to me!

380
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,990
Lucky I don't make you eat that.

381
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,860
Stand up, you. Stand the fuck up!

382
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,900
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?

383
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,770
Turn around, sucker. Turn around.

384
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,350
So you like raping girls?

385
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,050
-Like to rape girls?
-No, man.

386
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,380
-That's what you like?
-No....

387
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,020
That what you like? Don't lie.

388
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,720
Told me to suck your dick.
Is that what you said?

389
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,660
Look at me.

390
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,690
You wanted me
to suck your dick, right?

391
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,140
Isn't that what you said?

392
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,670
Didn't you say suck it?
Don't lie. Am I a liar?

393
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,240
You didn't say that?

394
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,040
That's not what you said?
So I'm lying?

395
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,520
-No, please!
-Where is it? I can't find it.

396
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,050
Pull your pants down.

397
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,960
Which nut you want?
I'll leave you one.

398
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,160
Your choice. Just make a decision.

399
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,500
All right.
Put your hands on your head.

400
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,300
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

401
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,750
Lucky I got other business.

402
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:23,480
I'd cut your fucking dick off
and stick it up your funky ass. Bitch.

403
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,720
Damn! I'm thirsty.
I want a beer. What about you?

404
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,620
You want a beer?

405
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,100
I'm gonna leave you three to it.

406
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,170
Pussy-ass bitch!

407
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,140
I see you again, I'll fuck you up!

408
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,780
You won't see shit coming!

409
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,510
I'll dent your mouth,
I'll crack your head open.

410
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,380
You fucking pig! Come on!

411
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,100
-That girl's 14.
-She all woman, though.

412
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,970
You tax that ass for days, man!
IKeep walking, bitch!

413
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,380
You want a beer?

414
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,420
-No, I don't want a beer, man.
-No? You mad?

415
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,800
Want to book that $60, huh?

416
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,700
Here, go ahead, book it into evidence.

417
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,410
Where the suspects? Go get them.

418
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,340
You let them go.

419
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,170
-I let them go?
-You did.

420
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,540
You want to run and gun,
stay in Patrol.

421
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,650
This is lnvestigations.

422
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,680
Garbage men handle garbage.

423
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,650
Professional anglers
go after the big fish.

424
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,380
Chasing them crackhead
motherfuckers....

425
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,220
-They'd have killed you.
-They belong in jail.

426
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,060
Why? They got beaten,
lost their money.

427
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,700
Hillside's éses will smoke them.
What more you want?

428
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,870
-I want justice.
-That's not justice?

429
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,070
-That's street justice.
-So?

430
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,610
-Let them kill each other?
-God willing.

431
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,210
Fuck them!
Everybody looking like them.

432
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,440
Reality is, the good guys...

433
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,850
...they die first.
The school kids and moms...

434
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,450
...family men, don't want to catch
any bullets.

435
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,220
To protect the sheep,
you got to catch the wolf.

436
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,330
It takes a wolf to catch a wolf,
understand?

437
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,550
What?

438
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,820
-Protect the sheep by killing wolves.
-I heard you.

439
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,800
-You didn't hear me.
-All right. Whatever.

440
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,800
Whatever the fuck-ever!

441
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,380
Do you ever lock anybody up?
You seem busy keeping people out.

442
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,280
You don't know shit!

443
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,930
Shit, they build jails because of me!

444
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,420
Judges gave over 1 5,000 man-years
of incarceration time...

445
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,160
...based on my cases.
My record speaks for itself.

446
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,300
How many felons have you got?

447
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,840
I rest my case.

448
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,550
-I'm not smoking crack, all right?
-I'm glad. Put it in the glove box.

449
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,950
Put the $60 in there too.

450
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:46,450
That'll come in handy.
We'll use it like a credit card.

451
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,500
No matter what I say,
you did the right thing.

452
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:04,810
Reminds me when I was
chasing down bad guys.

453
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,670
Pretty amazing shit you did
back there.

454
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,940
Thanks.

455
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,040
I noticed you applied that chokehold
though, huh?

456
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,890
That's a no-no procedure.

457
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,590
-I was getting my ass kicked.
-You did what you had to do.

458
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,460
You did what you had to do.

459
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,160
That's right.

460
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,070
What a wolf does. You a wolf?

461
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,040
Come on, wolf! Come on, dog!

462
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:45,140
No, I said a wolf,
not a rooster, a wolf.

463
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,590
-That's a rooster, give me a wolf!
-Give me a beer!

464
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,990
There you go! That's my nigga.

465
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,650
You got the magic eye, Hoyt.

466
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,920
You have the magic eye.

467
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,130
You up your street IQ...

468
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,960
...you'll do some damage,
I guarantee.

469
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,100
Crime fighter.

470
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,780
-What you need?

00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,640
Opening fire in a neighborhood.

00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:26,050
Where was the Sandman?
What were you doing back there?

about having us killed!

629
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,030
I'll be on the 6:00 news
in handcuffs because of you.

630
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,700
With the scandals,
it is open season on misconduct.

631
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,640
-They'll nail us to the wall.
-Pull over.

632
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,200
-Pull over.
-Here?

633
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,280
-Yeah, pull over.
-Shit!

634
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:16,860
What?

635
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,190
Listen.

636
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,730
You're in a privileged position
to learn.

637
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,040
IKeep your mouth shut, eyes open.

638
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,440
Want to do some good,
this is the place to learn.

639
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,810
You can't take it, maybe you
should go back to your division.

640
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,460
Get a nice job lighting flares
or measuring car wrecks.

641
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,620
You got to decide
whether you're a wolf...

642
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,260
...or a sheep.

643
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,300
Get your ink...

644
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,740
...or go give him a hand.

645
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:31,000
What are we doing here?
We'll get killed.

646
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:34,800
-You know about this place?
-It's the Jungle, right?

647
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,140
They say don't come with anything
less than a platoon.

648
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,060
This is the heart of it.

649
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,550
Jungle. Damu headquarters.

650
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,270
Stoners.

651
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:58,330
A lot of murder investigations
lead here.

652
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,830
One way in, one way out.

653
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,600
Thought we were going to eat.

654
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:08,110
Don't ever come here without me.
I'm serious. For your safety.

655
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,890
-How'd you get a golden pass?
-I treat them fair.

656
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,690
They know if they cross the line,
I tax that ass.

657
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,000
What's that, up there?

658
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,270
They flipping pigeons
to signal I'm here.

659
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,140
-What's up, Bone?
-What's up?

660
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,210
-What's up?
-It's all good.

661
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,810
I appreciate what you did
for my nephew.

662
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,710
For sure. For sure.

663
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,510
You better call me.

664
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,360
I'm sick of it.
I can't stand him!

665
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:32,190
-Who are they?
-Nobody. I got them under my thumb.

666
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,460
-What's up, Alonzo?
-All right, Spider. What's happening?

667
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:40,100
Hey, what's up, girl? Look at you.
Go ahead.

668
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,600
All that jelly and no toast.

669
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,470
-Who lives here?
-Just one of my lovelies.

670
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,270
A loving touch, you know?
Don't worry.

671
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,660
New guy, Jake.

672
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,070
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to my house.

673
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,810
-Give him some food. Take care of him.
-Of course.

674
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,390
-Of course. How are you?
-Good, good.

675
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:38,190
I have cable.
You watch whatever you want, okay?

676
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,130
-Thanks.
-This is your house.

677
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,270
I'll be right back.

678
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,210
-How you doing?
-Fine.

679
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,120
Now, this is all EI Salvadorian food.

680
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:09,190
Thank you. It looks great.

681
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,690
I have to go.

682
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,600
Yeah, all right.

683
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,480
Let's go.
We got a meeting in 1 5 minutes.

684
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,610
-I just need to--
-Forget it. Let's go.

685
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,320
I'll see you, buddy.

686
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,580
You okay?

687
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,190
Here, use this.

688
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,260
-Who's here?
-L.A.P.D.'s finest.

689
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,790
Don't speak till you're spoken to.

690
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,090
Come on.

691
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,610
Good to see you.

692
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:49,950
That's my new guy. Jake Hoyt.
Captain Lou Jacobs.

693
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,780
Need to talk to the feds,
go to him first.

694
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,860
He'll take your back for you.

695
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,890
Stan Gursky,
he runs the D.A. shooting team.

696
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,720
Think about him
before you shoot someone.

697
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:04,230
If you're wrong,
he'll use your nuts for dice.

698
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,530
Right here,
Detective Doug Rosselli...

699
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,610
...handles theft cases
for the French-poodle crowd.

700
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,830
He's a good man.

701
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,380
-Pleased to meet you.
-Good man.

702
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,040
-Should l...?
-Shoo.

703
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,550
Get yourself a steak or something.

704
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,450
All right, gents.

705
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,460
I don't know why I'm meeting you.
I don't talk to dead men.

706
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:31,690
I ain't dead yet.

707
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,660
Fucking prick. Excuse me.

708
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,560
Why the long face, Doug?

709
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,770
-Feds seize your house or something?
-Fuck yourself.

710
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,100
Tell him the story.

711
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,400
Come on, tell the story.

712
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:51,340
-If it's so funny, you tell him.
-It's your story.

713
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,180
Asshole.

714
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,780
All right.
There's a serial burglar.

715
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,460
Chased him for a year.
A real slickster.

716
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,190
Captain's riding my ass
the whole time.

717
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,360
-Sentencing was today.
-Judge is female.

718
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,290
That's right. Landers.

719
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,940
I know Landers. She's a sharp lady.

720
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,370
No?

721
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:24,380
Guy gets ahold of some peanut butter,
packs his ass-crack with it.

722
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,520
He's standing before the bench,
waiting to give his statement.

723
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,160
Shoves his hand down his pants,
comes out with extra-chunky Jif.

724
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,430
Bailiffs won't come near him.

725
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,070
Now he looks the judge
right in the eyes...

726
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,540
...and licks his fingers clean.

727
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,010
Holy shit.

728
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,750
So the judge says:

729
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,750
"This man's insane.
He can't go to prison."

730
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,940
-Sends him to Psychiatric.
-She fell for it.

731
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,050
Yeah! She's so fucking smart.

732
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,850
By the time she found out,
the guy's already been transferred.

733
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,130
-Proceedings closed.
-Yeah, closed.

734
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,800
He'll do six months
in the puzzle factory...

735
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,500
...and they'll let him go.

736
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,900
Never, ever do a day in prison.

737
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,240
Give him credit. He worked the system,
deserves his freedom.

738
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,440
Yeah? Think so?

739
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,180
Or not.

740
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:36,220
I'll tell you what.

741
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,250
I'll find this guy on the street...

742
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,260
...and I'll do him.

743
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,430
Better take his bullets away,
Stan.

744
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,870
Shit!

745
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,630
Heard you had an expensive weekend
in Vegas.

746
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:02,140
How did you ever screw up so bad?

747
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:05,370
It's nothing.
I didn't know. It's not my town.

748
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,140
The Russians don't care
if you're a cop.

749
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,810
They'll whack you.
You ought to get on a plane.

750
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,180
Why?

751
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,780
-It's an easy fix.
-How?

752
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,960
I'll just cash in an account.

753
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,930
-Whose?
-One of my old ones. My first one.

754
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,900
The guy's a high-security risk.

755
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:29,440
If I'm not around,
who will keep him off the radar?

756
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,240
I'm just taxing him, that's all.
Okay?

757
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,150
It's your call.

758
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,230
Don't dick this up.

759
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:50,730
I do not want to see you
on the front page like the others.

760
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,220
Yeah, I understand.

761
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:55,660
Who's driving?

762
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,430
Me. Gray Mercedes.

763
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,570
Get the car.

764
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:09,170
Black Monte Carlo there,
back windows shot out.

765
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,060
It's me.
Listen, we got the green light.

766
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,800
Fax a copy
of the warrant to the clerk.

767
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,670
Get it signed by the judge, and I want
you and Paul to bring it to me.

768
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,330
Tell Jeff to pick up some tools.
Picks and shovels.

769
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:42,780
Make sure he signs them out
from maintenance. Copy?

770
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,820
That's right. Hurry up! Later.

771
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:50,210
So how much cash was in that jacket?

772
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,620
Forty G's.

773
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,860
What's that for?

774
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,990
-Really want to know?
-Yes, I do.

775
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,300
Nothing's free in this world.
Not even arrest warrants.

776
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:06,630
Shit, man, I didn't want to know.

777
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,780
Check this out.
Nice suit, Mark.

778
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,960
-Beautiful suit.
-Yeah, fuck you guys!

779
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,670
All right. Nice, nice.

780
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,670
What's up, Alonzo?

781
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,680
-The picks and shovels?
-In the trunk.

782
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,210
Digging a ditch?

783
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:55,050
No, you are.
Nice suit you got on there.

784
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,090
That's what I said.

785
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,590
-What up, killer?
-What's up with you?

786
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:04,200
-Heard you ran into trouble.
-It's all good.

787
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,760
Don't worry, everything's fine.

788
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:10,560
Shit, if we can get away with it,
I'm with you.

789
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:16,130
-Who the fuck is this?
-Jake Hoyt. It's my first day.

790
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,870
You're a long way from Starbucks.

791
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,120
-Why the fuck is he here?
-Gotta get his cherry popped.

792
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,250
Stay the fuck out of my way.

793
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:30,360
This is for the big dogs. Feel me?

794
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,620
Here it is, all legit,
signed by the judge, okay?

795
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,190
Thanks to the Sandman.
Now listen.

796
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,020
Safety is first.

797
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,790
He gives us shit,
we give him lead.

798
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,400
Let's do this right
so we can all go home.

799
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,400
Time to punch in, ladies.

800
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,550
Freeze! On the floor!

801
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,230
-Down!
-What are you clowns doing?

802
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:43,830
Hey, new guy, watch him!

803
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,890
-I'm on him.
-You know what you're doing?

804
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,360
Drop your gun!

805
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:52,300
Five. Four. Three.

806
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,700
Boom!

807
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,040
Give me a reason.

808
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:03,070
Alonzo's gonna have your ass.

809
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:05,210
What's up, Roger?

810
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:09,880
-What's going down, brother?
-Oh, it's all good, baby.

811
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,020
It's all good.

812
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:19,030
That's for you.

813
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:24,430
What am I supposed to do with this?
Wipe my ass?

814
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,230
Bad news, dog.

815
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,610
Gimme some of that $300-a-glass shit.

816
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,970
Please.

817
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,440
Had lunch with the wise men.

818
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,750
You gotta render unto Caesar.

819
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:44,410
-Those vampires want my pension.
-No, no.

820
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:51,160
Just a tax.

821
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:55,560
They got their boats and mistresses,
house payments.

822
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:59,600
Nothing I can do.
I'm just a lowly civil servant.

823
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,030
You're their bitch.

824
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,970
-What about me?
-I got your back.

825
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:09,270
Don't worry, we won't
take anything you'll miss.

826
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,350
I'm sorry. Orders, dog.

827
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:14,880
No you ain't, cop.

828
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,990
In the kitchen, fellas.

829
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,660
Give me the bitch.

830
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,360
You guys hold him down.

831
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:28,560
-Who'll pay for my floor?
-The city.

832
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,240
Right here.

833
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,110
That's what I'm talking about.

834
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,990
What's in here? Coke?

835
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,720
You'll see.

836
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:35,770
Grab that hammer
and knock this lock off.

837
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:40,540
One, two....

838
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,150
That's $250,000 you're holding.

839
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:53,820
Over four million in here.

840
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:56,010
A $3 million bust on day one.

841
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,450
-You said four.
-Minus tax, brother!

842
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:02,180
Nothing's free in this world.

843
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,870
Buy your wife a car.
Put the kids through college.

844
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:10,230
The only checks I cash say "L.A.P.D."

845
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:14,640
Somebody didn't sleep
through Ethics.

846
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,340
You don't want a piece of this?

847
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,710
No, right?

848
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,140
Not like this.

849
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:27,340
No.

850
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,280
No?

851
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:38,590
First time, you're not comfortable.
I'll hold it for you.

852
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,700
-What about you?
-Oh, I'm comfortable.

853
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,370
-How about you?
-I'm very comfortable.

854
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,760
Let's wrap this up.

855
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,870
Don't touch a thing! Evidence.

856
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:01,510
Alonzo, what are
those pricks thinking?

857
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:06,180
That I'm gonna stand still and
let them horsefuck me?

858
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:09,660
Could put you out of your misery.

859
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,460
Hey, Jake, here.

860
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,330
Sit down.

861
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,530
Here's a secret:

862
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,870
When you kill someone on duty...

863
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,950
...they have to be your slave
in the afterlife.

864
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,980
There you go.

865
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:36,950
Start an entourage.

866
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,960
-Shoot him?
-Yeah.

867
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,860
Come on, kid. Do me a favor.

868
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:46,790
Come on.

869
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:49,290
Do yourself a favor. Hit him.

870
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,760
Are you serious?

871
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:53,860
Hey, close the blinds.

872
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:06,710
-All right, I'll shoot him.
-Go.

873
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,350
-Pow!
-Boom!

874
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,020
Shoot him.

875
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:18,900
No, man.

876
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:23,570
IKids these days.
Not gonna do it?

877
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:26,330
All right, give it to me.

878
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,800
Rookies!

879
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,030
You want shit done,
you gotta do it yourself.

880
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:33,530
Holy shit!

881
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,310
Come on, breathe.

882
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,710
Breathe, there you go.

883
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,080
Just let it go.

884
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:46,890
Breathe, dog!

885
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,860
He's finished.

886
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,660
-Where's the stinger?
-Right here.

887
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,510
All right, Jeff.

888
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,510
You took fire coming in.

889
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,180
I need some time off, but....

890
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:14,820
-Watch the shades.
-All right.

891
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:19,850
-Ready?
-IKiss me.

892
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,620
One....

893
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:25,530
-You okay?
-Yeah.

894
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,200
I gotta give you one more, though.

895
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,460
Do it.

896
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,100
Fuck!

897
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:35,500
It's not what you know,
it's what you prove.

898
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:39,170
Here it is.
Mark and Paul kick the door.

899
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,310
Jeff's in first.
Roger fires twice.

900
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,650
What, one go through?

901
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:52,050
-You shot him!
-You fucking shot me, man!

902
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,490
-Don't worry.
-Call an ambulance!

903
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,530
Go to jail, or go home?

904
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:59,960
All right, here's the scenario.

905
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:03,570
Mark and Paul kick the door.
Jeff runs in.

906
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:06,030
Roger opens fire, hits Jeff.

907
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,940
Hoyt is in second,
drops Roger with the shotgun.

908
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,270
-Who shot Roger?
-New guy.

909
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:14,980
-New guy.
-You two?

910
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:18,550
-Hoyt.
-Fuck Hoyt. Ambulance time!

911
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,150
Done. Paul, call them up.

912
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:24,190
1 1 -49. 998. Shots fired.

913
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:27,020
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

914
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:29,630
5951 Baxter Street.

915
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:34,730
Congratulations. You're gonna get
a medal of valor for this.

916
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:37,460
-I didn't shoot him.
-Four cops saw it.

917
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:39,970
But I didn't. You did.

918
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:48,440
"An L.A.P.D. narcotics officer
was killed today...

919
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:51,280
...serving a warrant
in Echo Park."

920
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,010
Give me the bitch.

921
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:00,690
"A spokesperson said
the officer is survived...

922
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,690
...by a wife and child."

923
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,570
There's more. You get the picture?

924
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:08,320
Yeah, I get it.

925
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,000
That's the second time
you pointed a gun at me!

926
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:15,670
Goddamn, boy! That's it, Jake!

927
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,470
Y'all see this?
That's it!

928
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,140
-I'll put a bullet in that melon.
-Wait, wait.

929
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,980
I'm gonna be cool. Drop the gun!

930
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,350
Shoot me.
He's coming with me.

931
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:29,390
-I'll shoot!
-He's a fed.

932
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:34,080
No, he ain't. He's just a kid
that got the drop on y'all.

933
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:38,890
Let's take a deep breath
and just diffuse this. Jake?

934
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,860
I didn't sign up for this!

935
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:45,770
I know you're angry.
Everybody, put the guns down.

936
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:48,530
-Hell, no.
-Choirboy first.

937
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,110
Listen! That's an order!

938
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:53,250
Put them down!

939
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:03,390
Use your ears, Jake.

940
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:06,560
Sometimes we take this shit
all the way.

941
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,280
It's the nature of the business.

942
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:14,400
You'll never have to pull
the trigger again, all right?

943
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,790
-Mark, where are you transferring?
-S.I.S.

944
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,560
Detective.

945
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:23,830
You give me 18 months,
I give you a career.

946
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,940
We make the big seizures, Jake.

947
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:31,310
But if you're in my unit,
you gotta be in it all the way.

948
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,610
I thought you were man enough
to handle this shit.

949
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:38,720
Five decorated officers say
that you shot Roger.

950
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:42,790
They will check your blood
for intoxicants.

951
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,930
What are they gonna find?

952
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:48,900
You've been smoking PCP all day.

953
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:53,000
-You've been planning this all day.
-All week, son.

954
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:56,800
You talk, your blood gets to the lab.

955
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:00,950
You wanna take a walk?
You won't make it out of here.

956
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:03,810
If you're cool, you're a hero.

957
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:06,040
You're above suspicion.

958
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:08,580
Alonzo, there's two shots left.

959
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:12,650
We need to kill him now
and say Roger got him.

960
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,060
No, we ain't killing nobody.

961
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:20,530
This is a good man. I can feel it.

962
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:24,730
Just had a little freak-out,
that's all.

963
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,870
I say he's cool.

964
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,840
Nobody's gonna hurt him.

965
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,310
You do have a decision to make.

966
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:36,810
Because this place is gonna
be overrun with blue suits.

967
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:41,820
So why don't you please
go outside, clear your head.

968
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,720
Or shoot me.

969
01:14:58,670 --> 01:14:59,700
Hey, Paul?

970
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:08,280
You're dead, motherfucker!
You hear me?! Dead!

971
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,090
Well, lay off the device.

972
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,830
All right.

973
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,960
Make sure that tub is clean.

974
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:36,260
All right?

975
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,570
All right, later.

976
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,510
You all right?

977
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:56,910
It behooves you not
to dick around on this one.

978
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,550
Justifiable homicide
in the line of duty.

979
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,820
-Now, what happened--
-What happened was murder.

980
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:06,660
And armed robbery.

981
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,130
We had badges, so it's different?

982
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:12,200
Son, open your eyes! Can't you see?

983
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:17,140
That man was your friend,
and you killed him like a fly.

984
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,110
My friend? Tell me why?

985
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:22,410
Because he knows my first name?

986
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:25,450
This is the game.
I played his ass.

987
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:27,850
That's our job.

988
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:32,960
Roger sold dope to kids.
The world's better off without him.

989
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:39,020
This man was the biggest
major violator in Los Angeles.

990
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:43,670
I watched that cocksucker for years
and now I got him.

991
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:45,840
This is chess, not checkers!

992
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:57,750
What'd you think?
We'd roll up in a black and white?

993
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,980
Slap the cuffs on him?

994
01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:02,180
He's a high roller, dog.

995
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:08,220
-Take the money.
-I'm not taking it.

996
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,900
-Just take it.
-No!

997
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:14,160
Look, I don't give a fuck, but
the boys'll feel better.

998
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:16,700
Fuck their feelings!

999
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,500
Jake, we're a team.

1000
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,670
A team?

1001
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,470
You guys are fucking insane.

1002
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:27,410
I'll go back to the Valley,
I'll cut parking tickets.

1003
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:34,380
-It can't be like this.
-It is.

1004
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,320
I'm sorry, but it is.

1005
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,890
It's ugly, but it's necessary.

1006
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:44,190
I became a cop to put away
dealers and criminals, not to be one.

1007
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,990
You sound just like me.

1008
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:49,270
I know what you're
going through and feeling.

1009
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:50,990
-You're scared.
-I'm not.

1010
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:55,730
Yes, you are. Everyone goes
through that the first time. I did.

1011
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:01,210
The sooner you match
what's in your head...

1012
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:04,210
...with what's in the real world...

1013
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:06,320
...the better you'll feel.

1014
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,180
In this business...

1015
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:12,050
...you gotta have dirt on you
to be trusted.

1016
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:17,550
When all this is behind you, a whole
other world will open up for you.

1017
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:22,330
I walk a higher path, son.

1018
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,400
I have the keys to all the doors.

1019
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:28,440
What do you mean?

1020
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,910
My guys aren't leaders, they're clowns.
You're a leader.

1021
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:34,910
You want my job?
You got it.

1022
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:38,880
You want to lock up poisoners?
This is the place to do it.

1023
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:43,080
But you gotta take your time.

1024
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:46,280
You'll make detective,
you'll grow wise.

1025
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:49,550
And then you can change things.

1026
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,620
But it's gotta be from the inside.

1027
01:19:55,970 --> 01:20:00,670
Let's go downtown to the station.
Talk to my guy, Stan.

1028
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:04,770
He'll go through what you
gotta say to the D.A.

1029
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:57,300
What are we doing now?

1030
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:01,930
I told an informant I'd take care
of his family for him.

1031
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,830
Bring them food, stuff like that.

1032
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,500
Gotta help out the family.

1033
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,450
Believe it or not,
I do try to do some good.

1034
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:21,410
You know where you're at, dog?

1035
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,950
The fuck you looking at?

1036
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:08,700
Hey, we got some things
for the family.

1037
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:23,580
IKitchen's this way.

1038
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,750
Put it on the counter.

1039
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,260
-Where's the head?
-Right through.

1040
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,930
I'm gonna go to the head.
Two seconds, we're gone.

1041
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,140
Hey, let me get the CD player.

1042
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:54,480
No, the CD player's mine.

1043
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,150
Dreamer! Come here!

1044
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,420
Count that shit, all right?

1045
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,820
Thanks a lot, I was busy.

1046
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:07,050
Learn how to count, fucking math whiz.

1047
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:11,590
-You looked!
-I didn't.

1048
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,290
You calling me a cheater, ése?

1049
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:16,190
Deal again, Sniper.

1050
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:21,640
You play cards, cop?

1051
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:23,340
No, not really.

1052
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,800
Want a beer?

1053
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:26,340
Have a cold one.

1054
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:29,010
No, thanks, I'm good.

1055
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:32,950
Come on, sit down.
Play a card game with us.

1056
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:35,850
Don't be rude, ése. You're a guest.

1057
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:38,020
Why don't you play one hand?

1058
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:41,320
Don't worry, we ain't betting money.

1059
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,460
We gotta roll in a second.

1060
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:45,720
Alonzo's taking a shit.

1061
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,530
All right, I'll play one hand.

1062
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:54,410
Is this five-card draw?

1063
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:57,770
Yeah, jokers are wild.

1064
01:23:58,010 --> 01:24:00,540
Why don't you tell us something?

1065
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:03,370
How long you been a pig?

1066
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:06,010
My bad. My bad.

1067
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:09,150
I meant a police officer.

1068
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,580
I've been a pig for 1 9 months.

1069
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,990
Is that right? You like it?

1070
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:17,390
I should've been a fireman.
One more.

1071
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,260
-What you got, dog?
-Three of a kind.

1072
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:25,940
I didn't get shit.

1073
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:28,130
Boo-ya, baby!

1074
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:31,930
Two pair!

1075
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:35,710
What the fuck?

1076
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:38,210
He won.

1077
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:41,540
I got two pair!

1078
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:46,320
Three of a kind beats two pair,
you fucking dumb truck.

1079
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:51,800
You're fucking stupid.
Take your medication.

1080
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:54,400
Seriously. I know I'm number one.

1081
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:59,160
See why we don't play for money?
Because of this vato.

1082
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:02,000
-Show me your cohete.
-What?

1083
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:05,840
Your gun, homes.
Underneath your shirt.

1084
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:08,470
What is it, .380 stainless?

1085
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,410
-9mm Beretta.
-Like that?

1086
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:15,350
-Just like it.
-Yeah?

1087
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,480
Here's the problem.

1088
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,990
I seen this one.
I want to see yours.

1089
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,990
Come on, ése,
I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

1090
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,240
Let me check it out.

1091
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:44,740
Learn that in the Academy?

1092
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:47,750
Neat trick.
This is nice.

1093
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:52,010
Nice.
You could fuck a vato up with this.

1094
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:57,320
What you do is, you aim like that.

1095
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,870
I'm just playing.

1096
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:05,870
Yeah, I gotta go.
Alonzo!

1097
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,930
IKick back and party.

1098
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,740
Ain't nothing out there for you.

1099
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:14,140
What are you talking about?

1100
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,680
Hey, white boy.

1101
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:23,520
If you ask me homes,
that's just, of course, if you ask...

1102
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,750
...Alonzo played you, ése.

1103
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:28,560
Big time.

1104
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:31,290
Wait, where you going?

1105
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:35,300
It's your deal.

1106
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,310
It's all there.

1107
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:50,670
-Sure?
-You can count it yourself.

1108
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,850
Alonzo pulled off a miracle.

1109
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:01,860
Times are tight.
Scared up a lot of cash.

1110
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:04,360
Who'd he jack, homes?

1111
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,160
I don't know.

1112
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:12,400
He jacked Roger.

1113
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,090
Blasted that fool.

1114
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:18,240
Alonzo's a low-down, ruthless vato.

1115
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,310
But I like that.

1116
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:24,980
That's why I never shake his hand.

1117
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,950
He don't respect nada.

1118
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:30,590
IKnow what the money's for?

1119
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:33,850
Alonzo, he's a hothead.

1120
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:37,550
Last week in Vegas, some Russian
starts talking shit.

1121
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,730
Alonzo, he just snapped.

1122
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:43,230
Beat his ass to death.

1123
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:47,130
Turns out, that Russian,
he's a somebody.

1124
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:52,280
Now, Alonzo's into the Russians
for a million.

1125
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,640
How do you know that?

1126
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:01,250
Alonzo has until tonight to pay up.

1127
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:03,980
But he's still on their list.

1128
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,190
Nobody thought he could
get the cash.

1129
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:11,790
Good thing he did.
They're looking for him.

1130
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:18,470
If he don't turn up downtown with
the cash by midnight....

1131
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:20,400
Your vato...

1132
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:22,010
...he's dead.

1133
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,970
Hey, pig.

1134
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:26,700
Ever had your shit pushed in?

1135
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,880
Simple question.

1136
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,310
-No?
-No.

1137
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:33,310
-Had my shit pushed in.
-Yeah, man.

1138
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:37,420
I had my shit pushed in, bro!

1139
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,280
Big time!

1140
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:42,650
Smiley?

1141
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:46,800
Sure, I always get love
from the homeys.

1142
01:28:57,210 --> 01:28:59,070
You guys fucked him up!

1143
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,640
Go next door.

1144
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:03,140
Get the fuck out of here!

1145
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:07,650
You fucked up.

1146
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:09,890
You're under arrest!

1147
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:14,720
For being a cop, dogging me
in the mouth in my own pad.

1148
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:19,090
You got the right
to be bitch-slapped!

1149
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:24,000
Drag him to the tub.

1150
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,900
Punk motherfucker!

1151
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:30,240
Raid his ass!

1152
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:53,860
Do it!

1153
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:55,800
It's gonna be loud.

1154
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:01,940
Let me get his money.

1155
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,300
-Wait.
-Hurry up.

1156
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:13,380
Smiley, check it out.

1157
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:16,080
Is that your little cousin?

1158
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,900
-What's this?
-I found it!

1159
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,730
-Who had it?
-I found it!

1160
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,590
Where?

1161
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,600
I found it in MacArthur Park!
MacArthur Park!

1162
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:40,840
Wait up, I can't even see.

1163
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:42,480
Shut the fuck up!

1164
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,740
Get in your last prayer.

1165
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:46,610
Listen to me, man.

1166
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,480
She was being raped.

1167
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:51,680
Two crackheads were attacking her...

1168
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:54,860
...and I stopped them!
I swear to God!

1169
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:58,930
-You're lying to me!
-I am not lying!

1170
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:01,530
She was being raped!

1171
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:03,100
I stopped them!

1172
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:04,930
Please! I got a kid.

1173
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:08,040
-Shut up, fag!
-Blast his ass.

1174
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:11,870
I have a little girl!

1175
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:13,640
Do it!

1176
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,810
I'm gonna get to the bottom of your
bullshit. She's my cousin, homes.

1177
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:22,010
Ain't right involving her.

1178
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:23,310
You fucked up.

1179
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,020
If you're lying to me...

1180
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:31,860
...l blow your balls off.

1181
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,660
-Hello.
-Hey, Letty.

1182
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:35,860
-What's up?
-Hey, Smiley.

1183
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:38,800
Just doing homework. You want Tony?

1184
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,440
No, I want you.

1185
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,630
-You go to school today?
-Yeah.

1186
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:46,170
-You didn't ditch?
-Nope.

1187
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:49,040
I went to every class. Why?

1188
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:51,150
I heard different.

1189
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,620
Cops talk to you today?

1190
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,560
-No, no.
-All right, Letty...

1191
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,350
...don't bullshit me.

1192
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,320
I got jumped by two crackheads.

1193
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:14,800
-You got jumped?
-I think they wanted to rape me.

1194
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:17,340
But nothing happened, okay?

1195
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,600
Because this cop came.

1196
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:22,080
They almost killed him...

1197
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,370
...but he kicked their ass.

1198
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:25,910
Describe him.

1199
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:31,110
He was a white boy.
He looked real young.

1200
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,950
-You're okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1201
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,520
-Hey, Letty.
-Yeah?

1202
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,020
We're not done.

1203
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,390
Okay.

1204
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,960
What's up?

1205
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,930
You gonna blast him?

1206
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,140
Vato was telling the truth.

1207
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:50,070
Life's a trip, qué no?

1208
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:52,380
This is some trippy shit.

1209
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:09,520
That's for getting my cousin's back.

1210
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:14,460
Cover your head.
You'll mess up my floor.

1211
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:18,290
You know this was just
business, right?

1212
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:23,670
Right?

1213
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,300
Right.

1214
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:44,990
What you doing here?
You know you don't belong here.

1215
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:51,760
-What's up?
-Must be lost, motherfucker!

1216
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:56,230
Gonna need more than that
up in here, boy!

1217
01:35:09,150 --> 01:35:11,340
You got business here, rookie?

1218
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:13,840
I'm here for Alonzo.

1219
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:26,590
Hey. Is your dad home?

1220
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:29,230
-In the bedroom.
-He's in the bedroom?

1221
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:32,060
All right, you wanna open up the door?

1222
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:35,930
Okay. Thanks. You watching TV?

1223
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,900
Yeah, anything good on?

1224
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:50,900
-Do you want me to call my mom?
-No, I don't.

1225
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:53,990
I'll tell you what I want.

1226
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:56,480
Find a good hiding spot.

1227
01:36:56,690 --> 01:36:59,520
Do you have a favorite place to hide?

1228
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:03,950
-The closet.
-In the closet? That's perfect.

1229
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:08,430
Okay, open up the closet.
All right. Good, good.

1230
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:10,860
Can you sit down in there?

1231
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:15,360
All right. Now stay in here
and be very quiet.

1232
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:18,410
I'll be right back. All right?

1233
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,740
It's all good, baby.

1234
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:56,910
You, against the wall.

1235
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:00,410
Move real slow.
Put the money in that bag...

1236
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:04,680
...take your weapons and place them
inside that pillowcase.

1237
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:10,620
Congratulations, son. You made it.

1238
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:13,130
You passed the test. You're a narc.

1239
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:16,820
Put the gun down before you give
her a heart attack.

1240
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,470
I said put the money in that bag.

1241
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:22,800
Place your weapons
inside that pillowcase.

1242
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:26,030
Fuck your appointment
with the Russians.

1243
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,370
Oh, okay.

1244
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,750
Okay. Hand me the pillowcase, baby.

1245
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:34,580
Baby! Hand me the pillowcase.

1246
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:36,780
You're gonna book me?

1247
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:38,710
You smoked the dust.

1248
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:42,860
You ran out, and you're the one
that shot Roger.

1249
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,390
-Here you go.
-And the one on your ankle?

1250
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,660
Want the one in my back pocket too?

1251
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:56,910
One problem: You got no witnesses.

1252
01:38:57,110 --> 01:39:00,910
Who are your witnesses, huh?
Roger? Smiley?

1253
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:02,840
You think they'll help you?

1254
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:08,110
It's not what you know.
It's what you can prove.

1255
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:14,690
What can you prove, huh? Nothing.

1256
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:17,020
-Where's your evidence?
-There.

1257
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:21,830
Oh, shit!

1258
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:29,000
It's on now, Jake.

1259
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,670
Don't move.

1260
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:36,010
Where you at, Jake?

1261
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:38,040
Come on out, dog!

1262
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:54,690
-Ah! I see you.
-Shit!

1263
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:04,040
I'm surgical with this bitch.
How you want it?

1264
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:08,540
That fool in the wheelchair?
How you think he got there?

1265
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:14,180
-Mommy.
-Alonzito!

1266
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,420
You see what I see?

1267
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:23,550
Officer Hoyt, job number one:
Preserve life.

1268
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,490
There's my son. Don't hurt him.

1269
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,890
We're walking out together.

1270
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:50,590
Alonzito! Alonzito!

1271
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:57,720
-You all right?
-I want my mommy.

1272
01:40:57,930 --> 01:40:59,490
I know, I know, I know.

1273
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:02,170
Just sit tight, all right?

1274
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:06,100
It's gonna be all right. I know.

1275
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,170
Shut the fuck up!

1276
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:15,170
All right, let me see your hands!
Where is he?

1277
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:17,540
-The window.
-Come on!

1278
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:20,080
-Get your kid, stay down.
-Alonzito!

1279
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:24,350
Hey, man, you tripping?

1280
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:27,780
It's no fun when the rabbit
has the gun, is it?

1281
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:31,020
My nigga.

1282
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:38,200
Hey, first Damu puts one
in his head...

1283
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,860
...l'll make you a rich man!

1284
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:44,370
Come on now.

1285
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:45,800
Who wanna get paid?

1286
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,170
Who wanna get paid?

1287
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:54,850
They're not like you.

1288
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:58,150
You know what I learned today?

1289
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:03,060
-I'm not like you.
-That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

1290
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:08,300
Good. So, what now? Huh?

1291
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:11,230
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1292
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,340
You gonna bust your cherry
killing a cop?

1293
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:21,740
There it is, Jake.

1294
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:24,570
Hit me.

1295
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:30,280
You never killed nobody before.
It ain't like stepping on ants.

1296
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:32,480
Takes a man to kill.

1297
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:36,250
Are you man enough to kill?

1298
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:39,890
Hit me right there.

1299
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:48,290
Get me, Jake. Get me.
Hit me. Hit me.

1300
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:53,240
You can't do it.
Somebody drop this fool for me.

1301
01:48:10,190 --> 01:48:14,220
You got us twisted.
You got to put your own work in.

1302
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:19,230
-All right. It's like that, Bone?
-It's like that.

1303
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:26,600
Player to player, pimp to pimp.

1304
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:29,710
-I don't believe you'd shoot me.
-Don't do it.

1305
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:34,040
-Don't.
-I don't believe you got it in you.

1306
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:47,890
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1307
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:50,090
You ain't gonna do a thing.

1308
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:53,570
You ain't gonna shoot no cop
in the back.

1309
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:56,940
-Don't do it.
-You know what you'd get?

1310
01:48:57,170 --> 01:49:00,510
The gas chamber.
You know what it smells like?

1311
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:05,080
Pine oil. That's where you headed,
to pine oil heaven.

1312
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,840
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1313
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:11,610
I don't think you got it in you.
I'm gonna go get it.

1314
01:49:13,190 --> 01:49:17,130
Shit! Ah, you motherfucker!

1315
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,550
The next one will kill you.

1316
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,030
Son of a bitch!
You shot me in the ass!

1317
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:24,760
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1318
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:26,460
Okay, okay.

1319
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:30,440
All right. Come on, I need
the money. Give me the money.

1320
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:34,300
-Give me that money!
-It's not gonna happen.

1321
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,800
You gonna take my own money from me?

1322
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:41,710
That's my evidence.
You wanna go to jail or go home?

1323
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:46,080
I wanna go home, Jake.

1324
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:50,930
Give me the money,
and let me go home.

1325
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:54,260
-You wanna go home?
-Yeah, let me go home, Jake.

1326
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:56,700
Give me the money,
and let me go.

1327
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:01,330
Give me the money,
and let me go home, Jake.

1328
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:03,030
That's right, come on.

1329
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,240
You don't deserve this.

1330
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:11,050
Okay, motherfucker.

1331
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:18,720
Jake, go and bounce, homey.

1332
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:21,980
Get up out of here. We got your back.

1333
01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:24,120
What?

1334
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,060
-It's like that.
-Oh, no, you didn't!

1335
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:30,960
Wait a minute! No, you--
Hey, hey, Jake!

1336
01:50:31,170 --> 01:50:34,700
Hey! Jake! Jake!

1337
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:36,900
Jake, come back here!

1338
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:39,470
Jake!

1339
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:45,380
You disloyal, fool-ass,
bitch-made punk.

1340
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:49,450
I need my money!

1341
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,360
Jake!

1342
01:50:56,260 --> 01:51:00,090
Oh, you motherfuckers! Okay.

1343
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,990
All right! I'm putting cases
on all you bitches!

1344
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:07,570
Huh? You think you can do this shit?
Jake!

1345
01:51:08,410 --> 01:51:10,770
You think you can do this to me?!

1346
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:15,700
You motherfuckers will be playing
basketball in Pelican Bay...

1347
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:18,250
...when I get finished with you!

1348
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,940
Shoe program, nigga!

1349
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:23,880
Twenty-three hour lock-down!

1350
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:26,180
I'm the man up in this piece!

1351
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:29,880
Who you think you fucking with?!

1352
01:51:30,090 --> 01:51:34,790
I'm the police! I run shit here!
You just live here!

1353
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:38,490
That's right, you better walk away.

1354
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:41,400
I'm gonna burn this motherfucker down!

1355
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:45,770
IKing IKong ain't got shit on me!

1356
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,320
That's all right. That's all right.

1357
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,580
Shit, I don't fuck--

1358
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:06,060
I'm winning anyway. I'm winning.

1359
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,860
I'm winning anyway. I can't lose.

1360
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:14,600
Shit, you can shoot me,
but you can't kill me.

1361
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:23,040
Oh, what a day.

1362
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:25,370
What a motherfucking day!

1363
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:26,530
An L.A. police officer
was killed today...

1364
01:55:26,730 --> 01:55:29,360
...serving a warrant near LAX.

1365
01:55:29,570 --> 01:55:32,930
An L.A.P.D. spokesperson
said Officer Harris...

1366
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:36,230
... was survived by his wife
and four sons.

1367
01:55:36,810 --> 01:55:41,240
The highly decorated officer,
a 13-year L.A.P.D. veteran....
