1
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,523
<i>The way I figure it,
everyone gets a miracle.</i>

2
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,964
<i>Like, maybe you hit
the Powerball jackpot.</i>

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,363
<i>Or a last-second jumper
in the NBA Finals.</i>

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,609
<i>Maybe you make it
to outer space...</i>

5
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,967
<i>or marry the Queen of England,
or something.</i>

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,168
<i>If you consider
all the unlikely things</i>

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,611
<i>that happen in all the world...</i>

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,364
<i>you gotta think
at least one of them</i>

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,090
<i>will happen to each of us.</i>

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,843
<i>Turns out,
my miracle was different.</i>

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,445
<i>Of all the houses</i>

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,001
<i>in all the subdivisions
in all the state of Florida...</i>

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,242
<i>I wound up living
across the street...</i>

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,802
<i>from Margo Roth Spiegelman.</i>

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,851
<i>Bring your own lampshade,
somewhere there's a party</i>

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,130
<i>Here it's never endin',
can't remember when it started</i>

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,850
<i>Pass around the lampshade,</i>

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,809
<i>There'll be plenty enough
room in jail</i>

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,325
<i>From the
moment I saw her...</i>

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,205
<i>I was hopelessly,
madly in love.</i>

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,084
<i>If bein' wrong's a crime,
I'm serving forever</i>

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,924
<i>If bein' strong's your kind</i>

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,527
<i>Then I need help here
with this feather</i>

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,165
<i>Due to our
close proximity</i>

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,924
<i>in both age and location...</i>

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,248
<i>and for no other reason
I could ever discern...</i>

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,562
<i>we soon became friends.</i>

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,168
<i>If bein' afraid is a crime
we hang side by side</i>

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,089
<i>At the swingin' party
down the line</i>

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,326
Look.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,525
Quentin.

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,445
He's dead.

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,482
We should get out
of here, Margo.

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
I thought you closed
your eyes when you died.

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,401
<i>The truth is...</i>

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,528
<i>at the time,
it didn't feel like</i>

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,806
<i>that big a deal to me.</i>

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,287
<i>It's not like I knew the guy.</i>

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,445
<i>If I had a panic attack</i>

40
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,443
<i>every time someone
I didn't know died...</i>

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,250
<i>I'd go insane.</i>

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,243
<i>It was a much
bigger deal to Margo.</i>

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,881
I figured it out.

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,886
His name is Robert Joyner.

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,041
He was 36.

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,247
Apparently he was
getting divorced

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,407
and he was sad about it.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,971
How do you know all this?

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,521
I'm doing an investigation.
Are you in?

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,241
Sure.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,562
Great. Come on.
Wait, what?

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,881
His wife works at SeaWorld.

53
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,724
I bet there's a clue.

54
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,041
Margo...

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,804
we can't go to SeaWorld.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,047
It's almost 11:00.

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,247
I can get us in.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,526
Come on!

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,289
I don't wanna get in trouble.

60
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,882
It's a shame,
don't you think?

61
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,850
All those strings
inside him broke.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,280
<i>Margo always loved mysteries.</i>

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,647
<i>And in everything
that came after,</i>

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,370
<i>I could never stop thinking...</i>

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,727
<i>maybe she
loved them so much...</i>

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,969
<i>she became one.</i>

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,091
<i>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

68
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,246
<i>A lot changed
in the years that followed.</i>

69
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,881
<i>Margo and I sort of...
drifted apart.</i>

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,529
<i>But I never stopped
thinking about her...</i>

71
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,887
I'll get it! I'll get it.

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,409
<i>...and hoping
I'd get a second chance.</i>

73
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,206
Trick or treat!

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,882
Yeah.
Happy Halloween, guys.

75
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,126
<i>It wasn't just me.</i>

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,170
<i>Pretty much
everyone recognized...</i>

77
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,050
<i>Margo was different.</i>

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,722
<i>Margo was...</i>

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,244
<i>special.</i>

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,088
<i>Her life had become a series</i>

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,811
<i>of unbelievably epic adventures.</i>

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,441
<i>Each one
too insane to be true.</i>

83
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,565
<i>Like the time
she spent three weeks</i>

84
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,404
<i>traveling with the circus.</i>

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,202
<i>Or the time she toured
with the Mallionaires</i>

86
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,360
<i>up and down the East Coast.</i>

87
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,851
Look, if you ask
the bassist...

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,809
he's either gonna say
I'm his girlfriend

89
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,881
or he wants me to be...

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,928
Either way
I'm going back there...

91
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,650
so you might as well
make it easier for yourself

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,721
and just let me in.

93
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,889
<i>And wherever she went...</i>

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,604
<i>she always left clues behind
for her little sister, Ruthie.</i>

95
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,288
<i>Or anyone else
she deemed worthy.</i>

96
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,483
<i>I was never
one of those people.</i>

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,447
<i>As senior year
drew to a close,</i>

98
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,329
<i>Margo and I
barely talked at all.</i>

99
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,563
It's your senior prom.

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,011
I don't understand
the objection.

101
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,447
I have so many
objections, Mom.

102
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,641
Like slow dancing.

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,200
And fast dancing.
Any kind of dancing.

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,651
And wearing a rented tux.

105
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,370
You could take Suzie Chung.

106
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,289
No, we're not
a thing anymore.

107
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,246
But she was such a nice girl.
What happened with you two?

108
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,329
I don't know, it just...

109
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,649
Just didn't work out.

110
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,727
Hi, Ben. Hi, Radar.

111
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,644
Hi, Mrs. Jacobsen.
Hey, Mrs. Jacobsen.

112
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,929
I would hit that so hard.

113
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,606
I don't see it.

114
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,841
What? Q!

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,889
I'm not saying
I just wanna bang your mom.

116
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,371
She should be respected.
Stop.

117
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,921
Admired. You know,
she's a real lady.

118
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,889
Yeah, she's my mom.

119
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,849
I wanna ride bikes with her.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,081
What?

121
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,887
I'd feed her grapes,
take her to Paris.

122
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,883
Treat her like the princess she is.
What, is that wrong?

123
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,087
It's weird.

124
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,844
It's always weird.

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,044
I wanna give her a bath.

126
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,246
That's gonna be so...

127
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,164
Oh! Hold on.

128
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,605
Uh-oh.

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,810
Hey, honey bunny.
How's prom looking for you?

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,729
Not a chance, Bloody Ben.

131
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,849
No.

132
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,806
No!

133
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,523
Freshmen know that story?

134
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,046
<i>When Ben was 12...</i>

135
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,406
<i>he got a kidney infection</i>

136
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,086
<i>and started literally pissing blood.</i>
Oh, God.

137
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,000
<i>By the time he came
back from the hospital...</i>

138
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,770
<i>a rumor had spread through
the entire school...</i>

139
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,410
<i>that his condition
was the result</i>

140
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,084
<i>of chronic masturbation.</i>

141
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,768
I'm never gonna
get a prom date, am I?

142
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,921
Don't worry about it.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,764
Prom is a waste of time
and a waste of money.

144
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
Radar's going to prom.

145
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,243
Radar has a girlfriend,
so he has to go to prom.

146
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,686
Lame.

147
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,602
Radar, has she
been to your house yet?

148
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,127
Oh, yeah. Has your girlfriend
come to your house yet?

149
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,725
Stop.
Isn't there a certain reason

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,801
why she doesn't
come to your house?

151
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,001
Radar, what up with that?

152
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,411
You know very well
"what up with that."

153
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,720
We just like
to hear you say it.

154
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,285
Could you tell us again?

155
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,521
Because of what?
I cannot hear you.

156
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,601
Can you project?

157
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,000
My parents own

158
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,082
The world's largest collection
of black Santas!

159
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,241
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

160
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,731
<i>You heard that correctly.</i>

161
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,530
<i>Radar's parents
were trying to get into</i>

162
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,840
<i>The Guinness Book
of World Records...</i>

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,844
<i>for the largest collection
of black Santas in one house.</i>

164
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,410
<i>There were over a thousand.</i>

165
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,405
<i>And they were everywhere.</i>

166
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,649
<i>And not just at Christmas.</i>

167
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,201
<i>Even so, Radar was
the first one of us</i>

168
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,169
<i>to get a serious girlfriend.</i>

169
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,801
You need a prom date.

170
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,928
Why don't you ask that girl
you slept with at summer camp?

171
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,201
Oh. She's made up.

172
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
No, she's not.

173
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,523
But you can ask the girl
from Saskatchewan.

174
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,364
Oh, yeah, you could ask...
Oh, no, she's also made up.

175
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,648
No, they are both real.
Not made up.

176
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,126
Define "real."
I don't know.

177
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,281
Gotta go.

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,321
Hi.
Hey.

179
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,051
Hey. Let's go.
We have 10 minutes.

180
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,406
No, we're fine. Let's go.

181
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,726
Hi, Angela.

182
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,887
Bye, Angela.

183
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,121
It was nice
talking to you, Angela.

184
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,326
Oh, God. She's great.

185
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,560
Glad we can
have these chats.

186
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,201
<i>So most of my days
were exactly like this.</i>

187
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,687
<i>I threw myself
into my classes...</i>

188
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,690
<i>SATs, extracurriculars.</i>

189
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,809
<i>By the end of high school...</i>

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,769
<i>I barely
thought of her at all.</i>

191
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,331
<i>I just had to graduate,
go off to college,</i>

192
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,640
<i>find someone new.</i>

193
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,330
<i>And forget the miracle
ever happened.</i>

194
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,322
<i>And it almost
worked out that way.</i>

195
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,724
<i>Until this one night.</i>

196
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,361
Margo?

197
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,641
Shh.

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,490
Margo, hey.

199
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,165
I need to borrow your car.

200
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,606
What?
Your car.

201
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,006
I don't have a car.

202
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,446
I mean your mom's car.

203
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,926
Why can't you use your car?

204
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,923
My parents locked
the keys in the safe

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,047
beneath their bed.

206
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,565
And while I'm sure
I could go in there

207
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,687
and crack the combo...

208
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,841
it just so happens that

209
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,967
Myrna Mountweazel's in there...

210
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,088
and that goddamn dog
despises me.

211
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,925
Anyway, so like I said,
I need to borrow your car.

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,001
Mmm-mmm.

213
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,162
Also, I need you
to drive the car...

214
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,448
because I have nine things
I need to do tonight...

215
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,887
and more than half of them
require a getaway driver.

216
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,447
What, are you
committing felonies?

217
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,364
Ooh. Remind me, is breaking
and entering a felony?

218
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,487
Yes. What?

219
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,686
- Well.
- Margo!

220
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,761
Okay.

221
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,769
I gotta go,
so are you in or out?

222
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,961
Why can't you just get

223
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,087
one of your underlings
to help you out?

224
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,320
Like Jase,
or Lacey, or Becca?

225
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,044
They're part
of the problem, actually.

226
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,326
What problem?

227
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,050
There are nine problems.

228
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,891
And your boyfriend's
one of them?

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,525
Ex-boyfriend.

230
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,082
Hmm.

231
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,401
Do you care to tell me
where we're going?

232
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,764
Uh, first,
we are going to BJ's.

233
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,645
We're going shopping?

234
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,486
No, we're not going shopping.

235
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,041
We are righting wrongs.
Then after that...

236
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,929
we're gonna wrong some rights.

237
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,769
Basically, this is gonna be
the best night of your life.

238
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,125
Okay.

239
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,002
I really don't wanna
get into trouble.

240
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,728
You're a very anxious person,
aren't you, Q?

241
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,405
I'm not an anxious person.
I just...

242
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,244
I have plans and goals.

243
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,046
None of which
involve jail or dying.

244
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,526
Pull in here.

245
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,047
So, what plans?
Huh?

246
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,085
You said you had plans.

247
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,124
Uh... I just meant I'm going
to Duke in the fall...

248
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,964
then go to med school
and become an oncologist...

249
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,407
and obviously...

250
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,881
get married
and have kids by 30.

251
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,928
And then you'll be happy?
Huh?

252
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,366
When you're 30 in 12 years.

253
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,682
Married, kids, career.

254
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,565
Then you'll be happy.

255
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,324
Is that actually
what you're saying?

256
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,401
Um...

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,965
Yeah. I guess. Yeah.

258
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,160
Isn't there something
that could make you happy now?

259
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,889
Like, that's the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

260
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,241
Bingo!

261
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,164
Nair? Wait,
why do you need Nair?

262
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
All will be revealed shortly,
my young friend.

263
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,803
Six months older than you.
Remember that?

264
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,166
Oh, really? Are you?

265
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,321
Margo, don't.

266
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,811
Stop, stop! Don't.

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,001
It's really loud.
Don't. Stop.

268
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,162
What? Were you
trying to say something?

269
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,526
You can't do that.
Shh.

270
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,889
Stop, stop!

271
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,280
What else do we need?

272
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,648
Interesting capitalization.

273
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,770
I'm a big believer
in random capitalization.

274
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,202
The rules are so unfair
to the letters in the middle.

275
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,284
It's not as weird
as it looks.

276
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,805
Still weird.

277
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,325
So what happened?

278
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,729
With Jase and Lacey and Becca?

279
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,242
Apparently, my boyfriend
of lo, these many months...

280
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,849
has been cheating on me.

281
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,921
What?

282
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,240
With one of my best friends.

283
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,401
Seriously?

284
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,328
Why would he do that?

285
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,681
Oh, next left.

286
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,205
Wait, this is...

287
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,930
This is Becca's house.

288
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,610
Yeah.

289
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,127
And there is Jase's car.

290
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,281
Margo, this is a bad idea.

291
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,965
No, Quentin.

292
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,602
This is a tremendous idea.

293
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,124
Margo. Margo.

294
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,450
Idiot never locks his car.

295
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,045
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

296
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,441
The Margo Roth Spiegelman
revenge plot begins.

297
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,041
Do you wanna do the honors?

298
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,241
No.

299
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,731
Suit yourself.

300
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,445
I can't believe
you just did that.

301
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,328
We bring the rain down
on our enemies.

302
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,441
"We"?

303
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,925
You'll see.

304
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,608
Hello, is this Mr. Arrington?

305
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,165
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

306
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,924
I'm so sorry,
but I just thought

307
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,081
you'd like to know

308
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,764
that your daughter is having sex

309
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,002
in your basement right now.

310
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,650
Goodbye.

311
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,004
What was that voice?
Let me use your phone.

312
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,161
Quickly.

313
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,841
Here.

314
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,606
Get in position.

315
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,171
What do you mean?
What do I do?

316
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,000
Four...

317
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,361
Three...

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,001
Two...

319
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,966
Take the picture, now!

320
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,441
Go!

321
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,600
Watch this.

322
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,846
What?

323
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,171
Well, that was fun.

324
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,651
He totally saw me.

325
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,041
What? So?

326
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,725
So, he could kick my ass.

327
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,881
He won't.

328
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,690
What makes you so sure?

329
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,565
Let me see.

330
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,321
What?

331
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,564
The Rhode Island of penises.

332
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,728
It may have
an illustrious history...

333
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,530
but it sure isn't big.

334
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,245
Okay. Now we go inside.

335
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,243
No. What? No, no.

336
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,280
This fish is for Becca
and it goes in her house.

337
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,004
No, no. Come on, Margo.
We're gonna get caught.

338
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,241
We can't go inside.

339
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,925
I'll be lookout.

340
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,401
You can do
whatever you want, Q.

341
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,161
Damn it.

342
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,321
What the hell was that?

343
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,771
Dad, I'm sorry, okay?

344
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,841
"I'm sorry"?

345
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,160
That's completely unacceptable.

346
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,611
I really like him, Dad!

347
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,681
He does not love you!

348
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,761
Yes, he does!

349
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,040
Who's down there?

350
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,570
Go, go, go.

351
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,289
I have a gun!

352
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,486
- Shit!
- Are you kidding?

353
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,801
Yeah, run!

354
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,120
Couldn't you have just thrown it
through a window or something?

355
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,170
We bring the rain,
not the scattered showers.

356
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,722
That was fun.
That was pretty fun.

357
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,650
Yeah.

358
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,846
You Okay?

359
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,001
Yeah.

360
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,084
I don't know.

361
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,491
I just thought
maybe it wasn't true.

362
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,161
Ah.

363
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,002
Anyway, moving on.

364
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,810
Lacey's?

365
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,127
Has Lacey
been naughty or nice?

366
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,965
Lacey has been
distinctly naughty.

367
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,284
We've been best friends
since the 5th grade.

368
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,771
And then?

369
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,004
And then,
she didn't tell me about Jase.

370
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,206
Ready?

371
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,521
Ta-da!

372
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,041
Nice.

373
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,688
<i>Unsentimental</i>

374
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,731
<i>Traveling around</i>

375
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,722
Oh, my God, it's so late.

376
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,401
If you're tired,
we can go home.

377
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,330
I thought so.

378
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,164
<i>In the aisles of the grocery</i>

379
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,561
<i>And the blocks uptown</i>

380
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,251
Who lives here?

381
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,246
Chuck Parson.

382
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,926
Chuck Parson?

383
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,960
You didn't think a scumbag
like Chuck Parson

384
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,610
could emerge
unscathed, did you?

385
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,008
He's Jase's best friend.
He's an accomplice.

386
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,924
Uh...

387
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,120
Don't worry.

388
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,244
He's a heavy sleeper.

389
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,447
Don't, don't, don't.

390
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,965
The 6th-grade dance?

391
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,641
Hmm?

392
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,731
Chuck told all the girls not to dance
with you and we all went along with it.

393
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,330
All of us.

394
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,161
I'm really sorry, Quentin.

395
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,321
No, it's okay.

396
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,970
That was a...

397
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,404
That was a long time ago.

398
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,161
Here.

399
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,325
No, thanks.

400
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,448
There's gonna come a time
in your life...

401
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,568
where you're gonna look back
on this moment...

402
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,329
and you're gonna think...

403
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,171
"What do I regret more?

404
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,647
"Removing Chuck's eyebrow...

405
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,366
"or not removing
Chuck's eyebrow?"

406
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,530
All right, give it to me.

407
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,640
What the...?

408
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,765
Look at us. We're ninjas!

409
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,400
Maybe you're a ninja.
I'm not a ninja.

410
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,370
You're a ninja too.
Just a really awkward one.

411
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,124
I can feel my heart
beating in my chest.

412
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,601
That's how you know
you're having fun.

413
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,088
Okay. So what's this about?

414
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,641
Come on.

415
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,643
Well, at the end
of a grand adventure...

416
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,122
one must pause and reflect
on one's achievements.

417
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,291
And the best place
in Orlando to do that...

418
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,646
is the SunTrust building.

419
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,768
Stop.
What?

420
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,325
Stop it.
What?

421
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,130
You promised me
no breaking and entering.

422
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,362
We're not breaking and entering.

423
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,170
We're just entering.

424
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,481
Very clever.

425
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,007
I can't get arrested
tonight. Or ever.

426
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,685
You won't!

427
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,240
It's the SunTrust building.

428
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,845
There's gotta be
a guard or something.

429
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,082
Well, of course there is.

430
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,330
His name's Gus.

431
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,922
- You know the name of the...
- Yep.

432
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,001
Of course you do. Yeah,

433
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,320
you know the name of the guard.

434
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,684
- Hey, Margo.
- Hey, Gus.

435
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,002
Do you mind
if we go upstairs for a bit?

436
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,328
<i>- Mi casa es su casa.</i>
- Cool.

437
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,641
Who's the kid?

438
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,370
It's Q.
Me?

439
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,762
I'm six months older than her.

440
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,284
Welcome to my office.

441
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,806
Nice music.

442
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,361
Soothing sounds
of corporate America.

443
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,890
Whoa!

444
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,566
Come here.

445
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,367
Okay, so, over there
is Jefferson Park.

446
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,841
Mmm-hmm.

447
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,841
All the lights are off,
so that's good.

448
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,651
And over here is Chuck's house.

449
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,802
No lights, no cops.

450
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,684
Seems quiet.

451
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,084
I think we're in the clear.

452
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,891
It's beautiful.

453
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,845
You think so?

454
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,001
Uh...

455
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,849
From a distance, I mean.

456
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,206
Yeah.

457
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,763
Everything's uglier up close.

458
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,925
Not you.

459
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,441
It's a paper town.

460
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,761
Hmm?

461
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,491
Look at it.

462
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,008
All those paper houses
and paper streets and...

463
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,922
And the people, too.

464
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,891
I've lived here 11 years...

465
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,281
and I've never
come across anyone

466
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,880
that cares about
anything that matters.

467
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,211
Okay, I'll try not
to take that personally.

468
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,563
Here's a tip, Quentin.

469
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,041
You're cute
when you're confident.

470
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,722
Less when you're not.

471
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,321
Hey.

472
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,844
May I have this dance?

473
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,684
You owe me one.

474
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,364
Maybe things
would have been different...

475
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,761
if I'd hung out with you
this whole time.

476
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,169
It's not too late.

477
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,485
Whoa!

478
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,081
Hey, Margo.

479
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,328
What happens now?

480
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,721
Will things be different...

481
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,525
tomorrow?

482
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,765
I really hope so.

483
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,763
Yeah?
Yeah.

484
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,089
Me, too.

485
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,282
Okay, you see this?

486
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,966
This is your comfort zone.

487
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,089
It's this big, Quentin.

488
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,084
All the things
that you want in the world...

489
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,969
are way out there.

490
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,805
The way you felt tonight...

491
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,291
that is the way
you should feel

492
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,805
your whole life.

493
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,481
All right.

494
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,971
See you.

495
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,011
Hey.

496
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,851
Hey!

497
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,443
Morning, sleepyhead.

498
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,204
Been trying to wake you
for 20 minutes.

499
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,800
Some dream
you must have been having.

500
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,645
Getting you a date
to prom is so hard

501
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,848
that the hypothetical
idea itself...

502
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,126
is used to cut diamonds.

503
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,680
That's a good one.

504
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,641
Q.

505
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,881
What are you doing?

506
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,041
What?

507
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,521
Nothing.

508
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,049
That was so weird.

509
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,646
I know it was you!

510
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,245
Relax, relax.
Yo, don't tell me to relax!

511
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,520
I know it was you at Becca's!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

512
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,760
Are you sure
you wanna do that?

513
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,767
I mean...

514
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,408
Even if I enlarge it...

515
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,000
Put that away.

516
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,921
Wow.

517
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,690
I'm sorry. This is the part
where I get confused.

518
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,968
You did not hook up
with Margo Roth Spiegelman?

519
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,531
No, we did not hook up.

520
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,367
What?

521
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,646
I'm so confused.

522
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,886
What is wrong with you?

523
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,122
Me? What's wrong with you, bro?

524
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,328
Margo Roth Spiegelman,
2:00 a.m., she's single...

525
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,482
she's dancing, it's dark.

526
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,404
And you don't make the move.
I don't understand that.

527
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,642
It's not even
like that. It's like...

528
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,286
I don't know.
We were connecting.

529
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,129
We were on a mission.
It was different.

530
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,206
So now what?

531
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,125
I don't know.

532
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,970
I'll let you know
when I see her.

533
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,007
You need aglets.
You need aglets to exist.

534
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,481
I get that you need them.
But to exist?

535
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,051
<i>But Margo never
made it to school that day.</i>

536
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,802
<i>Or the next day.</i>

537
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,531
<i>Or the day after that.</i>

538
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,682
Guy heard her singing
karaoke in the mall.

539
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,650
Next thing you know,
she's signed to his label.

540
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,211
She's in New York right now,
recording an album.

541
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,486
I know for a fact
she's in Iceland,

542
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,800
saving the whales.

543
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,201
No, it wasn't Iceland.
It was Greenland.

544
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,845
Where did you hear that?

545
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,321
<i>Like everyone else,
I started to wonder...</i>

546
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,528
<i>"Where the hell was she?"</i>

547
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,730
<i>What was she doing?</i>

548
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,850
<i>Who was she with?</i>

549
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,570
<i>Why wasn't it me?</i>

550
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,526
I know this is
a difficult situation for you.

551
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,328
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Spiegelman.

552
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,050
Hello, Quentin.

553
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,202
This is Detective Warren.

554
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,085
Sounds like Margo's
run away again.

555
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,447
For the fifth time.

556
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,011
Deb.
What?

557
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,571
Hank, I am tired of this.

558
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,166
She's 18.
Let her do what she wants.

559
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,287
What do you know about it?

560
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,403
Hmm? Me?
Yeah.

561
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,000
When was the last time
you saw Margo?

562
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,721
Uh...

563
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,561
It was Wednesday, I think.
Yeah, Wednesday night.

564
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,120
She came to my window
and we talked

565
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,526
for a second
and then she left.

566
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,687
You guys don't think...

567
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,689
something happened to her,
or anything, right?

568
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,800
We know exactly what's happened.

569
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,401
She's bored.

570
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,925
She wants attention.

571
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,411
She'll come back
when she runs out of money...

572
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,767
or when people
stop talking about her.

573
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,848
So you don't wanna
file a missing persons report?

574
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,765
She's not missing. She's gone.

575
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,686
There's a difference.

576
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,009
<i>Yeah.
Not your top candidates</i>

577
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,570
<i>for parents of the year.</i>

578
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,245
<i>But they weren't wrong
about one thing.</i>

579
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,009
<i>If she was gone...</i>

580
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,924
<i>she wouldn't be found
until she wanted to be.</i>

581
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,440
Yeah, whatever, bro.
She left town.

582
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,130
There's plenty other honey
bunnies in the sea.

583
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,691
What, like Fattina?

584
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,364
Uh... Ha-ha!

585
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,885
Not "Fattina."
It's "Bettina."

586
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,684
Doesn't even sound like a real name.
Yeah.

587
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,761
What was her last name?

588
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,888
I don't know.
Just say her last name.

589
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,610
Three, two, one.

590
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,364
It was a one hit, and a quit.

591
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,126
It was a "hit it and quit it"?
Yeah. I hit that honey bunny.

592
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,611
I've told you guys this
so many times.

593
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,761
I don't wanna
go over this again.

594
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,887
Tell us.
I wanna hear it again.

595
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,121
Cousin's house.

596
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,725
Right, Bettina was
your cousin. I forgot.

597
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,450
No! Bettina was
not my cousin!

598
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,722
You slept with your cousin.
Not my cousin.

599
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,644
It's so hard when
you wanna sleep

600
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,881
with someone
that's not in your family.

601
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,961
No!

602
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,160
"Man, I slept with someone in my family."
No, no, no.

603
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,651
I just feel if we're gonna

604
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,285
validate the story,
could we get a couple details?

605
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,891
All right,
I'll give it to you straight.

606
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,168
So, I'm in Saskatchewan.

607
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,481
My cousin Danny's like,

608
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,800
"Yo, Ben,
I'm throwing a party."

609
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,769
I'm like, "Yo, what's up?
Let's do it."

610
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,809
So, he throws a party.
Bettina comes over, looks at me.

611
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,321
She's like,
"What?" We go upstairs...

612
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,084
So, she's making strange noises?

613
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,324
No, she's making a call.

614
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,845
Like a bird
makes to another bird.

615
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
So you walked in,

616
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,081
and Bettina went...

617
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,924
Mating time, bro.
Mating time.

618
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,684
Just say something true.

619
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,360
What do you mean,
"Say something true"?

620
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,811
Just say anything true.

621
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,166
I'm saying all this is true.

622
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,287
I so don't believe you.

623
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,121
It's true!

624
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,691
What, you don't believe me?

625
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,001
No, no.

626
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,525
That's fine. Go poop.

627
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,322
Shut up! Shut up.

628
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,290
We're not even talking about me.

629
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,089
We're talking about
you and Angela.

630
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,200
Little honey bunny.
Don't call her "honey bunny."

631
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,687
You gonna tap that ass, son?
Don't call me "son."

632
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,490
When you gonna get up in it?
Don't say "tap that ass."

633
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,290
Do a little dance for her.
Stop.

634
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,204
Show her what you're
working with. Come on.

635
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,524
If you must know, we're...

636
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,886
We're waiting till prom.

637
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,281
Why?

638
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,887
Because we want it
to be special.

639
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,326
Radar, that's
so beautiful. I think...

640
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,123
I think I wanna be with you.

641
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,727
Stop.

642
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,041
Hey, guys.
Stop.

643
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,406
Hey, guys.

644
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,561
What?

645
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,041
There's something
in Margo's window.

646
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,530
Has that thing
always been there?

647
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,520
I don't know.
The shade's never drawn.

648
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,644
"Woody Guthrie,
folk singer.

649
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,326
"Born 1912. Died 1967."

650
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,925
<i>Come and sit by my side,
if you love me</i>

651
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,769
It's looking right at you, Q.

652
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,010
<i>Do not hasten
to bid me adieu</i>

653
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,320
I know.

654
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,090
Hey, Ruthie.
Hey, Quentin.

655
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,402
Your parents
aren't home, are they?

656
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,607
No, they went to the mall.

657
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,000
Would it be cool if we went up
to Margo's room for a sec?

658
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,601
Why?

659
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,489
Just wanted to check
on something.

660
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,324
Margo doesn't like
people in her room.

661
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,090
Okay, but we're her friends.

662
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,123
No, you're not.
And, if you were...

663
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,760
you'd know she doesn't like
people in her room.

664
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,804
She has every album ever made,
except Woody Guthrie.

665
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,921
Up.

666
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,201
Sorry.

667
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,081
Mind if I...

668
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,484
Don't even think about it.

669
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,120
What are you guys
even looking for anyway?

670
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,123
We don't really know.

671
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,486
Clues.

672
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,650
We're detectives.

673
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,571
Hey, look.

674
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,325
Holy shit-stickers.

675
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,321
What do we got?

676
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,600
"Walt Whitman's Niece," circled.

677
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,244
What do you think it means?
Oh! Wait.

678
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,441
What?

679
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,001
I think she's
sending you a message.

680
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,366
What message?

681
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,970
"Come find me."

682
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,570
<i>Last night or the night
before that</i>

683
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,642
<i>I won't say which night</i>

684
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,731
<i>A seaman friend of mine</i>

685
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,965
<i>I'll not say which seaman</i>

686
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,284
<i>Walked up
to a big old building</i>

687
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,087
<i>I won't say which building</i>

688
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,045
<i>And would not have
walked up the stairs</i>

689
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,369
<i>Not to say which stairs</i>

690
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,084
<i>If there had not
have been two girls</i>

691
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,843
<i>It's a call to arms.</i>

692
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,566
It's a way of her saying...

693
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,690
"Take a risk, asshole.
Stop playing it so safe."

694
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,002
Maybe that's what she's
been trying to tell me the whole time...

695
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,485
like with the
paper towns thing.

696
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,641
She's like...

697
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,846
"I'm making a move, Q.

698
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,571
"I'm going after it.
Come with me."

699
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,840
So, if you crack the code
and find out where she is...

700
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,570
Can I talk to you?

701
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,005
Hi, Lacey.

702
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,282
You were with her
that night, right?

703
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,568
The night with the Saran Wrap?

704
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,921
Yeah.

705
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,642
Was she mad at me?

706
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,689
Nah, she was...

707
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,880
disappointed.

708
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,371
In what? What did I do?

709
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,244
That you knew about
Becca and Jase.

710
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,488
No, see, that...
That's the thing.

711
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,680
I had no idea. If I knew,
I would've said something.

712
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,165
Okay, Margo
seemed to think that...

713
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,281
She's wrong.

714
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,248
Yeah, I believe you.

715
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,166
It's just,
Chuck knew this whole time,

716
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,287
which is awesome.

717
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,205
So, now we're broken up...

718
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,407
and I don't have
a date to prom

719
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,527
the week before prom...

720
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,728
and my best friend is off
doing God knows what...

721
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,967
thinking that I betrayed her,

722
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,644
which is something
I would never do.

723
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,925
I'm sorry
to tell all of that to you.

724
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,286
No, it's okay.

725
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,606
I'm sorry, what did
you say about prom?

726
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,881
Something about a date?

727
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,045
If you hear from her,
will you tell me?

728
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,929
Why would I hear from her?

729
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,004
You were with her that night.
Her last night.

730
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,889
It has to mean something.

731
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,840
See you, guys.

732
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,131
That was the greatest
30 seconds of my life.

733
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,960
<i>Walt Whitman's from New York.</i>

734
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,240
<i>Woody Guthrie
lived in New York for a while.</i>

735
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,401
Maybe that's something.

736
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,240
You think she's in New York?
It's possible.

737
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,804
Did she ever
mention New York or...

738
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,520
No, she didn't
mention New York to me...

739
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,204
but I didn't talk to her
for nine years, so that's...

740
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,407
Yeah, that's true.

741
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,050
I'm taking Lacey to prom.

742
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,884
What?
You're what?

743
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,327
You guys didn't see it?

744
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,610
We had a moment back there.

745
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,930
Must've missed that.

746
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,368
"Unscrew the locks
from the doors."

747
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,521
It's a metaphor.

748
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,364
But what if it isn't?

749
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,809
What if it's instructions?

750
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,921
Hmm.

751
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,604
I thought there'd be a...

752
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,410
Just put it back.

753
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,843
Gravity to the second power.

754
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,881
Yep.

755
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,611
Radar, what are you
up to tonight?

756
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,082
<i>I promised Angela
I'd take her shoe shopping.</i>

757
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,446
Shoe shopping?

758
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,886
Yeah, she decided today

759
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,371
that she doesn't like
the prom shoes she bought...

760
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,010
<i>so I'm taking her to the mall</i>

761
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,606
while their Midnight Madness
sale is still going on.

762
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,843
It's a pretty good sale
they got going on.

763
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,921
<i>Radar, Radar, Radar.</i>

764
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,321
I found something.

765
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,921
What?

766
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,086
An address.

767
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,289
It wasn't in Margo's doorjamb,
it was in mine.

768
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,561
<i>8328...</i>

769
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,963
Bartlesville Avenue.

770
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,529
That's not a nice neighborhood.

771
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,484
Okay. Still, we have to go.

772
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,364
But not tonight, obviously.

773
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,885
Wait, what?
Why not tonight?

774
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,690
<i>Because you're
a rational human being.</i>

775
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,524
<i>And because
you weigh 130 pounds</i>

776
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,125
<i>and don't wanna die.</i>

777
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,441
You can't go
to a strange building

778
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,363
in the Detroit-iest part
of Orlando...

779
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,646
in the middle of the night.

780
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,240
All right, fine.
We'll go tomorrow morning?

781
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,329
But we have school tomorrow.

782
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,451
Not if we don't show up.

783
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,929
Angela's gonna kill me.
No, she won't kill you.

784
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,001
Every day
I walk her to calculus.

785
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,127
She'll survive.

786
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,204
What about Lacey?

787
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,925
What if she's looking for me?

788
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,570
Has Lacey ever been
looking for you?

789
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,767
We might miss
something important.

790
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,887
You're missing gym class.

791
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,206
Guys, seriously,
if you don't wanna go...

792
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,090
It's not that. It's just,

793
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,480
I've never missed school before.

794
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,921
Neither have I.

795
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,451
Yeah, and it feels
kind of wrong.

796
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,920
I give you that. It does feel
kind of wrong. But it also...

797
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,086
...feels kind of right.

798
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,366
Am I right?

799
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,124
Using that voice
doesn't change anything.

800
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,566
Aw, but doesn't it?

801
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,641
It changes a little.

802
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,210
I think it changes
something a little bit.

803
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,645
Doesn't change it a little bit?

804
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,763
We got no time to waste!

805
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,527
Yeah, see?
We gotta go right now!

806
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,008
Let's go find Margo!

807
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,445
Start the car, let's go.

808
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,524
Was that Italian?

809
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,480
- A full right?
- Yeah.

810
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,641
You're terrible at directions.

811
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,086
Whatever. This is it.

812
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,725
This is it?

813
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,128
Why would she come here?

814
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,690
It's locked.

815
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,326
Now what?

816
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,126
Get a rock?

817
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,161
Margo?

818
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,000
Anyone?

819
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,286
Guys?

820
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,810
I think the last time
I was this scared,

821
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,370
I had to sleep
with the light on.

822
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,806
Last time I was this scared,

823
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,803
I had to sleep
with a stuffed animal.

824
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,123
Last time I was this scared,

825
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,725
I had to sleep
in my mom's bed.

826
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,800
Q, if I were you,
I would get that scared

827
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,729
every single night.

828
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,485
So, we're in
a souvenir store?

829
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,486
No Margo.

830
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,681
For some reason,
she wanted you to come here.

831
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,204
This stuff is old.

832
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,440
Guys?

833
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,530
Did you find something?

834
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,241
Paper towns.

835
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,045
Bro, can we go?

836
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,690
What if it's Margo?

837
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,966
What if it's literally
anything else?

838
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,441
Goodbye.

839
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,683
In a thousand pages,

840
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,000
they talk about
whale anatomy...

841
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,362
and in the last 50 pages
the dude kills the whale.

842
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,524
So, it's not about
a dude killing a whale.

843
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,684
Maybe it's about a guy
who actually believes...

844
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,161
that if he chases this whale
down and kills this whale...

845
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,971
it's gonna give his life
some meaning. That's Ahab.

846
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,724
It's a common
misconception that...

847
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,161
...a lot of people...

848
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,961
Don't forget, final papers
are due next week.

849
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,804
Also, pick up
your pop quizzes

850
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,530
from yesterday
on your way out.

851
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,411
You're not gonna be too happy.

852
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,121
No circling
two answers next time.

853
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,169
Like I'm just gonna
let you get the one

854
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,083
that you didn't mean.

855
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,321
Not cool.

856
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,326
There was a quiz yesterday?

857
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,881
Pop quiz. You missed it.

858
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,691
Is there any way that I can
get a makeup test?

859
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,764
It's one quiz, Quentin. Relax.
You can still be a doctor.

860
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,041
All right, get out.

861
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,121
Yes.

862
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,247
Okay.

863
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,320
Hey.

864
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,361
Oh, hey.

865
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,766
Anything?

866
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,282
Did she ever say
anything to you about

867
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,362
an abandoned building
on the west side?

868
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,885
Like, an old souvenir shop?

869
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,042
No. You think
she'd be there?

870
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,205
I don't know,
but I think she was once

871
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,441
and it's connected somehow.

872
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,722
See you tonight?
Oh. I don't know. Probably.

873
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,807
Let me know
if you need a ride.

874
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,881
Okay.

875
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,723
Party at Jase's.

876
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,808
I thought you weren't
talking to Jase.

877
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,325
I'm not.

878
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,721
But you can still
go to a party at his house?

879
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,484
Everyone's going.

880
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,040
Not everyone.

881
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,844
<i>We should totally go!</i>

882
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,402
Wait, what?
Jase Worthington's house?
Yes!

883
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,084
Are you crazy?
It's just a party.

884
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,520
We've never been
to one of those.

885
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,642
We've been to plenty of parties.
No.

886
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,404
If there's a tuba there,
it's not a party.

887
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,567
All right.
I don't believe this, Radar.

888
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,641
What about Angela?

889
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,489
Angela is a mature,
intelligent,

890
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,891
understanding woman...

891
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,769
who never has to know
about this.

892
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,922
I don't wanna go to a party
at Jase Worthington's house.

893
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,040
You guys can go.

894
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,684
Q, are you seriously
gonna spend

895
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,569
the rest of high school pining
for a girl that ran away?

896
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,800
I'm not pining for her, okay?
I'm trying to find her.

897
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,325
Stop being an asshole.

898
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,445
I'm not being an asshole.

899
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,249
I'm trying to be
a regular kid for a change.

900
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,609
Have fun.
What?

901
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,250
Hello, Quentin.

902
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,049
Margo, where have you been?

903
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,365
Everywhere.

904
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,170
Nowhere.

905
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,011
You have to get lost
before you find yourself.

906
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,120
People were worried about you.

907
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,287
No, they weren't.

908
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,566
I was.

909
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,882
You're sweet, Quentin.

910
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,964
You've always been sweet.

911
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,641
I'm glad you're back, Margo.

912
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,884
But I'm not.

913
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,563
Are you gonna answer that?

914
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,245
- Hello?
<i>- Q?</i>

915
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,643
<i>Q, yes! Yes!</i>

916
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,844
Quentin Jacobsen is inside
of my phone, everybody!

917
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,081
Ben, give me the phone.

918
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,321
Stop it!

919
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,687
<i>- Stop. Go lie down.
- Stop it! Gonna go party.</i>

920
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,761
Go, sit down.

921
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,171
Hey, how soon
can you get here?

922
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,607
<i>It's chaos. We need you.
Ben needs you.</i>

923
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,162
No. I told you I'm not going
to Worthington's.

924
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,367
Plus, Ben's, like...

925
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,681
Ben's a dick.

926
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,001
You know what your
problem is, Quentin?

927
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,009
You keep expecting people
to not be themselves.

928
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,969
You are not Ben.
Ben is not you.

929
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,401
We're all different people.
That's why we're best friends.

930
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,527
<i>All right?</i>

931
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,682
<i>Get in your van
and get over here.</i>

932
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,806
<i>Besides, Margo's been in this
house a million times.</i>

933
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,684
<i>You might even find something.</i>

934
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,688
I think we might
be here for a while.

935
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,404
I'm gonna be back.

936
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,440
You're so much
better than her.

937
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,528
- Yeah, Jase?
- Yeah.

938
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,760
Becca.

939
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,286
Who's there?
Whoa!

940
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,800
Hi. Lacey.

941
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,082
What the hell
are you doing in here?

942
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,083
I'm just peeing.

943
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,767
Well, stop.

944
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,047
I can't just stop like that.
Okay, fine.

945
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,725
Finish and then get out.

946
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,081
Okay.

947
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,370
Sorry about that.

948
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,641
You okay, Lacey?

949
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,762
I've been better.

950
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,609
You wanna get
in the tub with me?

951
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,000
Not like that.

952
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,004
Not like that!

953
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,480
Um...

954
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,090
Yeah, sure.

955
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,445
Look at me.

956
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,681
Huh?

957
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,690
What's the first word
that pops into your head?

958
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,091
I don't know. I can't...

959
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,287
Come on.

960
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,161
Beautiful.

961
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,522
See, no. No.

962
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,011
Okay.

963
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,681
What?

964
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,365
That's the problem.

965
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,684
No one ever looks at me
and thinks that I'm smart...

966
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,280
or clever...

967
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,204
or interesting, you know?

968
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,206
I have a brain.
I'm going to Dartmouth.

969
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,285
So, uh...

970
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,203
Is that what you're
upset about?

971
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,681
Becca and I got in a fight.

972
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,811
She called me a bitch
and a whore.

973
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,043
And then she stood
on a couch

974
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,724
and shushed the entire party

975
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,644
and told them
I have chlamydia.

976
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,802
Oh, man.
Yeah. Which, I don't.

977
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,565
Yeah.
Anymore.

978
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,961
But, I'm not a slut.

979
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,889
I don't think you're a slut.

980
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,485
Thanks.

981
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,211
Don't even...
Becca's just jealous.

982
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,561
Why would Becca be jealous?

983
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,485
She's dating Jase.
She's gonna be prom queen.

984
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,722
She's basically the new Margo.

985
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,244
No one will ever be
the new Margo.

986
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,206
You're right.

987
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,761
No one could ever be
the new Margo.

988
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,925
Really?

989
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,010
I hate that guy.
Me, too.

990
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,924
He's the worst.
The worst.

991
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,609
Here, let me help you up.

992
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,241
Thanks.

993
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,446
Hey, if anyone gives you
any trouble...

994
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,047
Thanks.

995
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,202
I can't fight, but...
Thank you.

996
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,602
Hey. I'm gonna
catch up with you.

997
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,285
Okay.
Okay.

998
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,841
<i>Valar morghulis!</i>

999
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,365
Dude,
put your shirt on. Get down.

1000
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,445
<i>Valar morghulis!</i>
How much did he drink?

1001
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,643
I think it's stuck to my hand.

1002
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,651
Hey, Ben?

1003
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,847
Yes, Quentin, approach.

1004
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,201
I pronounce thee a knight

1005
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,770
of the Hefeweizen
Order, all right?

1006
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,169
Thanks, Ben.
Hey, we gotta go.

1007
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,320
No, I wanna party.

1008
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,560
I think I know where Margo is.

1009
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,647
Wait, for real?
Yeah.

1010
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,841
Lacey!

1011
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,366
Lacey!

1012
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,883
I have to tell you
something, okay?

1013
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,560
It's not the beer talking,
okay? It's the me talking.

1014
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,722
I just needed beer...

1015
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,451
to get the words
from my brain to my mouth.

1016
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,281
I wanted to say this
for a really long time.

1017
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,045
Ben! Hey!

1018
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,884
Ben? You all right?

1019
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,400
Let's get out of here.

1020
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,404
I feel so much better.

1021
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,481
Let's go, buddy.

1022
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,483
- God save the Queen!
- Stop.

1023
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,846
Radar, I love you.

1024
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,405
Don't kiss me.

1025
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,324
Where are we going?
You'll see.

1026
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,481
I love you.

1027
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,244
It's not that shady-ass
shopping center, is it?

1028
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,321
What?

1029
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,401
Q!

1030
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,730
Oh, God.

1031
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,006
Isn't this far enough?

1032
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,764
No. Come on, guys.

1033
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,921
Let's sing a song.

1034
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,081
What?

1035
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,083
You don't get as scared
if you sing.

1036
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,049
Okay. What should we sing?

1037
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,531
I don't know, anything.

1038
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,003
Maybe just sing the first song
that pops into your head.

1039
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,927
<i>I wanna be the very best</i>

1040
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,090
<i>Like no one ever was</i>

1041
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,969
<i>To catch them
is my real test</i>

1042
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,361
<i>To train them
is my cause</i>

1043
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,045
That's the first song
that popped in your head?

1044
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,201
It's working.

1045
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:45,526
<i>I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide</i>

1046
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,531
<i>Each Pokémon to understand</i>

1047
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,961
<i>The power that's inside</i>

1048
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,966
<i>Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em
It's you and me</i>

1049
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,600
<i>I know it's my destiny
Pokémon!</i>

1050
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,402
<i>Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend</i>

1051
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,281
<i>Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em
A heart so true</i>

1052
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,602
<i>Your courage
will pull us through</i>

1053
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,331
<i>You teach me
and I'll teach you</i>

1054
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,723
<i>Pokémon!
Gotta catch 'em all</i>

1055
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,841
<i>Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all</i>

1056
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,325
<i>Gotta catch 'em all</i>

1057
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,841
Hey!

1058
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,242
Oh...
Jesus Christ.

1059
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,321
Lacey?

1060
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,084
You scared
the shit out of us.

1061
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,960
What are you guys
doing here?

1062
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,081
What are you doing here?

1063
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,843
I followed you.

1064
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,128
I don't know.
I thought maybe you found her.

1065
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,085
No, she's not here...

1066
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,969
but I think I know
where she might be.

1067
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,764
Guys, come on. This way.

1068
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,602
I wasn't scared before,
back there.

1069
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,884
Okay.

1070
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,045
Just love me some Pikachu.

1071
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,322
I'm more of a Charizard girl.

1072
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,041
What is it?

1073
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,207
Margo hung something here...

1074
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,330
and I think it was a map.

1075
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,241
Okay.

1076
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,089
This is Margo's map.

1077
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,608
And this is where
she used to hang it.

1078
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,444
So where is she now?

1079
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,360
Let's see.

1080
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,931
She is...

1081
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,964
somewhere...

1082
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,884
in upstate New York.

1083
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,646
Can you be any less specific?

1084
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,804
This... general area.

1085
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,371
Is there a town?

1086
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,800
Let me see.

1087
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,483
Yeah, there's...

1088
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,325
There's nothing there, bro.

1089
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,970
There has to be
something there.

1090
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,769
Roscoe, Rockland, Beaverkill,
Agloe, Chatham, Wallaceberg.

1091
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,446
These are all the towns
in that general vicinity.

1092
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,126
Are any of them paper towns?

1093
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,401
What's a paper town?

1094
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,481
It's a fake city
that map makers

1095
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,600
would put on their maps...

1096
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,405
so if they get copied
illegally, they'd know...

1097
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,561
...that they're being copied.
Whoa.

1098
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,687
What?

1099
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,410
Agloe, New York.

1100
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,244
"Agloe, New York,
population zero...

1101
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,006
"is one of the most famous
paper towns in America."

1102
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,167
Look at this.

1103
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,606
"The present day population

1104
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,523
"of Agloe, New York, is 1."

1105
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,845
She's in Agloe.

1106
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,161
What?

1107
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,606
Agloe.

1108
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,841
Q, you gotta go.

1109
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,441
What?

1110
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,206
That's where Margo is.
You need to go right now.

1111
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,691
Were you listening, Ben?

1112
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,649
It's New York.
I can't go to New York.

1113
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,440
Why? You have a car.
What is stopping you?

1114
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,891
Like, 1,200 miles.

1115
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,690
Well, there you go.

1116
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,486
That's 1,200 miles between you
and your love of your life.

1117
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,369
Because you love her, right?

1118
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,565
Yeah, I do.

1119
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,210
There you go.
Your true love waits.

1120
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,281
You're right.

1121
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,686
I'm gonna do it.

1122
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,842
Do it!
Wait, I wanna go.

1123
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,001
Wait, what?

1124
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,051
She's my best friend.
I'm going with you.

1125
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,841
Okay.

1126
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,405
If she's going...

1127
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,085
I'm definitely going.

1128
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,208
Okay, yeah. All right.

1129
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,006
Radar?

1130
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,527
I don't know, guys.

1131
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,681
Come on, buddy!

1132
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,211
If we're all going,
let's just make this a trip.

1133
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,486
What about your parents?
What about school?

1134
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,085
Parents, bro.
What about prom?

1135
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,321
Who cares about prom?

1136
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,527
We're not missing prom!

1137
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,845
Okay, fine,
we'll get back by prom.

1138
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,605
You're really doing this?

1139
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,841
And we're doing it now.

1140
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,764
Doing it right this damn second!

1141
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,684
We got no time
to waste, Radar.

1142
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,607
Okay.

1143
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,091
- Yes!
- Yay, Let's go!

1144
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,600
We gotta make a stop, first.

1145
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,611
You know how I told you
I was staying in

1146
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,047
to watch the <i>Cosmos</i> marathon?

1147
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,441
I lied. I was at a party.

1148
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,443
Not only that...

1149
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,284
but I drank a beer.

1150
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,966
I didn't drink it,
but I held it.

1151
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,121
Girls were talking to me.

1152
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,964
And now the guys and I...

1153
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,487
Correction. The guys and I
and Lacey Pemberton...

1154
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,285
we're driving to New York.

1155
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,046
Wait, you're what?

1156
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,771
It's a really long story.

1157
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,641
Are you breaking up with me?

1158
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,960
Am I...? What?

1159
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,089
No, no, no.

1160
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,806
I wanted to be
honest with you

1161
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,962
and I don't want you
to be mad at me.

1162
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,161
Marcus,

1163
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,170
why do I get
the feeling that

1164
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,770
you're afraid of me?

1165
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,281
I'm not.

1166
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,727
That is... That's... What?

1167
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,763
You pretended to like
that Ed Sheeran song

1168
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,086
when I know you didn't.

1169
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,651
It was mixed well.

1170
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,491
You've never once invited me
to hang out with your friends.

1171
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,364
That's more about
them than you.

1172
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,285
You've never even had me
over to your house.

1173
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,484
Uh...
Why is that?

1174
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,241
Hmm?

1175
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,563
It's a story
for another time.

1176
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,685
I promise, Angela,
one day I will answer that,

1177
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,205
but not today.

1178
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,806
I'm not afraid of you.

1179
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,842
I'm afraid of losing you.

1180
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,441
Aw.

1181
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,610
Marcus.

1182
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,411
Angela's gonna come with us.

1183
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,486
- Okay.
- Hey!

1184
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,165
Hi.
Hello.

1185
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,360
Don't say anything stupid.

1186
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,760
When would we ever?

1187
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,482
This is definitely
the craziest thing

1188
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,647
I will ever do in my life.

1189
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,404
Not if I can help it.

1190
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,246
<i>Embedded in a magazine</i>

1191
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,961
<i>Embedded in a drama queen</i>

1192
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,610
According to my calculations,

1193
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,251
our average cruising speed
should be 72.

1194
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,050
You're going 64.

1195
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,201
I don't
wanna get pulled over.

1196
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,486
We're not gonna make it.
We're gonna make it.

1197
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,721
We have plenty of time.
We're gonna make it.

1198
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,205
Excuse me,
I hope you don't think that

1199
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,851
we're gonna be back
with 20 minutes to spare.

1200
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,960
I have a hair appointment.

1201
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,525
Angela has to get
her nails done.

1202
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,800
Do you know how long it takes
to put on a prom dress?

1203
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,364
The answer is all day.

1204
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,925
Plus, my parents
wanna take pictures.

1205
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,081
We have a limo coming.

1206
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,924
We have to be back
with 12 hours to spare

1207
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,001
or prom is ruined.

1208
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,205
Prom is very important.

1209
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,571
Thank you.

1210
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,406
I have to pee.

1211
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,721
- Ben.
- Lacey!

1212
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,089
Oh, shit!
I really have to pee.

1213
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,247
Pull over.

1214
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,324
No, we can only
stop four times...

1215
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,084
if we're gonna get there,
find Margo,

1216
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,764
and be back
in time for prom.

1217
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:53,967
How long have we been driving?

1218
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,167
35 minutes.

1219
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,562
I'll hold it. Yep.
I'm gonna hold it.

1220
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,131
- Good.
- I'll hold it. Yep.

1221
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,769
Nope, we gotta stop.
No, we're not stopping.

1222
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,171
Bro! You don't...

1223
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,287
Just think about
something else.

1224
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,691
Yeah.
Like what?

1225
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,569
Like rainstorms.
Or waterfalls.

1226
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,642
An exploding bladder.

1227
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,848
That is not helping, Radar.
Not helping.

1228
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,170
70% of my body is urine.

1229
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,765
I'm going as fast as I can.

1230
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,841
Not exactly true.

1231
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,921
I'm going
as fast as I'm willing.

1232
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,445
Oh, my God,
I think I'm gonna cry.

1233
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,806
I'm gonna cry pee.

1234
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,961
Oh, my God.

1235
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,810
No.
Here, pee in this.

1236
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,489
No, do not get
pee in my car.

1237
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,641
- No, Ben...
- Gross.

1238
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,371
Hey! Do you want me to die?

1239
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,329
Do you want me to die?

1240
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,448
Why?
Why are you doing this?

1241
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,761
It's so gross.

1242
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,405
Radar, it's so good.

1243
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,289
Don't say my name.

1244
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,442
Radar, it feels so good.

1245
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,250
Oh, my God.

1246
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,681
Uh...

1247
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,761
I'm gonna need another can.

1248
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,921
- No!
- Grab it!

1249
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,371
Guys, another can...
Take it!

1250
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,284
I'm switching,
I'm switching.

1251
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,481
Careful!

1252
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,805
So gross!

1253
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,406
It's nasty.

1254
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,321
Yes!

1255
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,646
What's happening back there?

1256
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,884
I'm Ben Starling.
Oh, my God.

1257
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,127
JPHS marching band.

1258
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,281
Oh, my God.

1259
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,646
Keg stand record holder.

1260
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,643
And now, I am
pee-in-the-car champion!

1261
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,721
Ben.

1262
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,320
I'm the greatest!
I shook up the world!

1263
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,361
No!

1264
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,009
Perhaps we should make
one of those stops now.

1265
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,648
All right. This is how
this is gonna work.

1266
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,801
<i>If we're gonna
keep on schedule,</i>

1267
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,245
<i>we have six minutes.</i>

1268
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,408
<i>I'm the gas man.
I start the fill-up...</i>

1269
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,961
<i>you guys run inside
while the pump is pumping.</i>

1270
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,361
<i>I take the credit card</i>

1271
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,441
<i>to the guy behind the counter...</i>

1272
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,005
<i>and hold our spot in line.</i>

1273
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,081
<i>I pee.</i>

1274
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,441
Jesus, dude.
What? I had a lot to drink.

1275
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,125
<i>I've got liquids.</i>

1276
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,801
<i>Q?</i>

1277
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,570
<i>Tortilla chips,
beef jerky, pretzels,</i>

1278
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,290
<i>peanuts, Milk Duds,
Twizzlers. Got it.</i>

1279
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,721
<i>And definitely,
definitely</i>

1280
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,926
<i>get cleaning supplies.</i>

1281
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,411
<i>It reeks in here.</i>

1282
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,481
Whoo!

1283
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,609
You like dragons?

1284
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,931
No.

1285
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,241
One minute!

1286
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,441
<i>Someone better get me a shirt.</i>

1287
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,567
<i>Me, too.</i>

1288
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,440
<i>As soon as the tank is full,
I'm honking the horn...</i>

1289
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,640
<i>and all of you guys have
10 seconds to hop back in...</i>

1290
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,846
<i>or I'm leaving your asses.</i>

1291
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,161
Except you, baby.

1292
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,281
Aw.

1293
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,649
You guys need a bag?

1294
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,051
Uh...

1295
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,086
No, thank you.

1296
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,006
Go, go, go!

1297
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,601
Six minutes flat!

1298
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,921
Get in, get in, get in!

1299
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,250
Yeah. Nice.

1300
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,884
I'm gonna need one of those.

1301
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,961
Thank you.

1302
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,201
Really?

1303
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,168
Dude, I just grabbed them
out of a bin. I'm so sorry.

1304
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,560
I'm so sorry.

1305
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,801
You kidding me?

1306
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,729
Last time you're going
shopping for me, Q.

1307
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,410
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1308
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,922
Yeah,
it's better that way.

1309
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,521
<i>Coming to your house</i>

1310
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,402
<i>Knocking at your door</i>

1311
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:44,206
<i>You mind a sip of wine?</i>

1312
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:48,046
<i>You cool me, cool me down</i>

1313
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,726
<i>Do you know me
you know me, you know me</i>

1314
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,849
<i>Do you know me now?</i>

1315
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,402
<i>Oh</i>

1316
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:01,166
<i>The kid you used to be</i>

1317
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:04,369
<i>Well, I know that
you're still there</i>

1318
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,124
<i>I hope you had
a great summer</i>

1319
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,362
Mom, I'm sorry.
It was super last-minute.

1320
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,401
We're not going
to New York City.

1321
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,527
We're going to New York State.

1322
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,170
It's way safer.

1323
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,891
Just two days. I love you,
Mom. Thank you. Bye.

1324
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,925
<i>I hope you
had a great summer</i>

1325
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,447
<i>A great summer away</i>

1326
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,445
<i>I hope you
had a great summer</i>

1327
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,569
<i>A great summer away</i>

1328
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,802
I still can't believe
she hasn't called.

1329
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,560
They probably don't
have phones in Agloe.

1330
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,090
She has a cell.

1331
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,527
How do we know that she's
even still in Agloe?

1332
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,920
I just do.

1333
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,642
I bet she's in the middle
of the Atlantic somewhere.

1334
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,290
On some billionaire's yacht.

1335
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,885
Maybe she's been
back in Orlando

1336
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,086
watching us look for her.

1337
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,242
Nope. She's in Agloe.
I promise.

1338
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,404
I admire your faith.
It's very romantic.

1339
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,449
Thank you. I'm on a mission.

1340
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,926
I'm Captain Ahab.

1341
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,326
You do realize Captain Ahab's
not the hero of that story?

1342
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,441
Only because he didn't succeed.

1343
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,567
I don't think that...

1344
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,641
Q! Hey!

1345
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,290
Is everyone all right?

1346
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,531
I'm okay. Are you okay?

1347
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,682
Oh, my God.
You guys okay?

1348
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,405
Hey, Ben, you okay?

1349
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,561
Hey.

1350
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,401
Hey.

1351
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,521
Your face is bleeding.

1352
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,006
What?

1353
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,121
Ooh.
It's not that bad,

1354
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,361
It's just...

1355
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,761
Thanks.

1356
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,326
Thank you. Okay, bye.

1357
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,687
All right. It's gonna be
a couple of hours.

1358
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,161
All right.
It looks good, considering.

1359
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,651
Considering we didn't die.

1360
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,404
Yeah.
Yeah.

1361
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,687
What happened?

1362
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,129
There was a cow
in the middle of the highway.

1363
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,770
Cow? It was a land whale.

1364
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,241
And Ben, at the last second,
grabbed the steering wheel...

1365
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,323
spun us to safety,
saves our lives.

1366
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,845
You were a vehicular ballerina.

1367
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,160
I didn't know
what I was doing.

1368
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,243
It was the best damn
passenger seat driving

1369
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,529
I've ever seen in my entire life.
Thank you.

1370
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,282
Yeah, it's what
I'm here for, so...

1371
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,845
All right,
now what do we do?

1372
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,367
We wait.

1373
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,761
I think we could probably
all use some rest.

1374
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,001
Seriously.

1375
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,729
How we doing on time?

1376
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,642
I'll miss my hair appointment...

1377
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,165
but a few hours
won't hurt us.

1378
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,840
Guys,
before this week...

1379
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,211
I think the craziest thing
that we did

1380
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,089
was sneak into <i>Snow Dogs</i>
without paying.

1381
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,480
<i>Snow Dogs.</i>

1382
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,011
I love that movie.

1383
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,811
Remember the time that we
stole your dad's cigars...

1384
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,847
then we all smoked them
behind the house?

1385
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,440
You couldn't stop coughing.
Yeah. It was gross!

1386
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,971
That was disgusting.

1387
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,122
I don't think you're supposed to inhale it.
Good times.

1388
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,281
Remember that time
when we were all

1389
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,447
definitely gonna die
but then Ben

1390
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,841
grabbed the steering wheel
and we didn't die?

1391
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,445
Pretty awesome.

1392
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,602
Thank you. Thank you.

1393
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,200
Yeah, I can't believe
it's almost over.

1394
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,520
The road trip?

1395
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,761
High school.

1396
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,685
We hate high school.

1397
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,444
He's right, though.

1398
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,725
I've been thinking
about it a lot lately.

1399
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,484
The lastness of it all.

1400
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,927
The last time we'll ever
be together in the band room.

1401
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,605
Last time we'll
ever eat pizza

1402
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,921
and nasty tater tots
in the cafeteria.

1403
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,082
Last homeroom,
last science lab.

1404
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,651
These are all terrible,
terrible things.

1405
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,609
That we're never gonna
get to do again.

1406
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,489
And, like, this stuff.

1407
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,561
Hmm?

1408
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,564
Well, I'm going to UCF.

1409
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,165
You're going
to North Carolina,

1410
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,765
you're going to Boston.

1411
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,560
We've known each other
since we were fetuses.

1412
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,969
And it's not gonna
be like that anymore.

1413
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,723
And that's gonna suck for me.

1414
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,125
Me, too.

1415
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,602
Stop. You guys
are bumming me out.

1416
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,168
We can't sleep.

1417
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,481
You wanna take a walk?

1418
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,766
Sure.

1419
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,170
- Hey.
- Hey.

1420
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,731
You cold?

1421
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,881
Yeah.

1422
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,561
Actually...

1423
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,449
I'm feeling like
I'm gonna probably

1424
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,567
get some sleep, too.

1425
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,641
Yeah.

1426
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,771
All right, see you.

1427
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,126
Bye.

1428
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,402
What was it you
wanted to tell me...

1429
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,770
back at Jase's house,
before you puked yourself?

1430
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,960
Nah.

1431
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,287
It was something stupid, probably.

1432
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,445
I don't know.
I didn't really know you then.

1433
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,921
You're not kind of
what I had thought.

1434
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,321
What'd you think?

1435
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,687
You know...

1436
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:15,887
What?

1437
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,764
That you were hot...

1438
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,685
and your face...

1439
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,121
and torso.

1440
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,765
I'm sorry.

1441
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,049
Listen, you are all those
things, obviously.

1442
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,480
But, um...

1443
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,403
You're also pretty cool.

1444
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,200
Drive all this way
for your friend,

1445
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,571
I don't know.

1446
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,647
If you ask me,
someone like Margo

1447
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,728
doesn't really deserve you.

1448
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,406
You know?

1449
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,481
Would you wanna
go to prom with me?

1450
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,401
Yes.

1451
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,727
Okay.

1452
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:10,927
Yes.

1453
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,241
Okay.

1454
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,287
Yes.

1455
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,649
Wait, say that again?

1456
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,245
You're really gonna
make me say it again?

1457
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,289
Black Santas?

1458
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,727
I know. I know.

1459
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,967
I know it sounds weird.

1460
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,361
It's actually 20 times
weirder in person.

1461
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,561
No, I think
it's progressive.

1462
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,966
No, you don't!

1463
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,090
I do! Santa is a construct.

1464
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,241
It doesn't make sense

1465
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,209
that he's always
an old white guy.

1466
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,761
I think that it's cool
that your parents are willing

1467
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,604
to embrace the complexity
of that idea.

1468
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,410
Yeah, I think about that
every morning...

1469
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,600
when I eat my Lucky Charms

1470
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,768
with a little black Santa spoon.

1471
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,363
<i>You don't have to speak</i>

1472
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,525
<i>Just keep me company</i>

1473
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:31,290
<i>Be mine</i>

1474
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:38,242
<i>Be mine</i>

1475
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,642
<i>Be mine</i>

1476
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,481
Cool. Thank you.

1477
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,846
So long.

1478
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,806
Hey.

1479
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,285
What's that look on your face?

1480
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,289
What? What look?

1481
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,211
You look like...
You're acting very strange.

1482
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,686
You are.

1483
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,524
You got a weird little
grin on your face.

1484
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,727
What is that about?

1485
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,847
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1486
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,570
Scoot! Scoot.

1487
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,210
Ben, did you notice
something about him?

1488
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,486
He looks kinda strange, like he's...

1489
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,648
You're grinning or something.
What happened?

1490
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,761
I have news.

1491
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,681
What?

1492
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,044
I'm going to prom
with Lacey Pemberton.

1493
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,725
Holy shit! Really?
Yeah.

1494
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,967
Congratulations, man.
I know, dude.

1495
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,451
Bloody Ben and Lacey Pemberton.

1496
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,011
Angela and I had sex.

1497
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,161
Dude!

1498
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,481
What?
What?

1499
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,966
You just had sex with Angela?

1500
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,041
Bro, are you serious?

1501
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,360
Yeah. Don't tell her
I told you.

1502
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,089
What are you guys
talking about?

1503
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,081
Books.

1504
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,445
Books?
Books?

1505
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,444
I told them.

1506
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,927
Bro.

1507
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,122
I thought you could
make it to Scranton.

1508
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,810
I really did.

1509
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,961
Shotgun!
Move!

1510
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,571
All right, Radar, big man,
what's the ETA?

1511
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,080
If we continue
at yesterday's pace,

1512
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,167
we should be there
in four hours.

1513
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,241
All right.

1514
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,527
Dude, awesome. That leaves
an hour to find Margo...

1515
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,250
tell her you love her.

1516
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,607
Back in time
for an amazing prom.

1517
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,361
Agloe, here we come.

1518
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,928
Hey! Check it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

1519
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,564
This is insane.

1520
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,651
<i>On a drive
I'm taking backroads</i>

1521
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,770
<i>High against where
the rivers are flowing</i>

1522
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,767
<i>I didn't think
that our love had grown</i>

1523
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,889
<i>Cross the bridge</i>

1524
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:00,124
<i>To redefine your pain</i>

1525
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,884
<i>Wide awake</i>

1526
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,568
<i>I rearrange the way
I listen in the dark</i>

1527
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:11,931
<i>Dreaming of
starting up again</i>

1528
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,442
According to Omnictionary,

1529
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,931
this should be it.

1530
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,840
Margo?

1531
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,646
No?

1532
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,290
Let's look around.

1533
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,961
Okay.

1534
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,321
Yeah, all right.

1535
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,323
How are we doing on time?

1536
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,081
If we wanna make it back for prom,
we should probably...

1537
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,406
go.

1538
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,482
She'll be here. I know it.

1539
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,051
Q...
She'll be here. I know it.

1540
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,850
I know it.

1541
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,170
It's time to go, Q.

1542
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,001
He's right.

1543
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,003
Guys, we can't give up yet.
It's Margo.

1544
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,240
She's probably sitting,
watching right now, laughing.

1545
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,327
This is our final test.

1546
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,760
You promised
we'd be back for prom.

1547
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,450
Not that again. Seriously?

1548
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,601
I don't wanna
miss prom, either.

1549
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:12,806
Five seconds ago,
you couldn't get a date

1550
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,166
to prom if your life
depended on it.

1551
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,401
And now, suddenly,
it's the end of the world

1552
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,245
if you're not there. Just because
you don't give a shit about prom...

1553
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,163
it doesn't mean
that nobody else does.

1554
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,322
Prom is more important
than your best friend?

1555
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,646
That's what you're saying?

1556
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,286
No. That's not
what I'm saying.

1557
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,046
Why did you even come
if you're not gonna see this through?

1558
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,406
Because I thought
it would be fun...

1559
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,130
because I wanted to spend
time with my two best friends...

1560
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,247
Before we leave
for college and

1561
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,321
probably never see
each other again.

1562
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,680
Yeah, wasn't this
fun for you?

1563
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,440
Not if I don't find Margo.
Don't you get it?

1564
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,291
If I don't find Margo, it's not fun.
It's all for nothing.

1565
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,170
Wow, okay.

1566
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,521
What about you, Lacey?
Don't you wanna find her?

1567
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,806
I thought I did...

1568
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,408
but you know what, Quentin?

1569
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,484
I came all this way because
I was worried about her.

1570
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,290
Do you think she'd do
the same for me?

1571
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,448
Would she do it for you?

1572
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,165
Come on.

1573
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,885
I'm gonna stay.

1574
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,480
I'm gonna find a bus
back to Orlando.

1575
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,681
Have a great prom,
everybody.

1576
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,330
- Q.
- No.

1577
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,009
Go. Go.

1578
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,885
Are you serious?

1579
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,126
Q, let's go.

1580
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,970
I'm not going! Okay?
I'm not going!

1581
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,122
All right, great.
Good luck!

1582
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,048
<i>I'm trying to get home
to Orlando.</i>

1583
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,970
Here you go.
Okay.

1584
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:02,880
Margo?

1585
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,370
Quentin.

1586
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,726
Hi!

1587
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,881
I knew I'd find you.
I knew it.

1588
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,962
I can't believe you're here.

1589
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,646
How are you?

1590
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,364
Wait, what? What do you mean
you can't believe I'm here?

1591
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,729
I'm just a little surprised.

1592
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,245
Wait, what are you
surprised about?

1593
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,810
I followed the clues...

1594
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,450
I found that note
that you left in my door...

1595
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,007
and then I saw the "You will
go to the paper towns..."

1596
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,491
I read the whole Walt Whitman...

1597
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,766
and, you know...

1598
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,121
You left those clues
for me, right?

1599
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,409
Yeah, I always
leave clues...

1600
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,607
Yeah.

1601
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,127
...so you'd know I was fine.
That I was okay.

1602
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,684
I didn't think you would
come all this way.

1603
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,002
Wait, what did you think?

1604
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,051
Quentin,
what are you doing here?

1605
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,282
I'm in love with you.

1606
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,407
You're in love with me.

1607
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,925
Yes.

1608
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,730
Quentin...

1609
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,481
come on.

1610
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,722
I've loved you
since we were kids.

1611
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,926
And I've never stopped
loving you every single day since.

1612
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,202
You're not in love with me.

1613
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,964
Don't say that.

1614
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,804
You don't even know me.

1615
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,440
Yeah, I do.
Don't say that I don't...

1616
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,767
I don't even know me.

1617
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,208
Q, I have no idea who I am.

1618
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:05,011
Why do you think I'm here?

1619
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,801
I...

1620
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,921
I thought...

1621
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,371
Why are you here?

1622
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,568
Can I buy you a drink?

1623
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:33,041
Thank you.

1624
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,286
I'd been planning to leave
for a while, actually.

1625
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,690
I would graduate,
do the whole cap and gown thing...

1626
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,884
and then, the next morning...
Poof

1627
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,521
Into thin air.

1628
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:48,088
And then I found out about
the whole Jase thing, and that was it.

1629
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,967
I couldn't take another
second of that place.

1630
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,285
It was really that bad?

1631
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,606
You know what it's like.

1632
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:55,841
Yeah, but...

1633
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,765
I don't know.
You had everything.

1634
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,330
You were Margo Roth Spiegelman.

1635
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,369
That's it.
That's the problem, Q.

1636
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,602
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1637
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,047
People have always
looked at me

1638
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,447
and seen
what they wanted to see.

1639
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:11,521
And yes, I know...

1640
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:14,126
I cultivated it a little.

1641
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,806
"The myth of Margo Roth Spiegelman."

1642
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,526
But it's just a fantasy.

1643
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:22,920
And there we were...

1644
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,724
at the top
of the SunTrust building,

1645
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,121
looking down on the city.

1646
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,687
And all I could think about...

1647
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:34,361
was how I felt just as paper
as everything else.

1648
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:38,961
Hmm.

1649
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,609
So then you came here?

1650
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:46,130
A paper town
for a paper girl.

1651
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,809
Not a lot to do,
but it's a great place

1652
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,405
to read and think.

1653
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,720
Can I ask you something?

1654
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,120
Of course.

1655
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,566
Where do I fit in
to all this?

1656
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,084
You were
my first partner in crime.

1657
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,288
I wanted you to be my last.

1658
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,244
<i>And you surprised me that night.</i>

1659
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,410
<i>You really did.</i>

1660
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,924
<i>You're a way better ninja
than I expected.</i>

1661
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,651
You know, Q,
I'm really sorry.

1662
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,211
For what?

1663
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,001
For all of it.

1664
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,764
The clues.

1665
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:35,207
Not being a better friend.

1666
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,402
Ruining your last few weeks
of high school.

1667
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,211
You didn't.

1668
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:47,921
What?

1669
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,890
You didn't ruin my last
few weeks of high school.

1670
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,451
In fact...

1671
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,565
I think they were
the best weeks of my life.

1672
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,928
First party.

1673
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,050
First road trip.

1674
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,007
My first time cutting class.

1675
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,125
Everybody else is doing
things for the last time...

1676
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,161
but I was doing them
for the first. So...

1677
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,450
don't apologize.

1678
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,246
Because...

1679
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,247
None of that would have
happened without you.

1680
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,761
Are you sure you don't
want to come back?

1681
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:48,604
College, job, husband.

1682
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:51,001
The allure
of a life rightly lived.

1683
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,363
That's not me.
You know it isn't.

1684
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:59,364
So, what's the plan?

1685
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:02,326
I have absolutely no idea...

1686
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,687
but I'm excited to find out.

1687
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,964
You know, you...

1688
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,170
You may not be the myth
we made you out to be...

1689
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,405
but you're still
pretty something.

1690
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,121
You're pretty something
yourself.

1691
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,562
You could come with me,
you know.

1692
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,045
You can't imagine
how many times

1693
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,566
I dreamed
you would say those words.

1694
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,085
But I have to go.

1695
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,881
Hey.

1696
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,844
Do you want to
call your sister?

1697
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,729
She misses you.

1698
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,126
We talk every day.

1699
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,690
I'll see you.

1700
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,848
<i>What a treacherous thing it is</i>

1701
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,161
<i>to believe that a person
is more than a person.</i>

1702
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:57,647
<i>Margo was not a miracle.
She was not an adventurer.</i>

1703
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,851
<i>She was not some fine,
precious thing.</i>

1704
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,161
<i>She was a girl.</i>

1705
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:17,443
<i>It took me a long time
to realize how wrong I was.</i>

1706
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,723
<i>And not just about Margo.</i>

1707
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,127
<i>I was wrong about
a lot of things.</i>

1708
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,931
<i>I used to believe
everyone gets a miracle.</i>

1709
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,165
<i>And I still do.</i>

1710
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,842
<i>But as it turns out...</i>

1711
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,324
<i>my miracle...</i>

1712
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,170
<i>was this.</i>

1713
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,003
<i>Don't stop, no
I'll never give up</i>

1714
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,442
<i>And I'll never look back
just hold your head up</i>

1715
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,807
<i>And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough</i>

1716
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:01,921
<i>They keep saying</i>

1717
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,604
<i>Don't stop no,
it's never enough</i>

1718
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,002
<i>I'll never look back
never give up</i>

1719
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,567
<i>And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough</i>

1720
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,886
<i>But now I'm falling, falling</i>

1721
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,689
<i>Falling, falling, falling</i>

1722
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,448
<i>Falling, falling
falling, falling, oh</i>

1723
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:20,244
<i>Now we're going down</i>

1724
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:25,803
<i>And I can feel the eyes
are watching us so closely</i>

1725
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,763
<i>I'm trying
not to make a sound</i>

1726
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:34,288
<i>'Cause I'll be found out
somehow</i>

1727
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,929
<i>Don't stop, no
I'll never give up</i>

1728
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,122
<i>And I'll never look back
just hold your head up</i>

1729
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,043
<i>And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough</i>

1730
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,444
<i>Don't stop
no it's never enough</i>

1731
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,529
<i>I'll never look back
never give up</i>

1732
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:50,968
<i>And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough</i>

1733
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,726
<i>So maybe we won't
all win the lottery.</i>

1734
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:01,961
<i>Or marry royalty.</i>

1735
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,322
<i>Or make that last-second shot.</i>

1736
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,651
<i>But that doesn't mean we won't
have amazing adventures...</i>

1737
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,881
Aw...

1738
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,481
I want one.

1739
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,847
<i>...meet exceptional people...</i>

1740
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,047
<i>and make indelible memories.</i>

1741
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,447
<i>The trick is...</i>

1742
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,685
<i>to notice.</i>

1743
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,367
<i>Before it's too late.</i>

1744
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,925
<i>Oh, and Margo?</i>

1745
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:50,169
<i>Someone said they
saw her in New York,</i>

1746
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,811
<i>starring in a revival
of</i> The Fantasticks.

1747
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:57,047
<i>Someone else said
she's on the West Coast</i>

1748
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,521
<i>teaching surf lessons
in Malibu.</i>

1749
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,368
<i>I don't listen to those
rumors anymore.</i>

1750
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,040
<i>Wherever she is...</i>

1751
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,769
<i>whatever she's up to...</i>

1752
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:22,722
<i>I'm sure it's
pretty something.</i>

1753
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,925
<i>But, hey...</i>

1754
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,802
<i>that's her story to tell.</i>

1755
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:38,321
<i>I know it's
not the right time tonight</i>

1756
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:41,449
<i>But I won't move until this
stops</i>

1757
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:44,040
<i>Go back to the top</i>

1758
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,968
<i>Back to the top</i>

1759
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:57,242
<i>I'm not scared if you
run to me</i>

1760
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:00,201
<i>Lost like when you were mine</i>

1761
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,607
<i>You can take
what you want from me</i>

1762
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:13,084
<i>Just don't
offer me your time</i>

1763
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:22,122
<i>Stay, life can be long</i>

1764
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:27,411
<i>Wanna know, wanna know wanna
know, wanna know it's true</i>

1765
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:33,247
<i>When you say
I want you around</i>

1766
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,644
<i>Gotta make me believe you</i>

1767
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:45,045
<i>I know it's
not the right time tonight</i>

1768
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:48,203
<i>But I won't move until this
stops</i>

1769
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,721
<i>Go back to the top</i>

1770
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,448
<i>Back to the top</i>

1771
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,971
<i>I know it's
not the right time tonight</i>

1772
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,089
<i>But I won't move until this
stops</i>

1773
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,322
<i>Go back to the top</i>

1774
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:19,528
<i>Back to the top</i>
