1
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,982
<i>His name was j.B. Books,</i>

2
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,785
<i>And he had</i>
<i>a matched pair of .45s</i>

3
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,153
<i>With antique ivory grips</i>

4
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,555
<i>That were something</i>
<i>to behold...</i>

5
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,858
<i>But he wasn't</i>
<i>an outlaw.</i>

6
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,760
<i>Fact is,</i>
<i>for a while,</i>

7
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,462
<i>He was a lawman.</i>

8
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,768
<i>Long before I met mr. Books,</i>
<i>he was a famous man.</i>

9
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,372
<i>I guess his fame was</i>
<i>why somebody or other</i>

10
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,407
<i>Was always after him.</i>

11
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:22,214
<i>The wild country</i>
<i>had taught him to survive.</i>

12
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,719
Hyah!

13
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,823
<i>He lived his life</i>
<i>and herded by himself.</i>

14
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,827
<i>He had a credo</i>
<i>that went...</i>

15
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,996
[j.B. Books] <i>I won't be</i>
<i>wronged. I won't be insulted.</i>

16
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,399
<i>I won't be</i>
<i>laid a hand on.</i>

17
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,968
<i>I don't do these things</i>
<i>to other people.</i>

18
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,671
<i>I require</i>
<i>the same from them.</i>

19
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,389
You hold it right there.

20
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,491
Give me your wallet.

21
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,896
Take it a little easy
with that cannon, mister.

22
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,301
Just throw me
your wallet.

23
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,335
Yes, sir,

24
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,637
And a little
something extra.

25
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,344
You done murdered me.

26
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,946
No, but you're
going to have

27
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,114
A long winter bellyache,
you boob.

28
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,916
Give me that wallet.

29
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,157
Just the wallet.

30
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,226
I can hardly move.

31
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,729
You done shot a hole
in my stomach.

32
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,700
I appreciate that.

33
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,935
You ain't going
to leave me here.

34
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,303
Well, it's quite obvious

35
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,939
That's what you were
going to do to me.

36
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,976
Get out of the way.

37
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:07,045
Mister, you better find
yourself another line of work.

38
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,616
This one sure don't
fit your pistol.

39
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,460
Hey, mister,
want a paper?

40
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,096
Yeah, I will, son.

41
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,898
Queen victoria's dead.

42
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,103
There you are.

43
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,705
Thank you.

44
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,285
Whoa.

45
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,820
Hey!

46
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,755
Hey, you!

47
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,590
Hey, methuselah,

48
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,126
Move that cack
out of the way.

49
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,595
Are you
talking to me?

50
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,698
Yeah, you dumb bastard.

51
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,900
Move it, or I'll
deliver you something

52
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,101
To remember me by.

53
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:39,304
Well, now, pardon me
all to hell.

54
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,806
Giddyup!

55
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,175
Buster.

56
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,176
Whoa.

57
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,677
Try it.

58
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,217
Come on, jay, the old man
ain't worth the bullet.

59
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,653
He looks
all tuckered out.

60
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,490
Giddyup.

61
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,962
You're right there, son.

62
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,534
[ring ring
ring ring]

63
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,243
Doc hostetler.

64
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,812
John bernard books.

65
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:54,913
You remembered.

66
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,616
The newspapers
occasionally remind me.

67
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:00,218
Wh-what was it,
15 years ago?

68
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,621
The only time
I was ever hit--

69
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,689
Right here
at the acme saloon.

70
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,224
You killed two men.

71
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,660
I'm damn lucky
you were around.

72
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,229
That second one
nearly did me in,

73
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,932
Coming out of nowhere
like that.

74
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,836
You must have the
constitution of an ox.

75
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,604
Well, we'll see.

76
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,807
That's what
I'm here for.

77
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,074
Oh?

78
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:30,315
About 10 days ago
in creede, colorado,

79
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,651
I hadn't been feeling
up to snuff,

80
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,554
So I went to see
a sawbones there.

81
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:36,655
He, uh...

82
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,491
Well, the next day
I got on my horse

83
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,660
And took off
to find you.

84
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:45,730
And what did my
colleague in creede say?

85
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,400
Examine me,
and I'll tell you.

86
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,101
You don't trust me.

87
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,437
Oh, doc,
you saved my life.

88
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,272
You don't trust
my profession.

89
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,942
In my profession,
you trust too much,

90
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:00,378
You don't celebrate
many birthdays.

91
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,948
I kind of like it
around here.

92
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,852
All right,
I'll examine you.

93
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:10,922
Take your clothes off
down to your long johns.

94
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,459
Now, I, uh...

95
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,462
If I'm to know
what to look for,

96
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:21,066
You'll have to tell me
what's ailing you.

97
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,601
Well, I hurt, doc,

98
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:25,670
Way down deep
in my back.

99
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,239
Not all the time,

100
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,574
But now and then
suddenly.

101
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,511
Pain in the lumbar
vertebrae?

102
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,045
Like sin.

103
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,882
All right, whenever
you get ready,

104
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:41,086
Just...Bend over
the table there,

105
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,921
Trapdoor down.

106
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,650
Well?

107
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,520
Books, every few days

108
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,522
I have to tell a man
or a woman

109
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,524
Something
I don't want to.

110
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,927
I've been practicing
medicine for 29 years,

111
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,530
And I still don't know
how to do it well.

112
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,600
Why don't you just
say it flat out?

113
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,369
All right.

114
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,338
You have a cancer--

115
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,707
Advanced.

116
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:47,018
Is that what that fella
up at creede told you?

117
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,286
Yeah.

118
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,256
And you didn't
believe him.

119
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,592
No.

120
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,560
Do you believe me?

121
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:58,363
Can't you
cut it out, doc?

122
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,968
I'd have to gut you
like a fish.

123
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,339
Well, what can you do?

124
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,577
There's...
Just, uh...

125
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,647
Very little
I can do.

126
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,318
Uh, if... When
the pain gets too bad,

127
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,654
I can give you
something.

128
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,992
What you're trying
to tell me

129
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,493
Is that I...

130
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,895
Yeah.

131
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,699
Damn.

132
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,769
I'm sorry, books.

133
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,943
You told me I was
strong as an ox.

134
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,946
Well, even an ox dies.

135
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,552
How much time
do I have?

136
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:58,823
Two months...
Six weeks--less.

137
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,226
There's no way
to tell.

138
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,296
Well, what can I...

139
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,866
What will I
be able to do?

140
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,969
Oh, anything
you want at first.

141
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:14,706
Then, later on,
you won't want to.

142
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,176
How much later?

143
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,577
You'll know when.

144
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,880
You'll have to
get off your feet

145
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,281
And get some rest.

146
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,418
Have you made any kind of
arrangements for a room?

147
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,054
No. I just
got in town.

148
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,623
You might try
the widow rogers.

149
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,626
She's got a place down
the street a fair piece.

150
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,194
She takes in lodgers.

151
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,629
She's a nice woman.

152
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,164
She needs the help.

153
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,132
I'll give it a try.

154
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,534
Do me a favor.

155
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,869
Don't tell anybody
I'm in town.

156
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,406
Oh, no, but if I wanted
to go unnoticed,

157
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:52,277
I don't think I'd walk
around with this thing.

158
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,749
Stole it from
a whorehouse in creede.

159
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,117
Did you?

160
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,404
Hello.

161
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,207
This the rogers place?

162
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,176
Yeah.

163
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,511
Ma!

164
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,280
You can tell
your mother

165
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,751
That a tuckered-out
old man needs a room.

166
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,519
[door shuts]

167
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:38,723
Good afternoon, sir.

168
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,458
Afternoon.

169
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,463
Doc hostetler says you
might be able to help me.

170
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,865
How kind of him.

171
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,300
Yes, sir, I have
one room available.

172
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,902
Good.

173
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,005
[whinnies]

174
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,641
Downstairs
in the rear.

175
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,009
$8.00 by the week.

176
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,578
$2.00 per day if
you're not permanent.

177
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,447
Well, I'm not
permanent, ma'am.

178
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,017
Oh, boy, get my gear and
the saddlebags off that horse

179
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,953
And bring them
into the house.

180
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,058
Gillom will be happy
to do that.

181
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,471
The parlor
is yours to use

182
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,839
And the telephone.

183
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,974
My other lodgers
have rooms upstairs.

184
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,277
Two railroad men
and a schoolteacher.

185
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,613
I'll introduce them
at supper.

186
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,515
My kitchen.

187
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,586
And the bathroom.

188
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:43,988
I thought
that's what it was.

189
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,591
We do have
running water,

190
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,994
Also in the washbowl
in here.

191
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,096
Nice-looking brass bed.

192
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,732
I hope it hasn't
got any, uh...

193
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,601
It isn't ticky, is it?

194
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,604
It certainly is not.

195
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:00,939
This is very comfortable.

196
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,274
I'll take my meals
right here.

197
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,610
I serve
in the dining room.

198
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,111
I'll pay you extra.

199
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:10,548
Very well, since
you're not permanent.

200
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,118
This suit's got a lot
of countryside on it.

201
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,188
I'd like to have it
brushed before morning.

202
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,122
[footsteps]

203
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:21,593
I'll take
those saddlebags.

204
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,995
That bedroll you can
leave outside.

205
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,598
No. I have my other things
wrapped in it.

206
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,633
They'll need
some soap and water.

207
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,034
Have you a barn?

208
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,636
No, we don't.

209
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,738
Boy, take my horse over--

210
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,140
My name's gillom.
It's not "boy."

211
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,709
It's gillom rogers,

212
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,212
And I don't like
being ordered around.

213
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,452
Well, that's fair enough,
gillom rogers.

214
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:51,489
Would you be so kind
as to take old dollar

215
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,024
Over to
the livery stable

216
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:57,028
And see that he gets
a double order of oats?

217
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,031
O.K.

218
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,772
You seem to be a man

219
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,641
Accustomed
to giving orders.

220
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,010
I guess it is
a bad habit of mine.

221
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,945
I didn't
get your name.

222
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,080
I didn't give it.

223
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,849
Is it so important?

224
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,852
For anyone living under
my roof, it is.

225
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,420
Well, all right.

226
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,690
It's, uh...Hickok,

227
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,492
William hickok.

228
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,695
Where do you hail from,
mr. Hickok?

229
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,063
Abilene, kansas.

230
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,699
And what
do you do there?

231
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,968
I'm a u.S. Marshal.

232
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,569
Oh, that's nice.

233
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,071
No, it isn't.

234
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,074
I'm glad you're not
staying long, mr. Hickok.

235
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,543
I'm not sure
I like you.

236
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,946
Not many do,
mrs. Rogers.

237
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:04,095
Moses, where did you hide
the whiskey this time?

238
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,231
Third drawer from
the left, gilly boy.

239
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,414
Gilly, fetch me
my spectacles.

240
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,732
What the hell
are you doing?

241
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:43,201
You watch
your language, boy.

242
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,348
[laughter]

243
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:05,289
J.B. Books is
in my house.

244
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,758
Hey.

245
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,660
My name is books.

246
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,396
Y'all get that?

247
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,965
Bang!

248
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,600
Bang!

249
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,468
Bang!

250
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,936
Bang!

251
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,471
Bang!

252
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,773
Boom!

253
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,308
He's in my house.

254
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,115
Ma!

255
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,618
Ma, I got to
tell you something.

256
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,053
Shh. Close the door.

257
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,554
What's happened?

258
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,590
Who do you think--

259
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,160
Oh, gillom, you've
been drinking again.

260
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,629
Do you know
who he is?

261
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:45,663
William hickok--

262
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:49,067
United states marshal
in abilene, kansas.

263
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,035
Ma,
wild bill hickok

264
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,439
Was shot
before I was born.

265
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,176
We got
j.B. Books here.

266
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,678
He's killed 30 men.

267
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,015
Gillom, go to your room.

268
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:07,585
Go on. Go to bed before
you wake the house.

269
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,387
Good night, ma.

270
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,256
Whoo.

271
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,496
[knock on door]

272
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,164
Come in.

273
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,600
Mr. Books?

274
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,035
Oh, my clothes.

275
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,671
Thank you, m--

276
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,207
You are j.B. Books.

277
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,110
That's right.

278
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,481
May I ask
how you found out?

279
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,283
I've been up all night
because of you.

280
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,053
I demand that you
pack and leave.

281
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,622
That is not possible.

282
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,457
And why not?

283
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,194
I don't
propose to say.

284
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,863
That means you won't go.

285
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,197
No.

286
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,032
And that is
your last word?

287
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,435
Mrs. Rogers,
you have a fine color

288
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,872
When you're
on the scrap.

289
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,648
[ring]

290
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,450
[ring]

291
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:16,053
Central, give me
the city marshal's office.

292
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,489
Thank you.

293
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,170
Come in, marshal.

294
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,879
My name's thibido,

295
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,414
Marshal
walter thibido.

296
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:47,285
I'm told...
You are j.B. Books.

297
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,920
You were told right.

298
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,321
Have a seat.

299
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,889
Don't think I will.

300
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,292
Breathe easy, marshal.

301
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,261
You're closer to your gun
than I am to mine.

302
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,631
Books, carson city's
full of hard cases--

303
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,500
Is your head cold?

304
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,634
Huh?

305
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,569
Oh.

306
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:07,004
Books, carson city's
full of hard cases

307
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,174
Who'd sell their souls to
put your name on the wall.

308
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:13,544
You'll draw trouble like
an outhouse draws flies.

309
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,880
I checked my bulletins
before I come over

310
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,916
And didn't find nothing
I can hold you for,

311
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,085
But I want you
out of town--

312
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,453
Directly, today.

313
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,056
Maybe I'm not
so inclined.

314
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,725
Then, by god,
I will incline you.

315
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,761
I can badge
as many men as I need.

316
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,931
We'll smoke you out or
carry you out feet first,

317
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,667
So you say which,
mr. Gunman.

318
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,669
It's your funeral.

319
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,904
Soon, yes.

320
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,105
Huh?

321
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,673
I can't go.

322
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,708
Can't?

323
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,478
I'm going to die
right here in this room.

324
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,449
Ha! That's too thin.

325
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,484
I wish you were right.

326
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,120
Would you believe
doc hostetler?

327
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,989
That's his verdict.

328
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,493
You don't say?

329
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,962
You don't sa--
goddamn!

330
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,130
Whoo!

331
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,999
Whooee!

332
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,767
I tell you
the god's plain truth--

333
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,803
When I come through that door,
I was scared.

334
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:16,641
I know what a man like you is
capable of when he's cornered.

335
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,943
I wondered
who'd get my job,

336
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,946
If the council would give
my wife a pension,

337
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,815
And if it would snow
the day they put me under.

338
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:28,286
Excuse me if I don't
pull a long face. I can't.

339
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,453
You talk too much.

340
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,522
As much as I damn please.

341
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,958
How long does
hostetler give you?

342
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,160
He doesn't know.
But you can do me a favor.

343
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,396
I owe you one--
or hostetler.

344
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:41,532
My being here--
maybe that's news,

345
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,135
But dying
is my own business.

346
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,837
Keep it under your hat,
will you?

347
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,374
All right. Just don't take
too long to die.

348
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:53,411
Be a gent and
convenience everybody

349
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,713
And do it soon.

350
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,051
You've worn out
your welcome.

351
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,452
Scat.

352
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,426
The day they
lay you away,

353
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,861
What I'll do
on your grave

354
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,697
Won't pass
for flowers.

355
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,983
You damn little sneak.

356
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,219
How long
were you out there?

357
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,221
I was just
passing by.

358
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,656
You spy on me,

359
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:41,125
And I'll nail you
to a tree.

360
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,526
You've already
told your mother.

361
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,729
Who else have you
blabbed to?

362
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,030
Jay cobb.

363
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,265
Are you all right,
mr. Books?

364
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,167
I can't abide
a skulker.

365
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,636
You want to see me,

366
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,606
Knock on my door
like a man.

367
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,174
I will.
Sure you're all right?

368
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,442
If there's anything

369
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,010
I can do for you,
just let me know.

370
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,813
It's an honor to have you
in this house.

371
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,515
I'm afraid
your mother doesn't agree.

372
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:07,651
She doesn't know
how a man feels.

373
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,554
You're the most famous person
to ever come into in this town.

374
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,523
When I was a boy,

375
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,526
I heard all about your shootout
at the acme saloon.

376
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,995
I just never thought
I'd get the chance to meet you.

377
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,297
There's more
to being a man

378
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,665
Than handling a gun.

379
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:24,468
Don't you have
something to do?

380
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,472
I was just headed over to
cobb's creamery right now.

381
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,041
I help jay with
deliveries sometimes.

382
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,077
That was
the nice gentleman

383
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,478
You were with
yesterday.

384
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,080
Where's your mother?

385
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,516
She's in the kitchen,
I think.

386
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:40,151
Well, goodbye, sir.

387
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,753
It was real nice
meeting you.

388
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,088
Goodbye.

389
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:06,510
Mrs. Rogers, I, uh...
Hope you'll forgive me

390
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:09,013
For taking hickok's name.

391
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:12,616
I thought it was
pretty funny at the time,

392
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,454
But after reflection...

393
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,790
It wasn't such a joke,
and I apologize.

394
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,724
You should.

395
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,794
The only way you can
show your repentance

396
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,196
Is to leave.

397
00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:27,932
Well, that
I cannot do.

398
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:31,435
Mr. Books, you are
a notorious individual

399
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,038
Utterly lacking
in character or decency.

400
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,272
You're an assassin.

401
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,442
That's according to which end
of the gun you're on.

402
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,444
Rubbish. You lied to me,
you made a fool of me.

403
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,847
You took advantage of me.
This house is all I have.

404
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,015
If my lodgers
find out who you are,

405
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,150
They'll leave.

406
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,918
I have a cancer.

407
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,656
I'm dying of it.

408
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,963
I know what
you'll be thinking--

409
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:02,166
That I'll be
a lot of trouble.

410
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,534
Well, I won't.

411
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,970
You just
bring me my meals,

412
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:08,973
And I'll see
to the other needs.

413
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:12,510
I promise you
I won't be a burden.

414
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:19,350
Mrs. Rogers, I'm
in a kind of a tight--

415
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,552
I'll make it
worth your while.

416
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:25,055
I can pay $4.00 a day
for the room.

417
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,159
Oh, mr. Books.

418
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:05,029
Most pleased to meet you,
sir, and honored.

419
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:08,032
What did you want
to see me about?

420
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,567
The name is dobkins.
Dan dobkins.

421
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,602
I'm with
<i>the morning appeal.</i>

422
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,237
Mr. Dobkins,
sit down.

423
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,238
Thank you.

424
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,205
Um...

425
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,041
We ran the story
this morning

426
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,610
That you were here
at mrs. Rogers'

427
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,645
And enjoying our
salubrious winter climate

428
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,647
And so on and so forth.

429
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:24,949
Have you seen it?

430
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:25,749
No.

431
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,052
It's page one,
I assure you.

432
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,621
I bought a copy of your paper
when I arrived.

433
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:33,057
Still reading about
queen victoria dying.

434
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:33,857
Oh.

435
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,460
What can I do for you?

436
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,329
That's what
I came to talk to you about.

437
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:39,797
Well, that's
what I figured.

438
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,165
You must
appreciate, sir,

439
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:44,401
That you are the most
celebrated shootist extant.

440
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,836
Extant?

441
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,138
Uh, still existing,

442
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,273
Alive.

443
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,543
Yes, and your reputation
is nationwide.

444
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:55,546
My story went out over
the wires this morning.

445
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:58,148
Every daily of consequence
will run it,

446
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,416
But they'll want more,

447
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,585
The papers in
the east, in particular.

448
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,953
Between us, mr. Books,

449
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:07,057
We can really put
carson city on the map.

450
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:11,061
Mr. Dobkins, you're going
the long way around the barn.

451
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:11,895
Yes, sir.

452
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,497
I would
like tremendously

453
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,666
To do a series
of stories on you.

454
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:16,634
A series?

455
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:19,703
Yes. Uh, how long
will you be with us?

456
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:23,641
Not as long
as I'd like to be.

457
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,644
Oh, well, we could
start today, right now,

458
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,545
Then get together
again tomorrow.

459
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,680
You see,

460
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:32,216
There's been so much
cheap fiction about gunmen.

461
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:35,552
I want to get down to
the true story for once,

462
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,954
While you're available,

463
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,790
Before anything
happens to you.

464
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:42,026
I mean,
I hope nothing does.

465
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,193
Go on.

466
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:46,797
I want to cover
your career factually.

467
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,866
The statistics,
you might say.

468
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,368
Then I'd delve into the
psychological aspects--

469
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,938
What turned you to violence
in the first place?

470
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,975
Are you by nature
bloodthirsty?

471
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:01,979
Uh, do you, uh, brood
after the deed is done,

472
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,381
Or have you lived
so long with death

473
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,551
That you're used to it?
The death of others?

474
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,553
The prospect
of your own?

475
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:11,588
Make like
that's a nipple.

476
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,956
One fit or fidget

477
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:16,593
And mrs. Rogers is going
to be scrubbing your brains

478
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,162
Off the wallpaper.

479
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:19,596
On your feet.

480
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:20,564
Back up.

481
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:23,567
Now, we're heading
for the front door.

482
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,403
Now, don't you shake,
shiver, or sneeze.

483
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,573
Mr. Books, what in heaven's
name are you doing?

484
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:32,176
Ma'am, we have
a touchy situation here.

485
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:33,711
Out.

486
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,615
Turn around.

487
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:39,616
Mmm.

488
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:40,617
Turn around.

489
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,186
Bend over.

490
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:43,153
Yes, sir.

491
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:46,990
Dobkins, you are a prying,
pipsqueaking ass,

492
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:51,862
And if you ever come
dandying around here again--

493
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,472
That was
a savage thing to do.

494
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:02,840
Maybe...

495
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,211
Mr. Books?

496
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,115
I'll tend myself.

497
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,553
First things first, doc.

498
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,589
I almost forgot
to ask you.

499
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,958
How much do I owe you?

500
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,961
You're a man after
my own heart, books.

501
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:27,598
Most of them ask
that last, if at all.

502
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,966
Well, let's see.

503
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:32,002
We'll make it $4.00
for the two visits

504
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,172
Plus $1.00 for that.

505
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:36,607
What's that?

506
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,975
They call that laudanum,

507
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:42,579
A solution of opium
and alcohol.

508
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,849
Opium, that can
get to be a habit.

509
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,585
Why, absolutely,
an addiction.

510
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,054
How does it taste?

511
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,457
Just--just awful,
terrible,

512
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:57,628
But it's the most potent
painkiller we've got.

513
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,464
How much of it
do I take?

514
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,601
Well, as much as you need
when you need it.

515
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:05,969
I think a spoonful

516
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,605
Would be all right
to start with.

517
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:09,673
Later?

518
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:10,841
I don't know,

519
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,409
But I--I
think one morning

520
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:15,412
You're just going
to wake up and say,

521
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:20,984
"here I am in this bed,
and here I'm going to stay."

522
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,488
Hostetler,
I want to know.

523
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,590
Well, unless you insist,

524
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:29,426
I'd rather not talk
about it.

525
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:34,498
Well, I want to know.

526
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,632
All right.

527
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,000
There'll be an increase

528
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,436
In the severity
of the pain

529
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:44,308
In your lower spine,
your hips, your groin.

530
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,609
You--

531
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:49,580
Do you--do you
want me to go on?

532
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,618
The pain will
become unbearable.

533
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,054
Uh, no drug
will moderate it.

534
00:30:57,056 --> 00:31:00,824
If you're lucky,
you'll lose consciousness,

535
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,260
And until then,
you'll scream.

536
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,470
I--I--I'm sorry.

537
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:17,040
I--I didn't mean to
be specific like this.

538
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,643
The next time,
I'll go to mrs. Rogers.

539
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,678
You--you--
you just telephone.

540
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,481
You just telephone.

541
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:30,053
There--there's
one more thing I'd say.

542
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:34,658
Both of us have had
a lot to do with death.

543
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,228
I'm not a brave man,
but you must be.

544
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,062
Ah.

545
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,065
Now--now--now,
this is not advice.

546
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,067
It's not
even a suggestion.

547
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,937
It's just something
for you to reflect on

548
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,273
While your mind's
still clear.

549
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:50,440
What?

550
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:55,379
I would not die a death
like I just described.

551
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:56,747
No?

552
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,883
Not if I
had your courage.

553
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,985
Oh.

554
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,957
Thanks.

555
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,046
[knock on door]

556
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,316
Come in, mrs. Rogers.

557
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,184
Oh, mr. Books, I--

558
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,486
I'm beginning
to know your knock.

559
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,789
I was reading
about old queen vic.

560
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:42,659
Well, maybe she
outlived her time.

561
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:45,062
Maybe she was
a museum piece,

562
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,664
But she never
lost her dignity

563
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,099
Nor sold her guns.

564
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:53,403
She hung on to her pride
and went out in style.

565
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,974
That's the kind of
an old gal I'd like to meet.

566
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,643
Mrs. Rogers,
are you afraid of me?

567
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,612
Well, to be frank, yes.

568
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:07,417
All these guns and
the kind of man you are.

569
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,620
Maybe you're afraid
of too many things.

570
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:15,492
But I'm sure there's plenty
of starch in your corset.

571
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:19,963
Mr. Books, I came here
to see what you can eat,

572
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,132
If you can have
what I'm serving tonight.

573
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,233
No, you didn't.

574
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,869
I wish you'd stop
contradicting me.

575
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:28,372
I wish you'd say
what you mean.

576
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,842
Very well.

577
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,778
I apologize for
the unchristian things

578
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,313
I've said and done.

579
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:40,684
I'm sorry, and I'll do
whatever I can for you.

580
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,720
Well, thank you. I...

581
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,991
All my life,
I've been too proud

582
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,394
To take help
from anyone.

583
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,662
Guess I'll
have to learn.

584
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,765
Would you, uh...

585
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:57,601
Sit down for a moment?

586
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,102
Please do.

587
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,108
What's that?

588
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,344
Laudanum.

589
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,782
Doc hostetler's remedy.

590
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:13,750
That's habit-forming,
isn't it?

591
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,956
Mrs. Rogers, would
you go for a drive

592
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:22,359
In the country
with me tomorrow?

593
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:24,928
Oh, I--I couldn't,
but thank you.

594
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,229
I wish you'd reconsider.

595
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,132
It would only be
for an hour or two.

596
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,368
No. I appreciate
the invitation, but no.

597
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,371
Is it that you don't want
to be alone with me?

598
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,373
It's not that,
I assure you.

599
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:40,110
It's just that I've only
been a widow for a year.

600
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:41,144
People would--

601
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,179
People!

602
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,514
If I have to work
on your sympathy, I will.

603
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:47,384
I want to go out
in the world again

604
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:50,387
And see trees, lakes,
hills, and the sky,

605
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,989
And I don't fancy
seeing it alone.

606
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:56,159
I've been full
of alone lately.

607
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:02,032
Besides, there's a threat
of snow in the air.

608
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:04,968
Since I moved in here,

609
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,571
We've been scratching
at each other

610
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,372
And apologizing.

611
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:12,309
Well, let's see
if we can't do better.

612
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:16,847
Damn it. I wish to hell
you'd ride with me.

613
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:20,383
I apologize
for my language.

614
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,653
I'll go with you.

615
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,156
Good.

616
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:28,125
Tomorrow at 10:00?

617
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,995
Will you get, please,
mr. Gillom rogers

618
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:33,663
To trot down
to the stable

619
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:38,001
And get us the best horse
and buggy they have?

620
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,002
I will.

621
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,905
I'm much obliged, ma'am.

622
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,527
Good evening.

623
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,890
Deuce is the dead card.

624
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,258
8 is your winner,

625
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,295
And the lovely queen,
the loser.

626
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:39,629
Hellfire!

627
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,831
That makes seven
turnovers in a row.

628
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,401
Pulford, j.B. Books
over at mrs. Rogers.

629
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:45,869
That was
yesterday's news.

630
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,338
But I just heard
he's dying.

631
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,242
Friend of mine got it
from marshal thibido.

632
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:55,579
Old books is cashing in.

633
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,281
That's hard news.

634
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:01,117
That's a man
I could have taken.

635
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,118
Ha!

636
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,186
My ass.

637
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,421
You have two ways

638
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:07,157
Of leaving this
establishment, my friend--

639
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,925
Immediately or dead.

640
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,038
Gentlemen, place your bets.

641
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,674
Place your bets,
gentlemen.

642
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,647
Look out!

643
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,542
43...

644
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:00,510
44...

645
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:01,544
45...

646
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,545
46...

647
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:03,346
47...48.

648
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:04,981
Clean through
the heart!

649
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,449
Hey, pulford!

650
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,785
Over 80 feet!

651
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,787
Hooray!
Hooray!

652
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,362
Oh, mighty handsome,
ma'am.

653
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,798
Moses had to dust
this buggy off.

654
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,001
He says he don't
rent it too often.

655
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,002
Doesn't.

656
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:26,970
Doesn't.

657
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,805
Except just
for funerals.

658
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,408
Well, thank you, gillom.

659
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,809
I appreciate this.

660
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,979
I want that wood chopped
by the time we get back.

661
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,415
Oh, ma, I was
going to go on--

662
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,582
Yes, ma'am.

663
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,784
Hyah.

664
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,016
That is beauty.

665
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,418
It is a little chilly
up here.

666
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,454
Would you like
the top raised?

667
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,089
No, thank you.

668
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,897
You all right?

669
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:30,633
I will be in a minute.

670
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,669
Can I help you?

671
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:35,872
I've had plenty
of practice.

672
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,618
Why don't you
get married again?

673
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,053
What?

674
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,021
I think you heard me.

675
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,857
That's none
of your affair.

676
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,860
I haven't time to
be polite, mrs. Rogers.

677
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:59,863
Well, for one thing,
I haven't been asked.

678
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:02,465
For another,
I loved my husband

679
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,200
And still do.

680
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:05,668
How did he die?

681
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,836
Stroke, they think.

682
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,039
They found him slumped
at his desk.

683
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,441
He was lucky.

684
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,009
He was 41.

685
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:15,412
Did he have time
to, uh...

686
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:17,781
Did he leave you
any security?

687
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,417
I have the property
and the house,

688
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,786
Which he built
with a bank loan,

689
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:23,686
And gillom.

690
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,455
And he worries you.

691
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:26,856
Yeah, he certainly does,

692
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:30,059
Particularly when he
complains about being bored

693
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:30,994
And needing excitement.

694
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:33,863
Well, I wouldn't
be too hard on him.

695
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,865
Every young man
feels the need

696
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,568
To let the badger loose
now and again.

697
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,037
I try to reason
with him. I can't.

698
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,439
I can only
mother him.

699
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,374
That's not
what he wants.

700
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:46,876
Like I said,
<i>that</i> you can change.

701
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,712
Don't you have enough
worries of your own?

702
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,714
A few, but in general,

703
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:55,585
I've had a hell
of a good time.

704
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,455
Tell me, um...

705
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:01,024
What does the j.B.
Stand for?

706
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:02,091
John bernard.

707
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,093
And yours?

708
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:08,698
That's a crackerjack
of a name for a woman.

709
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,467
How do you do, bond?

710
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:13,102
How do you do,
john bernard?

711
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,204
Shall we?

712
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:15,538
Hyah!

713
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,489
Good morning,
mrs. Rogers!

714
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:34,057
Mr. Sweeney.

715
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:36,292
Mike sweeney?

716
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:39,162
John bernard books,

717
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,265
Now, I'm flattered
that you remembered me.

718
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,600
You live around here now?

719
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:46,102
My spread's in
the foothills to the west.

720
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:50,073
Well, you look just like
I remember the sweeneys--

721
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:51,674
Mean and ugly.

722
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,777
Well, I heard
that you were in town

723
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:58,181
For a very short time.

724
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,949
That's true.

725
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,217
Drop by.

726
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,253
We'll talk about old times.

727
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:04,821
The good old times.

728
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,756
Ha ha ha!

729
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,059
You can bring
your fancy pillow,

730
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:12,695
And your landlady
is welcome, too.

731
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,763
Now, my problem is

732
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,466
That she never
accepts my invitation,

733
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:20,904
And to you two,
I say goodbye.

734
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,744
I'm surprised
at the company you keep.

735
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:30,780
That man is no friend.
Quite the reverse.

736
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,482
How do you know him?

737
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:34,884
I don't.
I had some dealings

738
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,086
With his
brother albert once.

739
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:38,288
What happened?

740
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,492
That's what worries me,
john bernard--

741
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:44,761
The thought
of your victims.

742
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:47,764
What worried me
was survival.

743
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:51,100
Bond, I don't believe
I ever killed a man

744
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,502
That didn't deserve it.

745
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:55,939
Surely, only the lord
can judge that.

746
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,924
[dog barks]

747
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,632
[gunshot]

748
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,558
[dog barks]

749
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,926
Mr. Books!

750
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,195
Mr. Books?

751
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,932
[footsteps]

752
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,547
Sir?

753
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:46,082
Are you hurt?

754
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:47,450
No.

755
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,219
But they are.

756
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,222
Call the marshal.

757
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,796
He got both of them.

758
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:02,565
They came in through
the windows--guns blazing.

759
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:03,666
Close your robe.

760
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:06,369
He's so damn fast,
he killed them both.

761
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,572
John bernard books
in a shootout right here.

762
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,940
Son of a bitch!

763
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:13,943
I will not have that
language in my house.

764
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:16,679
Sorry, but this
is a great day.

765
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:18,848
Our house is
a part of history.

766
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,416
You've got
to know that.

767
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,251
That's nothing
to be proud of.

768
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,953
I love that old man.

769
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:25,455
Gillom! All right!

770
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:27,490
It's time you knew.

771
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:28,991
He's dying.

772
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:32,762
Who?

773
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,263
Mr. Books.

774
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,867
I don't believe it.

775
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,137
He has a cancer.

776
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,506
You're lying.

777
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:45,608
He would have told me.

778
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,176
But he didn't tell you!

779
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:48,878
He told me.

780
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,815
He's dying.

781
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,752
[sobbing]

782
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,359
Ma.

783
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,998
Ma.

784
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,771
You do understand?

785
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,739
That's the last of it.

786
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,875
Thank you,
mr. Hutchins.

787
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:20,910
My position
as a teacher,

788
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:22,311
As a maiden lady,

789
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:25,481
I'm obliged to move
to another place.

790
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:26,916
Of course.
I apologize.

791
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,885
We're ready to go!

792
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,887
Bye.

793
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:48,938
Some coffee?

794
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,940
Don't mind if I do.

795
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:53,109
Did you know those two?

796
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:53,943
Nope.

797
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,545
They sure knew you.

798
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:56,646
Who were they?

799
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,915
Ben shoup,
the one you killed

800
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,249
Trying to get out
the window.

801
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,651
The other,
name of norton--

802
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:04,053
Two no-goods, not
from around here.

803
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:05,955
I've never even heard
their names before.

804
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:07,056
Quite a night.

805
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,559
Your bedroom looks like
a slaughterhouse.

806
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:10,860
Oh, mrs. Rogers.

807
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,929
I'll post a man
outside nights.

808
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:15,364
That'll cost the taxpayers
$3.00 a night

809
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,034
And $10 apiece to
plant two corpses.

810
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,602
Death and taxes,
books.

811
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,904
Keeping you alive
long enough to die natural

812
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:23,906
Is costing us
a pretty penny.

813
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,509
There's no need
of any man outside.

814
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,810
I'd appreciate that,
marshal.

815
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:29,912
Thank you.

816
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:33,349
I--I can't tell you
how sorry I am

817
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,551
About what happened
last night.

818
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:36,953
That won't help.

819
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:38,921
Two men are dead.

820
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,558
I was defending myself.

821
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,532
How are you feeling,

822
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:51,367
A little more poorly
every day?

823
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,537
You've got a streak of
kindness a mile wide.

824
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,372
That I do.
Tell you what--

825
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,375
Maybe I can help
speed things along.

826
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:03,579
Did you read about the shooting
the night before last?

827
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:04,547
No.

828
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,549
Whooee! That
was some shooting.

829
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,551
Pulford, he's
the faro dealer,

830
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,553
Got off one round
under fire,

831
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:11,988
Straight
through the heart,

832
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,556
And it measured 84'3".

833
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,958
Maybe I'll just
send him here,

834
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,961
Let him deal you
a little faro.

835
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,129
You do that,
marshal.

836
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:21,397
This is 19-aught-1.

837
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,400
The old days are gone.
You don't know it.

838
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,402
We've got waterworks,
telephones, lights.

839
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,405
We'll have our streetcar
electrified by next year,

840
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,974
And we've started
to pave the streets.

841
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,410
We've still got
some weeding to do.

842
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:37,413
Once we're rid
of people like you,

843
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,016
We'll have a goddamn
garden of eden here.

844
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:41,984
To put it in a nutshell,

845
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:44,120
You've plain plumb
outlived your time.

846
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:47,523
You couldn't put it in
a barrel without a bottom.

847
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,393
You're the longest-winded
bastard I ever listened to.

848
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:52,962
I may be windy,
but I ain't ornery.

849
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:54,764
When my time comes
to die,

850
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:57,700
I won't drag it out.
I'll just do it.

851
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:58,834
Why don't you?

852
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,202
Thibido...

853
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,874
I don't scare anymore.

854
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:06,943
Neither did shoup
or norton.

855
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:10,279
You wouldn't gun down
a police officer.

856
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:14,550
What'd stop me,
fear of dying?

857
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,170

Moses?

867
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,447
Would you care
to do business

868
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,549
With a voice
from the grave?

869
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,051
Mr. Books!

870
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:23,953
It's pure pleasure
to groom your horse!

871
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:25,988
And even
a greater pleasure

872
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,356
To do business
with you!

873
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,525
Would you kindly
step into my office?

874
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,827
It'll be a pleasure.

875
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,596
Right this way, please.

876
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,633
Yes, sir.

877
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,102
Now, let me see

878
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:42,071
Where I put
my spectacles

879
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:45,574
Because I wouldn't
want to make no, uh...

880
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,543
Financial mistake.

881
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,180
Yes, sir.

882
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,983
Here they are, mr. Books.

883
00:50:53,985 --> 00:50:55,985
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

884
00:50:55,987 --> 00:50:57,753
$100.

885
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:00,189
That's a lot
of money, moses.

886
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:03,192
Who do I have--
what's this for?

887
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:05,528
What's it for?
For your horse.

888
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,097
My horse? I want
to sell my horse,

889
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,099
But this wouldn't
buy my saddle.

890
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,735
But, mr. Books,
you done agreed.

891
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:13,836
When?

892
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:15,204
When you sent gilly--

893
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:17,807
I mean, when mr. Rogers
said this morning

894
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:20,176
$100 would be
just fine with you.

895
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:22,812
I'll have to have a talk
with mr. Rogers.

896
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:25,314
As far as
the horse goes, it's 3.

897
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:27,083
300?

898
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:28,717
300.

899
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,354
I might maybe
can go 200.

900
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:34,790
You might maybe
go more than that

901
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:37,526
'cause you'll get more than
that 'cause it's mine.

902
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:38,794
3.

903
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,463
250.

904
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:43,732
3, and I'll throw
the saddle in for cash.

905
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,101
What about my bill?

906
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:47,069
You throw that in.

907
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,071
I ain't made of money.

908
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:52,741
Are we going to stand
here and haggle all day?

909
00:51:55,145 --> 00:52:00,082
Mr. Books, you the most
famous man I ever seen

910
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,684
And the second-best
haggler.

911
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:03,152
Who's the best?

912
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:04,887
Here I stand.

913
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,555
Well, let's get
to haggling.

914
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:09,291
Let's get to haggling.
All right.

915
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,261
Let's get to haggling.

916
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:14,296
1, 2, 3, 4.

917
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,466
That's 200. 200.

918
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,237
200 there.

919
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:27,610
20, 40, 60,
80, 90, 295.

920
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:28,911
No.

921
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:32,848
296?

922
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,083
No.

923
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:36,785
97?

924
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,655
98?

925
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:40,689
Sold.

926
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:43,292
You mean I did it?

927
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:47,196
Mr. Books, that makes me
the best haggler!

928
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:49,865
The best
in the world, moses.

929
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,500
Yes, sir.

930
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,303
Gillom!

931
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,308
Gillom!

932
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,243
Where's gillom?

933
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:02,845
In the woodshed.

934
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,680
That's appropriate.

935
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,048
Why?

936
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,384
You stay out of this.

937
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:17,293
Gillom!

938
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:18,928
I'm in here.

939
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,830
You'll account to me.

940
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,199
Sir?

941
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,670
You were trying
to cheat me,

942
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:31,240
And moses was trying
to cheat you.

943
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:33,242
I'm sorry.

944
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:36,645
I'm glad of that,
but it doesn't...

945
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,916
It doesn't tell me
very much.

946
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,820
She, uh...

947
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,725
She cried on my shoulder
this morning

948
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,527
On account of you.

949
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,598
I had to comfort her.

950
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,268
And then the lodgers
moved out.

951
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,270
Your room is a mess...

952
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:05,307
And now ma's worried
about losing the house.

953
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,277
Well, I just thought
that...

954
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:10,713
That maybe you might
want to do something

955
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:13,282
To try and make it up
to her.

956
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:15,284
I thought you might
be interested

957
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:17,920
In selling your horse
since you're...

958
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,922
Since I'm what?

959
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,827
You're dying.

960
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,398
How did you
find that out?

961
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,501
Ma told me.

962
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,272
Guess I'm the last one
in town

963
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:37,640
To know about it.

964
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:40,242
Don't you think you
should have talked to me

965
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,845
Before you tried
to sell my horse?

966
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,713
Yes, sir.

967
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,181
I suppose.

968
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:49,184
But I just wanted
to see first

969
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:52,187
If moses would buy it,
that's all.

970
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:54,590
I'm not a horse thief.

971
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,400
A man's emotions can...

972
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:07,469
Tangle him all up
sometimes.

973
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:12,141
I've been operating on
the raw edge lately, gillom.

974
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:16,945
Guess I just jumped
too far too fast...

975
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:22,685
But, son, I never thought
you were a horse thief.

976
00:55:22,687 --> 00:55:25,321
And I hope I can
hang around long enough

977
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:27,690
To make it up to you.

978
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,260
Sir...

979
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:33,195
Do you think...

980
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:36,965
Would you give me
a shooting lesson?

981
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:38,367
A shooting lesson?

982
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:42,471
Well, a man should know
how to handle a gun,

983
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,773
Use it with discretion.

984
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,342
But, uh...

985
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:49,411
You going to tell
your mother?

986
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,980
Well...Do I have to?

987
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:55,951
Come on, I'll get us
something to shoot with.

988
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,494
It's beautiful.

989
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:10,532
See that tree
on the left

990
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,101
With the divided trunk?

991
00:56:12,103 --> 00:56:13,502
You take the right side.

992
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,105
Aim well and put
five slugs in it.

993
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:17,506
Why not six?

994
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:20,442
You keep your hammer on
an empty chamber for safety.

995
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:23,445
And if you're going out
to face somebody?

996
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:26,448
Load six if your insides
tells you to.

997
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,617
Now, take your time.

998
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,037
That's good shooting,
gillom.

999
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,930
Hey, mr. Books,

1000
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:17,366
My spread's not much
bigger than yours.

1001
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:19,535
You did well.

1002
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:20,669
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

1003
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:24,072
Jay cobb lets me practice
with him by the lake...

1004
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:25,874
When he's not in jail.

1005
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:29,611
Day before yesterday, he
smashed some salesman's jaw.

1006
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,780
Nice employer
you have.

1007
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,283
Well, it's just
temporary...

1008
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:37,686
Till I find
whatever's right for me.

1009
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:38,487
Yeah.

1010
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:39,922
Wouldn't I like to see

1011
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:42,491
Him and jack pulford
go at it.

1012
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:45,093
Did you hear about
what pulford did?

1013
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,094
I did.

1014
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,262
Mr. Books.

1015
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:48,363
Yeah?

1016
00:57:48,365 --> 00:57:50,766
How did you ever kill
so many men?

1017
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:54,770
I lived most of my life
in the wild country,

1018
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:58,407
And you set a code
of laws to live by.

1019
00:57:58,409 --> 00:57:59,641
What laws?

1020
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,644
I won't be wronged,
I won't be insulted,

1021
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,080
I won't be laid
a hand on.

1022
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:07,649
I don't do these things
to other people,

1023
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,486
And I require
the same from them.

1024
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:12,921
But how could you get
into so many fights

1025
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:14,923
And always come out
on top?

1026
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:16,492
I nearly tied you
shooting.

1027
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:19,862
There's nobody up there
shooting back at you.

1028
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:21,830
It isn't always
being fast

1029
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,066
Or even accurate
that counts.

1030
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:25,701
It's being willing.

1031
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:29,171
I found out early
that most men,

1032
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,206
Regardless of cause
or need,

1033
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,007
Aren't willing.

1034
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,143
They blink an eye
or draw a breath

1035
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,179
Before they pull
the trigger.

1036
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,413
I won't.

1037
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:39,982
Bat masterson told cobb--

1038
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:41,817
Bat masterson?

1039
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:42,851
Yeah.

1040
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,888
He says that a man
has to have, uh...

1041
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:50,526
Guts, deliberation, and
a proficiency with firearms.

1042
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:53,362
Did he mention that
third eye you better have?

1043
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,663
Third eye?

1044
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:56,832
For that dumb-ass
amateur.

1045
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:59,501
It's usually some
six-fingered bustard

1046
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:02,037
That couldn't hit
a cow in the tit

1047
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,305
With a tin cup

1048
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:05,407
That does you in.

1049
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:06,808
But then,
bat masterson

1050
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,411
Always was
full of sheep dip.

1051
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:12,548
Whoa. I hope you're
smart enough to know

1052
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:16,051
That that who hit john
don't go with guns.

1053
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:19,087
Oh, sure. Yes, sir.

1054
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:22,257
Well, now that we got
that cleared up...

1055
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,459
As my mexican friend
said,

1056
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:27,029
"to the pure life."

1057
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,843
[knock on door]

1058
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:43,011
Johnny?

1059
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:45,213
Yes?

1060
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,716
May I come in?

1061
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:59,061
Don't--don't you
remember me?

1062
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:01,997
Serepta?

1063
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,967
Oh.

1064
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:10,405
Sera, I can't tell you
how happy I am you're here.

1065
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:13,175
I came
the minute I heard.

1066
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,721
Have I changed
so much?

1067
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,892
No, it's...Just been
a long time.

1068
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,464
It isn't true,
is it?

1069
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:37,466
God, how I loved you.

1070
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:40,302
And I loved you.

1071
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,271
Is it true?

1072
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,309
Oh, no.

1073
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,344
Aw, don't cry, sera.

1074
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:52,014
We all have our time.

1075
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:59,221
I must look a sight.

1076
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,091
For sore eyes.

1077
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,198
You still with pardee?

1078
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,436
No. He treated me
the way I did you.

1079
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:16,838
He just
up and skipped.

1080
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,809
We should have married.

1081
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:23,311
Spilt milk.

1082
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:25,647
You never did, huh?

1083
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:27,182
No.

1084
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:31,219
Now you're alone.
I'm so glad I'm here.

1085
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,021
So am I.

1086
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,460
Would you still
like to?

1087
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:44,700
We could get a minister
and just say I do.

1088
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:47,335
That way, I'd have
the certificate.

1089
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:49,771
I'd have something
to go on.

1090
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:50,772
Not much.

1091
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:52,340
I'd have your name.

1092
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:54,776
How far would that
take you?

1093
01:01:54,778 --> 01:01:57,746
Long ways, maybe.

1094
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,148
How?

1095
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:04,720
Johnny, you're too
modest, you know?

1096
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:07,389
Everybody knows
who you are.

1097
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,825
I'd be
mrs. J.B. Books.

1098
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:11,493
I'd be somebody.

1099
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:14,730
That wouldn't buy you
any bacon.

1100
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,999
Well, it might.

1101
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:22,003
See, that's how come
I knew that you had...

1102
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,208
That--that you was
ailing bad.

1103
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:29,511
This newspaper reporter
here tracked me down.

1104
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:31,913
He wants to put out
a book on you.

1105
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:35,283
He'll write it
and use my name.

1106
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:36,451
<i>The shootist--</i>

1107
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:39,020
<i>The life and bloody</i>
<i>times of j.B. Books</i>

1108
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:41,823
By serepta books,
his wife.

1109
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:43,225
He said
in the east

1110
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:45,427
That it would sell
like hot cakes

1111
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:47,963
And he'd split it
with me.

1112
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,332
And his name is dobkins.

1113
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,933
Right. How did you know?

1114
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:56,138
I kicked him out of here
for the same reason.

1115
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,274
Johnny,
what harm is there

1116
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,010
In a marriage certificate,
a piece of paper?

1117
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:04,713
I don't object to that.
It's the book.

1118
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:05,914
Why?

1119
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:07,516
What does he know
about my life?

1120
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:09,050
What do you know?

1121
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:13,622
He says what he doesn't
know, he'll make up,

1122
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:15,690
And, you know,
gory things,

1123
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:17,759
Shoot-'em-ups
and midnight rides

1124
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:19,761
And women tearing
out their hair.

1125
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:22,297
It will be a corker,
I promise you.

1126
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,100
Woman, I still have
<i>some</i> pride.

1127
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:30,238
A man should be allowed
his human dignity.

1128
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:40,515
I spent $3.00
on the train here.

1129
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:42,317
One-way.

1130
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:50,792
You and dobkins are two sides
of a counterfeit coin.

1131
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,961
I'll pay you back.

1132
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:55,931
I'll pay you both ways.

1133
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,401
What's wrong
about a book?

1134
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:02,938
I'll not be remembered
for a pack of lies.

1135
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,775
'cause you're too damn
mule mean, that's why.

1136
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:08,343
You always was.

01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,513
Why should you care what's
happening? You're dying.

1138
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:13,381
I have
to go on living,

1139
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,384
And you don't give a hoot
in hell what happens!

1140
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:19,554
Why should you?
You won't be here!

1141
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:22,224
God. And I loved you once.

1142
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,527
You bastard.

1143
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,363
May you rot to death!

1159
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:25,954
I should be.
I'm full of laudanum.

1160
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:27,555
I'll get
your breakfast.

1161
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:28,957
Good. Thank you.

1162
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:32,494
I didn't mean
to break up the recital.

1163
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:33,929
Oh, that's all right.

1164
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:35,297
It was just something

1165
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:36,898
For the Sunday school
class

1166
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,233
For the church social.

1167
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:42,037
Bond, uh, I've driven off
all your other lodgers.

1168
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:45,774
Is it all right if I
have breakfast out here?

1169
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:47,542
Of course it is.

1170
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:53,848
I was delighted to see you
had a lady caller yesterday.

1171
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,885
She asked me
not to announce her.

1172
01:05:56,887 --> 01:06:00,789
She said she wanted
to surprise you.

1173
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,624
Were you surprised?

1174
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,726
That I was.

1175
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:06,428
Oh, these clothes,
uh...

1176
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:09,030
They're my
Sunday-go-to-meetings.

1177
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:11,666
I wish you'd give them
a good brushing.

1178
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:13,034
Certainly.

1179
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,805
They're getting
pretty roady.

1180
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:19,841
Nine days on the back
of a saddle

1181
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:21,209
In a bedroll.

1182
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:23,712
Wouldn't you rather
have them cleaned?

1183
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:25,680
That's the general idea.

1184
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:27,716
I mean there's
a new method

1185
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:29,150
Called dry-process
cleaning.

1186
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,785
It's very good.

1187
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:32,187
How long does it take?

1188
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:33,788
They advertise
next-day service,

1189
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,156
But tomorrow's
Sunday.

1190
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,559
I'm afraid I'll have
to settle for the brushing

1191
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:40,128
'cause I'll need them
first thing Monday morning.

1192
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,731
I'll ask. If I can't
get them by then,

1193
01:06:42,733 --> 01:06:44,099
I'll brush them.

1194
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:46,735
I'll get
your ham and eggs.

1195
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:48,870
Just biscuits will do.

1196
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:51,406
My stomach's
kind of feeble today.

1197
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:54,075
Oh. You sure

1198
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:56,077
You won't want these
for church tomorrow?

1199
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,214
I don't think so.

1200
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:02,851
You're most welcome to
accompany gillom and me.

1201
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:04,853
Maybe your church
won't welcome me.

1202
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:07,122
That's a terrible thing
to say.

1203
01:07:07,124 --> 01:07:10,125
Doors of the church
are open to everyone.

1204
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:13,661
Well, my church has been
the mountains and solitude.

1205
01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:15,030
No doors at all.

1206
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:18,400
That's hardly
the same thing.

1207
01:07:18,402 --> 01:07:21,069
We all need a minister
to guide us.

1208
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:23,304
Well, if you think of it,

1209
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:25,907
Give a thought
to my soul tomorrow.

1210
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:28,343
I will. I have been
praying for you.

1211
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:30,378
I think gillom has, too.

1212
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,048
Thank you.
Thank you both.

1213
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,250
Tell me, um...

1214
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:38,820
What did he do yesterday
that made you so angry?

1215
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:40,755
It isn't what he did.

1216
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:42,390
It's what he didn't do.

1217
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,992
We have that
straightened out.

1218
01:07:43,994 --> 01:07:46,394
You should be proud
of gillom.

1219
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,997
He has the making
of something special.

1220
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:50,398
I hope so.

1221
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,801
I'm going to send
reverend saunders

1222
01:07:52,803 --> 01:07:53,802
To see you tomorrow.

1223
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:55,837
No, thank you.

1224
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,440
Maybe it'll make it
easier for you.

1225
01:07:58,442 --> 01:07:59,274
No.

1226
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:01,376
Just for a few minutes.

1227
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:03,978
Bond, I'm tired of people
pawing over my death

1228
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,748
For this reason or that
or for any reason.

1229
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,651
A man's death is about
the most private thing

1230
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:11,052
In his life.

1231
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:13,822
It doesn't belong to dobkins
or reverend saunders

1232
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:15,390
Or thibido or you.

1233
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:16,324
It's mine.

1234
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:18,960
I suppose that's true
of your soul, too.

1235
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:21,329
My soul is what
I've already made of it.

1236
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:24,365
You reprimand me
for making judgments

1237
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,801
With a gun barrel
poked in my face,

1238
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:30,672
But it's all right for you
to judge me on hearsay.

1239
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:33,942
Maybe I'm better than
you've already decided.

1240
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:38,146
Maybe I'm no worse than that
good reverend you brag about.

1241
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:40,148
Maybe you just like
being a gunman.

1242
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,183
I suppose you prefer
the word shootist.

1243
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:45,053
I don't think
of myself as either.

1244
01:08:45,055 --> 01:08:47,055
Oh, no. You're some
godlike creature

1245
01:08:47,057 --> 01:08:48,623
Of infinite knowledge,
aren't you?

1246
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:53,194
I'm a dying man
scared of the dark.

1247
01:08:53,196 --> 01:08:56,831
Damn you! Damn you for
the pain you've brought

1248
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,700
Into this house.

1249
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,838
There we are, sir.

1250
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,279
Mr. Books.

1251
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:19,480
Yes, sir?

1252
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:22,116
I'm hezekiah beckum,
the undertaker, sir.

1253
01:10:22,118 --> 01:10:23,484
How do you do?

1254
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:26,854
I hope you don't think
my stopping by

1255
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:28,156
Is untimely, sir.

1256
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:32,260
No, I admire a man
with get-up-and-go.

1257
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:35,263
As the saying goes
in our profession,

1258
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:39,567
The early worm
gets the bird.

1259
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:43,571
I, uh, admit to having heard
some unfortunate things.

1260
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,574
I'd like to express
my heartfelt regret.

1261
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,743
All right.
What's your proposition?

1262
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,312
I'm prepared to offer
you embalming

1263
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:54,148
By the most, uh,
scientific methods,

1264
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:57,385
A bronze coffin guaranteed
good for a century

1265
01:10:57,387 --> 01:10:58,987
Regardless
of the climatic

1266
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:01,022
Or geological
conditions,

1267
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,390
My best hearse,

1268
01:11:02,392 --> 01:11:04,792
Uh, the minister
of your choice,

1269
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:08,630
And the presence of at
least, uh, two mourners...

1270
01:11:08,632 --> 01:11:12,100
A headstone of the finest
carrara marble...

1271
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,535
And a plot in size
and location

1272
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:16,237
Befitting
your status, sir...

1273
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,840
And perpetual care
of the grounds.

1274
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:20,608
For how much?

1275
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,478
Why, nothing, sir.
For the privilege.

1276
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,348
No, I mean how much will
you make on the deal?

1277
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,784
Oh, beckum,
you're going to do to me

1278
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,387
What they did
to john wesley hardin.

1279
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:34,422
You're going
to lay me out,

1280
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:37,959
Let the public gawp at me
for 50 cents a head,

1281
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,961
10 cents
for the children.

1282
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,362
When the curiosity
peters out,

1283
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:43,298
You'll stick me
in a hole

1284
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,933
While you hurry to
the bank with your loot.

1285
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:47,568
I assure you--

1286
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:50,171
Give me a scrap
of paper and a pencil.

1287
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:52,040
What good's
your assurance

1288
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:55,476
When my veins are filled
with your damn juice?

1289
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:58,846
No. Here's what
you're going to do.

1290
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:02,950
First you're going
to give me $50 cash.

1291
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:04,352
Then early
Monday morning,

1292
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:06,587
You'll bring me

1293
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:10,258
I want a small headstone
with this written on it.

1294

Nothing else.

No jabbery, no angels.
You got that?

1296
01:12:14,097 --> 01:12:17,098
Mr. Books,
you're a hard man.

1297
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,733
I'm alive.

1298
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:21,135
Ah, very well.

1299
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:23,137
I'll set
my stonecutter

1300
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,773
To work on the inscription
immediately.

Mr. Beckum.

1302

The $50.

01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,879
Oh. Hmm.

1304
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,122
Thank you, sir.

That beckum is just
what you say he is.

1307
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:58,106
Well...Now,
how much do I owe you?

1308
01:12:58,108 --> 01:12:59,941
Not one bitty penny,
mr. Books.

1309
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,510
Why, to watch that
performance you done give,

1310
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:05,513
I'd have paid $10
in a theater.

1311
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:09,384
Well, I may just accept
your generosity.

Besides, I may
just see if beckum

Would like to buy some of
j.B. Books' hair.

With
your permission.

Mike sweeney.
Do you know him?

1322
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:57,398
Sure, I do. He's got one of
those horseless carriages.

1323
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,368
And now for the favor
I'm going to ask you.

1324
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:02,770
You just tell me, sir.
Anything at all.

1325

Don't dive in till
you know how deep it is.

Today's the 27th,

01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:09,811
Yes, sir.

Now, that's jack pulford,
jay cobb, and mike sweeney.

Tomorrow morning early,

I want you to go to each one
of them and tell them

01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:21,456
That I'll be at the
metropole

1332
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:24,225
At 11 a.M.
On Monday the 29th,

1333
01:14:24,227 --> 01:14:29,030
And don't tell any of them
that you've told the others.

1334
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:30,898
Cobb's still in jail.

1335
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,900
Yeah, well,
tell him anyway.

1336
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:36,103
Think you can
do that for me?

1337
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:37,839
Well, I know I can,

1338
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:40,808
But, uh, ma's going
to have conniptions

1339
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:44,412
If I don't go to
church in the morning.

You can go
to church first.

I telephoned moses.

01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:15,609
Of having him try his
luck at my faro table."

1453
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:18,445
We'll have
to give it a try.

1454
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:23,584
Now, how about
the other fella--sweeney?

1455
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,922
You watch out
for him, mr. Books.

1456
01:20:27,924 --> 01:20:30,858
That man is mean,
and he hates you.

1457
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:34,495
Well, we'll see if we can't
clear that up tomorrow.

1458
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:36,263
Sir, what's--

1459
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:39,400
Thank you. We both
ought to get some sleep.

1460
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,001
Can I ask you something?

1461
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,571
No, I'm tuckered out.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1462
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:47,041
But I have to be out
before sunup,

1463
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:49,777
Do the milk deliveries
while cobb's in jail.

1464
01:20:49,779 --> 01:20:52,546
Then we'll both
have a busy morning.

1465
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,285
Before you go...

1466
01:20:58,287 --> 01:21:01,288
There's something
I want to give you.

1467
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,558
No, sir. No.
I won't take pay.

1468
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,293
And I wouldn't offer it,
gillom.

1469
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:08,996
But you like old dollar,
don't you?

1470
01:21:08,998 --> 01:21:11,365
Best horse I ever rode.

1471
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,535
Well, he's yours.
I bought him back.

1472
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:15,870
Here's the bill of sale.

1473
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:18,405
Now let me get
some sleep.

1474
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:27,915
Sir?

1475
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:29,984
Yeah?

1476
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:32,786
When you asked me
to do this,

1477
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:35,856
I--I didn't realize...

1478
01:21:35,858 --> 01:21:38,158
And--and I just hope
that nothing--

1479
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,528
Just take good care
of old dollar.

1480
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,535
Good night, sir.

1481
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:15,229
[knock on door]

1482
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,465
[knock knock]

1483
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:20,301
Come in.

1484
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:22,903
We got the headstone.
Mr. Beckum--

1485
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:25,873
Good. Just put it there
on the bed.

1486
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:29,310
Beckum said as how he done
the best he could,

1487
01:22:29,312 --> 01:22:31,378
But there weren't
much time.

1488
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,514
Yeah, well, that'll
be all right.

1489
01:22:33,516 --> 01:22:34,915
Well, I'll be goldarned,

1490
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:37,952
If they ain't gone
and left the date off.

1491
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,520
That'll be all right.

1492
01:22:39,522 --> 01:22:40,487
Yes, sir.

1493
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:41,689
Thank you.

1494
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:00,407
[knocking on window]

1495
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,361
Early for you,
ain't it?

1496
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:23,230
Yeah, well,
I'm expecting somebody.

1497
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:28,869
Bring me a cup of coffee,
will you, murray?

1498
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:30,270
Sure.

1499
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,349
John bernard?

1500
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,452
Oh.

1501
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,157
How grand you look.

1502
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:59,460
Thank you, bond.

1503
01:24:59,462 --> 01:25:03,464
That dry-process cleaning
is very good, isn't it?

1504
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:06,100
Yeah, but it's kind
of smelly.

1505
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:07,634
Well, that's the naphtha.

1506
01:25:07,636 --> 01:25:09,236
Oh, this is my birthday.

1507
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:14,208
I, uh, haven't been to
a saloon for a long time,

1508
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:17,144
And I thought I'd get
a drink and celebrate.

1509
01:25:17,146 --> 01:25:19,546
Happy birthday.

1510
01:25:19,548 --> 01:25:22,149
Thank you.

1511
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:27,187
You have
a beautiful day for it.

1512
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:29,756
It's what we call
false spring.

1513
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,900
Goodbye, mrs. Rogers.

1514
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:43,403
Goodbye, mr. Books.

1515
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,299
Well, boy,
here's your big chance.

1516
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:13,834
Fame and fortune awaits.

1517
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:17,404
After I put that old man
out of his misery,

1518
01:26:17,406 --> 01:26:19,139
I'm going to get you.

1519
01:26:19,141 --> 01:26:20,874
Sure, you will.

1520
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:25,345
Don't wet your pants.

1521
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:29,783
Marshal thibido!
May I see you for a moment?

1522
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:36,657
What's going on?

1523
01:26:36,659 --> 01:26:38,859
Shh! Dobkins,
this is law business,

1524
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:40,761
Not newspaper business.

1525
01:26:40,763 --> 01:26:44,364
Adolph s. Ochs is the publisher
of    <i>the new york times.</i>

1526
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:46,366
Mr ochs has asked me
for an article

1527
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,368
On how city officials
are reacting

1528
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:50,804
To the presence
of our famous shootist.

1529
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:54,808
I was thinking of doing
a series of stories on you.

1530
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:57,377
Whooee. Let's get
the hell off the street.

1531
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:00,914
You tell them that's
thibido with an "h."

1532
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:04,851
Good morning.

1533
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:06,653
Good morning,
mr. Books.

1534
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:21,001
You don't give a fella
very long to board this thing.

1535
01:27:21,003 --> 01:27:23,737
Got a schedule to keep.

1536
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,106
Good morning.

1537
01:27:26,108 --> 01:27:27,474
Good morning, sir.

1538
01:27:27,476 --> 01:27:30,310
Isn't it
a beautiful day?

1539
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,380
It sure is.

1540
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:38,352
It's what we call
a false spring.

1541
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:38,345
Yes, sir?

1542
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:44,785
Glass.

1543
01:28:44,787 --> 01:28:46,186
[crash]

1544
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:48,055
Mr. Sweeney...

1545
01:28:48,057 --> 01:28:50,324
Care to try your luck?

1546
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,527
Hmm.

1547
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:27,361
Hmm.

1548
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,404
Whoa!

1549
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:14,775
Friend...For you.

1550
01:30:14,777 --> 01:30:15,776
What?

1551
01:30:15,778 --> 01:30:18,678
Make you a little
more comfortable.

1552
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,083
Well, sir, these old bones
surely thank you.

1553
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:29,456
I sure hope the right
fella comes along.

1554
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,826
Good morning, sir.

1555
01:31:05,828 --> 01:31:06,660
Good morning.

1556
01:31:06,662 --> 01:31:09,229
This is my birthday.

1557
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:12,265
Give me the best
in the house.

1558
01:31:12,267 --> 01:31:13,600
Yes, sir.

1559
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,911
Thank you, sir.

1560
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:54,734
And I'll tell you
that was for albert!

1561
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,215
Look out!
