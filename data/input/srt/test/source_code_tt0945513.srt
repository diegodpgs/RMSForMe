1
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,801
Dark Star November,
this is Gator 6. Return to base.

2
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,403
Dark Star November, this is Gator 6.
Return to base.

3
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,859
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.

4
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,260
You look pale. Everything okay?

5
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,970
Sean?

6
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,230
Sean?

7
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,803
Hey.

8
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,406
Anyway, listen. I wanted to tell you.

9
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,312
- God damn it!
- The only reason why I canceled...

10
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,882
He's calling me three times a day.

11
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,148
I hear more from him now than I did
when we were together.

12
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,414
What is it with guys?

13
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,295
I gave notice.

14
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,890
- Ticket?
- Notice?

15
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,332
May I see your ticket?

16
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,560
I, uh...

17
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,774
Hey. Hey.

18
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,315
You're acting a little strange this morning.
You okay?

19
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,319
- Ticket?
- Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?

20
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,443
We're gonna try, sir.

21
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,355
Hey, Grandpa,
what the heck was the delay back there?

22
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,451
I just punch the tickets, sir.

23
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,524
I should punch your face.

24
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,855
Sean? Did I do something?

25
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,957
Look, I can see that you think you know me,
but I don't know who you are.

26
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,504
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.

27
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,200
I fly helicopters for the U.S. Army
in Afghanistan.

28
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,876
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

29
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,413
Sean, that's...

30
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,311
- Sean?
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.

31
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,544
I feel sick.

32
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,221
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry.

33
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,822
- Let me help you with that.
- No, it's okay.

34
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,588
Glenbrook Station.

35
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,466
Hey, mister!

36
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,771
- Hey!
- Glenbrook Station.

37
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:32,964
Hey!

38
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,631
You dropped this.

39
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,902
Thanks.

40
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,011
What is that?

41
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,113
Chicago.

42
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,590
All aboard.

43
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,120
Doors are closing.

44
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,368
This is a Chicago-bound train.

45
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,804
You okay there, Captain?

46
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,909
Next stop, Chicago.

47
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,654
Union Station.

48
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,019
Did you see that?

49
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,226
You're kind of freaking me out.

50
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,074
No.

51
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,676
No, no, no, no.

52
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,004
Are you all right?

53
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,172
I don't know what's going on.

54
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,336
Talk to me, Sean.

55
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,883
Look, I don't know who Sean is.
And I don't know who you are.

56
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,517
Okay. We'll get off at the next stop.

57
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,418
We'll figure out
whatever's going on here, okay?

58
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,554
This doesn't belong to me.

59
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,325
Look at me. Everything's gonna be okay.

60
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,851
Captain
Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.

61
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,182
Captain Colter Stevens,
this is Beleaguered Castle.

62
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,852
Acknowledge transmission.

63
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,999
Captain Stevens, do you copy?

64
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,536
Where am I?

65
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,233
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Are you functional?

66
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,980
I'm dizzy. Did I just A-lock?

67
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,241
Adjusting your rotation.

68
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,988
Can you report at this time?

69
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,385
What is this? What is this?

70
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,052
Where...

71
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,062
Who am I talking to?

72
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,688
Captain, report what you saw.

73
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,691
What? I don't understand.

74
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,565
Where were you
before you were talking to me?

75
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,672
There was an explosion.

76
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,867
Coming from where?

77
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:02,375
Some confusion is perfectly normal
at this stage, Captain.

78
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,908
Do you have a visual signal?

79
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,448
Who are you?

80
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,293
You already have that information, Captain.

81
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,297
- I do?
- Recall my name.

82
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,339
We'll rebuild the pattern. Try to focus.

83
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,447
I...

84
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,040
I was on a mission.

85
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,051
I was flying,

86
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,552
and then I woke up on a train.

87
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,622
And now I'm here.

88
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,721
I need to be briefed.

89
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,954
What unit is this?

90
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,427
You're with Beleaguered Castle.

91
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,721
Who?

92
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,959
Stand by for thread one
of alpha memory pattern.

93
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,865
What is Beleaguered Castle?

94
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,761
The exercises will assist you.

95
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,797
Memory thread one.

96
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,803
Listen to the following passage.

97
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,936
"Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and opera cloak.

98
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,176
"In her hand were five playing cards."

99
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,479
- Is this a joke?
- "They were,

100
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,486
"the queen of spades, four of clubs,

101
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,451
"nine of clubs,

102
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,752
"three of hearts, nine of hearts."

103
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,424
- Is this a Red Flag exercise?
- End of thread one.

104
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,357
Thread two. The following is a recording
of a Western Screech Owl.

105
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,397
End of thread two.
End of pattern. Acknowledge.

106
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,633
Acknowledge end of pattern.

107
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,676
Stand by to initiate pattern recall.

108
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,041
Go for pattern recall.

109
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,636
Arrange the five playing cards

110
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,615
in order of descending value,
irrespective of suit.

111
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,816
- Queen, two nines, four and a three.
- That is correct.

112
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,514
The passage I read contained mention
of a woman's name.

113
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,646
What was that name?

114
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,554
- Her name was Lilly.
- That is correct.

115
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,315
Recall my name.

116
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,694
Goodwin. Your name's Goodwin.

117
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,961
That is correct. Welcome back, Captain.

118
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,015
Ma'am, I need to talk to my father.

119
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,317
Has anybody been notified
that I'm stateside?

120
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,718
Who bombed the train, Captain?

121
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,615
What?

122
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,713
Who bombed the train?

123
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,416
A woman kept calling me Sean.

124
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,620
That is incidental.

125
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,228
Think, Captain. Remember back.

126
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,057
Who bombed the train?

127
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,191
I don't know who bombed
the goddamn train.

128
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,068
- Then go back and try again.
- Back where?

129
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,532
You will have eight minutes,
same as last time.

130
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,838
No, no, no, no.
No more bullshit sim tests, okay?

131
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,275
I need to know where I am.

132
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,438
What is the location
and condition of my crew?

133
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,674
Does anybody know that I'm stateside?

134
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,883
You are obligated
to give me this information.

135
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,078
Start with the bomb.

136
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,552
Where is it? What does it look like?

137
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,551
What kind of explosive?
How is it detonated?

138
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,315
- Right.
- Find the bomb,

139
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,416
and you will find the bomber.

140
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,791
Find the bomb. Wait, no, I...

141
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,113
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.

142
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,775
Okay. That's good.

143
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,079
And I signed up for an LSAT course.

144
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,252
Next thing you know,
I'll be moving to India to find myself.

145
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,345
LSAT.

146
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,221
Know any good gurus?

147
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,323
She got your shoe.

148
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,493
So, what do you think?
Am I on the right track?

149
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,763
It's the same train, but it's different.

150
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,799
Deep.

151
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,569
I hope it's different. I feel the same way.

152
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,140
What?

153
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,479
- Do I have...
- Bryan.

154
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,418
What is it with guys?
Everything's more beautiful in retrospect.

155
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,950
What is...

156
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,821
This looks so real.

157
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:11,296
I think it's gonna be really good for me
to get as far away from him as possible.

158
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,558
Unbelievable detail.

159
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,157
Ticket? May I see your ticket?

160
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:50,136
They wouldn't put the doer in front of me.

161
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:52,438
- The doer?
- You're the pretty girl.

162
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:54,278
- Ticket?
- The distraction.

163
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,179
- Distraction?
- Every sim has one.

164
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:57,514
Are we gonna make up the 10 minutes?

165
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,713
- We are gonna try, sir.
- Are you talking about Bryan?

166
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:02,656
Hey, Grandpa,
what the hell was the delay back there?

167
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:05,617
- What are you late for?
- What?

168
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:08,892
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?

169
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:11,934
I'm on my way to an asshole festival.
I hear you're headlining.

170
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,026
That's funny. What are you, a comedian?

171
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:15,195
Yeah.

172
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:16,701
He is a comedian.

173
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:19,436
Sit down.

174
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:20,831
Freak.

175
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:22,974
Fans.

176
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,281
That's the guy.

177
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,977
He came in third on America's Got Talent.
Got cited twice for a DUI.

178
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:33,148
We talked about him.

179
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:35,247
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

180
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:38,020
Glenbrook Station.

181
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:40,391
Yeah, but by 1:00
the bridge is gonna be jammed.

182
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:42,723
Damn it!

183
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:44,163
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,361
Just let me get it, okay?

185
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:54,303
Hey, mister!

186
00:13:54,377 --> 00:13:55,742
Hey!

187
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:58,905
Hey! You dropped this.

188
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:02,044
Thanks.

189
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,299
All aboard.

190
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,794
Doors are closing.

191
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:38,179
This is a Chicago-bound train.

192
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:41,485
The explosion came from behind me.

193
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:48,553
- What's with you?
- I don't have time to talk to you right now.

194
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:49,996
I got time for you.

195
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:51,931
Next stop, Chicago.

196
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,802
Union Station.

197
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,673
Holy shit.

198
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:53,928
Goodwin?

199
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,760
You gonna tell me how to disarm this?

200
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:00,560
Uh...

201
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:03,803
Should I...

202
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:06,933
Unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it? Or...

203
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:12,043
Okay, um...

204
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:16,910
I'm just gonna leave it.

205
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:20,646
Okay?

206
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:30,687
I'll be late.

207
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,706
Ladies and gentlemen, transit security.

208
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:50,376
- No, you're not.
- Due to a classified security breach,

209
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:52,818
I need all of you to turn off
any personal electronic devices

210
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,219
until we pull into the station, okay?

211
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,653
That means laptops, cell phones.
Cell phone, sir? Cell phone, sir.

212
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,956
Thank you very much.
Pagers, anything electronic.

213
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,497
Thank you. It's just a precautionary
measure. Nothing to worry about.

214
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:05,064
So which is it?
Security breach or precautionary measure?

215
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:06,863
Sir? Sir.

216
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:10,297
Is there a problem here, sir?

217
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,806
- I'm in the middle of a very big deal.
- Sean?

218
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,343
- I need you to turn that off.
- Why don't you show me that ID again?

219
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:16,400
- Sean?
- Turn it off.

220
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:18,507
- Turn it off.
- What's your problem, asshole?

221
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:20,637
Hey!

222
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,845
Sean! What are you doing?

223
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,050
Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
Not a good idea.

224
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:26,913
That's not a good idea.

225
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:28,547
- I think you broke his jaw.
- It's okay.

226
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:29,784
He's not any more real than you are.

227
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:32,258
I'm not real?
How about next time you drive to work?

228
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,522
Not gonna be a next time.

229
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:53,273
Stabilize.

230
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:59,486
Lower your pulse.

231
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,749
Did you find the bomb?

232
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,319
Yes.

233
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:13,699
There's hydraulic fluid all over the floor.

234
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,668
It's not a concern, Captain.

235
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:18,502
- What is...
- Tell me about the bomb.

236
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,012
Where's that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.

237
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:27,515
He looks like he's in charge.
I want to talk to him.

238
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,743
That's irrelevant, Captain.

239
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,614
I want to talk to your commanding officer!

240
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,914
You can talk to him upon completion
of your mission.

241
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,958
My mission is in Afghanistan,
where my unit is.

242
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:39,290
I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday!

243
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:43,458
You've been with us for two months.

244
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,068
Did you ID the bomber?

245
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:51,171
No. Where's my unit?

246
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:56,002
And under whose jurisdiction
is this simulation?

247
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:59,377
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.

248
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,171
What lives?

249
00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:04,682
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.

250
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:08,084
No, no, no. What lives?
What are you talking about?

251
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,590
I need to be briefed.

252
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,768
Sir, I need to give him something.

253
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:23,161
That's fine. Go ahead.

254
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:24,432
Okay.

255
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:27,104
Get ready to send him back in.

256
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:32,611
We're still waiting. Justin is trying to do
all the profiles right now.

257
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:36,478
At 7:48 this morning,
Central Standard Time,

258
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,248
a bomb exploded on a commuter train
outside of Chicago,

259
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:41,789
killing everyone on board.

260
00:19:41,857 --> 00:19:43,757
And that's the train that you've been on.

261
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:46,920
No, no, no. I'm right here.
You're talking to me right now.

262
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,562
A man named Sean Fentress
was on that train.

263
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:55,194
He, for all intents and purposes, is now you.

264
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:59,000
Every second spent explaining things

265
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,042
puts more innocent civilians at risk.

266
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:04,137
- This makes no sense.
- The train explosion

267
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:07,239
was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.

268
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:09,809
Now, did you find the bomb?

269
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,188
In the restroom.

270
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,723
Ventilation panel above the sink.

271
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,658
Cell phone detonator.

272
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:22,555
Are we done?

273
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:26,061
No, no. But that's good.
That's very, very good, Captain.

274
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:27,600
Good.

275
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:33,302
Our records show that 1,812 calls ended
at the moment of the explosion.

276
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,833
Fifty-two of those calls were tethered
to the cell tower nearest the train.

277
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:39,210
So, one of those calls was made
by our bomber.

278
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:42,978
Do you remember a freight train passing by
just before the explosion?

279
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:44,712
- Yes.
- The explosion was timed

280
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:46,186
to engulf the passing freight train,

281
00:20:46,255 --> 00:20:50,248
which means the bomber had to be watching
both trains when the call was made.

282
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:53,153
Fifty-two callers.

283
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:54,718
One of those is our bomber.

284
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:58,563
I want you to concentrate on the passengers
in your car. Get to know them.

285
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:02,696
Narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem

286
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:05,331
quiet or withdrawn.

287
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,069
Who seem nervous.

288
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,770
As always, you will have eight minutes.

289
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:12,010
Eight minutes and then I blow up again?

290
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,540
Yes.

291
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:20,881
I need you to discipline yourself
on this next pass.

292
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:23,049
Perform only the tasks that we assign you.

293
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,490
Everything else is irrelevant.

294
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:26,652
Charge the drivers.

295
00:21:26,728 --> 00:21:28,855
Okay. Has my father even...

296
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:39,769
I took your advice.

297
00:21:42,244 --> 00:21:43,734
It was very good advice.

298
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:46,607
Watch it.

299
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,274
You're kind of quiet today.

300
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,840
Just got a lot on my mind.

301
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:50,907
Careful.

302
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:52,280
Yikes.

303
00:21:52,387 --> 00:21:54,912
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

304
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,084
Ticket?

305
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:00,150
That was very kind of you.

306
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,599
You're very decent.

307
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:13,138
Thank you.

308
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:16,811
You're real.

309
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:18,240
Ticket?

310
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:21,674
- How's everything today?
- It's good.

311
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,218
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- No.

312
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,846
I meant behavior on the train.

313
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:30,551
Does anything, anybody
seem strange to you?

314
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,252
You're a little strange.

315
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:38,592
How about you?
Does anybody look suspicious?

316
00:22:39,468 --> 00:22:40,765
Are you drunk or something?

317
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:42,465
Come here.

318
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:45,501
Come here for a second.

319
00:22:47,543 --> 00:22:48,532
Come on.

320
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:58,313
Think of it as a game.

321
00:22:58,387 --> 00:22:59,581
A game?

322
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,514
Wow.

323
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:07,059
They're all so utterly normal, Sean.

324
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:09,029
That's what's so terrifying about them.

325
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:12,562
Maybe there's a team at work.

326
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:17,929
The sleeping giant in cahoots
with the minister and Denoff there.

327
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:21,107
Don't forget the sullen college kid.
He's the expendable one.

328
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:23,667
I bet they're all controlled by the conductor.

329
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:29,611
Standing there all dictatorial.
Demanding tickets.

330
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,050
You're funny.

331
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:32,713
Damn it.

332
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,983
What about that guy?

333
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:36,518
Deposition.

334
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:38,651
What about the woman
who's sitting across from him?

335
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:40,820
Hair appointment. Every Monday.
You know this.

336
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:42,386
You talk to these people more than I do.

337
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,364
Right, right. And the guy behind her,

338
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:46,833
he's late for an audition, right?

339
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:49,996
That or a court appearance.

340
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:52,233
- That's the guy that was cited twice for DUI.
- For DUI. I know.

341
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,207
- Hey, how's the signal in here?
- It's good.

342
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:57,137
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

343
00:23:57,212 --> 00:23:59,772
Is teaching not stimulating enough for you
anymore, Sherlock?

344
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,644
Uh-oh.

345
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,985
Now we've slipped into racial profiling land.

346
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:10,388
Did anyone else come out
of that bathroom today?

347
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,424
Well,
I saw you coming out of there.

348
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:13,788
- Me?
- Yes.

349
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:16,831
- No.
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.

350
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:18,024
Me?

351
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,727
Hey, mister!

352
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:20,961
- Hey.
- Hold on.

353
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:22,936
Hold on a second. Just hold on a second.

354
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,336
There's gotta be something in here.

355
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:27,000
- You dropped this.
- Gotta be something in here.

356
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:30,574
A broken phone? What is this?

357
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:33,279
Glenbrook Station.

358
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:37,410
Christina?

359
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:39,113
Yeah.

360
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:40,948
Excuse me.

361
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,784
Glenbrook Station.

362
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:48,528
Hey. Hey, come with me.

363
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:50,428
- This isn't our stop.
- No, come on. Let's take a walk.

364
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:52,467
- We don't get off here.
- I know. We'll just be spontaneous.

365
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,592
You're kind of freaking me out.

366
00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:03,206
I know this is gonna sound really weird,

367
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:05,178
but I have a really bad feeling
about this train,

368
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:07,647
and I think that we should get off. Okay?

369
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,948
- Just get your stuff.
- All aboard. Doors are closing.

370
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:22,125
Come on. Come with me.

371
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,693
So, what now?

372
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:28,429
Wait for me, right here. I'll be right back.

373
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,240
Your attention, please.
Train 7140 to Skokie

374
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:40,042
will be leaving in 15 minutes from track two.

375
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:10,968
Your attention, please.
Train 7140 to Skokie will be leaving in...

376
00:27:22,193 --> 00:27:23,285
Hey.

377
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:27,058
You ready to get that coffee now?

378
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:31,662
Sorry, yeah. Just one more second, okay?

379
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,544
Oh, for God's sake.

380
00:27:47,218 --> 00:27:48,207
Feeling sick?

381
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:53,023
It's motion sickness. I get it all the time.

382
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,328
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me?

383
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:28,235
- Are you following me?
- Can I borrow your phone?

384
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:31,130
No. I don't have one.

385
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:32,901
Sure?

386
00:28:32,974 --> 00:28:34,236
Yeah, I'm sure.

387
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,437
Look, why don't you leave me alone, please.
Or I'll call the police.

388
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:40,104
With what?
I thought you said you didn't have a phone.

389
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:45,579
You know, you have no right.

390
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:49,950
What are you doing? Give me my bag back!

391
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,188
Are you crazy?

392
00:28:56,998 --> 00:28:58,522
- Where are they?
- Sean?

393
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,589
Get back!

394
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:00,999
Sean, what are you doing?

395
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:04,865
Sean, what's going on?

396
00:29:08,377 --> 00:29:09,639
- Sean!
- Where is the phone?

397
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:11,837
Sean! Sean!

398
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:18,475
It wasn't you.

399
00:29:20,522 --> 00:29:21,648
What the hell's wrong with you?

400
00:29:21,723 --> 00:29:22,849
- No!
- Are you insane?

401
00:29:22,924 --> 00:29:25,154
No! No! No!

402
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:26,984
- Where is the phone?
- Stop it!

403
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:28,222
- Get away from me!
- Where is it?

404
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:29,729
Get away from me, please!

405
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:35,002
Sean. Sean! Get up! Sean?

406
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,368
- Shit.
- Sean, listen to me! Get up!

407
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,530
- Sean! Sean!
- Give me your hand! Get off the track!

408
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:43,109
- Mister, come on!
- Sean, Sean, get up!

409
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:44,970
Sean! Sean!

410
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:57,555
Cold.

411
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:05,161
Goodwin?

412
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,630
Goodwin, come in. Do you read me?

413
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,605
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Do you copy? Please respond.

414
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:24,745
It's freezing in here. What's going on?

415
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:32,718
What was that?

416
00:30:36,031 --> 00:30:37,020
He's in trouble.

417
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:40,558
I think the oxygen just went out.

418
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:46,496
Goodwin?

419
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:51,601
Goodwin!

420
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:57,711
Find a way to get through to him.

421
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:20,497
What is it?

422
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:24,304
What's going on?

423
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:31,948
It's not the tertiary cooling, either.

424
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:43,293
Just keep sending strings out.
See if he hooks onto something.

425
00:31:51,072 --> 00:31:52,801
It's hard to say exactly
what he's going through.

426
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:03,646
- Sir?
- Please!

427
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:05,844
There's not a whole lot
we can do from here.

428
00:32:13,528 --> 00:32:15,826
If nothing changes,
how much time does he have?

429
00:32:15,931 --> 00:32:18,331
Some.

430
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,958
But not a lot.

431
00:32:49,497 --> 00:32:52,091
There are four principal dialects of Arabic.

432
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:56,501
Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-Lebanese
and North African.

433
00:32:56,571 --> 00:33:00,132
We will now play you portions of each,
discussing their differences.

434
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:17,391
Lilly awoke
in an evening dress and opera cloak.

435
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:19,586
In her hand were five playing cards.

436
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:22,357
They were the queen of spades,
the four of clubs...

437
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:33,696
Goodwin, you out there?

438
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:39,910
Goodwin? Where's Goodwin?

439
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:42,744
This is Captain Stevens. Do you copy?

440
00:33:42,817 --> 00:33:45,115
Captain Stevens?

441
00:33:45,186 --> 00:33:46,653
The capsule lost power.

442
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:48,915
The capsule?

443
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,551
Is that where you are right now, Captain?
In a capsule?

444
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:54,290
You should know. Who are you?

445
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:56,592
Let me get Captain Goodwin. Get Goodwin.

446
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:58,062
You invented this thing, right?

447
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,128
- I did.
- Wait. Are you in command here?

448
00:34:01,469 --> 00:34:04,927
I am. Were you able to locate the information
we need, Captain?

449
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:07,034
That's a negative, sir.

450
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:11,374
I was unable to find the bomber,
but I did save a passenger on the train.

451
00:34:11,446 --> 00:34:12,936
I got her off safely. A woman.

452
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:16,950
Captain? It's gonna be counterproductive
for you to try to save anyone on that train.

453
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:18,246
They are outside the mission.

454
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,883
But she survived.

455
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:22,217
And maybe the rest could, too.

456
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:24,416
She survived,
but only inside the source code.

457
00:34:24,492 --> 00:34:25,516
None of them can be saved.

458
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:27,288
What is the source code?

459
00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:30,160
It's quantum mechanics. Parabolic calculus.

460
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,064
- It's very complicated.
- Try me.

461
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,330
Fine.

462
00:34:38,073 --> 00:34:40,268
When a light bulb is turned off,
there's an after-glow,

463
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:42,468
a lingering, halo-like effect.
Have you seen it?

464
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:44,668
- Yes.
- Of course.

465
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,616
The brain is like that.
Its electromagnetic field remains charged,

466
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:51,811
just briefly, even after death.
Circuits remain open.

467
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:54,951
Now, there's another peculiarity
about the brain.

468
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:56,718
It contains a short-term memory track

469
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,452
that's approximately eight minutes long.

470
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:00,957
Like a convenience store security camera

471
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:04,396
that only records the last portion
of the day's activity on its hard drive.

472
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,263
Now, in combining these two phenomena,

473
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:09,899
circuitry that remains viable post-mortem

474
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:12,462
and a memory bank
that goes back eight minutes,

475
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,873
source code enables us to capitalize
on the overlap.

476
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,841
Sean Fentress died on that train.

477
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:20,141
Of all the passengers aboard,

478
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:23,673
he was your best link.
You two share compatibility

479
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:27,586
in terms of gender, body-size,
and your synaptic maps.

480
00:35:27,689 --> 00:35:29,350
What happens after the eight minutes?

481
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:33,785
After? Nothing.
You cease to exist on the train.

482
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:38,823
You cannot exist inside the source code
beyond Fentress's eight minutes.

483
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:44,471
Source code is not time travel.

484
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:48,168
Rather, source code is time reassignment.

485
00:35:48,743 --> 00:35:52,179
It gives us access to a parallel reality.

486
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:54,579
Now, the deaths on that train were a tragedy,

487
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:56,048
but source code empowers us...

488
00:35:56,117 --> 00:35:59,314
No, but I saved one person.

489
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:01,947
That girl that's always sitting
across from me.

490
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:04,753
I pulled her off the train.

491
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:06,589
Give me her name.

492
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:11,320
Christina. I don't remember her last name.

493
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:19,197
Her name was Christina Warren.

494
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:22,404
- Yes.
- She was 28.

495
00:36:22,477 --> 00:36:24,775
- That's her.
- Born in Wilmette, Illinois.

496
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:26,006
Died this morning on the train.

497
00:36:28,149 --> 00:36:30,811
No, no. I pulled her off. She's fine.

498
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:31,909
No, she isn't.

499
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:33,415
Believe me. She is.

500
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:34,844
Believe me!

501
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:37,187
She saw me get hit by the express train.

502
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:39,156
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, no, no, wait.

503
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:43,357
Sir, we have to send him in.
A second attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.

504
00:36:43,431 --> 00:36:44,455
What second attack?

505
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:47,627
The train was just the beginning,
a letter of intent.

506
00:36:49,404 --> 00:36:51,201
What aren't you telling me here?

507
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:55,066
We have information
that downtown Chicago is the next target,

508
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:57,338
and they're planning to detonate
a dirty bomb.

509
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:59,809
Do you have any idea
how many people would die

510
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,406
if an explosion of that magnitude
were to occur in the city?

511
00:37:02,717 --> 00:37:03,877
We're evacuating as we speak.

512
00:37:04,452 --> 00:37:06,545
We have to stop it before it happens.
Do you understand?

513
00:37:06,621 --> 00:37:09,351
If you find the bomber,
his second attack,

514
00:37:09,424 --> 00:37:11,949
the real attack, we think, can be prevented.

515
00:37:12,427 --> 00:37:15,760
We have very little time left. Out here,
the clocks only move in one direction.

516
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:18,131
Charge the drivers.

517
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:21,100
On the upper deck of the next
carriage, there's a conductor's compartment.

518
00:37:21,436 --> 00:37:23,461
It's a small office containing a strongbox.

519
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:25,836
Inside is a loaded handgun.

520
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:29,104
Get to it. You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

521
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:34,005
I took your advice.

522
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,385
It was very good advice.

523
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:45,658
You're still here.

524
00:37:45,727 --> 00:37:47,786
Of course I am.

525
00:37:47,862 --> 00:37:48,851
Guess what?

526
00:37:49,063 --> 00:37:51,190
You quit your job
and you enrolled in an LSAT course.

527
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,057
Good guess.

528
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:54,258
Soda can.

529
00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:55,893
Coffee spill.

530
00:37:57,305 --> 00:37:58,772
Listen to me.

531
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:00,736
Don't answer this.

532
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:03,303
You deserve better than that guy.

533
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:06,609
Everything looks more beautiful
in retrospect, doesn't it?

534
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:08,447
- Ticket?
- How did you know that was...

535
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,311
- Are we going to make up the 10 minutes?
- We are going to try, sir.

536
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:13,013
- How well do you know me?
- Hey, Grandpa...

537
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:14,349
Not that well, apparently.

538
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:16,287
Do you know me well enough
that if I did something that looked

539
00:38:16,357 --> 00:38:18,120
a little strange
and was maybe even a little bit dangerous,

540
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:20,251
but I told you to trust me anyway,
that you could do that?

541
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:22,990
No.

542
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:26,628
Wow. That was honest.

543
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:31,335
You're beautiful. You're kind.

544
00:38:32,273 --> 00:38:33,501
And you're painfully honest.

545
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:36,433
Who are you?
And what did you do with Sean Fentress?

546
00:38:36,511 --> 00:38:37,944
It's the new me.

547
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,427
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

548
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:07,939
Glenbrook Station, next stop.

549
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:12,613
Ticket?

550
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:38,299
Glenbrook Station.

551
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,753
All right, I don't wanna hurt you.

552
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:04,359
No, I'm not gonna sit in my seat,
all right? He's bleeding.

553
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:05,831
He needs medical attention.

554
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:10,201
Is it true that you tried to steal a gun
out of the train's security box?

555
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:11,795
Careful, ma'am.

556
00:40:13,074 --> 00:40:15,474
- Damn it!
- What were you thinking?

557
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:18,272
- Can I borrow your phone?
- No! You need to go to the hospital, Sean.

558
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:21,315
- Please, please, let me borrow your phone.
- No! Why do you want my phone?

559
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:28,888
What would you do
if you only had a minute left to live?

560
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:31,951
I don't know.

561
00:40:33,895 --> 00:40:35,658
I would call my dad.

562
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:39,031
I would hear his voice,

563
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:42,896
and I'd tell him I was sorry.

564
00:40:50,978 --> 00:40:53,208
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.

565
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:56,847
Everything's gonna be okay.

566
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:13,394
Oh, yeah, the gun in the strongbox,
that was a really great idea. Thanks for that.

567
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:15,393
Did you make any progress?

568
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:17,260
Can I get access to a phone?

569
00:41:17,472 --> 00:41:19,406
I need to talk to my father.

570
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:23,470
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes. I will try.

571
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:30,441
Goodwin, how am I doing?

572
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,280
I'm just trying
to measure my performance here.

573
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:36,221
Have you ever gone back in?
Am I doing better than you did?

574
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:39,954
We are wasting valuable time here.

575
00:41:49,437 --> 00:41:51,132
No, no.

576
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:54,333
I have never been on the other side
of a source code mission.

577
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:57,343
- I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
- Why not?

578
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:58,969
CAOC-N. What is that?

579
00:41:59,046 --> 00:42:02,447
Because the specifications
are extremely narrow.

580
00:42:03,217 --> 00:42:04,616
What are they?

581
00:42:04,685 --> 00:42:07,779
Captain, you should have found a suspect
by now.

582
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:11,956
This tactical advantage,
this tremendous tool that we've given you,

583
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:14,721
don't squander it thinking. Do.

584
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:16,994
Please contact my father for me.

585
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:21,135
This will stop at some point, Captain.

586
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:24,527
As soon as you finish the mission.

587
00:42:25,706 --> 00:42:27,936
And you're doing really great.

588
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:30,066
And this will end.

589
00:42:31,546 --> 00:42:35,073
Now, whoever planted the bomb
had to have equipment of some kind.

590
00:42:35,149 --> 00:42:38,448
Some gloves, a screwdriver to get
into the overhead vent,

591
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,508
flashlight, something.

592
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:43,515
Check bags and backpacks,
briefcases, anything.

593
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:48,729
So, I took your advice.

594
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:51,087
- It was very good advice.
- Hey, Grandpa...

595
00:43:06,514 --> 00:43:10,644
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to remember something.

596
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:12,652
- What is that?
- It's a military patch.

597
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,519
Were you in the military?

598
00:43:16,123 --> 00:43:18,648
A friend of mine was.

599
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:23,390
He was in Afghanistan and he disappeared,
and no one's heard from him since.

600
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:29,202
Do you have the Internet on your phone?

601
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:30,828
No.

602
00:43:31,272 --> 00:43:34,799
It's just connected to the office
by a really long piece of string.

603
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:39,506
Do you think you can see
what you could find on this guy?

604
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,810
- Sure.
- He's just been on my mind a lot lately.

605
00:43:41,882 --> 00:43:44,544
His name is Captain Colter Stevens.
He's in the 17th Airborne.

606
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:46,443
Okay. You owe me.

607
00:43:46,787 --> 00:43:48,152
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

608
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:50,554
Why don't I get one for you now?

609
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,092
Okay. Christina?

610
00:43:53,894 --> 00:43:54,883
Um...

611
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:58,057
I've been having these dreams lately.

612
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,967
Really vivid.

613
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:03,926
And you've been in them.

614
00:44:05,006 --> 00:44:06,030
Really?

615
00:44:06,107 --> 00:44:09,702
What? Oh. No. Not like that.
Not that I wouldn't. I...

616
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:11,267
It's just...

617
00:44:33,701 --> 00:44:35,066
Um...

618
00:44:35,736 --> 00:44:38,830
I'll call you back in a minute, all right? Yeah.

619
00:44:39,473 --> 00:44:41,703
- Cramming?
- Uh, yeah.

620
00:44:42,243 --> 00:44:43,369
For what?

621
00:44:44,312 --> 00:44:48,908
Psych. And I got a big test this morning,
so I should get back to it.

622
00:44:48,983 --> 00:44:51,110
Can I borrow a pen?

623
00:44:54,522 --> 00:44:55,921
Yeah, sure.

624
00:44:58,626 --> 00:45:01,026
Whoa! Hey, that's not cool, man!

625
00:45:01,762 --> 00:45:03,855
Hey, your bag is a mess.

626
00:45:04,365 --> 00:45:05,798
What are you doing, man?

627
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:09,529
Never find what I'm looking for.
It's just like my bag. It's just like my bag.

628
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:10,900
How about you let the guy
have his bag back?

629
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:12,268
Finish your deal.

630
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,274
Stay out of this, tough guy.
It doesn't end well for you.

631
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:17,108
This guy.

632
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:19,238
Don't do that.

633
00:45:19,313 --> 00:45:21,577
Nothing. What am I doing?

634
00:45:23,984 --> 00:45:25,645
Jesus.

635
00:45:26,354 --> 00:45:27,343
Dick.

636
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:28,479
CAOC-N.

637
00:45:28,556 --> 00:45:32,424
- Can you believe that?
- Asshole.

638
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:43,498
Excuse me, ma'am?

639
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:45,038
Hey, how are you doing? Good morning.

640
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:48,132
- Do you work at Walter Reed?
- Yeah, I used to.

641
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:51,476
- I'm in the military.
- You're in the military?

642
00:45:51,545 --> 00:45:52,944
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I was wondering...

643
00:45:53,013 --> 00:45:55,208
Then what was going on down there?

644
00:45:58,853 --> 00:46:00,548
Oh, you know, uh...

645
00:46:00,621 --> 00:46:03,954
We were just having a little bit
of an argument, actually, about this patch.

646
00:46:04,024 --> 00:46:06,015
Is that what they train you to do?
Assault civilians?

647
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:09,256
No, ma'am, please. Do any of these letters,
they look familiar to you?

648
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,422
Do you know what the "N" stands for?

649
00:46:11,966 --> 00:46:14,799
It's Air Force, and the "N" stands for Nellis.

650
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:17,167
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

651
00:46:17,238 --> 00:46:19,433
Thank you. Can I borrow your phone?

652
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,432
You know what?
Actually, I can pay you for it.

653
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:25,605
I don't even need to borrow it.
I can pay you for it. I have $100.

654
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,580
- Just for a couple minutes...
- I don't want your money. Just bring it back.

655
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:30,844
All right. Thank you so much.

656
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:41,128
This is a Chicago-bound train.

657
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:43,990
Next stop, Chicago,

658
00:46:44,498 --> 00:46:46,432
Union Station.

659
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:48,763
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

660
00:46:57,111 --> 00:46:58,100
Post Operator.

661
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:03,741
- Rutledge, please.
- Please hold.

662
00:47:04,418 --> 00:47:05,783
Name, please?

663
00:47:05,853 --> 00:47:07,946
You tell him
Captain Colter Stevens is calling.

664
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:10,923
- Hold the line.
- All aboard.

665
00:47:10,991 --> 00:47:12,322
Doors are closing.

666
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:14,918
Dr. Rutledge
will be on in a moment.

667
00:47:17,498 --> 00:47:19,864
I have to tell you something.

668
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:21,629
- I know. I found him.
- Your friend?

669
00:47:21,702 --> 00:47:25,934
- I got him. Nellis Air Force Base. Las Vegas.
- No, he's not...

670
00:47:26,907 --> 00:47:28,101
He's dead, Sean.

671
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:30,902
What?

672
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:35,444
I'm sorry. Your friend was killed
in action two months ago.

673
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,948
No, you must've gotten the name wrong.

674
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:40,543
Colter Stevens.
17th Airborne helicopter pilot.

675
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:42,088
It was on the first site I tried.

676
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:47,120
His father's name is Donald, right?

677
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:50,360
This is from last week.

678
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:53,195
"Donald Stevens will join host,
Leonard Watt, to discuss

679
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:56,498
"the death of his son,
Army Captain Colter Stevens,

680
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,731
"who died in Afghanistan in February,

681
00:47:58,806 --> 00:48:01,798
"and was honored posthumously
with a silver star.

682
00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:05,735
"Also on the broadcast
will be Army Sergeant Robert Alvarez,

683
00:48:05,813 --> 00:48:07,678
"whose life was saved by Captain Stevens

684
00:48:07,748 --> 00:48:10,478
"in a fire fight just outside of Kandahar."

685
00:48:13,654 --> 00:48:14,643
I'm sorry.

686
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:17,214
Captain?

687
00:48:19,927 --> 00:48:22,293
Sean? Talk to me.

688
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:24,263
Captain?

689
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:28,234
Captain Stevens,
my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.

690
00:48:28,302 --> 00:48:31,237
You're with Operation Beleaguered Castle.
You're safe.

691
00:48:34,642 --> 00:48:35,631
Hey, this guy's crashing!

692
00:48:38,612 --> 00:48:42,173
Captain, just tell me what you see.
Just look and speak.

693
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:44,012
I see a card.

694
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:47,278
That's good.

695
00:48:47,488 --> 00:48:50,150
Do you copy?
We are taking a lot of RPG fire here.

696
00:48:50,224 --> 00:48:51,316
That's very good.

697
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:03,861
Am I dead?

698
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:13,905
A radio listing is saying that I died
in a helicopter crash, in country,

699
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:15,107
and my father received a medal for me.

700
00:49:15,182 --> 00:49:16,774
Your condition's not the issue here.

701
00:49:17,217 --> 00:49:19,549
You need to focus on preventing
any subsequent attack.

702
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,178
Everything else is irrelevant.

703
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:24,415
A news report saying that I'm dead
is irrelevant?

704
00:49:24,725 --> 00:49:29,185
Until the person or persons
who blew up that train are in custody, yes.

705
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:32,193
Goodwin,

706
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:37,029
one soldier to another, am I dead?

707
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:50,850
Part of your brain remains activated.

708
00:49:53,153 --> 00:49:55,212
What about the rest of me?
I can see my hands and my feet.

709
00:49:55,289 --> 00:49:56,415
They still move.

710
00:49:57,157 --> 00:49:58,647
They are a manifestation.

711
00:49:58,726 --> 00:50:01,092
They're just your way of making sense
of all this.

712
00:50:01,962 --> 00:50:05,921
So, what are you saying?
Are you saying that I'm imagining this?

713
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:11,263
I'm imagining that I'm still alive,
that I'm in this capsule?

714
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,410
We have core temp dropping.

715
00:50:48,642 --> 00:50:49,666
Captain, what just happened?

716
00:50:56,483 --> 00:50:57,575
I asked you a question.

717
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:03,154
The capsule is a manifestation as well.

718
00:51:04,224 --> 00:51:05,282
Where am I?

719
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:07,115
That's classified.

720
00:51:08,395 --> 00:51:09,521
Fuck you!

721
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,336
Captain, I cannot imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

722
00:51:17,938 --> 00:51:21,499
But if we're to prevent a second attack,
we need to send you back immediately.

723
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:25,011
And, Captain,
you cannot deviate from the mission

724
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:26,307
while inside the source code,

725
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,745
even to investigate your...

726
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:31,150
Even to investigate what happened to you.

727
00:51:31,418 --> 00:51:34,945
There's only one continuum on this end
and it can't be unsettled.

728
00:51:35,255 --> 00:51:38,884
Well, you know what? I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.

729
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,893
Just before the explosion,
so at 7:46 this morning,

730
00:51:42,963 --> 00:51:46,524
- they paged you with a call from me.
- You may have made that call from the train,

731
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,400
but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.

732
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:51,938
If the call even went through,

733
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:55,099
it would be received
by a different me entirely.

734
00:51:56,176 --> 00:52:01,307
This may be difficult for you to hear,
but you are a hand on a clock, understand?

735
00:52:01,381 --> 00:52:04,475
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.

736
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:08,043
And that represents the entirety
of your function here.

737
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:09,783
You know what?
Next time I'll send you a pizza!

738
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:11,547
I'll see if that makes an impression!

739
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:16,255
You cannot alter the continuum
of this reality from within the source code.

740
00:52:16,864 --> 00:52:18,126
This can't be legal, what you're doing.

741
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:21,725
In fact, your acquisition by this program
as well as the program itself

742
00:52:21,802 --> 00:52:24,464
has been reviewed and sanctioned
by military court.

743
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:31,337
Many soldiers would find this
preferable to death.

744
00:52:31,411 --> 00:52:34,869
The opportunity to continue
serving their country.

745
00:52:36,717 --> 00:52:40,278
Have you spent much time in battle, sir? Huh?

746
00:52:40,721 --> 00:52:42,416
That's immaterial.

747
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:46,750
Any soldier I've ever served with would say
that one death is service enough.

748
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:51,128
Fine. You can have that in return
for completing this mission.

749
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:54,429
- Have what?
- I'll give you what you want.

750
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:57,463
Terminate your service. Let you die.

751
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:01,830
This is taking too long.

752
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:04,370
You've been too easy on him.
No more rest periods.

753
00:53:07,514 --> 00:53:10,176
I am certain we can find other servicemen

754
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,480
with wounds similar to yours
who would consider

755
00:53:12,553 --> 00:53:14,817
being a part of this program an honor.

756
00:53:14,988 --> 00:53:17,980
What? No, wait, what?

757
00:53:18,692 --> 00:53:20,182
Send him back.

758
00:53:21,195 --> 00:53:22,287
Charge the drivers.

759
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:30,331
And Captain Stevens,
I'd like you to remember

760
00:53:30,404 --> 00:53:33,271
that it's not only about you,
but it's also about

761
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,969
two million real-world Americans.
Now, you may not value your own life,

762
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:39,939
I do, however, ask that you value theirs.

763
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:42,070
Your advice.

764
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:43,905
Hey, Grandpa.

765
00:53:55,229 --> 00:53:58,027
Calm yourself. You're back.
Did you find the bomber?

766
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:02,268
There are hundreds of people on that train.

767
00:54:03,103 --> 00:54:05,196
Well, then check them out one by one.

768
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:08,701
It doesn't matter what you do to them.
They're already dead.

769
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:10,936
Get to that gun,
and shoot someone if you have to.

770
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:12,774
But get us some usable intel.

771
00:54:13,513 --> 00:54:14,571
No, wait!

772
00:54:27,661 --> 00:54:29,959
We have to keep doing this
until you find the bomber.

773
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,157
Please. I'm trying. I'm trying.

774
00:54:32,499 --> 00:54:33,523
Who is the bomber?

775
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:36,893
I'm trying.

776
00:54:39,506 --> 00:54:43,772
I'm sorry, Captain. I know you're exhausted,
and we're all frustrated,

777
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:46,210
but we cannot fail. You can do this.

778
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:48,780
I can't. I can't.

779
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:50,383
Yes, you can.

780
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:52,578
You're a born hero, son.

781
00:54:53,086 --> 00:54:54,576
Even your father thinks so.

782
00:54:55,822 --> 00:54:57,585
Saving people is what you do best.

783
00:55:00,227 --> 00:55:01,421
It was about his third tour.

784
00:55:02,562 --> 00:55:04,359
- I didn't want him to go back.
- Dad?

785
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:07,093
I just started feeling like
he didn't want to come home anymore.

786
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:09,431
- Dad?
- Like somehow, he couldn't come home.

787
00:55:10,304 --> 00:55:13,102
And he wouldn't talk to me,
wouldn't hear me.

788
00:55:14,141 --> 00:55:17,577
Finally he said he just couldn't leave
his unit out there without him,

789
00:55:17,644 --> 00:55:18,975
and that was that.

790
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:22,940
Those guys were his family.

791
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:27,718
I said some things I shouldn't have.
I don't know,

792
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:32,549
I never fully understood him.

793
00:55:32,626 --> 00:55:33,888
And I can't believe he's gone.

794
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,691
Send me back in.

795
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,630
Please don't blow me up again.

796
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,066
Hello?

797
00:56:47,134 --> 00:56:48,726
I know it's you.

798
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:51,929
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

799
00:56:52,005 --> 00:56:54,337
I'm gonna find you. Turn around.

800
00:56:57,511 --> 00:56:59,502
- Hey, there.
- Me?

801
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,645
Why do you look so surprised?

802
00:57:06,386 --> 00:57:07,546
Don't.

803
00:57:10,223 --> 00:57:12,555
Move. I said move. Move.
Put your bag over there.

804
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:13,650
- Okay.
- Move over.

805
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,194
- Put the bag over there and move over.
- Okay, okay.

806
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:18,425
Move over. Move over.
Now hand me your phone.

807
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:21,634
- You're done. You're done.
- What?

808
00:57:21,935 --> 00:57:23,232
You can't kill anybody anymore.

809
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:24,801
What? I don't understand.

810
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:26,429
You were going to trigger the bomb
with your phone.

811
00:57:26,506 --> 00:57:30,875
What? Dude, I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

812
00:57:31,611 --> 00:57:36,071
Listen, my name's George Troxel.
I'm a software engineer, okay?

813
00:57:36,149 --> 00:57:37,844
- Right.
- I was talking to my wife.

814
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:40,986
Try it again.

815
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:43,882
Your call. Dial it again.

816
00:57:45,225 --> 00:57:47,557
Okay. I'm gonna press redial.

817
00:57:48,195 --> 00:57:51,096
Your phone is gonna ring,
and then I'm gonna shoot you.

818
00:57:54,868 --> 00:57:57,666
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.

819
00:58:01,808 --> 00:58:02,832
Hey!

820
00:58:03,243 --> 00:58:04,904
You dropped this.

821
00:58:05,512 --> 00:58:07,002
Wow. Thanks.

822
00:58:13,954 --> 00:58:15,046
Hey!

823
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:40,778
All aboard. Doors are closing.

824
00:58:42,749 --> 00:58:44,546
Shit! No! No!

825
00:58:46,419 --> 00:58:47,545
No!

826
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:50,586
Wait!

827
00:58:53,627 --> 00:58:55,254
No! Come on!

828
00:59:09,743 --> 00:59:10,937
Stop the train!

829
00:59:35,302 --> 00:59:36,394
Hey!

830
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,066
Hey!

831
00:59:50,717 --> 00:59:52,412
- Derek Frost.
- Yes?

832
00:59:53,186 --> 00:59:54,847
- See this?
- Yes.

833
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:57,082
- You recognize it?
- No.

834
01:00:00,026 --> 01:00:01,357
Jesus.

835
01:00:03,663 --> 01:00:05,358
How about you give me your wallet?

836
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:07,226
Okay.

837
01:00:10,136 --> 01:00:12,036
You left it on the train deliberately.

838
01:00:12,906 --> 01:00:15,875
I must have dropped it.

839
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:17,403
No.

840
01:00:17,978 --> 01:00:20,811
You planted it there,
so everybody would think you were dead.

841
01:00:25,685 --> 01:00:26,913
I know it's you.

842
01:00:28,421 --> 01:00:30,082
How do you know so much?

843
01:00:36,796 --> 01:00:38,991
What the hell is that thing?

844
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,532
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!

845
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:46,402
Do you wanna see it?

846
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:48,301
Very patriotic.

847
01:00:49,509 --> 01:00:50,737
Slowly, slowly!

848
01:00:57,183 --> 01:00:59,378
All right, all right!
Back up! Back up! Back up!

849
01:01:07,027 --> 01:01:10,519
Not many people could build that.

850
01:01:17,671 --> 01:01:20,037
All right. Where is your next target?

851
01:01:20,373 --> 01:01:21,362
Sean?

852
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:26,377
Oh, my God!

853
01:01:57,711 --> 01:01:59,303
Sean Fentress?

854
01:02:01,247 --> 01:02:02,475
Teacher.

855
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:04,644
History.

856
01:02:07,187 --> 01:02:08,848
I don't know you.

857
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:12,150
I think I killed your girlfriend.

858
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:14,820
Why?

859
01:02:15,929 --> 01:02:17,487
You messed up my timing.

860
01:02:18,264 --> 01:02:20,027
- Why?
- Oh.

861
01:02:21,034 --> 01:02:22,797
You mean "Why this?"

862
01:02:25,305 --> 01:02:29,435
Because the world is hell.

863
01:02:30,977 --> 01:02:33,377
But we have a chance to start over
in the rubble.

864
01:02:34,147 --> 01:02:35,910
But first there has to be rubble.

865
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:39,778
You're a teacher, you understand.

866
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:10,347
Christina.

867
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:15,084
Stay with me. Stay with me.

868
01:03:20,527 --> 01:03:22,654
Everything's gonna be okay.

869
01:03:29,569 --> 01:03:31,002
This isn't the end.

870
01:03:33,573 --> 01:03:35,837
Check through there. I'll go check this way.

871
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,149
- Okay.
- This is Beleaguered Castle.

872
01:04:30,763 --> 01:04:34,597
Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.

873
01:04:41,674 --> 01:04:46,202
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.

874
01:04:46,279 --> 01:04:48,645
I have your bomber. I have his name.

875
01:04:53,953 --> 01:04:55,648
You have the bomber's name?

876
01:04:55,822 --> 01:04:56,811
Derek Frost.

877
01:05:01,828 --> 01:05:06,128
He got into a rented white van
in the Glenbrook Station parking lot.

878
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:10,465
Illinois plates, five, Charlie,
Golf, Yankee, eight, four, seven.

879
01:05:10,803 --> 01:05:13,704
Illinois plates, 5CGY847.

880
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:15,940
All right, let's move.

881
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:19,868
And Goodwin, there is
a radioactive device in the van.

882
01:05:19,946 --> 01:05:21,607
Some kind of bomb.

883
01:05:21,748 --> 01:05:22,737
Thank you, Captain.

884
01:05:22,815 --> 01:05:23,907
Yes, ma'am.

885
01:05:24,717 --> 01:05:27,584
Thank you, Captain.
You are now off the clock.

886
01:05:28,187 --> 01:05:29,882
About our deal?

887
01:05:29,956 --> 01:05:34,359
I had hoped that you might reconsider that,
for the sake of the program.

888
01:05:35,028 --> 01:05:36,791
I have. I want something else now.

889
01:05:37,564 --> 01:05:38,724
Good.

890
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:42,364
I still wanna die.

891
01:05:42,735 --> 01:05:44,362
But I want to go back in

892
01:05:44,437 --> 01:05:46,530
and I wanna save all those people
on that train first.

893
01:05:46,606 --> 01:05:48,870
It doesn't work that way. It can't.

894
01:05:48,942 --> 01:05:50,534
No, I know. I know, I know.

895
01:05:51,578 --> 01:05:55,139
I'm not really asking you to believe me, sir.
I'm just...

896
01:05:55,248 --> 01:05:58,411
I'm asking you
to have the decency to let me try.

897
01:06:00,887 --> 01:06:03,651
CPD-2, this is AU SWAT-1.

898
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:07,153
Van is approaching fence gate
to the quarry. Over.

899
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:10,423
Roger that, AU SWAT-1.
Allow the vehicle to enter the quarry road.

900
01:06:10,496 --> 01:06:13,226
We'll stop him about halfway down. Over.

901
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:18,431
AU SWAT-2, this is CPD-2.
Block the east end of the road. Over.

902
01:06:18,504 --> 01:06:20,301
AU SWAT-2, roger that.

903
01:06:20,607 --> 01:06:24,202
We're going to switch
now to a live feed from our Chicago affiliate.

904
01:06:24,277 --> 01:06:26,973
The SWAT team
is approaching the white van.

905
01:06:27,046 --> 01:06:29,412
The Illinois man has been sought
since early this morning.

906
01:06:29,515 --> 01:06:32,313
The door is open
and the man is on the ground.

907
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:33,784
It appears he has surrendered.

908
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:37,119
Earlier today,
the police discovered...

909
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:39,522
Congratulations, Captain.

910
01:06:39,592 --> 01:06:43,688
In recent months, Frost started posting
anti-government statements on his website.

911
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,897
Yes, sir, it's a real validation
of the program.

912
01:06:46,966 --> 01:06:50,663
A clear window into
just how revolutionary source code can be.

913
01:06:50,737 --> 01:06:54,264
We finally have a powerful weapon now
in the war on terror.

914
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:57,704
Congratulations, Captain. A job well done.

915
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:02,107
He's not gonna send me back in,
is he, Goodwin?

916
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,541
I'm still waiting on an answer.

917
01:07:10,189 --> 01:07:11,451
Are you married, Captain?

918
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:13,050
Um...

919
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,554
Joe?

920
01:07:15,962 --> 01:07:17,293
Why don't you go take a break?

921
01:07:17,363 --> 01:07:19,957
- You deserve to celebrate.
- Sure.

922
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:21,193
Can I get you something?

923
01:07:21,434 --> 01:07:23,026
No, I'm fine.

924
01:07:26,606 --> 01:07:28,801
Why? Are you asking me on a date?

925
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:30,365
Sorry. Poor taste.

926
01:07:30,977 --> 01:07:32,638
- Are you married?
- Hmm?

927
01:07:33,513 --> 01:07:34,537
No.

928
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:36,871
I am divorced.

929
01:07:38,317 --> 01:07:41,582
Do you think
there's an alternate version of you?

930
01:07:42,255 --> 01:07:43,950
A Goodwin who made different choices?

931
01:07:45,124 --> 01:07:46,785
What do you mean?

932
01:07:47,393 --> 01:07:50,794
Like, a you who didn't get married
and get divorced.

933
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:53,093
Or just married someone else.

934
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,394
A woman who took
a different fork in the road.

935
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:01,504
No, I don't, Captain.

936
01:08:02,842 --> 01:08:05,333
What you experienced was a shadow.

937
01:08:05,712 --> 01:08:08,704
It was an afterimage of a victim on a train.

938
01:08:09,649 --> 01:08:12,140
This is real life. Here.

939
01:08:13,252 --> 01:08:15,550
The one where you're talking to
a dead helicopter pilot?

940
01:08:21,294 --> 01:08:23,626
The program wasn't designed
to alter the past.

941
01:08:23,796 --> 01:08:27,288
It was designed to affect the future.
And you've done that.

942
01:08:27,366 --> 01:08:29,561
I missed something, Captain.

943
01:08:30,203 --> 01:08:31,898
That train shouldn't have blown up.

944
01:08:31,971 --> 01:08:33,461
There must have been a second detonator,

945
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:35,063
something I couldn't see. A fail-safe.

946
01:08:37,143 --> 01:08:39,577
It's a computer program, Captain.

947
01:08:40,179 --> 01:08:43,774
The girl on the train, all the others,
they're lost.

948
01:08:44,884 --> 01:08:46,317
I'm sorry about that.

949
01:08:46,385 --> 01:08:47,716
I get it. I get it.

950
01:08:48,187 --> 01:08:51,179
I know.
Quantum physics, parabolic calculus.

951
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:53,758
You're wrong, Goodwin.

952
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,725
You're just plain wrong.

953
01:08:56,095 --> 01:08:57,653
Captain, Christina is dead.

954
01:08:59,165 --> 01:09:01,463
She doesn't have to be, ma'am.

955
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:05,096
Okay. I'll ask Rutledge.

956
01:09:05,438 --> 01:09:07,030
I'm asking you,

957
01:09:08,508 --> 01:09:10,373
I'm asking you. Just...

958
01:09:13,012 --> 01:09:14,001
Send me...

959
01:10:09,969 --> 01:10:11,231
Captain.

960
01:10:11,838 --> 01:10:13,499
It's your choice.

961
01:10:15,741 --> 01:10:19,871
At the end of this source code,
I will terminate your life support.

962
01:10:25,918 --> 01:10:28,182
There will be no coming back.

963
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,216
I'm gonna save her, Goodwin.

964
01:10:36,495 --> 01:10:38,520
It was an honor, Captain.

965
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:43,134
And I thank you for your service.

966
01:10:44,637 --> 01:10:46,002
Good luck.

967
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,181
I took your advice.

968
01:11:05,191 --> 01:11:07,523
You're gonna move to India,
and become a guru.

969
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,389
Careful, ma'am.

970
01:11:09,462 --> 01:11:12,556
Yeah, I'm gonna go
find myself in the mountains.

971
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:17,500
Well, maybe you'll have a cup of coffee
with me before you go.

972
01:11:18,337 --> 01:11:21,306
Yeah. I'd like to do that. Put it to the test.

973
01:11:21,974 --> 01:11:23,134
Good.

974
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:25,503
Let's do it today.

975
01:11:25,578 --> 01:11:29,639
Let's just skip work.
Bryan can find someone else to assist him.

976
01:11:33,986 --> 01:11:35,851
- You know what?
- What?

977
01:11:36,689 --> 01:11:38,452
I feel really good.

978
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:40,350
Why?

979
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,553
Because I've been waiting for weeks
for you to ask me for coffee.

980
01:11:51,737 --> 01:11:52,965
Ticket?

981
01:11:54,974 --> 01:11:56,134
Okay.

982
01:11:57,076 --> 01:11:59,840
Just give me a couple minutes, okay?
And I'll be right back.

983
01:11:59,912 --> 01:12:01,937
Gotta go save the world.

984
01:12:05,084 --> 01:12:07,052
I knew he was a keeper.

985
01:12:36,048 --> 01:12:37,413
Excuse me!

986
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:45,589
Beautiful day.

987
01:12:45,658 --> 01:12:48,821
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

988
01:12:49,595 --> 01:12:50,755
Ticket?

989
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:52,263
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

990
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:54,731
Glenbrook Station, next stop.

991
01:12:57,436 --> 01:12:59,495
- You trust the DOD?
- They've got the finances.

992
01:12:59,572 --> 01:13:00,937
Yeah, well, sure.

993
01:13:01,007 --> 01:13:04,272
Look, if we can get the funding,
I guarantee we can have at least...

994
01:13:05,978 --> 01:13:09,675
Eight source code projects up and running
by the end of the year.

995
01:13:09,749 --> 01:13:12,274
- Really? That many?
- Maybe more.

996
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:13,818
You're a real hero, Dr. Rutledge.

997
01:13:14,286 --> 01:13:15,651
Well, thank you.

998
01:13:16,455 --> 01:13:18,389
We did save lives today.

999
01:13:18,457 --> 01:13:20,425
Yes, a true victory for the program.

1000
01:13:20,493 --> 01:13:22,017
A great victory for us all.

1001
01:13:22,094 --> 01:13:23,721
We'll talk soon.

1002
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:27,394
So? Exciting times.

1003
01:13:28,734 --> 01:13:31,567
Let's initialize the memory wipe on SC-1,

1004
01:13:32,004 --> 01:13:33,369
start crunching the data.

1005
01:13:34,073 --> 01:13:35,335
Sir,

1006
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:39,443
we told Captain Stevens

1007
01:13:39,512 --> 01:13:40,979
that we were gonna let him die.

1008
01:13:42,048 --> 01:13:43,538
Let him die?

1009
01:13:43,983 --> 01:13:46,315
He just saved millions of lives today.

1010
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:48,615
How many other disasters
might he avert down the line?

1011
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:50,780
For all we know, he may be

1012
01:13:50,856 --> 01:13:54,019
the only candidate
with which the system works.

1013
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,188
So,

1014
01:13:56,662 --> 01:13:58,630
let's clear his memory

1015
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:00,821
and reinitialize source code.

1016
01:14:01,434 --> 01:14:02,765
Shall we?

1017
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,171
Yes, sir.

1018
01:14:14,146 --> 01:14:16,046
Sorry, I just dropped...

1019
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:18,777
Hey, Derek! This isn't your stop.

1020
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:20,341
Hey, mister!

1021
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,581
You dropped this.

1022
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:25,557
Come on back here.

1023
01:14:28,027 --> 01:14:29,016
Oops.

1024
01:14:59,725 --> 01:15:00,919
Derek,

1025
01:15:02,595 --> 01:15:03,823
it's over.

1026
01:15:05,798 --> 01:15:07,231
You understand?

1027
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:13,870
Hey. My name is Derek Frost.

1028
01:15:13,939 --> 01:15:16,134
I planted a nuclear device in a white van

1029
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:19,636
parked in the Glenbrook Station CCR
parking lot.

1030
01:15:19,712 --> 01:15:21,407
Right now I'm handcuffed to a pole

1031
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:25,109
on the 944 CCR train
headed to Chicago Union Station.

1032
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:28,447
I am a sick and pathetic human being.

1033
01:15:28,888 --> 01:15:32,187
And I need to be locked away
for a very long time.

1034
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:35,953
Okay.

1035
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:39,197
Derek,

1036
01:15:39,999 --> 01:15:43,196
there's no more
burying the world in rubble today.

1037
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,431
You mind if I borrow this?

1038
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:55,378
Captain, some of the guys and I
are gonna go celebrate.

1039
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:56,503
And...

1040
01:15:57,583 --> 01:16:00,916
Do you want me to initiate
the memory wipe, Captain?

1041
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:32,975
Hello, Captain.

1042
01:16:42,595 --> 01:16:45,496
- Hello?
- Donald Stevens?

1043
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:46,588
Yes?

1044
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:54,134
My name is Sean Fentress.

1045
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,402
Who?

1046
01:16:56,942 --> 01:16:59,035
I served with your son, Colter.

1047
01:17:02,648 --> 01:17:04,377
- Oh, boy.
- It's...

1048
01:17:07,052 --> 01:17:10,146
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to call you.

1049
01:17:11,624 --> 01:17:15,754
Sometimes it just takes a while to figure out
what you want to say. You know?

1050
01:17:17,129 --> 01:17:21,361
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I imagine it's not an easy call to make.

1051
01:17:27,873 --> 01:17:29,773
How are you doing, sir?

1052
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:34,711
Well, all that came back was some ash.

1053
01:17:36,915 --> 01:17:39,543
It's hard to believe that it was him.

1054
01:17:48,294 --> 01:17:49,886
How well did you know him?

1055
01:17:55,834 --> 01:17:58,064
I was there when he died, sir.

1056
01:17:58,904 --> 01:18:00,166
He said

1057
01:18:01,607 --> 01:18:06,442
that the last time
that you guys talked was tough,

1058
01:18:08,347 --> 01:18:09,439
and

1059
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,445
he wanted to say that he was sorry.

1060
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:21,148
I just want him back.

1061
01:18:46,919 --> 01:18:48,716
I loved him so much.

1062
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:57,751
I wish you could have told him that.

1063
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:01,999
He knows it.

1064
01:19:05,337 --> 01:19:07,464
You take care, Mr. Stevens.

1065
01:19:36,034 --> 01:19:37,058
You okay?

1066
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:40,060
Yeah.

1067
01:19:41,106 --> 01:19:42,698
Save the world?

1068
01:19:43,675 --> 01:19:44,664
Sort of.

1069
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:47,642
So, where were we?

1070
01:19:49,548 --> 01:19:51,311
Getting some coffee.

1071
01:19:53,318 --> 01:19:54,808
Dr. Rutledge.

1072
01:19:57,055 --> 01:19:58,044
What?

1073
01:20:08,267 --> 01:20:09,427
Shit.

1074
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:12,899
What's so damn hard about it?
I run a business, okay?

1075
01:20:12,971 --> 01:20:14,495
Everything moves on time
or people get fired.

1076
01:20:14,573 --> 01:20:16,006
That's the way it works in the real world.

1077
01:20:16,074 --> 01:20:18,406
- Ten minutes.
- Hey, buddy?

1078
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:21,536
Don't sweat the small stuff. You'll drown.

1079
01:20:22,247 --> 01:20:24,715
Thank you for that moment of Zen,
but nobody was talking to you.

1080
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:28,617
What, are you selling self-help CDs today?
Why don't you just mind your own business.

1081
01:20:28,821 --> 01:20:33,190
Security? Get me a detachment of MPs here
this instant!

1082
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,553
Why are you always so bitter, Max?

1083
01:20:37,062 --> 01:20:40,589
It's a bitter world we live in, my friend.
What do you want from me?

1084
01:20:42,534 --> 01:20:44,434
It doesn't have to be.

1085
01:20:45,571 --> 01:20:49,871
I will bet you $100 you can't make
all these people on this train laugh.

1086
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:53,842
Oh. Right.

1087
01:20:56,014 --> 01:20:59,677
Actually, you know what? 126 bucks.

1088
01:21:00,385 --> 01:21:02,410
Is that your way of making fun of me?

1089
01:21:02,488 --> 01:21:04,012
I guess you have a better gig. Never mind.

1090
01:21:04,089 --> 01:21:05,681
No, no. I'm good.

1091
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:08,425
Easiest money ever.

1092
01:21:08,494 --> 01:21:10,018
- Come on.
- Excuse me, people.

1093
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:15,728
One of our fellow passengers has decided to
offer me some money to...

1094
01:21:15,801 --> 01:21:19,328
What has gotten into you today?
You're like a different person.

1095
01:21:19,404 --> 01:21:21,702
- It's the new me.
- I like it.

1096
01:21:23,141 --> 01:21:26,736
I am going to prosecute you
to the full extent of the law.

1097
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,970
Women always mess up my last name.

1098
01:21:30,048 --> 01:21:32,676
I was with a girl the other night
and she kept calling me "Getoff."

1099
01:21:32,751 --> 01:21:35,015
She was like, "Getoff! Getoff!"
I'm like, "No, Denoff, Denoff."

1100
01:21:35,087 --> 01:21:37,453
She says,
"No, you're fat and you're heavy. Get off!"

1101
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:41,224
Good?

1102
01:21:41,293 --> 01:21:42,851
Twenty seconds.

1103
01:21:42,928 --> 01:21:44,395
Make it ten.

1104
01:21:46,465 --> 01:21:47,454
Goodwin?

1105
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:52,337
Look at all this.

1106
01:21:52,437 --> 01:21:54,769
It's good to see you, ladies,
up this early in the morning.

1107
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,535
- What?
- Michelle. Barack.

1108
01:21:58,844 --> 01:22:00,505
All this life.

1109
01:22:06,785 --> 01:22:10,221
Goodwin. Open this door.

1110
01:22:20,365 --> 01:22:22,663
Put those headphones on.
I wanna see them stretch.

1111
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:25,225
- Why do you keep looking at your watch?
- Christina,

1112
01:22:25,938 --> 01:22:27,667
what would you do

1113
01:22:28,607 --> 01:22:30,939
if you knew you had
less than a minute to live?

1114
01:22:37,516 --> 01:22:39,746
I'd make those seconds count.

1115
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,885
I'd kiss you again.

1116
01:22:43,555 --> 01:22:45,022
Again? Mmm.

1117
01:22:46,224 --> 01:22:48,590
Goodwin, open this goddamn door!

1118
01:22:50,028 --> 01:22:51,552
He's done enough, Doctor.

1119
01:23:52,858 --> 01:23:54,951
And, I'm on the train...

1120
01:24:14,446 --> 01:24:16,744
Everything's gonna be okay.

1121
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,627
It is a beautiful Monday
in Chicago today.

1122
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:33,858
Temperatures expected to
reach the lower 60s.

1123
01:24:33,932 --> 01:24:37,299
Right now 55 at the lakefront, 54 at Midway,

1124
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:38,563
53 at O'Hare.

1125
01:24:38,637 --> 01:24:40,264
And now, up in the sky, we've got...

1126
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:44,365
He earned that money.

1127
01:24:44,443 --> 01:24:45,603
- Yeah, he did.
- He was funny.

1128
01:24:45,677 --> 01:24:48,874
- Speaking of which, I have no cash.
- Great.

1129
01:24:49,448 --> 01:24:52,246
Come here. I wanna show you something.

1130
01:24:52,484 --> 01:24:54,577
- Such a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1131
01:24:54,653 --> 01:24:56,746
It is a really perfect day.

1132
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:10,828
Do you believe in fate?

1133
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:14,662
Not really.
I'm more of a dumb luck kind of gal.

1134
01:25:15,674 --> 01:25:17,403
- Come here.
- Wow.

1135
01:25:34,226 --> 01:25:36,456
So what do you wanna do today?

1136
01:25:37,829 --> 01:25:40,627
I think we should stay here for a while.

1137
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,593
This feels like exactly where
we're supposed to be, doesn't it?

1138
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:53,570
Las Vegas' number one
morning news follows.

1139
01:25:53,645 --> 01:25:56,375
It's 72 degrees
on a cloudy Monday morning.

1140
01:25:56,448 --> 01:26:00,714
This is News Radio 840KX
in North Las Vegas.

1141
01:26:00,786 --> 01:26:03,118
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Captain.

1142
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:09,055
Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and an opera cloak.

1143
01:26:10,896 --> 01:26:12,921
In her hand were five playing cards.

1144
01:26:16,201 --> 01:26:18,226
At some point today,
you're gonna hear about

1145
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:22,103
a failed terrorist attack
on a commuter train near Chicago.

1146
01:26:23,008 --> 01:26:24,976
You and I kept that bomb from going off.

1147
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:29,470
An attempted bombing on a CCR train
outside Chicago.

1148
01:26:29,748 --> 01:26:33,582
But it was thwarted,
and the suspect was found on board,

1149
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:37,153
- named Derek Frost.
- Derek Frost.

1150
01:26:42,527 --> 01:26:45,462
Captain Goodwin,
anything I can help you with?

1151
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:51,135
No, that's fine. I'll come back later.

1152
01:26:55,907 --> 01:26:57,534
Keep an eye out.

1153
01:26:58,977 --> 01:27:02,310
One of these days the right crisis

1154
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,473
is going to rear its head

1155
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:08,913
and source code is going to
have its moment in the sun.

1156
01:27:09,254 --> 01:27:10,585
Yes, sir.

1157
01:27:18,496 --> 01:27:19,929
If you're reading this e-mail,

1158
01:27:19,998 --> 01:27:24,230
then source code works even better
than you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.

1159
01:27:24,302 --> 01:27:27,203
You thought you were creating
eight minutes of a past event,

1160
01:27:27,272 --> 01:27:28,739
but you're not.

1161
01:27:28,807 --> 01:27:31,799
You've created a whole new world.

1162
01:27:32,844 --> 01:27:36,940
Goodwin, if I'm right,
somewhere at the source code facility

1163
01:27:37,015 --> 01:27:40,781
you have a Captain Colter Stevens
waiting to send on a mission.

1164
01:27:40,852 --> 01:27:44,879
Promise me you'll help him.
And when you do, do me a favor.

1165
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:48,088
Tell him everything is gonna be okay.

1166
01:27:49,088 --> 01:28:05,088
