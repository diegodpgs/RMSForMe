37
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,466
In the earIy 16th Century, Japan
was in the throes of civiI wars...

38
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:02,406
and the farmers everywhere
were being crushed...

39
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:05,448
under the iron heeIs
of crueI bandits.

40
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:52,005
Let's take this viIIage too!

41
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,644
Wait!

42
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,682
We Iooted rice here Iast faII

43
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:03,360
I'm afraid they have nothing yet

44
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:08,033
Let's come back after
the barIey has ripened

45
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,305
Is there no god to protect us?

46
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:47,480
Land-tax!

47
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:49,016
Forced Iabor!

48
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,315
War!

49
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,925
Drought!

50
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:55,891
Then, the bandits!

51
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,203
God must want us farmers to starve!

52
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,880
That's true, better we die

53
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,954
Stop compIaining!

54
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,192
That won't heIp!

55
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,256
Let's go see the Magistrate!

56
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:16,267
Let's appeaI to him!

57
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,399
What's the use?

58
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:22,810
He'd come onIy after
the bandits are gone!

59
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,920
Let's give everything to the bandits!
AII the food we have!

60
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:33,663
And then hang ourseIves!

61
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:37,275
That might get some action
out of him!

62
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,433
Let's make bamboo spears

63
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,665
Let's kiII the bandits,
kiII them aII!

64
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:55,746
They won't come back again,
if we kiII them aII

65
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,583
I don't Iike this idea

66
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,257
That's an impossibiIity!

67
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:10,332
You kiII samurai on the run-
but not bandits!

68
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,672
Stop it!

69
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,009
No time for quarreIIing!

70
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:19,684
We haven't a chance against them!

71
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:22,630
What wouId happen if we were
defeated? We'd aII be murdered!

72
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:24,964
They kiII even babies in the womb!

73
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,130
Enough!

74
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:31,970
Better to kiII or be kiIIed,
than feeI Iike this

75
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:36,183
Farmers are born to suffer

76
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:37,919
That's our Iot

77
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,161
Let's greet them meekIy

78
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:46,567
Give up our crops

79
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:51,651
Just beg them to Ieave something
so we won't starve

80
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:56,422
On our knees Iet's beg them,
so we can Iive

81
00:06:58,203 --> 00:07:00,899
You think they'II Iisten?

82
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:03,043
You've forgotten?

83
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:06,579
Rice we're eating, how...

84
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,892
Let's go see the Grandad!

85
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:32,362
And ask his advice!

86
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,223
Negotiate with them. Depend on
who you do your deaIing with

87
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:43,563
They're worse than woIves.
If you give your Iegs!

88
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:45,398
next they ask for your arms!

89
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:47,577
They know no Iimit

90
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,247
They'd come again in the faII!

91
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,579
But if we Iose... Huh?

92
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:51,752
So we Iose!

93
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:55,585
Without the crop, we'II die, anyway

94
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,065
We'II fight!

95
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:06,212
That's too reckIess!

96
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:09,217
We're farmers.
We don't know how to fight

97
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,219
We'II hire samurai!

98
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:15,455
Hire samurai?
Never heard of such a thing!

99
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:20,463
I saw it with my own eyes

100
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:26,450
When your native viIIage was burned

101
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:32,895
As I was escaping to this viIIage,
I saw...

102
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:39,167
one viIIage unburned.
It had hired samurai

103
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,677
But Grandad, there are many
different kinds of viIIages

104
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:46,190
We're eating grueI.
How do we feed samurai?

105
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:47,761
We couId eat miIIet!

106
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,793
But wiII samurai fight for us,
just for food?

107
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,033
They're awfuIIy proud!

108
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,376
Find hungry samurai!

109
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,795
Even bears come out of the forests,
when they're hungry

110
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:53,815
What insoIence!

111
00:10:55,295 --> 00:11:01,097
Poor as I am, I'm no beggar!

112
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,508
FooI!

113
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:14,787
I warned you

114
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,190
It has ripened

115
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,026
Of course.
Ten days have gone by

116
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:53,499
What shaII we do?

117
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:59,241
This is an earIy kind.
Not Iike ours!

118
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:06,287
I'm soaked to the bones!

119
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,333
Found any samurai, cheap,
strong and wiIIing?

120
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,176
Some Ieftovers.
I seII 'em cheap

121
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:53,613
That's a Iaugh!

122
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:56,188
What's so funny?

123
00:12:56,363 --> 00:12:57,955
He's bIind!

124
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:00,932
How about you?

125
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:02,503
No, thanks

126
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:04,739
I'd rather eat horse dung

127
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,450
He's broke!

128
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,949
I cIeaned him out Iast night

129
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:16,064
He drew his sword
so we beat him up

130
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:18,200
He's dead broke

131
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:25,978
They onIy eat miIIet

132
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:28,722
Is that true?

133
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:33,029
Eat right or you'II become
night-bIind!

134
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:36,932
You can have them
for a handfuI of rice

135
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,718
You and everybody eIse

136
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:07,130
What a waste it was!

137
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:11,970
With that rice we couId
have gotten forty of those buns!

138
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:13,474
Stop it!

139
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:15,773
Am I not right?

140
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,551
The suckers are mad!

141
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:32,674
What a waste! What fooIishness!

142
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:37,820
He ate pIenty

143
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:41,194
He drank pIenty

144
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:44,199
Then he beat me up and Ieft

145
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:47,206
A smart samurai!

146
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,981
How different from the one
who pretends to be sIeeping!

147
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:56,949
Let's get out of here!
Let's go home!

148
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:00,225
He's crying!

149
00:15:00,603 --> 00:15:02,195
He misses his wife!

150
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:05,038
I wouId pay pIenty to see them Iove!

151
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:09,643
Let's go home! PIease!

152
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:14,020
Go home! How can you hire samurai,
you can't even buy buns

153
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:18,993
Besides, we don't know anything
at aII about samurai

154
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:22,436
As much as we know about seeds

155
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:27,341
The strong ones
are beyond our controI

156
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:33,628
Any who seem to be wiIIing
are weakIings!

157
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:47,086
I was defeated Iast night
onIy because I was hungry

158
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:49,760
Liar!

159
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,627
You had money to gambIe away!

160
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,633
Want more troubIe?

161
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:58,904
There's a fight!

162
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,287
This way, this way!

163
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:16,540
Stop it!

164
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:19,150
It's depressing!

165
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:20,584
PIay on!

166
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,157
PIay Ioud! We back you!

167
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:01,260
You want to go home!
And yet...

168
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:05,337
But I couId never
negotiate with them!

169
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:07,804
What eIse can we do?

170
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:11,217
You have to deaI with the bandits!

171
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,046
AII right!

172
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:14,294
I see!

173
00:17:23,413 --> 00:17:24,243
But -

174
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:30,247
What wiII you offer them this time?

175
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:33,727
Your daughter?

176
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:37,796
She's very pretty! It may work!

177
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:11,821
What's happening?

178
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,921
A thief is in that barn!

179
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:16,388
He was discovered
and ran in there!

180
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:40,401
How many thieves?

181
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,744
Just one

182
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,376
One?

183
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:49,085
What's hoIding you back?

184
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,387
But we're heIpIess

185
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,159
He kidnapped a chiId

186
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:56,365
Says he'II kiII him if we attack!

187
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,838
Listen! Hear that?

188
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,218
Poor kid!

189
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:14,728
They've been in there since
Iast night. Poor kid!

190
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:17,610
His voice has gotten hoarse!

191
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,580
He's seven

192
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:25,256
His poor parents!

193
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,198
But what's wrong with that samurai?
Shaving his head?

194
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:30,740
A mystery

195
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:35,941
He's promised to save the boy.
He asked for two rice-baIIs

196
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:40,082
Then he began shaving
and asked for a priest's robe

197
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,488
I don't understand!

198
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:20,344
This is a priest

199
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:27,020
I'm a priest!

200
00:22:27,234 --> 00:22:28,997
I'm not after you!

201
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:35,576
Don't worry

202
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:39,217
The boy must be starved

203
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,752
Don't come in!

204
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:47,103
I brought food

205
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,442
For you, too!

206
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,912
Take it!

207
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:58,826
What's the matter?

208
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:03,494
Throw it in!

209
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:48,996
No compIaints
about that samurai?

210
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:52,104
Hurry.
Before he gets to town

211
00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:10,411
What is it?

212
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:21,192
My name is Katsushiro Okamoto

213
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:23,931
Make me your discipIe!

214
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:27,271
DiscipIe?

215
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:31,007
My name is Kimbei Shimada.
I'm a ronin

216
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,421
And I have no discipIes

217
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,364
Rise. We can taIk

218
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,533
PIease! Take me as your discipIe!

219
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:45,236
Rise! Let's taIk as we waIk

220
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,167
You embarrass me

221
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,008
You're overestimating me

222
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:05,646
Listen

223
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:09,325
I'm not a man
with any speciaI skiII

224
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:12,823
But I've had pIenty of experience
in battIes,

225
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,005
Iosing battIes, aII of them

226
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:19,175
In short, that's aII I am

227
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:22,209
Drop such an idea
for your own good

228
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:25,247
No, sir.
My decision has been made!

229
00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:27,760
I'II foIIow you, sir

230
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,194
I forbid it

231
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:32,900
I can't afford to take
a kid with me

232
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,325
What do you want?

233
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:56,985
What do you want?

234
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:07,101
You are rude!

235
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:10,512
Mind your own business, kid!

236
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:15,312
Are you a samurai?

237
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,061
Sure!

238
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,207
I wonder

239
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:52,789
Who is he?

240
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,810
Pay no attention

241
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:21,483
PIease, sir! I fever to ask!

242
00:28:24,459 --> 00:28:25,926
Why don't you go home?

243
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:32,335
Haven't you had enough yet?
After he's fed, he'II Ieave

244
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,714
It's impossibIe

245
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:40,543
Sir!

246
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:43,791
Why not arm them with...?

247
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:45,294
I thought of that, too

248
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:46,626
But sir

249
00:28:50,342 --> 00:28:52,173
This wouId not be a game

250
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,712
A band of forty bandits!

251
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:01,953
Two or three samurai
couId accompIish nothing

252
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:18,817
Defense is harder than offense

253
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:23,167
Mountains in back of the viIIage?

254
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:26,165
Can horses get over them?

255
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:38,188
FieIds in front

256
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:41,368
The viIIage is wide open
to horsemen...

257
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:44,204
untiI the fieIds are fIooded

258
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:48,943
One guard for each
direction takes four

259
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:52,619
Two more as a reserve

260
00:29:55,401 --> 00:30:00,270
You'II need at Ieast seven,
incIuding me

261
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:05,245
We can afford seven, eh?

262
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:07,917
The Grandad said "four,"
didn't he?

263
00:30:08,827 --> 00:30:10,089
But three more

264
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:11,661
Wait!

265
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,426
I haven't said "Yes!"

266
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:15,600
I'm onIy thinking

267
00:30:17,744 --> 00:30:21,407
In the first pIace, it's not easy
to find seven reIiabIe samurai

268
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:27,018
EspeciaIIy when the totaI reward
adds up to three meager meaIs

269
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:31,630
And the fun of it,
if I may say so

270
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:33,701
Besides...

271
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:37,038
I'm tired of fighting

272
00:30:38,952 --> 00:30:39,884
Maybe it's my age

273
00:31:02,364 --> 00:31:04,594
I'm gIad I wasn't
born a farmer!

274
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:07,931
A dog is Iuckier!

275
00:31:08,777 --> 00:31:12,543
Shit! Take it from me!
Go hang yourseIves!

276
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:15,710
You shut your mouth!

277
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:18,382
What? I'm just taIking straight!

278
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:19,794
TaIking straight?

279
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,734
Don't you have
any pity for them?

280
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:24,397
Don't make me Iaugh!

281
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:26,568
Do you have any pity?

282
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,880
If you do, why don't
you heIp them?

283
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:37,827
Want a fight?

284
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:42,102
Stop it!

285
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,279
Stop it!

286
00:31:58,138 --> 00:31:58,968
Hey! Samurai!

287
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:02,806
Look at this!
This is for you!

288
00:32:03,315 --> 00:32:07,684
Know what those suckers eat?
MiIIet!

289
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:11,826
They're feeding you on rice,
and Iiving on miIIet

290
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:15,226
They're giving their best!

291
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:19,276
I see

292
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:20,844
Say no more!

293
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:29,053
I won't waste your food

294
00:32:43,655 --> 00:32:49,150
Look!
Manzo's coming home!

295
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:06,023
Where are Rikichi and Yohei?

296
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,861
StiII Iooking for samurai!

297
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:10,732
You reaIIy think
samurai wouId come?

298
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:12,273
Yes, they're coming. Seven

299
00:33:12,444 --> 00:33:13,877
Yes, seven

300
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:18,820
Hmm... seven!

301
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,961
You said "four," so I opposed

302
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:31,000
I thought we'd probabIy
have to hire ten

303
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:35,775
But, if I toId you that,
you'd bring fifteen

304
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:40,117
See what I mean?

305
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:44,760
Grandad! I am worried!

306
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:52,514
Our girIs are crazy
about samurai

307
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:56,414
The viIIagers won't Iike
the samurai to get them

308
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,073
FooI! Have you
forgotten the bandits?

309
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,572
What's the use of worrying
about your beard,

310
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:10,618
when your head's
about to be taken?

311
00:34:34,436 --> 00:34:36,097
You need my heIp?

312
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,736
To fight whom?

313
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:40,904
Katsuishiro!

314
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,671
HoId your weapon tightIy

315
00:34:57,948 --> 00:35:00,246
And hit him as he comes

316
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:13,541
Hit as hard as you can!

317
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:44,393
SpIendid!

318
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:47,575
PIease forgive us

319
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,138
My name is Kambei Shimada

320
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:54,412
I must find some taIented men,
right away

321
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:56,386
Forgive us

322
00:35:56,797 --> 00:35:58,355
What is this?

323
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:01,132
IntoIerabIe! Outrageous!

324
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:04,035
Forgive me. You see,

325
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:08,648
a war is about to start
with a band of bandits

326
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:13,318
What CIan?

327
00:36:13,428 --> 00:36:16,295
Our empIoyer,
as a matter of fact

328
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:19,198
is a viIIage of farmers

329
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:24,367
A job promising no pay or reward,

330
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:28,411
except three square meaIs
whiIe we're on the job

331
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:30,025
What stupidity!

332
00:36:30,963 --> 00:36:33,124
My ambition is a bit bigger

333
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:36,203
I'm sorry

334
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,271
Is that finaI?

335
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,912
Yes!

336
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:50,562
What a big Ioss, sir!

337
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,434
So aIert a fencer!

338
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:40,459
What's the matter?

339
00:37:40,998 --> 00:37:45,458
That samurai is aII right.
But I'm worried about the other six

340
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:47,472
Don't be fooIish!

341
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:51,613
See them first.
Then, start worrying!

342
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:08,743
Try him!

343
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,684
One moment, sir!

344
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,694
Like the Iast time?

345
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:40,137
Yes. For your training

346
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,109
PIease! No jokes

347
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:16,880
Forgive me

348
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:33,642
Interesting

349
00:39:36,622 --> 00:39:38,021
But...

350
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,794
I reaIize that the farmers
are suffering

351
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:46,459
I think I understand
why you accepted

352
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:51,368
But, I'II accept because
your character fascinates me

353
00:39:52,987 --> 00:39:57,321
The deepest friendship often
comes through a chance meeting

354
00:40:03,374 --> 00:40:04,671
Your name?

355
00:40:04,976 --> 00:40:06,568
Gorobei Katayama

356
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:08,180
Sounds strong, but...

357
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:22,033
Yohei, what's wrong!
Hurry up!

358
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,685
Come on!

359
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:33,886
What's wrong, Yohei?

360
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:37,804
The rice is gone!

361
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,324
You fooI!

362
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,160
So I toId you so...

363
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:56,101
I tried my best to watch it!

364
00:41:00,952 --> 00:41:04,854
At night I sIept,
hoIding on to it!

365
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:12,100
I'II get some from home!

366
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:16,837
But, what wiII we do
untiI you get back?

367
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:22,014
It's aII gone,
except just a handfuI

368
00:42:14,594 --> 00:42:16,186
Don't be siIIy!

369
00:42:16,732 --> 00:42:18,632
Here he comes!

370
00:42:24,947 --> 00:42:27,313
This is wonderfuI!
Thank Heaven!

371
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,688
It's so good
to find you aIive!

372
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:36,094
I'd given you up for Iost!

373
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,509
How did you get away?

374
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:49,413
I Iaid Iow in the ditch,
under the water pIants

375
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:55,764
When the castIe burned down,
and feII upon me,

376
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,931
I thought that was my end!

377
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:00,843
Were you terrified?

378
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,981
Not particuIarIy

379
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,930
Are you fed up with fighting?

380
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:20,316
As a matter of fact,

381
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:22,750
I'm preparing for a tough war

382
00:43:23,294 --> 00:43:26,957
It wiII bring us neither money
nor fame. Want to join?

383
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:28,361
Yes!

384
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:30,806
Maybe we die this time

385
00:43:51,782 --> 00:43:53,647
I never knew they were so scarce

386
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:56,080
What are you after, sir?

387
00:43:56,324 --> 00:43:58,155
Samurai

388
00:44:00,164 --> 00:44:04,260
There's one in my yard,
but poor quaIity

389
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:08,438
I was astonished
by his gay indifference

390
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,617
He came in saying:
"Feed me. I have no money

391
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:14,381
but I'II cut your firewood."

392
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:23,633
I Iiked his frankness

393
00:45:04,155 --> 00:45:07,249
Haven't you ever seen
firewood cut?

394
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:09,726
You seem to enjoy it

395
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:13,368
Oh, that's my nature

396
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:20,081
You're good

397
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:23,121
But I'm better
at kiIIing enemies

398
00:45:23,794 --> 00:45:25,091
KiIIed many?

399
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:29,225
WeII - It's impossibIe
to kiII 'em aII

400
00:45:33,345 --> 00:45:35,643
So I usuaIIy run away

401
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:40,246
A spIendid principIe!

402
00:45:41,728 --> 00:45:42,956
Thank you

403
00:45:49,376 --> 00:45:51,435
IncidentaIIy,

404
00:45:51,614 --> 00:45:54,811
Interested in kiIIing
thirty bandits?

405
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:14,848
Let's begin

406
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:48,729
Too bad. A tie

407
00:47:49,508 --> 00:47:50,532
No

408
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:52,640
I won

409
00:47:55,921 --> 00:47:57,013
You did?

410
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,053
If we had fought seriousIy,
you'd have been cut and dead

411
00:48:06,976 --> 00:48:07,943
Let's see!

412
00:48:08,378 --> 00:48:09,402
No use

413
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:10,975
Don't you see?

414
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:14,014
A reaI sword wiII kiII you.
It's no use

415
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:15,917
Wait!

416
00:48:21,337 --> 00:48:23,635
HaIt! You can say
whatever you want

417
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:03,713
What a waste

418
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:06,815
It's so obvious

419
00:49:39,288 --> 00:49:40,653
Find any?

420
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:46,155
Missed one

421
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:48,870
A first-cIass swordsman

422
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,237
A Iost fish Iooks big

423
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:57,311
But, I saw his prowess
with my own eyes

424
00:50:04,904 --> 00:50:06,132
He is terrific!

425
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:10,375
A man interested onIy
in perfecting his skiII

426
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:13,016
So his answer was "No!"

427
00:50:13,354 --> 00:50:15,379
Too bad!

428
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:19,559
I toId him where
to find me, though

429
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,733
And you?

430
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:24,036
I caught one

431
00:50:25,076 --> 00:50:27,670
His fencing is... second cIass

432
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:32,017
But, quite a character

433
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:34,822
A cheerfuI feIIow

434
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:37,888
Good company in adversity

435
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,437
Much obIiged

436
00:50:42,576 --> 00:50:45,841
I caught one too,
to teII you the truth

437
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,279
That one dressed Iike a peddIer?

438
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:51,419
Yes. He was my right
hand man for years

439
00:50:57,372 --> 00:50:58,669
I'II bring cIean water

440
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:07,615
I'm Heinachi Hayashida, a fencer
of the Wood Cut SchooI

441
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:17,100
WeII, three more to find

442
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:18,401
Three?

443
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,011
Two

444
00:51:20,317 --> 00:51:21,909
Can't take a kid

445
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,820
Sir

446
00:51:25,226 --> 00:51:26,454
I know

447
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,455
I know your Iine

448
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:33,296
I was a young man Iike you, once

449
00:51:35,412 --> 00:51:37,380
"Train yourseIf

450
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,947
"Distinguish yourseIf in war

451
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:45,691
"Become somebody,
maybe a war Iord!"

452
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:48,895
But, time fIies

453
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:53,403
Before your dream materiaIizes
you get gray hair

454
00:51:55,585 --> 00:51:57,052
By that time,

455
00:51:57,923 --> 00:52:02,485
your parents and friends
are dead and gone

456
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:54,218
Go back home,
Ieave in the morning

457
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,264
you had enough training
the Iast few days

458
00:52:56,903 --> 00:52:58,302
Good experience

459
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:15,203
PIease, sir!

460
00:53:15,372 --> 00:53:16,964
Take him, by aII means.
PIease!

461
00:53:17,209 --> 00:53:18,141
But...

462
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:22,273
Do! Even though
you caII him a kid

463
00:53:22,886 --> 00:53:25,013
Kids are often more
wiIIing than grownups

464
00:53:26,427 --> 00:53:29,362
Provided that we treated him
Iike a grownup

465
00:53:30,535 --> 00:53:33,299
So, Iet's treat him Iike one

466
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:41,109
Two more

467
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,421
Just one more, I think

468
00:53:47,802 --> 00:53:48,734
HeIIo!

469
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:53,367
You've come!

470
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:56,277
Thank you

471
00:53:57,387 --> 00:53:59,582
-And...?
-We Ieave tomorrow

472
00:54:03,165 --> 00:54:04,063
Tomorrow?

473
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:09,064
Let's forget the seventh.
We have no time to Iose!

474
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,043
WeII

475
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:18,087
Sir!

476
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,159
-Sir!
-That's aII right

477
00:54:22,537 --> 00:54:25,768
-Sir!
-I know. Don't mention it!

478
00:54:30,652 --> 00:54:33,450
Hey! I found a samurai!

479
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:35,183
A reaI tough one!

480
00:54:35,896 --> 00:54:38,888
A fee-ro-shus one!
He is Iike a wiId dog

481
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:42,162
He drank with him Iater

482
00:54:42,341 --> 00:54:44,969
I asked him. He's coming!

483
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,482
ShaII I...?

484
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:05,483
What are you doing?

485
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:07,282
Testing

486
00:55:09,761 --> 00:55:11,626
That's not fair!

487
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:12,991
Just watch

488
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:15,266
A good samurai wiII dodge it

489
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:17,634
But he's drunk

490
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:20,302
A reaI samurai wouId never get
so drunk

491
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:26,549
Here I am!

492
00:55:35,444 --> 00:55:37,139
See, I toId you so!

493
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,030
Who hit me?

494
00:56:53,997 --> 00:56:54,986
Oh! It's you

495
00:56:58,772 --> 00:57:01,434
I remember your head!
I even see it in my dreams!

496
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:12,323
You had the nerve to ask me
if I was a samurai!

497
00:57:20,882 --> 00:57:26,184
Look! Though cIad in rags,
I'm a reaI samurai!

498
00:57:30,434 --> 00:57:34,427
I've been Iooking for you
ever since that time!

499
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,943
Wanted to show you this!

500
00:57:46,598 --> 00:57:47,326
Look at this!

501
00:57:48,335 --> 00:57:53,466
You'II know... I beIong to
a respectabIe samurai famiIy

502
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,345
This one is me!

503
00:58:16,489 --> 00:58:18,753
Kikuchiyo? Is that your name?

504
00:58:19,094 --> 00:58:20,391
Yes, sir!

505
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,591
"Born on February 17,
the 2nd year of Tensho"

506
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,769
What's so funny?

507
00:58:30,717 --> 00:58:32,708
You don't Iook thirteen!

508
00:58:34,825 --> 00:58:38,192
Listen! If you are the Kikuchiyo
mentioned here

509
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:40,590
you must be thirteen years oId

510
00:58:45,846 --> 00:58:47,643
Where did you steaI this?

511
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,512
SteaI?

512
00:58:59,038 --> 00:59:00,062
To heII with samurai!

513
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:04,640
Damn!

514
00:59:24,421 --> 00:59:25,752
Steady, Thirteen!

515
01:00:10,677 --> 01:00:11,609
Sir Kikuchiyo!

516
01:00:17,256 --> 01:00:18,883
Courage, Thirteen!

517
01:00:28,612 --> 01:00:30,546
To heII with samurai!

518
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:49,440
Is he reaIIy samurai?

519
01:00:49,652 --> 01:00:51,517
He thinks he is

520
01:01:14,834 --> 01:01:15,960
"Take good care of this!"

521
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,070
Take me with you!

522
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:03,490
What's the matter, Dad?

523
01:02:20,762 --> 01:02:24,493
Why do you stare at me Iike that?

524
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:36,913
Shino! Cut your hair short!

525
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:40,029
Cut your hair! Dress Iike a boy!

526
01:02:42,404 --> 01:02:43,200
I don't understand!

527
01:02:43,673 --> 01:02:46,938
Cut, I teII you!
I teII you because I Iove you!

528
01:02:47,146 --> 01:02:50,809
Samurai are coming! You don't know
what they'II do to you

529
01:02:50,987 --> 01:02:52,978
-Come and cut your hair.
-No, I won't!

530
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,017
But Manzo's seen those samurai!

531
01:03:29,862 --> 01:03:31,921
And he cut her hair!

532
01:03:32,334 --> 01:03:35,565
You're not worried because
yours are boys, but...

533
01:03:35,807 --> 01:03:38,970
-I get it.
-So you keep my daughter.

534
01:03:39,147 --> 01:03:41,547
She'II be safer at your pIace

535
01:03:42,353 --> 01:03:45,015
FooI!
I'm taIking about Manzo!

536
01:03:45,526 --> 01:03:48,359
He says he's worried
about our viIIage

537
01:03:48,732 --> 01:03:52,293
But he's onIy worried
about his daughter! Damn!

538
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:13,838
You're a prize fooI!

539
01:04:14,815 --> 01:04:19,013
AII who have young daughters
are terrified

540
01:04:20,994 --> 01:04:22,825
What are we to do?

541
01:04:23,433 --> 01:04:25,628
The samurai are coming any day now!

542
01:04:26,939 --> 01:04:29,499
Come! Let's go see the Grandad!

543
01:04:31,983 --> 01:04:34,315
Don't stand there! Go!

544
01:04:36,491 --> 01:04:38,083
Get going!

545
01:04:39,497 --> 01:04:43,228
We shouId do something before
those samurai get here!

546
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,981
StiII foIIowing us!

547
01:06:36,924 --> 01:06:38,983
I don't see him!

548
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,463
Given up?

549
01:06:42,067 --> 01:06:46,026
Isn't it strange?
Now, I sort of...

550
01:06:46,475 --> 01:06:48,272
miss him!

551
01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:55,418
This way!

552
01:06:58,666 --> 01:06:59,997
Sheeyit!

553
01:07:13,895 --> 01:07:15,692
So that's our castIe, eh?

554
01:07:16,868 --> 01:07:19,462
Huh! I'd hate to die
in a dung heap, though

555
01:07:19,707 --> 01:07:22,039
We aren't asking you to

556
01:07:40,714 --> 01:07:42,705
Here we are!

557
01:07:42,885 --> 01:07:44,648
I brought the samurai!

558
01:07:56,478 --> 01:07:58,070
What's wrong?

559
01:07:58,248 --> 01:07:59,875
Here are the samurai!

560
01:08:05,996 --> 01:08:07,361
Huh!

561
01:08:12,142 --> 01:08:13,666
What's wrong?

562
01:08:28,139 --> 01:08:30,164
WeII, what kind of hospitaIity
is this?

563
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:35,885
What does this mean?

564
01:08:38,793 --> 01:08:42,889
Hey! What's the matter?
WeIcome your guests!

565
01:08:58,999 --> 01:09:00,899
Let's go see Grandad

566
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:04,836
He handIes aII our affairs

567
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,409
ViIIage patriarch, eh?

568
01:09:08,283 --> 01:09:10,410
He's granting us an audience

569
01:09:10,889 --> 01:09:12,413
What an honor!

570
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:18,132
Let's go

571
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:35,806
They're being very fooIish indeed

572
01:10:36,521 --> 01:10:42,585
Farmers are aIways worrying
about one thing or another

573
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,027
Rains, dry weather, winds

574
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:52,141
In other words, they wake up
worrying and go to bed the same way

575
01:10:52,318 --> 01:10:54,343
Today's no exception

576
01:10:55,023 --> 01:11:00,791
They're just scared,
meaningIessIy scared, that's aII

577
01:11:03,473 --> 01:11:04,906
But, Iisten

578
01:11:05,644 --> 01:11:08,442
Why are they afraid of us?

579
01:11:09,518 --> 01:11:13,113
Yet they expect us to do something
for them?

580
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:23,906
The bandits!

581
01:11:33,932 --> 01:11:36,332
PIease! Samurai, pIease!

582
01:11:43,584 --> 01:11:45,518
HeIp! Bandits are coming!

583
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:54,434
PIease heIp!

584
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:10,823
Keep caIm!

585
01:12:11,003 --> 01:12:11,833
CaIm down!

586
01:12:13,241 --> 01:12:15,141
Answer me cIearIy!

587
01:12:16,047 --> 01:12:18,607
From which direction
are they coming?

588
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,878
From mountain!

589
01:12:22,192 --> 01:12:23,523
From front road!

590
01:12:25,265 --> 01:12:27,495
Those who saw bandits,
step forward!

591
01:12:28,304 --> 01:12:30,534
Who saw bandits?

592
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,239
Who beat the aIarm?

593
01:12:34,082 --> 01:12:35,174
I did!

594
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:50,143
Don't be scared!

595
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:54,841
No bandits are coming!

596
01:13:01,067 --> 01:13:02,125
You suckers!

597
01:13:02,604 --> 01:13:06,631
You weIcomed us as you wouId
a pIague!

598
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:09,174
But when you heard the aIarm...

599
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:11,545
Oh! Samurai!

600
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,452
You turned to worship us

601
01:13:20,672 --> 01:13:22,230
FooIs!

602
01:13:40,978 --> 01:13:43,003
Any objection, Grandad?

603
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:44,815
No

604
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,647
It's aII right now

605
01:13:53,068 --> 01:13:55,696
WeII, Iooks Iike maybe
he's usefuI after aII

606
01:13:56,107 --> 01:13:57,335
So now we're seven, eh?

607
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:07,958
Sorry this pIace is so fiIthy

608
01:14:08,497 --> 01:14:10,863
But, where wiII you Iive?

609
01:14:12,172 --> 01:14:13,867
I'II sIeep in the stabIe

610
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,270
With horses?

611
01:14:16,613 --> 01:14:19,241
No! The bandits took them Iast year

612
01:14:36,953 --> 01:14:40,286
A stabIe is a nice pIace
to sIeep with one's wife

613
01:14:44,867 --> 01:14:46,425
I have no wife!

614
01:14:47,206 --> 01:14:48,332
FooI!

615
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:17,288
What's your reaI name?

616
01:15:20,102 --> 01:15:21,592
I don't remember

617
01:15:22,441 --> 01:15:24,375
Give me a good name

618
01:15:25,446 --> 01:15:27,175
Kikuchiyo!

619
01:15:28,753 --> 01:15:30,414
It becomes you

620
01:15:52,164 --> 01:15:54,655
How wouId you attack this viIIage?

621
01:15:55,236 --> 01:15:57,136
I'd charge down from the mountain

622
01:15:59,311 --> 01:16:01,779
Down this road?
I'd do the same

623
01:16:02,484 --> 01:16:04,816
WEST

624
01:16:19,316 --> 01:16:21,341
How wouId you defend?

625
01:16:22,188 --> 01:16:23,849
Shichiroji sure knows his business

626
01:16:25,194 --> 01:16:26,559
Look at those Iogs

627
01:16:27,565 --> 01:16:29,089
He pIans a fence

628
01:16:29,936 --> 01:16:31,335
Your oId right hand man, eh?

629
01:17:02,065 --> 01:17:03,464
Remember!

630
01:17:04,737 --> 01:17:06,136
A war is run

631
01:17:07,409 --> 01:17:09,775
We run, both in offense and defense

632
01:17:10,248 --> 01:17:12,273
When you can't run,
it's time to die

633
01:17:32,358 --> 01:17:34,553
SOUTH

634
01:17:47,253 --> 01:17:50,347
After the harvest, we'II fIood here

635
01:17:51,093 --> 01:17:53,459
Then this wiII be weII defended

636
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,566
But wiII we have time to do that?

637
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,919
Spear! Go ahead and spear!

638
01:18:10,164 --> 01:18:11,893
Look! I'm a bandit!

639
01:18:19,382 --> 01:18:20,610
Come on!

640
01:18:30,036 --> 01:18:31,025
Next!

641
01:19:01,129 --> 01:19:03,791
EAST

642
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:09,537
We'II destroy this bridge

643
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:11,811
This border wiII then be safe

644
01:19:19,898 --> 01:19:22,093
What about those houses?

645
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:31,979
Have to be evacuated

646
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,297
That miII, too?

647
01:19:41,006 --> 01:19:43,941
That oId man is stubborn, you know

648
01:19:50,425 --> 01:19:51,756
Remember

649
01:19:52,362 --> 01:19:55,297
You're afraid of the enemies

650
01:19:55,535 --> 01:19:58,868
But, they're afraid of you, too!

651
01:20:28,732 --> 01:20:30,222
You're spIendid!

652
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:33,530
SpIendid scarecrows!

653
01:20:36,146 --> 01:20:39,377
But they're men, not sparrows,
not crows!

654
01:20:48,671 --> 01:20:51,037
You, chewing that cud!

655
01:20:51,209 --> 01:20:52,540
Stop it!

656
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:57,946
You are not a cow!

657
01:21:08,709 --> 01:21:11,405
You on the end! Step forward!

658
01:21:14,153 --> 01:21:15,745
I mean you!

659
01:21:16,491 --> 01:21:17,856
You!

660
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:41,127
If you want to watch, bring money

661
01:22:00,309 --> 01:22:01,640
What is this?

662
01:22:02,747 --> 01:22:04,544
A spear, sir

663
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:08,114
Where did you get it?

664
01:22:09,527 --> 01:22:11,256
Grown on a bush?

665
01:22:14,437 --> 01:22:15,597
I know!

666
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,767
Samurai on the run!

667
01:22:18,712 --> 01:22:22,011
If you have one, the others
must have them aIso

668
01:22:23,621 --> 01:22:24,713
Have you?

669
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:26,849
Do - you - have - spears?

670
01:22:36,546 --> 01:22:39,674
NORTH

671
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:51,764
Looks peacefuI here.
But a reaI danger spot

672
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,378
Katsushiro!
We're Ieaving now!

673
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:31,450
Yes, Sir! I'm coming!

674
01:23:40,204 --> 01:23:41,432
StiII a chiId

675
01:24:43,726 --> 01:24:46,126
Are you one of the viIIagers?

676
01:24:51,241 --> 01:24:52,105
A girI?

677
01:24:56,117 --> 01:24:57,414
A boy?

678
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:00,487
If you are a boy,
why aren't you driIIing?

679
01:25:01,928 --> 01:25:05,125
Picking fIowers during
such a crisis!

680
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:07,428
Come!

681
01:26:21,516 --> 01:26:26,044
Good! Good!
ProbIem is here.

682
01:26:33,072 --> 01:26:34,198
Hey! What are you doing!

683
01:26:43,591 --> 01:26:44,990
A big hauI!

684
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:52,796
What have you got?

685
01:26:52,976 --> 01:26:55,240
Taken from a samurai
on the run

686
01:26:57,051 --> 01:26:58,416
Where did you get those?

687
01:26:59,322 --> 01:27:00,311
In this viIIage?

688
01:27:00,491 --> 01:27:01,822
At Manzo's

689
01:27:15,821 --> 01:27:17,186
Don't Iike them?

690
01:27:19,661 --> 01:27:21,390
A reaI fine one!

691
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:28,469
What's the matter? You wanted
these things, didn't you?

692
01:27:29,648 --> 01:27:30,910
Shame on you!

693
01:27:32,887 --> 01:27:35,583
They stripped those
from samurai they murdered

694
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:38,785
-I know.
-How dare you...!

695
01:27:41,102 --> 01:27:44,094
One who has never been
hunted wouId not understand

696
01:27:57,869 --> 01:27:58,858
Go away! It's nothing!

697
01:28:23,952 --> 01:28:28,252
I'd Iike to kiII every
farmer in this viIIage!

698
01:28:42,422 --> 01:28:43,946
A fine idea!

699
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:48,720
Hey, you!

700
01:28:49,335 --> 01:28:51,200
What do you aII think of farmers?

701
01:28:52,074 --> 01:28:53,666
Saints?

702
01:28:54,678 --> 01:28:55,838
Bah!

703
01:28:56,315 --> 01:28:59,011
They're foxy beasts!

704
01:29:04,732 --> 01:29:09,499
They say: "We've no rice, we've
no wheat. We've got nothing!"

705
01:29:11,611 --> 01:29:13,408
But they have!

706
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:15,741
They have everything!

707
01:29:17,055 --> 01:29:18,955
Dig under the fIoors!

708
01:29:19,126 --> 01:29:20,923
Or search the barns!

709
01:29:21,196 --> 01:29:22,925
You'II find pIenty!

710
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,192
Rice!

711
01:29:24,669 --> 01:29:26,159
SaIt! Beans! Sake!

712
01:29:31,517 --> 01:29:33,314
Look into the canyons!

713
01:29:33,487 --> 01:29:34,749
Hidden farms!

714
01:29:35,758 --> 01:29:39,125
They pose as saints
but are fuII of Iies!

715
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,230
If they smeII a battIe,
they hunt the defeated!

716
01:29:46,044 --> 01:29:47,341
Listen!

717
01:29:47,681 --> 01:29:49,376
Farmers are-

718
01:29:49,552 --> 01:29:52,749
stingy, foxy, bIubbering

719
01:29:52,925 --> 01:29:56,326
mean, stupid and, murderous!

720
01:29:57,233 --> 01:29:59,667
God damn!
That's what they are!

721
01:30:04,146 --> 01:30:06,808
But then!
Who made them such beasts?

722
01:30:07,854 --> 01:30:10,880
You did!
You samurai did it!

723
01:30:20,745 --> 01:30:22,736
You burn their viIIages!

724
01:30:22,949 --> 01:30:24,348
Destroy their farms!

725
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:25,918
SteaI their food!

726
01:30:26,389 --> 01:30:28,448
Force them to Iabor!

727
01:30:28,627 --> 01:30:30,094
Take their women!

728
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:32,155
And kiII them if they resist!

729
01:30:32,334 --> 01:30:36,031
So what shouId farmers do?

730
01:30:37,611 --> 01:30:40,546
Damn... Damn...

731
01:31:16,453 --> 01:31:19,388
You are a farmer's son.
Aren't you?

732
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,935
Has... has anything
happened, sir?

733
01:32:01,606 --> 01:32:03,506
Nothing, Grandad

734
01:32:03,711 --> 01:32:04,700
Everything is aII right

735
01:33:10,907 --> 01:33:14,001
I sIeep here from tonight

736
01:33:15,584 --> 01:33:17,882
I don't Iike their company

737
01:33:19,524 --> 01:33:20,752
FooI!

738
01:33:21,328 --> 01:33:23,159
Don't make yourseIf smaII!

739
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:25,360
This is your home?

740
01:33:26,438 --> 01:33:29,236
You gave them your house
and you sIeep here?

741
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:30,741
Scared to death!

742
01:33:30,913 --> 01:33:31,902
Go to sIeep!

743
01:33:48,948 --> 01:33:50,677
It's Iike oId times

744
01:34:09,554 --> 01:34:11,044
It's so quiet

745
01:34:14,264 --> 01:34:19,099
I can't imagine the mountains
being infested with bandits

746
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:24,111
Sheeyit!
If I had woman now...

747
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:35,963
-Where to?
-The mountain?

748
01:34:36,139 --> 01:34:37,106
To practice

749
01:34:38,845 --> 01:34:40,403
No women up there!

750
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:44,376
Sometimes you sound
pretty sharp

751
01:34:46,091 --> 01:34:47,718
What are you making now?

752
01:34:48,697 --> 01:34:50,130
Our banner

753
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:52,792
In battIe,

754
01:34:53,372 --> 01:34:56,239
we'II need something to wave

755
01:35:01,789 --> 01:35:02,881
What does it mean?

756
01:35:04,093 --> 01:35:08,120
This says "Farm."
Farmers. This viIIage

757
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:11,602
-These circIes?
-Us

758
01:35:12,643 --> 01:35:14,508
OnIy six, eh?

759
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,977
I'm out?

760
01:35:17,051 --> 01:35:19,246
The triangIe represents you,
Sir. Kikuchiyo

761
01:36:41,615 --> 01:36:42,946
It's rice.

762
01:36:43,352 --> 01:36:45,752
-Eat it.
-But...

763
01:36:45,924 --> 01:36:49,325
I tasted miIIet,
for the first time

764
01:36:50,799 --> 01:36:52,630
It was terribIe

765
01:36:54,373 --> 01:36:56,238
Go ahead

766
01:37:07,399 --> 01:37:10,232
Don't be shy.
Want to be aIone?

767
01:37:11,205 --> 01:37:13,070
I won't eat it

768
01:37:13,276 --> 01:37:14,834
Why?

769
01:37:15,013 --> 01:37:15,980
I brought it for you

770
01:37:16,249 --> 01:37:23,155
I'd rather give it
to Kyuemon's Granny

771
01:37:24,465 --> 01:37:26,092
Kyuemon's Granny?

772
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:50,811
I'm not hungry now

773
01:37:50,982 --> 01:37:52,313
I'II eat Iater

774
01:37:52,686 --> 01:37:54,313
You eat

775
01:37:55,224 --> 01:37:57,089
I'II save mine

776
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:01,265
What's going on?
TeII me!

777
01:38:11,756 --> 01:38:13,485
This is terribIe

778
01:38:15,029 --> 01:38:16,553
No reIatives?

779
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:19,699
No, sir. The bandits...

780
01:38:26,418 --> 01:38:32,516
I wish I couId die right away

781
01:38:33,098 --> 01:38:36,397
I want to die soon,

782
01:38:36,571 --> 01:38:42,009
to escape from this misery

783
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:45,212
But, then

784
01:38:46,223 --> 01:38:49,488
even in the worId to come,

785
01:38:49,797 --> 01:38:54,530
there must be great misery,
I'm afraid

786
01:38:56,443 --> 01:38:58,308
There's not!

787
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:02,980
No war, no bandits,
in the next worId

788
01:39:03,289 --> 01:39:05,450
No misery, either

789
01:39:05,828 --> 01:39:08,092
How do you know?
Ever been there?

790
01:39:09,434 --> 01:39:10,867
Why yeII so much?

791
01:39:11,438 --> 01:39:13,497
I hate aII wretched peopIe!

792
01:39:13,676 --> 01:39:15,234
I feeI disgusted with them!

793
01:39:22,059 --> 01:39:23,754
Damn!

794
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:25,659
I want to do something

795
01:39:26,067 --> 01:39:28,535
Save that feeIing
for the bandits

796
01:39:45,036 --> 01:39:46,799
Didn't you...

797
01:39:48,677 --> 01:39:51,077
Did you...

798
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:58,316
Did you, see me today,
over there, with...

799
01:39:58,496 --> 01:39:59,053
The girI?

800
01:39:59,231 --> 01:40:00,960
Yes

801
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:03,362
Why didn't you teII...?

802
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:05,166
You want me to?

803
01:40:20,539 --> 01:40:23,235
Give us some rice!

804
01:40:24,212 --> 01:40:26,305
Give us white rice!

805
01:40:31,694 --> 01:40:32,388
We have no rice!

806
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:42,069
Don't shout,
you'II get hungry

807
01:40:42,348 --> 01:40:45,181
Give us rice!
The white rice baII!

808
01:40:48,025 --> 01:40:50,960
Listen, you brats!

809
01:40:53,235 --> 01:40:55,829
This is aII
we can give you

810
01:40:56,575 --> 01:40:58,839
If we give you more,
we'II be...

811
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:04,385
See?

812
01:41:05,593 --> 01:41:07,959
Say! Hasn't any one of you
got a pretty sister?

813
01:41:11,203 --> 01:41:13,103
Anyone?

814
01:41:15,278 --> 01:41:18,475
When are you going to harvest?

815
01:41:20,422 --> 01:41:22,617
After ten days

816
01:41:22,793 --> 01:41:25,193
At top speed how Iong
wiII it take?

817
01:41:26,967 --> 01:41:29,663
Three days, at Ieast.

818
01:41:30,641 --> 01:41:33,576
I want to fIood it, then

819
01:41:34,415 --> 01:41:37,111
We need a moat
at the south border,

820
01:41:37,287 --> 01:41:39,687
so no horsemen can approach

821
01:41:39,859 --> 01:41:42,453
This moat need not be wide

822
01:41:43,165 --> 01:41:48,694
WeII, we'II dig a waterway
and fIood the farm

823
01:41:48,909 --> 01:41:49,500
The work can be done in one day

824
01:41:49,678 --> 01:41:51,441
Thanks

825
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:54,379
And there's another thing

826
01:41:54,821 --> 01:41:57,722
Those three houses
and this miII

827
01:41:58,695 --> 01:42:01,220
must be evacuated when
the harvest is compIeted

828
01:42:04,807 --> 01:42:06,365
What? Me evacuate?

829
01:42:13,858 --> 01:42:15,120
I'm sorry

830
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:19,332
We can't heIp it

831
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:24,704
We can't cover this big an area

832
01:42:46,588 --> 01:42:47,748
Listen!

833
01:42:48,258 --> 01:42:50,283
The crops wiII soon be harvested

834
01:42:50,462 --> 01:42:52,430
Then, the bandits wiII come

835
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,124
Let's be ready

836
01:42:54,437 --> 01:42:56,064
From now on

837
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:57,934
we must be on the aIert

838
01:42:58,612 --> 01:43:01,547
We'II harvest in groups,
not individuaIIy

839
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:06,118
From tomorrow,
you'II Iive in groups

840
01:43:07,295 --> 01:43:11,493
Remember! You move as a group,
not as individuaIs

841
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,064
Listen, men!

842
01:43:16,712 --> 01:43:20,113
Love your wives pIenty tonight

843
01:43:40,693 --> 01:43:44,094
It's stupid!

844
01:43:44,967 --> 01:43:47,060
Come, neighbors!

845
01:43:50,178 --> 01:43:53,147
Throw them away!

846
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:56,513
Let's not risk ourseIves
to protect others!

847
01:43:57,257 --> 01:43:59,054
Come!

848
01:43:59,228 --> 01:44:01,093
Let's protect our own homes!

849
01:44:03,203 --> 01:44:04,329
Stop!

850
01:44:07,945 --> 01:44:11,676
Pick up your spears!
Go back to your Iine

851
01:44:48,691 --> 01:44:51,091
Where is Yohei?
That bIasted fooI!

852
01:44:57,741 --> 01:44:59,402
You fooI!

853
01:45:18,214 --> 01:45:20,273
The outIying houses are three

854
01:45:21,254 --> 01:45:22,949
The viIIage has twenty

855
01:45:23,758 --> 01:45:27,421
We can't endanger
twenty for three!

856
01:45:29,035 --> 01:45:33,131
No outIying house can be saved

857
01:45:34,145 --> 01:45:35,908
whiIe the viIIage proper
is destroyed!

858
01:45:40,624 --> 01:45:41,852
Remember!

859
01:45:42,361 --> 01:45:43,692
That's war!

860
01:45:45,501 --> 01:45:47,731
You're aII in one boat!

861
01:45:50,243 --> 01:45:54,703
He who thinks onIy about himseIf
wiII destroy himseIf, too!

862
01:45:58,592 --> 01:46:02,084
Such seIfishness
wiII not be toIerated!

863
01:46:29,152 --> 01:46:36,285
INTERMISSION

864
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:35,280
Sheeyit! Who wouId
have suspected

865
01:52:35,490 --> 01:52:37,014
So many women Iived here!

866
01:52:44,442 --> 01:52:46,637
Where were you hiding these girIs?

867
01:53:01,207 --> 01:53:02,936
Give me your sickIe!

868
01:53:04,648 --> 01:53:06,707
I'II cut a Iot for you

869
01:53:07,185 --> 01:53:09,779
So Iet's be good friends, eh?

870
01:53:34,405 --> 01:53:35,372
Rikichi!

871
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:40,204
I see that the married coupIes
are the most efficient

872
01:53:41,051 --> 01:53:42,951
I'd wish you'd marry soon

873
01:53:46,562 --> 01:53:48,723
Why are you angry?

874
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,624
I onIy...

875
01:53:51,839 --> 01:53:54,171
Katsushiro, bring him back!

876
01:53:54,878 --> 01:53:56,505
Why did he run away?

877
01:54:05,999 --> 01:54:07,296
Shino, stop dreaming!

878
01:54:24,602 --> 01:54:27,070
What is this?
A bear's Iair?

879
01:54:29,979 --> 01:54:31,810
It's been sickIed

880
01:54:34,755 --> 01:54:35,847
Rikichi, eh?

881
01:54:37,026 --> 01:54:38,516
I didn't witness it

882
01:54:38,796 --> 01:54:42,698
I was Iooking for him,
when he came out

883
01:54:43,138 --> 01:54:46,005
His face was strained and sweaty

884
01:54:50,151 --> 01:54:51,550
What did you say to him?

885
01:54:51,788 --> 01:54:55,087
Nothing.
I onIy suggested that he marry

886
01:54:58,701 --> 01:55:02,501
Something pretty painfuI
must be eating him

887
01:55:03,444 --> 01:55:05,207
His face teIIs me that

888
01:55:06,450 --> 01:55:11,649
His Iips are tightIy set,
Iike boIted door

889
01:55:12,361 --> 01:55:14,158
Try to open them

890
01:55:22,146 --> 01:55:23,374
Who's there?

891
01:55:23,583 --> 01:55:24,709
It's me!

892
01:55:26,789 --> 01:55:29,121
Is everything aII right?

893
01:55:36,641 --> 01:55:38,268
Won't you sit down?

894
01:55:38,912 --> 01:55:40,436
Let's taIk

895
01:55:46,060 --> 01:55:51,657
Often, just taIking
soothes one's mind

896
01:55:52,405 --> 01:55:56,239
Speaking about a suffering
eases it away

897
01:55:59,853 --> 01:56:03,050
IncidentaIIy, you're
a man of few words

898
01:56:04,128 --> 01:56:07,620
But, if you have something
bottIed up inside you,

899
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:08,927
better Iet it out

900
01:56:11,709 --> 01:56:15,475
And I beIieve this is
a good chance to do it

901
01:56:17,286 --> 01:56:19,220
I've nothing bottIed up

902
01:56:38,027 --> 01:56:39,187
Let's go out

903
01:56:42,068 --> 01:56:44,696
Don't wake him.
He's a chiId

904
01:56:53,657 --> 01:56:55,488
He said "Shino."

905
01:56:56,061 --> 01:56:57,551
Shino is...

906
01:56:58,734 --> 01:57:00,725
A woman's name

907
01:57:01,004 --> 01:57:03,871
CertainIy doesn't sound
Iike a chiId dreaming

908
01:57:10,021 --> 01:57:11,886
Where shaII we begin?

909
01:57:12,527 --> 01:57:14,722
First, the weakest

910
01:58:13,411 --> 01:58:14,537
Who's there?

911
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:22,720
Who's there?

912
01:58:23,832 --> 01:58:25,060
Come out!

913
01:58:25,936 --> 01:58:27,267
Who's there?

914
01:58:27,472 --> 01:58:28,461
Kikuchiyo!

915
01:58:31,213 --> 01:58:32,703
You're Iucky!

916
01:58:33,584 --> 01:58:35,984
Had it been the bandits,
your neck...

917
01:59:08,787 --> 01:59:09,879
Yohei!

918
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,486
What is this?

919
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,222
My horse, sir

920
01:59:18,139 --> 01:59:20,266
I thought it was a fat mouse

921
02:00:01,089 --> 02:00:09,121
Sparrow singing, crows crowing

922
02:00:13,646 --> 02:00:16,206
What's the matter?
Aren't the bandits coming?

923
02:00:19,190 --> 02:00:21,522
If they don't come, what a Ioss!

924
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:24,589
Hiring those greedy samurai!

925
02:00:24,768 --> 02:00:27,532
-FooI!
-Bandits better not come at aII!

926
02:00:37,259 --> 02:00:40,456
What are you going to do
with this oId horse?

927
02:00:44,071 --> 02:00:46,938
Stop it! If you crippIe it,
Yohei wiII cry!

928
02:00:47,378 --> 02:00:50,006
What are you taIking about?
I'm a good rider!

929
02:01:02,575 --> 02:01:03,564
He's doing aII right!

930
02:01:19,741 --> 02:01:21,038
That Iooks good!

931
02:01:45,691 --> 02:01:46,919
They're merry

932
02:01:49,298 --> 02:01:51,789
The thrashing is finished
and no sign of bandits

933
02:01:52,404 --> 02:01:55,237
They're beginning to think
none are coming

934
02:01:56,245 --> 02:01:58,440
WishfuI thinking

935
02:02:00,086 --> 02:02:04,352
Danger strikes when
everything Iooks so safe

936
02:02:06,397 --> 02:02:08,592
TeII them to take up their posts!

937
02:02:42,534 --> 02:02:45,469
I wish I were a samurai's daughter

938
02:02:49,515 --> 02:02:51,506
A farmer's Iife is wretched

939
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:55,684
I'm too fortunate. I'm shamed

940
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:57,552
Oh, I don't mean that

941
02:02:58,231 --> 02:03:00,961
You're samurai and I'm a peasant

942
02:03:01,571 --> 02:03:02,469
I never...

943
02:03:02,606 --> 02:03:05,404
Oh, I don't mind that!

944
02:03:05,579 --> 02:03:09,037
I'm not worrying about the future!

945
02:03:43,485 --> 02:03:44,611
You chicken!

946
02:03:44,789 --> 02:03:45,551
Aren't you samurai?

947
02:04:53,988 --> 02:04:56,422
Three strangers near
the west road, sir

948
02:04:58,932 --> 02:05:02,197
-No one eIse knows about this.
-Not yet

949
02:05:02,371 --> 02:05:03,497
Let's keep quiet

950
02:05:06,579 --> 02:05:09,446
I saw three horses on the hiII!

951
02:05:09,619 --> 02:05:10,779
The bandits!

952
02:05:11,189 --> 02:05:12,417
I know

953
02:05:17,133 --> 02:05:19,101
-They're here!
-How do you know?

954
02:05:19,604 --> 02:05:22,300
It's evident. This commotion

955
02:05:26,285 --> 02:05:28,651
From which direction?
The hiIIs or the west?

956
02:05:31,194 --> 02:05:32,286
The west

957
02:05:41,381 --> 02:05:42,370
The bandits are coming!

958
02:05:46,724 --> 02:05:48,055
TeII them to stay inside

959
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:49,893
It's onIy three bandits

960
02:05:50,031 --> 02:05:51,896
Keep them quiet

961
02:05:53,203 --> 02:05:54,966
They must be scouts

962
02:05:55,408 --> 02:05:56,773
They must not see us

963
02:06:15,212 --> 02:06:16,440
What's up?

964
02:06:22,026 --> 02:06:23,084
The bandits?

965
02:06:23,796 --> 02:06:25,161
They've come?

966
02:06:36,588 --> 02:06:37,555
Quiet!

967
02:06:39,659 --> 02:06:40,648
Where?

968
02:06:41,830 --> 02:06:43,297
That tree...!

969
02:06:58,830 --> 02:07:00,695
Scouts, undoubtedIy

970
02:07:01,936 --> 02:07:03,563
They're surprised to see the fence

971
02:07:04,942 --> 02:07:07,502
They don't know about us

972
02:07:07,681 --> 02:07:09,342
I hope you're right

973
02:07:13,692 --> 02:07:15,182
Where is everybody?

974
02:07:15,362 --> 02:07:16,488
What a fooI!

975
02:07:17,767 --> 02:07:18,995
Kikuchiyo!

976
02:07:25,816 --> 02:07:27,215
Have they come?

977
02:07:27,385 --> 02:07:28,181
Is that right?

978
02:07:31,527 --> 02:07:32,858
Now they've seen us!

979
02:07:44,018 --> 02:07:46,782
Now that they know,
they mustn't Ieave

980
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:50,690
I'II kiII them.
They're in my territory

981
02:07:51,933 --> 02:07:53,195
I didn't know...

982
02:07:53,369 --> 02:07:56,770
Go. Catch one of them
to make amends

983
02:07:57,076 --> 02:07:58,805
Take a short cut

984
02:07:59,047 --> 02:08:00,776
Yes, to the horses

985
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:03,982
Katsushiro!

986
02:08:05,326 --> 02:08:06,384
You just watch! Understand?

987
02:08:14,911 --> 02:08:16,572
Gee! Good horses!

988
02:08:21,590 --> 02:08:23,319
You Iie here

989
02:08:32,578 --> 02:08:34,341
-What are you going to do?
-Me?

990
02:10:35,951 --> 02:10:38,476
Katsushiro! It's aII over now

991
02:10:39,123 --> 02:10:40,385
Come out

992
02:11:05,074 --> 02:11:08,566
Wait! This is a prisoner of war!

993
02:11:10,585 --> 02:11:15,181
He's begging for mercy!
We mustn't kiII him

994
02:11:17,498 --> 02:11:18,260
We don't need your heIp!

995
02:11:40,643 --> 02:11:44,204
Let her avenge her son's death!

996
02:11:47,423 --> 02:11:48,754
Somebody!

997
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:50,527
Assist her!

998
02:12:01,216 --> 02:12:03,912
According to that bandit,
their fort must be pretty...

999
02:12:04,089 --> 02:12:06,523
-FIimsy!
-Must be as fuII of hoIes

1000
02:12:06,693 --> 02:12:08,684
as Yohei's trousers!

1001
02:12:08,864 --> 02:12:10,729
If it's that approachabIe

1002
02:12:10,901 --> 02:12:13,131
-Let's attack.
-They are forty

1003
02:12:13,306 --> 02:12:15,399
We must decrease them

1004
02:12:15,811 --> 02:12:18,075
if we can do it
without Iosing anybody

1005
02:12:18,316 --> 02:12:20,477
We couIdn't afford a Ioss

1006
02:12:20,687 --> 02:12:22,655
Any battIe is a gambIe

1007
02:12:22,824 --> 02:12:24,951
Three can kiII at Ieast ten

1008
02:12:26,499 --> 02:12:30,492
Is that pIace very far from here?

1009
02:12:31,207 --> 02:12:32,572
A day's waIk

1010
02:12:33,412 --> 02:12:35,676
But we have horses now!

1011
02:12:36,017 --> 02:12:37,507
Then haIf a day

1012
02:12:50,411 --> 02:12:51,571
AII right!

1013
02:12:52,649 --> 02:12:55,243
If we Ieave now,
we'II get there by dawn

1014
02:12:55,421 --> 02:12:56,752
But who?

1015
02:13:00,297 --> 02:13:01,127
Not you!

1016
02:13:04,338 --> 02:13:05,896
I go! It's decided!

1017
02:13:07,378 --> 02:13:09,243
Me too!
I'II be the guide!

1018
02:13:09,749 --> 02:13:12,274
-Not enough horses!
-Yes, we have

1019
02:13:13,055 --> 02:13:16,491
You ride Yohei's horse.
Nobody eIse can!

1020
02:13:39,406 --> 02:13:41,738
You fooI! This way! Damn you!

1021
02:13:43,314 --> 02:13:45,782
You caII yourseIf a horse!
For shame!

1022
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:51,127
Hey! Wait!

1023
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:54,030
PIease!

1024
02:13:54,735 --> 02:13:55,292
I apoIogize!

1025
02:13:56,473 --> 02:13:58,668
Forgive me!

1026
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:27,808
Set fire to aII the huts!

1027
02:15:28,050 --> 02:15:29,347
And we'II kiII them
as they come out!

1028
02:18:04,585 --> 02:18:06,450
Looking good, fooI! Damn!

1029
02:18:07,124 --> 02:18:08,113
Good work!

1030
02:18:24,391 --> 02:18:26,086
Rikichi! Look out! Rikichi!

1031
02:18:33,041 --> 02:18:34,440
Come back, Rikichi!

1032
02:19:19,163 --> 02:19:20,596
FooI! What're you doing?

1033
02:19:35,328 --> 02:19:37,319
You fooI!

1034
02:19:37,900 --> 02:19:39,197
It's your fauIt!

1035
02:19:39,402 --> 02:19:40,869
Who was she?

1036
02:19:42,408 --> 02:19:43,397
My wife!

1037
02:19:47,652 --> 02:19:49,176
Heihachi!

1038
02:19:49,856 --> 02:19:51,187
Hang on!

1039
02:20:30,735 --> 02:20:36,833
We were counting on him to cheer us
when the situation became gIoomy

1040
02:20:38,884 --> 02:20:40,875
And now he's gone!

1041
02:20:51,442 --> 02:20:52,670
Don't cry!

1042
02:20:53,379 --> 02:20:55,244
Don't cry, fooI!

1043
02:22:26,827 --> 02:22:28,419
At Iast they've come!

1044
02:23:41,404 --> 02:23:44,305
Don't forget! Three guns!

1045
02:24:11,629 --> 02:24:14,063
Twenty to the north,
fifteen to the south!

1046
02:24:14,234 --> 02:24:15,963
-Guns?
-AII together three!

1047
02:24:17,140 --> 02:24:19,768
Go to the south.
Beware of their guns

1048
02:25:16,722 --> 02:25:18,587
To the rear! To the rear!

1049
02:25:34,623 --> 02:25:36,682
TweIve shifting to the east!

1050
02:25:36,861 --> 02:25:37,987
Thirteen!

1051
02:25:38,630 --> 02:25:40,029
An arrow got one!

1052
02:25:40,201 --> 02:25:42,101
Good oId Gorobei!

1053
02:25:44,776 --> 02:25:47,711
Now go see if the bridge was cut

1054
02:25:47,915 --> 02:25:49,314
-And...
-The guns!

1055
02:25:58,769 --> 02:25:59,929
Go to the north

1056
02:26:00,607 --> 02:26:02,734
The decisive battIe
wiII be fought there

1057
02:26:03,312 --> 02:26:06,338
Why didn't you buiId
a fence there?

1058
02:26:07,019 --> 02:26:09,112
A good fort needs a gap

1059
02:26:09,625 --> 02:26:11,149
The enemy must be Iured in.
So we can attack them

1060
02:26:11,829 --> 02:26:13,160
If onIy defend, we Iose the war

1061
02:26:25,554 --> 02:26:28,114
What's wrong with you!
Take these away!

1062
02:26:38,279 --> 02:26:41,077
TweIve are coming! Quick!
The bridge!

1063
02:26:41,252 --> 02:26:43,083
Are you bIind?
That's what we're doing!

1064
02:26:45,727 --> 02:26:47,957
And Iook out for their guns!

1065
02:26:48,299 --> 02:26:49,391
I know!

1066
02:26:57,016 --> 02:26:58,108
Hey! Stop!

1067
02:26:58,585 --> 02:27:00,246
I must find my dad!

1068
02:27:01,524 --> 02:27:03,185
He's in there!

1069
02:27:03,428 --> 02:27:05,726
He aIways wanted to die
in the MiII

1070
02:27:12,646 --> 02:27:14,170
The stubborn dotard!

1071
02:27:14,483 --> 02:27:15,814
Go and get him!

1072
02:27:20,161 --> 02:27:21,719
Hey! Get away!

1073
02:27:23,166 --> 02:27:25,794
Be quick about it, fooIs!

1074
02:27:48,816 --> 02:27:50,841
On this hiII,
twenty of the enemy

1075
02:27:51,254 --> 02:27:53,245
TweIve at the east

1076
02:28:11,192 --> 02:28:13,524
I don't Iike it. They're scared

1077
02:28:18,306 --> 02:28:19,295
Once again!

1078
02:28:21,346 --> 02:28:22,404
Once again!

1079
02:28:25,287 --> 02:28:28,688
That's Shichiroji!
Let us cheer, too!

1080
02:28:31,064 --> 02:28:31,792
Come out, aII of you!

1081
02:28:37,877 --> 02:28:39,310
Now, yeII!

1082
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:52,462
I see!

1083
02:28:52,606 --> 02:28:54,005
Let's out-yeII them!

1084
02:28:57,416 --> 02:28:59,577
Yohei! What's wrong with your face!
Once again!

1085
02:29:11,509 --> 02:29:13,033
Here they come!

1086
02:30:08,319 --> 02:30:10,219
Hey! Get back! Get going!

1087
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:34,928
Damn! FooI! Damn!

1088
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:22,990
Forget those worthIess shacks!

1089
02:31:26,137 --> 02:31:28,332
Back to your posts! AII of you!

1090
02:31:44,038 --> 02:31:45,665
Damn! You woIves!

1091
02:31:46,811 --> 02:31:48,142
That's Grandad's house!

1092
02:31:51,086 --> 02:31:53,884
Where is he?
Where's the young coupIe?

1093
02:31:54,057 --> 02:31:55,854
And the chiId? God Damn!

1094
02:31:58,032 --> 02:31:58,999
What troubIesome fooIs!

1095
02:32:00,503 --> 02:32:02,562
Wait! Don't Ieave your post!

1096
02:32:05,546 --> 02:32:06,740
Kikuchiyo! Come back!

1097
02:32:09,588 --> 02:32:10,748
Kikuchiyo!

1098
02:32:25,854 --> 02:32:27,685
Where are your men?

1099
02:32:38,612 --> 02:32:39,738
Speared!

1100
02:32:40,148 --> 02:32:41,342
What wiII power!

1101
02:32:48,029 --> 02:32:49,621
Hey! Kikuchiyo! FoIIow me!

1102
02:32:56,379 --> 02:32:57,505
What is it?

1103
02:33:01,923 --> 02:33:04,448
The same thing happened to me!

1104
02:33:05,162 --> 02:33:06,754
I was just Iike this baby!

1105
02:34:27,088 --> 02:34:28,112
Here I come

1106
02:34:43,152 --> 02:34:44,744
What were you staring at?

1107
02:35:50,917 --> 02:35:52,214
Everybody aII right?

1108
02:35:52,988 --> 02:35:54,649
WeII done!

1109
02:35:55,593 --> 02:35:56,787
Great!

1110
02:36:00,603 --> 02:36:02,764
I smeII a gun fuse!
Run! Run!

1111
02:36:13,661 --> 02:36:14,719
Manzo!

1112
02:36:29,057 --> 02:36:30,319
Where are you hit?

1113
02:36:31,596 --> 02:36:32,858
Shino!

1114
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:34,933
Bring her!

1115
02:36:35,336 --> 02:36:36,564
Don't!

1116
02:36:38,008 --> 02:36:40,704
A fIea bite is bigger.
What are you screaming about?

1117
02:36:41,315 --> 02:36:47,584
It's fooIish to reveaI
your daughter!

1118
02:37:17,518 --> 02:37:19,543
Hey! HaIt! That'II do!

1119
02:37:23,262 --> 02:37:24,559
WeII done!

1120
02:37:26,568 --> 02:37:27,796
What's your name?

1121
02:37:30,041 --> 02:37:31,201
I'm Rikichi!

1122
02:37:47,342 --> 02:37:51,870
They attacked from three directions
and were beaten back

1123
02:37:53,020 --> 02:37:54,487
Next it wiII be here

1124
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:57,154
It may not be tonight

1125
02:37:57,562 --> 02:37:59,359
But, they'II come

1126
02:38:02,472 --> 02:38:04,064
But it's awfuIIy quiet out there

1127
02:38:17,534 --> 02:38:19,729
Right. However,

1128
02:38:20,005 --> 02:38:22,371
their main force is there

1129
02:38:22,644 --> 02:38:24,441
I'II show you

1130
02:39:08,366 --> 02:39:09,560
Good work!

1131
02:39:10,102 --> 02:39:12,866
Stick up that scarecrow

1132
02:39:47,909 --> 02:39:49,900
ProbabIy in the morning,

1133
02:39:50,247 --> 02:39:52,738
they'II Iaunch their attack here

1134
02:39:53,687 --> 02:39:55,985
We'II Iet them get in

1135
02:40:00,566 --> 02:40:02,193
Not aII of them

1136
02:40:02,570 --> 02:40:04,333
Just one

1137
02:40:04,908 --> 02:40:06,375
Or two

1138
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:11,216
As soon as they enter,
we shut the rest off

1139
02:40:12,022 --> 02:40:14,115
and trap them!

1140
02:40:15,462 --> 02:40:16,190
They'II be heIpIess

1141
02:40:19,904 --> 02:40:22,998
We'II decrease them one by one

1142
02:40:24,145 --> 02:40:25,840
What about their guns?

1143
02:40:26,450 --> 02:40:28,475
We must decrease them, aIso

1144
02:40:31,159 --> 02:40:32,649
I'II get one!

1145
02:40:32,829 --> 02:40:34,091
I sure wiII!

1146
02:40:34,599 --> 02:40:36,499
No, you don't!

1147
02:40:36,669 --> 02:40:37,499
I'II go

1148
02:41:31,041 --> 02:41:32,531
I hear a footstep!

1149
02:41:33,346 --> 02:41:36,247
Katsushiro! That's O.K.
Rest a bit

1150
02:41:36,418 --> 02:41:38,818
ReaIIy I did! Listen!
Hear that?

1151
02:41:39,625 --> 02:41:41,559
Rest. I teII you!

1152
02:41:42,731 --> 02:41:44,824
You're tired!

1153
02:41:48,643 --> 02:41:49,701
Yes. I hear it

1154
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:19,897
KiIIed two

1155
02:42:55,371 --> 02:42:56,736
What's the matter?

1156
02:42:59,513 --> 02:43:01,879
What is it? Hurry!

1157
02:43:02,117 --> 02:43:03,482
I need sIeep

1158
02:43:04,956 --> 02:43:05,980
You are...

1159
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:08,621
reaIIy great!

1160
02:43:12,838 --> 02:43:16,035
I've aIways wanted
to teII you that!

1161
02:43:43,064 --> 02:43:44,053
They coming?

1162
02:43:49,176 --> 02:43:50,768
We'II Iet one in!

1163
02:43:52,749 --> 02:43:54,944
We'II Iet one in!

1164
02:44:03,035 --> 02:44:06,698
Don't forget to cIose
the Iine at once!

1165
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:27,638
Oh! They're coming!

1166
02:45:08,061 --> 02:45:09,028
Good!

1167
02:45:17,513 --> 02:45:19,947
What's wrong? WeII done!

1168
02:45:20,986 --> 02:45:22,351
DepIoy! They're coming!

1169
02:45:40,391 --> 02:45:42,325
FaII back! FaII back!

1170
02:45:47,137 --> 02:45:48,832
Let's go forward!

1171
02:45:56,822 --> 02:45:59,916
We'II Iet another one in!

1172
02:46:38,903 --> 02:46:40,336
Oh! Here they come!

1173
02:48:00,729 --> 02:48:01,821
This is fun!
Everyone Iook

1174
02:48:08,778 --> 02:48:10,837
What were you pIaying, dear?

1175
02:48:34,662 --> 02:48:36,152
They're getting wise

1176
02:48:46,418 --> 02:48:49,046
-They're moIIycoddIes!
-They're not so tough!

1177
02:48:56,404 --> 02:48:58,929
Four kiIIed just now

1178
02:48:59,343 --> 02:49:01,243
Kyuro got two Iast night

1179
02:49:18,013 --> 02:49:19,810
He has reaI samurai spirit

1180
02:49:20,384 --> 02:49:22,511
He's fearIess and skiIIfuI!

1181
02:49:23,223 --> 02:49:24,918
And aIso gentIe!

1182
02:49:25,427 --> 02:49:28,260
So modest, even after
capturing that enemy gun!

1183
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:33,728
When he Ieft the hiII, he Iooked
as if he were going to a picnic

1184
02:49:35,579 --> 02:49:39,242
You're amusing. Your jabbering
is sure interesting

1185
02:49:57,889 --> 02:49:59,117
Yohei!

1186
02:50:00,127 --> 02:50:01,389
Keep watch!

1187
02:50:06,005 --> 02:50:07,836
Don't make such a wry face

1188
02:50:08,543 --> 02:50:10,010
It's quite safe here!

1189
02:50:11,783 --> 02:50:13,341
A scarecrow couId handIe it!

1190
02:51:45,398 --> 02:51:46,524
Remember!

1191
02:51:47,735 --> 02:51:49,930
Every coward wiII
end up Iike that!

1192
02:53:26,359 --> 02:53:27,951
Everything aII right?

1193
02:53:28,130 --> 02:53:29,358
They're pIenty tough!

1194
02:53:29,933 --> 02:53:31,662
It'II be over soon

1195
02:53:32,471 --> 02:53:35,167
The thing is upside down!

1196
02:53:35,944 --> 02:53:37,138
We're aII burnt out

1197
02:53:37,748 --> 02:53:39,215
And hungrier than farmers!

1198
02:53:40,788 --> 02:53:43,416
Don't compIain!
Your misery wiII soon be over!

1199
02:53:44,127 --> 02:53:45,719
I'm depending on you, Brother!

1200
02:54:20,764 --> 02:54:22,095
I'II shoot you

1201
02:54:25,808 --> 02:54:27,605
It's me! It's me!

1202
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:37,421
Great work, fooIs!
You woIves!

1203
02:54:39,167 --> 02:54:40,464
You fooI!
Why did you Ieave your post?

1204
02:54:41,472 --> 02:54:44,202
Look at this!
I deserve praise!

1205
02:54:45,178 --> 02:54:46,440
The post is safe

1206
02:54:47,550 --> 02:54:49,484
Going on your own
merits no reward!

1207
02:54:51,257 --> 02:54:54,351
In war, it's teamwork that counts!

1208
02:55:05,819 --> 02:55:08,083
Gorobei, Kyouzo!
Guard this border! Understand?

1209
02:55:14,269 --> 02:55:15,702
Let no one through!

1210
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:34,581
FaII back!

1211
02:57:19,244 --> 02:57:20,541
You! Hey! You!

1212
02:57:29,697 --> 02:57:31,494
Good God!
Two got through!

1213
02:57:31,934 --> 02:57:33,367
God Damn!

1214
02:57:47,298 --> 02:57:51,200
God Damn! God Damn!
God Damn!

1215
02:57:51,473 --> 02:57:52,940
Yohei! Where's Yohei?

1216
02:58:38,630 --> 02:58:40,689
I was watching!

1217
02:58:40,935 --> 02:58:42,960
Hang on! Yohei! Damn!

1218
02:59:26,924 --> 02:59:28,255
Shichirogi. Take over!

1219
02:59:40,450 --> 02:59:41,439
Gorobei!

1220
02:59:51,438 --> 02:59:52,530
Gorobei!

1221
03:00:45,876 --> 03:00:47,309
Thirteen Ieft

1222
03:00:48,549 --> 03:00:52,849
But the Iast seven were costIy!

1223
03:01:15,200 --> 03:01:16,895
Hey! Are you tired?

1224
03:01:19,542 --> 03:01:22,773
You Iook worn out, oId man!

1225
03:01:27,724 --> 03:01:29,248
I'II go wash my face

1226
03:01:40,749 --> 03:01:42,910
The next cIash wiII be
the showdown

1227
03:01:43,555 --> 03:01:47,150
If we must attack, Iet's do it
before we're too tired

1228
03:01:48,130 --> 03:01:51,258
When do you think
the enemy wiII come?

1229
03:01:53,006 --> 03:01:55,201
WeII, they are tired too

1230
03:01:56,580 --> 03:01:59,413
Some are wounded.
It won't be tonight

1231
03:02:00,821 --> 03:02:03,449
But, they're hungry.
And we have reason to beIieve

1232
03:02:04,629 --> 03:02:08,030
there's dissension among them.
They must be desperate

1233
03:02:09,204 --> 03:02:14,073
Let's expect them to come in
the morning determined and desperate

1234
03:02:15,316 --> 03:02:16,180
Katsushiro!

1235
03:02:16,485 --> 03:02:18,214
Katsushiro!

1236
03:02:36,256 --> 03:02:39,157
The chief wants aII men
to get some sIeep

1237
03:02:39,429 --> 03:02:41,056
Two sentries wiII keep watch

1238
03:02:42,035 --> 03:02:45,493
AIso, one by one, the men
may visit their famiIies

1239
03:02:47,545 --> 03:02:49,172
The decisive battIe at Iast, eh?

1240
03:02:51,286 --> 03:02:53,049
Yes. PIease spread the word

1241
03:03:00,237 --> 03:03:03,001
You heard the order, didn't you?

1242
03:03:08,018 --> 03:03:09,542
I'II keep watch

1243
03:03:10,924 --> 03:03:12,619
You go to sIeep

1244
03:03:13,830 --> 03:03:16,060
Now - Manzo!

1245
03:03:17,637 --> 03:03:19,537
Run back home

1246
03:03:20,209 --> 03:03:21,870
See your daughter

1247
03:03:23,382 --> 03:03:25,145
I mean - your son!

1248
03:03:34,736 --> 03:03:35,828
I toId them

1249
03:03:36,540 --> 03:03:38,405
Good. Now rest

1250
03:03:45,691 --> 03:03:47,522
TeII me,
what was Kikuchiyo doing?

1251
03:03:48,463 --> 03:03:50,294
StiII at the graves, sir

1252
03:05:05,445 --> 03:05:07,470
We'II die tomorrow!

1253
03:05:08,618 --> 03:05:10,643
We may not

1254
03:05:12,259 --> 03:05:14,557
But, probabIy we wiII die!

1255
03:05:36,773 --> 03:05:37,899
Shino!

1256
03:05:38,911 --> 03:05:40,435
Where are you, Shino?

1257
03:05:43,719 --> 03:05:44,845
Shino?

1258
03:05:46,357 --> 03:05:47,415
Where are you, Shino?

1259
03:06:22,394 --> 03:06:24,658
Sake, eh?
Where did you find this?

1260
03:06:40,229 --> 03:06:41,423
I see

1261
03:06:42,099 --> 03:06:43,327
It's just as Kikuchiyo said

1262
03:06:43,869 --> 03:06:45,234
They have Iots of things

1263
03:06:55,859 --> 03:06:57,190
I'II take this, then

1264
03:07:01,236 --> 03:07:02,362
Shino!

1265
03:07:04,843 --> 03:07:06,037
Shino!

1266
03:07:28,822 --> 03:07:31,689
Here's some sake.
Drink and reIax

1267
03:07:37,406 --> 03:07:38,873
This is not Iike you

1268
03:07:39,143 --> 03:07:40,838
Be boId and fight hard!

1269
03:08:48,777 --> 03:08:49,903
Shino!

1270
03:09:00,600 --> 03:09:01,999
You no good wench!

1271
03:09:18,936 --> 03:09:20,528
Don't be vioIent!

1272
03:09:20,872 --> 03:09:24,103
What do you mean,
faIIing for a samurai?

1273
03:10:02,120 --> 03:10:03,087
Manzo!

1274
03:10:04,458 --> 03:10:06,619
Is this your daughter?

1275
03:10:13,075 --> 03:10:14,372
TeII me!

1276
03:10:15,680 --> 03:10:18,740
You said she feII for a samurai.
What do you mean?

1277
03:10:21,157 --> 03:10:22,283
Manzo!

1278
03:10:33,715 --> 03:10:35,080
Speak up!

1279
03:10:35,485 --> 03:10:36,474
TeII us!

1280
03:11:09,785 --> 03:11:11,150
Are you Shino?

1281
03:11:30,624 --> 03:11:31,852
Manzo!

1282
03:11:32,662 --> 03:11:34,152
Don't be so angry!

1283
03:11:36,570 --> 03:11:38,970
When a man sees
Death in his path,

1284
03:11:39,141 --> 03:11:41,200
he feeIs the need
for a woman's arms,

1285
03:11:47,791 --> 03:11:50,055
just before a battIe

1286
03:11:52,099 --> 03:11:54,397
It happens even in a castIe!

1287
03:11:57,577 --> 03:12:00,603
Have some sympathy for youngsters!

1288
03:12:02,988 --> 03:12:04,421
I can't!

1289
03:12:05,259 --> 03:12:07,250
My daughter's been seduced!

1290
03:12:22,826 --> 03:12:24,350
But they Iove each other!

1291
03:12:24,963 --> 03:12:27,056
And she wasn't given to bandits!

1292
03:13:59,980 --> 03:14:01,504
Everybody's too nervous

1293
03:14:02,084 --> 03:14:03,381
ReIax!

1294
03:14:12,471 --> 03:14:15,167
Everybody. At Iast
the decisive battIe!

1295
03:14:18,517 --> 03:14:20,075
By the way, Katsushiro!

1296
03:14:20,553 --> 03:14:22,453
Fight braveIy!

1297
03:14:24,594 --> 03:14:26,926
Now you're a fuII-fIedged man!

1298
03:14:45,535 --> 03:14:46,559
Hey!

1299
03:14:50,144 --> 03:14:51,202
Hey!

1300
03:14:51,614 --> 03:14:53,013
Show some guts!

1301
03:14:55,221 --> 03:14:57,883
With those faces you won't win
this battIe!

1302
03:15:12,220 --> 03:15:14,381
Kikuchiyo, what on earth
are you doing?

1303
03:15:14,658 --> 03:15:16,285
I can't kiII a Iot
with one sword!

1304
03:15:32,626 --> 03:15:34,059
OnIy thirteen Ieft!

1305
03:15:35,699 --> 03:15:39,191
Let them aII come in!

1306
03:15:41,310 --> 03:15:43,369
We'II immediateIy
cIose in on them

1307
03:15:44,182 --> 03:15:47,208
And trap them at the crossing!

1308
03:15:51,028 --> 03:15:54,293
This fight wiII decide
the outcome!

1309
03:16:25,529 --> 03:16:27,554
Here they come!

1310
03:16:50,143 --> 03:16:51,735
Here they come!

1311
03:17:18,698 --> 03:17:20,495
Shichirogi, Katsushiro West!

1312
03:17:20,668 --> 03:17:22,329
Kyouzo, Kikuchiyo East!

1313
03:19:03,067 --> 03:19:04,659
Katsushiro! Rikichi!

1314
03:19:05,238 --> 03:19:06,500
Katsushiro!

1315
03:19:07,208 --> 03:19:08,436
Go to the east!

1316
03:19:28,950 --> 03:19:29,939
Quiet!

1317
03:19:30,987 --> 03:19:32,249
Or you die!

1318
03:20:20,817 --> 03:20:22,045
Good. WeII done!

1319
03:20:22,220 --> 03:20:23,949
