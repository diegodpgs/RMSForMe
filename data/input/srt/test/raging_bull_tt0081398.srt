1
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:59,306
I remember those cheers...

2
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:01,504
they still ring in my ears,

3
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,447
and for years
they remain in my thoughts,

4
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,881
'cause one night,

5
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,044
I took off my robe,
and what'd I do?

6
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,281
I forgot to wear shorts.

7
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,958
I recall every fall,
every hook, every jab,

8
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:19,225
the worst way a guy
can get rid of his flab,

9
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,629
as you know,
my life wasn't drab.

10
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,469
Though I'd much...

11
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:27,802
Though I'd rather hear you cheer 
when you delve--

12
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,876
Though I'd rather hear you cheer
when I delve into Shakespeare...

13
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,740
"A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!"

14
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,814
I haven't had a winner in six months.

15
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,454
And though I'm no Olivier,
I would much rather...

16
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:48,152
And though I'm no Olivier,
if he fought Sugar Ray,

17
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,093
he would say that the thing
ain't the ring, it's the play.

18
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,598
So, give me a stage 
where this bull here can rage,

19
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,669
and though I can fight,
I'd much rather recite.

20
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:00,328
That's entertainment.

21
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,378
That's entertainment.

22
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,107
<i>Jake La Motta and Jimmy Reeves</i>

23
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,682
<i>in the Cleveland Arena.</i>

24
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,809
<i>La Motta is undefeated,
but he's well behind on points.</i>

25
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,013
<i>The Bronx Bull has taken
a lot of punishment in this bout.</i>

26
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,388
<i>Jake is cut around the left eye.
Jimmy Reeves has outboxed him...</i>

27
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,792
Jack, tell me, why the fuck 
do we have to come to Cleveland for you

28
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,022
to get beaten by a <i>mulignane</i>?

29
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,031
Come on, do the fuckin' right thing.

30
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,294
He's got you by the balls,
you're outpointed.

31
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:32,029
You're comin' up for the tenth,
you're gonna have to knock him out.

32
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,299
I want you to bite him, kick him,
do anything you gotta do.

33
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:36,237
Nobody's lookin',
you know what to do.

34
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,310
Just like home--
all over the fuckin' moolies.

35
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,208
Knock the motherfucker out.
You understand? Knock him out.

36
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:43,577
Hey, you wanna go in there?
You wanna go in and do it?

37
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,746
Help!

38
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,320
We need a knockout,
let's go get a knockout,

39
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:53,391
that's where it's at.

40
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:56,188
Tenth and final round.
Good luck to you both.

<i>La Motta fighting out of a half crouch.</i>

42

<i>Reeves is up against a tough fighter,</i>

43
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,501
<i>a man who doesn't know how to back up.</i>

44
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:06,162
<i>La Motta continues to bore in,
out of the bob and weave,</i>

<i>hooks a left hand to the jaw,
and Reeves is down!</i>

46

<i>The crowd is urging Jake on.</i>

47

<i>The referee is tolling over Reeves.
He's got to get up.</i>

<i>La Motta comes at him once again,
Reeves misses a right,</i>

49

<i>takes a left, and another left,
a hard left hand to the jaw,</i>

50

<i>and Reeves is down for the second time.</i>

59

four... five...

66
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,462
Jack, Jack, come here.

67
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:08,431
It's no good.
This is Ohio, not New York!

68
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,866
- You waited too long!
- That dumb bastard!

69
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,837
Put the robe on right, huh?
Put my robe on right!

70

Jake won that fight!

Don't leave. Don't get outta

00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,841
You won-- let him go first.
Stay in, I'm tellin' you.

80
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,640
<i>La Motta floored Reeves

Help!

84
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,655
...on his fuckin' back,
they pick up his arm, he's dead. 

85
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,257
They tell him he won the fight.
People went crazy.

86
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,304
That shit woulda never happened 
if Tommy was there takin' care of it.

87
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:56,636
He's gotta be with Tommy to fight
in New York, to get a title shot.

88
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,676
He's gonna wind up punch-drunk, 
your brother.

89
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,005
- I know.
- You know.

90
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,570
You gotta make him understand 
it's the best thing for everybody involved.

91
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,582
- I said I know.
- You know,

92
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:08,312
but you gotta make him know,
make him understand it.

93
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,751
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop?

94
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,755
When the fuck you gonna stop 
with that stuff?

95
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,688
I told ya,
I understand everything.

96
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,760
He just wants to do things for himself.

97
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:17,761
- Hard to understand?
- It's because he's got a head

98
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,763
- like concrete.
- You make me laugh.

99
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,958
You think it's easy?
Why don't you talk to him?

100
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,864
- You know what to say.
- You know I can't talk to him.

101
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,869
- Why can't you talk to him?
- 'Cause he don't like me.

102
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,632
Nobody likes you,
you oughta be used to it.

103
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,701
They knew.

104
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,243
They knew who was the boss.

105
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,710
The judges didn't know. 
Who knows what happened with them?

106
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:41,617
The people knew.

107
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:46,054
You don't believe me, you thought
I was over there foolin' around, huh?

108
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,127
You thought I was foolin' around, 
didn't ya? Tell me the truth.

109
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,162
I ain't doin' no foolin' around.

110
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:54,426
- That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

111
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,991
That championship belt on me,
that's when I fool around.

112
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,064
Is it done?

113
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,539
No, it's not done.

114
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:07,339
Don't overcook it.
You overcook it, it's no good.

115
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,574
It defeats its own purpose.

116
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,414
What are you doin'?
I just said don't overcook it.

117
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,582
You're overcookin' it,
bring it over.

118
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,750
- You want your steak?
- Bring it over.

119
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,985
Bring it over!

120
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,190
It's like a piece of charcoal!
Bring it over here!

121
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,699
- You want your steak?
- Yeah, right now!

122
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,464
Good.
There's your stupid steak.

123
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:35,039
- Can't wait for it to be done?
- No, I can't wait.

124
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,131
Good. Okay? Happy?

125
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,800
- Happy?
- That's all I want.

126
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,776
That's-- there, no, more. There.

127
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,477
Botherin' me about a steak, huh?
You're botherin' me about a steak?!

128
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,552
I agree with you.
He should be with Tommy.

129
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,486
If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him.
What the fuck you want me to do?

130
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,386
Tommy tells me every day to talk to you

131
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,981
and speak to Jake
to straighten this thing out,

132
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,617
I'm gonna wind up in the middle.

133
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,024
You're in the middle?
I'm his brother.

134
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,324
- He's got me fuckin' nuts.
- You're his brother.

135
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,797
If you can't talk to him,
who's gonna talk to him?

136
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,402
- I'll talk to him.
- Do what you can, that's all.

137
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,233
- That's all I'm askin' you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:09,637
- Let me go up.
- All right? Where you gonna be?

139
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,732
I'll be at the gym or the other joint, 
one of the two.

140
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,744
- I'll catch you by the gym.
- All right. Sal?

141
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:14,835
Yeah?

142
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,743
Complain some more, I wanna hear.

143
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,753
- Complain? You call those carrots?
- That's right.

144
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,686
- You call that food?
- You ate 'em. Did you eat them?

145
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,485
You call that food?
I got no choice!

146
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,287
- I'm sick of you already!
- I got no choice!

147
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:32,261
- I can't believe you!
- I got no choice!

148
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,924
You got no choice?
Get away from me!

149
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:37,331
- Please!
- Get in there. Get in there!

150
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,030
Get your hands off me,
get away from me!

151
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,039
Fuck! I'm sick of you!

152
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,166
What's the matter with you,
you animals?

153
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,834
- What?!
- Jack, come on!

154
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:47,935
- You animals!
- Come on, huh?

155
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:50,173
This son of a bitch
is callin' me an animal.

156
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,682
- Hey, you!
- Come on, Jack.

157
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:55,446
I'm gonna get hold of that dog,
and I'm gonna eat it for lunch!

158
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,988
You hear what I'm sayin'?
You hear me, Larry?

159
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,287
- Larry?
- Crazy animal!

160
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:03,861
Who's an animal?
Your mother's an animal!

161
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,827
You son of a bitch!

162
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,991
You're gonna find your dog dead
in the hallway tomorrow, ya bum.

163
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,568
- I can't take it!
- The whole block,

164
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,728
- people could hear you.
- I'll kill the whole family.

165
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,396
- Sit down, relax.
- I can't take this anymore!

166
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,406
You break anything in there, 
I'm gonna kill ya!

167
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:19,306
I swear to God, 
I'm gonna come in there and kill ya.

168
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:20,878
Yeah, sure.

169
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,146
You wanna calm down?

170
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,153
Oh, fuck!

171
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,314
What'd I do?

172
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:34,492
Come on, honey, let's be friends.

173
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,992
- Truce, all right?
- It's not all right!

174
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,597
You can't, I'm telling you--

175
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,463
you can't fuckin' eat
and drink like an animal,

176
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,833
put up with this fuckin' <i>brasciole</i> here.

177
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,202
You can't do this.
I'm tellin' ya.

178
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,073
Forget about the Reeves thing,
you got a million other fights comin' up.

179
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,145
You just can't keep doin' this.

180
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:56,873
What's wrong?

181
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,179
Something's the matter, what's up?

182
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:11,659
You know what's botherin' me?

183
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:14,624
My hands.

184
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,298
Your hands?
What about 'em?

185
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,801
I got these small hands.
I got a little girl's hands.

186
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,036
I got 'em, too.
What's the difference?

187
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,647
Know what that means?

188
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:32,908
No matter how big I get,
no matter who I fight,

189
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,476
no matter what I do,
I ain't never gonna fight Joe Louis.

190
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,820
That's right, he's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

191
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:43,289
I ain't never gonna get a chance
to fight the best there is.

192
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,159
And you know somethin'?
I'm better than them.

193
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,199
I ain't never gonna get a chance.

194
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,496
You're asking me what's wrong.

195
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,873
You're crazy to even think 
about somethin' like that.

196
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:00,001
He's a fuckin' heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

197
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,878
It's impossible, it'll never happen,
so why go crazy thinkin' about it?

198
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:05,108
It's not normal.

199
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:10,951
Do me a favor.

200
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,854
- Yeah, what?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

201
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,424
- What?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

202
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,427
Forget about it.

203
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:21,658
I want you to hit me in the face, 
go ahead.

204
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,759
- Take your best shot.
- Forget about it, I ain't doin' it.

205
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,304
We have fights all the time--
are you worried now?

206
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,532
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead.

207
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,971
- No.
- What, are you afraid?

208
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,064
Afraid of what?

209
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:33,474
Come on, don't be a little faggot, 
hit me.

210
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,414
- I ain't a fag.
- Take your best shot, go ahead.

211
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,747
Come on. You gotta be a real jerk,
you want me to punch you in the face.

212
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,921
Did I not tell you just to do it?
Now I'm tellin' you, you gotta do it.

213
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,484
I ain't hittin' ya.

214
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:50,493
I'm your older brother, Joey.
I'm tellin' ya somethin'.

215
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,392
I know what you said.
I ain't doin' it.

216
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,167
I don't care if you get mad,
I ain't doin' it.

217
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,836
Fuckin' nut.

218
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,765
I'm not doin' it,
I'm not gonna do it.

219
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:06,569
I don't have any gloves. 
What am I gonna hit you with, the table?

220
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,373
- I ain't doin' it.
- Use that over there.

221
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,608
- What?
- That's right, use that.

222
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,949
Wrap it around your hand!
How many times I gotta tell you?

223
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:17,783
- Not too many more.
- Go ahead.

224
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:19,186
- You want me to hit you?
- I want you to hit me

225
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,385
with everything you got. 
I want you to fuckin' lay me out, go ahead.

226
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,461
- You sure?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,824
- Go ahead.
- All right.

228
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,023
- Harder.
- Yeah?

229
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,794
You throw a punch like you 
take it up the ass, come on.

230
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,562
Harder, harder.

231
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,467
- Harder.
- That's hard, you fuck.

232
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,834
- What do you want?
- Take it off.

233
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,339
- Take it off.
- Come on, you wanna stop now?

234
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:38,704
- That's enough with that--
- Take it off.

235
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,936
Come on.

236
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,171
- Come on.
- Don't fuck around.

237
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,871
- What are you, a girl?
- Oh, girl, huh?

238
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:44,608
I'm gonna smack you again,
throw it again.

239
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:45,808
- That's enough.
- Go ahead.

240
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,714
- I said that's enough!
- Harder, harder.

241
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,481
No, your fuckin' cuts
are opening and everything.

242
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:53,115
What are you tryin' to prove?
What does it prove?

243
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,736
Hey, Vito.

244
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,280
Joey, what's what?

245
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,615
Jake, you're lookin' good.

246
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,184
How you doin'?

247
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:29,923
Don't stay here.

248
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:31,988
Joey.

249
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:33,990
Come here.

250
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,200
Yeah, he looks mad, huh?

251
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,498
Looks mad.

252
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:43,039
Spoke to him yesterday,
I don't know.

253
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,075
You told 'em to come up here?

254
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,437
Answer me when I talk to you.

255
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,343
Yeah, why?
I can't have my friends up here?

256
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,643
- I heard this fucker didn't win the fight.
- Take it easy.

257
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,844
Don't ever bring 'em up here again, 
hear me?

258
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:55,920
Hear me? Come on.

259
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,158
- Come on!
- They look like two fags over there.

260
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:19,269
We're gonna go,
I'll call you tomorrow, huh?

261
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,708
Hey, Jake, 
watch you don't hurt yourself.

262
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,546
How's your wife?
Is everything okay?

263
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:32,054
Anybody bothers you,
let me know, okay?

264
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,022
Yeah. Yeah, wave.
They're your friends.

265
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,253
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
You gotta make a fuckin' jerk outta me.

266
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:40,490
They only came up here 'cause Tommy
told 'em to come up to try to help us.

267
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,534
What's the matter with you, help who?
What's the matter with you?

268
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,297
How they gonna help me?
What, by takin' my money?

269
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,399
Is that what youse talkin' about,
takin' my money?

270
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,602
I'm here breakin' my ass, not them.

271
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,609
Don't ever bring 'em up here again,

272
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,772
What are ya, a jerk there?

273
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,442
I'm a jerk?
You're a fuckin' asshole.

274
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,917

276
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,919
Maybe you can't, huh?

277
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:14,365
Ya fuck!

278
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,448
Come on, give me a Coke.

279
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,381
Hey, shove off.
You gonna go to the dance?

280
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,049
Go to the dance?

281
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,765
- Who's that girl over there?
- The one I was talkin' to?

282
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,834
- Yeah.
- The blonde?

283
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,402
- Yeah.
- Vickie, you mean.

284
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,473
- Where's she from?
- She's from the neighborhood,

285
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,635
she's a neighborhood girl.

286
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,678
What's her last name?

287
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,272
Vickie, that's all I know.
They call her Vickie.

288
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,645
She knows them?

289
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,723
She knows them, they know her,
she comes to the pool every day.

290
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:15,486
Everybody knows each other--
you know how that shit works.

291
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,721
- She go with them?
- She don't go with nobody.

292
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:20,195
She's 15 years old,
where the fuck's she gonna go?

293
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,061
Where ya gonna take her,
the Copacabana?

294
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,262
I heard there was a girl 
that he went with

295
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,429
that was a very beautiful
young girl, blonde.

296
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,271
- Yeah?
- It's not her?

297
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,072
I doubt it very much.

298
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,408
What are you thinkin' about, anyway?

299
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:37,947
She ain't the kinda girl
you just fuck and forget about.

300
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,539
Joey, how many times 
I gotta tell ya?

301
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,176
Why are you always cursin'
when I'm talkin' to you?

302
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,120
Don't do it around me.
Do it around your friends.

303
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:47,851
- It's that thing, just don't do it.
- All right, she's--

304
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:50,928
The kinda girl you bang and forget about-- 
she's not like that.

305
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,623
You gotta spend time with her, 
get involved.

306
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,960
You know, it's...

307
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,299
Did you bang her?

308
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,462
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

309
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,006
I just told you the truth.
I tell you the truth the first time,

310
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,076
you don't have to ask me again,
I never do that.

311
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:08,270
I always tell you the truth.
If I did it, you would know.

312
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,711
I took her out a couple of times.

313
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,182
You went with her?
You didn't try to fuck her?

314
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:16,344
I try to fuck anything,
you know that.

315
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:18,752
- She didn't go with you?
- No, she didn't go for it.

316
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,518
- Naturally.
- Naturally?

317
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,855
- She knew better.
- What do you mean, she knew better?

318
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:24,619
She knew you were an animal,

319
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:26,697
she knew it was no good
if you'd go with her.

320
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,595
Her reputation would be ruined.

321
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:31,502
I thought he was talkin' to you, Vickie.

322
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,537
- That's--
- That's the same guy?

323
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:35,367
- Yeah, it's the same guy.
- I gotta break his legs.

324
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:36,462
He was over here yesterday.

325
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:37,871
- He was here yesterday?
- You missed him.

326
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,376
I was up to the house yesterday.
Didn't know he was over here.

327
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:42,776
- You stay in there, I'll go find him.
- No, I can catch him.

328
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,873
Your friends, they're in a huddle.
Big business meeting.

329
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,943
Come by the pool,
they sit around and talk.

330
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,648
Big deals.
They make sure she can hear.

331
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:56,191
Hey, like the big man.
Get the fuck outta here.

332
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,130
Where you goin', gettin' in the water?

333
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,595
Don't get your hair wet.

334
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:04,961
Big shot.

335
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:09,302
Get him alone in the back room,
smack him around, no more big shot--

336
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:10,704
without his gun.

337
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,641
Yeah, real tough guys.

338
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:19,483
- They're all tough guys.
- What are you thinkin' about?

339
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:23,145
Keep lookin'. Where the fuck you goin'?
You're dead, you're married.

340
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:27,156
You're a married man, it's all over.
Leave the young girls for me.

341
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:32,655
Big shot.

342
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,330
Let's get outta here.
You gonna stay here all night?

343
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:41,564
We'll never get through.

344
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:43,900
Where the hell do you think
you're goin' at this hour?

345
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:45,999
What are you, a cop?
I'm goin' out. Business.

346
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,170
Fuckin' worm.
You go out, I'm goin' out.

347
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,906
Do what you're gonna do,
what do I care?

348
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:50,981
Run out, see if I care.

349
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:52,845
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back!

350
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,077
Fuckin' bunch of guineas.

351
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:55,652
- You're always hangin' out together!
- Why don't you stop already?

352
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,779
Why don't you fuckin' stop?
You're not goin' on business.

353
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,119
- You're goin' to suck each other off!
- Why don't you have some respect?

354
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,455
- The whole buildin' hears ya.
- Suck him! Suck him, baby!

355
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,996
Hey, Larry! 
Now you got somethin' to talk about

356
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,463
with that fuckin' dog,
and this one up there.

357
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,693
Fuckin' Jew cunt, why don't you hit her 
in the head with a bat?

358
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,235
Don't call her no names,
she's still my wife.

359
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,100
- How much abuse you wanna take?
- I hit her enough.

360
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,797
- What am I supposed to do?
- Kill the fuck.

361
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,307
Go ahead!
Just leave me here like a dog!

362
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,207
You and your fuckin' ass--
you, too ya-- go out!

363
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:23,940
- What's the matter with you?!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

364
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:25,413
- You gotta leave me here?!
- You let the whole block hear you.

365
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,418
- What's the matter with you?!
- I could give a shit, ya fuckin' queer!

366
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,181
- Faggot! Go stick it up his ass!
- What'd you say?!

367
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:39,789
Oh! Beans!

368
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:42,992
Jack.

369
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,309
Beansy got a table in the back,
he said we could sit with them.

370
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:54,935
Beansy who?
Which Beansy?

371
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,707
- Huh?
- Beansy who?

372
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,442
Beans, you know,
he's one of the guys.

373
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,780
- You'll know him when you see him.
- She'll be over there?

374
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:03,285
I don't know, but you could see
from there, at least.

375
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,789
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't wanna look too hard.

376
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,058
- Hello, Joe, how you doin'?
- Beansy, what is it?

377
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:18,157
Thanks for the seats.

378
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:20,601
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey, what's up? Hey.

379
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:23,970
Nothing. I got trouble with these two
motherfuckin' greaseballs downstairs,

380
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:26,475
- they got me crazy.
- Hello, Father, how ya doin'?

381
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,910
- Hey, Father, what is it?
- Oh, ho, Father!

382
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:30,776
You wanna get laid?
You sure?

383
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,316
- You sure?
- Hey, no, no.

384
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,046
Father, where you goin'?
Bless the table, give us a shot.

385
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:38,881
Did you put money in the basket this week?

386
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,673
- You see her right there?
- I saw, I saw.

387
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,074
- Okay?
- I saw.

388
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:08,376
- They're goin' with her.
- Don't worry about them, go ahead.

389
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:09,453
Go ahead.

390
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,597
Get the fuck out,
you greaseball bastard!

391
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,170
Get out! Get out!

392
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:01,568
You, too, get out.

393
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,369
Get outta here, ya fuckin' bum, ya!

394
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:06,875
- Rotten bastards!
- Go back where you came from.

395
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,274
Hey, Vickie!

396
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:22,182
- Hi, Joey.
- How you doin'?

397
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:25,228
- I'm all right, what are you doin'?
- Nothin' much, what are you doin'?

398
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,424
- That your car?
- No, it's my brother's.

399
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,125
Did you ever meet my brother?

400
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:33,032
- No. Is that him?
- Yeah. Wanna meet him?

401
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:36,468
- All right.
- Hey, Jack!

402
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:39,969
There.

403
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,748
Vickie, this is my brother Jake.
He's gonna be the next champ.

404
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:52,982
Hi.

405
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:54,817
How you doin'?

406
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,488
Nice to meet you.

407
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:05,267
- Nice car.
- You like that car?

408
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,236
Yeah. It's nice.

409
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,441
Where you from?

410
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,077
Around here.

411
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,149
You wanna go for a ride?

412
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,959
All right. Gotta give me a few minutes,
I have to change, okay?

413
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,290
- All right?
- All right.

414
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,923
- I'll be back in a little while
- I'll be over there.

415
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,160
Okay.

416
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,636
Move over.

417
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,585
- I never played this game.
- Go ahead.

418
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:05,150
It's the only way you're gonna learn.
Here, I'll show you how to do it.

419
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,031
That's the way, that's right.

420
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,259
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

421
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,029
- Hit it?
- Just hit it nice.

422
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:13,535
Hit the middle one.

423
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,110
You see it?

424
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,147
No.

425
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:48,471
What does that mean?

426
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:51,474
It means the game is over.

427
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,807
Come on, let's go.

428
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,145
Daddy?

429
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,921
Dad?
Come on in.

430
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,894
Probably went shoppin' or somethin', 
let me see.

431
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:24,797
Yeah, he must have went shoppin'. 
Sit down.

432
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,615
- You want somethin' to eat?
- No.

433
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,513
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,459
<i>Salute.</i>

435
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,906
Why don't you sit over here?
Sit a little closer.

436
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,082
You're so far away, like you're
on the other side of the room.

437
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,167
Come here, come here.

438
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:32,242
Come here.
Sit over here.

439
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,106
Come on, come up from there.

440
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,041
That's better.

441
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:45,652
No, thank you anyway.

442
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,156
Some water?

443
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:01,334
Wanna see the rest of the place?

444
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:03,665
All right.

445
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:06,242
I bought it for my father.
I bought the building.

446
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,470
Oh, yeah?

447
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:11,911
- From fightin'?
- Yeah.

448
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,577
What else?

449
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:24,090
This is the dining room.

450
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,764
That's a bird.

451
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:30,333
It was a bird.
It's dead now, I think.

452
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:45,107
The restroom.

453
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:54,813
Sit down.

454
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:18,474
That's me and my brother.
We were foolin' around.

455
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:19,879
I know.

456
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,683
You look good, though.

457
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:30,660
What are you smilin' about?

458
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,655
I don't know.

459
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:41,000
You know how beautiful you are?

460
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,837
Anybody ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

461
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:46,705
Yeah, they tell you all the time.

462
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,748
<i>Sugar Ray Robinson
and Jake La Motta in Detroit</i>

463

<i>for their second fight.</i>

464
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,153
<i>The undefeated Sugar Ray defeated Jake</i>

465
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:32,814
<i>at Madison Square Garden last October.</i>

466
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,492
<i>You can see the contrast
in their styles--</i>

467
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,756
<i>the speedy Ray Robinson up on his toes, 
the dancing master.</i>

468
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,889
<i>La Motta the brawler moves 
in flat-footed most of the time.</i>

469
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,796
<i>Now he's hurt Robinson.</i>

470
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,161
<i>La Motta coming at Robinson again,</i>

471
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:49,364
<i>both hands to the head,

472
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:52,203
<i>A hard left hand to the body
thrown by La Motta.</i>

473
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:56,075
<i>Round 8, and it's anybody's fight
at this point. 10-rounder.</i>

474
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,240
<i>La Motta drives both hands to the head, 
hurts Robinson again.</i>

475
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,841
<i>Hooks the left hand to the jaw,
a right to the body.</i>

476
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,286
<i>Robinson comes back
with a right on the nose.</i>

477
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:07,516
<i>La Motta drives him across the ring, 
a left and a right to the head.</i>

478
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,526
<i>A hard left hand to the body,
and Robinson is driven out of the ring</i>

479
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,687
<i>for the first knockdown of his career.</i>

480
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,926
<i>This is the nearest
Robinson has been to a loss.</i>

481
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:29,744
<i>The fight nears its end.
La Motta has taken charge of the fight.</i>

482
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,146
<i>The undefeated Sugar Ray--
his winning ways are in jeopardy.</i>

483
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,378
<i>La Motta coming at him again.
La Motta, feigning a left hand.</i>

484
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,421
After ten rounds,

485
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:51,399
Judge Rossi, 8-2, La Motta.

491
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:11,815
<i>With this stunning victory,
La Motta broke what was considered</i>

492
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:14,857
<i>the impossible--
the invincible Sugar Ray's record.</i>

493
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,120
<i>La Motta has proved himself
a great fighter,</i>

494
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,753
<i>and he shouldn't be denied a shot
at the middleweight crown.</i>

495
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,800
You sure we should be doin' this?

496
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:28,729
Come here.

497
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,307
You said never to touch you
before a fight.

498
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:35,641
Come here,
before I give you a beatin'.

499
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:38,146
You said I couldn't.
You've been good for two weeks.

500
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,142
Come here.

501
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,654
Come here.

502
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:01,702
Touch my boo-boos.

503
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:10,138
"Boo-ba?"

504
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:13,114
Boo-boo.
Give the boo-boo a kiss.

505
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:15,114
Make it better.

506
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:32,658
Take off my pants.

507
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:35,968
You know how to take off my pants?

508
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,555
Now take off the rest.

509
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,629
You made me promise
not to get you excited.

510
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,856
Go ahead, do it.

511
00:35:18,148 --> 00:35:19,775
Take off your panties.

512
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,065
I like the gym smell.

513
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,423
What?

514
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,836
I like the smell of the gym.

515
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:45,627
No, no, no, no.
Enough, enough.

516
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:48,971
I can't do any more.
If I do any more, I'll sink it.

517
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,636
I gotta fight Robinson,
I can't fool around.

518
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,167
What are you doin'?

519
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:29,404
What are you doin'?
What are you doin' to me?

520
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:08,013
<i>Jake La Motta and Sugar Ray Robinson</i>

522
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:12,954
<i>These men are unique,
becoming classic rivals.</i>

523
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:15,684
<i>These two men--
fierce, powerful fighters,</i>

524
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,126
<i>dangerous-- so much so that
no other fighter will go near them.</i>

525
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:22,164
<i>And so, they fight each other,
three weeks apart.</i>

526

<i>They've each won one,</i>

<i>The left hook to the jaw,</i>

<i>He was down in the last fight, too.</i>

534

- ...six... seven...

Sugar Ray Robinson!

550
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:38,474
Cocksuckers!
I'd like to fuckin'--

551
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,645
- For Christ's sake!
- I'll kill those cocksuckers!

552
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,208
They only gave him
that fuckin' decision

553
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:50,912
'cause he's goin' in the Army next week, 
that's the only reason.

554
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,785
I knocked him down,

- What the hell I gotta do?
- You won and they robbed ya!

556
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:58,892
They're miserable,

the fuckin' ass, that's why!

558
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:05,935
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey.
Maybe it's comin' back to me.

559
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,071
Who knows? I'm a jinx, maybe.
Who the hell knows?

560
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,435
Forget about all that shit--
this was your shot.

561
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,171
They robbed us!
They out and out robbed us!

562
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,510
- It's Vickie, you wanna talk to her?
- I don't wanna talk to nobody.

563
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:22,951
- Joey, take her home.
- All right.

564
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:31,324
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:32,588
You sure?

566
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,221

<i>Yeah, child. I am coming back 
and bash you on your head one more time.</i>

568
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,835
Don't ever do that Janiro bullshit again,

569
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:07,000
no more deals like that,
you hear what I'm sayin'?

570
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,044
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

571
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,376
Look at that-- 168 pounds.

572
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:13,676
- Stop eatin'.
- What's with the smart answers?

573
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:15,944
I told ya I didn't wanna do it
in the first place, didn't I?

574
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:17,144
No, you didn't say that.

575
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,155
You're the one that told me
you could get down to 155 pounds.

576
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,122
Where'd I get it?
Did I pull it out of the fuckin' air?

577
00:44:22,225 --> 00:44:24,056
I don't know if I'm gonna 
make it down to 155.

578
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,220
I'm lucky I make it to 160.

579
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:28,695
And on top of that,
you sign me for a fight at 155,

580
00:44:28,798 --> 00:44:31,790
and If I don't make the 155, 
I lose $15,000?!

581
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,063
- That's right.
- You're supposed to be a manager!

582
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,695
You're supposed to know
what you're doin'.

583
00:44:35,805 --> 00:44:38,706
- I did just what I wanted to do.
- That's what I'm worried about, you--

584
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,400
- You want a title shot?
- What are ya talkin' about?

585
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,570
- Do you want a title shot?
- What am I, in a circus over here?

586
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,205
I ask him, he's got more sense about this. 
What are you doin'?

587
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,580
You been killin' yourself
for three years now, right?

588
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:52,985
There's nobody's left for you to fight.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

589
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:55,489
Along comes this kid Janiro.
He don't know any better.

590
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,117
He's a young kid, up and comin',
he'll fight anybody.

591
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,490
Good, you fight him.

592
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,929
Bust his hole. Tear him apart.
What are you worried about?

593
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,694
What's the biggest thing
you got to worry about?

594
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:06,666
- I'm worried about the weight.
- You're worried about the weight?

595
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,670
What we arguin' for?
I just said the weight.

596
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,138
Let's say you lose
because of your weight.

597
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,936
Are they gonna think
you're not as tough as you were?

598
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,772
You're not the same fighter?

599
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,607
Good. They'll match you
with all those guys

600
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,476
they were afraid to match you 
with you before. 

601
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,710
What happens? You'll kill 'em.
And they gotta give you a title shot.

602
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:24,912
- Bring me coffee, please.
- Why? There's nobody else.

603
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:26,045
Nobody's left.

604
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,215
- Who they gonna give it to?
- Coffee.

605
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,292
- In a minute.
- You listenin' to me?

606
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,656
- Please, honey, bring me the coffee.
- All right, just a minute.

607
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:35,026
- How long I gotta wait?!
- Are you listenin'?

608
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:37,656
Now let's say you win,
you beat Janiro.

609
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:40,463
Which you definitely should beat him, right?

610
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,798
- Yeah.
- Right?

611
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:42,963
- Yeah.
- They still gotta give you

612
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,371
a shot at the title.
You know why?

613
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:46,999
- Why?
- 'Cause the same thing as before,

614
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,305
there's nobody left,
there ain't nobody around.

615
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:50,777
They gotta give you the shot.

616
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,075
Ya understand?
If you win, you win.

617
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,775
If you lose, you still win.

618
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:57,648
There's no way you can lose,
and you do it on your own,

619
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:00,314
just the way you wanted to do it,
without help from anybody.

620
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:03,915
Ya understand? Just get down to 155 pounds, 
ya fat bastard.

621
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:07,656
Stop eatin'. What's the problem?
Stop eatin', that's all, you can do it.

622
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,664
You don't understand anything,
do you understand that?

623
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,996
Joey's right, this Janiro
is an up-and-coming fighter,

624
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,660
he's good-lookin', he's popular.

625
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,738
- You beat him now--
- Excuse me, what do you mean,

626
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,773
- good-lookin'?
- I'm not sayin' good-lookin',

627
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:20,274
- I'm sayin' popular. If you win--
- But what were you just sayin'

628
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:21,867
- about good-lookin', popular?
- I'm not sayin' anything.

629
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:25,175
- I'm just tellin' you Joey's right.
- Are you an authority, or what?

630
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,079
- Nothin'--
- Get outta here.

631
00:46:27,183 --> 00:46:30,209
Get outta here.
Take the baby and get outta here.

632
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:33,816
Everybody all of a sudden's
an authority about this.

633
00:46:33,923 --> 00:46:36,858
Where'd she find out he's good-lookin', 
first of all?

634
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,188
She didn't mean nothin'.

635
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:42,564
Who asked you?

636
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,327
You gonna start with me now?

637
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,402
When people are talkin',
you don't interrupt.

638
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:50,132
It's none of your business, 
especially if it's my brother and his wife.

639
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,605
Ain't got nothin' to do with you.

640
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,302
Get outta here, go inside.
Take the baby inside.

641
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,744
Come on. 
Let's leave the grouches here, okay?

642
00:46:57,847 --> 00:47:00,407
- Come on.
- Change her diapers, can't you see?

643
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,281
- She's gonna cry, she stinks.
- You make her cry.

644
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:07,311
- I'm gonna make you cry.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on.

645
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:13,492
- They're a couple of babies.
- 155 pounds--

646
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:15,530
let's go to the training camp.

647
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:18,931
No distractions, no wives, no phone calls.

648
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:21,833
Nobody around to bother you.
I'll write out your usual schedule,

649
00:47:21,938 --> 00:47:24,600
- your usual diet--
- Listen, I wanna ask you somethin'.

650
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,609
When I'm away, you ever notice 
anything funny goin' on with her?

651
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,440
- With who, Vickie?
- Yeah.

652
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:30,877
Like what?

653
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,948
What do you think I mean?

654
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,115
No, I don't notice anything.

655
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:38,278
I want you to keep an eye on her, 
all right?

656
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,356
For what, Jack?
She don't do anything wrong.

657
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:43,255
I want you to keep an eye on her 
when I'm away, all right?

658
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,295
You just start trouble for nothin',
I'm tellin' ya, you're crackin' up.

659
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,727
I got a reason, right?

660
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,493
You and I both know, any woman, 
given the right time,

661
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,467
the right place, the right circumstances,
they'll do anything, right?

662
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,061
I mean, anything's possible.
All right?

663
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:57,400
- You're right.
- You oughta know.

664
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,840
You're not wrong, but you're pickin' 
on this girl, 'cause I saw you before.

665
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,571
You're worried about your weight,
you're gettin' aggravated,

666
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,240
and you tell her, "What are you-- ?
Go inside. Who asked ya?"

667
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:08,817
Botherin' her for that, you're gonna 
give her an excuse to go out.

668
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,010
- She was talkin' about a guy.
- So?

669
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,317
So what? She was talkin'
on your behalf, she wasn't--

670
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:17,393
On my behalf? She was talkin' about a pretty kid, 
sayin' he's good-lookin'.

671
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,552
What are you talkin' about?

672
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:20,356
So you make him ugly,
what's the difference?

673
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:21,725
- That's why?
- Never mind, just do it.

674
00:48:21,831 --> 00:48:22,798
All right.

675
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,269
You know what you should do?
Go inside and be nice to her.

676
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,928
Make up with her.

677
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:31,131
Tell her you're gonna take her out, 
we'll go out.

678
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,004
You wanna go out before you go away, 
don't you?

679
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:34,508
This way, you go away
with a clear head.

680
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:35,600
You know you took her out,

681
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,010
you wined and dined her,
you had a good time.

682
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:39,081
All right?

683
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,210
All right.
Where do you wanna go?

684
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:44,878
- Well, "out" out, you know. 
- All right.

685
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:48,287
Listen, though, if you tell her now,
pull her on the side.

686
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:50,552
Don't say nothin' in front of Lenore...

687
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,651
- 'cause I'm not takin' her.
- It's on your head.

688
00:48:52,762 --> 00:48:54,923
- All right.
- We can go without her.

689
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:57,864
- Do what you're gonna do.
- Oh, I am.

690
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:03,598
Come here.

691
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:30,866
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

692
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,094
it's great to be back
in the Copa Lounge.

693
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,534
What a great audience.

694
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:37,606
Come on, lady, laugh it up--
I laughed when you come in.

695
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:42,536
But seriously speakin', folks,
we have a special guest with us tonight.

696
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:46,547
I'd like to introduce the world's
leading middleweight contender,

697
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:49,345
the Bronx Bull, the raging bull.

698
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:52,944
Let's hear it for the great Jake La Motta, 
ladies and gentlemen.

699
00:49:58,761 --> 00:50:00,160
What's your name again?

700
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,754
- Janet.
- Janet, sorry, yeah, just been...

701
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:05,663
It's, uh, toast time.

702
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:11,768
He hits me with a left hook--
no hand, just a hook he had.

703
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,307
- Where you goin'?
- Goin' to the bathroom.

704
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:21,114
Hey, Vickie.

705
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:22,878
- Hi.
- Gee, you're lookin' great.

706
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,146
- Thanks.
- Joe here?

707
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:25,721
Yeah, they're over there.
Jake's here, too.

708
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,551
That's great.
Listen, I'm over here

709
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,147
with Tommy and some of the old gang.

710
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,749
You get a chance,
come over and have a drink.

711
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,986
See ya later.

712
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:37,723
- Hello, Jake, how are you?
- How you doin'?

713
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,392
You're not drinkin', are ya?

714
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,165
- Joey, how are ya?
- How you doin', Sal?

715
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,503
Look like you're havin' a ball over here.

716
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:46,734
I'm over there with Tommy Como.

717
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,037
Why don't you come over
and have a drink?

718
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:50,704
Tommy's here?
I didn't even see him come in.

719
00:50:50,813 --> 00:50:52,371
Charlie Rocks,
what are we gonna do here?

720
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,143
What you got?
What's the odds?

721
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,080
I'll see you later, Joey.

722
00:51:00,723 --> 00:51:03,351
Hey, that's some suit.
He looks good, huh, Jack?

723
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,925
I thought that was my best joke.

724
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,967
Rita, Look who's here.

725
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,539
Hi, Vickie.

726
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,766
Hey, Vickie.

727
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,173
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How are ya, honey?

728
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:24,144
Good to see ya.
Say hello to Charlie.

729
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,340
- Sit down, have a drink.
- I can't, I have to get back to Jake.

730
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:30,180
- I just came by to say hello.
- All right, honey, thanks for comin' by.

731
00:51:30,286 --> 00:51:34,086
- Not a bad kid, that Vickie, ya know.
- She's with that fuckin' gorilla.

732
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,055
She must've caught 
a hundred beatin's off that guy.

733
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,895
- What took ya so long?
- I went by Tommy's table to say hello.

734
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:46,230
I saw you say hello to them all.
But what took ya so long?

735
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:50,166
Nothin', I said hello.
I came back.

736
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:53,742
- What else did you say?
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.

737
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:56,812
I said, "No, Jake and Joey 
are over there", and I left.

738
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,006
What were you talkin' to Salvy for?

739
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,946
He asked me if Joey was there,
I said, "He's over there."

740
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:05,179
Then he said, "Tommy's over there,
why don't you go say hello?" And I did.

741
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,016
Are you interested in him?

742
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,115
No, why would I be interested in him?

743
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:12,126
You sure you're not interested in him?

744
00:52:12,228 --> 00:52:13,195
Yeah.

745
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,192
In other words, you're not interested in him, 
but you could be interested

746
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,667
- in somebody?
- Jake, don't start.

747
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,898
What do you gotta-- ? Hey, shut up,
or I'm gonna smack you in the face.

748
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,702
You embarrass me.

749
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:28,436
These are from Mr. Como.

750
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:33,512
Shall I take the...?

751
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,942
- What?
- Should I take this?

752
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,952
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with it.

753
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,614
- Okay.
- These are the jokes, folks.

754
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:44,716
I tell ya the truth, it's so--
Hi, how are ya, you bald-headed fag?

755
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:50,995
- Hey, Joey.
- Tommy, thanks for the drinks.

756
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,727
- Come on, any time.
- Charlie, how are ya?

757
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:54,598
How you doin', Joey?
How's everything?

758
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:57,104
- Where's Jake?
- He's over there, he don't wanna come.

759
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:02,869
- If you call him, he'll come.
- All right.

760
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:07,372
- I'll be right back.
- Here he comes.

761
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:09,383
What is it?
You don't call anybody anymore.

762
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:12,784
We never see ya anymore.
For cryin' out loud.

763
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,381
You never come around anymore?
You can't even make a call? What is it?

764
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,925
I'm busy, I'm goin' away fightin', 
I'm busy.

765
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:22,293
Busy, busy.
Look at him takin' me seriously.

766
00:53:22,398 --> 00:53:25,128
I'm only kiddin' you,
what a fuckin' kid.

767
00:53:25,234 --> 00:53:27,464
- That's the best fuckin' fighter around.
- Hey, Jake.

768
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,538
- How you doin'?
- Them <i>mulignanes</i>,

769
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:32,107
forget about it,
they're all afraid to fight you. 

770
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,438
- How you feelin', all right?
- I'm all right.

771
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,274
- Good? Strong?
- Strong, yeah. I'm doin' okay.

772
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,644
Then Janiro's gotta watch his ass, right?

773
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:41,541
I think he should.

774
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,316
Last three, four times,
I won nothin' but money with the guy.

775
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,479
He's no piece of cake,
that's a good fighter.

776
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,682
Very attractive guy.
All the girls like him.

777
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:50,816
No marks, clean.

778
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:55,929
Jake, am I wrong?
Did you gain a few pounds?

779
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,762
A few pounds. I'll knock it off right away, 
though, no problem.

780
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:00,631
Right off, right off.

781
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:06,205
Look, let me ask you somethin'.
I'm just talkin' now, just talkin'.

782
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,109
I come to you, and I'm tellin' you
that I'm gonna bet a lot of money on you

783
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,579
in this fight with Janiro, right?

784
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:13,808
Yeah?

785
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:17,786
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

786
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,855
I would say bet everything you got.

787
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:22,186
- Everything?
- Everything.

788
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,956
'Cause I'm gonna open his hole like this.

789
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,688
Excuse my French, girls.

790
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:30,698
- I'm gonna make him suffer.
- What's wrong with this guy?

791
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,963
I'm gonna make his mother wish
she never had him.

792
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,470
- Is this somethin' personal?
- Make him into dog meat. What?

793
00:54:36,572 --> 00:54:39,507
- Did he say somethin' in the papers?
- No, he's a nice kid.

794
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,167
He's a pretty kid, too.

795
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:44,405
I don't know, I got a problem--
if I should fuck him or fight him.

796
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:49,550
Must be crazy.
Fuck him or fight him.

797
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:52,917
You're really liable to get fucked
with this kid, watch out.

798
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:54,580
- By who?
- Janiro.

799
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,749
You mean you want me 
to get him to fuck you?

800
00:54:56,859 --> 00:54:57,883
- Me?
- Yeah.

801
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,622
- No, I don't want him to fuck me.
- I could do that easily.

802
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,697
How you gonna do that?

803
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,993
I'll get youse both in the ring
and give youse both a fuckin' beatin',

804
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,658
and you both could fuck each other.

805
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:09,861
- I'll get all full of blood.
- You're used to that.

806
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:14,241
Come on, drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

807
00:55:14,343 --> 00:55:16,004
- Come on, <i>salute</i>.
- <i>Salute.</i>

808
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,737
- Jake, good luck.
- <i>Salute.</i> Good luck, Jake.

809
00:55:56,018 --> 00:55:57,610
Hey, Vick.

810
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,856
- What?
- You awake?

811
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:05,986
No.

812
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:11,399
- Can you hear me?
- What?

813
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,770
You ever think of anybody else...

814
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,107
when we're in bed?

815
00:56:23,145 --> 00:56:25,705
- What do you mean?
- You know, when we make love.

816
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:29,375
No, nobody, I love you.

817
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,552
How come you said that thing 
about Janiro?

818
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,956
- What did I say?
- You said he had a pretty face.

819
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:40,924
I never noticed his face.

820
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:44,132
How come you said that, then?

821
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:49,464
I don't even know what I said.
I don't even know what he looks like.

822
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:51,636
Go to sleep.

823
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:11,464
- He ain't pretty no more.
- He really messed him up.

824
00:58:14,346 --> 00:58:17,838
And the winner by unanimous decision

825
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,613
in ten rounds, Jake La Motta!

826
00:58:46,445 --> 00:58:49,744
Give me a little piece of ice,
just a sliver, just for my tongue.

827
00:58:50,349 --> 00:58:53,147
- No water!
- Come on, I'm dyin'.

828
00:58:53,952 --> 00:58:55,749
Fuckin' hard-on.

829
00:58:57,656 --> 00:58:59,055
Four pounds.

830
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:02,151
Keep workin'.
Cut the bullshit.

831
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:11,960
I saw him fight with Janiro,
I couldn't believe it--

832
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:14,163
destroyed this guy,
it was absolutely incredible.

833
00:59:14,272 --> 00:59:16,570
He knocked his nose 
from one side of his face to the other.

834
00:59:16,675 --> 00:59:19,303
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
- Fuckin' thing was hangin' off.

835
00:59:19,411 --> 00:59:21,572
Who you fightin' next?
Can you tell me?

836
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,409
I don't know.
You never know these things--

837
00:59:23,515 --> 00:59:26,245
From all I've seen,
they gotta give him that title shot.

838
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,279
Jackie Curtie, Joey.

839
00:59:28,387 --> 00:59:29,718
- You should know each other.
- Hi, Joey.

840
00:59:29,821 --> 00:59:31,721
Pleasure-- heard a lot 
of nice things about you.

841
00:59:31,823 --> 00:59:33,154
We're gonna get the title shot, too.

842
00:59:33,258 --> 00:59:36,125
I'm sure. I like your brother.
Made a lot of money on him.

843
00:59:36,228 --> 00:59:37,923
Probably more than he did,
that's for sure.

844
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:40,260
Made some nice cabbage
on the Oscar Jackson fight.

845
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,061
Whatever happened to Oscar?

846
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:44,795
- Anybody see him anymore?
- He's punchy, he probably died.

847
00:59:44,903 --> 00:59:46,393
Who the fuck cares?

848
00:59:46,505 --> 00:59:47,802
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- It's a beautiful table.

849
00:59:47,906 --> 00:59:49,601
- The worst table in the house.
- And he's complainin'.

850
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:51,005
It's a beautiful table.

851
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:53,270
He's workin' downtown,
big building-- workin' an elevator.

852
00:59:53,378 --> 00:59:54,709
Happened to be there the other day.

853
00:59:54,813 --> 00:59:57,247
I'm not Italian, I don't care.

854
00:59:57,349 --> 00:59:59,078
- Took me right up.
- Hey, that Oscar's always

855
00:59:59,184 --> 01:00:01,209
a stand-up guy, Joey,
he did you a lot of good.

856
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:02,877
Gave your brother a hell of a fight, too.

857
01:00:02,988 --> 01:00:05,923
Yeah, Mickey?
Cutty Sark and water. 

858
01:00:06,024 --> 01:00:07,048
Excuse me one minute, fellas.

859
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:08,683
- I'll be right back.
- Come back, Joey.

860
01:00:08,794 --> 01:00:10,819
Come on back. Okay. 

861
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:14,298
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
01:00:14,399 --> 01:00:15,593
Hey, Joe.

863
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:19,068
- Hey, Joey.
- Look at how he's lookin' at us.

864
01:00:19,171 --> 01:00:21,401
- Something's happening.
- She's having a problem.

865
01:00:21,506 --> 01:00:25,101
- You're worried about it?
- I'm just sittin' there havin' a drink!

866
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,973
- Shut up. Keep your mouth shut.
- Both of youse are the same.

867
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:28,068
I feel like I'm a prisoner.

868
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,172
I can't walk, I look at somebody
the wrong way, I get smacked.

869
01:00:32,017 --> 01:00:33,814
You think you're right or somethin',
the way you're fuckin' yellin'?

870
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,318
- I am right.
- You're wrong.

871
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,149
I am right.
I'm tired of having to turn around

872
01:00:37,255 --> 01:00:39,348
and havin' both of youse
up my ass all the time.

873
01:00:40,892 --> 01:00:42,223
- Shut up.
- No.

874
01:00:42,327 --> 01:00:43,794
- Don't make me--
- I'm tired of listenin' to you

875
01:00:43,895 --> 01:00:46,955
- and your brother. I'm not wrong.
- Don't make me get nuts in this place.

876
01:00:47,065 --> 01:00:48,191
What am I supposed to do?

877
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:50,494
I'm 20 years old, I gotta go home
and sleep by myself every night?

878
01:00:50,602 --> 01:00:52,365
- What the fuck did you marry him for?
- 'Cause I love him.

879
01:00:52,471 --> 01:00:54,132
- You do?
- Yeah, I love him.

880
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:57,208
What am I supposed to do?
This guy don't even wanna fuck me.

881
01:00:58,376 --> 01:00:59,934
He's just been a contender too long.

882
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:03,173
He'll be all right as soon as he gets his shot, 
and then everything'll be okay.

883
01:01:03,281 --> 01:01:05,943
You won't have to go fuckin' 
runnin' around when he does.

884
01:01:06,051 --> 01:01:08,417
Jake is never gonna be champ.
Too many people hate him.

885
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,045
- And you're drinking with them!
- And I'm gonna finish my drink

886
01:01:11,156 --> 01:01:13,954
- and I'm gonna have a good time.
- Get your stuff.

887
01:01:18,897 --> 01:01:20,125
I said you ain't stayin' here.

888
01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:21,221
- Get your stuff.
- I'm stayin'.

889
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:23,301
You're making an asshole
out of my brother, get your stuff.

890
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:24,629
- Come on, relax.
- Shut up.

891
01:01:24,736 --> 01:01:26,431
Mind your fuckin' business and shut up.

892
01:01:26,538 --> 01:01:29,132
- You're taking this all wrong.
- I said shut up, didn't I?!

893
01:01:29,241 --> 01:01:31,141
What's the matter with you?
There's nothin' goin' on here.

894
01:01:31,243 --> 01:01:33,370
This is innocent.
We're only having a few drinks.

895
01:01:34,713 --> 01:01:36,908
- Relax, no problem.
- Come on, you know better than that.

896
01:01:37,015 --> 01:01:40,382
- All right. Let's all calm down.
- Just relax, come on.

897
01:01:40,485 --> 01:01:41,577
- We've been friends a long time.
- I'm just upset.

898
01:01:41,686 --> 01:01:44,280
- It's my brother's wife...
- There's nothing goin' on over here.

899
01:01:44,389 --> 01:01:45,378
I'm sorry, I really am.

900
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:46,787
We're friends,
we can straighten this--

901
01:01:47,325 --> 01:01:49,555
Right? Nothing going on?!

902
01:01:49,661 --> 01:01:52,789
Nothing going on?!
Ya dirty cocksucker!

903
01:01:56,368 --> 01:01:59,531
- Fuckin' hard-on!
- Get off! Get him off!

904
01:01:59,638 --> 01:02:02,801
I'll bite your fuckin' head off,
ya cocksucker!

905
01:02:02,908 --> 01:02:05,809
Get outta here, Joey!
What the fuck are you doin'?!

906
01:02:06,545 --> 01:02:08,513
- Easy, easy! Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

907
01:02:08,613 --> 01:02:10,376
- Come on!
- Come on!

908
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:13,430
Fuckin' cunt.

909
01:02:14,534 --> 01:02:15,762
Get out! Get outta the way!

910
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,168
Oh, scumbag!
I'm gonna suck your fuckin' eyes out!

911
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:24,201
Hey, you fuckin'--
what are you, nuts?!

912
01:02:24,311 --> 01:02:25,335
Don't mention Tommy.

913
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:27,504
You do what you do,
and we do what we gotta do.

914
01:02:27,614 --> 01:02:29,445
- Don't mention no names.
- No, you're wrong, Joe.

915
01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:31,574
He's wrong.
No fuckin' trouble in the joint.

916
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:40,119
I said get outta here,
ya fuckin' <i>mamone</i>!

917
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,923
Get back there, ya fuck, ya!

918
01:02:43,897 --> 01:02:45,626
Take it easy, people.
Come on, now, take it easy.

919
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:50,131
You've had it, you rat bastard!

920
01:03:08,588 --> 01:03:10,749
You guys have a lot of years between you,

921
01:03:10,857 --> 01:03:12,882
and you've done a lot of things together.

922
01:03:12,993 --> 01:03:15,587
I understand, Joey,
it was your brother's wife.

923
01:03:15,695 --> 01:03:17,293
But you don't raise your hands

924
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:20,729
you don't create a scene like that 
in a place like that.

925
01:03:20,834 --> 01:03:23,564
Now, we've heard everybody's 
point of view here,

926
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,831
and we're gonna forget about it.

927
01:03:25,939 --> 01:03:29,397
I shouldn't forget about it,
but we're gonna forget about it.

928
01:03:30,043 --> 01:03:31,169
Right?

929
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:33,337
What I want you to do now,
you two guys,

930
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:36,541
I want you to shake hands,
forget this whole thing,

931
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,174
and no grudges.

932
01:03:38,285 --> 01:03:41,083
That's the most important thing--
no grudges.

933
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:43,852
Now, come on, shake hands.

934
01:03:48,562 --> 01:03:51,030
It's all right with me
if it's all right with you.

935
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:52,257
All right?

936
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:55,293
I only wish this thing never happened.

937
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:57,233
We all wish it never happened.

938
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:00,465
Right?
You'll get over it.

939
01:04:00,574 --> 01:04:03,702
Salvy, let me talk with him alone a minute.

940
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:04,936
Yeah, all right.

941
01:04:07,113 --> 01:04:09,411
I'll see you Monday,
Tuesday or somethin', all right?

942
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,541
I'm sorry, I forgot all about it.

943
01:04:12,085 --> 01:04:14,883
What are you, fucking nuts?
You're killin' me.

944
01:04:19,793 --> 01:04:22,660
Aside from everything else,
is the family all right?

945
01:04:22,762 --> 01:04:25,526
Yeah, they're fine.
Everybody's fine.

946
01:04:29,269 --> 01:04:31,328
What is it with you?
You can't talk?

947
01:04:31,438 --> 01:04:32,962
- I'm talkin', what do you mean?
- I know.

948
01:04:33,073 --> 01:04:36,338
Why have you got this funny attitude?
I can't figure you out.

949
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:40,506
What is it with all the quick answers?
"Yeah, they're all right. Yeah."

950
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:43,774
You wanna get outta here 
fast or something?

951
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,249
No, it's nothin' like that.

952
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:48,253
It's just all the aggravation
and everything and...

953
01:04:48,822 --> 01:04:50,289
all the fights and all.

954
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:54,492
Listen to me.
Now, Jake...

955
01:04:55,428 --> 01:04:58,022
the guy's become an embarrassment.

956
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:01,860
He's embarrassin' me with certain people,

957
01:05:01,968 --> 01:05:04,232
and I'm lookin' very bad.

958
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:08,204
I can't deliver a kid 
from my own goddamn neighborhood.

959
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:09,800
What is it with him?

960
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,879
Why does he have to make it
so hard on himself?

961
01:05:12,979 --> 01:05:15,607
He comes to me,
I make it easier for him.

962
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:20,712
The man's got a head of rock.

963
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:28,156
You know, it's hard to explain, 
Tommy, he's...

964
01:05:28,862 --> 01:05:30,159
Jack respects you.

965
01:05:30,263 --> 01:05:32,731
I mean, he don't even 
say hello to anybody.

966
01:05:32,832 --> 01:05:35,130
You he talks to, he likes you.

967
01:05:36,636 --> 01:05:39,230
It's just that when he gets somethin' 
on his mind,

968
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:42,331
he's got a hard head,
he likes to do things his own way.

969
01:05:42,442 --> 01:05:44,808
Jesus Christ could
come off the cross sometimes,

970
01:05:44,911 --> 01:05:47,345
he don't give a fuck,
he's gonna do what he wants to do,

971
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:50,473
he wants to make it on his own.
He thinks he can make it on his own.

972
01:05:50,584 --> 01:05:51,881
Make it on his own.

973
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:57,048
He thinks he's gonna walk in there
and become champion on his own?

974
01:05:57,791 --> 01:06:00,624
- He's crazy. You know he's nuts.
- Yeah, he's crazy.

975
01:06:00,727 --> 01:06:04,128
And he's got no respect for nobody,
he doesn't listen to nobody.

976
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,527
That's not crazy.

977
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:09,033
- He respects you, though.
- He doesn't respect anybody.

978
01:06:09,135 --> 01:06:11,262
Now, you do this for me,
you understand?

979
01:06:11,371 --> 01:06:16,570
You tell him I don't care how colorful he is, 
how great he is.

980
01:06:16,676 --> 01:06:18,303
He could beat all the 
Sugar Ray Robinsons

981
01:06:18,411 --> 01:06:20,436
and the Tony Janiros in the world.

982
01:06:20,547 --> 01:06:24,108
But he ain't gonna get a shot at that title, 
not without us, he ain't.

983
01:06:24,951 --> 01:06:27,044
Now, you're a smart kid.

984
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,547
You go to him, you tell him...

985
01:06:34,694 --> 01:06:35,991
Son of a bitch.

986
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,657
Twenty dollar shoe here.

987
01:06:45,872 --> 01:06:47,840
Aren't you gonna ask me what happened?

988
01:06:52,045 --> 01:06:53,171
What's the matter?

989
01:06:55,882 --> 01:06:58,510
- What's wrong?
- I remember when I met her here.

990
01:06:59,552 --> 01:07:01,679
- Who?
- Vickie.

991
01:07:04,724 --> 01:07:07,693
Why, what's the matter?
What'd she do now?

992
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:13,966
I know she's doin' somethin',
I just wanna catch her once.

993
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:15,193
Just once.

994
01:07:18,805 --> 01:07:21,774
Hey, Jack.
Wanna do yourself a favor?

995
01:07:22,308 --> 01:07:24,538
Bust her fuckin' hole,
throw her out.

996
01:07:25,078 --> 01:07:27,638
Either that, or live with her
and let her ruin your life,

997
01:07:27,747 --> 01:07:29,544
'cause that's what's happenin'.

998
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:35,321
How much could you take?
How much shit could you take?

999
01:07:45,198 --> 01:07:46,756
So, what'd that guy say?

1000
01:07:47,701 --> 01:07:50,329
He gave me the old
"good news, bad news" routine.

1001
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:51,928
The good news is

1002
01:07:52,038 --> 01:07:54,165
you're gonna get the shot at the title.

1003
01:07:54,274 --> 01:07:58,506
The bad news is they want you to do 
the old flip-flop for them.

1004
01:07:59,612 --> 01:08:01,603
- So, what else is new?
- What'd you expect?

1005
01:08:01,715 --> 01:08:03,148
You didn't know that was comin'?

1006
01:08:04,217 --> 01:08:05,878
You win some, you lose some.

1007
01:08:05,985 --> 01:08:07,452
This one, we're losin'.

1008
01:08:09,789 --> 01:08:10,915
Billy Fox.

1009
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:15,258
173 and 3/4 pounds.

1010
01:08:17,831 --> 01:08:22,131
- Jake La Motta. 167...
- I guess you've heard by now

1011
01:08:22,235 --> 01:08:25,500
a lot of the stuff that's goin' around, 
a lot of rumors.

1012
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:29,338
Matter of fact, a short time ago
you were a big favorite,

1013
01:08:29,442 --> 01:08:31,808
and all of a sudden,
you're a 12-5 underdog,

1014
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:33,902
and people are talkin',
it's as simple as that.

1015
01:08:34,013 --> 01:08:36,811
- That's funny, I never heard anything.
- It's out there, though,

1016
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:37,974
and it's not good.

1017
01:08:38,084 --> 01:08:40,052
As a matter of fact,
the bets are off on this one.

1018
01:08:40,153 --> 01:08:41,984
Nothin' goin' in this one.

1019
01:08:42,088 --> 01:08:45,922
Matter of fact, smart money is sayin'
that you're getting ready to hit the tank.

1020
01:08:46,025 --> 01:08:48,220
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, that's bullshit.

1021
01:08:49,195 --> 01:08:50,492
You got any money you wanna bet?

1022
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:52,155
- Come on.
- I'll take the action, go ahead.

1023
01:08:52,265 --> 01:08:55,063
You bet it on Fox,
'cause I'm gonna win.

1024
01:08:55,168 --> 01:08:57,500
There's no way I'm goin' down.
I don't go down for nobody.

1025
01:08:57,604 --> 01:08:59,401
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- I want you to know that.

1026
01:08:59,506 --> 01:09:00,973
- All right.
- All right, Colonel.

1027
01:09:01,074 --> 01:09:02,564
Okay, that's it.

1028
01:09:02,675 --> 01:09:04,006
You came down here just for that nonsense?

1029
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:05,805
- That was it?
- That was it.

1030
01:09:16,256 --> 01:09:17,848
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1031
01:09:17,957 --> 01:09:20,858
Welcome to the Madison Square Garden

1032
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,053
feature attraction.

1033
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:27,725
- In this corner, weighing 175 pounds...
- Commissioner, how about a picture?

1034
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:29,631
Fellas, can we get a picture over here?

1035
01:09:29,736 --> 01:09:33,536
the undefeated Billy Fox. 

1036
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:39,402
Hi, Steve. 
Your brother got out of the hospital?

1037
01:09:39,512 --> 01:09:42,504
- They think it's all right.
- Did he get out? Good.

1038
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:46,785
- Charlie, let me sit over there.
- Yeah, sure.

1039
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:50,884
Tommy, what's the matter?
Everything's all right?

1040
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:52,423
It's all right, yeah.

1041
01:09:52,525 --> 01:09:54,186
Touch gloves now, come out boxing.

1042
01:09:54,294 --> 01:09:56,091
Five seconds, Alex.

1043
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:11,404
Come on, stand--
come on, stand up!

1044
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:14,207
What the fuck you doin'?
Hit me, ya fuckin' bum, come on.

1045
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:16,007
Come on.

1046
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:20,050
What are you doin', Jake?!
Come on, box him!

1047
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,693
What the fuck's the matter with you?

1048
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:34,291
What do you think
you're doin' out there?!

1049
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,697
- Huh?
- Little slow, that's all.

1050
01:10:35,802 --> 01:10:38,362
- What are you doin' out there?
- Take it easy, he'll be all right.

1051
01:10:38,471 --> 01:10:41,634
He's a little slow. He'll make it up,
what are ya worried about?

1052
01:10:41,741 --> 01:10:45,302
Goddamn it. Come on,
pick it up a little, Jake, I'm sorry.

1053
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:47,641
Come on, Jake,
I got some money on ya!

1054
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:50,409
- Tank job!
- Hit him back, ya bum!

1055
01:10:50,516 --> 01:10:51,813
- Come on.
- Hit him back!

1056
01:10:52,752 --> 01:10:55,687
You fuckin' bum!
You're takin' a dive in the fourth?

1057
01:10:56,222 --> 01:10:58,315
Pocket your dirty money!

1058
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,488
Aw, you phony bastard!
That's a fix!

1059
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:05,154
We're stoppin' the fight!

1060
01:11:05,732 --> 01:11:09,031
What the fuck are you waitin' for
to stop the fight, ya jerk?!

1061
01:11:09,602 --> 01:11:10,660
And you standin' there.

1062
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:13,762
- Fuckin' go down, will ya?
- The referee stops this bout

1063
01:11:13,873 --> 01:11:18,572
at 2:23 of the fourth round.

1064
01:11:18,678 --> 01:11:22,079
The winner by technical knockout,

1065
01:11:22,181 --> 01:11:24,342
and still undefeated,

1066
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:27,442
Billy Fox!

1067
01:11:29,222 --> 01:11:30,689
What'd I do?!

1068
01:11:42,902 --> 01:11:43,960
Don't fight anymore.

1069
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,868
It's a free country,
don't fight anymore.

1070
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:52,041
Aw, what'd I do?
What'd I do?

1071
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,577
What'd I do?

1072
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:07,559
- Get outta here!
- Jake has an interview--

1073
01:12:09,595 --> 01:12:12,564
It's all right, Jake.
It's all right.

1074
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,068
Why did I do it? Why?

1075
01:12:22,675 --> 01:12:24,973
They got some balls, some balls.

1076
01:12:26,212 --> 01:12:28,339
I take the dive.
What more do they want?

1077
01:12:28,881 --> 01:12:30,439
They want me to go down, too?

1078
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,018
I ain't goin' down.
I ain't goin' down for nobody.

1079
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:35,747
Why don't you do me a favor?
Just put your hands up.

1080
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:38,153
I wanna show you somethin'.
Put your hands up.

1081
01:12:39,392 --> 01:12:43,192
- What the fuck is so hard about that?
- Hey, you don't understand.

1082
01:12:44,297 --> 01:12:46,857
I had to fight a bum.
He's a bum.

1083
01:12:46,966 --> 01:12:49,867
I fought the guy, I tapped him like that,
all of a sudden he's like this

1084
01:12:49,969 --> 01:12:51,596
all over the place,
what am I gonna do?

1085
01:12:51,704 --> 01:12:53,797
You don't have to fuckin' pick him up 
and help him.

1086
01:12:53,906 --> 01:12:55,601
What am I gonna do?
If I don't pick him up,

1087
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:57,938
then what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna be in worse trouble.

1088
01:12:58,745 --> 01:13:00,269
I don't know.

1089
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,406
"Purse was withheld--" look at this--
"Purse was withheld pending

1090
01:13:03,516 --> 01:13:05,575
D.A.'s probe."
Look at that.

1091
01:13:05,685 --> 01:13:08,279
Look how they make me look.

1092
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:10,413
Like a bum, like a <i>mammalucco</i>.

1093
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,057
A what?

1094
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:14,422
Like the <i>mammalucco</i> of the year.

1095
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:16,154
Tommy ain't gonna forget us.

1096
01:13:16,996 --> 01:13:19,556
You're gonna get your shot,
as long as he don't die.

1097
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:22,758
- As long as who don't die?
- Tommy.

1098
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:24,427
What are you talkin' about?

1099
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:26,437
In other words,
Tommy ain't gonna forget ya,

1100
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:27,767
you're gonna get your shot
if he don't die.

1101
01:13:27,874 --> 01:13:29,933
- Gotta make sure the guy stays alive.
- He got a disease or somethin'?

1102
01:13:30,043 --> 01:13:31,943
No, I'm just sayin', 
I'm kiddin', like.

1103
01:13:32,045 --> 01:13:33,808
What's wrong with him?
Is somethin' wrong with him?

1104
01:13:33,913 --> 01:13:35,847
There ain't nothin' wrong with him,
that's the only way you wouldn't get it

1105
01:13:35,948 --> 01:13:38,849
- is if he dies, he won't be able to--
- What are you talkin' like that for?

1106
01:13:47,627 --> 01:13:49,117
What do you want me to do?
It's an outdoor arena.

1107
01:13:49,228 --> 01:13:52,026
What do you wanna do, fight in the rain? 
It's a stadium.

1108
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:53,723
You waited this long,
you can wait longer.

1109
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,868
You wanna wait 24 hours?
I don't wanna wait no 24 hours.

1110
01:13:56,969 --> 01:14:00,029
I don't either, but we gotta,
so we'll wait. Hello?

1111
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,800
- You guys wanna stop now?
- Get off the phone with them.

1112
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:05,468
Why do you give them the satisfaction?

1113
01:14:05,578 --> 01:14:07,876
- Get off the phone with them!
- He don't wanna talk to nobody.

1114
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,141
How many times do we have to tell ya? 
You hear him yellin'?

1115
01:14:10,249 --> 01:14:12,809
There's enough confusion up here.
Please, don't call.

1116
01:14:12,919 --> 01:14:16,218
No comment. Right.
Thank you. Bye!

1117
01:14:16,322 --> 01:14:18,313
Pains in the asses,
I don't believe them.

1118
01:14:18,424 --> 01:14:21,052
Why do you give them the satisfaction?
Why don't you just hang up on 'em?

1119
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,060
- That's all.
- I'm gonna get somethin' to eat.

1120
01:14:23,162 --> 01:14:25,289
- What do you want to eat?
- I don't want nothin'.

1121
01:14:25,832 --> 01:14:26,958
I don't want nothin'.

1122
01:14:27,066 --> 01:14:29,034
Eat somethin',
you gotta eat somethin'.

1123
01:14:31,204 --> 01:14:33,672
You can't go without eatin'.
Eat a steak.

1124
01:14:33,773 --> 01:14:36,674
You chew it, you spit it out,
you'll still make the weight tomorrow.

1125
01:14:37,376 --> 01:14:38,809
You're worried about that?

1126
01:14:41,047 --> 01:14:43,345
I'll order a steak.
At least if you want it, it's here.

1127
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:45,349
You don't want it,
do whatever you want with it.

1128
01:14:45,451 --> 01:14:47,885
- Go ahead.
- Vickie, what do you want?

1129
01:14:48,621 --> 01:14:50,452
Order me a piece of cake.

1130
01:14:50,556 --> 01:14:52,456
That's all you want is a piece of cake?

1131
01:14:52,558 --> 01:14:56,187
Why don't you get a cheeseburger, French fries? 
It's better for you.

1132
01:14:56,295 --> 01:14:58,286
- It's like a whole meal.
- Yeah, that's good.

1133
01:14:58,397 --> 01:14:59,864
That's good, order me one of those.

1134
01:14:59,966 --> 01:15:01,900
Wait a minute, what do you want to eat?

1135
01:15:02,001 --> 01:15:04,231
Since when did you order one of those?

1136
01:15:05,004 --> 01:15:06,733
- That's what I want.
- It's a free country.

1137
01:15:06,839 --> 01:15:08,966
You order what you want.
Don't let nobody influence you.

1138
01:15:09,075 --> 01:15:11,202
I'm not tellin' her what to eat,
I was just suggesting.

1139
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:13,244
What are you tellin' her
what to ask for?

1140
01:15:13,346 --> 01:15:16,474
I'm not tellin' her-- personally,
I don't give a fuck what she eats.

1141
01:15:16,582 --> 01:15:19,210
What were you tellin' her that for?

1142
01:15:19,318 --> 01:15:21,218
Order me a cheeseburger.

1143
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:26,784
Just order her a cheeseburger, 
that's all.

1144
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:29,222
What the f-- ?

1145
01:15:29,328 --> 01:15:32,422
What are you guys doin' so long?
How long does this thing take to do?

1146
01:15:32,532 --> 01:15:33,499
Forty seconds.

1147
01:15:33,599 --> 01:15:36,159
Forty seconds is no good.
You gotta do it in 30 seconds.

1148
01:15:36,269 --> 01:15:38,396
If we gotta stitch him up,
that's how much time.

1149
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,001
Ya up?

1150
01:15:44,544 --> 01:15:47,012
- What?
- Somebody's here to see ya.

1151
01:15:48,147 --> 01:15:49,512
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Tommy, how you doin'?

1152
01:15:49,615 --> 01:15:50,912
How are you?

1153
01:15:56,556 --> 01:15:58,353
Say hello to Charlie. Charlie!

1154
01:15:58,457 --> 01:16:01,085
- Jake, how are ya? Lots of luck.
- Hello, Charlie, good to see you.

1155
01:16:01,627 --> 01:16:02,924
Thank you.

1156
01:16:04,063 --> 01:16:06,998
- How you feeling?
- I'm feelin' all right, thank you.

1157
01:16:07,099 --> 01:16:10,193
- Are you feeling good?
- I feel as good as I'm gonna feel.

1158
01:16:10,303 --> 01:16:12,771
I gotta get in there and fight,
then I'll know how I'm gonna feel.

1159
01:16:12,872 --> 01:16:15,966
All right. We just come by
to wish you luck and all that.

1160
01:16:16,075 --> 01:16:17,542
- Thanks.
- You need anything?

1161
01:16:17,643 --> 01:16:19,008
- No.
- You sure, nothing?

1162
01:16:19,111 --> 01:16:20,078
No, thank you, Tommy.

1163
01:16:20,179 --> 01:16:22,238
All right.
Take care, good luck.

1164
01:16:22,348 --> 01:16:24,043
- God bless ya.
- All right, thank you.

1165
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:26,448
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

1166
01:16:27,253 --> 01:16:28,515
See you later, everybody.

1167
01:16:28,621 --> 01:16:30,486
- Vickie, good-bye.
- Tommy, wait.

1168
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:33,058
We really appreciate your comin',
I want you to know that.

1169
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:35,320
It was really nice of you.
I appreciate it.

1170
01:16:35,428 --> 01:16:38,295
- Come on, Joey, anytime.
- A time like this is very important to him.

1171
01:16:38,397 --> 01:16:40,695
- Anytime.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.

1172
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,633
So long, honey. I want you to take good care 
of that guy, all right?

1173
01:16:43,736 --> 01:16:46,000
- I'll take care of him.
- Joey, any little thing,

1174
01:16:46,105 --> 01:16:48,835
I want you to call me.
He's very nervous. Ba-boom, call.

1175
01:16:48,941 --> 01:16:49,930
Good-bye, honey.

1176
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:53,576
Would you look at that face?
What a face.

1177
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,340
Can you believe that girl?

1178
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:57,780
Look at that beauty.
Just as beautiful as ever.

1179
01:16:57,883 --> 01:17:00,078
- The least little thing, all right?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.

1180
01:17:00,186 --> 01:17:03,644
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Tommy.

1181
01:17:13,232 --> 01:17:15,029
Hey! Come here.

1182
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:17,098
Come here a minute.

1183
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:26,137
What was all that about?

1184
01:17:26,846 --> 01:17:27,870
All what?

1185
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,743
You know what I'm talkin' about.
What was that all about?

1186
01:17:31,517 --> 01:17:34,486
- With him.
- Nothin', I just said good-bye.

1187
01:17:34,587 --> 01:17:36,680
All of a sudden 
you're so friendly with him?

1188
01:17:36,789 --> 01:17:38,484
- I just said good-bye.
- You don't do that.

1189
01:17:38,591 --> 01:17:40,957
You say hello, you say good-bye,
that's all, ya hear?

1190
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,527
- I hear.
- Hey!

1191
01:17:43,129 --> 01:17:45,757
You hear what I said? 
You don't ever have any disrespect for me.

1192
01:17:45,865 --> 01:17:47,492
You hear what I said?

1193
01:17:49,068 --> 01:17:51,866
- Yeah, I hear.
- All right. Go in there.

1194
01:17:52,772 --> 01:17:54,740
- Come here.
- Why don't you stop that?

1195
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,467
Shut up, you! Shut up!

1196
01:17:56,575 --> 01:17:59,009
Shut up! 
I'll fuckin' take care of you later!

1197
01:17:59,111 --> 01:18:00,237
Shut up!

1198
01:18:08,654 --> 01:18:11,122
Disgusted with the two of youse.

1199
01:18:15,661 --> 01:18:17,060
Get to youse later.

1200
01:18:22,201 --> 01:18:24,669
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...

1201
01:18:27,206 --> 01:18:29,003
Hit the fuckin' thing, come on!

1202
01:18:31,043 --> 01:18:32,340
All right, let's go.

1203
01:19:03,242 --> 01:19:04,869
Good luck, Jake!

1204
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:49,283
For the Middleweight Championship
of the World, 15 rounds.

1205
01:19:49,388 --> 01:19:52,949
In this corner,
the very worthy challenger,

1206
01:19:53,058 --> 01:19:56,494
weighing in at 1581/4 pounds,

1207
01:19:56,595 --> 01:20:00,895
the Bronx Bull, Jake La Motta!

1208
01:20:07,473 --> 01:20:09,373
Shake hands, 
come out fighting at the bell.

1209
01:20:31,263 --> 01:20:32,594
Kill him!

1210
01:20:38,471 --> 01:20:40,029
Pressure, pressure, pressure!

1211
01:20:51,717 --> 01:20:55,175
Now finish him off.
He's all <i>stupiada</i>. You got him. 

1212
01:20:55,721 --> 01:20:56,847
Come on, Jake!

1213
01:20:58,557 --> 01:21:00,991
Blow on him, he'll fuckin' fall
right over for ya.

1214
01:21:01,093 --> 01:21:03,755
Look at him.
Do you feel all right?

1215
01:21:06,565 --> 01:21:08,396
- No way, huh?
- Can't continue?

1216
01:21:09,068 --> 01:21:11,866
Hey, Commissioner? Come on in,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1217
01:21:11,971 --> 01:21:13,438
Yeah, you did it, Jake!

1218
01:21:25,518 --> 01:21:28,646
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

1219
01:21:28,854 --> 01:21:33,257
Cerdan, unable to continue,
the referee stops the fight.

1220
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:35,589
And the winner by a technical knockout

1221
01:21:35,694 --> 01:21:37,093
in the tenth round,

1222
01:21:37,196 --> 01:21:39,960
and the new Middleweight Champion 
of the World,

1223
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:43,828
the Bronx Bull, Jake La Motta!

1224
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:50,408
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

1225
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:11,023
Don't shake that.
Don't shake it like that, I'm tellin' ya.

1226
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:12,825
It's the worst thing you could do.

1227
01:22:18,237 --> 01:22:19,534
Oh, you're home.

1228
01:22:20,573 --> 01:22:22,973
- Hi, Vick.
- Hi, Joe.

1229
01:22:25,744 --> 01:22:28,144
- Hello.
- Hi. Where were ya?

1230
01:22:28,247 --> 01:22:31,148
I went out.
What's the matter?

1231
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,717
Television won't work.

1232
01:22:33,586 --> 01:22:35,076
Where'd you go?

1233
01:22:35,187 --> 01:22:39,487
Went out, went shoppin'.
Went to my sister's. You know.

1234
01:22:50,869 --> 01:22:54,396
What's the matter with you?
What's with this kissin' on the mouth?

1235
01:22:54,506 --> 01:22:56,565
I just said hello.
Can't I kiss my sister-in-law?

1236
01:22:56,675 --> 01:22:58,199
Isn't the cheek good enough for you?

1237
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:59,277
Come on, huh?

1238
01:22:59,378 --> 01:23:00,936
I don't even kiss Mom on the mouth
the way you kiss her.

1239
01:23:01,046 --> 01:23:02,638
All of a sudden, you're like a Romeo.

1240
01:23:02,748 --> 01:23:04,682
You're not supposed to kiss your mother 
on the mouth.

1241
01:23:04,783 --> 01:23:06,410
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1242
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:13,656
- How's that?
- That looks like somethin'.

1243
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:20,790
Get back, I can't see nothin'
with your stomach in the way.

1244
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:23,992
What are you givin' me dirty looks for?

1245
01:23:26,839 --> 01:23:29,637
Supposed to be a champion,
ya eat like there's no tomorrow.

1246
01:23:29,742 --> 01:23:31,539
That's it, go ahead--
forget how long it took you

1247
01:23:31,644 --> 01:23:33,737
to get to the title,
all the years, the hard work.

1248
01:23:33,846 --> 01:23:36,576
You forgot. You're gonna defend it 
next month, keep eatin'.

1249
01:23:37,349 --> 01:23:39,977
Give me dirty looks like
I don't know what I'm talkin' about?

1250
01:23:43,522 --> 01:23:46,150
What happened with you
and Salvy at the Copa that time?

1251
01:23:46,258 --> 01:23:49,250
- When?
- When you gave him a beatin'.

1252
01:23:50,029 --> 01:23:52,190
You mean when I caught his head 
in the taxicab door,

1253
01:23:52,297 --> 01:23:54,527
and was bangin' it,
smacked him with a glass?

1254
01:23:54,633 --> 01:23:56,567
- Yeah.
- I told you about that.

1255
01:23:57,202 --> 01:23:58,669
- Didn't I?
- No.

1256
01:23:58,771 --> 01:24:01,171
- I never told you?
- No, you never told me.

1257
01:24:01,273 --> 01:24:02,604
It was no big thing, anyway.

1258
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:05,506
I smacked him in the mouth,
he was drunk, he started some shit.

1259
01:24:05,611 --> 01:24:07,806
Had to go downtown,
straighten it all out with Tommy.

1260
01:24:07,913 --> 01:24:09,904
It's all forgotten about,
supposedly, anyway.

1261
01:24:10,015 --> 01:24:12,108
How come you never told me about it?

1262
01:24:12,217 --> 01:24:14,447
It didn't have anything to do with you.

1263
01:24:16,055 --> 01:24:17,920
- Had nothin' to do with me?
- No.

1264
01:24:18,023 --> 01:24:21,754
Who'd it have somethin' to do with-- 
Vickie?

1265
01:24:22,394 --> 01:24:25,295
I just explained the whole thing to you, 
didn't I?

1266
01:24:25,397 --> 01:24:27,388
- Yeah.
- It was between me and Salvy.

1267
01:24:27,499 --> 01:24:30,900
If it had anything to do with you and Vickie, 
I woulda told you about it.

1268
01:24:34,173 --> 01:24:35,800
That's not what I heard, Joe.

1269
01:24:35,908 --> 01:24:37,398
What do you mean,
that's not what you heard?

1270
01:24:37,509 --> 01:24:39,477
- That's not what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

1271
01:24:39,578 --> 01:24:41,136
I heard some things.

1272
01:24:41,847 --> 01:24:44,441
- You heard about me and Salvy--
- I heard things, Joey.

1273
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:47,075
You heard that I cracked Salvy all around, 
what'd you hear?

1274
01:24:47,186 --> 01:24:49,086
- I heard things.
- What things you heard?

1275
01:24:49,188 --> 01:24:50,280
I heard some things.

1276
01:24:50,389 --> 01:24:52,880
You heard things. You wanna worry?
Don't start that shit.

1277
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:54,424
You know what you should worry about?

1278
01:24:54,526 --> 01:24:57,586
Worry you got this title fight next month.
That's what you should worry about.

1279
01:24:58,497 --> 01:24:59,623
Do that.

1280
01:25:03,402 --> 01:25:04,528
Christ!

1281
01:25:09,408 --> 01:25:11,808
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

1282
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:13,502
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

1283
01:25:15,447 --> 01:25:17,881
Hey, Jack, don't start your shit.

1284
01:25:17,983 --> 01:25:19,951
- No, really, don't start.
- Joey, I asked ya.

1285
01:25:20,052 --> 01:25:23,112
- Didn't I ask ya to keep an eye on her?
- And I did keep an eye on her.

1286
01:25:23,222 --> 01:25:24,655
Then how come ya gave him a beatin'?

1287
01:25:24,757 --> 01:25:27,055
I told you that.
I told you what that was all about.

1288
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:28,786
Didn't have nothin' to do with you.

1289
01:25:28,894 --> 01:25:31,829
- He thinks he's a wiseguy--
- Joey, don't lie to me.

1290
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:33,955
- I'm not lyin'.
- What do I look like to you?

1291
01:25:34,066 --> 01:25:35,624
Hey, I'm your brother.

1292
01:25:35,734 --> 01:25:37,793
You're supposed to believe me.
Don't you trust me?

1293
01:25:37,903 --> 01:25:39,393
- No, I don't.
- You don't? That's nice.

1294
01:25:39,505 --> 01:25:42,440
I don't trust you when it comes to her.
I don't trust nobody.

1295
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:47,640
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you exactly what happened.

1296
01:25:47,746 --> 01:25:50,180
He got out of line,
I slapped him around.

1297
01:25:50,282 --> 01:25:53,046
Tommy straightened it all out,
and it's all over.

1298
01:25:59,024 --> 01:26:00,855
You give me that look, Joey.

1299
01:26:03,729 --> 01:26:06,527
I gotta accept your answer, you know?

1300
01:26:06,632 --> 01:26:08,600
But I'm tellin' ya now,
if I hear anything,

1301
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,362
I swear on our mother,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

1302
01:26:12,371 --> 01:26:15,738
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- Well, go ahead and kill everybody!

1303
01:26:15,841 --> 01:26:17,274
You're the tough guy, go kill people.

1304
01:26:17,376 --> 01:26:19,674
Kill Vickie, kill Salvy,
kill Tommy Como,

1305
01:26:19,778 --> 01:26:21,643
kill me, while you're at it,
what do I care?

1306
01:26:21,747 --> 01:26:24,580
You're killin' yourself, 
the way you eat, ya fat fuck!

1307
01:26:24,683 --> 01:26:26,583
- Look at ya!
- What do you mean?

1308
01:26:26,685 --> 01:26:28,585
I don't understand,
what do you mean, kill you?

1309
01:26:28,687 --> 01:26:32,783
Me, kill me! Start here!
Kill me first, do me a fuckin' favor!

1310
01:26:32,891 --> 01:26:34,916
'Cause you're drivin' me crazy!

1311
01:26:35,027 --> 01:26:37,962
You're a killer, you're a big shot.
Just kill, you're a killer.

1312
01:26:38,063 --> 01:26:40,293
Excuse me, what do you mean 
by you, though?

1313
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:43,232
So? What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.

1314
01:26:43,335 --> 01:26:45,769
Even you don't know
what you meant by you.

1315
01:26:45,871 --> 01:26:48,396
- Don't mean nothin'.
- Joey, that meant somethin'.

1316
01:26:48,507 --> 01:26:50,907
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
you mentioned you--

1317
01:26:51,009 --> 01:26:52,442
you included you with them.

1318
01:26:52,978 --> 01:26:55,970
You coulda said anybody,
but you said you and them.

1319
01:26:57,015 --> 01:26:59,483
You really let this girl ruin your life, 
look at ya.

1320
01:26:59,585 --> 01:27:02,486
She really did some job on ya,
ya know how fuckin' nuts you are?

1321
01:27:02,588 --> 01:27:05,113
- Look what she did to you!
- You fuck my wife?

1322
01:27:05,257 --> 01:27:07,191
- What?!
- You fuck my wife?

1323
01:27:10,863 --> 01:27:12,626
How could you ask me 
a question like that?

1324
01:27:12,731 --> 01:27:14,631
How could you ask me?
I'm your brother.

1325
01:27:14,733 --> 01:27:16,701
You ask me that?

1326
01:27:17,569 --> 01:27:20,367
Where do you get your balls 
big enough to ask me that?

1327
01:27:24,142 --> 01:27:25,439
Just tell me.

1328
01:27:30,382 --> 01:27:32,145
I'm not answerin' it.

1329
01:27:32,251 --> 01:27:34,412
I'm not gonna answer that,
it's stupid.

1330
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:40,219
You're very smart, Joey.

1331
01:27:42,494 --> 01:27:45,793
You're givin' me all these answers,
but you ain't givin' me the right answer.

1332
01:27:48,734 --> 01:27:50,258
I'm gonna ask ya again.

1333
01:27:53,005 --> 01:27:54,768
Did you or did you not?

1334
01:27:55,941 --> 01:27:57,374
I'm not gonna answer.

1335
01:27:57,476 --> 01:27:59,410
That's a sick question,
you're a sick fuck,

1336
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:01,570
and I'm not that sick
that I'm gonna answer it.

1337
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,978
I'm not tellin' ya anything.
I'm gonna leave.

1338
01:28:04,082 --> 01:28:07,051
If Lenore calls, tell her I went home.
I'm not stayin' in this nuthouse with ya.

1339
01:28:07,152 --> 01:28:09,279
You're a sick bastard--
I feel sorry for ya, I really do.

1340
01:28:09,388 --> 01:28:10,446
You know what you should do?

1341
01:28:10,555 --> 01:28:13,149
Try a little more fuckin'
and a little less eatin'.

1342
01:28:13,258 --> 01:28:15,419
You won't have troubles upstairs 
in your bedroom,

1343
01:28:15,527 --> 01:28:17,654
and you won't pick it out on me 
and everybody else.

1344
01:28:17,763 --> 01:28:20,857
Ya understand, ya fuckin' wacko?
You're crackin' up.

1345
01:28:22,701 --> 01:28:24,669
Fuckin' screwball, ya.

1346
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:09,807
Where were ya?

1347
01:29:09,915 --> 01:29:11,280
I was at my sister's.

1348
01:29:11,383 --> 01:29:13,044
Where'd you go after that?

1349
01:29:14,419 --> 01:29:17,115
- To the movies.
- Yeah, what'd you see?

1350
01:29:19,191 --> 01:29:20,783
<i>Father of the Bride.</i>

1351
01:29:26,698 --> 01:29:29,166
How come you didn't tell me 
about the Copa?

1352
01:29:31,703 --> 01:29:34,171
- Tell you what about it?
- You know.

1353
01:29:34,873 --> 01:29:36,898
How come you didn't tell me about it?

1354
01:29:38,143 --> 01:29:40,270
Why didn't you tell me about it, huh?

1355
01:29:40,379 --> 01:29:42,347
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

1356
01:29:43,815 --> 01:29:46,716
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you fuck my brother?

1357
01:29:46,818 --> 01:29:49,252
- Get off me, you fat pig!
- Did you? Did you?

1358
01:29:49,354 --> 01:29:50,651
- Huh?
- No!

1359
01:29:57,562 --> 01:29:58,586
Open the door.

1360
01:29:58,697 --> 01:30:00,324
- Get away!
- Come on, open the door.

1361
01:30:00,432 --> 01:30:02,832
- I wanna talk to you.
- Get away from me, you're sick!

1362
01:30:02,934 --> 01:30:05,494
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Why'd you fuck Joey?

1363
01:30:05,604 --> 01:30:06,901
- Get away!
- Open the door.

1364
01:30:07,005 --> 01:30:08,131
No.

1365
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:13,705
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it, huh?

1366
01:30:14,146 --> 01:30:15,477
I didn't do anything!

1367
01:30:17,682 --> 01:30:20,651
- Why did you fuck them?
- Do what? I didn't do anything?!

1368
01:30:20,752 --> 01:30:21,741
I fucked all of 'em!

1369
01:30:21,853 --> 01:30:23,980
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you mean, who'd you fuck?

1370
01:30:24,089 --> 01:30:26,649
I fucked all of 'em-- 
Tommy, Salvy, your brother, all of 'em!

1371
01:30:26,758 --> 01:30:29,420
I sucked your brother's cock!
What do you want me to say?!

1372
01:30:30,529 --> 01:30:32,326
- You sucked his cock?
- I sucked his cock,

1373
01:30:32,431 --> 01:30:34,262
and everybody else on the fuckin' street.

1374
01:30:34,366 --> 01:30:37,426
What do you want? You're nothin'
but a fat pig, selfish fool!

1375
01:30:39,037 --> 01:30:40,504
Forget fuckin' with you!

1376
01:30:45,043 --> 01:30:48,308
His fuckin' cock's bigger than yours, too!

1377
01:30:49,714 --> 01:30:51,375
Where you goin'?

1378
01:30:51,483 --> 01:30:54,043
Where are you goin', you bastard?

1379
01:30:54,152 --> 01:30:56,017
You sick animal!
Where you goin'?

1380
01:30:56,121 --> 01:31:00,023
Let me go! 
Get off of me, ya piece of shit!

1381
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:02,616
If I see you put your hands
in that plate one more time,

1382
01:31:02,727 --> 01:31:04,627
I'm gonna stab you with this knife, 
ya hear me?

1383
01:31:04,729 --> 01:31:07,357
I told ya, keep your hands
outta the plate!

1384
01:31:08,667 --> 01:31:11,500
Why can't we eat in peace around here? 
Just relax.

1385
01:31:11,603 --> 01:31:13,537
Do I have to eat like you?
Like a <i>gavone</i>, like--

1386
01:31:13,638 --> 01:31:16,869
Jack! Jack!
What's the matter with you?!

1387
01:31:16,975 --> 01:31:18,408
Ya fucked my wife, huh?!

1388
01:31:22,347 --> 01:31:23,541
Get off of him!

1389
01:31:26,251 --> 01:31:29,914
- I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!
- Stop it, he didn't do it!

1390
01:31:32,357 --> 01:31:34,086
Call the police!

1391
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:38,128
I'll fuckin' kill ya!

1392
01:31:40,332 --> 01:31:41,458
Get out!

1393
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,511
Don't leave, honey, please.

1394
01:33:09,888 --> 01:33:13,756
Honey, look-- I'm a bum without you 
and the kids, don't go.

1395
01:33:31,876 --> 01:33:32,968
Just...

1396
01:33:54,132 --> 01:33:56,692
<i>Less than a minute to go,
and La Motta is losing the title</i>

1397
01:33:56,801 --> 01:33:59,031
<i>that he won from the gallant 
Marcel Cerdan.</i>

1398
01:33:59,137 --> 01:34:02,038
<i>After the tragic plane crash
that took Cerdan's life.</i>

1399
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:05,041
<i>Laurent Dauthuille vowed
to bring the title back to France.</i>

1400
01:34:05,143 --> 01:34:08,044
<i>Tonight, he only has to last
this fifteenth round</i>

1401
01:34:08,146 --> 01:34:10,774
<i>to be crowned the new 
Middleweight Champion.</i>

1402
01:34:11,483 --> 01:34:14,919
<i>La Motta is taking terrible punishment
on the ropes as Dauthuille bangs him</i>

1403
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:18,421
<i>with lefts and rights to the head.
Another left, another right to the jaw.</i>

1404
01:34:18,523 --> 01:34:21,014
<i>La Motta turns around,
he's been playing possum!</i>

1405
01:34:21,126 --> 01:34:23,788
<i>He's got Dauthuille hurt!
He rips a right hand to the body,</i>

1406
01:34:23,895 --> 01:34:26,659
<i>two left hooks to the jaw,
another left and a right to the head!</i>

1407
01:34:26,765 --> 01:34:29,063
<i>Dauthuille is reeling around the ring!</i>

1408
01:34:29,167 --> 01:34:31,431
<i>The tide has turned,
no question about it!</i>

1409
01:34:35,106 --> 01:34:38,303
<i>And he wobbles into the ropes
and goes down!</i>

1410
01:34:38,843 --> 01:34:41,641
<i>Dauthuille is down,
and referee Lou Handler comes over</i>

1411
01:34:41,746 --> 01:34:44,806
<i>and starts the count.
He's trying to get up.</i>

1412
01:34:44,916 --> 01:34:46,611
<i>Six... seven...</i>

1413
01:34:46,718 --> 01:34:50,210
<i>He'll never make it.
Nine... ten!</i> 

1414
01:34:50,322 --> 01:34:51,346
You're out!

1415
01:34:51,456 --> 01:34:52,787
<i>It is all over!</i>

1416
01:34:52,891 --> 01:34:55,018
<i>He is knocked out, and Jake La Motta,</i>

1417

<i>with 13 seconds left to go
in the final round,</i>

1418
01:34:57,929 --> 01:35:00,397
<i>has made one of the most
remarkable comebacks</i>

1419
01:35:00,498 --> 01:35:03,160
- <i>in all boxing history.</i>
- Jake La Motta!

1420
01:35:08,373 --> 01:35:09,499
Come on.

1421
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:12,506
Just tell him you're sorry,
you miss him.

1422
01:35:17,549 --> 01:35:20,677
He's your brother, 
you have to talk to him sooner or later.

1423
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,559
I'll dial him for you,
then you talk to him.

1424
01:35:30,662 --> 01:35:33,529
Just tell him you're sorry,
then you can say whatever you want.

1425
01:35:46,845 --> 01:35:47,971
Go ahead.

1426
01:35:59,357 --> 01:36:01,325
Hey, champ-- 
like to ask you a few questions.

1427
01:36:01,426 --> 01:36:03,826
- Not now.
- I been waitin' an hour for you.

1428
01:36:03,928 --> 01:36:06,556
- Excuse me, my wife is--
- There's a great angle here...

1429
01:36:06,664 --> 01:36:09,326
Don't bother me, please.
Get outta here.

1430
01:36:09,434 --> 01:36:10,662
Come on. All right, champ?

1431
01:36:10,769 --> 01:36:13,499
- You're a great guy.
- I asked you nice, will ya-- ?

1432
01:36:24,482 --> 01:36:25,608
<i>Hello?</i>

1433
01:36:32,323 --> 01:36:35,121
Salvy, this ain't funny anymore.

1434
01:36:35,226 --> 01:36:36,284
Is that you?

1435
01:36:36,394 --> 01:36:39,295
<i>I know somebody's there.
I can hear you breathin'.</i>

1436
01:36:39,831 --> 01:36:41,128
<i>You listenin'?</i>

1437
01:36:41,266 --> 01:36:46,033
<i>Your mother sucks fuckin' big 
fuckin' elephant dicks.</i>

1438
01:36:46,137 --> 01:36:47,604
<i>You got that?</i>

1439
01:37:36,221 --> 01:37:37,779
<i>The fight of the year.</i>

1440
01:37:37,889 --> 01:37:41,154
<i>The next time that friendly bartender says, 
"What'll you have?",</i>

1441
01:37:41,259 --> 01:37:44,228
<i>give him that answer the whole world gives, 
"Pabst Blue Ribbon."</i>

1442
01:37:47,665 --> 01:37:50,566
<i>Those punches by La Motta explain themselves.</i>

1443
01:37:50,668 --> 01:37:53,899
<i>They fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.</i>

1444
01:37:54,005 --> 01:37:58,840
<i>It has so far been a blazing bout
for the Middleweight Championship.</i>

1445
01:37:59,511 --> 01:38:02,878
<i>In that great action by La Motta,
he couldn't score the big one.</i>

1446
01:38:02,981 --> 01:38:05,108
That's it, that was his last shot. 

1447
01:38:07,352 --> 01:38:10,219
<i>Round number 13, the hard-luck number.</i>

1448
01:38:10,321 --> 01:38:11,913
<i>There's the buzzer,</i>

1449
01:38:12,023 --> 01:38:14,014
<i>and I think you know both the boys.</i>

1450
01:38:24,536 --> 01:38:27,198
<i>Robinson hurting La Motta,
he's hurting him now.</i>

1451
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:33,200
<i>He has La Motta on queer street, holding on.</i>

1452
01:38:33,878 --> 01:38:36,574
<i>Certainly, that was one
of the most damaging evidences</i>

1453
01:38:36,681 --> 01:38:39,514
<i>of punching that you have seen 
in recent years.</i>

1454
01:38:39,617 --> 01:38:41,346
Come on! Come on.

1455
01:38:46,658 --> 01:38:50,287
- What are you standin' there for?
- <i>Robinson, apparently tired,</i>

1456
01:38:50,395 --> 01:38:53,296
<i>punched with a "fare thee well",
and rocked Jake La Motta</i>

1457
01:38:53,398 --> 01:38:55,059
- <i>right to his heels.</i>
- Come on, Ray, come on!

1458
01:40:01,966 --> 01:40:03,831
<i>These are clean, whistling shots.</i>

1459
01:40:03,935 --> 01:40:06,631
<i>How he can survive them, nobody knows.</i>

1460
01:40:06,738 --> 01:40:08,968
<i>No man can endure this pummeling!</i>

1461
01:40:09,073 --> 01:40:11,837
<i>The fight is stopped on...</i>

1462
01:40:11,943 --> 01:40:14,673
<i>the signal to Frankie Sikora.</i>

1463
01:40:14,812 --> 01:40:17,747
<i>Row after row after row from the ring,</i>

1464
01:40:17,849 --> 01:40:19,373
<i>the crowd is standing and cheering,</i>

1465
01:40:19,484 --> 01:40:22,510
<i>as he just cannonaded Jake La Motta</i>

1466
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:25,646
- <i>into a death defeat.</i>
- Hey, Ray.

1467
01:40:25,757 --> 01:40:28,851
<i>And when I say that, 
I mean Jake wouldn't want to quit.</i>

1468
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,087
- <i>He wanted to go.</i>
- Hey, Ray.

1469
01:40:32,697 --> 01:40:34,221
Never went down, Ray.

1470
01:40:35,366 --> 01:40:37,334
You never got me down, Ray.

1471
01:40:38,202 --> 01:40:39,328
Ya hear me?

1472
01:40:40,004 --> 01:40:42,029
Never got me down.

1473
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,574
Yeah? See, look?

1474
01:40:44,676 --> 01:40:47,372
<i>And in the thirteenth round,
the hard-luck round,</i>

1475
01:40:47,478 --> 01:40:50,345
<i>the championship of the world
has changed hands.</i>

1476
01:40:51,215 --> 01:40:52,239
<i>And there you see it...</i>

1477
01:40:53,051 --> 01:40:55,519
<i>a champion gone down to defeat.</i>

1478
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,652
<i>And so, now we wait for the announcement</i>

1479
01:40:58,756 --> 01:41:02,692
<i>from Eddie Flint, the ring announcer.</i>

1480
01:41:03,394 --> 01:41:05,828
<i>Then we'll get up in the ring,

The winner by a technical knockout
in two minutes and four seconds

1488
01:41:25,349 --> 01:41:27,249
of the thirteenth round,

1489
01:41:27,351 --> 01:41:30,252
and the new World's Middleweight
Boxing Champion,

1490
01:41:30,354 --> 01:41:31,753
Sugar Ray Robinson!

1491
01:41:39,931 --> 01:41:41,296
Why are you pulling out
of Wednesday's fight?

1492
01:41:41,933 --> 01:41:44,163
It's over for me--
boxing's over for me.

1493
01:41:44,936 --> 01:41:46,028
I'm through.

1494
01:41:47,371 --> 01:41:48,998
I'm tired of worryin' about weight.

1495
01:41:49,107 --> 01:41:52,167
That's all I used to think about
was weight, weight, weight.

1496
01:41:52,276 --> 01:41:54,710
After a while, you realize
there are other things in life.

1497
01:41:54,812 --> 01:41:57,212
I'm very grateful.
Boxing's been good to me.

1498
01:41:57,315 --> 01:41:59,715
I got a nice house,
I got three great kids.

1499
01:42:00,118 --> 01:42:03,679
I got a wonderful, beautiful wife.
What more could I ask for?

1500
01:42:05,389 --> 01:42:07,880
- Hey, what's your name?
- Bob.

1501
01:42:07,992 --> 01:42:09,186
Take a picture, Bob.

1502
01:42:09,727 --> 01:42:11,957
Let him take a picture of ya, 
honey-- for us.

1503
01:42:12,063 --> 01:42:13,690
Go ahead, smile.

1504
01:42:15,933 --> 01:42:17,127
Thank you, Bob.

1505
01:42:17,235 --> 01:42:20,033
Take a picture of all of us.
Jackie, come here, sit over here.

1506
01:42:24,308 --> 01:42:26,606
All right, everybody, smile. Smile.

1507
01:42:29,313 --> 01:42:31,679
Mrs. La Motta, how do you feel
about Jake's retirement?

1508
01:42:31,783 --> 01:42:33,011
I think it's great.

1509
01:42:33,117 --> 01:42:35,449
He picked the right time to stop fightin'.

1510
01:42:35,553 --> 01:42:37,350
He's home with us all the time now.

1511
01:42:37,488 --> 01:42:39,581
- It's really good.
- You know what? You through?

1512
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:42,250
- Excuse me, you through?
- Yeah.

1513
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,521
I just bought a club on Collins Avenue.

1514
01:42:44,629 --> 01:42:47,860
It's a bar, package store, everything.
Guess what I'm gonna call it?

1515
01:42:47,965 --> 01:42:48,932
I don't know.

1516
01:42:49,033 --> 01:42:50,830
- What are you gonna call it?
- Take a guess.

1517
01:43:03,548 --> 01:43:05,345
All right, shut up.
Enough, enough.

1518
01:43:07,385 --> 01:43:08,374
Thank you.

1519
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:16,753
Just wanted to see what the microphone

1520
01:43:16,861 --> 01:43:19,227
on a sexy girl sounds like.

1521
01:43:26,671 --> 01:43:27,968
See how that sounds.

1522
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,507
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1523
01:43:30,608 --> 01:43:32,769
I haven't seen so many losers
since my last fight

1524
01:43:32,877 --> 01:43:34,344
at Madison Square Garden.

1525
01:43:37,014 --> 01:43:38,481
Okay, honey.

1526
01:43:39,684 --> 01:43:41,151
Thank you, doll.

1527
01:43:42,019 --> 01:43:44,146
- Isn't that somethin'?
- Bring us another drink.

1528
01:43:44,255 --> 01:43:45,882
- <i>Salute.</i>
- <i>Salute.</i>

1529
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:50,225
Look at this terrific girl.

1530
01:43:50,328 --> 01:43:52,660
She's the kinda girl 
you wanna bring home to your father,

1531
01:43:52,763 --> 01:43:55,061
especially if he's a degenerate.

1532
01:43:56,367 --> 01:43:57,493
Did I say that?

1533
01:43:59,837 --> 01:44:02,897
Nah, seriously, folks,
it's a thrill to be standing here

1534
01:44:03,007 --> 01:44:05,737
before all you wonderful people tonight.

1535
01:44:05,843 --> 01:44:08,141
In fact, it's a thrill to be standing.

1536
01:44:10,715 --> 01:44:13,741
If you believe it's a thrill to be standin'
before you wonderful people, then...

1537
01:44:13,851 --> 01:44:15,045
you're all full of shit.

1538
01:44:18,556 --> 01:44:20,922
By the way, me and my wife Vickie's 
gettin' married.

1539
01:44:21,025 --> 01:44:23,255
What am I talkin' about?
I'm out of it.

1540
01:44:25,496 --> 01:44:27,930
Is she here?
She's not here.

1541
01:44:28,032 --> 01:44:29,863
Vickie?
Nah, she's not here.

1542
01:44:29,967 --> 01:44:32,629
By the way, me and my wife Vickie's 
gonna celebrate--

1543
01:44:32,737 --> 01:44:35,205
it's a little different--
our 11th wedding anniversary.

1544
01:44:35,907 --> 01:44:37,534
Thank you.

1545
01:44:39,176 --> 01:44:40,871
That reminds me about two friends of mine.

1546
01:44:40,978 --> 01:44:42,878
One was married, one was single.

1547
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:45,380
The married guy tells the single guy,

1548
01:44:45,483 --> 01:44:47,212
"What's the matter with you?

1549
01:44:47,385 --> 01:44:49,478
"What's the matter with you?
Look at me, and look at you.

1550
01:44:49,587 --> 01:44:52,385
And look at me, and look at you."

1551
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:56,826
Let me get on with it.

1552
01:44:57,461 --> 01:44:59,520
"When I come home at night,
my wife's at the door

1553
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:01,063
"with a tall drink in her hand.

1554
01:45:01,165 --> 01:45:03,292
"Then she gives me a nice hot bath,

1555
01:45:03,401 --> 01:45:05,392
"then she gives me a nice rubdown,

1556
01:45:05,503 --> 01:45:07,403
"then she makes passionate love to me,

1557
01:45:07,505 --> 01:45:09,234
"and then she makes me a nice dinner.

1558
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:11,900
What more could you ask for?
You oughta try that."

1559
01:45:12,009 --> 01:45:14,534
The other friend says,
"Hey, that sounds great.

1560
01:45:14,645 --> 01:45:16,112
What time does your wife get home?"

1561
01:45:21,218 --> 01:45:24,449
I know I'm no Olivier,
but if he fought Sugar Ray,

1562
01:45:24,555 --> 01:45:26,113
he would say

1563
01:45:26,223 --> 01:45:29,351
that the thing ain't the ring,

1564
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,360
it's the play.

1565
01:45:32,163 --> 01:45:33,960
So give me a stage

1566
01:45:34,065 --> 01:45:36,363
where this bull here can rage,

1567
01:45:36,467 --> 01:45:38,367
and though I can fight,

1568
01:45:38,469 --> 01:45:40,869
I'd much rather hear myself recite.

1569
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:48,472
That's entertainment!

1570
01:46:12,503 --> 01:46:14,300
Jake, how have you been?

1571
01:46:16,374 --> 01:46:19,434
Hey!
You were just great.

1572
01:46:19,577 --> 01:46:22,102
It's a good thing Sugar Ray
wasn't here tonight, huh?

1573
01:46:22,213 --> 01:46:25,205
- He told that joke last week.
- Come on!

1574
01:46:25,316 --> 01:46:27,784
He repeats himself,
gettin' a little senile.

1575
01:46:28,586 --> 01:46:30,884
I'd like you to meet
State's Attorney Bronson.

1576
01:46:30,988 --> 01:46:33,115
- How are ya? Nice to meet you.
- And his wife.

1577
01:46:33,224 --> 01:46:34,657
- Nice to meet you.
- You shouldn't be here this week.

1578
01:46:34,759 --> 01:46:38,160
It's next week we got
the shakedown payments, right?

1579
01:46:39,463 --> 01:46:41,761
It's good seein' you.

1580
01:46:41,899 --> 01:46:43,127
That is a joke, right?

1581
01:46:43,234 --> 01:46:45,464
It's a joke--
only you know if it's a joke.

1582
01:46:45,569 --> 01:46:47,196
He's just kidding, right?

1583
01:46:47,738 --> 01:46:49,171
All right, we'll talk about it later.

1584
01:46:49,907 --> 01:46:52,034
- This is your wife?
- Yes, Mrs. Bronson.

1585
01:46:52,143 --> 01:46:53,940
Very pretty lady.
Charmed to meet you.

1586
01:46:54,045 --> 01:46:55,910
- Thank you.
- He's really a nice guy.

1587
01:46:56,013 --> 01:46:58,311
You can take a joke,
can't you, doll?

1588
01:47:00,451 --> 01:47:02,112
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1589
01:47:03,954 --> 01:47:06,980
Hey, Carlo? Carlo!

1590
01:47:07,858 --> 01:47:10,656
Give 'em another drink.
Somethin' happened over here.

1591
01:47:11,695 --> 01:47:14,255
- Darling, Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

1592
01:47:14,365 --> 01:47:15,662
- My wife?
- Yeah, why isn't she here?

1593
01:47:15,766 --> 01:47:17,324
What's it to you? 
You think I'm gonna bring her around here,

1594
01:47:17,435 --> 01:47:20,461
- let you bums get involved with her?
- Come on!

1595
01:47:20,571 --> 01:47:22,801
Especially the State's Attorney over here?

1596
01:47:22,907 --> 01:47:25,205
He comes here a lot, darling, 
watch him.

1597
01:47:25,309 --> 01:47:26,867
He knows I'm only kiddin'.

1598
01:47:26,977 --> 01:47:28,945
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.

1599
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:30,608
What's the problem?

1600
01:47:30,714 --> 01:47:31,738
There's really not a problem.

1601
01:47:31,849 --> 01:47:34,716
She doesn't look 21,
so I just had to ask for some I.D.

1602
01:47:35,252 --> 01:47:36,879
- How old are you, honey?
- Twenty-one.

1603
01:47:36,987 --> 01:47:38,284
- Twenty-one?
- Mm-hmm.

1604
01:47:38,823 --> 01:47:40,654
Can you prove that you're 21?

1605
01:47:40,758 --> 01:47:42,726
- Mm-hmm.
- Prove it to me.

1606
01:47:48,332 --> 01:47:51,733
Any girl that can kiss like that
can drink at my joint anytime.

1607
01:47:51,836 --> 01:47:53,133
What about you?
How old are you?

1608
01:47:53,237 --> 01:47:55,637
- Twenty-one.
- Can you prove that you're 21?

1609
01:47:55,739 --> 01:47:57,707
- Yes.
- Would you prove it to me?

1610
01:47:57,808 --> 01:47:59,105
Come here.

1611
01:48:11,188 --> 01:48:12,314
She's 21, too?

1612
01:48:13,357 --> 01:48:16,326
She has convinced me that she's 21, too.

1613
01:48:32,476 --> 01:48:34,808
- Watch it while I'm pouring.
- Your wife's outside.

1614
01:48:34,912 --> 01:48:37,380
- She's waitin' for you.
- Why don't ya tell me a little louder?

1615
01:48:51,228 --> 01:48:52,525
There.

1616
01:48:58,002 --> 01:48:59,128
Come on, Jake.

1617
01:49:05,509 --> 01:49:07,443
<i>Lonely nights</i>

1618
01:49:08,612 --> 01:49:11,445
<i>I'm so lonely</i>

1619
01:49:11,982 --> 01:49:14,280
<i>Please come home</i>

1620
01:49:14,385 --> 01:49:18,685
<i>You great big lump of sugar</i>

1621
01:49:19,223 --> 01:49:21,384
<i>I miss you so much</i>

1622
01:49:21,492 --> 01:49:23,323
<i>Please come home</i>

1623
01:49:23,427 --> 01:49:26,396
<i>Lonely nights</i>

1624
01:49:41,045 --> 01:49:43,513
It was a busy night last night.

1625
01:49:44,715 --> 01:49:47,343
- Everything all right?
- I'm leaving you, Jake.

1626
01:49:48,385 --> 01:49:50,876
- What else is new?
- No. I mean it this time.

1627
01:49:50,988 --> 01:49:53,286
I didn't wanna tell you
till I had everything worked out.

1628
01:49:56,060 --> 01:49:57,084
- Move over.
- Why?

1629
01:49:57,194 --> 01:49:59,685
- So you can put your hands on me?
- Open the door.

1630
01:49:59,797 --> 01:50:01,264
Come on, honey, open the door.

1631
01:50:01,365 --> 01:50:02,889
I got a lawyer,
we're gettin' a divorce

1632
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,934
and I'm gettin' custody of the kids.

1633
01:50:05,035 --> 01:50:08,061
- Let me in for a minute.
- No, I already made up my mind.

1634
01:50:08,606 --> 01:50:10,164
I'm leavin'. That's it.

1635
01:50:10,274 --> 01:50:12,902
Kids are gonna be with me,
and if you show your face around,

1636
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:14,307
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

1637
01:50:14,411 --> 01:50:16,845
- All right? That's it.
- Don't act that way, honey.

1638
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:45,103
Come on, champ.
Come on, wake up.

1639
01:50:45,209 --> 01:50:46,301
Wake up, champ.

1640
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:50,904
What's up?

1641
01:50:52,716 --> 01:50:55,617
- We're from the D.A.
- Yeah, I know where you're from.

1642
01:50:55,719 --> 01:50:58,017
- They wanna talk with you.
- Youse all look the same to me.

1643
01:50:58,122 --> 01:51:00,522
- What's the difference?
- They wanna talk with you.

1644
01:51:00,624 --> 01:51:02,592
- About what?
- I don't know, I don't run the joint.

1645
01:51:02,693 --> 01:51:05,093
- They just told me to bring you in.
- But what do youse want?

1646
01:51:05,195 --> 01:51:06,321
For what?

1647
01:51:10,234 --> 01:51:12,099
Do you recognize this girl?

1648
01:51:13,871 --> 01:51:15,168
She been in the club?

1649
01:51:18,676 --> 01:51:20,974
- This is the same girl?
- Yeah.

1650
01:51:22,613 --> 01:51:24,376
Nah, I don't know her.

1651
01:51:24,481 --> 01:51:26,642
She says you introduced her to some men.

1652
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:30,345
I introduced her to men. 
I introduce a lot of people to a lot of people.

1653
01:51:30,454 --> 01:51:34,754
You tell me I introduced her to men.
I introduced him to men.

1654
01:51:35,292 --> 01:51:36,919
But I don't say nothin'.

1655
01:51:37,027 --> 01:51:39,928
She's 14. 
Come on, put on your shoes, Jake.

1656
01:51:41,031 --> 01:51:42,862
- She's how old?
- Fourteen.

1657
01:51:42,966 --> 01:51:44,934
She's 14?
Let me see that.

1658
01:51:51,675 --> 01:51:53,199
Let me ask you somethin'.

1659
01:51:54,812 --> 01:51:57,440
You gonna tell me that girl looks 14?

1660
01:51:57,548 --> 01:51:59,675
- She's 14.
- I'm gonna ask you man to man.

1661
01:51:59,783 --> 01:52:02,911
What am I gonna say?
Come on, we gotta go.

1662
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:05,386
- We gotta go downtown?
- That's right.

1663
01:52:06,056 --> 01:52:08,024
For what, because of this girl?

1664
01:52:10,561 --> 01:52:12,688
- You drunk?
- Open the door, I'm out on bail.

1665
01:52:12,796 --> 01:52:15,629
I just gotta pick up one thing
and I'll leave, I promise.

1666
01:52:15,733 --> 01:52:17,428
- Kids are sleepin'.
- I won't bother them.

1667
01:52:17,534 --> 01:52:19,161
Let me just get somethin'.

1668
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:21,901
All right, don't make no noise.

1669
01:52:22,005 --> 01:52:22,994
- What?
- Don't make no noise.

1670
01:52:23,107 --> 01:52:25,234
I won't, I just gotta get this one thing.

1671
01:52:28,011 --> 01:52:30,172
- What are you doin'?
- I gotta get $10,000.

1672
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,180
My lawyer says if I can spread 10,000 around,

1673
01:52:32,282 --> 01:52:34,512
- I can get the case dropped.
- They don't have a case against you.

1674
01:52:34,618 --> 01:52:35,915
Oh, no?
You kiddin' me, or what?

1675
01:52:36,019 --> 01:52:38,317
You ever see a 14-year-old testify in court?

1676
01:52:40,858 --> 01:52:43,850
You saw the papers--
"La Motta Out on Vice Rap."

1677
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:46,293
- What are you doin' to the belt?
- What difference does it make?

1678
01:52:47,464 --> 01:52:49,125
Can't you get the money
from your friends?

1679
01:52:49,233 --> 01:52:50,700
Yeah, what friends?

1680
01:52:51,402 --> 01:52:53,996
You're gonna wake my kids up!

1681
01:52:54,104 --> 01:52:56,470
You're gonna wake the kids, stop it!

1682
01:53:03,881 --> 01:53:04,870
What's the matter with you?

1683
01:53:04,982 --> 01:53:07,473
Don't you put the dishes
so they don't fall down?

1684
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,677
What about the belt, Mr. La Motta?

1685
01:53:10,387 --> 01:53:12,617
Isn't that what you wanted to sell me, 
the championship belt?

1686
01:53:12,723 --> 01:53:15,692
- These are the jewels from the belt.
- But where's the belt?

1687
01:53:15,793 --> 01:53:18,887
The belt of a champion
is a very rare item.

1688
01:53:18,996 --> 01:53:21,897
I wish you'd come to me
in the first place, Mr. La Motta.

1689
01:53:21,999 --> 01:53:23,364
You'd have had the belt
and the jewels together--

1690
01:53:23,467 --> 01:53:24,900
Give me 2,000 for them.

1691
01:53:25,002 --> 01:53:27,300
- Give me 2,000.
- 1,500 top, that's all--

1692
01:53:27,404 --> 01:53:30,305
- You can't give me 2,000?
- 1,500 top, Mr. La Motta.

1693
01:53:30,407 --> 01:53:33,308
- I'm sorry. I'd lose--
- Give me them.

1694
01:53:33,844 --> 01:53:35,812
Don't tell me you're not 
gonna make a profit.

1695
01:53:35,913 --> 01:53:39,781
I know you're lyin'. Go around the corner,
I bet you I get twice what you're offerin'.

1696
01:53:41,185 --> 01:53:43,312
I can't raise the 10,000.

1697
01:53:44,521 --> 01:53:47,979
I tried, I tried.
I tried a lot of places.

1698
01:53:48,692 --> 01:53:50,159
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

1699
01:53:51,195 --> 01:53:54,164
If that's what they're gonna do,
they're gonna do it, what can I do?

1700
01:53:55,699 --> 01:53:58,463
Then fuck 'em, let 'em do
what they're gonna do.

1701
01:54:00,704 --> 01:54:03,332
Get in the goddamn cell,
now, come on!

1702
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:07,035
- That's right, can't hurt folks no more.
- This is where it's at right here.

1703
01:54:08,879 --> 01:54:11,439
Who was the one 
goddamn tryin' to shirk, huh?

1704
01:54:11,548 --> 01:54:13,846
- You'll pull your load here, boy.
- That's right.

1705
01:54:13,951 --> 01:54:18,285
- I don't want no more!
- Get in the goddamn box!

1706
01:54:18,388 --> 01:54:21,516
I'll break you on one of my fuckin' farms, 
you son of a bitch!

1707
01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:23,616
- Do you hear me?
- Go fuck yourself.

1708
01:54:23,727 --> 01:54:26,457
- Hold onto him just a minute!
- I got it.

1709
01:54:26,563 --> 01:54:28,030
See it? See it?!

1710
01:54:28,565 --> 01:54:31,193
Look at it, son!
Live in it!

1711
01:54:31,735 --> 01:54:33,862
Go on, boy, live in it!

1712
01:54:33,971 --> 01:54:36,769
- Do you understand that?
- On your mother's cunt, then!

1713
01:54:36,874 --> 01:54:38,000
Your mother's--!

1714
01:54:38,842 --> 01:54:40,901
- You cocksucker!
- Live in it!

1715
01:54:42,346 --> 01:54:46,305
Let that son of a bitch sit,
fuck him!

1716
01:54:46,683 --> 01:54:47,911
Fuck you!

1717
01:54:50,354 --> 01:54:51,981
Fuck your mother!

1718
01:55:28,992 --> 01:55:32,120
Dummy, dummy, dummy...

1719
01:55:38,835 --> 01:55:40,962
Why? Why? Why?

1720
01:56:00,524 --> 01:56:01,923
You motherfucker!

1721
01:56:14,204 --> 01:56:15,330
My hands!

1722
01:56:19,209 --> 01:56:20,437
Why'd you do it, why?

1723
01:56:20,544 --> 01:56:22,944
You're so stupid, you're so stupid,

1724
01:56:23,046 --> 01:56:25,446
you're so fuckin' stupid!

1725
01:56:25,549 --> 01:56:27,949
You're so stupid.

1726
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:30,884
They called me an animal.
I'm not an animal.

1727
01:56:30,988 --> 01:56:32,387
I'm not an animal.

1728
01:56:32,489 --> 01:56:36,892
Why do they treat me like this?
I'm not that bad. I'm not that bad.

1729
01:56:39,730 --> 01:56:41,698
I'm not that guy.

1730
01:56:59,683 --> 01:57:03,642
Guy comes home, finds his wife
in bed with another guy, the wife says,

1731
01:57:03,754 --> 01:57:06,689
"Look who's here-- big mouth.
Now the whole neighborhood will know."

1732
01:57:08,358 --> 01:57:11,327
Thanks. Thanks for laughin'.
Spread it around a little bit.

1733
01:57:12,863 --> 01:57:15,263
The first night I was here,
I said to the owner of the joint,

1734
01:57:15,365 --> 01:57:18,334
I said, "Listen, where's the toilet?"

1735
01:57:18,435 --> 01:57:19,902
He said, "You're in it."

1736
01:57:21,038 --> 01:57:23,029
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1737
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,131
Why don't you leave me alone?
I'm tryin' to do my routine.

1738
01:57:25,242 --> 01:57:26,231
Up yours.

1739
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:30,040
Pal, you're gonna force me
to make a comeback.

1740
01:57:30,147 --> 01:57:32,775
- Funny.
- Fuck you...

1741
01:57:33,483 --> 01:57:35,280
And the horse you rode in on.

1742
01:57:37,154 --> 01:57:39,281
And the whole cavalry behind ya.

1743
01:57:40,157 --> 01:57:41,283
Funny man.

1744
01:57:41,992 --> 01:57:43,619
That's why I'm here.

1745
01:57:46,329 --> 01:57:47,626
Give him another drink.

1746
01:57:48,165 --> 01:57:49,632
Piss in it for me.

1747
01:57:51,835 --> 01:57:54,736
I'm now gonna introduce a woman
who's made a worldwide tour

1748
01:57:54,838 --> 01:57:57,807
with top billing and all that other bullshit 
where they all hated her.

1749
01:57:58,675 --> 01:58:00,404
And I want you all
to give her a warm welcome.

1750
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:02,671
I know you're all capable of it.

1751
01:58:02,779 --> 01:58:04,747
You look like a bunch of junkies.

1752
01:58:05,682 --> 01:58:08,981
Her name is Emma 48's.

1753
01:58:11,354 --> 01:58:13,982
Oh, yeah! Go get it!

1754
01:58:28,872 --> 01:58:30,066
Taxi!

1755
01:58:41,918 --> 01:58:43,078
Honey...

1756
01:58:44,554 --> 01:58:46,249
Listen, I'm gonna take a little walk.

1757
01:58:46,356 --> 01:58:48,881
I got a couple of things
I gotta take care of, all right?

1758
01:58:48,992 --> 01:58:50,687
- Will I see you later?
- Yeah, here.

1759
01:58:52,229 --> 01:58:54,026
- Take that, I'll be home later.
- Thank you.

1760
01:58:55,732 --> 01:58:57,029
Be careful.

1761
01:59:11,581 --> 01:59:12,980
Hey, what are you doin'?

1762
01:59:13,083 --> 01:59:14,345
Joey.

1763
01:59:17,821 --> 01:59:20,119
Come on, Joey.
Why don't you turn around?

1764
01:59:32,469 --> 01:59:34,198
Come on, Joey, turn around.

1765
01:59:34,304 --> 01:59:36,067
Hey, Joey, come on.

1766
01:59:49,219 --> 01:59:51,346
Come on, Joey?
What are you doin'?

1767
01:59:51,454 --> 01:59:54,548
Come on. 
What are you gettin' so angry about?

1768
01:59:54,658 --> 01:59:56,455
Come on, be friends.

1769
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:58,084
Come on, you're my brother.

1770
01:59:58,195 --> 01:59:59,685
- Be friends.
- I'm your brother?

1771
01:59:59,796 --> 02:00:02,424
Yeah, ya fuckin' bum.
Give me a break, come on.

1772
02:00:02,532 --> 02:00:03,624
- Kiss me.
- Come on, huh?

1773
02:00:03,733 --> 02:00:05,200
Give me a kiss, come on.

1774
02:00:05,735 --> 02:00:08,636
Wait, let me call my wife and kids.
Don't you want them to see the kiss?

1775
02:00:08,738 --> 02:00:12,196
You gonna forgive and forget?
It's a long time ago, forget about it.

1776
02:00:12,309 --> 02:00:13,776
Just give me a kiss, come on.

1777
02:00:14,578 --> 02:00:15,704
Come on.

1778
02:00:20,917 --> 02:00:23,477
You're my brother.
Come on.

1779
02:00:25,488 --> 02:00:26,955
Come on, give me a kiss.

1780
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,487
- What?
- Come on.

1781
02:00:33,029 --> 02:00:34,929
- How's everything, all right?
- Good.

1782
02:00:35,031 --> 02:00:36,999
- Everything's all right?
- Yeah.

1783
02:00:37,868 --> 02:00:39,836
- Family?
- All right.

1784
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,098
Come on.

1785
02:00:45,208 --> 02:00:47,176
You don't wanna do this here, come on.

1786
02:00:48,211 --> 02:00:50,679
Let me call you,
we'll get together in a couple days.

1787
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:52,748
- You'll call me?
- I will.

1788
02:00:53,383 --> 02:00:54,850
Don't forget.

1789
02:00:56,052 --> 02:00:58,350
- I'll call you.
- All right.

1790
02:01:09,799 --> 02:01:11,096
...won it legitimately... 

1791
02:01:12,736 --> 02:01:16,228
and nobody could take that
away from me, nobody.

1792
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:19,399
Some people aren't that lucky.

1793
02:01:20,744 --> 02:01:24,373
Like the one that Marlon Brando
played in <i>On the Waterfront</i>.

1794
02:01:24,481 --> 02:01:27,143
an up-and-comer
who's now a down-and-outer.

1795
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:29,150
You remember that scene
in the back of the car

1796
02:01:29,252 --> 02:01:31,846
with his brother Charley,
a small-time racket guy?

1797
02:01:31,955 --> 02:01:33,752
And it went somethin' like this.

1798
02:01:37,193 --> 02:01:39,821
"It wasn't him, Charley, it was you.

1799
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:43,090
"You remember that night at the Garden,
you came to my dressing room

1800
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:47,761
"and you said, 'Kid, this ain't your night.
We're goin' for the price on Wilson.'

1801
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:50,601
"Remember that?
'This ain't your night.'

1802
02:01:50,707 --> 02:01:52,004
"My night.

1803
02:01:52,542 --> 02:01:55,010
"I could've taken Wilson apart that night.

1804
02:01:55,111 --> 02:01:56,510
"So, what happens?

1805
02:01:56,613 --> 02:02:00,014
"He gets a title shot outdoors in the ballpark, 
and what do I get?

1806
02:02:00,116 --> 02:02:02,277
"A one-way ticket to palookaville.

1807
02:02:02,385 --> 02:02:05,616
"I was never no good
after that night, Charley.

1808
02:02:05,722 --> 02:02:09,556
"It was like a peak you reach,
and then it's downhill.

1809
02:02:11,394 --> 02:02:13,021
"It was you, Charley.

1810
02:02:13,730 --> 02:02:15,357
"You was my brother.

1811
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:18,367
"You should've looked out for me 
a little bit.

1812
02:02:18,902 --> 02:02:21,632
"You should've looked out for me 
just a little bit.

1813
02:02:21,738 --> 02:02:24,798
"You should've taken care of me 
just a little bit,

1814
02:02:24,908 --> 02:02:28,708
"instead of making me take them dives 
for the short-end money.

1815
02:02:29,245 --> 02:02:31,042
"You don't understand.

1816
02:02:31,748 --> 02:02:35,309
"I could've had class.
I could've been a contender.

1817
02:02:35,418 --> 02:02:40,253
"I could've been somebody, instead of a bum, 
which is what I am.

1818
02:02:40,357 --> 02:02:43,986
"Let's face it-- it was you, Charley.

1819
02:02:45,195 --> 02:02:47,823
- It was you, Charley."
- How you doin', Jake?

1820
02:02:48,365 --> 02:02:50,333
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1821
02:02:51,034 --> 02:02:52,831
- Ready?
- You got about five minutes.

1822
02:02:53,703 --> 02:02:55,102
- You need anything?
- No.

1823
02:02:55,205 --> 02:02:56,331
You sure?

1824
02:02:57,374 --> 02:02:58,500
I'm sure.

1825
02:03:02,879 --> 02:03:06,007
- A lot of people out there?
- Yeah, it's crowded.

1826
02:03:26,669 --> 02:03:28,296
Go get 'em, champ.

1827
02:03:38,348 --> 02:03:40,316
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...
