1
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,641
Hello.

2
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:03,001
How are you?

3
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:10,161
Are you going behind the bridge?

4
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,601
This bridge or the next one?

5
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:15,721
The next one, thank you.

6
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:34,361
Thank you.

7
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,561
What's that?

8
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:53,881
What you have mounted there.

9
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:58,041
This?

10
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,241
Is it an anti-theft device?

11
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,361
You could say that.

12
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:05,921
It looks like a fine piece of equipment.

13
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,241
Do you recognize it?

14
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,121
It's somewhat my department.

15
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,361
If I may say so,
it's a good idea to secure your vehicle.

16
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,801
I have a cousin, and the other day...
He had no idea what'd happened to him!

17
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,281
He goes out to work,

18
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,281
he sees that someone stole his wheels
and placed bricks instead!

19
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,401
What, which vehicle?

20
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,321
A Kia Pride, the poor guy!
Stealing the wheels of a caddy.

21
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,081
If I was this country's ruler,

22
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:41,201
I'd hang one or two
to calm the others

23
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,161
Hang them? And then what?
You're being a bit harsh.

24
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:52,161
Perhaps this person only did
this out of necessity.

25
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,121
What if he simply must've, do you hear!

26
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,161
Which necessity?
What are you talking about?

27
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:58,921
Perhaps he was in desperate need.

28
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:02,681
And those who get screwed by his stealing,
Aren't they in need?

29
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,521
What about me!

30
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:07,881
Is it a reason to steal from others
when you're broke?

31
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,881
She's funny!

32
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,601
If it happened to you,
what would you do?

33
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,361
Would you love it?

34
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:18,361
No, of course not!
I wouldn't like it if it happened to me.

35
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:21,641
But killing people is never
a solution.

36
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,321
I think you should look for the
roots of this misbehaving.

37
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:28,001
Alright, I said one or two...

38
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,201
We're not born criminals.

39
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,241
What're you trying to say?

40
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,801
If you lay down one or two,
the others will step in line.

41
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,841
I see, but you're wrong.

42
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,961
A crime occurs by an
interaction of circumstances.

43
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,521
Killing someone for stealing some wheels!

44
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,761
Do you realize what you're saying?

45
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,641
Recently, two guys were hung.

46
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,401
For less than that.

47
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,601
A few people more or less doesn't matter.

48
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:59,081
You should think carefully.

49
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,641
You don't have the slightest clue.

50
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,521
I know very well...

51
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:07,001
There have been hangings
for a racketeering fraud recently...

52
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,361
And what did it change?

53
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,641
I don't understand you, lady.

54
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,241
It didn't solve anything.

55
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,961
Lady, it's the law and the sharia
who decide on that.

56
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,601
If it hasn't been resolved then,
it must be because

57
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,961
the law hasn't been 
applied well enough.

58
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:28,761
So, you're all 
pumped up about nothing.

59
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,201
According to you, 
to fully implement the law

60
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,281
we have to argue
the number of executions?

61
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:40,041
We already have the world record
of hangings after China!

62
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:43,161
Have we learned our lesson?
I'm sure we have not.

63
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,161
I think you're quite a mouthful.

64
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,681
And you should do as I say
a little more often

65
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,561
The Parsian hospital, 
which direction is it?

66
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,281
Straight ahead.

67
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,201
Or you'll fall behind.

68
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,041
What do you mean, straight ahead?
The Parsian hospital, that's on Sadaat Abad.

69
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:01,561
Between Kaj and Farhang.

70
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,281
Do I turn around?

71
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:05,881
Yes, you have to go to Sadaat Abad.

72
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,761
Okay, fine.

73
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,961
Have you gotten it with 
a Kinder Surprise, your license?

74
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,761
Why?

75
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:15,041
Is it your taxi or what?

76
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,601
You don't even know how to
get to the Parsian hospital.

77
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:23,361
I always go straight ahead.

78
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:26,201
Are you sure you haven't
tricked us by any chance?

79
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,161
We walk there.

80
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:29,601
What's the story?

81
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:33,361
I understand well,
but since we're having this discussion.

82
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,121
I would like to ask you a question.

83
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,401
I'm listening

84
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:39,041
What is your job?

85
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:42,241
I don't see the connection.

86
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,761
Oh, but there is a connection;

87
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,441
When you're defending an idea,
it's out of belief...

88
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,081
Or a particular interest.

89
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,001
I would like to know
what your profession is.

90
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,481
And you? Interrogations aside,
what do you do?

91
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,081
If I tell you, will you tell me?

92
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,161
Sure, we'll see.

93
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,841
I am a teacher.

94
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,481
Come on, no kidding!

95
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:08,521
Probably like Mary Poppins,

96
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,721
Spending her time

97
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:12,961
keeping some brats busy

98
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,841
with entertainment.

99
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,601
I'd bet on that, anyway.

100
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,801
Fine! Now it's your turn.

101
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,161
I'm independent.

102
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,321
I'm going to tell you
in which branch I'm working...

103
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,961
Wait, I have to get out right here.

104
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:31,921
What do I owe you?

105
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:33,361
Nothing, it's fine.

106
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:36,561
Definitely...

107
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,521
You're definitely no taxi driver.

108
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,441
I've figured you out multiple times now.

109
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:46,281
Independent or not,
you must perform an activity.

110
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:49,001
I'm going to get out, then I'll tell you.

111
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,521
Do you want the truth, little lady?

112
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,761
Yes.

113
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,001
My specialty is pickpocketing.

114
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,201
Pickpocketing?

115
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,241
Yes.

116
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,041
But I don't steal from professors like
you, or from taxis like these guys.

117
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,161
It's those who have fallen so far they
steal tires from underneath a Pride,

118
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:11,361
they cannot fall any lower,
they are less than nothing.

119
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,881
Also, an advice!
Stop crying for them.

120
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:16,841
Good luck.

121
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,481
Unbelievable.

122
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,641
Where does he get off, that one?

123
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,841
Hello, how are you?

124
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,681
I'm arriving in ten minutes.

125
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,801
Yes, ten minutes.

126
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,281
I'm going to get out over there.

127
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,561
Here is fine?

128
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,721
Yes, thank you.

129
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,641
There you are.

130
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:44,281
Thank you.

131
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:04,401
Thank you for not taking
another passenger.

132
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,441
- Can I get in?
- I'm sorry.

133
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,761
M. Panahi, I've recognized you!

134
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,401
Regardless of the hat.

135
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,601
Do you mind if I come sit in the front?

136
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,521
Sure.

137
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,241
Thank you very much.

138
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,241
You're doing a film, right?

139
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:00,001
That man and that woman...

140
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,401
Can you take that one?
Thank you, to Shahran please.

141
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,761
They were actors, right?

142
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,041
Do you know how I figured it out?

143
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:13,761
That last thing he said 
was very much like

144
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,641
that sequence in 
the café from "Crimson Gold"

145
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,721
You, a taxi driver?
Don't fool me.

146
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:22,521
It's a job like any other.

147
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:26,321
It is, but it's not your job.

148
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,961
Don't you recognize me?

149
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,361
I seem to have forgotten.

150
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:37,681
It's me, Omid.

151
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,161
Omid who?

152
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,321
Omid, the film delivery guy!

153
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,201
I delivered those DVD's to you!

154
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,641
To your son, to be precise.

155
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,921
More than once even, you were there.

156
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,961
I asked you how you were doing.
You said: "I'm fine, lad."

157
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,401
You asked me to get you
"Once Upon A Time In Anatolia".

158
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,641
No sooner said than done.

159
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,801
Why are you sweating so much?

160
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,841
It's very hot.

161
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:10,481
Guess which other film you wanted.

162
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,521
I don't recall.

163
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,601
"Midnight in Paris", from Woody Allen.

164
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,881
- Ah, that was you.
- Absolutely!

165
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,761
It's not out yet, this one.

166
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,281
And that isn't even everything...

167
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:43,201
I can get even get you footage
from ungoing productions.

168
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,561
Hello. I'll call you back.

169
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:05,441
Open the door!

170
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,241
Hospital Chamran.

171
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,841
No, you can better go to Milad.

172
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,881
He doesn't have any money, the poor guy.

173
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:19,441
Where is it? How should we drive?

174
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:25,001
Go quickly, please!

175
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,241
What happened?

176
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:27,841
There's been an accident.

177
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,961
I'm dying...

178
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,961
A motorcycle accident.

179
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:37,161
It's not my fault.

180
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:40,241
I told you to keep your helmet on.

181
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,921
Paper, please...

182
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,121
Not a paper towel,
some paper so I can write my will.

183
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:59,041
Driver, take some paper and
write down what I tell you.

184
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,121
What does he want?

185
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,241
Write down what I tell you.

186
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:05,921
My wife doesn't understand.

187
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,641
According to the law,
she will inherit nothing.

188
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:12,521
A few turkeys at most.

189
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,601
She'll end up on the street.

190
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:20,521
Hurry up, please.

191
00:13:20,721 --> 00:13:23,081
A mobile phone, do you have one?

192
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,361
No, not to make a phonecall.

193
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,121
I want the camera.

194
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:31,321
On me.

195
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,201
I don't any battery left.

196
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:42,481
The camera...

197
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,881
Turn it towards me.

198
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,521
Film me.

199
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,761
In the name of the great Allah...

200
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,041
I am Mohammad Rabei,

201
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,321
born in Ramhormoz.

202
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:02,641
ID card number 508,

203
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,961
Issued in the same city.

204
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,641
Stop crying, they can't hear me like this.

205
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:10,441
Son of Amin,

206
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:14,241
Healthy in body and mind,
I leave to my wife

207
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,841
My house at Ghale Hassan Khan,

208
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,801
Bahar, rue Izadi, number 34,

209
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:25,161
and all my possesions.

210
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:29,601
May God forgive me.

211
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,681
I ask of all my brothers,
to leave my wife alone.

212
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,721
Do not conspire against her,

213
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,561
and respect my final wish

214
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,041
To leave her alone.

215
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:44,681
This will...

216
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,641
must not fall into their hands.

217
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,921
Let her guard it.

218
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,321
There is no other God than Allah.

219
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,721
Get him out.

220
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,161
Help me, hold there.

221
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,321
It's not worth it, take leave!

222
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,881
Wait.

223
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,081
Give me the will please, mister.

224
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,401
I will give it to you later.

225
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,241
Take my card, call me.

226
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,201
The ambulance is here, let's go.

227
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,761
There.

228
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,401
He's dead?

229
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,561
He'll be fine, it was mostly fear.

230
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,321
He was looking really bad.

231
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,881
His eyes were closed.

232
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,401
Yes, it's me.

233
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,121
Is it you?

234
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,041
No, madam.

235
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:19,121
Rest assured, this is my real number.

236
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:22,201
Of course.

237
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:26,041
I'll call you as soon as possible.

238
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,921
Goodbye.

239
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:32,681
Was that her?

240
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,801
The husband died?

241
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,121
She wanted some certainty.

242
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,081
She was verifying if this
was really my phone number.

243
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,041
You believe I really don't realize
that was all staged, do you?

244
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:54,961
An empty battery.

245
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:58,481
Can I use your phone?

246
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,401
Thank you.

247
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,561
I'll unlock it.

248
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,241
Hello, I'll be there in ten minutes.

249
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:17,281
I assure you. Something'd come up.

250
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,161
I know, but this time it's true.

251
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,521
Alright...

252
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:25,361
I'll be there in ten minutes.

253
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,041
Why, thank you.

254
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,041
It's in the sixth street.

255
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:57,241
Fourth...

256
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,121
The next one on the left.

257
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:19,121
It's at the end of the impasse.

258
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,361
You can park next to the white car.

259
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,001
Can you open the door?

260
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,641
Yes, hello.

261
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,601
Is this the taxi driver?

262
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,441
Yes, I'm listening.

263
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:04,561
I had an accident with my husband.
You brought us to the hospital.

264
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,201
Yes, I recognized your voice.

265
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:10,241
Have you changed your number?

266
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,321
It's my husband's...

267
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,681
I wanted to tell you
that I'm in town,

268
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:20,761
To come recover it.

269
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:22,801
Recover what?

270
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:25,241
The film, of course.

271
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,641
But your husband is better, right?

272
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:29,321
Yes, he's better.

273
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:33,561
But we do not know what
the future holds.

274
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,401
I prefer to have it, just in case.

275
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,481
As soon as I've made a copy,
I'll call you. I Promise.

276
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,281
Don't call this number.

277
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,441
Call my cellphone.

278
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:49,521
Don't forget, I beg of you.

279
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:53,961
I won't forget.
Don't worry, I'll call you.

280
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:56,401
God bless you!

281
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,601
Hello, how are you doing?

282
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:19,361
Don't stay  here, go inside the mansion.

283
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,201
Thank you, here will do.

284
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,801
Take a look.

285
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,881
Go, he's one of us.

286
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:40,481
In the pile, there is season 5
of The Walking Dead.

287
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,001
No zombie movies.

288
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,561
- It's what you asked of me.
- It wasn't for me.

289
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,401
In any case, it's here.

290
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:50,921
There's 4 Hollywood blockbusters...

291
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,121
One with Mel Gibson...

292
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,041
No commercial movies.

293
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,481
Copyrighted movies?

294
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,041
Yes, what do you have?

295
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,241
I have a Kim Du...

296
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:01,521
Who's that?

297
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:02,761
The Korean!

298
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:07,161
I also have an old Kurosawa.

299
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,161
This is a rare one,
there aren't many copies.

300
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:11,801
Understood?

301
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,041
That one too, it's great.

302
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,961
Yes?

303
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,401
This must be a mistake.
Who are you looking for?

304
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,681
Hold on.

305
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,441
Omid, it's for you.

306
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,841
Who is it?

307
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,561
I don't know.

308
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:43,121
One moment.

309
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,641
Continue looking.

310
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:53,201
M. Panahi...

311
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,721
I'm astounded, I don't know...

312
00:22:57,921 --> 00:23:02,081
It's hard to believe that
you are associated to Omid.

313
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,001
- Who said we're associates?
- He did!

314
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,921
I saw most classics.

315
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,241
Are there any new films
I should take a look at?

316
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:19,881
Let's see!

317
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,921
Any film's worth seeing.

318
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,441
The rest is a matter of taste.

319
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,001
I welcome you to my home.

320
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,041
Thank you, that's kind.

321
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:34,401
This one.

322
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,201
And, that one.

323
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,361
Can I ask you something?

324
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,441
Yes, go ahead.

325
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:47,801
I study films,
and I have to make a short movie.

326
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:50,001
- Which department?
- Realisation.

327
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:51,721
- At college?
- Yes.

328
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,561
I'm looking for a good subject.

329
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,881
I've seen many films,
and read many novels.

330
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,001
But I can't seem to find a good subject.

331
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,361
Listen to me...

332
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:07,441
Those films have already been made,
those books have already been written.

333
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,361
You have to look elsewhere.

334
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,641
You won't find it by staying at home.

335
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,521
Where do I need to go?
What do I need to do?

336
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,081
That's the most difficult part.

337
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:21,161
No one can help you with that.

338
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,321
It's up to you to find it.

339
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:25,881
Thank you.

340
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,801
Thank you very much.

341
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:34,481
And?

342
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,641
I've taken these.

343
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:39,801
All those?

344
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,081
45 tomans.

345
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:53,841
I'll have The Big Bang Theory next week.

346
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,361
Fine!

347
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,481
Same time next week.

348
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,081
Too bad you didn't come in, next time.

349
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,321
Thank you.

350
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,601
Goodbye, good luck.

351
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,121
Since when are we associates?

352
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,841
ANNOUNCER: "Door not closed."

353
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:49,721
This is not mine.

354
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:53,881
Take us with you, please.

355
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,001
We're late, our taxi didn't arrive.

356
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,761
Where are you going?

357
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:00,561
Cheshmeh Ali.

358
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,121
Cheshmeh Ali...

359
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:06,841
- We're late.
- It's not on our way!

360
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,161
We haven't asked you.

361
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,481
Please, sir.

362
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,521
We have to be there at twelve.

363
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:13,241
Please take us.

364
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:16,961
I will take you there.
This gentleman is getting out further on.

365
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:17,841
One moment.

366
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,001
Go to the other side.
Let me grab my bag.

367
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,321
I hope we'll be on time.

368
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,881
Move over a little.

369
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:47,241
Be careful not to spill any water.

370
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:53,641
Be glad that we ran into this.
You're always groaning.

371
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,121
And if we don't arrive in time?

372
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,521
Of course we will.
Why wouldn't we make it?

373
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,761
I assure you...

374
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:04,601
That I didn't want to tell him that.

375
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,561
But usually, he buys around 3 films.

376
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,441
This time he took everything.

377
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:12,441
And that's because of you.

378
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,881
If you go with me to see my clients,

379
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,801
We'll bring the house down!

380
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,241
As a partner, then?

381
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:25,641
It's a cultural activity, what I do.

382
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,601
These films do not come out in Iran.

383
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,201
How can these college student
see them otherwise?

384
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:34,161
Your son, for example.

385
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,041
And even you!

386
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:38,721
Without me, say goodbye to Woody Allen!

387
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:43,961
It's just as at home.

388
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:47,121
I tell him: 
"Why do you lock yourself in the bathroom?"

389
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,161
Who is risking to come watch
your dream body?

390
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:54,921
You're much too relaxed.

391
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,121
When you're this calm,
it necessarily irritates the others.

392
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,761
- You're speaking about yourself?
- Of course.

393
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:04,441
You're always on edge.
I'm normal at least.

394
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,081
I'm fine just as I am.

395
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,681
My friend, I will ask you
to get out over there.

396
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:20,081
There?

397
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,241
Yes, you can find another taxi.

398
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:28,721
How much do I owe you?

399
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:33,281
Save it for your cultural activities,
it's okay.

400
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,121
- It's closed.
- I'll open it.

401
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:53,241
He won't let go.

402
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:55,601
M. Panahi...

403
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,681
I assure you, I wanted
to help you.

404
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,841
I did not mean to disrespect you.

405
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,881
I meant no harm.

406
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:06,521
Thank you, goodbye.

407
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,601
The time on the display is correct?

408
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:16,321
Let's see...

409
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:23,681
It's delayed by a few minutes.

410
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:26,161
When will we be at Cheshmeh Ali ?

411
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,441
It depends on the traffic.

412
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:33,961
Will we be there before twelve?

413
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,401
I hope so.

414
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,761
Even if there is traffic?

415
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:41,001
I don't know.

416
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,841
Accelerate and we'll be there in time,
God willing.

417
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,001
God willing? And then what?

418
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:50,721
We have to be there before twelve!

419
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,321
Excuse me...

420
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,841
People often go there in the afternoon,
why the hurry?

421
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,241
We're not going for fun,
it's very serious.

422
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:15,121
We must throw these fish into
the fountain at twelve precisely.

423
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,081
You don't seem to understand.

424
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,001
Our lives depend on it.

425
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,241
In the water at twelve, exact!

426
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:23,561
A matter of life and death.

427
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:37,521
The fish, they will die.

428
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:41,441
Sir, hurry!

429
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,681
Faster, they'll die.

431
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,081
Hurry, they're going to die!

432
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,881
Lift your foot.

433
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,041
They're dying.

434
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,521
Don't crush them.

435
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:02,641
Faster.

436
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,601
Go ahead, pour!

437
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:10,601
Quickly, put the fish in.

438
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,961
There's enough water!

439
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,801
Everything's fine.

440
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,641
A minute.

441
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,801
Is it dead?

442
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,761
A moment.

443
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:29,921
Pick up the pieces of glass.

444
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:42,521
He's just standing there watching us.

445
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:45,001
It's nothing.

446
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,441
The fish are fine.

447
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,721
Okay.

448
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,801
I beg your pardon, I'm sorry.

449
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,601
ANNOUNCER: "The number you called cannot
be reached, please try again later."

450
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,161
- Aren't they hurt?
- No.

451
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:30,361
I am really sorry.

452
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,521
I listened to you and I got distracted.

453
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:38,481
Why do ordinary fish
matter this much to you?

454
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:40,841
They aren't ordinary at all!

455
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,081
We've taken care of them for a year.

456
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,561
And after a year, you put
them back into the water?

457
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:51,121
Haven't you understood?

458
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:53,201
It's very simple.

459
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:56,121
We took them from the well of Chesmeh Ali.

460
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,801
We have been born five years apart,

461
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:01,121
but both at noon.

462
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,241
So, we have to put them into
the water at noon,

463
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:09,561
and take two new ones. Otherwise,
it's the end of us.

464
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,161
Dead, gone! Do you understand?

465
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,161
Do not talk about misfortune.

466
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,241
It's twelve or death.

467
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,441
Pardon me, I have to make a call.

468
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,481
I'll drop you off after the bridge.

469
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:36,441
I'll find you another cab.
He'll be faster.

470
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,521
We absolutely must...

471
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:41,961
Because I'll have to pick up
my niece from school.

472
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:43,921
Please, bring us!

473
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,001
We have to be there at twelve!

474
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:51,201
I would've liked to,
but she cannot go home alone.

475
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,761
We will never make it in time!

476
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,401
- What is he doing?
- No idea.

477
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:06,521
To hell with this incompetence.

478
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:09,521
He drives like a donky
and moreover, he is lost.

479
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,401
What is he doing?

480
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,881
I don't know at all.

481
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,201
Have mercy, we won't make it otherwise.

482
00:34:17,401 --> 00:34:20,841
He knows the way, it will go faster.

483
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:23,881
We'll never be there at twelve.

484
00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:27,721
I'm sorry.

485
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:30,081
What a moron!

486
00:34:38,281 --> 00:34:39,761
Thank you, goodbye.

487
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,321
You've come to pick me up
in this heap of garbage?

488
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,401
I've told everyone that
my uncle is a CEO!

489
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,761
They're going to say I'm a liar!
Think of my reputation!

490
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:27,041
You talk to me about discipline,

491
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,761
And you left me 
hanging around for an hour.

492
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:33,161
And there you are, 
bluntly staring at me.

493
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,921
I'm sorry, young lady.

494
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,481
By the way, hello.

495
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,441
Hello, don't change the subject.

496
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,241
What would you have done
if somebody abducted me?

497
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,361
Don't worry, 
I don't believe that would happen.

498
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,601
Nobody would have the nerve to do that.

499
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:49,521
Enter.

500
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:52,961
I have an appointment with an old friend.

501
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,681
And your pretty niece,
is she worth nothing?

502
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,081
I'll go.
I'll leave you to your appointment.

503
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:04,281
I'll find my way, like
the girl in The Mirror.

504
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,601
Am I going or not going?

505
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,481
As you wish.

506
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,841
You're defintely not funny.
It was such a joy for me to see you.

507
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,001
You arrive too late 
and now you go on, too bad!

508
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:19,601
I've already said I'm sorry.
Why are you making such a scene?

509
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:22,761
I'm joking.

510
00:37:22,961 --> 00:37:26,321
If I would've wanted to leave,
I wouldn't have waited.

511
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,001
Why did you turn off your cellphone?

512
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:30,641
Should I tell you the truth?

513
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,721
If you're capable of that for once.

514
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:36,641
When have I ever lied to you.

515
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:38,321
Go on, I'm listening.

516
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,801
I was sure you were going to call
me with lots of excuses

517
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:46,241
not to pick me up.

518
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:49,481
And what if I would've been worried?

519
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,801
I do like mom.

520
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,361
When you forget her,
she pretends to be sick...

521
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,881
And she doesn't reply to your calls.
You disembark all the time!

522
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,521
Hello, how are you?

523
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:27,041
It's me, Panahi.

524
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,441
I'm very sorry for the delay.

525
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,081
No, I'm coming.

526
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,881
Where are you?

527
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:51,841
Stay there,
I'll be there in a few minutes.

528
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,841
Stay there and wait for me.

529
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,041
I'll be there any moment now.

530
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:02,561
Did he think you were
going to let him down?

531
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:04,001
Never mind.

532
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:08,241
So, what did you want to talk about?

533
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:10,561
Not while we're driving.

534
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:14,161
Why not? We can discuss.

535
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:16,961
You're impossible, my poor uncle.

536
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,921
When you're out with a lady
as distinguished and cultivated as I,

537
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,321
One should first intive 
her to drink an ice coffee,

538
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,001
and only then should one
engage in conversation.

539
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,041
Alright, tell me what you want,

540
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,681
My cultivated and cultured ice coffee lady?

541
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,921
My film teacher has asked us...

542
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,041
to shoot a short movie
for the upcoming month.

543
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,321
I'm going to film you so I don't lose
any of your advice.

544
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,121
In other words, 
you're looking for a subject.

545
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:01,401
Bravo, you're smarting than you let on.

546
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,041
By the way...

547
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,121
The other day, mom was home
and we heard screaming.

548
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,281
It was the neighbours.

549
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:11,601
Something was going on at their house.

550
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:14,201
It was their daughter's suitor!

551
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:20,441
They'd put their 
daughter's suitor at the door?

552
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,801
The story, it was the girl that

553
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:24,641
fell in love with an Afghan man.

554
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:26,161
The father did not know.

555
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:29,681
When he came to ask her hand,
the father caught them.

556
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:33,681
He took him outside and
forbade his daughter to leave.

557
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:38,601
The guy stayed in the street all his days
just to get a glimpse of her.

558
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:42,561
The brothers of the girl went out
to intimidate him,

559
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:44,681
but he did not give up!

560
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:47,281
And then?

561
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,881
Finally, you're not going to be
to keen about this...

562
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,281
I've filmed everything.

563
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:57,161
You filmed everything.

564
00:40:57,361 --> 00:41:00,721
Absolutely, from A to Z.

565
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:06,281
So, then you already have your film.
Why are you looking for a topic?

566
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,441
Oh, come on!

567
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,441
You're a directer, you have to know
that this isn't broadcastable.

568
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:14,001
That it's not what?

569
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,041
Broad-cast-able.

570
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:20,001
All filmmakers know this. Don't you?

571
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,001
It's not possible.

572
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,201
Do you have the intention to distribute it?

573
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,481
Naturally.

574
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,121
At the school's National Film Festival.

575
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:35,241
Parents are invited to the screening,

576
00:41:35,441 --> 00:41:38,201
and a jury will select the best film.

577
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:42,321
And so, then we received an idea for
another movie, even more uneligible.

578
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,001
Tell me.

579
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,641
Yes, Arash.

580
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:03,481
I'm just turning on the bridge.

581
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:05,841
Where are you?

582
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:10,721
I'm dropping off Divist Dastgah.

583
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,241
The other side...

584
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,401
On the streetcorner...

585
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,881
The white vehicle, that's it?

586
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,441
That's it, I've seen you.
I'm coming.

587
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,721
Haven't you seen him for a long time?

588
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,921
Six or seven years.

589
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,081
Can I tell you something?

590
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:44,721
It doesn't look like a friend of yours.

591
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:49,681
His father was my Grandpa's friend.

592
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,161
They were our neighbours.

593
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,761
Enter.

594
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:06,921
So, lady Hana.

595
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,081
How are you?

596
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:09,921
Fine, thank you.

597
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,481
It's a hassle to see your uncle.

598
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,161
You see, he's forgotten his old coursins.

599
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:18,481
Not only does he never call,

600
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,441
he also doesn't return my calls ever.

601
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:24,081
Do you want a juicebox?

602
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,801
An orange juice, an ice-cream?

603
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:29,081
No, thank you.

604
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:32,081
She has her uncle's manners.

605
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:36,201
- An ice coffe maybe?
- I love that!

606
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:38,281
Let's go.

607
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,681
Sorry I didn't invite you in,
I wasn't alone.

608
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:53,721
I don't want anyone to know.

609
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:56,681
Have a look, I'll be back in a moment.

610
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:13,801
What is it?

611
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:17,481
Look, you'll understand.

612
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,561
He's weird, your friend.

613
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:49,281
He told me to leave my camera here.

614
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:51,441
Are you sure he's not going to kidnap me?

615
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:18,041
Do you want CD's?

616
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,841
I have al the new ones.
You can even test them!

617
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,921
I have a CD with
Andy, Shamaizadeh, Shahrokh...

618
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:31,841
I have another one with
Farhad Fardin, Mohamad Alizadeh...

619
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:35,401
It just came out.

620
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,281
They're both Iranien nationals
and foreign music.

621
00:46:38,481 --> 00:46:39,601
How much?

622
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:40,681
Just that.

623
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,281
2 tomans a piece.

624
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,761
There's two.

625
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,081
Have you seen?

626
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,281
Have you been hurt?

627
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:39,521
Not that bad.

628
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,521
When was it?

629
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:44,921
It's been about a month.

630
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,561
I recently employed video surveillance.

631
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,201
Can I look again?

632
00:47:50,761 --> 00:47:53,521
I'll show you the images
of the other camera.

633
00:47:57,761 --> 00:47:59,601
There, that's the woman.

634
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:02,521
And that, the man.

635
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,481
He hit me on the head.

636
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,401
That's his wife.

637
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,241
Was it a couple?

638
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,241
When he struck me to the wall and hit me,

639
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:19,321
the mask on his face slipped.

640
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,601
I've seen his eyes
and I had recognized him.

641
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:28,601
His face was familiar.

642
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:31,121
What did you do?

643
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,521
What could I do?

644
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:38,601
Have you reported him?

645
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,521
Why not?

646
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:43,761
It was just after...

647
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:48,041
All we heard about all the time was the
executions of those two racketeers.

648
00:48:48,441 --> 00:48:52,241
I did not have the heart.
I tried, but I could not.

649
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,801
That was something else entirely.

650
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:58,881
The racket had circulated pictures,
they wanted to mark the occasion.

651
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,081
It has nothing to do with your story.

652
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,841
It's not that.

653
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,601
I recognized them.

654
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:08,761
Both of them.

655
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:10,401
They're familiar to me.

656
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,841
Meanwhile,

657
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,401
I learned

658
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,961
they were desperate,

659
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,321
but with what they have stolen from me,

660
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,321
they were able to recover.

661
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,721
Knowing this, I could not

662
00:49:30,361 --> 00:49:31,761
go denounce them.

663
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:34,241
But when I see them, I'm furious.

664
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:36,841
I have a lump in my throat.

665
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,441
I thought it would
do me well to tell you.

666
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,961
And even if you, you cannot shoot it,

667
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,201
perhaps another filmmaker

668
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,441
can make a movie about it someday.

669
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:55,041
Hold these.

670
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:58,281
Something else?

671
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:08,201
It's him.

672
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,681
- Who?
- My attacker.

673
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,041
You should have told me before.

674
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:18,321
I wanted to see his face.

675
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,361
What for?

676
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:25,241
Just to see what a thief looks like.

677
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,201
Like you, like me,

678
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:32,561
like all the people around us.

679
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:47,081
How are you now?

680
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:49,441
Better.

681
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:51,961
I'm better.

682
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,601
Haven't you moved?

683
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:59,641
I'm always there.

684
00:51:00,401 --> 00:51:02,041
Faithful to the post.

685
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,961
I passed by once.

686
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,641
I didn't recognize our street.

687
00:51:12,841 --> 00:51:15,681
Everything had changed,
the houses were different.

688
00:51:15,881 --> 00:51:17,961
The people have also changed.

689
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,001
Only occasionally,
you meet a familiar face.

690
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,161
Everything changed.

691
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,921
Glad to see you again.

692
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,321
Thank you.

693
00:51:37,841 --> 00:51:40,001
- Thank you for your time.
- You're welcome.

694
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:44,681
- Need anything?
- No, thank you.

695
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:47,521
Tell Hana to return.

696
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:53,881
It was a pleasure.

697
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,041
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

698
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,201
Goodbye.

699
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,641
They were really friendly.
Especially those who served us.

700
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:51,681
Tell me,

701
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:53,361
What did he look like?

702
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,121
What do you mean?

703
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:57,601
He looked normal, like anyone else.

704
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:07,641
So, you want to make a publishable film?

705
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:12,481
Yes, I was going to read this to you
when you got the call.

706
00:53:26,321 --> 00:53:27,441
There we go.

707
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,161
The teacher told us
that to make a broadcastable film,

708
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:33,361
Are you filming or are you reading?

709
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,641
It's one or the other.

710
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,001
She told us that to
make a broadcastable film,

711
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,161
A film needs to have
the following rules:

712
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:50,801
Respect for the veil
and the Muslim decency,

713
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,161
no contact between man and woman,

714
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:55,281
no conspiracies,

715
00:53:55,481 --> 00:53:57,001
no violence,

716
00:53:57,281 --> 00:54:01,081
no tie for protagonists,

717
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,801
no Persian names for protagonists,

718
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:09,681
preferance for the first
names of Muslim prophets,

719
00:54:09,881 --> 00:54:12,241
usage of the sacred
names of the prophets,

720
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,801
Why aren't you listening?

721
00:54:16,881 --> 00:54:19,841
I'm listening, I was just thinking...

722
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:21,961
What about?

723
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:25,481
I was wondering...

724
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,441
what was going to happen

725
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:30,401
to my old neighbour.

726
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:33,641
Is it a positive or a negative character?

727
00:54:34,481 --> 00:54:36,601
He has a Persian name and a tie...

728
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:38,841
Oh you, that's in real life.

729
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,521
These rules, they're for films.

730
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,401
And what if he should become a
protagonist in a movie?

731
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,921
Then everything needs to be altered.

732
00:54:52,481 --> 00:54:54,641
Everything?

733
00:54:54,881 --> 00:54:57,601
He should firstly be given a Muslim name,

734
00:54:57,801 --> 00:54:59,761
his tie should be removed,

735
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,281
And also, he should have no beard.
It makes him a bit...

736
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,201
May I continue?

737
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,641
Go ahead.

738
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:13,361
Don't pose policital
or economical questions.

739
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,441
That's enough.

740
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:18,081
But no, it's not yet finished.

741
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:21,921
She told us to use our common sense,

742
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,441
to feel the smaller problems,

743
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,361
to masque our own.

744
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:30,641
"For you to see," she said.

745
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,481
My dear uncle,

746
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,241
listen...

747
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,961
Stay here,

748
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,041
I'll be back.

749
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,361
Are you going to the toilet?

750
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,841
No questions!

751
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,921
You're not coming out,

752
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,881
and you don't open
the door for anyone.

753
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,281
- "And you don't talk to strangers."
- What?

754
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:15,321
Nothing, I'm joking.
You don't have any humour.

755
00:57:58,961 --> 00:58:00,121
Hi!

756
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:03,401
Hey, you!

757
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:04,761
Come over here.

758
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,321
Yes, you!

759
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,161
No camera's.

760
00:58:12,361 --> 00:58:13,081
Come here.

761
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,921
Put your camera away.

762
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:20,841
I saw you take that!

763
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,681
What?

764
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:22,881
The money.

765
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:24,881
The money in the trash cans?

766
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,681
No, the money that fell
out of the groom's pocket.

767
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:30,681
Out of the groom's pocket?
I haven't seen anything.

768
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:33,361
I have seen it, and I filmed it too.

769
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,801
So what ? I do not care.
It fell.

770
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:39,401
I found it, now it's mine.

771
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,281
It is the groom who dropped it.

772
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:43,761
Listen to me, I have a month time

773
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:46,961
to make a broadcastable film.

774
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,641
If you take the money,
I won't be able to air it.

775
00:58:50,841 --> 00:58:53,121
Go give it back to him.

776
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:56,641
In exchange, I'll give you 5 tomans.

777
00:58:56,841 --> 00:58:58,601
Exchange 50 tomans for 5?

778
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,601
You must be stupid.

779
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:02,561
Don't worry about them.

780
00:59:02,761 --> 00:59:06,081
They're very wealthy, look at how much
they paid for clothing the couple.

781
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,081
I don't care about their money,

782
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:11,161
I want to make my film!

783
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:14,801
Go give the money back,
I won't forget about it.

784
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:18,041
Like this, you will be the
hero of my film.

785
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,921
Then it will be a movie
on the meaning of self-denial.

786
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,921
I beg of you.

787
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,281
What are you talking about?

788
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:29,921
I don't care about being your hero.
I want to give that money to my father.

789
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,761
Come on, please. Be a
little more sympathetic.

790
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:34,161
Do it for your mother.

791
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:35,801
I don't have a mother.

792
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:37,841
Even if you don't have
one anymore,

793
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,321
You must have loved her right?

794
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,281
Do it to make her happy.

795
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:46,321
Return the money, please.

796
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,881
Fine, you can go bring it...

797
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:55,321
No, it's up to you to do it.

798
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,201
You do it, and I'll film you!

799
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,641
Come on, please!

800
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:02,481
I beg of you.

801
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:20,481
Are you dumb or something?

802
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,041
Faster, they're leaving.

803
01:00:42,361 --> 01:00:44,001
Give it to them...

804
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:54,361
Go...

805
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:02,441
Come on, give it back to them!

806
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:42,641
What's wrong, what is it?

807
01:01:44,761 --> 01:01:46,121
Nothing.

808
01:02:14,281 --> 01:02:15,361
You don't want to tell me?

809
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,241
Out of the question.
I don't want to talk about it.

810
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,241
As you wish, young lady.

811
01:03:38,921 --> 01:03:40,041
Have you heard?

812
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,441
What?

813
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:44,521
The noise, outside...

814
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,401
I was holding my head down.
I haven't noticed anything.

815
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,161
I've seen nothing.

816
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:57,161
Look, there she is!

817
01:03:57,361 --> 01:03:58,481
Who is?

818
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,601
The flower lady!

819
01:04:00,801 --> 01:04:01,761
Where?

820
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:03,201
Can't you see her?

821
01:04:03,401 --> 01:04:07,161
The lady who always comes to see
you with a large bouquet of roses!

822
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,801
Good afternoon, get in.

823
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:22,841
Our very own Jafar Panahi, in person!

824
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,481
Where are you heading?

825
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:26,241
I'll call you back.

826
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:29,001
I'll take you.

827
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,241
Get in the front.

828
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:35,441
You already have a
young passenger here.

829
01:04:37,361 --> 01:04:38,361
Thank you, my love.

830
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,041
How are you?

831
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,761
Well, very well!

832
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,841
For you, my treasure.

833
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,081
Thank you.

834
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,441
Are you doing back there?

835
01:04:57,841 --> 01:05:01,001
What's going on?
What was that back there?

836
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:01,841
Where are you heading?

837
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,881
Are you the driver?
That's just the job for you...

838
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:10,641
Are you looking for someone?

839
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,801
I've heard a voice before seeing you.

840
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,601
The voice of a person who
I heard when I was imprisoned.

841
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,401
It often happens to my clients.

842
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,201
They focus on voices.

843
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:29,721
That's the effect of being blindfolded.

844
01:05:30,921 --> 01:05:32,761
The voice chasing you...

845
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:34,601
So, where may I take you?

846
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:36,081
To paradise!

847
01:05:36,321 --> 01:05:37,241
To paradise?

848
01:05:37,441 --> 01:05:39,881
I think I know a street...

849
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,401
Oh, that paradise?

850
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,361
Yes, that one.

851
01:05:45,961 --> 01:05:50,121
Unfortunately, I believe that
access is restricted to men.

852
01:05:50,921 --> 01:05:52,841
Seriously, where I you going?

853
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,401
I'm going to Vanak.

854
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,281
If it's on the way.
Otherwise, I won't bother you.

855
01:05:59,481 --> 01:06:00,961
Let me guess...

856
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:07,801
This is for someone who
has just been released.

857
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:10,081
Or, who has been arrested?

858
01:06:10,281 --> 01:06:11,761
Unfortunately...

859
01:06:11,961 --> 01:06:14,481
Ghoncheh Ghavami is imprisoned.

860
01:06:15,481 --> 01:06:17,201
The sports girl?

861
01:06:17,961 --> 01:06:19,601
Like, in your movie,

862
01:06:19,801 --> 01:06:21,321
"Offside".

863
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,841
She wanted to watch
a game of volleyball.

864
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,801
They were with a group of women,

865
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,601
that got arrested.

866
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:35,441
Everyone else got released,
except for her... Since 108 days.

867
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,001
Has she managed to go?

868
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,161
No, they were stopped
outside of the stadium.

869
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:48,001
She went on a hunger
strike ten days ago.

870
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,881
Her mother went to see her yesterday,

871
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:54,081
to try to convince her to stop.

872
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,761
I sent her a message,

873
01:06:55,961 --> 01:06:59,321
also begging to stop, while
also saying that I understood.

874
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,641
It's the same tactic we used,

875
01:07:02,841 --> 01:07:05,921
in that situation.

876
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,761
She acted like us.

877
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:13,921
So, her mother brings her food
in hope to convince her.

878
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,201
So, they took her to a
closed room with camera's.

879
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,561
to make her talk.

880
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,721
A television interview?

881
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:24,201
Exactly.

882
01:07:24,401 --> 01:07:28,801
They asked her to confirm that her
daughter never went on a hunger strike.

883
01:07:29,001 --> 01:07:30,961
She became furious,

884
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:35,081
And went out screaming,
thus she can no longer visit her.

885
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:37,321
She distanced herself from food afterwards.

886
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:41,921
They asked the same of Ghoncheh in her
cell, but in a written format:

887
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,201
"I have never been on a hunger strike"

888
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:49,561
She tore the paper apart,
and lost her guest priviliges.

889
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,961
That's the story.

890
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,041
I'm going to meet the family,

891
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,201
To see what we can do
for this girl,

892
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,641
that, after yesterday,
also stopped drinking.

893
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,281
We will try everything.

894
01:08:06,961 --> 01:08:07,841
What to do?

895
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:08,841
I see.

896
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,201
How is your husband?

897
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,121
He's fine, he's working.

898
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,401
Hasn't he forbidden you to exercise?

899
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:18,601
No.

900
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,881
I heard you were suspended,

901
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,601
for three years!

902
01:08:25,841 --> 01:08:29,841
It's official, the Disciplinary
Board,

903
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:31,841
have voted on my suspension.

904
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,321
I haven't had any prior notification.

905
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:37,481
So, for now... Nothing!

906
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,281
The decision isn't valid.

907
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,521
A disciplinary board, why?

908
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,201
I don't know.

909
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,121
Is it not possible to defend your own rights?

910
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:53,281
As if the film-makers union
would want your ban revoked.

911
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,961
What would you do?

912
01:08:57,961 --> 01:09:00,801
It's wet over here.
Who does this wallet belong to?

913
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:02,161
Show me.

914
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,041
There.

915
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:08,481
Look if you can find an
address inside.

916
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:11,521
Come on, you can't do that.

917
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:13,521
That's not the way to go...

918
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:16,521
Sorry, I forgot.

919
01:09:16,961 --> 01:09:20,761
In any case, whoever dropped it
wasn't a young person.

920
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,561
She's not my age, nor my mother's...

921
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:27,641
It's certain, she's an old one.

922
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:29,361
More like grandma's age?

923
01:09:29,561 --> 01:09:30,721
Indeed.

924
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,681
Then it must be from...

925
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:36,161
the ladies that wanted
to go to Cheshmeh Ali.

926
01:09:36,601 --> 01:09:38,401
Those were my latest passengers.

927
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:39,441
Cheshmeh Ali?

928
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,561
You have to find them,
that's your destination.

929
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:45,081
I'll drop you off first.

930
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,241
I'm going to get out here.

931
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:49,681
You have to go down Nawab street,

932
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,681
while I have to go the other way.

933
01:09:52,881 --> 01:09:54,601
These are opposite directions.

934
01:09:54,961 --> 01:09:57,601
Do what you have to do.

935
01:09:57,801 --> 01:10:00,481
That is for the love of film.

936
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:05,081
I put it there for the people of the cinema,
on whom you can always count.

937
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,481
Like you.

938
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:09,881
I put it there,

939
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,401
to show you
that I see what you're doing.

940
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,201
You know, Jafar.

941
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,481
They make sure,

942
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:21,041
that we know we're being monitored.

943
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,361
Their tactics are clear.

944
01:10:23,561 --> 01:10:25,721
They create a political record,

945
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:29,041
You become a target of Mossad,
the CIA, MI5.

946
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,961
Then, they'll add a sex scandal.

947
01:10:34,641 --> 01:10:36,641
They make your life a prison.

948
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,921
You go out, but the outside world,

949
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,441
Is nothing but an even larger prison.

950
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:46,241
They make your besr friends,
your worst enemies.

951
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:50,881
You will have to flee the country,

952
01:10:51,521 --> 01:10:55,081
Or leave you praying for a safe return.

953
01:10:55,801 --> 01:10:58,881
So there is nothing else to do:
Nothing to do!

954
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,201
Alright.

955
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,041
Do not put what I've just
said in your film.

956
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,841
If not,
you will be accused of conspiring.

957
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,321
Then, you will have even more problems.

958
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,761
Quickly, the light is green.

959
01:11:14,961 --> 01:11:17,161
Thank you, it was a pleasure!

960
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,641
Hurry!

961
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,841
Enter.

962
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,641
She's ingenious.

963
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,361
The flower lady?

964
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,521
By the way, what is it, conspiring?

965
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:48,841
You had it in your list earlier.

966
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,481
Yes, the teacher told us.

967
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:54,441
But I haven't understood.

968
01:11:54,641 --> 01:11:56,281
She explained it badly.

969
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,401
She said that you should only show reality.

970
01:11:59,601 --> 01:12:03,441
But when reality is complicated or ugly,

971
01:12:03,641 --> 01:12:05,641
one cannot show this.

972
01:12:05,841 --> 01:12:08,841
I do not understand
what to show or not,

973
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,201
what is supposed to be real or not.

974
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,081
I don't want to fail.

975
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,161
For example, everything
that the flower lady just said,

976
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,681
cannot be shown.

977
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,881
However, all she says is real.

978
01:12:28,921 --> 01:12:32,321
There are realities
they do not want to show.

979
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:36,761
They create them, but
they do not want to show them?

980
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:39,521
I don't understand.

981
01:12:42,641 --> 01:12:44,001
It's pretty, that flower.

982
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:22,401
I'll go see if they're here.

983
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,201
They're here.

984
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,321
- Where's the wallet?
- In my backpack.

985
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,001
- He's coming back!
- I don't have the memory card!

986
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,801
We'll get that later, let's go!

987
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:25,841
Taxi Teheran

988
01:17:28,801 --> 01:17:34,321
A film of Jafar Panahi

989
01:17:36,961 --> 01:17:39,121
The Ministry of Islamic Guidance

990
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:42,161
rates the quality
of "broadcastable" films.

991
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,881
To my regret,

992
