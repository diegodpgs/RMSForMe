1
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,110
Mind your step, Jenny.

2
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:45,413
Don't you worry none about me.
I can hold me gin.

3
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:48,386
I'm right as rain.

4
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,354
Ta-ta, love.

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,892
Mind how you go.

6
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,670
-Evening.
-Good evening.

7
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:49,315
-It's a raw night, isn't it?
-Yes. Raw.

8
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:56,850
-You'll ruin them fine clothes.
-Would you like this?

9
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:14,409
Come straight to the point,
don't you, love?

10
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,946
Well, my place is right along here.

11
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,218
No.

12
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,320
There.

13
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,434
We are in a hurry, aren't we?

14
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,904
Come on, then.

15
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:56,308
Come along.

16
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:08,195
Oh, right you are, sir.

17
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,662
Wouldn't want to break it.

18
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:17,305
Wow. That's lovely.

19
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:21,569
We got our own band.

20
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:27,272
Come on, then.

21
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:32,543
I'm hot and getting colder,
if you take my meaning.

22
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:37,992
-What's your name, dearie?
-John.

23
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,059
John.

24
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:42,825
John.

25
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,557
Oh, John.

26
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,604
Oh, John.

27
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:51,530
John.

28
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:53,998
John.

29
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,270
But my friends all call me Jack.

30
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:05,877
Will The Gazette continue
with your pieces on free love, H.G.?

31
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:11,019
Free love sells newspapers.
Gentleman, the Fleet Street Casanova.

32
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,949
Here, here.

33
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:16,148
I've got my little experiments
to pay for.

34
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:21,023
You're the hero of the working class.
Free love is all they can afford.

35
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,527
Oh, Lord.
Don't start him on socialism.

36
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:27,828
We'll have to listen
to a sermon on it.

37
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:33,065
Don't call it a sermon. You know
I don't believe in organized religion.

38
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:38,612
Socialism is the path man must tread
on the way to a utopian society.

39
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:43,445
We've heard all that. What's this
great announcement we're here for?

40
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,646
-A cure for gravity?
-I want to wait until we're all here.

41
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:49,916
Who's missing?

42
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:53,960
-Dr. Stevenson is here.
-Thank you. Send him in.

43
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,262
-Good evening, John.
-Herbert.

44
00:06:58,467 --> 00:06:59,934
-Good evening.
-Hello.

45
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:04,630
We'd begun to despair. Have you dined?
There's still roast beef.

46
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,971
Thank you, no. Perhaps a little brandy
to take away the chill.

47
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:14,013
I'm sorry I missed supper, but
a physician's hours are not his own.

48
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,514
-Gentlemen.
-Good health.

49
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,153
Cheers.

50
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,953
What has Herbert left for me tonight?

51
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:29,120
Chess must wait.
You're just in time for the surprise.

52
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:32,665
Isn't he, H.G.?
The great big whatever-it-is?

53
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,565
-Am I?
-I was waiting for you.

54
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,743
-I am all attention.
-Very well.

55
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:53,715
Gentlemen, I have called you here
tonight to bid you farewell.

56
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,948
-Farewell?
-Where are you going?

57
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,494
-Another holiday in Scotland?
-No. No, I am traveling...

58
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:07,897
...but I'm not leaving London.
I don't expect to leave my laboratory.

59
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,436
-Riddles again.
-Gentlemen.

60
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,939
I am talking about traveling
through time.

61
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:18,136
In a machine constructed
for that very purpose.

62
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,548
What?

63
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:24,419
-Poppycock.
-Why?

64
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:30,783
Electric light, courtesy of Edison,
a modern Prometheus.

65
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:36,021
Good heavens. You were really serious.

66
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:42,767
I don't believe it. You've actually
built the bloody thing.

67
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:46,066
-Free love paid for most of it.
-I've no doubt.

68
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,210
I didn't think practical jokes
was in your line.

69
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:54,315
Twelve years ago, an engineer used
the sun to power a printing press.

70
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,953
My time machine
uses the same power source.

71
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:02,716
-You can't be serious.
-This thing is propelled by sunshine?

72
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,860
This cup catches
the rays of the sun...

73
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,657
...converting its heat
to electricity here.

74
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:15,201
Electricity does the rest. Juxtaposing
fields of energy creating friction.

75
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:19,170
The result is an ever-increasing
series of reactions...

76
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:25,746
...that literally rotates the machine
out of one time sphere into another.

77
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:30,112
Cruising speed is two years per
minute. Go into the past or future.

78
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,986
Two years per minute?

79
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:36,591
Acceleration keeps the machine and
occupant outside all time spheres...

80
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:41,661
-...conscious, but vaporized.
-How do you determine direction?

81
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:45,857
West, you gain yesterdays.
East, you accumulate tomorrows.

82
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:49,162
Balderdash!
Go north, you get to Glasgow.

83
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:53,172
The machine is designed
with several safety features.

84
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:57,972
The reversal rotation lock returns
the machine to its starting date...

85
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,478
...after the completion of a voyage.

86
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,618
If the occupant is injured
during a flight...

87
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:08,313
...the passenger is returned
to the point of departure.

88
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:14,759
Unless he uses this key
to countermand the device.

89
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:18,092
Without that key,
it's a bloody homing pigeon.

90
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,929
And what, may I ask, is this?

91
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,137
Well, John...

92
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:31,945
...this is the vaporizing equalizer.

93
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:36,141
Without it, the passenger journeys
without the machine...

94
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:40,755
...and without the machine,
there is no coming back.

95
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,622
Well, H.G., which is it to be?
The past or the future?

96
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:52,392
The past, surely.
He'll want to meet Cleopatra.

97
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,331
-The future.
-Why the future?

98
00:10:55,538 --> 00:11:00,908
I belong there. In three generations,
social utopia will have come to pass.

99
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,878
There'll be no war, crime or poverty.
And no disease either, John.

100
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,849
Men will live like brothers,
and in equality with women.

101
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:14,819
-Oh, dear. Let's have the past.
-Here, here.

102
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:19,750
I can't agree with you. Check.

103
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:25,298
You astonish me. In the midst of all
your theorizing, you ignore the facts.

104
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:30,404
We live in a cosmic charnel house.
Mankind has not changed in 2000 years.

105
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,804
We hunt, we're hunted. That's
how it is. How it will always be.

106
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,907
The future will prove you wrong.

107
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,344
The future will tell.

108
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,743
Anyway, I have just one question
for myself. When do you leave?

109
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:51,424
-I'm not sure.
-Human frailty, at last.

110
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:54,022
Well, to be quite candid...

111
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,362
-...I haven't worked up the nerve.
-First time for that.

112
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:04,801
But I will. All I have to do is set
the date and activate the switches.

113
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,271
And I'll inherit the Hope diamond.

114
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:10,411
-Checkmate.
-How does he do it?

115
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,342
-Not again?
-Every time.

116
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:15,176
I know how he thinks. That's all.

117
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:20,151
-One day I shall win.
-When you learn how I think.

118
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:28,387
Sorry to interrupt. Two gentlemen from
Scotland Yard want a word with you.

119
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,263
What is the meaning of this?

120
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:38,736
Beg pardon, sir.
Might we have a word with you?

121
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,306
-The Ripper? In this vicinity?
-I'm afraid so, sir.

122
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,850
We've cordoned off the neighborhood.
We're asking for cooperation.

123
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:56,218
Will that be all right? Your
housekeeper will sleep better.

124
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,620
-By all means.
-Thank you, sir.

125
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:00,624
What's happened?

126
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,992
Apparently, the Ripper
has struck again.

127
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,261
-With your permission, sir.
-Please.

128
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,962
-He's not been heard from in years.
-Nor in this area.

129
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:16,736
No doubt about it, I'm afraid.
He has a very distinctive style.

130
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:20,507
-What have you there?
-You better look at this, sir.

131
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:26,516
-That's Dr. Stevenson's bag.
-That belongs to one of my guests.

132
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:33,351
-What's his name?
-John Leslie Stevenson.

133
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:39,762
-Chief surgeon at St. Bartholomew's--
-Also chief surgeon in White chapel.

134
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:59,553
-Nothing upstairs.
-All windows locked.

135
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,052
-Skylight?
-Closed.

136
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,657
-Checked the roof. No sign.
-In back?

137
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:07,920
A high brick wall.
He's not gone that way.

138
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,564
-He was with you just now?
-Yes.

139
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,826
He must have gone out the front,
as we came in.

140
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:18,905
It doesn't matter. We know who he is,
which is more than before tonight.

141
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:25,069
We'll round him up. If you come with
me, I'll see that you get home safe.

142
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,511
-There's bound to be an explanation.
-Beyond belief.

143
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:38,124
Thank you, dear. That's my umbrella.

144
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:46,925
I've never been so frightened. All the
times I've put that bag in the closet.

145
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:51,868
-I wonder he didn't take it with him.
-We'd never have known.

146
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:57,603
-He was always such a gentleman.
-Yes. A gentleman.

147
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:02,773
I wonder where he got to so fast.
The coppers searched high and low.

148
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,283
We were by the door the whole time.

149
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,514
If he fooled them this long,
no surprise he's done it again.

150
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:13,217
-What did you say?
-We were by the door the whole time.

151
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:23,067
When you learn how I think.

152
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,121
1979.

153
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:30,792
What have I done?

154
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,361
I've turned that bloody maniac
loose upon utopia.

155
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,971
-Mr. Wells--
-Bring me all the housekeeping money.

156
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:44,373
And any money you have of your own.
I'll make it up to you.

157
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,783
-How much?
-Fifteen pounds, sixpence.

158
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:28,082
-You want it all?
-All, if you please, Mrs. Turner.

159
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:34,826
-Something wrong, sir?
-Would you mind awfully?

160
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:40,091
Money may not answer.
I may have to trade with the natives.

161
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,690
Let me see. The key.

162
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:13,093
86 years. Two years per minute.
That makes 43 minutes.

163
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:16,430
Estimated time of arrival would be....

164
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,232
11:15.

165
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:21,734
Right.

166
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:26,844
Utopia.

167
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,841
Mr. Wells?

168
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,646
Mr. Wells?

169
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:44,509
--Lindbergh 's over the Irish coast--

170
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,221
--support of the woman I love--

171
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:53,952
--we have to fear is--

172
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:00,492
--their finest hour--

173
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,567
--attacked Pearl Harbor--

174
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,329
--I shall return--

175
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,234
--this is London--

176
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:12,110
--whose throat you'd like to cut--

177
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:17,613
--proclaim the state of Israel--

178
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:21,948
--Queen Elizabeth Il is crowned--

179
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:24,890
--from North Korea--

180
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,526
--Ask not--

181
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:28,787
--President Kennedy is dead--

182
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:30,988
--Martin Luther King--

183
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,827
--one small step for man--

184
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,303
--Israeli athletes were killed--

185
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:39,338
--Vietnam cease-fire agreement--

186
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,740
--because of Watergate--

187
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,377
--second test-tube baby--

188
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:46,410
--Pope John Paul's successor--

189
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:49,976
--and executed four generals--

190
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:52,980
Mommy, look at that.

191
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,815
Mommy, come over here.

192
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,489
Mommy. Who's that man?

193
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,097
Jason, come away.
He probably works here.

194
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,501
The Wells exhibit is on loan
from the British Museum.

195
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:13,805
The objects in this hall
form a portrait of the public...

196
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:17,274
...and private life
of an extraordinary person...

197
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,939
...whose prophetic vision influenced
the shape of things to come.

198
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,814
On your left is the inlaid wood
secretary with a unique top...

199
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:30,753
...from Wells' rooms.
It was on this desk....

200
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,325
Hey! Get away from the exhibit.

201
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,359
Where do you think you are,
Disneyland?

202
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:44,639
-Pardon?
-You heard me. Get behind those ropes.

203
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:49,435
--was discovered by workmen
digging where Wells ' house once stood.

204
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:50,736
Come on.

205
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:57,779
The reasons for his building it
are unknown.

206
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,091
--that it didn't work
made him avoid discussing it.

207
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:14,291
-H.G. Wells was born in....
-Novel? Time Machine?

208
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,575
You people. Christ, Almighty.

209
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,048
Never.

210
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:09,453
Eight hours off.

211
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:25,328
What did you do to my car?
Can't you drive?

212
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,865
Some SOB can't read.

213
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,877
-Could you tell me what city this is?
-Oh, come on.

214
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,262
Could you please tell me
what city this...?

215
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,966
San Francisco?

216
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:13,614
California. Of course!
Eight hours difference.

217
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:19,082
Thirteen, 14, 15 pounds. This money
is quite old, you're aware of that.

218
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:22,418
-They're still good, aren't they?
-Sure.

219
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:25,354
A coin dealer would give you more.

220
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,758
Here, all you'll get is the current
exchange rate, which is...

221
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:33,096
...$25.50.

222
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:38,834
-Twenty-five dollars?
-Really, it's the same all over.

223
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,170
Money makes the world go round.
It's just worth less and less.

224
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:47,439
Money, yes.
Everyone needs money.

225
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,677
Has there been another gentlemen
here recently...

226
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:56,050
...another Englishman
with currency like mine?

227
00:27:56,257 --> 00:28:01,092
Not that I recall.
And they would have sent him to me.

228
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:02,888
I see.

229
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:26,546
Get me a Big Mac, an order of fries
and a small Coke to go, please.

230
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:31,021
Thank you, dear.

231
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:39,627
Get me a Big Mac, fries
and tea to go, please.

232
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:52,903
Pommes frites.
Fries are pommes frites.

233
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:10,629
I never saw wood like this before.

234
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:54,436
I haven't seen stones in settings
like these since before the war.

235
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:57,770
-The war?
-Since the Second World War. You know.

236
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:03,450
-Did you say, "world war"?
-Since World War ll, I said.

237
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:13,861
-How much are they worth?
-Today's market? $6000 easy.

238
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,961
-Would you like to buy them?
-I couldn't give you top dollar.

239
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,398
That's all right. What's your offer?

240
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:37,215
-Four?
-Yes. Very well.

241
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:41,616
You don't want to think about it?
Okay. May I see some ID?

242
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:47,727
You know. Driver's license,
credit card, something like that.

243
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:53,960
-I'm afraid I don't have some.
-I can't do business without some ID.

244
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:56,602
-How do I know these aren't hot?
-Hot?

245
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:58,328
-Stolen.
-Stolen?

246
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:01,804
I assure you, I give you my word
as a gentleman.

247
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:06,504
Come on, what's this gentleman stuff?
How come you don't got any ID?

248
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:13,548
Let me do a computer check. If it's
clear, you'll have a check in a week.

249
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,245
I don't have a week.

250
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,955
I don't believe you exist.

251
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:02,494
But if you do, I need your help.

252
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,269
Just let me stay the night...

253
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:11,241
...and I'll be on my way in the
morning. I won't trouble you again.

254
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:20,646
I'm sorry. We're closing now.

255
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,517
Utopia.

256
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:06,064
200. 300. 400.

257
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:09,727
There you are, sir.

258
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:54,773
May I help you?

259
00:33:54,982 --> 00:33:57,917
I'd like to see the foreign
currency officer.

260
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,349
-You're looking at him.
-You?

261
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,124
Surely there must be a gentleman?

262
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:09,820
Don't be a chauvinist. It's taken
me three years to get here.

263
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:13,558
Don't you believe in women's
liberation?

264
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:16,999
Women's liberation.

265
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:20,439
I'm sorry. I meant no disrespect.

266
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,266
In fact, I was all for it,
so I shouldn't complain.

267
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:28,506
You were all for it?
What changed your mind?

268
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,681
Nothing.

269
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:35,151
I don't know whether you can help me.

270
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:41,357
-May I help you?
-Thank you.

271
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,558
I'm certainly willing for you to try.

272
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:49,327
I'm looking for an Englishman who may
have tried to exchange money.

273
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:51,061
I'll say.

274
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:52,534
Then he was here?

275
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:56,538
Yesterday, big as life.
With a money belt that was bigger.

276
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:59,235
Must've weighed a ton. A friend?

277
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:04,648
We were traveling together,
and now I've lost him.

278
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:08,720
-His name was John Leslie Stevenson.
-That's him.

279
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:13,690
I wanted him to open an account but
he only cashed a few hundred dollars.

280
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:17,023
You wouldn't happen to know
what's become of him?

281
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:20,662
He asked me to recommend a hotel.

282
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:25,100
-An hotel?
-I sent him to the Hyatt Regency.

283
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,203
-Hyatt Regency?
-Yeah.

284
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:32,336
Oh, thank you.

285
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,981
You here on a visit?

286
00:35:42,189 --> 00:35:44,350
Tourist type thing?

287
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,559
If you don't know anyone,
let me show you around.

288
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,894
We San Franciscans are pretty
proud of this old town.

289
00:35:57,638 --> 00:35:58,627
Well...

290
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,037
...yes, perhaps that might be nice.

291
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:10,516
It's your option. You've got the card.
Give me a ring. My name's Amy.

292
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:12,652
-A ring?
-You know:

293
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,423
My number's on the card.

294
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,664
-What's your name?
-Herbert...

295
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:28,892
...Wells.

296
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,039
What was that?

297
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:42,145
That was a very cute man.

298
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:44,279
That was a pickup.

299
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:46,985
-Against bank rules.
-I don't care.

300
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:52,319
At least he's not gay.
Plus, I love the way he talks.

301
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:55,723
How about that suit? Early American.

302
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:58,429
He'll be back.

303
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,187
-What's up, doc?
-Pardon?

304
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:30,557
Where to?

305
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:34,633
Could you take me, as quickly
as possible, to the Hyatt--?

306
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:33,419
-Who is it?
-Your breakfast, sir.

307
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:57,816
-Bless my soul.
-May I come in?

308
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,648
Certainly, certainly.

309
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:07,226
You were literally the last person
on earth I expected to see.

310
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:12,396
There was no way to prevent the
machine's return. I lack the key.

311
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,835
-No.
-You do manage to find the nerve...

312
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:19,267
...after I tested
your machine for you.

313
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:24,075
How did you manage to track me down?
That was brilliant.

314
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,509
We'll add detective to your list
of accomplishments.

315
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:30,650
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.

316
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:34,553
I'm not here to engage
in idle banter, Stevenson.

317
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:37,918
You've used me and my machine
to escape justice.

318
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,094
I must congratulate you on the device.

319
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:45,994
At dinner the other century,
I thought you'd lost your wits.

320
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,797
Fate intervened, and I ascertained
that you are a Columbus of a new age.

321
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,702
The dawn of time travel.

322
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:56,638
I salute you.

323
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:02,713
-Come with me.
-Of course. Where are we going?

324
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,081
To the museum.

325
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:11,116
I'm obliged to take you back to face
the consequences of your acts.

326
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,894
You can't be serious.

327
00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:18,622
You're so Victorian.
How do I get back? By force?

328
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,997
Be reasonable, John.
We don't belong here.

329
00:40:23,204 --> 00:40:26,696
-We violated--
-We don't belong here?

330
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:29,800
Let me show you something.

331
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:32,770
Sit down.

332
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:36,510
Come on, I won't bite. Sit.

333
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:43,585
Now, look....

334
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,555
Terrorists carried out their threat
and began shooting...

335
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:53,529
...the first five of 106 Israeli
schoolchildren held hostage--

336
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:06,074
You haven't gone forward, Herbert.
You've gone back.

337
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:20,424
We've just received word that
Mayor Margolin of Columbus was shot.

338
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:25,296
We don't belong here.
On the contrary...

339
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,292
...I belong here completely
and utterly.

340
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:32,364
I'm home.

341
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,369
It's you who do not belong here.

342
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:43,007
You, with your absurd notions of a
perfect and harmonious society. Drivel.

343
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:48,121
The world has caught up
and surpassed me.

344
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:53,826
Ninety years ago, I was a freak.
Today, I'm an amateur.

345
00:41:54,228 --> 00:42:00,497
You go back. The future isn't
what you thought. It's what I am.

346
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:05,530
Do you know that you can
purchase a rifle? It's legal.

347
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:08,139
-These people encourage--
-Stop it!

348
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:15,876
It's catching, isn't it?

349
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,639
Violence.

350
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:23,216
You finding me is rather fortuitous.
For me, that is.

351
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,684
Otherwise, I'd be obliged
to search for you.

352
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:30,556
Are you going to give it to me?

353
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:35,066
-I have no idea what you mean.
-Of course you do.

354
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:37,669
I'm talking about the key.

355
00:42:38,238 --> 00:42:42,902
I can't have you following me for
eternity, like the Flying Dutchman.

356
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:45,907
Give me the key and we'll be quits.

357
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,514
Key? I don't have it with me.

358
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:54,817
I've played countless games
of chess with you...

359
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:58,348
...and the one thing
you cannot do is bluff.

360
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:03,860
I want that key.

361
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:07,860
Oh, God.

362
00:43:11,071 --> 00:43:12,936
Maid.

363
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,269
Señor.

364
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:49,366
Stevenson.

365
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,425
Is he okay?

366
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:09,776
I beg your pardon.

367
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:12,213
Just a moment, please.

368
00:46:12,986 --> 00:46:14,317
Yes?

369
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,456
I'm looking for a patient
recently admitted.

370
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:21,458
-Name?
-John Leslie Stevenson.

371
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:25,857
-Not here.
-They told me he'd be here.

372
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:30,829
-This is San Francisco Hospital?
-Not here under that name. Next.

373
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:34,872
-He just arrived. A motorcar hit him.
-A motorcar?

374
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:36,709
-Pardon?
-A car.

375
00:46:37,177 --> 00:46:38,405
Yes, a car.

376
00:46:39,846 --> 00:46:44,283
He's a tall, flaxen-haired,
distinguished-looking Englishman.

377
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:46,475
Just a minute, please.

378
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:54,758
Sorry. An accident victim matching
your description died 20 minutes ago.

379
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:58,625
-We had him listed as John Doe.
-Died?

380
00:46:58,932 --> 00:47:02,265
Impossible. I saw him sitting
up after the accident.

381
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:05,302
His chart says, "internal injuries."

382
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,506
It happens that way sometimes.

383
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:12,671
Wait. May I see the body?

384
00:47:12,879 --> 00:47:17,441
Are you family? Are you a relative?

385
00:47:17,651 --> 00:47:20,415
-He doesn't have any relatives.
-I'm sorry.

386
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:23,681
-Wait a minute, please.
-Excuse me.

387
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,832
O-R-A-J.

388
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,445
Gloriosky.

389
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,555
-Oh.
-Hello.

390
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,990
You'll let me take you to lunch.

391
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:05,289
Hello. What did you say?

392
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:07,990
I said, lunch on me.
What do you say?

393
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:10,260
Oh, well....

394
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,296
Just let me get my things.

395
00:48:15,842 --> 00:48:18,003
That is what you had in mind?

396
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:21,777
-Certainly, if you like.
-Wait right there.

397
00:48:41,968 --> 00:48:44,664
All set. Where to?

398
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:48,702
Well, it's your city.
I'll leave it up to you.

399
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,307
I know, something with a view.

400
00:48:54,881 --> 00:49:00,877
Don't worry, it's safe. We haven't had
any trouble since the big one in 1906.

401
00:49:01,588 --> 00:49:02,612
Big one?

402
00:49:02,823 --> 00:49:06,816
The earthquake. Don't you know?
You haven't done your reading.

403
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,690
-It leveled the whole shebang.
-The shebang?

404
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:12,821
I see.

405
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:22,566
Delicious. Far superior to that
Scottish place where I breakfasted.

406
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:26,371
-Scottish?
-MacDougall's.

407
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:31,144
-What about your friend?
-Friend?

408
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:32,682
Dr. Stevenson.

409
00:49:33,987 --> 00:49:36,478
He wasn't exactly my friend.

410
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:41,320
We had a falling out.
I won't be seeing him again.

411
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:47,998
I like that suit. Is that what they're
wearing in London?

412
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:50,192
It was when I left.

413
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:55,364
Are you from London? Everyone
I meet from England is from London.

414
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,475
Sorry, what were you saying?

415
00:49:57,677 --> 00:50:01,909
I was asking if you're from London.
I have some friends there.

416
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:04,140
I thought you might know them.

417
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:09,288
I realize it's a big city.
Anyway, their name is Phillips.

418
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:12,322
He works for Coca-Cola. Any chance?

419
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:14,460
-No, I'm afraid not.
-Ah, yes.

420
00:50:14,661 --> 00:50:17,425
You probably move
in different circles.

421
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:25,036
Are you a scientist or something?

422
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:28,231
Whatever makes you say that?

423
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:29,936
Just a hunch.

424
00:50:30,143 --> 00:50:35,672
You give me the impression of
someone who's cloistered away...

425
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:41,149
...in a library, doing research
and never reads the newspaper.

426
00:50:41,354 --> 00:50:45,791
I used to write for a newspaper.
The Pall Mall Gazette.

427
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:50,520
Really? Shows how much I know.
You're a reporter?

428
00:50:50,997 --> 00:50:56,526
I wrote articles on whatever struck
my fancy. Social issues, mainly.

429
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:02,708
The last thing I did was a series
on free love.

430
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:05,304
Free love?

431
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,109
I haven't heard that term
since the eighth grade.

432
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:20,385
Tell me something.

433
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:25,725
Did you think it was forward of me
to invite you to lunch like this?

434
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:31,504
-Do you often--?
-Invite strange men to lunch? No.

435
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:35,664
But it's not often that a strange man
turns me on.

436
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:37,969
Or a strange woman.

437
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,614
I didn't mean to imply I was a dyke.

438
00:51:41,815 --> 00:51:44,716
-A dyke?
-Sorry, lesbian.

439
00:51:44,918 --> 00:51:46,613
I like my sex straight.

440
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,985
It's just that I go for months without
meeting anybody who does it for me.

441
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,252
A lot of people,
like my friend Carol....

442
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:59,091
I won't gossip,
but a lot of people can sleep around.

443
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:04,896
Not me. I really have to like the guy.
Otherwise, it's just no go.

444
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:11,166
I'm sorry.

445
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,074
I shouldn't say that
right off the bat.

446
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:18,081
It's not Women's Lib.
I just get nervous.

447
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:21,220
When I get nervous,
I tend to babble.

448
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,150
-Do I make you nervous?
-Yes.

449
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,954
-You do, sort of.
-Why?

450
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:33,693
Because I like you.

451
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:48,608
You ought to see the Golden Gate.

452
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,174
What's that?

453
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:53,614
You're kidding.
How'd you decide to come here?

454
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,789
Stick a pin in a map or something?

455
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:01,051
-The Golden Gate.
-The Golden Gate.

456
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:05,391
-Want to drive across it?
-Oh, is it for motorcars?

457
00:53:31,758 --> 00:53:35,751
R stands for "reverse,"
and D stands for "drive."

458
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:41,332
The right pedal causes us to accelerate
while the left retards our speed.

459
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:46,836
Of course. Honestly, Herbert, you act
like you've never been in a car before.

460
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,565
Nonsense, I was in one this morning.

461
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:52,540
You've a very good driver.

462
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:57,806
Damn straight. My husband used
to drive in stock car rallies.

463
00:53:58,018 --> 00:54:00,248
He taught me good.

464
00:54:02,778 --> 00:54:09,031
-What are you thinking about?
-A brave new world with such people.

465
00:54:08,784 --> 00:54:12,224
-May I ask you a question?
-Sure.

466
00:54:11,787 --> 00:54:14,494
You mentioned your husband.

467
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:20,701
My ex. Yeah, I was married
for a while, when I was very young.

468
00:54:20,796 --> 00:54:25,006
We met during an antiwar
demonstration.

469
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,983
-The Second World War.
-What? How old do you think I am?

470
00:54:29,805 --> 00:54:34,146
Oh, I'm sorry. The Third World War?

471
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:38,249
The Vietnam War.

472
00:54:37,813 --> 00:54:39,753
Vietnam.

473
00:54:39,815 --> 00:54:46,259
It's just that he wanted me to give up
work and have children.

474
00:54:45,821 --> 00:54:49,030
The housewife routine.

475
00:54:49,825 --> 00:54:52,166
Not for me.

476
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:56,106
He never took my ambitions seriously.

477
00:55:01,777 --> 00:55:05,077
What about you? You married?

478
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,654
I wouldn't be here if I were.

479
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:12,028
Well, that's nice.

480
00:55:12,788 --> 00:55:15,431
A lot of guys....

481
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:18,190
It's no big deal.
I like that.

482
00:55:18,794 --> 00:55:22,299
I'm also divorced,
for similar reasons.

483
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:27,876
-She wanted you to be a housewife?
-She wanted me to be routine.

484
00:55:28,804 --> 00:55:32,910
Well, that is one thing
you definitely are not.

485
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:37,109
First I thought it was your voice
or your clothes.

486
00:55:36,812 --> 00:55:38,582
Now, I don't know.

487
00:55:38,814 --> 00:55:42,952
Maybe it's that "little boy lost"
quality you give off.

488
00:55:42,818 --> 00:55:48,187
-Brings out my maternal instincts.
-You're very perceptive.

489
00:55:50,826 --> 00:55:53,965
Lost is what I am.

490
00:56:00,776 --> 00:56:02,673
No.

491
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:17,951
Herbert.

492
00:56:20,796 --> 00:56:24,294
It's only a movie.

493
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:34,733
I hate all that violence.

494
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,675
Did you ever see Red Shoes?

495
00:56:37,813 --> 00:56:41,977
I really got off on that.
Careers.

496
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:01,774
Do you have plans for tonight?

497
00:56:46,822 --> 00:56:48,749
I haven't made any.

498
00:56:48,824 --> 00:56:53,191
-Are you tired of me yet?
-No, not in the least.

499
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,624
Great.

500
00:56:54,830 --> 00:57:00,361
How about I cook you dinner?
I don't live very far from here.

501
00:56:59,775 --> 00:57:04,870
-It's not too much trouble?
-I'm half Italian. I love to cook.

502
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:09,602
-What about the other half?
-Norwegian. Norwegians love to eat.

503
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,314
What on earth is that?

504
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:22,389
Isn't it incredible? They built it
for the Pan-American Expo of 1914.

505
00:57:21,797 --> 00:57:26,392
Somehow, it's still standing.
I love living next to it.

506
00:57:25,801 --> 00:57:29,122
Come on, I'll give you the cook's tour.

507
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:32,860
I bet you don't have anything
like this in London.

508
00:57:32,808 --> 00:57:38,702
-You've never seen the Albert Hall.
-I've never even been to London.

509
00:57:38,814 --> 00:57:41,535
-Where do you live?
-This way.

510
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:47,714
You should see it
when they turn the lights on.

511
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:52,378
-Is it marble?
-Would you believe plaster?

512
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:05,762
What on earth is Cosmopolitan?

513
00:58:05,781 --> 00:58:08,568
Where are all your books?

514
00:58:08,784 --> 00:58:11,139
I don't have all that many.

515
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:14,709
I don't seem to read much anymore.

516
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,370
Even when I have the time,
it's easier to watch TV...

517
00:58:17,793 --> 00:58:21,345
...even though that's mainly crap.

518
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:23,351
What's that?

519
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:25,044
The phone.

520
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,255
Ted's idea.
Hello? Oh, hi.

521
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:34,294
It's my friend Carol, from the bank,
checking up on you.

522
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:35,794
Yeah.

523
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:40,202
No.

524
00:58:40,816 --> 00:58:42,932
Who knows?

525
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:51,041
Carol, I'm trying, so will you please
let me get on with it?

526
00:58:50,826 --> 00:58:54,449
I have to go now. Bye.

527
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,677
Carol says hi.

528
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:01,653
She asked if London
is really crawling with Arabs.

529
00:59:01,777 --> 00:59:04,588
-Arabs?
-She wants to marry into oil.

530
00:59:06,782 --> 00:59:10,425
This is almost ready.
I'm going to change.

531
00:59:09,785 --> 00:59:13,693
I've been in my work clothes all day.

532
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:17,067
Please, you go right ahead.

533
00:59:46,822 --> 00:59:50,537
You look very beautiful.

534
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,371
Herbert, if you don't take me
into your arms this minute...

535
01:00:26,802 --> 01:00:29,807
...I'll scream.

536
01:00:48,824 --> 01:00:52,662
Well, hello there.

537
01:00:52,828 --> 01:00:54,633
Hello.

538
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:03,908
Why, Miss Jones, you're gorgeous.

539
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:17,088
-What?
-You don't close your eyes.

540
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:19,922
Well, neither do you.

541
01:01:26,802 --> 01:01:31,996
These are the funniest buttons
I ever saw.

542
01:01:31,807 --> 01:01:35,302
It's like it was some kind of costume.

543
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:38,143
Oh, my gosh.

544
01:01:37,813 --> 01:01:42,214
Is the rest of this outfit
as interesting?

545
01:01:49,825 --> 01:01:53,222
Amy. Amy.

546
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:56,294
I don't want to compromise you.

547
01:01:55,831 --> 01:01:59,491
Are you certain I'm not
forcing you--?

548
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:04,901
Forcing me? My God, Herbert,
I'm practically raping you.

549
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,701
Yeah, that's true.

550
01:02:12,788 --> 01:02:14,113
Here.

551
01:02:18,794 --> 01:02:21,115
All naked, all right here.

552
01:02:20,796 --> 01:02:25,284
The hottest, wildest, sexiest ladies
in San Francisco.

553
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,521
Come on and check it out.
This is the one.

554
01:02:27,803 --> 01:02:32,963
This is where it's happening.
Come on in, buddy.

555
01:02:32,808 --> 01:02:36,161
If you're old enough,
you're bold enough.

556
01:02:35,811 --> 01:02:40,231
Come here, come here.
Let me show you.

557
01:02:39,815 --> 01:02:43,340
Third largest in the West.

558
01:02:57,833 --> 01:03:00,655
The weather should be sunny.

559
01:03:01,777 --> 01:03:05,595
It's a nippy 51 degrees,
going up to 68...

560
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:08,794
...then dropping to
an overnight low of43.

561
01:03:09,785 --> 01:03:11,898
Good morning.

562
01:03:11,787 --> 01:03:14,372
Good morning.

563
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:20,781
-You want some coffee?
-Thank you.

564
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:24,885
--walked into city hall
and shot Mayor Margolin.

565
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:30,354
In local news, the second body
in 14 hours was found in North Beach.

566
01:03:29,805 --> 01:03:32,959
Identified as prostitute Cindy Chow...

567
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:38,567
...the mutilated corpse was found in an
alley behind the City Lights Bookstore.

568
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:41,602
Police had no comment
on the two murders...

569
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:44,433
...stating only
that they were similar.

570
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:48,042
According to the police chief,
there are no leads.

571
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:49,803
In other news--

572
01:03:49,825 --> 01:03:51,036
No.

573
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:52,336
Coffee's ready.

574
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:56,279
How do you take it?
Is milk okay instead of cream?

575
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:57,952
I have to talk to you.

576
01:03:57,833 --> 01:04:02,717
-I'm running late.
-Amy, I have to talk to you now.

577
01:04:02,778 --> 01:04:06,483
He's alive and out there.
I have no idea what to do.

578
01:04:05,781 --> 01:04:09,597
You say you're after this man.

579
01:04:09,785 --> 01:04:13,030
Are you a detective?
You work for Scotland Yard?

580
01:04:12,788 --> 01:04:17,194
Let's just say their interests
are definitely involved.

581
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:21,138
I don't understand. Why can't
you just go to the police...

582
01:04:20,796 --> 01:04:24,335
...tell them who they're looking for?

583
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,608
-What's wrong with that?
-They'd never believe me.

584
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:32,789
-You don't know that
-They'd never--

585
01:04:32,808 --> 01:04:36,014
If you knew the story,
you'd never believe me.

586
01:04:35,811 --> 01:04:39,320
-I'd believe you.
-Well, they wouldn't.

587
01:04:38,814 --> 01:04:43,794
If I told the truth, they'd send
me to a lunatic asylum, not him.

588
01:04:43,819 --> 01:04:48,437
All right. I led you to him, didn't l?

589
01:04:47,823 --> 01:04:51,697
What were you doing,
visiting bank after bank?

590
01:04:51,827 --> 01:04:55,843
Would you have slept with anyone
who knew where he was?

591
01:04:56,832 --> 01:05:00,477
You don't suppose that for one minute.

592
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:06,588
No. I guess I don't.
I don't know, this is very confusing.

593
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:08,950
I'm late on top of everything else.

594
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:12,094
-Today is the executive staff meeting.
-Sorry.

595
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:15,752
I didn't want to burden you.
I'll get dressed and go.

596
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:18,934
No, no, no.
Oh, please, you stay.

597
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:21,001
I don't know what to say.

598
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:25,504
I like you. I like you very much.
I'd like to see you again.

599
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,804
I don't know how to help you,
if you can't go to the police.

600
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:35,383
-I don't know where you're staying.
-Yesterday was my first day.

601
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:40,352
Will you stay here for a while? Eat
something and try to sort things out.

602
01:05:39,815 --> 01:05:45,688
I'll call you if I get
any bright ideas, okay?

603
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:50,859
Be sure and slam the door
when you leave or it doesn't lock.

604
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:55,662
One thing I wouldn't have
pegged you as, a detective.

605
01:06:40,816 --> 01:06:46,046
Well, you look like the cat
that ate the canary. Did you?

606
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:50,749
-Hi, Carol, how's everything?
-"Hi, Carol, how's everything?"

607
01:06:50,826 --> 01:06:53,929
You're the one who took off
the whole afternoon.

608
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:58,156
In one word, fabulous. He's....

609
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:01,064
I just can't describe it.

610
01:07:00,776 --> 01:07:05,263
On second thought, please don't try.
I may just die of envy.

611
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:09,934
I want you to meet him. Could you come
for dinner Friday, around 7?

612
01:07:09,785 --> 01:07:13,205
I'm sure it will be fine with Herbert.

613
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,851
Herbert?

614
01:07:17,793 --> 01:07:21,580
You must really be hooked.

615
01:07:21,797 --> 01:07:26,888
I think so. I'll just check my busy
social calendar. Talk to you later.

616
01:07:30,806 --> 01:07:32,092
Hello again.

617
01:07:38,814 --> 01:07:42,005
I've come to change some
more currency.

618
01:07:46,822 --> 01:07:49,184
Yes, of course.

619
01:07:52,828 --> 01:07:56,515
How much did you want
to exchange this time?

620
01:07:55,831 --> 01:07:59,523
Oh, say 40 guineas.

621
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,129
Forty guineas.

622
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:13,599
I'm sorry, would you excuse me
for a moment? I'll be right back.

623
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:15,834
Take your time.

624
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:30,484
Herbert, Herbert.
Come on, come on.

625
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,864
Herbert, it's me.

626
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:39,064
-Listen, he's here.
-Amy?

627
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:44,072
-Who is?
-Who do you mean who? Who do you think?

628
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:45,298
What?

629
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:49,408
He's right at my desk
with a money belt.

630
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:52,547
He wants to change more sovereigns.

631
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:57,846
-Herbert, what do I do? I'm terrified.
-Amy, be calm. It's all right.

632
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:01,022
You're in a bank.
He's mad but he's not stupid.

633
01:09:00,776 --> 01:09:04,522
Now, nothing's going to happen to you.

634
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:07,026
-Can you keep him there?
-What?

635
01:09:06,782 --> 01:09:11,495
It's a lot to ask, but try.
Just until I'm there. I'm on my way.

636
01:09:11,787 --> 01:09:14,365
-I'll try.
-What did you say?

637
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:18,772
I said I'll try.

638
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,343
Sorry about that. I checked
what the exchange rates are today.

639
01:09:28,804 --> 01:09:33,385
They fluctuate every day.
I wouldn't want you to get gypped.

640
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:36,422
-Are you enjoying San Francisco?
-Very much.

641
01:09:35,811 --> 01:09:37,923
That's wonderful.

642
01:09:37,813 --> 01:09:43,130
-Find room at the Hyatt Regency?
-Yes, thanks to you I've--

643
01:09:51,827 --> 01:09:53,206
Thanks to you.

644
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:06,344
You wouldn't happen to know
a man called Wells, would you?

645
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:10,487
I thought so.

646
01:10:10,786 --> 01:10:14,424
Miss Amy Robbins.

647
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:18,598
He asked you to detain me
until he got here, right?

648
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:22,235
-I don't know what you mean.
-Oh.

649
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:31,446
I won't conduct my business here
anymore, if it's all the same to you.

650
01:10:32,808 --> 01:10:35,247
Good day.

651
01:10:39,815 --> 01:10:43,154
There's just one other item.

652
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:46,885
Be good enough to leave a message
for Wells from me.

653
01:10:46,822 --> 01:10:49,394
Tell him I want that key.

654
01:10:48,824 --> 01:10:53,295
Tell him to leave it for me at the
exhibit. Leave it...

655
01:10:52,828 --> 01:10:55,834
...or face the consequences.

656
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:59,496
Have you got that?

657
01:10:58,834 --> 01:11:01,676
Yes, I believe you have.

658
01:11:02,778 --> 01:11:08,042
Herbert! You gotta bring the police
into this. Now if you don't, I will.

659
01:11:07,783 --> 01:11:11,687
That man is crazy,
I could see it in his face.

660
01:11:11,787 --> 01:11:13,411
And he threatened you.

661
01:11:12,788 --> 01:11:16,820
Something about leaving
the key to the exhibit.

662
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:22,896
Let's tell the police. If you don't,
I will, but I don't know what to say.

663
01:11:22,798 --> 01:11:25,966
You can't fool around
with a person like that.

664
01:11:32,808 --> 01:11:37,304
"Robbins. 2340 Francisco."

665
01:11:36,812 --> 01:11:41,348
His name is John Leslie Stevenson.
English, he's a surgeon.

666
01:11:40,816 --> 01:11:46,487
Approximately 37 years of age,
flaxen-hair, clean-shaven...

667
01:11:45,821 --> 01:11:50,250
...and stands well above
6 feet in height.

668
01:11:51,827 --> 01:11:54,893
What makes you say that this,
Dr. Stevenson...

669
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:57,828
...is responsible for the death
of the girls?

670
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,195
I just know for a fact he is.

671
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:03,997
-I see. Do you have spiritual powers?
-Do I what?

672
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:06,767
Are you a medium or a mystic?

673
01:12:06,782 --> 01:12:10,508
I make no claim to supernatural
gifts of any sort.

674
01:12:09,785 --> 01:12:14,513
If I could reveal the source
of my information, I....

675
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:19,447
As a matter of fact,
I'm also a detective.

676
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:24,749
I was sent from London on the trail
of Stevenson, traveling incognito.

677
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,689
My name....

678
01:12:32,808 --> 01:12:36,435
-My name is Sherlock Holmes
-Sherlock Holmes, I see.

679
01:12:36,812 --> 01:12:38,535
Go on, go on.

680
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:43,604
I can't. I gave you a complete
description, I told you his name.

681
01:12:43,819 --> 01:12:46,144
I've told you everything I know.

682
01:12:45,821 --> 01:12:49,841
It was good of you to share
your insights, Mr. Holmes.

683
01:12:49,825 --> 01:12:52,783
How can we reach you if we need
to speak to you?

684
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:56,322
Is that necessary?
I'm staying with a friend.

685
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:58,084
Must we involve her?

686
01:12:57,833 --> 01:13:03,287
Not unless it's unavoidable we contact
you. We're known for our discretion.

687
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,522
Very well.

688
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:10,331
Her name is Miss Amy Robbins.
She lives at 2340 Francisco.

689
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:14,401
Thank you for your time, Mr. Holmes.

690
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,914
You don't believe me, do you?

691
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:24,483
I'd like to. My job would
be simpler if I could.

692
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,214
This printout says U.S. Customs
has no record...

693
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:33,326
...of John Leslie Stevenson coming
here. British Customs has no record...

694
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:38,192
...of a man by that name leaving.
There's no mention of a Mr. Holmes...

695
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:43,065
...coming into the country. Now he
could be using another name...

696
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:48,073
...but since we don't know where he
is, we can't question him.

697
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:51,179
-Can we?
-No.

698
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:55,316
Well, thank you for your time.
Good day.

699
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:00,979
Put this on file.

700
01:14:01,777 --> 01:14:04,216
The entire affair was a fiasco.

701
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:08,864
-He didn't believe a word of it.
-Well, you tried.

702
01:14:08,784 --> 01:14:11,362
Trying isn't enough, I'm afraid.

703
01:14:30,806 --> 01:14:33,652
-Are we in or out here?
-Out.

704
01:14:33,809 --> 01:14:37,985
-Would you care to join me for a walk?
-Sure.

705
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:43,629
You have to slam it. All right.

706
01:14:43,819 --> 01:14:48,326
Old buildings have their
little quirks.

707
01:14:48,824 --> 01:14:53,070
Why is it your responsibility?

708
01:14:56,832 --> 01:14:59,481
I'm going to tell you the truth.

709
01:14:58,834 --> 01:15:02,947
In the first place,
my name isn't Herbert Wells.

710
01:15:02,778 --> 01:15:04,880
It's Herbert George Wells.

711
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:08,985
H.G. Wells.

712
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:15,720
In the second place,
I'm 113 years old.

713
01:15:30,806 --> 01:15:34,207
I swear to God, I am telling
you the truth.

714
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:38,916
Please, please believe me.

715
01:15:41,817 --> 01:15:46,058
-Where are you going?
-Home.

716
01:15:46,822 --> 01:15:48,394
You don't believe me?

717
01:15:47,823 --> 01:15:52,125
Christ, Herbert, what do you think?

718
01:15:51,827 --> 01:15:57,204
Please go away, I don't want
to see you anymore.

719
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:59,806
Amy!
Please, Amy, listen to me!

720
01:15:59,775 --> 01:16:05,138
I have listened to you. And a bigger
crock of shit I never heard.

721
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:09,284
Look, I don't know if you're crazy,
but I don't care.

722
01:16:08,784 --> 01:16:12,852
Just go back to whatever hole
you crawled out of.

723
01:16:12,788 --> 01:16:15,682
Go back to your machine.

724
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:18,350
Amy....

725
01:16:17,793 --> 01:16:21,928
Wait! Amy!

726
01:16:21,797 --> 01:16:26,334
Amy, what if I can prove
what I told you is true?

727
01:16:25,801 --> 01:16:30,233
Won't you give me that chance?
I know I sound mad!

728
01:16:29,805 --> 01:16:36,572
I knew how you'd respond. Didn't I say
yesterday you wouldn't believe me?

729
01:16:37,813 --> 01:16:40,738
And I said I would.

730
01:16:42,818 --> 01:16:48,883
All right. There is an H.G. Wells
exhibit with time machine.

731
01:16:53,829 --> 01:16:59,696
There is some resemblance between
you and the man in those pictures.

732
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,528
The museum is closing.

733
01:17:00,776 --> 01:17:05,696
But that doesn't prove anything.

734
01:17:05,781 --> 01:17:09,609
-Now what?
-I want you to go to the powder room.

735
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:17,685
Hang on.

736
01:17:22,798 --> 01:17:27,453
-Hello.
-Hi! Holy shit! Flowers.

737
01:17:26,802 --> 01:17:31,996
Wow. Let me go put these
in water. Come on in.

738
01:17:31,807 --> 01:17:34,328
-You're early.
-I couldn't wait.

739
01:17:33,809 --> 01:17:40,373
You're cute. Last time I had flowers
was my graduation in high school.

740
01:17:39,815 --> 01:17:43,374
You bring flowers to all your women?

741
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:48,304
Why don't you sit down
and I'll be right in, okay?

742
01:17:51,827 --> 01:17:54,254
You want some grass?

743
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:56,585
Grass?

744
01:17:56,832 --> 01:18:00,318
Marijuana. Don't they call it grass
where you're from?

745
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:04,125
England, right? I could tell
from your accent.

746
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:07,768
You're observant.
Are you a typical American woman?

747
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:10,938
Am I a typical American woman?

748
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,932
Me?

749
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:16,272
Yeah, more or less. You know.

750
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:18,977
I like to hang out.

751
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,474
And what about you?

752
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:26,883
-Are you a typical Englishman?
-Not really.

753
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:29,685
Neat watch.

754
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,489
Are we going somewhere?

755
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:36,359
No.

756
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,826
Well, what time is it?

757
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,634
Later than you think.

758
01:19:13,789 --> 01:19:18,137
This is really dumb.

759
01:19:55,831 --> 01:19:58,648
What's this gizmo?

760
01:19:58,834 --> 01:20:04,985
Well, let's just say we wouldn't
want to go anywhere without it.

761
01:20:06,782 --> 01:20:11,361
Right. This time I'll drive.

762
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:19,567
Come on. Get in.

763
01:20:27,803 --> 01:20:33,950
You know what you're doing? What am I
saying? This is completely bananas.

764
01:20:33,809 --> 01:20:39,180
I don't propose to take you a great
distance. Suppose we go to Saturday.

765
01:20:38,814 --> 01:20:43,624
-How would that be?
-Just fine. My cleaning's due back.

766
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:46,697
That would make it November the 10th.

767
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:54,003
Don't expect too much. The entire
voyage will last a quarter of a second.

768
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:57,439
-You ready?
-Come on.

769
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:08,047
Good. Can we go now, please?

770
01:21:07,783 --> 01:21:14,056
-You still maintain this is poppycock?
-That wasn't the word I had in mind.

771
01:22:11,787 --> 01:22:15,214
Amy, you just wait. You wait.

772
01:22:42,818 --> 01:22:46,709
We've got to go back.

773
01:22:47,823 --> 01:22:50,010
We must go back.

774
01:23:01,777 --> 01:23:05,160
We could easily avoid
this whole thing.

775
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:07,497
-You mean give him the key.
-No.

776
01:23:06,782 --> 01:23:10,107
I mean come back with me.

777
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:14,939
-Back?
-Yes. Back to 1893.

778
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:26,622
I'm a 20th century woman. I have
a career and a mind of my own.

779
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:30,986
Be reasonable. How am I gonna
make it in 1893?

780
01:23:30,806 --> 01:23:33,824
It's your life we're talking about.

781
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:37,399
My work is my life.

782
01:23:37,813 --> 01:23:42,196
As much as yours or any other man's.

783
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:46,276
Please don't start sounding
like my husband.

784
01:23:46,822 --> 01:23:53,045
-Wait a minute? What about forward?
-Forward?

785
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:59,550
You mean into the future. Yes!
Of course--

786
01:23:59,775 --> 01:24:02,821
No.

787
01:24:02,778 --> 01:24:08,022
No. We're forgetting something.Him!
I can't just leave him here.

788
01:24:07,783 --> 01:24:11,397
So much for your place or mine.

789
01:24:11,787 --> 01:24:13,462
Stop a bit.

790
01:24:12,788 --> 01:24:16,608
You know we're making a big mistake.

791
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:20,436
We keep imagining time is our enemy.
It's not.

792
01:24:19,795 --> 01:24:24,877
We know what's supposed to happen.
When and where. He doesn't.

793
01:24:27,803 --> 01:24:31,147
This is one time I do know
how he thinks.

794
01:24:30,806 --> 01:24:34,757
I even know before he thinks.

795
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:40,489
Look here. We're too late to prevent
the murder of number three.

796
01:24:39,815 --> 01:24:43,224
But what about number four?
Let's see.

797
01:24:42,818 --> 01:24:48,930
Dolores Marks. She was killed
in McLaren Park. Is that far?

798
01:24:48,824 --> 01:24:51,608
Nothing's far in San Francisco.

799
01:24:51,827 --> 01:24:55,303
She was killed. Or rather she will
be killed...

800
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:01,774
in McLaren Park.

801
01:24:57,833 --> 01:25:01,276
All I have to do is surprise him.

802
01:25:00,776 --> 01:25:05,423
I'll just sit tight here for a few
hours and then be off.

803
01:25:05,781 --> 01:25:09,751
We. I'm coming too.

804
01:25:09,785 --> 01:25:12,829
No. I absolutely forbid it.

805
01:25:12,788 --> 01:25:17,992
Herbert, you can't drive.
You don't even know where the park is.

806
01:25:17,793 --> 01:25:22,833
I'm safe. I've got till Friday

807
01:26:20,796 --> 01:26:24,333
Too bad there aren't any
sport stores open.

808
01:26:23,799 --> 01:26:26,027
Whatever for?

809
01:26:25,801 --> 01:26:29,502
So we could buy a gun.

810
01:26:28,804 --> 01:26:35,146
-He's dangerous, haven't you heard?
-I wouldn't purchase a weapon now.

811
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:39,408
What is this Victorian chivalry?
We're playing for keeps.

812
01:26:38,814 --> 01:26:43,554
Exactly. And Stevenson was right
about one thing.

813
01:26:42,818 --> 01:26:47,191
Violence is contagious. Like measles.

814
01:26:47,823 --> 01:26:53,590
The problem is not that things aren't
more efficient. They're the same.

815
01:26:53,829 --> 01:26:57,529
World war this. World war that.

816
01:26:56,832 --> 01:27:02,367
We're obviously killing more
efficiently. But we're still killing.

817
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:10,013
Well, I'm not going to stoop
to that man's barbaric level.

818
01:27:10,786 --> 01:27:15,920
The first man to raise a fist
is the man who has run out of ideas.

819
01:27:15,791 --> 01:27:17,546
I love you.

820
01:27:45,821 --> 01:27:48,180
Oh, no.

821
01:27:55,831 --> 01:27:58,263
What's happening?

822
01:27:58,834 --> 01:28:03,226
Goddamn it! The tire is flat.

823
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:08,031
-Can you mend it? Can it be repaired?
-Yes. It's gonna take time.

824
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:10,037
All right, Amy. Calm down.

825
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:14,541
You work as fast as you can
and I'll go telephone the police.

826
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:17,307
Where would I be likely to find one?

827
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:22,612
I don't know. There are phone booths
all around. Do you have a dime?

828
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:26,985
Herbert, do you have ten cents
for the call? Hurry!

829
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:30,889
-Here. It's 911.
-911.

830
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:34,555
-Read the instructions.
-I'll be right back.

831
01:29:07,783 --> 01:29:11,496
Out of order? Damn!

832
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:18,600
911.

833
01:29:29,805 --> 01:29:34,387
Did you get that? McLaren Park.
Get there as soon as possible.

834
01:29:33,809 --> 01:29:39,428
Can I what? Wells. No, Holmes.

835
01:29:38,814 --> 01:29:44,535
Sherlock Holmes.
McLaren Park, as soon as possible.

836
01:29:52,828 --> 01:29:56,871
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I think so.

837
01:30:10,786 --> 01:30:14,930
Oh, no. No.

838
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:20,897
Keep moving.
Don't stop, do you hear me?

839
01:30:20,796 --> 01:30:25,801
-Oh, my God.
-Come on, Amy. Go! Come on!

840
01:30:43,819 --> 01:30:47,391
I don't wanna die.

841
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:56,170
I don't wanna die.

842
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:08,652
First the zodiac and now this.

843
01:31:08,784 --> 01:31:13,317
-Yeah, they're out for blood, I see.
-I see Mr. Holmes called.

844
01:31:12,788 --> 01:31:18,588
-What time would that be?

845
01:31:19,795 --> 01:31:22,258
Maybe he is psychic.

846
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:27,537
No.

847
01:31:26,802 --> 01:31:31,573
We won't be here.
It's simple, we just won't be here.

848
01:31:35,811 --> 01:31:41,610
Just for a little bit. I'll come back,

849
01:31:41,817 --> 01:31:43,810
Where are you going?

850
01:31:43,819 --> 01:31:49,119
It's something I've got to do.
And you do trust me, don't you?

851
01:31:48,824 --> 01:31:54,993
I tell you what. What's the best
hotel in the city, your favorite?

852
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:58,499
The Huntington. I used to work there.

853
01:31:57,833 --> 01:32:02,104
The Huntington. Write down
the telephone number.

854
01:32:01,777 --> 01:32:08,304
If I'm not back in an hour, register
at the hotel. You've got the car.

855
01:32:08,784 --> 01:32:13,677
-Promise you'll be back. Promise me.
-I promise. I promise.

856
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:18,450
Now you try and get some rest.

857
01:32:17,793 --> 01:32:21,956
There's brandy in the flask
if you need it.

858
01:32:21,797 --> 01:32:25,826
That's all right, I have some Valium.

859
01:32:25,801 --> 01:32:31,367
-Sedatives.
-All right. Try and get some rest.

860
01:33:21,797 --> 01:33:24,287
Hold it right there.

861
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,217
-What is the meaning of this?
-Shut up.

862
01:33:28,804 --> 01:33:31,395
Amy!

863
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:34,923
-Look here.
-Listen, constable--

864
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:41,137
-Amy! Amy, get out of the house!
-Come on!

865
01:33:53,829 --> 01:33:57,218
-Just get Lieutenant Mitchell--
-Look ahead.

866
01:33:56,832 --> 01:34:01,450
-You're gonna have another murder.
-State your name, please.

867
01:34:00,776 --> 01:34:05,027
I told you. Herbert George Wells.
What is this?

868
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:08,825
-Your valuables.
-Preposterous. Now please hurry.

869
01:34:08,784 --> 01:34:12,469
-There is a lady in grave danger.
-Your watch, please.

870
01:34:11,787 --> 01:34:17,539
My watch? This is ridiculous.
Please, where is Lieutenant Mitchell?

871
01:34:16,792 --> 01:34:20,041
-You don't need that.
-Yes, we do.

872
01:34:19,795 --> 01:34:24,840
Miss Amy Robbins is in very great--
Why do you need my glasses?

873
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,507
-I demand to see Lieutenant Mitchell!
-Relax.

874
01:34:29,805 --> 01:34:36,491
I'm sorry, we have no one by the name
Amy Robbins registered at the hotel.

875
01:34:36,812 --> 01:34:39,360
You've absolutely no right....

876
01:34:38,814 --> 01:34:42,533
-Let me see Lieutenant Mitchell.
-No.

877
01:34:41,817 --> 01:34:46,431
Now! Soon! Hurry! Please! Help!

878
01:34:47,823 --> 01:34:52,468
I've told you. I've told you 50 times.
My name is H.G. Wells.

879
01:34:51,827 --> 01:34:57,377
I came here in a time machine.
I'm pursuing Jack the Ripper...

880
01:34:56,832 --> 01:35:00,017
...who escaped into the future.

881
01:34:59,775 --> 01:35:04,246
If you don't do something,

882
01:35:03,779 --> 01:35:09,286
What about the gun? They weren't
making that model back in 1893.

883
01:35:08,784 --> 01:35:15,831
I purchased it to defend Miss Robbins
should the worst come to the worst.

884
01:35:15,791 --> 01:35:20,162
-Where did you purchase it?
-A pawn shop. I don't remember it.

885
01:35:19,795 --> 01:35:23,341
You're wasting your time.
Please listen to me.

886
01:35:22,798 --> 01:35:29,343
Forget about the shop and the time
machine. Forget that I'm H.G. Wells.

887
01:35:28,804 --> 01:35:33,745
Please just save the girl.

888
01:35:33,809 --> 01:35:39,947
You'll have to do better than that.
Last time you were Sherlock Holmes.

889
01:35:41,817 --> 01:35:47,057
-All right, let's take it from the top.
-My name is H.G. Wells.

890
01:35:46,822 --> 01:35:51,201
I came here in a time machine.
The one at the museum.

891
01:35:50,826 --> 01:35:55,736
-Just tell me what you want.
-I want the truth!

892
01:35:55,831 --> 01:35:58,466
We're gonna stay here until I get it.

893
01:36:08,784 --> 01:36:11,084
Take a look at this.

894
01:36:12,788 --> 01:36:16,485
That's right. That's it.
Take a look.

895
01:36:15,791 --> 01:36:21,028
Look, you cretinous idiot.
This is tomorrow's bloody paper.

896
01:36:20,796 --> 01:36:24,964
You see what will happen
if you don't listen to me!

897
01:36:25,801 --> 01:36:29,335
Mr. Wells, or whatever
your real name is...

898
01:36:28,804 --> 01:36:34,171
...you know that novelty shops will
run a phony newspaper edition.

899
01:36:33,809 --> 01:36:40,510
You may have been born yesterday, but
I wasn't. Where did you get the gun?

900
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,866
Herbert.

901
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:06,535
Herbert?

902
01:37:05,781 --> 01:37:09,179
You want to break for dinner? Hey!

903
01:37:09,785 --> 01:37:11,874
I'll strike a bargain.

904
01:37:26,802 --> 01:37:30,562
I'll confess to anything you like!

905
01:37:58,834 --> 01:38:01,625
I killed them all.

906
01:38:21,797 --> 01:38:23,921
Now, please....

907
01:38:23,799 --> 01:38:28,922
Please send a car to 2340 Francisco.

908
01:38:29,805 --> 01:38:33,858
Send a car and I'll sign
whatever you want.

909
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:16,904
You're free to go.

910
01:39:18,794 --> 01:39:21,168
I'm sorry.

911
01:39:22,798 --> 01:39:27,551
Please believe me. I'm truly sorry.

912
01:40:25,801 --> 01:40:27,675
Herbert.

913
01:40:31,807 --> 01:40:35,514
Herbert, I'm over here.

914
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:41,625
He murdered Carol, my friend. I forgot
I invited her over to meet you.

915
01:40:41,817 --> 01:40:45,194
-Amy?
-He's got the car.

916
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,887
Amy?

917
01:40:50,826 --> 01:40:54,899
-The newspaper was wrong.
-Amy.

918
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:57,198
Not so fast.

919
01:40:56,832 --> 01:41:00,476
We have a little unfinished business.

920
01:41:00,776 --> 01:41:05,374
-What more do you want?
-You know what I want. Give me the key.

921
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:08,108
And you get the white queen.

922
01:41:08,784 --> 01:41:11,385
All right.

923
01:41:13,789 --> 01:41:18,260
-Let her go and I'll throw it to you.
-No.

924
01:41:17,793 --> 01:41:23,628
My mother was atrocious, but she
didn't raise mentally deficient sons.

925
01:41:23,799 --> 01:41:27,601
You throw me the key
and I'll release the girl.

926
01:41:27,803 --> 01:41:31,340
-On your honor.
-You have my word as a gentleman.

927
01:41:53,829 --> 01:41:56,297
Now there's just one thing.

928
01:41:55,831 --> 01:42:01,197
I would've expected that you'd noticed
I am not a gentleman.

929
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:08,838
-Say goodbye.
-Goodbye, Herbert.

930
01:42:19,795 --> 01:42:21,852
You know where we're going.

931
01:43:50,826 --> 01:43:55,484
You haven't instructed him in the use
of one of these machines?

932
01:43:55,831 --> 01:43:58,849
Go faster. Please.

933
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:21,439
Go faster.

934
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:26,014
If I go any faster I'm gonna wrap
us around a phone pole.

935
01:44:51,827 --> 01:44:55,977
-Herbert!
-Stevenson!

936
01:45:05,781 --> 01:45:08,158
Stevenson!

937
01:45:10,786 --> 01:45:14,789
What is it, H.G. ? You're becoming
extremely tiresome.

938
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:20,131
-The girl.
-Which girl? You mean this one?

939
01:45:19,795 --> 01:45:25,803
Let her go. Please, I beg you.
You can afford to be magnanimous.

940
01:45:25,801 --> 01:45:29,946
Women throughout the centuries
are yours for the taking.

941
01:45:29,805 --> 01:45:32,173
Is it so important?

942
01:45:33,809 --> 01:45:38,222
I don't find her attractive. Do you?
You're not about to disagree?

943
01:45:38,814 --> 01:45:40,081
No.

944
01:45:39,815 --> 01:45:44,693
-No, what?
-No, I don't find her attractive.

945
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:51,962
-Shall I cut her throat then?
-No. Please.

946
01:45:52,828 --> 01:45:58,030
John. You and I, we were friends once.
I admired you.

947
01:45:57,833 --> 01:46:03,704
What are you babbling about, Wells?
You've become quite an old fool.

948
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:09,785
Yes. I am an old fool.
I know nothing.

949
01:46:10,786 --> 01:46:14,316
And she means that much to you?

950
01:46:17,793 --> 01:46:19,862
Yes.

951
01:46:19,795 --> 01:46:22,557
Please.

952
01:46:28,804 --> 01:46:31,639
I'm sorry.

953
01:46:31,807 --> 01:46:35,975
H.G. , it's checkmate
and you've lost again.

954
01:46:39,815 --> 01:46:41,646
Herbert!

955
01:47:12,788 --> 01:47:15,549
What did you do?

956
01:47:15,791 --> 01:47:19,444
I sent him to where he belongs.

957
01:47:18,794 --> 01:47:21,750
Infinity.

958
01:47:22,798 --> 01:47:27,492
That's the last anyone will hear
of Jack the Ripper.

959
01:47:37,813 --> 01:47:42,602
It's time for us to say goodbye
before the police arrive.

960
01:47:43,819 --> 01:47:45,806
You going back?

961
01:47:46,822 --> 01:47:51,619
-Why?
-I've got to dismantle that machine.

962
01:47:51,827 --> 01:47:55,952
Until we master ourselves we have
no proper use for time.

963
01:47:55,831 --> 01:47:59,459
I've got those books to write.
Whatever they are.

964
01:47:58,834 --> 01:48:01,723
Fiction, I hope.

965
01:48:01,777 --> 01:48:04,399
Every age is the same.

966
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:09,132
It's only love that makes
any of them bearable.

967
01:48:17,793 --> 01:48:24,449
And finally, I must go back because
that is where I belong.

968
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:29,822
And my life is almost as important
to me as yours.

969
01:48:29,805 --> 01:48:32,924
Not quite.

970
01:48:32,808 --> 01:48:35,155
Almost.

971
01:48:50,826 --> 01:48:57,609
Herbert! You wait for me!
You wait for me!

972
01:48:57,833 --> 01:49:00,119
Herbert!

973
01:48:59,775 --> 01:49:05,819
It isn't life without you.
Please, look at me.

974
01:49:15,791 --> 01:49:22,578
Don't expect miracles. I'm changing
my name to Susan B. Anthony.

975
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,007
Let's go.
