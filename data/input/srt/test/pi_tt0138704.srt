1
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:06,523
9:13. Personal note.

2
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:10,606
When I was a little kid,

3
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,149
my mother told me
not to stare into the sun.

4
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:17,314
So once, when I was six, I did.

5
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,273
The doctors didn't know
if my eyes would ever heal.

6
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,898
I was terrified,

7
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:27,523
alone in that darkness.

8
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,732
Slowly,

9
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:34,107
daylight crept in
through the bandages

10
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,398
and I could see.

11
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,023
But something else
had changed inside me.

12
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,481
That day
I had my first headache.

13
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:50,732
Jenna, come back here.

14
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:54,149
Max, Max, can I do it?

15
00:02:54,231 --> 00:03:01,273
- Jenna.
- What's 322 times 491?

16
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,815
158, 102. Right?

17
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,940
Right!

18
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:08,565
OK, 73 divided by 22?

19
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,024
3.318... 18... 18...

20
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:15,773
.. 18... 18... 18... 18...

21
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,565
12:45.
Restate my assumptions.

22
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:38,398
One: Mathematics
is the language of nature.

23
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,107
Two: Everything around us

24
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:46,481
can be represented and
understood through numbers.

25
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:54,065
Three: If you graph the numbers
of any system, patterns emerge.

26
00:03:56,024 --> 00:04:00,107
Therefore, there are patterns
everywhere in nature.

27
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:04,231
Evidence:

28
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,523
The cycling
of disease epidemics;

29
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:10,398
the wax and wane
of caribou populations;

30
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:13,148
sun spot cycles;

31
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:17,773
the rise and fall of the Nile.

32
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,356
So, what about
the stock market?

33
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,690
The universe of numbers that
represents the global economy.

34
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:30,857
Millions of hands at work,
billions of minds.

35
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:34,940
A vast network, screaming
with life. An organism.

36
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:37,315
A natural organism.

37
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,732
My hypothesis:

38
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:43,315
Within the stock market,
there is a pattern as well...

39
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,898
Right in front of me,

40
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:48,523
hiding behind the numbers.
Always has been.

41
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,815
12:50, press return.

42
00:05:09,273 --> 00:05:10,648
Hello.

43
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:12,231
Maximillian Cohen, please.

44
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:15,231
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's Marcy Dawson.

45
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,231
I'm a partner at the predictive
strategy firm...

46
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:20,148
- I told you...
- Sorry I haven't called.

47
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:23,565
I hoped we could have lunch
tomorrow. Say one o'clock?

48
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,899
- Max, good.
- Hey, Devi.

49
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:53,607
- I grabbed you some samosas.
- Great.

50
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:57,024
- Your hair!
- What are you doing?

51
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,064
- You can't go out like that.
- It's fine.

52
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,231
- Don't worry.
- It's fine.

53
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:07,190
- You need a mom.
- I gotta go.

54
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:13,106
Max. Here, your samosas.

55
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:14,892
Thanks.

56
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:20,183
16:23. Results.

57
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,058
Euclid predicts
NTC will break 100 tomorrow.

58
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,725
A good bet. Other anomalies:

59
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:29,433
lt predicts PRO NET settling
at sixty-five and a quarter,

60
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,225
a career high.

61
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,559
Am I bothering you?
I'm sorry, I'll put it out.

62
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,225
Name's Lenny Meyer.

63
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:40,142
And you are?

64
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,308
Max.

65
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:45,433
Is that Max? Max... ?

66
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:49,350
- Max Cohen.
- Cohen! Jewish.

67
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:56,058
It's OK. I'm a Jew too.
Do you practise?

68
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,767
No. I'm not interested
in religion.

69
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:03,559
- Did you ever hear of Kabbalah?
- No.

70
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:06,183
- Jewish mysticism.
- Look, I'm busy right here.

71
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:08,427
I understand.

72
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:13,594
But right now is a very exciting
moment in our history.

73
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:17,844
Right now is
a critical moment in time.

74
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:20,761
- Really?
- Yeah. It's very exciting.

75
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:25,260
Have you ever put on Tefillin?
You know Tefillin?

76
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:28,719
Yeah, I know, it looks strange.
It's an amazing tradition.

77
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:32,511
It has a tremendous power. It's
a mitzvah Jewish men should do.

78
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:35,719
Mitzvahs, good deeds.
They purify us.

79
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:38,886
Bring us closer to God.
Wanna try it?

80
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,927
- Shit.
- You all right, Max?

81
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:03,427
Please. Please, a small one.

82
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,761
17:55. Personal note.
Second attack in under 24 hours.

83
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:13,469
Administered 80 milligrams
Promozine HCI

84
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,968
and six milligrams
Sumattrapan orally,

85
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,968
as well as one milligram
Dihydroric-atamine-mezilayte

86
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:20,968
by subcutaneous injection.

87
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:15,302
- Hi.
- Mr Cohen?

88
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:18,094
Marcy Dawson here again,
from Lancet-Percy.

89
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:23,261
I checked my schedule and I'm
in Chinatown tomorrow at three.

90
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:26,719
I'd love to stop by to meet you.

91
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,552
It'll be worth it for us.
How's three sound?

92
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:33,678
- How did you get my address?
- I got it from Columbia.

93
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:35,719
Three it is.
Looking forward to it.

94
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,511
Wait a minute...

95
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:12,010
Max.

96
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,219
Stop thinking, Max.

97
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:39,344
Just feel. Use your intuition.

98
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:51,135
- What did you think of Hamlet?
- I didn't get to it.

99
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:56,594
It's been a month. You haven't
taken a single break.

100
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,427
I'm so close.

101
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,553
Have you met the new fish
my niece bought me?

102
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:13,469
I named her lcarus after you,
my renegade pupil.

103
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:16,802
You fly too high,
you'll get burnt.

104
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,511
I look at you,
I see myself 30 years ago.

105
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:26,844
My greatest pupil.
Published at 16, PhD at 20.

106
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:30,427
But life
isn't just mathematics, Max.

107
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:34,427
I spent 40 years searching
for patterns in Pi.

108
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:38,594
- I found nothing.
- You found things.

109
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,302
I found things...

110
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,094
but not a pattern.

111
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,428
Not a pattern.

112
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:55,885
11:22. Personal note.

113
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,469
Sol died a little when
he stopped research on Pi.

114
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:04,261
It wasn't just the stroke.

115
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:07,428
He stopped caring.

116
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:11,386
How could he stop,

117
00:13:11,511 --> 00:13:15,969
when he was so close to seeing
Pi for what it really is?

118
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:24,885
How could you stop believing
that there is a pattern,

119
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,469
an ordered shape behind those
numbers, when you were so close?

120
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:35,719
We see the simplicity
of the circle,

121
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:38,635
we see the maddening complexity
of the endless numbers,

122
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,469
3.14 off into infinity.

123
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:45,261
# Are the stars out tonight?

124
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:49,010
# I don't mind
if they're cloudy or bright

125
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,553
# For I only have eyes

126
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:57,635
# For you, dear

127
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:02,593
# I don't mind
if we're in a... #

128
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:32,511
Hey, Max.

129
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:34,177
Lenny Meyer.

130
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:36,261
I'll put it out.

131
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:42,219
So... What do you do?

132
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:48,969
I work with computers. Math.

133
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:51,094
Math? What kind of math?

134
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,635
Number theory. Research mostly.

135
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,219
No way.
I work with numbers myself.

136
00:14:56,344 --> 00:15:00,552
I mean, not traditional.
I work with the Torah. Amazing!

137
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,760
Hebrew is all math.
It's all numbers.

138
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:09,593
You know that? Look.

139
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,844
Ancient Jews used Hebrew
as their numerical system.

140
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:15,261
Each letter's a number.

141
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:20,219
The Hebrew A, Aleph, is 1. 
B, Bet, is 2.

142
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:24,219
Understand? But look,
the numbers are interrelated.

143
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,802
Take the Hebrew for father, ab.

144
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,969
Aleph, Bet.

145
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:32,593
1, 2 equals 3.

146
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,885
The word for mother, haim.

147
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:37,844
Aleph, Mem.

148
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:44,177
1, 40 equals 41. 
The sum of 3 and 41, 44.

149
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:49,219
Right? Now, the Hebrew word for
child - mother, father, child.

150
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,552
Yelev.

151
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:54,719
That's 10, 30 and 4.

152
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:57,594
44.

153
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:02,969
Torah is just
a long string of numbers.

154
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:07,510
Some say that it's a code,
sent to us from God.

155
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:09,052
That's kind of interesting.

156
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,677
That's kid's stuff,
check this out.

157
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:14,344
The Garden of Eden, Kadem.

158
00:16:14,468 --> 00:16:17,719
Numerical translation, 144.

159
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:22,094
The value of tree of knowledge,
in the garden. Right?

160
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:26,719
Aat ha haim. 2, 33.1, 44.2, 33.

161
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:29,719
- You can take those numbers...
- Those are Fibonacci numbers.

162
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:30,760
They're... ?

163
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:33,802
You know,
like the Fibonacci sequence?

164
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,303
Fibonacci?

165
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:42,427
Fibonacci is an ltalian
mathematician in the 13th.

166
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:46,261
If you divide 144 into 233,

167
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:50,303
- the result approaches Theta.
- Theta?

168
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:56,719
Theta. The Greek symbol for the
golden ratio, the golden spiral.

169
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:00,094
Wow.

170
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,594
I never saw that before.

171
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:06,677
That's like that series
you find in nature?

172
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:11,510
- Like the face of a sunflower?
- Wherever there are spirals.

173
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:14,178
See, there's math everywhere.

174
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,379
Hey, I... Max?

175
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:42,420
13:26. Restate my assumptions.

176
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:53,921
can be represented
and understood through numbers.

177
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,838
patterns emerge.

178
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:05,629
Therefore, there are patterns
everywhere in nature.

179
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,963
So what about the stock market?

180
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,130
A universe of numbers that
represents the global economy.

181
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:13,921
Millions of human hands
at work, billions of minds.

182
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:17,213
A vast network screaming
with life. An organism.

183
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:19,754
A natural organism.

184
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:26,796
there is a pattern,
right in front of me,

185
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:29,295
playing with the numbers.
Always has been.

186
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,462
10:18, press return.

187
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,255
Max.

188
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,546
Max.

189
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,421
What the... ?

190
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:16,587
Shit!

191
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:20,171
Aaargh! God damn it!

192
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:26,171
10:28. Results.

193
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:31,796
Bullshit. Euclid predicts AAR
at six and a half.

194
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,587
AAR hasn't been
beneath 40 in 20 years.

195
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:39,963
Explanations for anomaly:
Human error.

196
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:24,046
11:11. Results.

197
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,337
Failed treatments to date:

198
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:33,629
Beta blockers, calcium channel
blockers, adrenaline injections,

199
00:21:33,754 --> 00:21:36,963
high-dose ibuprofen, steroids,

200
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:41,462
trigger metastics,
violent exercise, caffeine,

201
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:43,963
acupuncture, marijuana,

202
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:48,588
percodan, midrin, tenormen,
sanser, homeopathics...

203
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:53,046
No results.

204
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:57,337
No results.

205
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:15,963
Euclid crashed.

206
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:19,921
- I lost all my data, hardware.
- Your mainframe?

207
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,046
Burnt.

208
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,813
What... What's happened?

209
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,188
First, I get
these crazy low picks,

210
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:29,438
then it spit out
this string of numbers.

211
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:32,980
I never saw anything like it.
And then it fries.

212
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,772
- It crashed.
- You have a print out?

213
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,396
- Of what?
- Of the picks, the number?

214
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:41,897
- I threw it out.
- What number did it spit out?

215
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:44,271
I don't know,
a string of digits.

216
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,980
- How many?
- I don't know.

217
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:52,521
What is it, 100, 1,000, 216?
How many?

218
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:54,772
Probably around 200. Why?

219
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,396
I dealt with some bugs
back in my Pi days.

220
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:02,438
I wondered
if it was like one I ran into.

221
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:04,772
Have you met Archimedes?

222
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:09,104
The one with black spots. See?

223
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:13,438
You remember
Archimedes of Syracuse? Eh?

224
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,646
The king asks Archimedes
to determine if a present

225
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:22,980
he has received
is actually solid gold.

226
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:25,146
Unsolved problem at the time.

227
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,688
It tortures the great Greek
mathematician for weeks.

228
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:32,813
Insomnia haunts him and he
twists and turns in his bed

229
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:38,313
for nights on end. Finally,
his equally exhausted wife,

230
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:41,313
forced to share a bed
with this genius,

231
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:46,521
convinces him
to take a bath, to relax.

232
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:52,772
While he's entering the tub,
he notices the bath water rise.

233
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:58,355
Displacement -
a way to determine volume,

234
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,813
and thus a way
to determine density.

235
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:08,188
Weight over volume. And thus
Archimedes solves the problem.

236
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,480
He screams "Eureka!"
and he is so overwhelmed,

237
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:15,021
he runs naked through the
streets to the king's palace

238
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:17,480
to report his discovery.

239
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:23,271
Now, what is the moral
of the story?

240
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,313
That a breakthrough will come.

241
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:32,146
Wrong! The point of the story
is the wife.

242
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,772
Listen to your wife,
she'll give you perspective.

243
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:36,897
Meaning, you need a break.

244
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:40,229
You must take a bath
or you'll get nowhere.

245
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:43,813
There will be no order,
only chaos.

246
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:50,396
Go home, Max,
and you take a bath.

247
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:29,271
Excuse me.
Can I take a look at the paper?

248
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:40,772
Oh, my God.

249
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:50,480
Six and a half.

250
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:51,896
Hey...

251
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:54,730
Hey!

252
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,146
The paper, please.

253
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:48,688
Mr Cohen? Perfect timing.
I was going to head home.

254
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:52,021
- Who are you?
- Marcy Dawson. We were meeting.

255
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:53,063
It's really not...

256
00:26:53,188 --> 00:26:56,146
It's such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

257
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:57,938
- I studied your paper...
- Excuse me.

258
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:00,230
- Let's take my car.
- I can't.

259
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:01,230
Mr Cohen...

260
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,330
Yes!

261
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:56,247
I just threw out something.
I didn't realise I needed it.

262
00:27:56,372 --> 00:28:00,205
Just a print-out.
I lost my data.

263
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,330
Whoa! I'm sorry. Max.
How're you doing? Lenny Meyer.

264
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:16,788
- Where you going?
- Up there.

265
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:19,871
You got five minutes?
Do you wanna try Tefillin?

266
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:23,539
- Not now.
- I've a car to go to the Shul.

267
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:26,372
- You got a car?
- That's my friend, Ephraim.

268
00:28:29,205 --> 00:28:30,414
- Let's go.
- Great.

269
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:34,122
When you said you're Max Cohen,

270
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:36,871
I didn't realise
you were the Max Cohen.

271
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:41,330
Your work's revolutionary.
It's inspired the work we do.

272
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:44,414
- It has?
- Very much so.

273
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:49,080
The only difference is, we're
not looking at the stock market.

274
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:51,163
Go ahead.
Wrap that round your hand.

275
00:28:51,288 --> 00:28:53,955
We're searching for a pattern
in the Torah.

276
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,414
- What kind?
- We're not sure.

277
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,080
All we know is
it's 216 digits long.

278
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:03,288
- OK, stand up, please, Max.
- 216?

279
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:07,288
That's right. You've gotta
be quiet now. Stand up.

280
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,414
- 216?
- Shh. This goes on your head.

281
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:15,247
Look at me, Max. Right here.

282
00:29:15,414 --> 00:29:18,205
There you go.

283
00:29:20,455 --> 00:29:23,997
All right. Now, we'll say
a prayer together.

284
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:28,455
Repeat after me: Shma Yisroel.

285
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,455
- Shma Yisroel.
- Right.

286
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,414
- Adenoi Eloihenu.
- Adenoi Eloihenu.

287
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:39,330
- Adenoi Echod.
- Adenoi Echod.

288
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:45,080
Now, what's up, Max?

289
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:49,289
What is this 216 number, Sol?

290
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:50,289
Excuse me?

291
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,539
You asked me if I'd seen
a 216-digit number.

292
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:58,871
Oh, yeah. You mean the bug.

293
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:01,913
I ran into it working on Pi.

294
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,705
- What do you mean ran into it?
- Max, what's this about?

295
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,663
There are these religious Jews
I've been talking to.

296
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:11,621
Religious Jews?

297
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:13,788
Yeah, Hasids,
the guys with beards.

298
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:14,830
I know them.

299
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:18,871
I know one in a coffee shop.
He's a number theorist.

300
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:21,205
The Torah is his data set.

301
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,830
He says they're after
a 216-digit number in the Torah.

302
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:28,455
Come on, it's just coincidence.

303
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,038
There's something else, though.

304
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,746
What?

305
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,955
You remember those weird
stock picks?

306
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,163
- Yesterday's stock picks? Yes.
- They were correct.

307
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:42,289
I got two picks on the nose.
Smack on the nose, Sol.

308
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:45,205
Something's going on.

309
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,913
It has to do with that number.
There's an answer in it.

310
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:54,955
Max... Come with me.

311
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,746
The ancient Japanese
considered the Go board

312
00:30:57,872 --> 00:31:00,621
to be a microcosm
of the universe.

313
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:05,872
Although, when it's empty,
it appears simple and ordered,

314
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:10,122
the possibilities of gameplay
are endless.

315
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:14,955
No two Go games are alike,
just like snowflakes.

316
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,955
So, the Go board
actually represents

317
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:24,872
an extremely complex
and chaotic universe.

318
00:31:24,997 --> 00:31:28,746
And that's the truth
of our world, Max.

319
00:31:28,872 --> 00:31:31,913
It can't be
easily summed up with math.

320
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:35,122
There is no simple pattern.

321
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:38,580
But as the game progresses, the
possibilities become smaller.

322
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:41,830
The board takes on order.
Soon, every move's predictable.

323
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:42,913
So?

324
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,788
So maybe, even though
we're not aware of it,

325
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:52,788
there is a pattern, an order
underlying every Go game.

326
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:56,164
Maybe it's like the pattern
in the stock market?

327
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,164
The Torah? This 216 number?

328
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:01,955
- It's insanity.
- Maybe it's genius.

329
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:05,913
- I must get that number.
- Hold on! You're losing it.

330
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:09,289
You have to breathe.
Listen to yourself.

331
00:32:09,414 --> 00:32:13,788
You're connecting my computer
bug with one you might've had

332
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:16,122
and some religious hogwash.

333
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:21,456
If you want the number 216,
you can find it everywhere.

334
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,746
216 steps from your street
corner to your front door,

335
00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:29,788
216 seconds
you spend in the elevator

336
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:32,205
When your mind becomes obsessed

337
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,538
you filter everything else out
and find that thing everywhere.

338
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:40,205
320, 450, 22, whatever.

339
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:45,663
You've chosen 216 and you'll
find it everywhere in nature.

340
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,247
But, Max,

341
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:52,330
as soon as you discard
scientific rigour,

342
00:32:52,455 --> 00:32:55,455
you are no longer
a mathematician,

343
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,746
you're a numerologist.

344
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:02,164
Mr Cohen?

345
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,247
Mr Cohen...

346
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:06,289
God damn it! I'm sick
of you following me.

347
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:10,205
I'm not interested in money.
I want to understand our world.

348
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,455
I don't deal with materialists
like you.

349
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,830
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

350
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,930
I admit
we've been too aggressive.

351
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:22,014
But all I ask is that
you give me five minutes.

352
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:26,097
- As a token, accept this.
- I don't want your money.

353
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:31,139
The suitcase isn't filled
with 50s, or gold, or diamonds.

354
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:33,764
Just silicon. A Ming Mecca chip.

355
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:37,388
Ming Mecca? They're not even
de-classified yet.

356
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:41,889
You're right, they're not. But
Lancet-Percy has many friends.

357
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:44,430
Beautiful, isn't it?

358
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,972
Do you know how rare these are?

359
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:49,722
What do you... ?

360
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,972
Mr Cohen?

361
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:56,513
- Are you OK?
- No.

362
00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:00,097
Mr Coh... Sir, are you sick?

363
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,597
Hey!

364
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:37,222
C'mon, buddy. Get up.

365
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:40,305
It's Coney lsland, last stop.

366
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,764
Here. For your nose.

367
00:41:20,806 --> 00:41:24,264
Jenna, come back! Jenna!

368
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:28,472
Jenna, come back here.

369
00:41:43,138 --> 00:41:46,639
- Farrouhk?
- No, it's Max, from next door.

370
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:51,656
Max. Is everything all right?

371
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:54,905
- Do you have any iodine?
- Did you cut yourself?

372
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,239
No, it's to stain a slide.

373
00:41:57,364 --> 00:42:00,406
Ah. Science.
The pursuit of knowledge.

374
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:05,905
One second.

375
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:10,072
You surprised me.
I thought you were Farrouhk.

376
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:13,823
Here we are.

377
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:18,364
What are you examining?
A potato?

378
00:42:19,698 --> 00:42:22,448
No. Just something
for my computer. Thanks.

379
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:23,197
- Shalom.
- Lenny, it's Max Cohen.

380
00:43:23,323 --> 00:43:25,740
Max. What're you doing now?

381
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:28,905
I was thinking about
our conversation last night.

382
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:31,864
- That's good.
- I wanna help.

383
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,822
4:42. New evidence.

384
00:43:42,197 --> 00:43:44,656
Remember Pythagoras.

385
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:50,323
Mathematician, cult leader.
Athens, circa 500 BC.

386
00:43:50,406 --> 00:43:55,239
Major belief: The universe
is made of numbers.

387
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:58,031
Major contribution:

388
00:43:58,114 --> 00:44:01,156
The golden ratio.

389
00:44:02,905 --> 00:44:06,989
Best represented geometrically
as the golden rectangle.

390
00:44:07,114 --> 00:44:09,615
Visually, there exists
a graceful equilibrium

391
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,364
between its length and width.

392
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:17,364
When it's squared, it leaves a
smaller golden rectangle behind,

393
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,947
with the same unique ratio.

394
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:24,531
The squaring can continue,
smaller and smaller,

395
00:44:24,656 --> 00:44:25,864
to infinity.

396
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:01,947
11:18. More evidence.

397
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:06,406
Remember da Vinci. Artist,
inventor, sculptor, naturalist.

398
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:09,114
ltaly, C15th.

399
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,947
Rediscovered the perfection
of the golden rectangle

400
00:45:12,114 --> 00:45:16,114
and pencilled it
into his masterpieces.

401
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:20,239
Connecting a curve through the
concentric golden rectangles,

402
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:24,281
You generate the mythical
golden spiral.

403
00:45:24,406 --> 00:45:27,615
Pythagoras loved this shape,
for he found it in nature -

404
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:31,323
a nautilus shell, rams' horns,
whirlpools, tornadoes,

405
00:45:31,448 --> 00:45:35,739
our fingerprints, our DNA
and even our Milky Way.

406
00:45:36,573 --> 00:45:38,615
9:22. Personal note.

407
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,114
When I was a little kid,

408
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,489
my mother told me
not to stare into the sun.

409
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:46,739
So once, I did.

410
00:45:46,864 --> 00:45:49,114
At first, the brightness
was overwhelming,

411
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:52,114
but I kept looking,
forcing myself not to blink.

412
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:54,864
And then the brightness
began to dissolve.

413
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:59,864
My pupils shrank to pinholes
and everything came into focus.

414
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:02,780
And for a moment I understood.

415
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:06,947
My new hypothesis:
if we're built from spirals,

416
00:46:07,072 --> 00:46:09,364
while living in a giant spiral,

417
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:13,989
then everything we do
is infused with the spiral.

418
00:46:20,448 --> 00:46:22,697
10:15.

419
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:26,406
Personal note.

420
00:46:26,531 --> 00:46:30,864
lt's fair to say
I'm stepping out on a limb.

421
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,864
But I'm on the edge
where it happens.

422
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:36,198
I'm happy you...

423
00:46:36,448 --> 00:46:39,780
Look, what do you want
in exchange for the chip?

424
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:42,989
You tech' guys.
I think you know what we want.

425
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:47,573
- I may not find anything.
- We'll take the risk.

426
00:46:47,697 --> 00:46:50,406
First, I want you
to call off the surveillance.

427
00:46:50,531 --> 00:46:52,031
Done. Anything else?

428
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:57,364
Yeah, I'm a very private person.
Just knock on my door

429
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:00,822
and leave the suitcase outside.
I don't wanna talk to anybody.

430
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:04,781
- How do I know you're home?
- I'll knock back.

431
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:23,697
- The Torah.
- Coffee.

432
00:47:25,198 --> 00:47:27,198
What is it?

433
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:30,156
In Hebrew,
characters and numbers.

434
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:34,364
No, the 216 number. What is it?

435
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,739
I don't know.

436
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:40,947
If you can find it,
maybe we can figure it out.

437
00:47:41,073 --> 00:47:47,031
- Can you really find it?
- If it's there, I'll find it.

438
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:17,781
Max.

439
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:19,906
Jenna.

440
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:22,530
- Can we do it?
- Not now.

441
00:48:22,655 --> 00:48:23,947
Please, Max?

442
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:36,406
Happy birthday, Euclid.

443
00:50:04,323 --> 00:50:08,073
18:30. Press return.

444
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:35,656
18:33. Press return.

445
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:33,405
Hell!

446
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:36,531
You fuck! You fuck!

447
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,697
Fuck!

448
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:07,406
Fuck!

449
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,280
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

450
00:53:24,406 --> 00:53:26,906
Fuck you!

451
00:55:28,364 --> 00:55:31,406
Yes, hello?

452
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:34,614
He's busy right now, I'm sorry.

453
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:41,531
You were screaming.

454
00:55:41,614 --> 00:55:46,155
Who said you could
put locks on the door, Mr Cohen?

455
00:55:49,322 --> 00:55:51,739
Are you OK?

456
00:55:56,072 --> 00:55:59,197
You're out, you hear me?
Out of here!

457
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:02,031
- I've had it with you!
- Get out!

458
00:56:02,155 --> 00:56:04,906
Let's go.

459
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:08,447
God damn it, no! You're the one
out of here, mister.

460
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,573
Get out!

461
00:56:09,698 --> 00:56:12,072
Get out! Get out!

462
00:56:12,197 --> 00:56:14,072
Get out!

463
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,197
Are you OK?

464
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:19,948
Get out!

465
00:58:53,956 --> 00:58:55,956
You bastard.

466
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,457
Nineteen and a half.

467
00:59:41,749 --> 00:59:43,248
Thirty-nine and an eighth.

468
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,790
Six and three quarters.

469
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:50,623
Seven and an eighth.

470
00:59:52,457 --> 00:59:53,956
Twelve and a quarter.

471
00:59:57,665 --> 01:00:00,707
I know these numbers.

472
01:00:07,873 --> 01:00:12,665
They're going down...
down... down.

473
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,498
You lied to me.

474
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,040
You have it?

475
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:26,248
OK, sit down.

476
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:33,290
I gave up before I pinpointed
it, but my guess is that...

477
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:38,415
certain problems cause computers
to get stuck in a loop.

478
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:43,915
The loop leads to meltdown,
but just before they crash

479
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:49,582
they become aware
of their own structure.

480
01:00:49,707 --> 01:00:54,624
The computer has a sense
of its own silicon nature

481
01:00:54,749 --> 01:00:58,165
and it prints out
its ingredients.

482
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:02,206
The computer becomes conscious?

483
01:01:02,332 --> 01:01:07,415
In... In... some ways...
I guess.

484
01:01:10,123 --> 01:01:14,165
Studying the pattern
made Euclid conscious of itself.

485
01:01:14,332 --> 01:01:18,831
It died spitting out the number.
Consciousness is the number?

486
01:01:18,956 --> 01:01:22,040
No, Max. It's only a nasty bug.

487
01:01:22,165 --> 01:01:25,624
- It's more than that.
- No. It's a dead end!

488
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:29,748
- There's nothing there!
- It's a door, Sol. A door.

489
01:01:29,873 --> 01:01:33,123
A door to a cliff, you're
driving yourself over the edge.

490
01:01:33,248 --> 01:01:36,332
- You need to stop.
- You were afraid.

491
01:01:36,457 --> 01:01:39,040
- That's why you quit.
- I got burnt.

492
01:01:39,165 --> 01:01:41,332
- Come on.
- It caused my stroke!

493
01:01:41,457 --> 01:01:45,998
That's bullshit! It's
mathematics, numbers, ideas.

494
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:48,915
Mathematicians
should go to the edge.

495
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,748
- You taught me that.
- It's death!

496
01:01:51,915 --> 01:01:53,665
You can't tell me what it is.

497
01:01:53,831 --> 01:01:56,831
You've retreated to your Go
and books and goldfish.

498
01:01:56,915 --> 01:01:57,956
Max, go home.

499
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,998
- You're not satisfied.
- Go home. Get out...

500
01:02:00,123 --> 01:02:01,332
I'm gonna see it!

501
01:02:01,457 --> 01:02:04,207
- Get out!
- I'm gonna understand it.

502
01:02:21,207 --> 01:02:22,248
Hey!

503
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:28,706
Hey!

504
01:02:35,165 --> 01:02:36,123
Hey!

505
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,915
- Who are you working for?
- Me.

506
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,290
- Who sent you?
- I'm a student.

507
01:03:48,415 --> 01:03:51,373
- Gimme that.
- I've an assignment for class.

508
01:03:53,082 --> 01:03:54,207
Leave me alone.

509
01:04:08,082 --> 01:04:14,290
- Marcy. What's the matter?
- Let's go for a ride, Max.

510
01:04:14,415 --> 01:04:16,207
I can't. I have work.

511
01:04:18,207 --> 01:04:21,706
We had a deal, Max.
Now, let's get in the car.

512
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:25,831
- Don't ever touch me!
- Max! Max!

513
01:04:25,956 --> 01:04:27,290
- Help!
- Max.

514
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:31,998
- Leave me alone!
- Max, come here.

515
01:04:32,123 --> 01:04:36,040
Max. Where're you going, Max?
Stop, Max!

516
01:04:36,165 --> 01:04:38,915
- Max! God damn it!
- Help! Help!

517
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,457
Help!

518
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,332
- Get him!
- I got him.

519
01:04:44,457 --> 01:04:45,790
Come here, Max.

520
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:49,457
Get outta here.

521
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:11,415
- Where'd he go?
- He's over there.

522
01:05:24,748 --> 01:05:25,998
Max.

523
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:28,873
Leave me alone!

524
01:05:28,998 --> 01:05:32,040
- I got him.
- Get off of me!

525
01:05:32,165 --> 01:05:36,040
- Help me! Help!
- Get over here!

526
01:05:38,581 --> 01:05:42,623
- Sit down and shut the hell up.
- Calm down.

527
01:05:42,748 --> 01:05:46,706
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with matches?

528
01:05:46,831 --> 01:05:48,539
The market's going to crash.

529
01:05:48,665 --> 01:05:52,415
I didn't do anything.
I don't play the market.

530
01:05:53,248 --> 01:05:55,623
Be careful where you throw out
your trash.

531
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,248
How could you do that?

532
01:05:58,415 --> 01:06:03,123
You gave faulty information.
You dangled the carrot,

533
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:05,915
but only gave us
part of the code.

534
01:06:06,082 --> 01:06:08,457
Now give us the rest
to set it right.

535
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:11,123
You bastards!
How could you be so stupid?

536
01:06:11,248 --> 01:06:14,831
Max, you just don't get it.

537
01:06:14,957 --> 01:06:20,207
I don't give a shit about you,
just what's in your head!

538
01:06:20,332 --> 01:06:25,165
If you won't help us, we'll
comply with the laws of nature.

539
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:29,790
Survival of the fittest -
and we've got the fucking gun!

540
01:06:30,957 --> 01:06:34,498
- Max! Come here!
- Lenny? Lenny!

541
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,623
- Hey!
- C'mon, get in here. Hurry!

542
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:40,706
Stay down! Stay down.

543
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:42,790
We've been looking for you.

544
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,831
- What's going on?
- You have the number?

545
01:06:45,915 --> 01:06:48,040
What's going on? What is it?

546
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:51,374
What're you doing?
Get off of me!

547
01:06:51,498 --> 01:06:52,915
Where's the number?

548
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,790
It's not on me. It's in my head.

549
01:06:55,915 --> 01:06:59,123
You memorised it?
Did you give it to them?

550
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:01,414
- Who?
- Those Wall Street bastards.

551
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,873
- What do you care?
- Answer me.

552
01:07:05,998 --> 01:07:08,790
Listen. This is really big.

553
01:07:08,915 --> 01:07:12,165
I don't wanna hurt you.
Did you give it to them?

554
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:14,831
They've got part of it. Let go!

555
01:07:14,957 --> 01:07:17,374
Damn it!

556
01:07:17,498 --> 01:07:19,456
- They're using it.
- Using what?

557
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:22,706
Shut up! Impetuous little runt!

558
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:25,915
- Let go!
- No, don't!

559
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:08,816
Max.

560
01:08:09,566 --> 01:08:11,566
Max.

561
01:08:12,357 --> 01:08:14,357
Max.

562
01:08:15,316 --> 01:08:16,316
Max.

563
01:08:18,524 --> 01:08:20,025
You're all right.

564
01:08:22,066 --> 01:08:25,941
I'm Rabbi Cohen.
Cohen, like you.

565
01:08:27,691 --> 01:08:31,774
I'm sorry for what Lenny did.
He's been reprimanded.

566
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:35,858
It's not our way. Are you OK?

567
01:08:35,983 --> 01:08:38,025
Yeah.

568
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:45,315
Max, you have
to give us the number.

569
01:08:47,275 --> 01:08:49,774
What is it?

570
01:08:53,941 --> 01:08:56,899
The Talmud tells us
it began 2,000 years ago,

571
01:08:57,025 --> 01:08:59,191
when the Romans destroyed
the second temple.

572
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:01,858
What is this?

573
01:09:01,983 --> 01:09:05,108
Max, you'll understand
if you listen.

574
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:08,691
The Romans also destroyed
our priesthood, the Cohanim.

575
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:13,108
And with their deaths, they
destroyed our greatest secret.

576
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:17,108
In the centre of the temple
was the heart of Jewish life,

577
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:20,191
the holy of holies.

578
01:09:20,316 --> 01:09:24,649
It was the earthly residence
of our God.

579
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:28,274
The one God.

580
01:09:28,357 --> 01:09:30,649
It housed the Ark
of the Tabernacle,

581
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:33,566
which stored the original 10
Commandments

582
01:09:33,691 --> 01:09:37,316
which God gave to Moses.

583
01:09:37,441 --> 01:09:41,774
Only one man was allowed
to enter this holy of holies

584
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:46,191
on one day, the holiest day
of the year, Yom Kippur.

585
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:48,066
On the Day of Atonement,

586
01:09:48,191 --> 01:09:50,233
all of lsrael
would descend upon Jerusalem

587
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:54,357
to watch the High Priest,
the Cohen Godul,

588
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:57,357
make his trip
to the holy of holies.

589
01:09:57,482 --> 01:10:01,649
If the High Priest was pure,
he would emerge moments later

590
01:10:01,774 --> 01:10:04,858
and we'd have a prosperous year.

591
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:08,316
It meant we were one year closer
to the Messianic age.

592
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:14,816
But, if he was impure,
he would die instantly

593
01:10:14,983 --> 01:10:18,941
and it meant we were doomed.

594
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:22,399
The High Priest
had one ritual to perform there.

595
01:10:22,524 --> 01:10:25,357
He had to intone a single word.

596
01:10:25,482 --> 01:10:27,858
Yeah?

597
01:10:27,983 --> 01:10:32,066
That word was
the true name of God.

598
01:10:34,232 --> 01:10:35,608
So?

599
01:10:35,733 --> 01:10:39,608
The true name,
which only the Cohanim knew,

600
01:10:39,733 --> 01:10:42,774
was 216 letters long.

601
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:50,858
Are you telling me that...

602
01:10:50,983 --> 01:10:55,733
That the number in my head
is the true name of God.

603
01:10:55,816 --> 01:10:59,190
Yes! It's the key
to the Messianic age.

604
01:10:59,316 --> 01:11:02,150
It will take us closer
to the Garden of Eden.

605
01:11:02,274 --> 01:11:05,108
As the temple burnt,
the Talmud tells us

606
01:11:05,232 --> 01:11:07,733
the High Priest
walked into the flames.

607
01:11:07,858 --> 01:11:10,691
He took the key to the top
of the building,

608
01:11:10,816 --> 01:11:14,900
the heavens opened
and received the key

609
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:18,066
from the priest's
outstretched hand.

610
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:21,316
We have been looking
for that key ever since.

611
01:11:21,441 --> 01:11:25,274
And you may have found it.

612
01:11:27,482 --> 01:11:30,316
That's what happened.

613
01:11:33,774 --> 01:11:35,816
I saw God.

614
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:41,357
No. You are not pure. You cannot
see God unless you are pure.

615
01:11:41,482 --> 01:11:44,858
No... I saw everything.

616
01:11:44,983 --> 01:11:50,191
You saw nothing, only a glimpse.
There's so much more.

617
01:11:50,316 --> 01:11:55,399
We can unlock the door
and show God we're pure again.

618
01:11:55,524 --> 01:11:59,566
You're not pure.
How are you pure? I found it!

619
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:06,691
Who do you think you are?
You are only a vessel from God.

620
01:12:06,816 --> 01:12:09,524
You're carrying a delivery
meant for us!

621
01:12:09,733 --> 01:12:12,191
It was given to me.

622
01:12:12,316 --> 01:12:16,066
It's inside of me.
It's changing me.

623
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:21,066
It's killing you! Because you
are not ready to receive it.

624
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:28,399
It's just a number.

625
01:12:29,316 --> 01:12:33,191
I'm sure you've written down
every 216-digit number.

626
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:36,399
You've translated all of them.

627
01:12:36,524 --> 01:12:41,149
You've intoned them all.
Haven't you?

628
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:44,107
What's it gotten you?

629
01:12:44,232 --> 01:12:47,065
The number is nothing.

630
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:53,065
It's the meaning.

631
01:12:53,191 --> 01:12:58,316
The syntax.
It's what's between the numbers.

632
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:03,941
You haven't understood it.

633
01:13:04,065 --> 01:13:07,941
It's because it's not for you.

634
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:12,066
I've got it. I've got it!

635
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:19,316
I understand it. And I'm gonna
see it. Rabbi, I was chosen.

636
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:22,941
17:13. Personal note.
Getting faster...

637
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:27,775
You stare into space like that,
you could go blind.

638
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,024
What can the eyes
do without the brain?

639
01:13:36,858 --> 01:13:39,316
14:50.

640
01:13:42,566 --> 01:13:44,983
15:10.

641
01:13:46,316 --> 01:13:48,733
16:55.

642
01:13:49,107 --> 01:13:51,524
10:35.

643
01:13:51,649 --> 01:13:55,066
Already, I'm beginning to see.

644
01:13:59,691 --> 01:14:01,900
Can I help you?

645
01:14:02,024 --> 01:14:04,024
Sol?

646
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:06,566
Were you a friend?

647
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:11,483
- What do you mean?
- He had a second stroke.

648
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,941
No! No!

649
01:15:37,941 --> 01:15:39,941
No!

650
01:15:52,066 --> 01:15:56,149
Three! Five! Nine!

651
01:15:56,274 --> 01:15:59,982
Ten! Eight! Six! Five! Two!

652
01:16:36,316 --> 01:16:38,316
Five.

653
01:16:40,566 --> 01:16:42,566
Eight.

654
01:16:44,107 --> 01:16:46,107
Nine.

655
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:51,650
Seven.

656
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:56,525
No, Max. No.

657
01:16:56,941 --> 01:16:58,941
Six.

658
01:16:59,066 --> 01:17:02,107
Stay with me, Max.

659
01:17:05,191 --> 01:17:08,066
Max.

660
01:17:15,525 --> 01:17:17,233
No!

661
01:17:17,358 --> 01:17:21,233
It's all right.

662
01:17:23,274 --> 01:17:25,941
It's all right.

663
01:18:54,816 --> 01:18:59,441
17:22. Personal note.
When I was a little kid,

664
01:18:59,442 --> 01:19:02,250
my mother told me
not to stare into the sun.

665
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:09,749
So once, when I was six,
I did.

666
01:19:35,791 --> 01:19:38,208
Max, Max. Look.

667
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:41,708
Pretty, huh?

668
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:45,958
Can we do it, Max? Can we?

669
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:51,916
How about 255 times 183?

670
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,874
I got it! What's the answer?

671
01:20:08,749 --> 01:20:11,791
I don't know. What is it?

672
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:15,624
46,665. See?

673
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:27,417
How about 748 divided by 238?

674
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:32,208
I got it. What's the answer?
