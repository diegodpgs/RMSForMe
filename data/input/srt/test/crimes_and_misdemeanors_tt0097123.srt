1
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:45,013
We're very proud of Judah Rosenthal's
philanthropic efforts...

2
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,384
...his endless hours of fundraising
for the hospital...

3
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,559
...the new medical center...

4
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,591
...and the ophthalmology wing...

5
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:56,992
...which, until this year,
had just been a dream.

6
00:01:57,432 --> 00:02:01,732
But it's Judah Rosenthal, our friend,
that we most appreciate.

7
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:05,667
The husband, the father,
the golf companion.

8
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:08,502
-For medical problems...
-You're blushing.

9
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,704
...call him day or night, weekends,
or holidays. But you can also call...

10
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:18,318
...to ask about the best restaurant
in Paris. Or Athens.

11
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,182
Or which hotel to stay at in Moscow.

12
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:25,485
Or the best recording
of a particular Mozart symphony.

13
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:28,821
My father is so nervous
about having to speak.

14
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,262
l knew he was nervous when you didn't
eat any cocktail weenies.

15
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:37,404
He was so courageous all week.
Then suddenly tonight, stage fright.

16
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:41,507
Judah, you were fine till you
got home from work today.

17
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:42,932
Any mail?

18
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:45,874
The mail's where
l left it this morning.

19
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,275
l haven't had a second all day.

20
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:52,078
lf you're gonna shower, do it.
l have to use it too.

21
00:02:53,154 --> 00:02:55,622
l dread making that speech tonight.

22
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:21,382
Dear Miriam Rosenthal,'

23
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:25,815
I'm at the lowest point of my life
as I write you this letter,

24
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,548
I wish to cause no suffering,
but because I'm going through hell,,,

25
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:33,420
,,,I ask if you can meet me one time,

26
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:37,393
Your husband and I
are more than friends,,,

27
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,036
,,,and have been deeply in love
for over two years now,

28
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:43,534
This must be faced,,,

29
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:47,196
,,,as there are many
ramifications and complications,

30
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:50,400
Many promises were made, et cetera,

31
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:54,337
I need an open exchange
with you to clear things,

32
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,414
For all of us to go on,,,

33
00:03:56,618 --> 00:04:00,918
,,, the situation has got to be
confronted in some fashion,

34
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:04,023
Please contact me at this number,

35
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,785
I want what's best for everyone,

36
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:08,690
Dolores Paley,

37
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,787
That the new ophthalmology wing
has become a reality...

38
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,859
...is not just a tribute to me
but to a spirit of community...

39
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:44,998
...generosity, of mutual caring
and answered prayers.

40
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:49,032
lt's funny l use the term
''answered prayers.''

41
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:50,795
l'm a man of science.

42
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:54,964
l've always been a skeptic,
but l was raised religiously.

43
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:57,474
l challenged it, even as a child...

44
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:01,205
,,,but some of that feeling
stuck with me,

45
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:04,215
I remember my father telling me,'

46
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,286
''The eyes of God are on us always, ''

47
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,484
''The eyes of God.''

48
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:13,121
What a phrase to a young boy.

49
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,956
l mean, what were God's eyes like?

50
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:20,734
Unimaginably penetrating,
intense eyes, l assumed.

51
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:26,939
l wonder if it was just a coincidence
that l specialized in ophthalmology.

52
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:33,810
l'm so proud of you, Judah.
Sharon is, we all are.

53
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:36,174
All together.

54
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:04,203
-Why did you write the letter?
-We've been through it.

55
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:06,539
You wanna destroy my family?

56
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:09,114
l want her to know her husband.

57
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:13,913
lt was lying there all day.
By sheer chance, she didn't open it.

58
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:17,148
You said you'd leave Miriam!
We made plans!

59
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:18,484
-l didn't.
-You did!

60
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,422
l gave up opportunities!

61
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,926
-Pipe dreams.
-Other men wanted me.

62
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:25,964
What do you want?
You think this is easy?

63
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:29,659
l want what you told me
you wanted, to be together.

64
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:33,671
Otherwise, l don't know what!
l'll jump out the window!

65
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:38,005
You've been my whole life
for two years. l can't go back.

66
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:40,305
You turned my life around!

67
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:43,279
l never said l'd leave Miriam.

68
00:06:43,484 --> 00:06:46,920
''There's no passion left.''
Those are your words...

69
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:50,955
...unless you lied.
Or there's something l don't know.

70
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,459
-Have you met someone else?
-What? For God's sake, Dolores.

71
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:57,392
-Dolores--
-What?

72
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:58,929
Now, look.

73
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:03,229
l've lived with her 25 years.
The roots are very deep.

74
00:07:03,438 --> 00:07:05,497
l can't go on leading two lives.

75
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:10,303
You're not doing her a favor by
pretending. l won't be without you.

76
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:14,607
This won't happen without a fight!
l wanna speak to Miriam!

77
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,807
-Nothing's happening, okay?
-No!

78
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:19,384
Yes! Listen to me, please.

79
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:23,648
We'll work something out.
Let me get my thoughts together.

80
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:26,019
Just don't do anything rash.

81
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:27,592
Dolores.

82
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:30,488
What?

83
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,593
lt's gonna be okay.

84
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:39,999
Oh, God.

85
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:42,767
-You were gonna wait--
-Annie--

86
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:45,844
-Then throw me aside!
-Don't dramatize,

87
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:50,108
I've given you the best years
of my life!

88
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:51,376
Get out of here!

89
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:54,282
I know what you are,
Lucky I found out!

90
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:56,514
Those are my clothes!

91
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:01,425
That was great.

92
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,462
-The tuxedos, the evening gowns.
-Great.

93
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:08,101
lt was wonderful to live like that.
This is awful.

94
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:11,396
Let me get a cab. You stay here.

95
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:15,508
-You wanna see a movie again tomorrow?
-Sure, Uncle Cliff.

96
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,699
Jesus.

97
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:20,005
Unless maybe we should
make it a museum day.

98
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:25,117
l promised your dad on his deathbed
you'd get a well-rounded education.

99
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,050
We probably shouldn't
go to the movies every day...

100
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:30,884
...even though l'd love to.

101
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:33,060
While we wait for a cab...

102
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:35,821
...l'll give you
your lesson for today.

103
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,554
Your lesson is this:

104
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:40,495
Don't listen to what
your teachers say.

105
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,794
Just see what they look like.

106
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:46,235
Then you'll know what life
will really be like.

107
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,637
You heard it here first.
l see a cab. lf we run...

108
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:53,569
...we can kick the crutch
from that old lady and get it.

109
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:58,300
-l'm back!
-Where were you?

110
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:02,603
-Just out and around.
-Took your niece to a movie again.

111
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:05,974
l'm crazy about that kid.
She's just great.

112
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,878
My brother's in town.
He asked us to a dinner party.

113
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:13,452
-Jesus.
-Please. You gonna make another scene?

114
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:17,853
-l didn't do that last time.
-You did. Your resentment showed.

115
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,327
l don't resent him. He's a pompous ass.
You don't see it since you love him.

116
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:25,193
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

117
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:27,892
You did. You're running down Lester.

118
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:31,561
-l like your brother Ben.
-You're not jealous of him.

119
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:34,607
l'm jealous because
he's a TV producer?

120
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,610
No. Because he's highly respected
and he's a millionaire...

121
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:41,180
...and doing what you'd like to do.

122
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:44,841
Listen, l can't watch his stuff.
lt's submental.

123
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:48,785
-He wants to talk to you about a job.
-l don't need one.

124
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:51,459
Didn't l get honorable mention at--?

125
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,561
The Cincinnati Documentary
Film Festival?

126
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:58,426
Everybody got honorable mention
who showed up.

127
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:01,660
Boy, things have really
changed around here.

128
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:12,409
Wendy, Cliff, meet Lisa.

129
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:15,777
My sister, Wendy.
My brother-in-law, Clifford.

130
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:19,784
-Lisa's starring in my new series.
-Not really starring.

131
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:23,651
You're one of the stars.
lt's an ensemble piece.

132
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:26,225
-Hello, Lester.
-Hello, darling.

133
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:29,591
-So glad you came.
-Thank you for inviting me.

134
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:33,029
Have a drink. l'll be right there.

135
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:36,898
She gave a bundle to
The Museum of Broadcasting.

136
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:41,140
-She plays a--
-A lawyer for the ACLU.

137
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:43,868
Married to a conservative writer.

138
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,412
-So we can get into issues.
-We'll try to be fair.

139
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:50,949
But knowing Lester,
he'll slant it to the left.

140
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:52,177
Let's hope so.

141
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:54,855
-We're shooting here.
-You'll be here?

142
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:57,321
l wanna shoot more in New York.

143
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,460
-Oh, great.
-l love this town.

144
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:02,789
Out there is such
a Mickey Mouse environment.

145
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:04,397
The reason l'm here--

146
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,263
-Hello, Lester.
-l wanna talk to you. Don't go away.

147
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,598
A bunch of us are getting together...

148
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:14,537
...to build a studio here in the city.

149
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:18,042
ln fact-- l'm sorry,
just give me one second.

150
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:19,680
ldea for series:

151
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:23,215
A high-profile builder,
with grandiose dreams...

152
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:26,387
...a lá Donald Trump.
Shot in New York.

153
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:29,386
-Look who's here.
-That's my brother Ben.

154
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:33,118
Ben, Carol, come here.
Hi, kid. Nice to see you.

155
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,690
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, sweetheart.

156
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:38,992
-Hi, Cliff.
-How you doing? How are your eyes?

157
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:41,999
Not so good. lt's not so optimistic.

158
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:44,468
l've been seeing Dr. Rosenthal.

159
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:47,642
Lester, don't you want
to talk to Clifford?

160
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:50,437
Oh, yeah. Step into my office.

161
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:55,078
-Hi, l'm Lisa.
-Hi. We didn't meet. l'm sorry.

162
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:58,720
-So are you in TV too?
-No.

163
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:00,752
No. l'm a rabbi.

164
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:04,424
You don't wear an outfit or anything?

165
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:07,985
Public television wants to do
a documentary...

166
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:10,495
...on the way l talk and think--

167
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:13,896
lt's part of their
Creative Mind series.

168
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:16,400
So l told them about you.

169
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:19,267
Thanks. l'm working on my own thing.

170
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:21,499
-A little film.
-Wendy told me.

171
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,238
A film about some philosophy
professor, which is admirable.

172
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:31,078
But this is a chance to earn
decent money, reach a big audience.

173
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:34,380
Last thing you need
is me as your biographer.

174
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,959
l make these little films on
toxic waste and starving children.

175
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:43,757
l'll be frank. You're not my
first choice. lt's a favor to Wendy.

176
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:48,733
-You never work. She's embarrassed.
-l've worked, but nobody pays me.

177
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,462
l know you don't respect what l do.

178
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:54,107
But l got a closet full of Emmys.

179
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,506
You think that's bullshit.
Fine. l understand.

180
00:12:57,713 --> 00:13:01,205
Maybe l could use the money
to finish my movie.

181
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,111
l do have some debts.

182
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:04,683
ldea for farce:

183
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:09,220
A poor loser agrees to do
the story of a great man's life.

184
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:12,359
And in the process,
he learns deep values.

185
00:13:15,597 --> 00:13:19,533
-What takes you to Boston?
-I'm lecturing at a symposium,

186
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,135
lncidentally, my name's Dolores.

187
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,032
-Hello, Dolores.
-Hello.

188
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,332
-Pretty name.
-Thank you.

189
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:30,342
-Do you go to Boston often?
-Not very often,

190
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,343
I don't know anyone
in Boston, actually,

191
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:34,981
-Really?
-Yeah,

192
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:44,347
-Morning.
-Hi.

193
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,528
A Miss Paley called,
said it was urgent.

194
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:57,537
Why did you phone me?
l told you l'd call you.

195
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:01,766
l couldn't help it.
l was going out of my skin.

196
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,680
l have to see you later.

197
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:07,605
l have to!

198
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:10,177
Okay.

199
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:13,086
After work is okay.

200
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,552
l see it.

201
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,749
Yeah.

202
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:22,024
l see it.

203
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:25,399
Oh, God.

204
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:27,328
What?

205
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:30,704
l need to take a minute.

206
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:34,575
What's wrong, Judah?

207
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:38,204
l'm in such trouble, Ben.

208
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,811
What is it?

209
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:43,009
l need to talk to someone.

210
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:44,678
Sure.

211
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:49,956
l've known you for years.
You're religious. l'm not.

212
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:53,958
We've differed on many points,
but l do respect you.

213
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,665
-May l confide in you?
-Of course.

214
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,094
Go ahead. Everything's confidential.

215
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,637
l've done a foolish thing.

216
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:09,640
Senseless. Vain.

217
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:11,039
Dumb.

218
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,107
Another woman.

219
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:24,925
Maybe l was flattered, vulnerable.

220
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:27,857
Maybe because she was
helpless and alone.

221
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:30,964
But now my life's
about to go up in smoke.

222
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:35,027
-Can't you break it off?
-The woman won't allow it.

223
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:38,370
She's young. She's very unstable.

224
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,097
She's an hysteric.

225
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:42,033
And vindictive.

226
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,835
And it's my fault.

227
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:47,105
l instigated it. l prolonged it.

228
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:50,409
l tried to back off,
but l was too weak.

229
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:53,213
But l promised her nothing.

230
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:56,220
But did l? l don't even know anymore.

231
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:59,417
ln the heat of passion,
you say things.

232
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:02,825
After two years of living
this double life...

233
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:05,295
...l awakened as if from a dream...

234
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,300
-...and realized what l'd be losing.
-lt's called wisdom.

235
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,631
lt comes to some suddenly.

236
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,833
We realize the difference between
what's deep and lasting...

237
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:19,377
...versus the superficial
payoff of the moment.

238
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:23,881
l kidded myself about loving her,
but deep down l knew.

239
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:26,212
Knowing l behaved selfishly...

240
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:28,981
...for pleasure,
for adventure, for lust.

241
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:31,853
Sometimes, when there's real love...

242
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,154
...and true acknowledgment
of a mistake...

243
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:37,729
...there can be forgiveness too.

244
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,730
l know Miriam.

245
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:43,836
Her values, her feelings,
her place among our friends.

246
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,440
What choice do you have
if the woman's gonna tell?

247
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:51,738
You have to confess the wrong
and hope for understanding.

248
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:55,212
Maybe Miriam's responsible,
in some ways too.

249
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:58,511
You have to discuss it
and hope for the best.

250
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,655
Maybe you can never
go back to the old life...

251
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:06,055
...but maybe there's a new one
with maturity and understanding.

252
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:08,320
Maybe even a richer one.

253
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:14,531
You know what's funny?
Our entire adult lives...

254
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:19,537
...we've been having this same
conversation in one form or another.

255
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:23,973
lt's a fundamental difference
in the way we view the world.

256
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,637
You see it as harsh,
empty of values and pitiless.

257
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:30,943
And l couldn't go on living
if l didn't feel...

258
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:34,644
...a moral structure
with real meaning...

259
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:37,552
...and forgiveness
and some higher power.

260
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,195
Otherwise, there's no basis
to know how to live.

261
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:43,887
And l know a spark of that notion...

262
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:46,329
...is inside you somewhere too.

263
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:49,504
You're talking to me
like your congregation.

264
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:55,469
True. We went from a small infidelity
to the meaning of existence.

265
00:17:56,044 --> 00:18:00,105
Miriam won't think two years
of scheming and dishonesty...

266
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:03,658
...is a small infidelity.

267
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,494
How can you do it?

268
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:21,402
l give up.
God, you're in such wonderful shape.

269
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,769
-For a man my age.
-For any age.

270
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,470
l was athletic as a young student.

271
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:30,480
You still make love
like a young student.

272
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,450
l don't think we should do this here.

273
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,617
-Why not? We're alone.
-l don't know. l feel self-conscious.

274
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,697
Let's go to the cottage.
You can play me the Schumann.

275
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,197
Schubert.

276
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,392
Schumann is flowery.

277
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:50,571
Schubert is....

278
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:53,672
lt reminds me of you. The sad one.

279
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,366
God, you have to teach me all that.

280
00:18:56,577 --> 00:19:00,035
-l'm so ignorant in classical music.
-l'll teach you.

281
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:03,342
Someday, we'll have a lot of time,

282
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,534
Would you like a drink?

283
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,130
Yeah. Fix me whatever you're having.

284
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,818
Why'd you call the house
last night and hang up?

285
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:43,389
Just because you've decided
l'm through in your life...

286
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:46,219
...doesn't mean
l'll roll over and die.

287
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:48,657
What the hell happened to us?

288
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:53,433
We had a wonderful few years.
We knew it couldn't go on forever.

289
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:56,660
-l gave up things for you.
-That's poppycock.

290
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:59,772
Don't give me that. For God's sakes.

291
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:03,102
There were no business opportunities.

292
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:08,044
No lovers begging for your hand.
l prevented nothing. l--

293
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,184
Can we not argue?
l just wanted to talk.

294
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,478
l'm just so rattled.

295
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,818
l had an idea.

296
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:18,851
l thought if we could get away...

297
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,120
...just for a little while
on one of our trips.

298
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,730
Our trips are my warmest memories.

299
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:29,164
Not just in our relationship,
but the best times l've ever had.

300
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,134
You're always so relaxed
away from home.

301
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,103
You come to life.

302
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:39,268
Your whole face changes.
l thought if we could just get away...

303
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,473
...to Boston or Washington
without any preconceived notions.

304
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:45,777
l can't go away, Del.

305
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:49,553
-Just a weekend--
-l can't!

306
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:51,418
-Why not?
-l can't.

307
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,823
-You won't.
-Of course l won't. Right.

308
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,355
Why not?

309
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,502
Because you're very unrealistic,
you know that?

310
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:07,466
Sit down for a second.

311
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:09,476
Let's talk.

312
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:13,975
Look.

313
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,612
l've been--

314
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,085
l've been thinking too.

315
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,946
And if l have caused you...

316
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:27,389
...to miss opportunities that
might have been lucrative for you...

317
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:31,622
...l'm perfectly prepared
to reimburse you. l don't want to--

318
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,300
l'm not after your goddamn money!

319
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:38,632
l wanna speak to Miriam!
lt's her problem too! She should know.

320
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,069
Keep her out of it, all right?

321
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:47,812
She should know her husband's
a liar and an embezzler.

322
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:54,446
Don't you dare call me an embezzler.

323
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,618
l know what went on between
those philanthropies and your stocks.

324
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:04,787
l took nothing, not a nickel.
My conscience is clear.

325
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,230
You needed money to cover
your losses. l saw.

326
00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:10,996
Okay, l needed some temporary help.

327
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,174
For chrissake, after
a lifetime of hard work...

328
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,776
...a man doesn't watch himself
go down the toilet.

329
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:21,038
Moving around funds
is certainly not stealing.

330
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:22,908
Without asking?

331
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:26,211
Every cent was accounted for,
with interest.

332
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:31,888
-l don't think they'd see it that way.
-So this is your plan?

333
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:34,493
You'll hold on to me with threats?

334
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:38,324
Stupid threats and slander--
This is your idea of love?

335
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:41,558
l won't be tossed out!
l'll speak to Miriam!

336
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:45,603
For chrissake! Think what
the hell you're doing to me!

337
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:47,068
Please!

338
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:49,265
l can't figure it out.

339
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,302
l need you.

340
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:54,144
Del.

341
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:58,652
l love New York.
l was born in that building.

342
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:01,845
Behind the statue there
on the pedestal.

343
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:05,116
New York is like thousands
of straight lines...

344
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:07,089
...looking for a punch line.

345
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:10,789
What makes New York
such a funny place...

346
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:14,627
...is that there's so much tension,
pain and craziness.

347
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:19,397
That's the first part of comedy.
But you gotta get some distance.

348
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:24,101
The thing to remember about comedy is,
if it bends, it's funny.

349
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:28,270
lf it breaks, it's not.
You gotta get back from the pain.

350
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:34,051
A bunch of kids up at Harvard
asked me, ''What's comedy?''

351
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:38,282
This is what l'm trying to say
about getting back from it.

352
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:41,359
l said, ''Comedy is tragedy plus time.''

353
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,360
''Tragedy plus time.''

354
00:23:43,564 --> 00:23:46,965
When Lincoln was shot,
you couldn't joke about it.

355
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:49,136
You just couldn't do it.

356
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:53,067
Now time has gone by,
and now it's fair game.

357
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:55,333
lt's tragedy plus time.

358
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:57,010
Okay. We're out.

359
00:23:57,211 --> 00:24:01,392
-That's it? So fast?
-l shot 1 0 rolls on the first question.

360
00:24:01,892 --> 00:24:07,125
l gotta get to CBS. Remember where we
were. Just remember what l was saying.

361
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:08,992
-All right?
-Excellent.

362
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,293
l think l'm too cute.

363
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:14,699
l'll be relaxed tomorrow.
More tragedy stuff.

364
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:18,568
-Halley Reed for Mr. Curtis.
-Would you excuse us?

365
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:22,473
lf you play your cards right,
you could have my body.

366
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,478
Wouldn't you rather
leave it to science?

367
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:28,811
l offer you my heart
and you squash it.

368
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,351
When are you gonna work for me?

369
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:34,490
You'd fire me.
l'm much too opinionated.

370
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:36,353
-No, no.
-l'll wait.

371
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:40,530
-l like mental stimulation.
-You tried shock therapy?

372
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,859
-That's good. That's funny!
-We've gotta go.

373
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:46,969
-l'll be right with you.
-But it's 5--

374
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:49,435
-Arthur, wait in the car.
-Please?

375
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,505
Yes. Wait in the car.

376
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:54,940
Yes. l was holding for Mr. Curtis.

377
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:59,775
Why not come with me to Barbados?
We'll swim, get some sun....

378
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:04,546
-Sorry. l freckle.
-My best shot. l can't do any better.

379
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:06,222
Okay. l'll wait.

380
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:09,483
Please think about it.
Talk to you tomorrow.

381
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:21,236
Yeah. lt's Halley Reed.
You cut me off.

382
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,971
We haven't officially met.

383
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:29,077
-Halley Reed, associate producer.
-l'm Clifford Stern.

384
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,683
Can l ask you something?
Why do you bother with this guy?

385
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:37,684
He's a pompous bore,
and your show does great profiles.

386
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:41,483
Just between us, l wanted
Gabriel García Márquez.

387
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:44,855
-That's perfect.
-They like a little variety.

388
00:25:45,062 --> 00:25:48,691
-He is an American phenomenon.
-But so is acid rain.

389
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:50,696
You really don't like him.

390
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:54,064
''l love him like a brother,''
David Greenglass.

391
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:56,535
So why are you doing this show?

392
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,573
They rarely hire an outside person.

393
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:02,644
l'm doing it strictly for the money.

394
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:06,509
l'm trying to make my own
documentary on a guy...

395
00:26:06,717 --> 00:26:09,277
...who'd be perfect for your show.

396
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,750
-Who?
-His name is Louis Levy.

397
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:15,153
Do you have a little time?

398
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:18,628
Now, the unique thing that happened,,,

399
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,990
,,, to the early Israelites,,,

400
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:24,827
,,,was that they conceived
a God that cares,

401
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:28,095
He cares, but at the same time,,,

402
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:32,708
,,,he also demands
that you behave morally,

403
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,901
But here comes the paradox,

404
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:38,878
What's one of the first things
that that God asks?

405
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,244
That God asks Abraham,,,

406
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:44,580
,,, to sacrifice his only son,,,

407
00:26:44,788 --> 00:26:47,018
,,,his beloved son to him,

408
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:51,217
In other words, in spite
of millennia of efforts,,,

409
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:53,896
,,,we have not succeeded to create,,,

410
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:58,330
,,,a really and entirely
loving image of God,

411
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:02,027
This was beyond our capacity
to imagine,

412
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:06,168
-He's really interesting.
-l know.

413
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:10,711
-He'd be wonderful for the series.
-Wanna dump Lester and do him?

414
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:14,077
-Because l would love--
-We can't dump Lester.

415
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:17,253
But l could get
some financing for you.

416
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:20,651
And if all this comes
together right...

417
00:27:20,858 --> 00:27:24,157
...we got some free spots
in the fall schedule.

418
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:28,593
To get this on your series
would be such a feather in my cap.

419
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,267
That would be my biggest audience.

420
00:27:31,468 --> 00:27:34,028
Great. Let's make it happen.

421
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:37,173
l've got good footage.
Although we just met...

422
00:27:37,374 --> 00:27:40,901
-...l've taken a liking to you.
-And l to him.

423
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:48,445
l thought l'd come by.
l got Jenny a present.

424
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:52,281
-ls that you, Uncle Cliff?
-Yes, l got you something.

425
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:57,119
l got you a great book, an absolutely
terrific book. How are you?

426
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:00,353
lt has great pictures
of old New York in it.

427
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:03,761
Look at this.
This is old Fifth Avenue.

428
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,492
-lt's great.
-Carriages and top hats.

429
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:09,433
There's a whole section
on speakeasies.

430
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,905
That's the Flatiron Building.
lt's very famous.

431
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,772
l had a creative breakthrough today.

432
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:19,938
l heard you got some action
on your personal ad. Terrific.

433
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,710
Here's the old Madison Square Garden.

434
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,889
-Jen, don't you have some homework?
-Yeah.

435
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,287
-We'll look at this later.
-Yeah. Thanks a lot.

436
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:33,360
What's the matter?

437
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:34,826
l'm a wreck.

438
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:37,023
What is it?

439
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,363
l'm a wreck.

440
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,094
Barbara.

441
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:44,069
Barbara, what's the matter?

442
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:46,367
-l feel sick.
-What is it?

443
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:50,707
l'm still shaking.
l've been shaking like this for days.

444
00:28:50,914 --> 00:28:53,007
What's wrong?

445
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:59,722
l've been going out with this man
l met through the personal columns.

446
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:04,488
Very attractive, He's very nice,

447
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:08,756
I went out with him three times,
He was never fresh,

448
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:11,958
He was always a perfect gentleman,

449
00:29:23,981 --> 00:29:26,916
So we both came back here,,,

450
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:32,111
,,,and Jenny was away, She was
sleeping over at a friend's house,

451
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:35,314
It was 1,'00 in the morning
or something,,,

452
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:38,620
,,,and we both had had
a little to drink,

453
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:41,764
-l wanna tie you to the bed.
-Really?

454
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:44,866
And rip your dress off.

455
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:50,471
Have you ever been bound up,
tied up and made love to?

456
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:53,199
l'm, uh-- l'm a--

457
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,878
l'm a sensible gal.

458
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:58,738
No more, you're not.

459
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:02,451
God, Murray. God....

460
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:06,930
Barbara, l'm shocked at this!
You're my sister.

461
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:11,665
You're this nice middle-class mother.
What are you telling me?

462
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:16,209
l couldn't move.
l was tied tightly to the bedposts.

463
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:19,849
Oh, Jesus, by a strang--
A guy you didn't know.

464
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,315
Now you're gonna tell me
that he robbed you.

465
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,748
No.

466
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:28,623
He got on top of me and--

467
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:32,959
-And what?
-l can't say it. l just can't say it.

468
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:36,189
What? Tell me.
What's so terrible?

469
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,927
He sat over me
and went to the bathroom.

470
00:30:42,972 --> 00:30:44,769
That's so disgusting!

471
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:48,273
Oh, my God! That's the worst
thing l ever heard!

472
00:30:48,478 --> 00:30:53,142
-Then he took his clothes and left.
-Barbara, you idiot!

473
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:56,318
He could've cut your throat,
murdered you.

474
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,420
-l'd have preferred it.
-You're such a dope!

475
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:02,420
l wish l could have sympathy for this.

476
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,924
That's easy for you to say,
but l'm so lonely.

477
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:09,530
You don't know what it's like
to be by yourself.

478
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:12,223
l'm sure you're lonely.
lt's painful...

479
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:15,598
...but promise me you'll never
place another ad.

480
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:20,037
-lt's ridiculous!
-My whole life is passing me by...

481
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:25,146
...l don't have anyone to love. l know
that's hard for you to comprehend...

482
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:28,909
...because you're married.
But it's lonely out there.

483
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,078
You have a wife.
You love her, and that's so nice.

484
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:36,747
Things are not so good
between my wife and myself.

485
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,954
Don't get any illusions. We've been
coming apart for the last year.

486
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:47,501
Neither of us has energy to do
anything about it, but it's not great.

487
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:07,153
A strange man defecated on my sister.

488
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:09,655
Why?

489
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:13,887
l don't know.

490
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:19,433
ls there any reason l could give you
that would answer that satisfactorily?

491
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,931
You know, it's just so--

492
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:24,206
Human sexuality is just...

493
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:28,901
...it's so mysterious.
Which, l guess, is--

494
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:31,672
l guess it's good, in a way.

495
00:32:33,016 --> 00:32:35,985
Yeah, well, l gotta be up at 7.

496
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,096
lt had to be a dark secret
for you to stoop to call me...

497
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:52,768
...to invite me here.

498
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:56,700
Jack, don't hit me while l'm down.
You're my brother.

499
00:32:56,906 --> 00:32:59,170
-l was there for you.
-l'm here.

500
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:02,173
Don't make sharp cracks.
l didn't stoop.

501
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:04,005
l'm in serious trouble.

502
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:07,012
She won't take money
or listen to reason.

503
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:12,120
l considered telling Miriam, but
she'd never be able to live with it.

504
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:15,985
She's also blabbing about my
financial indiscretions.

505
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:19,423
Not that l stole,
but l was indiscreet.

506
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:22,325
lf they look, they might find things.

507
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:26,798
-What would you like me to do?
-l don't know, she's killing me.

508
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:30,666
-Want me to have somebody talk to her?
-Like what?

509
00:33:30,873 --> 00:33:32,500
Straighten her out.

510
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:36,312
You mean threaten her?
That's all l need.

511
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,278
-How else do you keep her quiet?
-l don't know.

512
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:42,348
Jack, l don't know.

513
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:44,542
Well....

514
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:47,879
Christ, Jack, what do you suggest?

515
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:50,451
What did you call me for?

516
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,597
l hoped you'd have more experience
with something like this.

517
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,268
You called me to do some dirty work.
That's all you ever call for.

518
00:34:03,506 --> 00:34:05,633
Look how bitter you are.

519
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:11,203
You've staked me plenty of times.
l don't forget my obligations.

520
00:34:11,414 --> 00:34:14,383
Threatening her would
only make it worse.

521
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:17,678
Forget about it.
What do you want me to say?

522
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:21,721
How can l forget about it?
l'm fighting for my life.

523
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:24,916
She will destroy
everything l've built.

524
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:30,191
That's what l'm saying. lf she won't
listen to reason, take the next step.

525
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,860
-Threats, violence, what can we do?
-She can be gotten rid of.

526
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:40,407
-l know many people who can be bought.
-l'm not going to comment on that.

527
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:42,904
Well, what did you want me to do?

528
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:46,570
Not to do dirty work,
despite what you think.

529
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:51,553
Anyway, it's gone beyond
just Miriam now.

530
00:34:51,754 --> 00:34:54,917
She's talking financial doings.

531
00:34:55,758 --> 00:35:00,889
l'm out of ideas. l don't know
what l expected from you.

532
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:06,433
You don't know what goes on in this
world sitting here with four acres...

533
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:09,797
...and your country club
and your rich friends.

534
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:13,339
Out there in the real world,
it's very different.

535
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:16,774
-l've met a lot of characters--
-l know you have.

536
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:19,504
From 7th Avenue, from Atlantic City.

537
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:22,446
l'm not like you, l look at reality.

538
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:25,712
l can't afford to be aloof.

539
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:30,518
You come to me with a big problem,
then you get highhanded on me.

540
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:35,258
l don't mean to be highhanded.
l'm irritable, okay?

541
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:38,298
Okay, forget l said anything.

542
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:45,105
Let me just get
something straight here.

543
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:48,970
Am l understanding you right?

544
00:35:50,346 --> 00:35:53,144
Are you suggesting getting rid of her?

545
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,211
You won't be involved,
but l'll need some cash.

546
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:07,094
-What will they do?
-What will they do? They'll handle it.

547
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:14,433
l'm talking about a human being.
She's not an insect.

548
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:16,867
You don't just step on her.

549
00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:21,571
l know. Playing hardball
was never your game.

550
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:24,178
You never get your hands dirty.

551
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,716
Apparently, this woman is for real.
This thing isn't just gonna go away.

552
00:36:31,354 --> 00:36:33,117
l can't do it.

553
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:37,051
l can't think that way.

554
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:50,996
I don't want to know anything,

555
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:54,768
This is a work of art,
The ropes come off,

556
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:59,311
-I tie weights to her with catgut,
-That's a horrible word!

557
00:36:59,515 --> 00:37:03,747
Get the angle on this,
She disappears two weeks, maybe three,

558
00:37:03,953 --> 00:37:08,694
Then up she pops, none of this
stuff on her, No marks, A suicide,

559
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:14,229
-Now, isn't that beautiful?
-It's loathsome, Be sure no one sees,

560
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:17,368
This only happens in the movies.

561
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,471
We should get back.
Lester's gonna leave the hotel soon.

562
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:26,872
lt's okay. l've been shooting
him all week. l'm tired of it.

563
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,413
l shouldn't have told you
my weakness is going to matinees.

564
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:35,713
l go all the time with my niece.
lt's like playing hooky.

565
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,185
We were late yesterday too.

566
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,188
We weren't late.
We didn't miss anything.

567
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:45,454
Have another cheeseburger.
lt's our lunch hour.

568
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:49,691
l got everyone at the network
excited over Professor Levy.

569
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:52,666
l have great stuff to show you later.

570
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,429
Listen...

571
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,165
...l brought you a present.

572
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,010
Great. Now l can get rid of
my few remaining teeth.

573
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,956
-Look at his face.
-A treadmill.

574
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:16,059
-You telling me something?
-You were bored with the bicycle.

575
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,728
lt's just as boring.

576
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,660
-You're in great shape.
-For a man my age.

577
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:24,199
-That's exactly what l was gonna say.
-Thank you.

578
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,562
This thing's great
for relieving tension.

579
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:34,140
-lt's just like the one at the club.
-Where are we gonna put this?

580
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:37,144
l'll have some 20 men
take it upstairs.

581
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:42,184
-lt looks like kinetic sculpture.
-lt's not staying down here.

582
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:46,287
Dad, it's for you. A Miss Paley.

583
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,692
-She's a patient.
-On this phone?

584
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,559
Yeah, she's going through a crisis.

585
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:57,360
-Can't the service take it?
-lt's probably urgent.

586
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,599
l'm at the gas station
down the road from your house.

587
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,207
l can be there in five minutes.

588
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:09,005
l'm going to,
unless you meet me right now.

589
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,977
No, Judah.

590
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:12,911
No, Judah.

591
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:18,881
No. l wanna talk to you in person,
or l'm coming over.

592
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,408
-Calm down, okay?
-You said we're going away.

593
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,272
l want us to be alone.
When we get back...

594
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,779
...l want you to end it with Miriam.

595
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,918
l can't go on like this
and wait forever!

596
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,419
-You don't know what it's like!
-Talk to somebody.

597
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:55,081
-Like a therapist or somebody.
-Don't trick me!

598
00:39:55,294 --> 00:39:57,353
Christ, l'm shaking.

599
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:00,826
Listen...

600
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:04,694
...l brought you a birthday present.

601
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:08,038
l know how much you love Schubert.

602
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:24,287
Sometimes, when there's real love,,,

603
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:27,014
,,,and true acknowledgment
of a mistake,,,

604
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,386
,,, there can be forgiveness too,

605
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:31,720
I know Miriam,

606
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,696
Her values, her feelings,
her place among our friends,

607
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:39,302
What choice do you have
if the woman's gonna tell?

608
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:43,702
You have to confess the wrong
and hope for understanding,

609
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,639
I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel,,,

610
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,370
,,,a moral structure
with real meaning,,,

611
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:53,347
,,,and forgiveness
and some higher power,

612
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,953
Otherwise, there's no basis
to know how to live,

613
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,646
And I know a spark of that notion,,,

614
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,088
,,,is inside you somewhere too,

615
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,367
Could you really go through with it?

616
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,303
What choice do l have, man?

617
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,041
Tell me.

618
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:21,435
Give the people you've hurt
a chance to forgive you.

619
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:24,142
Miriam won't forgive me.

620
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,246
She'll be broken.

621
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,586
She worships me.

622
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:34,124
She'll be humiliated before everyone.
This woman plans to make a stink.

623
00:41:35,394 --> 00:41:38,693
-Did you make promises to her?
-No.

624
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:42,556
Maybe l led her on
more than l realized.

625
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:45,293
She's so emotionally hungry.

626
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:50,367
-But it's deeper than just Miriam.
-Meaning financial improprieties?

627
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,006
No.

628
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,838
Maybe l--

629
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,340
Maybe l did make
some questionable moves.

630
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,652
Only you would know that, Judah.

631
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,118
l don't anymore, Ben.

632
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,789
Sometimes it's worse than--
Worse than jail.

633
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,192
lt's a human life.

634
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,596
You don't think God sees?

635
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:25,568
-God is a luxury l can't afford.
-Now you're talking like your brother.

636
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,411
Jack lives in the real world.

637
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:32,174
You live in the kingdom of heaven.

638
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:36,479
l managed to keep free
of that real world...

639
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,088
...but suddenly, it's found me.

640
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:43,754
You fool around with her,
then when you think it's enough...

641
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:46,396
...you wanna sweep her under the rug?

642
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:50,328
There's no other solution but Jack's.

643
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,338
l push one button
and l can sleep again nights.

644
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,439
Could you sleep with that?

645
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:00,104
ls that who you really are?

646
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,611
l will not be destroyed
by this neurotic woman.

647
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,511
But the law.

648
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,855
Without the law, it's all darkness.

649
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,854
You sound like my father.

650
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,924
What good is the law if it
prevents me from receiving justice?

651
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:27,899
ls what she's doing to me just?
ls this what l deserve?

652
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,087
Jack? lt's Judah.

653
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:47,717
We should move ahead
with what we discussed.

654
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,262
How much will you need?

655
00:44:13,065 --> 00:44:14,862
lt's not funny, guys.

656
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:18,969
You're not thinking funny.
You gotta think with your ear.

657
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:23,301
Do you understand?
Here's the difference. lt's very easy.

658
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:28,412
lf it bends, it's funny.
lf it breaks, it's not funny.

659
00:44:28,614 --> 00:44:33,210
lt's very simple. Wait a minute.
Jeff, this is Alva.

660
00:44:33,419 --> 00:44:36,946
-Hi, pleased to meet you.
-Don't shoot this part.

661
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,489
Alva's in the new series.
l don't know what part...

662
00:44:41,694 --> 00:44:45,528
...l just know l want her.
lt's wonderful. You look great.

663
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:48,996
Trust me, they love you. Be right out.

664
00:44:49,735 --> 00:44:52,795
Don't do that while we're shooting.

665
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:56,736
Do you understand?
Think of Oedipus. Oedipus is funny.

666
00:44:56,942 --> 00:44:59,103
That's the structure of funny.

667
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:04,374
''Who did this terrible thing?
My God, it was me.'' That's funny--

668
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:07,984
Don't do it, they're shooting!
What are you doing?

669
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:14,422
You will notice
that what we are aiming at,,,

670
00:45:14,827 --> 00:45:18,593
,,,when we fall in love
is a very strange paradox,

671
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:23,166
The paradox consists of the fact
that when we fall in love,,,

672
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:26,861
,,,we are seeking to re-find,,,

673
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:29,472
,,,all or some of the people,,,

674
00:45:29,675 --> 00:45:32,371
,,, to whom we were attached
as children,

675
00:45:32,578 --> 00:45:36,207
On the other hand,
we ask our beloved,,,

676
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:39,578
,,, to correct all of the wrongs,,,

677
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:45,087
,,, that these early parents
or siblings inflicted upon us,

678
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:48,350
So love contains
in it the contradiction,,,

679
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,188
,,, the attempt to return
to the past,,,

680
00:45:51,397 --> 00:45:54,855
,,,and the attempt to undo the past,

681
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:58,701
See? No limos, no bimbos,
no awards or anything.

682
00:45:58,904 --> 00:46:04,137
-This guy is a thinker, an intellect.
-When you ultimately show this...

683
00:46:04,343 --> 00:46:09,576
...to the people that make the
decision, emphasize his view of life.

684
00:46:09,782 --> 00:46:14,549
-lt's life-affirming. They'd love it.
-This is what l need.

685
00:46:14,753 --> 00:46:19,918
A little interest in my work,
a little encouragement or something.

686
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:24,027
l got a bottle of champagne
as a prize from Paris.

687
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:29,030
l got honorable mention
for a documentary l did on leukemia.

688
00:46:29,234 --> 00:46:33,898
-Want some champagne?
-l never say no to champagne or caviar.

689
00:46:34,106 --> 00:46:39,237
Perfect, l have no caviar. l have
oat bran. lt's better for your heart.

690
00:46:41,814 --> 00:46:45,306
He was very eloquent
on the subject of love.

691
00:46:45,517 --> 00:46:48,748
Yeah. Wish l had read him
before l got married.

692
00:46:48,954 --> 00:46:52,651
-lt would've saved my gall bladder.
-What did you say?

693
00:46:52,858 --> 00:46:57,659
Nothing. He wrote an interesting
book on human relationships.

694
00:46:57,863 --> 00:47:01,060
He speaks very highly
of love at first sight.

695
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:04,292
l fell for my ex-husband
at first sight.

696
00:47:04,503 --> 00:47:06,869
l should've taken a second look.

697
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:10,166
Actually, it was my fault
as much as his.

698
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:13,344
You still wear a wedding ring.
Why is that?

699
00:47:13,545 --> 00:47:18,278
Well, l guess l'm just
not ready to take it off.

700
00:47:18,617 --> 00:47:22,178
lt's good. lt keeps me
from getting asked out.

701
00:47:22,387 --> 00:47:26,187
You must have had a terrible
marriage to avoid dating.

702
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:31,090
Well, no. He was great,
very brilliant. He's an architect.

703
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:33,924
But if you're gonna have an affair...

704
00:47:34,132 --> 00:47:37,761
...not with my best friend,
in my four-poster bed.

705
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:41,406
And they didn't have
to finish my pistachio nuts.

706
00:47:41,607 --> 00:47:46,010
That inconsiderate? l hope it
hasn't soured you on marriage.

707
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:50,705
-l hear myself sounding like a bore.
-Just the opposite. Hello.

708
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,714
Yeah, she's here. How did you know?

709
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:55,947
Hold on one second.

710
00:47:56,154 --> 00:47:57,815
lt's Lester.

711
00:47:59,157 --> 00:48:00,624
Hello.

712
00:48:00,826 --> 00:48:02,418
Yeah?

713
00:48:02,828 --> 00:48:05,353
Sure, if you want me to.

714
00:48:05,898 --> 00:48:08,332
Okay. At the office at what time?

715
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:12,527
-9? That's no problem.
-9:00? The building will be dark.

716
00:48:12,738 --> 00:48:15,673
-Nobody's at the office.
-l didn't hear you.

717
00:48:15,874 --> 00:48:18,502
You'll be in a dark room with Lester.

718
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,237
-The office is a spooky place at 9:00.
-Definitely.

719
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:26,349
-Sure, the hotel is even nearer.
-Don't go to the hotel.

720
00:48:26,552 --> 00:48:31,717
What was that? Room 1 91 1 .
Sure. Okay, l'll see you there.

721
00:48:31,924 --> 00:48:35,018
-You're not going to his hotel.
-What's wrong?

722
00:48:35,227 --> 00:48:39,857
-l better go with you. l know him.
-Don't be ridiculous.

723
00:48:40,065 --> 00:48:44,195
He'll read you your Miranda rights
and tear your clothes off.

724
00:48:44,403 --> 00:48:47,099
He wants to produce something of mine.

725
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:48,739
Your first child.

726
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:52,399
l can't be with a guy
who wears shoes and no socks.

727
00:48:52,611 --> 00:48:56,547
-Much less one who says ''nucular.''
-He also says ''foilage.''

728
00:48:56,748 --> 00:49:00,013
You have a copy
of Singing in the Rain?

729
00:49:00,218 --> 00:49:04,245
lt's the one print l own.
lt's a very good 1 6mm print.

730
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:07,619
l play it now and then
to cheer myself up.

731
00:49:07,826 --> 00:49:11,353
l saw it years ago.
l remember loving it.

732
00:49:11,563 --> 00:49:14,657
They play it on television frequently.

733
00:49:14,866 --> 00:49:17,926
-You wanna watch it? l can play it.
-Really?

734
00:49:18,136 --> 00:49:20,832
-You wanna have dinner?
-Aren't you busy?

735
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:25,237
No, and you've got till 9:00.
l-- You know, why not?

736
00:49:25,444 --> 00:49:29,608
There's an lndian restaurant,
l'll send out. You know, we could...

737
00:49:29,982 --> 00:49:31,142
...you know....

738
00:49:39,758 --> 00:49:42,124
l love this lndian food.

739
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:46,787
lt's great. Want some more
tandoori mouse? Just kidding.

740
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:51,129
-You want some of the curry?
-No, too hot.

741
00:49:51,336 --> 00:49:53,736
My teeth are melting.

742
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,508
Boy, this is the perfect way
to see this movie.

743
00:49:59,211 --> 00:50:01,042
lt's great, isn't it?

744
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,505
When you see Lester later...

745
00:50:03,715 --> 00:50:08,948
...be careful. Because this guy tells
you he wants to exchange ideas.

746
00:50:09,154 --> 00:50:11,936
What he wants is to exchange fluids.

747
00:52:05,549 --> 00:52:09,349
-Yes?
-l have a delivery of some flowers.

748
00:52:09,553 --> 00:52:12,647
Chris and you can't agree
on your honeymoon.

749
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:16,020
-We can agree on something.
-We don't disagree.

750
00:52:16,227 --> 00:52:18,923
lt's just that l told Chris...

751
00:52:19,129 --> 00:52:22,621
...l wanna go someplace warm
that has beaches.

752
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:26,325
But l also want to do
things like, maybe, hike.

753
00:52:26,804 --> 00:52:29,932
-l hadn't thought of Australia.
-No, not there.

754
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,304
We should go where we wanted
to go in the first place.

755
00:52:34,512 --> 00:52:38,812
-Where did you want to go?
-We wanted to go to ltaly.

756
00:52:39,016 --> 00:52:40,813
Dad, it's Jack.

757
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:43,652
-He's on the phone.
-Who?

758
00:52:44,355 --> 00:52:47,119
-Jack.
-l thought we had it decided.

759
00:52:47,324 --> 00:52:48,848
ltaly is wonderful.

760
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:53,496
Right. We can have sun.
We can have snow, anything.

761
00:52:54,098 --> 00:52:56,862
A lot of my friends
have gone to ltaly.

762
00:52:57,067 --> 00:52:59,763
You won't go there because of that?

763
00:53:00,004 --> 00:53:03,940
Everything came out fine.
lt's over and done with.

764
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:06,473
No problems. Forget about it.

765
00:53:06,977 --> 00:53:08,706
Oh, my God.

766
00:53:09,914 --> 00:53:11,677
Oh, my God.

767
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:14,109
l'm in shock, Jack.

768
00:53:14,652 --> 00:53:18,679
l'm telling you, it's like
the whole thing never existed.

769
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:22,450
lt's a small burglary, nothing more.

770
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:26,986
So go on back to your life,
and put it behind you.

771
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:30,261
l can't speak.

772
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:32,725
l need a drink.

773
00:53:32,937 --> 00:53:34,165
Jack....

774
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,032
What am l gonna do?
l've got guests here now.

775
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:49,449
God have mercy on us.

776
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:35,178
-Mom, you said Mary had acupuncture.
-She's tried it.

777
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,326
-She's been going for a few months.
-She hasn't gone back.

778
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:43,520
ls everything okay, sweetheart?
You look kind of upset.

779
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:46,097
Yeah, l'm fine. lt's just Jack.

780
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:50,063
She's still wearing that collar
when she drives.

781
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:52,569
Well, sometimes it does work.

782
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:56,242
We were talking about
Oriental medicine.

783
00:54:56,444 --> 00:55:00,847
A friend consulted a Chinese physician
with an eye problem.

784
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:04,109
He inserted a cat whisker
into her tear duct.

785
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,119
She's been telling the story
all week. lt's her favorite.

786
00:55:08,323 --> 00:55:10,154
-What happened?
-lt cured her.

787
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:14,488
-lt did.
-You told me he uses wires too.

788
00:55:14,696 --> 00:55:15,685
Why would you--?

789
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:19,025
-ln acupuncture, you use needles.
-But very fine.

790
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:23,170
-But that's a different procedure.
-What do you think?

791
00:55:26,474 --> 00:55:28,533
Judah, what do you think?

792
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:32,907
l think l've done a terrible thing.

793
00:55:33,381 --> 00:55:35,110
What's wrong, honey?

794
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:39,682
l left these papers at the office...

795
00:55:39,888 --> 00:55:42,448
...which l absolutely need tonight.

796
00:55:42,657 --> 00:55:46,855
l can't believe l did this.
How negligent of me.

797
00:55:47,061 --> 00:55:49,586
l have a conference in the morning.

798
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:54,291
-You're not going tonight.
-l must. l have an hour's work to do.

799
00:55:54,502 --> 00:55:57,130
-But we're having a party.
-l'm so sorry.

800
00:55:57,338 --> 00:56:00,830
-Please forgive me. l--
-Don't apologize.

801
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:03,602
l don't like him driving at night.

802
00:56:03,811 --> 00:56:08,145
-Stanley, l'm so sorry about this.
-Chris, would you go with him?

803
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:10,715
-Would you like some company?
-No.

804
00:56:10,919 --> 00:56:13,444
Darling, forgive me. l must go.

805
00:56:13,655 --> 00:56:16,123
lt was a wonderful evening.

806
00:56:16,324 --> 00:56:18,952
lf you're here when l get back--

807
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,721
-Don't worry about us.
-l couldn't apologize more.

808
00:56:22,931 --> 00:56:25,559
Let's just finish the coffee.
Sit down.

809
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:27,166
He'll be back.

810
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:39,861
I'll say it once again,

811
00:58:40,535 --> 00:58:43,527
The eyes of God see all.

812
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:48,734
Listen, Judah. There is absolutely
nothing that escapes his sight.

813
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:51,935
He sees the righteous and the wicked.

814
00:58:52,146 --> 00:58:54,706
And the righteous will be rewarded...

815
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:59,478
...but the wicked will be
punished for eternity.

816
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:24,766
Hello?

817
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:07,142
l want your opinion.
l'm doing a special show on jazz.

818
01:01:07,348 --> 01:01:09,339
l admire her opinion so.

819
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:13,179
Did you tell them l want
to produce an idea you have?

820
01:01:13,387 --> 01:01:17,118
She wants to do a different
Chekhov story every month.

821
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,759
-He wrote a million.
-That's sweet.

822
01:01:19,961 --> 01:01:23,795
-l'm putty in your hands.
-What will l do with putty?

823
01:01:23,998 --> 01:01:27,695
She's always got a zinger.
This vixen, this minx.

824
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:32,396
We should really be going.
We have to pick up those airsick bags.

825
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:37,909
l gotta get up to teach Emily Dickinson
to upper middle-class crack addicts.

826
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:39,315
-One of my favorite poets.
-Me too.

827
01:01:39,315 --> 01:01:40,475
-One of my favorite poets.
-Me too.

828
01:01:40,683 --> 01:01:44,585
-''Because l could not stop for death.''
-''He kindly stopped for me.''

829
01:01:44,787 --> 01:01:46,379
The word ''kindly,'' right?

830
01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:50,252
''The carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality.''

831
01:01:50,459 --> 01:01:52,689
''We slowly drove, he knew no haste.''

832
01:01:52,895 --> 01:01:55,261
''l had put away
my labor, and my leisure too...''

833
01:01:55,464 --> 01:01:56,556
''...for his civility.''

834
01:01:56,766 --> 01:02:00,566
-He was a great English student.
-Not that l graduated.

835
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:04,672
l couldn't graduate, but now
my school teaches a class in...

836
01:02:04,874 --> 01:02:08,640
-...existential motifs in my sitcoms.
-Really?

837
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:11,538
-Where did you study?
-Columbia.

838
01:02:11,747 --> 01:02:14,682
Columbia? What did you major in?

839
01:02:14,884 --> 01:02:17,444
Law. l graduated from the law school.

840
01:02:17,653 --> 01:02:22,090
-You didn't practice?
-l did. But then l met my husband.

841
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:27,228
We moved to Europe for a while.
lt's a long, boring story.

842
01:02:27,429 --> 01:02:29,863
l wish you'd go back to your job.

843
01:02:30,065 --> 01:02:34,593
l used to edit newsreel footage.
Floods, fires and famines.

844
01:02:34,804 --> 01:02:35,793
Depressing.

845
01:02:36,005 --> 01:02:39,168
-We don't all have to go.
-No. l do.

846
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:42,606
We'll go. You two stay
and talk business.

847
01:02:42,812 --> 01:02:45,645
-l could go too, if you'd like.
-Let's go.

848
01:02:45,848 --> 01:02:49,113
-Let's go for a drink.
-l wouldn't mind.

849
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:52,617
-l'm just exhausted.
-From what? lt's early.

850
01:02:52,822 --> 01:02:54,016
Some other time.

851
01:02:54,223 --> 01:02:57,420
-One little drink.
-Really. Some other time.

852
01:02:59,028 --> 01:03:00,962
Lester was so pushy tonight.

853
01:03:01,163 --> 01:03:04,826
He says it's business with Halley,
but he's after her.

854
01:03:05,034 --> 01:03:09,767
-She really likes him. l can tell.
-You're kidding. She likes him?

855
01:03:09,972 --> 01:03:13,931
What's not to like?
He's attractive, rich, charming.

856
01:03:14,143 --> 01:03:17,579
You're prejudiced.
She put him down pretty good.

857
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:21,272
He said, ''One drink.''
She said, ''Some other time.''

858
01:03:21,483 --> 01:03:23,747
l loved that. Socked it to him.

859
01:03:23,953 --> 01:03:27,047
-Fine. Enough.
-That was pretty witty.

860
01:03:27,256 --> 01:03:32,023
-How can you say she likes him?
-She was staring at him all night.

861
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:37,291
-She probably can't believe her eyes.
-You wouldn't pick up on those things.

862
01:03:37,499 --> 01:03:40,195
You're not the least bit romantic.

863
01:03:40,402 --> 01:03:43,633
You're the one who stopped
sleeping with me.

864
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:48,037
lt'll be a year on April 20th.
Same date as Hitler's birthday.

865
01:03:48,244 --> 01:03:50,906
l'm not discussing that anymore.

866
01:03:51,113 --> 01:03:53,946
l'll bet you she's with him now.

867
01:03:54,149 --> 01:03:57,050
For how much?
l'm serious. For how much?

868
01:03:57,253 --> 01:03:59,915
You really know how to get my goat.

869
01:04:25,281 --> 01:04:27,374
Hi. lt's Clifford.

870
01:04:27,683 --> 01:04:30,516
Yes. l knew you'd be in.

871
01:04:31,287 --> 01:04:34,814
Tonight was a lot of fun.
Wasn't Lester so silly?

872
01:04:35,024 --> 01:04:38,460
He's so self-important.
He was pushing all night.

873
01:04:38,661 --> 01:04:41,186
l was frankly embarrassed for him.

874
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,994
What is he doing there?

875
01:04:50,005 --> 01:04:53,065
You're talking business at midnight?

876
01:04:55,811 --> 01:04:59,838
That could be very dangerous.
You want me to come over?

877
01:05:03,819 --> 01:05:06,515
Okay, if you can handle it.

878
01:05:07,923 --> 01:05:10,756
Okay. l'll see you tomorrow.

879
01:05:19,635 --> 01:05:21,330
l'm in love with Halley.

880
01:05:21,537 --> 01:05:24,267
Lester is making his move.
l can see it.

881
01:05:24,473 --> 01:05:26,873
He wants her just for a conquest.

882
01:05:27,076 --> 01:05:29,874
lt's so shallow,
and l'm crazy about her.

883
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,446
l can't compete with a guy
who's rich and famous.

884
01:05:33,649 --> 01:05:38,018
-He's no competition for you.
-God bless you for saying that.

885
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:40,085
But you'll find out...

886
01:05:40,289 --> 01:05:45,226
...that great depth and smoldering
sensuality doesn't always win.

887
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:48,087
You know his brother Ben the rabbi?

888
01:05:48,297 --> 01:05:51,425
He's a wonderful guy.
He's going blind.

889
01:05:51,633 --> 01:05:56,195
He's got a terrible eye disease.
He'll be blind in a few months.

890
01:05:56,405 --> 01:05:59,533
He has a great attitude.
He's really a mensch.

891
01:06:00,776 --> 01:06:02,505
All right. Look left.

892
01:06:03,645 --> 01:06:05,636
Now straight ahead, Ben.

893
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:09,350
Now to the right.

894
01:06:10,352 --> 01:06:11,614
That's good.

895
01:06:19,595 --> 01:06:20,619
My mother said,,,

896
01:06:22,164 --> 01:06:24,598
...that l should go to the doctor.

897
01:06:25,234 --> 01:06:27,725
Because my eyes weren't so good.

898
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:30,427
Well, you're an ophthalmologist.

899
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:33,972
Do you agree the eyes
are the windows of the soul?

900
01:06:34,176 --> 01:06:38,237
l believe they're windows.
l'm not sure they see the soul.

901
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:41,007
My mother taught me l have a soul.

902
01:06:41,216 --> 01:06:44,151
And it will live on after l'm gone.

903
01:06:44,353 --> 01:06:48,949
lf you look deeply enough in my eyes,
you can see it.

904
01:06:53,162 --> 01:06:55,062
So, what's the verdict?

905
01:06:55,697 --> 01:06:59,292
l want to resolve this
before my daughter's wedding.

906
01:07:00,736 --> 01:07:04,695
-Julie's getting married?
-Time passes quickly, doesn't it?

907
01:07:04,907 --> 01:07:08,206
Remember she was just a baby?
Well, yours too.

908
01:07:11,613 --> 01:07:14,912
Are you okay, Judah?
You don't look so good.

909
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:18,348
l just haven't been
sleeping that well.

910
01:07:18,921 --> 01:07:21,116
Tell me, if l'm not prying...

911
01:07:21,323 --> 01:07:24,724
...did you ever resolve
your personal difficulties?

912
01:07:25,594 --> 01:07:30,429
Yes, actually. lt resolved itself.
The woman listened to reason.

913
01:07:30,632 --> 01:07:32,065
Did she?

914
01:07:32,768 --> 01:07:35,532
That's wonderful. So you got a break.

915
01:07:35,871 --> 01:07:40,331
Sometimes, to have a little good luck
is the most brilliant plan.

916
01:07:40,676 --> 01:07:44,612
Relax. You're white.
You're gonna have a breakdown.

917
01:07:44,813 --> 01:07:49,011
You expect me to be my old self?
l jump when the phone rings.

918
01:07:49,785 --> 01:07:53,881
-No good can come of this.
-l kept you uninvolved.

919
01:07:54,089 --> 01:07:57,547
The guy who's responsible
is back in New Orleans.

920
01:07:57,759 --> 01:07:59,727
lt's pure evil, Jack.

921
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:04,188
A man kills for money.
He doesn't even know his victims.

922
01:08:04,399 --> 01:08:07,698
He kills, you pay him
and he kills again.

923
01:08:07,903 --> 01:08:10,064
What was your alternative?

924
01:08:10,772 --> 01:08:12,967
How did l get in so deep?

925
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:16,637
What dream was l following?

926
01:08:17,312 --> 01:08:21,942
You said it yourself a million times,
''You only go around once.''

927
01:08:23,118 --> 01:08:25,609
l went to her place after.

928
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:28,813
l had to retrieve
some incriminating things.

929
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:31,315
l saw her there.

930
01:08:32,394 --> 01:08:33,918
Just staring up...

931
01:08:34,129 --> 01:08:36,097
...an inert object.

932
01:08:37,266 --> 01:08:39,826
There was nothing behind her eyes.

933
01:08:40,035 --> 01:08:42,833
lf you looked into them,
all you saw was...

934
01:08:43,605 --> 01:08:45,470
...a black void.

935
01:09:21,887 --> 01:09:23,377
Can l help you?

936
01:09:25,924 --> 01:09:28,518
l used to live in this house once.

937
01:09:28,727 --> 01:09:30,991
Really? When?

938
01:09:31,763 --> 01:09:33,230
Many years ago.

939
01:09:35,534 --> 01:09:39,436
My brother and l used to race
through these rooms.

940
01:09:39,905 --> 01:09:44,308
He was a wonderful kid.
We were very close in those days.

941
01:09:47,512 --> 01:09:51,141
My father had high hopes for him
but it never seemed...

942
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,113
...to work out for him.

943
01:09:57,089 --> 01:09:59,319
Do you mind if l take a minute?

944
01:09:59,524 --> 01:10:02,584
Everything seems to be
flooding through me.

945
01:10:02,794 --> 01:10:04,284
Sure.

946
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:28,543
Sol, get on with it, I'm hungry,

947
01:10:28,987 --> 01:10:32,423
-Do you mind, May?
-This is such mumbo jumbo.

948
01:10:32,624 --> 01:10:34,057
Bring on the food.

949
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:36,887
l apologize for
my disrespectful sister.

950
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:42,294
This is the 20th century. Don't fill
their heads with superstition.

951
01:10:42,501 --> 01:10:44,696
The intellectual, the teacher.

952
01:10:44,903 --> 01:10:47,804
Spare us your Leninist philosophy
for once.

953
01:10:48,006 --> 01:10:50,634
lf you don't obey,
God will punish you?

954
01:10:50,842 --> 01:10:53,811
-Not me. He punishes the wicked.
-Like Hitler?

955
01:10:54,012 --> 01:10:55,479
We're having a Seder!

956
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,808
Six million Jews killed,
they got away with it.

957
01:10:59,017 --> 01:11:02,077
-How'd they get away with it?
-Open your eyes!

958
01:11:02,287 --> 01:11:05,313
Six million Jews.
They got off with nothing.

959
01:11:05,524 --> 01:11:08,891
-How could men do such a thing?
-Might makes right.

960
01:11:09,094 --> 01:11:13,360
-Until the Americans--
-l don't like this talk at Seder.

961
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:14,827
Okay! All right!

962
01:11:15,033 --> 01:11:18,594
-I think this is interesting,
-Yeah, you do,

963
01:11:18,804 --> 01:11:20,601
There's this joke,

964
01:11:20,806 --> 01:11:22,967
A prizefighter enters the ring.

965
01:11:23,175 --> 01:11:26,633
His brother asks the family priest
to pray for him.

966
01:11:26,845 --> 01:11:30,281
He said, ''Okay.
But if he can punch, it'll help.''

967
01:11:30,482 --> 01:11:34,885
So you're saying you challenge
the moral structure of everything?

968
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:39,148
Moral structure? You use
that nonsense on your pupils?

969
01:11:39,357 --> 01:11:42,588
You don't find human impulses
basically decent?

970
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:47,356
-There's basically nothing.
-A cynic, a nihilist. Back to Russia.

971
01:11:47,566 --> 01:11:50,933
Well, listen. l happen
to agree with May...

972
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:53,195
...when it comes to mumbo jumbo.

973
01:11:53,405 --> 01:11:57,136
But you come to every Seder.
You pray in Hebrew.

974
01:11:57,342 --> 01:12:01,278
l go through the motions.
Like any ritual, it's a habit.

975
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:05,541
So you say there's no morality
anywhere in the whole world?

976
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:10,210
For those who want it, it's there.
Nothing's handed down in stone.

977
01:12:10,422 --> 01:12:12,515
Sol's kind of faith is a gift.

978
01:12:12,724 --> 01:12:15,852
lt's like an ear for music
or talent to draw.

979
01:12:16,061 --> 01:12:19,724
You use logic on him all day
and he still believes.

980
01:12:19,931 --> 01:12:23,924
-Must everything be logical?
-And if a man commits a crime?

981
01:12:24,136 --> 01:12:25,694
lf he--

982
01:12:25,904 --> 01:12:27,337
lf he kills?

983
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:32,136
-ln some way, he'll be punished.
-lf he's caught, Sol.

984
01:12:32,344 --> 01:12:36,940
''What originates from a black deed
will blossom in a foul manner.''

985
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:40,277
You're relying too heavily
on the Bible.

986
01:12:40,485 --> 01:12:44,922
Whether it's the Old Testament
or Shakespeare, murder will out.

987
01:12:45,123 --> 01:12:48,650
-Who said anything about murder?
-You did.

988
01:12:51,096 --> 01:12:52,427
Did l?

989
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:57,601
l say, if he can do it
and get away with it...

990
01:12:57,802 --> 01:13:01,704
...and chooses not to be bothered
by ethics, he's home free.

991
01:13:01,907 --> 01:13:04,637
History is written by the winners.

992
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:08,574
Had the Nazis won,
future generations would understand...

993
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,941
...World War ll quite differently.

994
01:13:11,149 --> 01:13:15,017
Your aunt is brilliant,
but she's had an unhappy life.

995
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:20,419
And if all your faith is wrong--
l mean, just what if? lf?

996
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:23,753
l'll still have a better life
than doubters.

997
01:13:23,962 --> 01:13:27,955
Wait a minute. Are you saying
you prefer God to the truth?

998
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:33,001
-l'll always choose God over truth.
-l agree with him.

999
01:13:33,638 --> 01:13:36,505
l say, what goes around comes around.

1000
01:13:41,613 --> 01:13:46,016
-You okay? l was worried. lt's late.
-l had some business.

1001
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:47,708
Mrs. Ames is waiting.

1002
01:13:47,919 --> 01:13:50,251
-Any messages?
-You got an odd one.

1003
01:13:50,455 --> 01:13:53,720
A Detective O'Donnell
wanted to talk to you.

1004
01:13:53,925 --> 01:13:58,487
l tried to ask him what about,
but he only wants to talk with you.

1005
01:14:18,316 --> 01:14:21,945
-lt's not a great movie, but it's fun.
-l liked it.

1006
01:14:22,153 --> 01:14:24,485
Maybe l want to be an actress.

1007
01:14:24,689 --> 01:14:29,592
l don't want you to be an actress.
Be on the Supreme Court or a doctor.

1008
01:14:29,794 --> 01:14:31,921
Show business is dog-eat-dog.

1009
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:37,067
lt's worse than dog-eat-dog. lt's
dog-doesn't-return-other-dog's-calls.

1010
01:14:37,269 --> 01:14:39,294
l should check my service.

1011
01:14:39,504 --> 01:14:42,302
l don't know why.
l never have messages.

1012
01:14:42,507 --> 01:14:46,034
-l call, l hear the girls giggling.
-How's Halley?

1013
01:14:46,244 --> 01:14:49,042
She's great. l'm gonna make my move.

1014
01:14:49,247 --> 01:14:53,343
But l have this ethical dilemma
because l'm married.

1015
01:14:53,551 --> 01:14:56,520
Clifford Stern. Any messages?
Can you check?

1016
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:59,656
My heart says one thing.
My head, another.

1017
01:14:59,858 --> 01:15:03,589
lt's hard to get your heart
and head together in life.

1018
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:06,764
ln my case, they're not
even friendly. Yes?

1019
01:15:10,635 --> 01:15:12,068
Really?

1020
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:19,142
No.

1021
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,204
Okay. Thank you.

1022
01:15:26,751 --> 01:15:28,082
What's wrong?

1023
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:33,323
Professor Levy...

1024
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:35,785
...committed suicide.

1025
01:15:37,028 --> 01:15:39,326
But we must always remember,,,

1026
01:15:39,531 --> 01:15:43,126
,,, that we--
When we are born,,,

1027
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:45,963
,,,we need a great deal of love,,,

1028
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:49,766
,,,in order to persuade us
to stay in life,

1029
01:15:49,974 --> 01:15:53,774
Once we get that love,
it usually lasts us,

1030
01:15:53,978 --> 01:15:56,606
But the universe is a cold place,

1031
01:15:56,815 --> 01:16:00,273
It's we who invest it
with our feelings,

1032
01:16:00,485 --> 01:16:03,147
And under certain conditions,,,

1033
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:06,950
,,,we feel that the thing
isn't worth it anymore,

1034
01:16:07,158 --> 01:16:11,720
l came as soon as l heard. l thought
you wouldn't want to be alone.

1035
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:16,390
God, it's been terrible. l called--
The guy was not sick at all.

1036
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:20,264
He left a note that said,
''l've gone out the window.''

1037
01:16:20,472 --> 01:16:24,738
A major intellectual, and this
is his note. What does it mean?

1038
01:16:24,943 --> 01:16:26,410
He was a role model.

1039
01:16:26,611 --> 01:16:31,571
-You'd think he'd leave a decent note.
-Did he have family or anything?

1040
01:16:31,783 --> 01:16:36,652
They were killed in the war. lt's
strange. He's seen the worst in life.

1041
01:16:36,855 --> 01:16:41,019
He always said yes to life.
Now today he said no.

1042
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:44,855
lmagine his students,
how shattered they will be.

1043
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:49,022
Where l grew up, in Brooklyn,
nobody committed suicide.

1044
01:16:49,234 --> 01:16:53,534
-Everyone was too unhappy.
-This will put a damper on the show.

1045
01:16:53,738 --> 01:16:56,730
l got 600,000 feet of film
on this guy...

1046
01:16:56,941 --> 01:16:59,535
...and he's telling how great life is.

1047
01:16:59,744 --> 01:17:02,474
l'll cut it up,
use it for guitar picks.

1048
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,615
l was thinking,
no matter how elaborate...

1049
01:17:05,817 --> 01:17:08,581
...a philosophical system
you work out...

1050
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:12,188
...in the end,
it's gotta be incomplete.

1051
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:16,486
l've been so annoyed all day.
l'm sorry for seeming cranky.

1052
01:17:16,694 --> 01:17:21,188
No, l understand. l just thought
you might want some company.

1053
01:17:24,235 --> 01:17:26,135
No. Don't do that.

1054
01:17:26,704 --> 01:17:29,639
lt's something l've wanted
to do for weeks.

1055
01:17:29,841 --> 01:17:31,900
-You must know.
-You're married.

1056
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:33,407
Yes, l'm married.

1057
01:17:33,611 --> 01:17:36,944
But, you know, that's
not gonna last. l mean....

1058
01:17:37,148 --> 01:17:38,513
Well, you know...

1059
01:17:38,716 --> 01:17:40,911
...l'm not ready.

1060
01:17:42,654 --> 01:17:45,487
ls there something you're
not telling me?

1061
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:46,679
No.

1062
01:17:46,891 --> 01:17:49,951
ls there someone else?
Don't say it's Lester.

1063
01:17:50,161 --> 01:17:52,356
lt's me. lt's just me.

1064
01:17:52,564 --> 01:17:56,523
l guess l haven't gotten over
my divorce yet, you know?

1065
01:17:56,734 --> 01:18:00,329
And also, l feel unsettled
about my career.

1066
01:18:00,538 --> 01:18:02,563
l'm very ambitious.

1067
01:18:02,774 --> 01:18:06,505
And that's an area that
l'd like to get consolidated.

1068
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:09,475
l just feel, you know, unsettled.

1069
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:25,160
Don't confuse me.

1070
01:18:25,363 --> 01:18:29,629
-l'm not trying to confuse you.
-l don't know what l'm doing.

1071
01:18:30,034 --> 01:18:33,197
l better go. l should just leave.

1072
01:18:33,404 --> 01:18:36,168
-You just got here.
-l know, but l--

1073
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:40,944
-l'm sorry, l didn't mean--
-No, that's okay. l'll see you soon.

1074
01:18:41,145 --> 01:18:43,477
l'll just-- l'll be seeing you.

1075
01:18:47,318 --> 01:18:48,785
Please come in.

1076
01:18:50,455 --> 01:18:52,582
We read about it in the paper.

1077
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:57,193
lt's a terrible thing.
She'd been coming here for years.

1078
01:18:57,395 --> 01:18:59,363
-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.

1079
01:19:00,164 --> 01:19:04,498
Just a few questions, doctor.
Records show she phoned you here...

1080
01:19:04,702 --> 01:19:07,569
...and at your home a number of times.

1081
01:19:07,772 --> 01:19:11,572
-She worried about her eyes.
-What was she suffering from?

1082
01:19:11,776 --> 01:19:16,804
Nothing serious. She had
light flashes, and they alarmed her.

1083
01:19:17,015 --> 01:19:19,449
l never found anything very wrong.

1084
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:22,620
l told her it was just
a common occurrence.

1085
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:26,620
-She was a hypochondriac?
-No. l wouldn't say that.

1086
01:19:26,824 --> 01:19:28,485
But she was concerned.

1087
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,823
There's nothing she said
you think might be relevant?

1088
01:19:33,031 --> 01:19:34,828
Personal life? Friends?

1089
01:19:35,033 --> 01:19:37,001
No, not really.

1090
01:19:37,869 --> 01:19:39,769
How did she come to you?

1091
01:19:41,339 --> 01:19:45,002
l honestly can't remember.
Possibly another patient.

1092
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:46,642
Can l get that name?

1093
01:19:46,844 --> 01:19:50,302
lt was a while ago,
and l treat so many patients.

1094
01:19:50,515 --> 01:19:53,348
-Might it be in your records?
-No.

1095
01:19:53,551 --> 01:19:56,543
No. l doubt it very much.

1096
01:19:57,455 --> 01:20:00,185
-Sorry to take up your time.
-That's okay.

1097
01:20:00,391 --> 01:20:03,292
lf you remember anything
that might help...

1098
01:20:03,494 --> 01:20:05,325
-...will you call me?
-Sure.

1099
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:07,464
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

1100
01:20:17,508 --> 01:20:19,305
You're having a breakdown!

1101
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:23,071
They know she phoned me.
l lied. They saw through it.

1102
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:26,682
-l can't take this.
-Pull yourself together.

1103
01:20:26,884 --> 01:20:30,012
l did it. lt's irrevocable,
and l'm gonna pay.

1104
01:20:30,221 --> 01:20:33,987
l had to fight an urge
to come clean to the police.

1105
01:20:34,192 --> 01:20:38,686
l'm in this with you. l helped you.
l don't wanna go to jail.

1106
01:20:38,896 --> 01:20:43,629
You get ideas about confessing,
and you'll drag me down with you.

1107
01:20:43,835 --> 01:20:45,803
But l won't let that happen.

1108
01:20:46,004 --> 01:20:49,371
-ls that a threat?
-Be a man. You're in the clear.

1109
01:20:49,574 --> 01:20:51,735
-You'll have me killed?
-Nonsense.

1110
01:20:51,943 --> 01:20:54,776
What did you mean by that remark?

1111
01:20:54,979 --> 01:20:57,573
You've helped me in the past. Fine.

1112
01:20:57,782 --> 01:20:59,807
l did you a favor. All right?

1113
01:21:00,018 --> 01:21:04,318
The time to confess was to Miriam
about your mistress.

1114
01:21:04,522 --> 01:21:06,854
Not about this! This is murder.

1115
01:21:07,058 --> 01:21:11,392
You paid for it, l engineered it.
lt's over! Forget about it!

1116
01:21:11,896 --> 01:21:15,457
-One sin leads to a deeper sin.
-You sound like Papa.

1117
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:19,068
Adultery, fornication, lies, killing.

1118
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:22,364
-Can you shut up?
-Or what? You'll shut me up?

1119
01:21:22,573 --> 01:21:25,633
One phone call,
like pushing a button right?

1120
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:05,752
l don't know what's wrong
with you these days.

1121
01:22:06,862 --> 01:22:09,023
l believe in God, Miriam.

1122
01:22:09,898 --> 01:22:14,733
l know it. Because without God,
the world is a cesspool.

1123
01:22:14,937 --> 01:22:18,100
You drink every day.
You never used to.

1124
01:22:18,307 --> 01:22:19,865
lt's something new.

1125
01:22:20,075 --> 01:22:22,543
-God, it's hot.
-Maybe we should go--

1126
01:22:22,745 --> 01:22:26,579
-Don't tell me what to do, damn it!
-Will you calm down?

1127
01:22:29,451 --> 01:22:32,352
l don't feel well.
l'm gonna get some air.

1128
01:22:32,554 --> 01:22:34,283
No, you stay here.

1129
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:01,272
This homeless story is too long,
I want five pages,

1130
01:23:01,483 --> 01:23:03,212
Five real pages,

1131
01:23:03,419 --> 01:23:07,446
His secretary types it tighter,
He doesn't take a thing out,

1132
01:23:07,656 --> 01:23:09,556
I want Johanson off the show,

1133
01:23:09,758 --> 01:23:13,854
He has cancer, Send him flowers,
He's not funny,

1134
01:23:14,063 --> 01:23:15,257
I want him off,

1135
01:23:15,464 --> 01:23:20,527
Can't anyone write funny anymore? I'm
supposed to write everything myself?

1136
01:23:20,736 --> 01:23:23,227
Write, direct and produce it myself?

1137
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:27,671
I can't believe this!
Look at the people out there!

1138
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:32,540
These people are looking for
something funny in their lives!

1139
01:23:32,748 --> 01:23:35,740
They're waiting for something funny!

1140
01:23:54,303 --> 01:23:56,134
This is terrible.

1141
01:23:56,405 --> 01:23:58,305
What are you doing to me?

1142
01:23:58,507 --> 01:24:01,408
This isn't a profile
of a creative mind!

1143
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:06,804
It's tough for a woman in this
profession, Men always hit on them,

1144
01:24:07,015 --> 01:24:09,984
What is this? When did you shoot that?

1145
01:24:10,185 --> 01:24:13,643
l was lurking around the corner.
l couldn't resist.

1146
01:24:13,856 --> 01:24:16,324
I don't wanna do it
in a vulgar way,,,

1147
01:24:16,525 --> 01:24:19,289
,,,and take it off
from what I see here,

1148
01:24:19,495 --> 01:24:22,055
I wanna find out what's in here,

1149
01:24:22,264 --> 01:24:25,927
So I gotta spend some time,
have dinner together,

1150
01:24:26,135 --> 01:24:28,228
l'm taking over this film.

1151
01:24:28,437 --> 01:24:32,168
-You can't finish my film.
-l can't? Read your contract.

1152
01:24:32,374 --> 01:24:35,969
-You promised.
-The idea was to show the real me.

1153
01:24:36,178 --> 01:24:39,705
l'm not perfect, but l don't
promote values that--

1154
01:24:39,915 --> 01:24:41,280
Let me quote you:

1155
01:24:41,483 --> 01:24:44,281
''--deaden the sensibilities
of democracy.''

1156
01:24:44,486 --> 01:24:47,011
You're fired. Get out of here!

1157
01:24:47,222 --> 01:24:49,554
Go! Thank you! Goodbye!

1158
01:24:49,892 --> 01:24:54,090
If it bends, it's funny,
If it breaks, it isn't,

1159
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:58,591
Don't get discouraged.
You have your own vision.

1160
01:24:58,801 --> 01:25:03,170
Why was he so mad? As if nobody
was ever compared to Mussolini.

1161
01:25:03,372 --> 01:25:08,503
l'd no idea you'd cut it like this. l
could've told you they'd never use it.

1162
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:11,042
They want an upbeat profile.

1163
01:25:11,246 --> 01:25:14,807
He's gonna re-cut it
and make himself into a saint.

1164
01:25:15,017 --> 01:25:19,454
Wendy's right. l'm jealous of him
with his limos and his money.

1165
01:25:19,655 --> 01:25:23,421
-You have your own style.
-Listen. Marry me. l'm serious.

1166
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:25,820
That's all l want. Marry me.

1167
01:25:26,028 --> 01:25:29,259
l'm crazy about you.
My marriage won't last.

1168
01:25:29,465 --> 01:25:33,265
l gotta talk to you.
Can we sit down for a second?

1169
01:25:33,469 --> 01:25:36,700
l'm not joking.
l'm really nuts about you.

1170
01:25:36,905 --> 01:25:38,805
l'm going away.

1171
01:25:41,043 --> 01:25:43,341
Yeah? Meaning what?

1172
01:25:44,146 --> 01:25:48,674
l've got a chance to produce
a couple of shows in London...

1173
01:25:48,884 --> 01:25:51,478
...and, you know, l couldn't say no.

1174
01:25:52,754 --> 01:25:57,384
-How long are you going for?
-Well, probably three or four months.

1175
01:25:57,926 --> 01:26:00,588
Three or four months?

1176
01:26:01,763 --> 01:26:05,927
Jesus. You're kidding.
What a discouraging thought.

1177
01:26:06,134 --> 01:26:08,227
But l think it's a good thing...

1178
01:26:08,437 --> 01:26:12,874
...because l need-- Well,
it will give me a little distance.

1179
01:26:13,075 --> 01:26:16,909
About 3000 miles, to be exact.
When are you leaving?

1180
01:26:17,112 --> 01:26:19,876
Oh, l guess 1 0 days or so.

1181
01:26:21,183 --> 01:26:22,650
God, l'm--

1182
01:26:27,656 --> 01:26:31,490
God, l'm gonna miss you.
l don't know what to say.

1183
01:26:32,528 --> 01:26:35,827
l'm not gonna see you
for three or four months?

1184
01:26:36,932 --> 01:26:41,460
l feel like l've, you know,
been handed a prison sentence.

1185
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:14,224
Ben, your daughter
will make a beautiful bride.

1186
01:27:15,103 --> 01:27:18,630
This is Barbara,
the sister of my brother-in-law.

1187
01:27:19,241 --> 01:27:24,304
Congratulations. l wish
your daughter all the happiness.

1188
01:27:25,547 --> 01:27:26,536
Thank you.

1189
01:27:28,617 --> 01:27:33,247
Jesus, l'm so self-conscious.
Every single thing on me is rented:

1190
01:27:33,455 --> 01:27:36,515
A rented tux, rented shoes,
rented underwear.

1191
01:27:36,725 --> 01:27:38,955
You look fine. Do me a favor.

1192
01:27:39,161 --> 01:27:43,325
This is your last occasion
with my family. Let's get along.

1193
01:27:43,532 --> 01:27:45,966
Oh, and this is Dr. Rosenthal.

1194
01:27:46,168 --> 01:27:48,227
-l'm Miriam.
-This is Miriam.

1195
01:27:48,437 --> 01:27:50,405
This is Marian and Peter.

1196
01:27:50,606 --> 01:27:53,131
How do you do? lt's a pleasure.

1197
01:27:53,342 --> 01:27:55,367
-Judah?
-Yes, Ben?

1198
01:27:55,577 --> 01:27:58,740
l'm so glad you could make it.
lt means a lot.

1199
01:28:01,464 --> 01:28:04,956
What is the matter with you?
You seem so depressed.

1200
01:28:05,168 --> 01:28:08,604
Wendy and l finally
decided to call it quits.

1201
01:28:08,805 --> 01:28:13,640
Even though the last few years
have been terrible, it makes me sad.

1202
01:28:13,843 --> 01:28:16,368
-l'll have a vodka and tonic.
-Me too.

1203
01:28:16,579 --> 01:28:19,946
You told me it's been
platonic for a year.

1204
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:22,448
Once the sex goes, it all goes.

1205
01:28:22,652 --> 01:28:27,715
Last time l was inside a woman was
when l visited the Statue of Liberty.

1206
01:28:36,366 --> 01:28:39,893
Your father's celebrating
enough for two people.

1207
01:28:40,103 --> 01:28:43,869
He and Ben will get high
and argue about belief in God.

1208
01:28:44,073 --> 01:28:46,337
My dad takes after his Aunt May.

1209
01:28:46,543 --> 01:28:51,503
She rejected the Bible because it had
an unbelievable sense of character.

1210
01:28:52,215 --> 01:28:57,016
l walked in. l said, ''The Waldorf
Astoria.'' You see the centerpieces?

1211
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:00,212
Did you see the matches?
Lester paid for it.

1212
01:29:00,423 --> 01:29:03,824
l can't believe a brother
would pay for a wedding.

1213
01:29:04,027 --> 01:29:07,428
That's the sort of thing
Lester's always doing.

1214
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:12,590
-You've known him for a long time?
-Since high school.

1215
01:29:25,915 --> 01:29:29,009
They're pretty.
They're very, very pretty.

1216
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:31,187
-Hi, Cliff.
-Cliff, hello.

1217
01:29:31,387 --> 01:29:34,015
Lester, how are you? Good to see you.

1218
01:29:34,224 --> 01:29:37,887
-My fiancée, Halley.
-Congratulations. My wife, Nancy.

1219
01:29:38,862 --> 01:29:41,456
-Jesus, you look wonderful.
-Thank you.

1220
01:29:42,131 --> 01:29:43,598
When did you return?

1221
01:29:44,033 --> 01:29:47,764
l got back this morning.
l've been trying to call you.

1222
01:29:47,971 --> 01:29:51,236
l finally won her heart.
What a romantic story.

1223
01:29:51,441 --> 01:29:53,466
We saw each other in London.

1224
01:29:53,676 --> 01:29:56,839
l sent her white roses
around the clock...

1225
01:29:57,046 --> 01:30:01,107
...all the time, for days.
Then l found out she was allergic.

1226
01:30:01,317 --> 01:30:03,444
-Hi.
-Hi. Congratulations.

1227
01:30:03,653 --> 01:30:04,881
Good to see you.

1228
01:30:05,088 --> 01:30:07,454
So l started pleading with her.

1229
01:30:07,657 --> 01:30:10,285
l just begged her day and night.

1230
01:30:10,493 --> 01:30:13,485
And l think it was
the caviar that did it.

1231
01:30:13,696 --> 01:30:16,164
l've envied this guy for years.

1232
01:30:16,366 --> 01:30:19,858
He'd show up with a beautiful woman
all the time.

1233
01:30:20,069 --> 01:30:23,038
-But l envy you more now.
-Thank you.

1234
01:30:49,365 --> 01:30:52,027
Standing here
in the presence of God...

1235
01:30:52,235 --> 01:30:56,569
...the guardian of our homes,
ready to enter the bonds of wedlock...

1236
01:30:56,773 --> 01:31:00,265
...answer each of you,
in reverence for God...

1237
01:31:00,476 --> 01:31:03,673
...and in hearing of
the assembly gathered here...

1238
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,314
...so joyously with you.

1239
01:31:14,757 --> 01:31:16,850
-l know the perfect guy.
-Who?

1240
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:21,019
-He's brilliant, attractive.
-There's a hitch. l'm waiting.

1241
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:25,223
There is, but it sounds worse
than it is. He's in prison.

1242
01:31:25,435 --> 01:31:29,132
-That's a drawback.
-Nothing terrible. lnsider trading.

1243
01:31:29,339 --> 01:31:33,002
He made a fortune in the market.
He'll be out soon.

1244
01:31:33,209 --> 01:31:35,404
Very soon. A couple of years.

1245
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:37,738
You mean with good behavior.

1246
01:31:56,532 --> 01:31:58,796
l wanted to talk to you.

1247
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:09,442
What is there really to say?
You know, l'm just stunned still.

1248
01:32:12,181 --> 01:32:15,548
He's not what you think.
He's wonderful.

1249
01:32:15,752 --> 01:32:19,017
He's warm and caring...

1250
01:32:19,222 --> 01:32:23,181
-...and romantic.
-He's a success, that's what he is.

1251
01:32:23,393 --> 01:32:27,261
-He's rich and he's a success.
-Give me a little credit.

1252
01:32:27,463 --> 01:32:30,955
l always did give you
a little credit until today.

1253
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:36,161
We used to laugh at him. The silly
shows he puts on, the way he talks.

1254
01:32:36,372 --> 01:32:38,306
He's endearing.

1255
01:32:39,742 --> 01:32:43,041
This is my worst fear realized.

1256
01:32:48,584 --> 01:32:51,246
l wanted to give you this letter back.

1257
01:32:54,757 --> 01:32:57,851
-lt's my one love letter.
-lt's beautiful.

1258
01:32:58,061 --> 01:33:00,689
l'm just the wrong person.

1259
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,493
lt's probably just as well.

1260
01:33:08,471 --> 01:33:11,565
l plagiarized most of it
from James Joyce.

1261
01:33:12,909 --> 01:33:16,401
You probably wondered
about the Dublin references.

1262
01:33:18,281 --> 01:33:21,808
l hope we can always be friends.

1263
01:34:06,013 --> 01:34:09,414
Off by yourself, huh? You're like me.

1264
01:34:10,584 --> 01:34:13,382
l always get sad at these events.

1265
01:34:13,587 --> 01:34:15,646
You look very deep in thought.

1266
01:34:18,525 --> 01:34:20,959
l was plotting the perfect murder.

1267
01:34:23,464 --> 01:34:24,954
Movie plot?

1268
01:34:25,899 --> 01:34:27,196
Movie?

1269
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:32,237
That's what Ben told me.
He says you make films.

1270
01:34:32,439 --> 01:34:36,773
Yeah, but not that kind.
You know, a different kind.

1271
01:34:38,545 --> 01:34:40,945
l have a great murder story.

1272
01:34:42,249 --> 01:34:44,547
-Yes?
-A great plot.

1273
01:34:45,552 --> 01:34:46,883
Yeah.

1274
01:34:48,856 --> 01:34:52,587
Hey, l've had too many to drink.
l mean, forgive me.

1275
01:34:52,793 --> 01:34:54,920
l know you want your privacy.

1276
01:34:55,129 --> 01:34:59,463
No, it's okay.
l'm not doing anything special.

1277
01:35:00,033 --> 01:35:05,369
Except my murder story
has a very strange twist.

1278
01:35:07,174 --> 01:35:08,471
Yeah?

1279
01:35:10,244 --> 01:35:14,408
Let's say there's this man
who is very successful.

1280
01:35:14,615 --> 01:35:16,344
He has everything.

1281
01:35:23,891 --> 01:35:26,086
-Let me ask you something.
-What?

1282
01:35:26,293 --> 01:35:28,261
-Am l a phony?
-Are you what?

1283
01:35:28,462 --> 01:35:31,556
-Am l a phony?
-Are you a little high?

1284
01:35:32,199 --> 01:35:33,689
-He hates me.
-Who?

1285
01:35:33,901 --> 01:35:38,065
Your annoying husband.
Every time l'm with him, l get tense.

1286
01:35:38,272 --> 01:35:40,467
-He's angry.
-At what?

1287
01:35:40,674 --> 01:35:41,800
Are you kidding?

1288
01:35:42,009 --> 01:35:45,410
He's got these fantasies
about changing the world.

1289
01:35:45,612 --> 01:35:48,240
ln the end, his films come to nothing.

1290
01:35:48,448 --> 01:35:52,578
He's gotta grow up.
This is the real world, the big time.

1291
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:56,620
They don't pay for high aspirations.
You gotta deliver.

1292
01:35:56,824 --> 01:36:00,419
Not to mention the fact that--
You're still young.

1293
01:36:00,627 --> 01:36:04,859
-You're not getting what you deserve.
-Lester, l met somebody.

1294
01:36:08,068 --> 01:36:10,229
That is music to my ears.

1295
01:36:12,005 --> 01:36:14,496
And after the awful deed is done...

1296
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:18,144
...he finds that he's plagued
by deep-rooted guilt.

1297
01:36:18,345 --> 01:36:21,803
Little sparks of
his religious background...

1298
01:36:22,015 --> 01:36:26,076
...which he'd rejected,
are suddenly stirred up.

1299
01:36:27,521 --> 01:36:30,513
He hears his father's voice.

1300
01:36:30,858 --> 01:36:34,726
He imagines that God
is watching his every move.

1301
01:36:34,928 --> 01:36:37,795
Suddenly, it's not
an empty universe...

1302
01:36:37,998 --> 01:36:40,831
...but a just and moral one...

1303
01:36:41,134 --> 01:36:43,159
...and he's violated it.

1304
01:36:43,837 --> 01:36:46,067
Now he's panic-stricken.

1305
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:49,036
He's on the verge
of a mental collapse.

1306
01:36:49,243 --> 01:36:53,703
An inch away from confessing
the whole thing to the police.

1307
01:36:54,748 --> 01:36:57,808
And then one morning...

1308
01:36:58,018 --> 01:36:59,849
...he awakens...

1309
01:37:00,454 --> 01:37:04,185
...and the sun is shining,
and his family is around him.

1310
01:37:04,391 --> 01:37:08,555
Mysteriously, the crisis is lifted.

1311
01:37:10,197 --> 01:37:14,497
He takes his family to Europe
and as the months pass...

1312
01:37:14,701 --> 01:37:16,669
...he finds he's not punished.

1313
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:19,061
ln fact, he prospers.

1314
01:37:19,673 --> 01:37:22,369
The killing's attributed
to a drifter...

1315
01:37:22,576 --> 01:37:25,067
...who has many murders to his credit.

1316
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:28,043
What the hell,
one more doesn't matter.

1317
01:37:28,715 --> 01:37:30,808
Now he's scot-free.

1318
01:37:31,351 --> 01:37:34,684
His life is completely
back to normal...

1319
01:37:35,222 --> 01:37:39,921
...back to his protected world
of wealth and privilege.

1320
01:37:40,294 --> 01:37:43,855
Yes, but can he ever really go back?

1321
01:37:45,732 --> 01:37:49,668
Well, people carry sins
around with them, l mean....

1322
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:54,603
Oh, maybe once in a while
he has a bad moment, but it passes.

1323
01:37:55,008 --> 01:37:57,875
And with time, it all fades.

1324
01:37:58,345 --> 01:38:00,677
Yeah, but-- So then, you know--

1325
01:38:00,881 --> 01:38:04,612
Then his worst beliefs are realized.

1326
01:38:04,818 --> 01:38:07,787
l said it was
a chilling story, didn't l?

1327
01:38:09,856 --> 01:38:13,485
l think it'd be tough for
somebody to live with that.

1328
01:38:13,694 --> 01:38:17,926
Very few guys could actually live
with something like that.

1329
01:38:18,131 --> 01:38:22,067
People carry awful deeds with them.
What should he do?

1330
01:38:22,269 --> 01:38:23,827
Turn himself in?

1331
01:38:24,404 --> 01:38:26,235
l mean, this is reality.

1332
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,533
ln reality, we rationalize.

1333
01:38:28,742 --> 01:38:32,109
We deny, or we couldn't go on living.

1334
01:38:35,515 --> 01:38:38,609
l would have him turn himself in...

1335
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:42,414
...because then your story
assumes tragic proportions.

1336
01:38:42,622 --> 01:38:44,920
Because in the absence of a God...

1337
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:48,288
...he is forced to assume
that responsibility.

1338
01:38:48,495 --> 01:38:50,827
Then you have tragedy.

1339
01:38:51,164 --> 01:38:54,190
But that's fiction,
that's movies. l mean--

1340
01:38:54,401 --> 01:38:58,497
You see too many movies.
l'm talking about reality.

1341
01:38:58,705 --> 01:39:02,732
lf you want a happy ending,
go see a Hollywood movie.

1342
01:39:04,344 --> 01:39:08,371
Come on, darling.
Let's think about going home, huh?

1343
01:39:08,582 --> 01:39:10,777
Nice talking to you. Good luck.

1344
01:39:10,984 --> 01:39:15,318
We'll have a wedding like this
for Sharon, and l can't wait.

1345
01:39:15,522 --> 01:39:17,752
She'll be radiant.

1346
01:39:18,091 --> 01:39:22,687
-You're looking very handsome tonight.
-And you look beautiful.

1347
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:49,384
We are all faced
throughout our lives,,,

1348
01:39:49,589 --> 01:39:52,023
,,,with agonizing decisions,,,

1349
01:39:52,225 --> 01:39:54,216
,,,moral choices,

1350
01:39:54,428 --> 01:39:57,329
Some are on a grand scale,

1351
01:39:57,531 --> 01:40:01,763
Most of these choices
are on lesser points,

1352
01:40:02,803 --> 01:40:07,866
But we define ourselves
by the choices we have made,

1353
01:40:08,075 --> 01:40:13,035
We are, in fact,
the sum total of our choices,

1354
01:40:13,346 --> 01:40:16,645
Events unfold so unpredictably,,,

1355
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:19,245
,,,so unfairly,,,

1356
01:40:19,453 --> 01:40:23,583
,,,human happiness does not seem
to have been included,,,

1357
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:26,190
,,,in the design of Creation,

1358
01:40:26,393 --> 01:40:30,887
It is only we,
with our capacity to love,,,

1359
01:40:31,098 --> 01:40:34,898
,,, that give meaning
to the indifferent universe,

1360
01:40:35,302 --> 01:40:38,499
And yet, most human beings,,,

1361
01:40:38,705 --> 01:40:42,607
,,,seem to have the ability
to keep trying,,,

1362
01:40:42,809 --> 01:40:47,075
,,,and even to find joy
from simple things,,,

1363
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,010
,,,like their family,,,

1364
01:40:50,217 --> 01:40:51,912
,,, their work,,,

1365
01:40:52,119 --> 01:40:53,711
,,,and from the hope,,,

1366
