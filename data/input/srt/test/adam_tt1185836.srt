I need time to take things slowly.

What did he do?

631
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:02,028
While we were together,
he slept with other women.

632
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,272
Not <i>together</i> together,
but while we were in the relationship.

Oh.

- Right.

- Kissing.
- Yes.

- Holding.
- Yes.

638

And no sex.

639
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:35,255

Buying a telescope is a complicated decision.

674
00:49:37,354 --> 00:49:40,482
- You should focus on your interests.
- <i>No pun intended.</i>

- What?
- Focus?

676
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:47,857
Right. A-Are you interested
in the solar system– moon, planets, et cetera?

677
00:49:47,932 --> 00:49:50,867
<i>Or deeper space-nebulae, star clusters, galaxies.</i>

678
00:49:50,935 --> 00:49:54,200
Then you want a much larger lens
with a Dobsonian mount.

679
00:49:54,271 --> 00:49:57,365
- Uh, the eight-bar refractors
go up to 180 millimeters.
- Hi, Adam.

680
00:49:57,441 --> 00:50:00,877
Hi. Michael's looking for a telescope
to buy for her cottage in Kerhonkson.

681
00:50:00,945 --> 00:50:03,140
For deep space in a static position...

682
00:50:03,214 --> 00:50:06,706
you could really think about
some bigger reflectors–

683
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:11,416
Have– Have you heard too much about telescopes?

684

No. No.

It's an award for children's books.

No, I know what a Newberry Award is.

Are you still gonna make them talk?

Mm-hmm. They're gonna be
a typical New York family...

00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:35,032
except they live in the park,
and they're raccoons.

Okay. Your turn.

Instead of making stuff up...

714
00:51:58,362 --> 00:52:00,990
why couldn't you write about the real raccoons?

715
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:05,561
Because it's a children's book,
not a nature book.

716
00:52:05,636 --> 00:52:08,366
Well, I'd probably like the nature book better.

Living Theatre was based here.

with a spear from her production of <i>Ubu Roi.</i>

had its American premiere here in 1957...

- <i>He's a lawyer. He's paid to worry.</i>

Bottom line, if the feds push this

That's what I'm accused of.

- But she's qualified, right?

00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:31,720
- I mean, she went to Wharton.
- Yes. She's qualified.

790
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:33,786
Uncle Eric's not really my uncle.

She's young. She made a few mistakes.

Uh, no.

804
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,433
Maybe that's not his fault. Monday
he goes on trial, in case you didn't get that.

- The important thing?

807

All of a sudden you know what's important?

00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:34,947
- Oh, okay.
- Just forget it!

Of course not. I didn't me–

Well, no, it's just an interview.

There's a saying in my family:
It's never too early to drink the champagne.

You'd be good at this job, right?

So all you gotta do is let 'em know it.

That's all? That's impossible.

01:29:56,972 --> 01:29:59,202
so that the light from two or more telescopes...

1241
01:29:59,274 --> 01:30:03,870
can produce, um, uh, a brighter image
than one alone.
