1
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:50,682
Spain, 1944

2
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:59,649
{\an8}\N\N\NThe Civil War is over.

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,649
{\an5}Hidden in the mountains, armed men
are still fighting the new Fascist regime.\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,649
Military posts are established
to exterminate the Resistance.

5
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,436
A long time ago, a very long time.

6
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,873
in the Underground Realm,

7
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,823
where there are no lies or pain,

8
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,890
there lived a princess who
dreamt of the human world.

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,480
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

10
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,728
One day,

11
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,107
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

12
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,598
Once outside,
the bright sun blinded her

13
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,587
and erased her memory.

14
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,817
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

15
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,799
Her body suffered cold,
sickness and pain.

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,707
And eventually she died.

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,399
However, her father, the king,

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,399
always knew that the
Princess' soul would return,

19
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,999
perhaps in another body,

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,999
in another place, at another time.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,899
And he would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

22
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,255
until the world stopped turning...

23
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,749
I don't understand why you had
to bring so many books, Ofelia.

24
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,824
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

25
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,999
Fairy tales...

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,422
You're a bit too old to be filling
your head with such nonsense.

27
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,099
Ask him to stop the car, please.

28
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,285
Ofelia, wait.
Your brother is acting up.

29
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,089
Madam, are you okay?

30
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,761
Water. Water for the Captain's wife.
Hurry. Hurry.

31
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,978
Ofelia?

32
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,554
Ofelia, come here.

33
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,927
- I saw a fairy.
- Just look at your shoes!

34
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,255
Let's go.

35
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,149
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

36
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,399
I want you to call him Father.

37
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,397
You have no idea how
good he's been to us.

38
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,027
It's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

39
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,199
Captain, here they come.

40
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,673
15 minutes late.

41
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,842
Carmen.

42
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,539
Welcome.

43
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,399
That's not necessary.
I can walk perfectly well.

44
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,578
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

45
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,680
No.

46
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,626
Come. Do it for me.

47
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,899
Thank you.

48
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,599
Ofelia, come out.

49
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,622
Say hello to the Captain.

50
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,199
Ofelia.

51
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,367
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

52
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,266
Mercedes!

53
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,984
- Bring their luggage.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,564
It's a labyrinth.

55
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,904
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

56
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,118
Even before the mill.

57
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,664
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

58
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,994
Thank you.

59
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,099
Have you read them all?

60
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,340
Mercedes!

61
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,618
The Captain is calling.

62
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,303
Your father needs me.

63
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,276
He's not my father.

64
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,549
The Captain is not my father.

65
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,999
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

66
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,899
The Captain is not my father.

67
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,120
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

68
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,999
Have you seen my mother?

69
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,199
- Isn't she beautiful!
- Yes.

70
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,111
She's sick with baby. Did you notice?

71
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,499
The guerrillas are sticking to the woods

72
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,591
because it's hard to
track them up there.

73
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,949
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

74
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,247
We'll block all access
to the woods.

75
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,299
Food, medicine...
we'll store it all. Right here.

76
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,499
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

77
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,349
We'll set up three
new command posts.

78
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,199
Here, here and here.

79
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,467
Mercedes.

80
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,349
Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.

81
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,782
Yes, sir.

82
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,405
This will help you sleep
through the night.

83
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,900
Just two drops just before bed.

84
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,121
Two drops only.

85
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,850
Very good.

86
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,482
All of it. Good.

87
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,300
Don't hesitate to call me if you
need anything. Day or night.

88
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,055
You or your nurse.

89
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,923
Good night.

90
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,402
Close the door and turn
off the lights, sweetie.

91
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,799
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

92
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,170
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

93
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,199
This is all I could get.

94
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,359
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,972
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

96
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,376
Come here, Ofelia.

97
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,294
Jesus, your feet. They're frozen.

98
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,295
Are you afraid?

99
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,897
A little.

100
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,699
What's that noise?

101
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,723
Nothing... just the wind.

102
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,861
Nights here are different
from city nights.

103
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,642
There, you hear cars, the tramway.
Here the houses are old.

104
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,129
They creak.

105
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,808
As if they were speaking.

106
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,392
Tomorrow I'm going
to give you a surprise.

107
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,858
A surprise?

108
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,847
- A book?
- No, something much better.

109
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,396
Why did you have to get married?

110
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,299
I was alone too long.

111
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,423
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

112
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,293
You were never alone.

113
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,207
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.

114
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,699
Your brother's at it again...

115
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,349
Tell him one of your stories.

116
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,548
I'm sure he'll calm down.

117
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,341
My brother, my brother...

118
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,549
Many, many years ago,

119
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,999
in a sad, faraway land,

120
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,572
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

121
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,017
At sunset,

122
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,840
on top of that mountain,

123
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,949
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

124
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,899
But no one dared go near it...

125
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,158
because its thorns were full of poison.

126
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,999
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

127
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,833
and pain, but never about
the promise of eternal life.

128
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:15,228
And every day, the rose wilted,
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone...

129
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,649
forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

130
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,255
forever alone, until the end of time.

131
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,669
Come in.

132
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,682
- How is she?
- Very weak.

133
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,049
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

134
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,445
I'll sleep down here.

135
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,099
- And my son?
- Pardon?

136
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,419
Excuse us, Captain...

137
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,890
My son, how is he?

138
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,911
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

139
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,038
Very good.

140
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,949
Captain,

141
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,027
your wife should not have traveled
at such a late stage of pregnancy.

142
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,593
- Is that your opinion?
- My professional opinion, yes, sir.

143
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,390
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

144
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,892
That's all.

145
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,196
One more thing, Captain.

146
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,141
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

147
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,753
Don't fuck with me.

148
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,773
At 8 o'clock, we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

149
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,305
Gunfire.

150
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,473
Sergeant Bayona searched the
area and captured a suspect.

151
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,099
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

152
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,699
Captain, my father is an honest man.

153
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,199
Let me judge that.

154
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,681
Take your hat off in front of me.

155
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,549
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

156
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,664
- My father was hunting rabbits, Captain.
- Again - keep quiet.

157
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,299
"No God, no country, no Master"?

158
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,899
- Just like that, how do you like that?
- Red propaganda, Captain.

159
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,488
It's not propaganda, sir.

160
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,560
It's an old almanac, Captain.

161
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,438
We're just farmers.

162
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,297
Go on.

163
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,978
I went up into the woods, Captain?
To hunt for rabbits.

164
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,298
For my daughters. They're sick.

165
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,199
Rabbits, uh?

166
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,730
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

167
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,835
Leave him alone!

168
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,699
You killed him, you killed him!

169
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,753
Murderer! Son of a bitch!

170
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,899
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

171
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,799
before you come bothering me.

172
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,894
Yes, Captain.

173
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,099
Mother. Mother, wake up!

174
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,983
Mother, there's something in the room.

175
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,799
Hello.

176
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,899
Did you follow me here?

177
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,598
Are you a fairy?

178
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,600
Look!

179
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,939
This is a fairy.

180
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,077
You want me to go with you?

181
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,206
Outside? Where?

182
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,847
Hello?

183
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,692
Echo.

184
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,856
Hello?

185
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,995
It's you.

186
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,299
It's you. You've returned.

187
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,597
Don't be frightened, I beg you.

188
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,287
Look... look...

189
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,699
My name is Ofelia. Who are you?

190
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,733
Me?

191
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,049
I've had so many names...

192
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,849
Old names that only the wind

193
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,299
and the trees can pronounce.

194
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:35,436
I am the mountain,
the woods and the earth.

195
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,871
I am...

196
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,492
I am a faun.

197
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,449
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

198
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,199
- No, I'm-
- You're Princess Moanna,

199
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,849
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

200
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,699
My father was a tailor.

201
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,799
You are not born of man.

202
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,499
It was the moon that bore you.

203
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,999
Look on your left shoulder

204
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,399
and you will find a
mark that proves it.

205
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:18,299
Your real father had us open
portals all over the world

206
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,440
to allow your return.

207
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,411
This is the last of them.

208
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,599
But we have to make sure

209
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,449
that your essence is intact,

210
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,884
that you have not
become a mortal.

211
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,390
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

212
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:59,499
This is The Book of Crossroads.

213
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,799
Open it, when you are alone

214
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,799
and it will show you your future,

215
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,695
show you what must be done.

216
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,882
But there's nothing in here.

217
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,299
Mercedes, prepare these
rabbits for dinner tonight.

218
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,099
They are too young.

219
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,541
- Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,105
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

221
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,394
You should keep an eye on it.

222
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,357
As you wish, sir.

223
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,180
Cook these.

224
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,649
He didn't like the coffee.

225
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,899
He's nothing but a fussy dandy.
A fussy dandy.

226
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,149
We're going to need some
beef and one more chicken.

227
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,149
- Where are we supposed to find that?
- The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

228
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,191
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

229
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,921
- And they won't shut up.
- Not even underwater.

230
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,998
I'll be back in a moment, Mercedes.

231
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,061
Ofelia.

232
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,249
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

233
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,644
Look what I've made for you.

234
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,947
Do you like it?

235
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,299
What I wouldn't have given to have a dress
as fine as this when I was your age!

236
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,300
And look at the shoes!

237
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
They're leather.

238
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,599
Do you like them?

239
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,352
Yes, they're very pretty.

240
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,972
Go on, now. Take your bath.

241
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,237
Ofelia?

242
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,499
Ofelia? Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.

243
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,780
I want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

244
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,735
You'll look like a princess.

245
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,550
A princess...

246
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,799
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

247
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,393
And don't forget the beans.

248
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,399
You look marvelous, my girl...,

249
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,181
- just beautiful.
- What a gorgeous dress!

250
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,589
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

251
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,952
Do you want some
milk with honey?

252
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,899
Move back, we can't have you
getting milk on your dress,

253
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,170
with you looking so pretty.

254
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,767
Mercedes. Do you believe in fairies?

255
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,049
No. But when I was a little girl, I did.

256
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,374
I believed in a lot of things
I don't believe anymore.

257
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,180
Last night, a fairy visited me.

258
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,989
Really?

259
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,199
And it wasn't alone, there were
lots of them, and a faun, too.

260
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,199
A faun?

261
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,580
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

262
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,499
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

263
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,772
Mercedes!

264
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,599
Come with me.

265
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,249
Captain, everything is here.

266
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,699
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

267
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,359
olives, bacon...

268
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,199
This - this is real tobacco.

269
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,294
And the ration cards.

270
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,110
- I need you to check the inventory.
- Very well.

271
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,814
Mercedes.

272
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,242
- The key.
- Yes, sir.

273
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,099
- Is this the only copy?
- The only one.

274
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,295
From now on, I'll carry it.

275
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,955
Captain.

276
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,528
Captain, perhaps it's nothing.

277
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,713
It's them.

278
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,899
"Once upon a time,
when the woods were young,

279
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,599
they were home to creatures

280
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,910
who were full of magic and wonder."

281
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,949
"They protected one another,

282
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,499
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

283
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,559
that grew on a hill, near the mill."

284
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,699
"But now, the tree is dying.

285
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,149
Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

286
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,599
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

287
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,899
and won't let the tree thrive.

288
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,299
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth...

289
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,399
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

290
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,485
Only then will the fig
tree flourish again."

291
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,699
They were here less than
twenty minutes ago.

292
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,118
They left in a hurry.

293
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,027
A dozen men, at most.

294
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,331
Antibiotics.

295
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,768
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

296
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,847
They're here.

297
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,776
Those sons of bitches are here...

298
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,987
and they're watching us.

299
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,466
Hey!

300
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,844
You left this behind!

301
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,499
And your lottery ticket!

302
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,349
Why don't you come back and get it?

303
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,346
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

304
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,899
H- hello. I'm Princess Moanna,

305
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,373
and I'm not afraid of you.

306
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,299
Aren't you ashamed living down here,

307
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,292
eating all these bugs...

308
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,326
and growing fat while the tree dies?

309
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,649
Hey!

310
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,099
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

311
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,526
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,899
Have you checked the garden?

313
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,124
- And the barn?
- Yes, ma'am.

314
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,199
Where is that girl?

315
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,787
This way, please.

316
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,999
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

317
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,799
- Charmed.
- A pleasure to meet you.

318
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,849
From now on,
one ration card per family.

319
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,949
Take a look at them.

320
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,877
- One?
- Only one.

321
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,199
- Captain, I'm not sure it'll be enough.
- If people are careful, it should be plenty.

322
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,599
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerrillas in the mountains.

323
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,572
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

324
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,049
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

325
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,721
We almost got them today.
We found this.

326
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,023
Antibiotics.

327
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,699
God has already saved their souls.

328
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,549
What happens to their bodies
hardly matters to Him.

329
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,099
We'll help you in any
way we can, Captain.

330
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,200
We know you're not here by choice.

331
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,289
You're wrong about that.

332
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,799
I choose to be here
because I want my son

333
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,752
to be born in a new, clean Spain.

334
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,199
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief...

335
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,933
that we're all equal.

336
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,399
But there's a big difference:

337
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,871
the war is over and we won.

338
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,399
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

339
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,595
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

340
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,523
We're all here by choice.

341
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,171
By choice!

342
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,499
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

343
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,100
We'll take care of it.

344
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,737
Ofelia?

345
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,643
So... How did you and the Captain meet?

346
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,899
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

347
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,349
Oh, I see...

348
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:23,749
And after he died,
I went to work at the shop.

349
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,890
A little more than a year ago,

350
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,499
the Captain and I met again.

351
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,599
Curious, isn't it!

352
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,575
I mean, finding each other again?

353
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,999
Oh, yes, very, very curious.

354
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,149
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

355
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,036
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

356
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,706
We understand, Captain.

357
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,002
Ofelia is here...

358
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,996
Excuse me.

359
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,450
Have I told you that I was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

360
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,828
No. I had no idea.

361
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,681
In Morocco.

362
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,199
I knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

363
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,470
An excellent soldier.

364
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,499
The men in his battalion said...

365
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,991
that when General Vidal
died on the battlefield,

366
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,899
he smashed his watch on a rock...

367
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,613
so that his son would know the exact
hour and minute of his death.

368
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,841
So he would know how a brave man dies.

369
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,772
Nonsense. He didn't own a watch.

370
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:44,744
What you've done hurts me.

371
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,965
When you've finished your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

372
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,818
Are you listening?

373
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,874
Sometimes I think you'll
never learn to behave.

374
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,443
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

375
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,490
And your father, too.

376
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,241
You mean the Captain?

377
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,786
Him more than me.

378
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,499
I've got the key.

379
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,933
Take me to the Labyrinth.

380
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,871
Hello.

381
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,367
I got the key out.

382
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:35,441
That's me, and the girl is you.

383
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:36,956
And the baby?

384
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,935
So, you retrieved the key.

385
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,730
I'm glad.

386
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,093
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

387
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,571
She's so glad you succeeded.

388
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,349
Keep the key.

389
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,649
You'll be needing it very soon.

390
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:16,412
And this too? A piece of chalk.

391
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,349
Two tasks remain...

392
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:26,249
and the moon is almost full.

393
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,047
Be patient.

394
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:37,149
We'll soon stroll through the seven
circular gardens of your palace.

395
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,843
How do I know that
what you say is true?

396
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:45,533
Why would a poor little
faun like me lie to you?

397
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,090
Proceed.

398
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,899
Have your cards ready for inspection.

399
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,521
Let's go. Your name?

400
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,951
Your full names.

401
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,323
Narciso Peña Soriano,
at your service.

402
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,499
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

403
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,949
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

404
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,699
because in a united Spain,

405
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,547
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

406
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,115
Come on, show me
what happens now?

407
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,050
Show me.

408
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,384
Ofelia... help me.

409
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,199
This is our daily bread in Franco's
Spain, kept safe in this mill.

410
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,881
Captain! Captain!

411
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,599
The Reds lie when they say
there's hunger in Spain...

412
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,199
- Come quickly.
- ... because in a united Spain,

413
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,074
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

414
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,543
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

415
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,283
Your wife needs uninterrupted rest.

416
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,137
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

417
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,292
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

418
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,012
I'll stay here until the birth.

419
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,492
Make her well.

420
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,459
I don't care what it costs
or what you need.

421
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,497
Make her well.

422
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,945
Don't worry.

423
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,599
Your mother will get
better soon, you'll see.

424
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,888
Having a baby is complicated.

425
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,374
Then I'll never have one.

426
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,490
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

427
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,144
Have you told anyone?

428
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,131
No, I haven't.

429
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,652
I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

430
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,147
Nor I to you.

431
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,575
Do you know a lullaby?

432
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,945
Only one...

433
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,032
but I don't remember the words.

434
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,652
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

435
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,201
Don't be afraid. It's only me.

436
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,261
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

437
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,603
Then let's go.

438
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,099
This is sheer madness.

439
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,099
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

440
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,699
- Have you thought about that?
- Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

441
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,687
It's not fear...

442
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,506
at least not for myself.

443
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:49,738
Pedro, Pedro, my brother.

444
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:12,079
- You didn't carry out the task.
- No, my mother is sick.

445
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,898
That's no excuse for negligence.

446
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:21,149
Look... this is a mandrake root.

447
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:24,724
A plant that dreamt of being human.

448
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,899
Put it under your mother's bed...

449
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,390
in a bowl of fresh milk.

450
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,897
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

451
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,144
Now, we have no time to waste.

452
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,613
The full moon will be upon us.

453
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,734
Take my pets to guide you through.

454
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,572
You're going to a very dangerous place,

455
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,649
so be careful.

456
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:01,218
The thing that slumbers there,

457
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,430
it is not human.

458
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,199
You will see a sumptuous feast,

459
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,599
but don't eat or drink anything.

460
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,779
Absolutely nothing.

461
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,004
Your life depends on it.

462
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:52,299
I've brought some
Orujo, tobacco, cheese.

463
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,019
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

464
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,199
Let's see how that leg is doing,
Frenchie.

465
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,671
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

466
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,740
Let's see.

467
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,030
...N-North American,

468
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:15,099
British and C-C-Canadian troops...

469
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,837
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F...

470
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,899
- France, stuttering idiot.
- France.

471
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,599
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

472
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,266
under the command of General
Dwight D. Eisenhower...

473
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,951
Is it really bad, doctor?

474
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,354
Look, Frenchie...

475
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,257
There's no way to save it.

476
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,931
I'll try to make it in
as few cuts as possible.

477
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,492
Wait a second, doctor, just a second.

478
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,907
"Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."

479
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,668
"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."

480
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,499
"Let the fairies guide you."

481
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,099
"Don't eat or drink anything
during your stay,

482
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:14,110
and come back before the
last grain of sand falls."

483
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,773
No...

484
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,536
This other one.

485
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,227
No! No!

486
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,299
We'll soon have
reinforcements from Jaca.

487
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,899
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

488
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,499
And then what?

489
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,199
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

490
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,199
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

491
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,599
You need food, medicine.
You should take care of Mercedes.

492
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,849
If you really loved her, you'd cross the
border with her. This is a lost cause.

493
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,287
I'm staying here, doctor.
There's no choice.

494
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,010
You have to leave.

495
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,649
Here's the key, but you can't
go down there now.

496
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,318
It's exactly what he expects.

497
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,098
Leave it to me.

498
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:20,299
I'm a coward.

499
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,191
No, you're not.

500
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,366
Yes, I am.

501
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,595
A coward...

502
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,599
for living next to
that son of a bitch,

503
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,492
doing his laundry, making
his bed, feeding him...

504
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,373
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

505
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,490
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

506
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,989
Left march! Left march!

507
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,414
Captain Vidal.

508
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,501
Her temperature is down.
I don't know how, but it is.

509
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,049
But she still has a fever?

510
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:53,394
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

511
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,449
Listen to me.

512
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:59,599
If you have to choose,
save the baby.

513
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,299
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

514
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,399
Save him.

515
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,791
Brother...

516
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,477
little brother...

517
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,049
if you can hear me,

518
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:51,689
things out here aren't too good.

519
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,693
But soon you'll have to come out.

520
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,004
You've made Mama very sick.

521
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,493
I want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

522
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,129
just one:

523
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:09,249
don't hurt her.

524
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:12,748
You'll meet her, she's very pretty,

525
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,699
even though sometimes she's
sad for many days at a time.

526
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,299
You'll see, when she smiles,

527
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,942
you'll love her.

528
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,649
Listen, if you do what I say,

529
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:30,149
I'll make you a promise,

530
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:34,799
I'll take you to my kingdom,
and I'll make you a prince.

531
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,953
I promise you, a prince.

532
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,349
I sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

533
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,799
I tried to stop, but it was too late.

534
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,499
The fireman and I
jumped out just in time,

535
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,422
but look at the mess they made.

536
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,299
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

537
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,349
They didn't open a single one.

538
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:22,949
What the hell are you talking about?

539
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:25,399
This whole mess,
they didn't open any of the cars.

540
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,437
- They didn't take anything.
- Nothing? Are you sure?

541
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,099
God only knows what they wanted,

542
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,401
other than to waste our time.

543
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,653
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

544
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,717
They have grenades, they went up hill.

545
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:06,849
Captain, we've surrounded a small unit.

546
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:09,143
They took cover up on the hill.

547
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:47,899
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

548
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,703
Let me see.

549
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,197
Can you talk?

550
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,684
Damn it...

551
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:26,389
These are useless...
they can't talk.

552
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:37,692
Captain, this one's still alive.

553
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,314
Shot in the leg.

554
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,099
- What's happened?
- They caught one.

555
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,499
What?

556
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,956
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

557
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,138
Mercedes!

558
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:02,733
Pedro... Pedro...

559
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,799
Captain, I need to get
into the storeroom.

560
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,641
- Not now, Mercedes.
- Move away.

561
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,999
That's plenty, dear.

562
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,408
Should I take this up?

563
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,955
Here, half the dose.

564
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,799
I don't think I need it.

565
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,578
I feel better, much better.

566
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,997
I don't understand it. But I'm glad.

567
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,699
Mother...

568
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,027
Damn, this cigarette is good!

569
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,281
Real tobacco... hard to find.

570
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,403
G-G-Go to hell.

571
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:07,642
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

572
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,349
We'll be here all night.

573
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,763
As long as he talks...

574
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,701
Garces is right.

575
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:23,599
You'd do better to tell us everything.

576
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:27,678
But to make sure it happens,
I brought along a few tools.

577
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,999
Just things you pick
up along the way.

578
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,660
At first I won't be able to trust you,

579
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,631
but after I use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

580
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,949
When we get to these,

581
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:46,999
we'll have developed a...
how can I put this?

582
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,984
A closer bond, much like brothers.

583
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,459
You'll see.

584
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,657
And when we get to this one,

585
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,261
I'll believe anything you tell me.

586
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,799
I'll make you a deal.

587
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,599
If you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,

588
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,605
you can go.

589
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:23,599
Don't look at him, look at me.

590
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,599
Above me, there's no one...

591
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,194
- Garces!
- Yes, Captain?

592
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,299
If I say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

593
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,699
No one, Captain. He can leave.

594
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:38,808
There you have it. Count to three.

595
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,517
One...

596
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,295
Good.

597
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,191
Two...

598
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:08,192
Good. One more and you're free.

599
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,898
Shame.

600
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,629
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

601
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:48,778
Surely, you must be relieved.

602
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,747
Yes, thank you.

603
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,810
But things haven't turned out so well.

604
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,499
No?

605
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,750
- I had an accident.
- An accident?

606
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,051
Yes.

607
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,999
You broke the rules!

608
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,798
It was only two grapes.
I thought no one would notice.

609
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,549
We've made a mistake!

610
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:22,720
A mistake?

611
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:26,999
You failed! You can never return!

612
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,799
- It was an accident!
- You cannot return!

613
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,665
The moon will be full in three days.

614
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:41,199
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

615
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,199
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them

616
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:49,297
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

617
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:54,018
And we'll vanish along with it.

618
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,280
You will never see us again.

619
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,803
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,

620
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,406
but I think we need your help.

621
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,199
My God, what have you done to him?

622
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,457
Not much.

623
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,219
But things are getting better.

624
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,979
I like having you handy, Doctor.

625
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,509
It has its advantages.

626
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,799
Serrano, stay here.

627
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,299
I talked.

628
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,013
Not much...

629
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,896
b-b-but I talked.

630
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,538
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

631
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:24,817
Kill me, kill me now. Please.

632
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,543
Son of a bitch.

633
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,666
It'll take away the pain.

634
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,757
It's almost over.

635
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,399
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,
I'll be right there.

636
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,399
Yes, Captain.

637
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,861
You're not moving anymore.

638
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,139
Are you sick?

639
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,311
What are you doing down there?

640
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,399
- Call him!
- Who?

641
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,096
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

642
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,863
What the hell is this?

643
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,949
No! No, no, no, no!

644
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:51,197
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

645
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,249
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

646
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,753
What do you think of this?

647
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:06,437
Ofelia, what is this thing
doing under the bed?

648
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:10,849
It's a magic root the faun gave me.

649
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:13,499
This is all because of that
junk you let her read.

650
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:14,899
Look what you've done!

651
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:18,596
Please, leave us alone.
I'll talk to her, darling.

652
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,603
Fine. As you wish.

653
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,399
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

654
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,861
Ofelia, you have to
listen to your father.

655
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,299
You have to stop all this.

656
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:36,299
No. I want to leave this place!

657
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,699
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, please!

658
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,456
Things are not that simple.

659
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,377
You're getting older,

660
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,049
soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

661
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:53,999
The world is a cruel place.

662
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:58,889
And you'll learn that, even if it hurts.

663
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,224
- No! No!
- Ofelia!

664
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:09,049
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

665
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,638
Mom! Help!

666
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:24,365
Help!

667
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,512
Why did you do it?

668
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,545
It was the only thing I could do.

669
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:42,216
No. You could have obeyed me.

670
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,986
I could have, but I didn't.

671
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:50,295
It would have been better for you.
You know it.

672
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,361
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

673
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:58,799
To obey, just like that,
for the sake of obeying,

674
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,168
without questioning...

675
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,948
that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

676
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,319
Captain!

677
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:53,199
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

678
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,681
- Get up immediately!
- Yes, Captain.

679
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,472
Your wife is dead.

680
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:45,789
"Because the paths to the
Lord are inscrutable...

681
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,949
Because the essence
of His forgiveness...

682
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:50,649
Lies in His word and in His mystery...

683
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:55,149
Because although God
sends us the message...

684
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,599
It is our task to decipher it...

685
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,649
Because when we open our arms...

686
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:05,949
The earth takes in only a
hollow and senseless shell...

687
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,799
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory...

688
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:14,899
Because it is in pain that
we find the meaning of life...

689
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,399
And the state of grace that
we lose when we are born...

690
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:24,799
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands...

691
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,199
And because it is only
in His physical absence,

692
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:35,799
that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed."

693
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,899
You knew Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,

694
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:01,949
didn't you, Mercedes?

695
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:05,135
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

696
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:10,574
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

697
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,295
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

698
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,725
Mercedes, please.

699
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,704
What must you think of me?

700
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,449
You must think that I'm a monster.

701
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:38,560
It doesn't matter what
someone like me thinks, sir.

702
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,599
I want you to go to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

703
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,749
Yes, sir. Goodnight, sir.

704
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,006
Mercedes, aren't you
forgetting something?

705
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,433
Sir?

706
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,476
The key.

707
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,059
I do have the only copy, don't I?

708
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,451
Yes, sir.

709
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,249
You know, there's an odd detail

710
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,949
that's been bothering me.
Maybe it's not important, but...

711
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:22,799
the day they broke into the storehouse,

712
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,999
with all those grenades and explosives,

713
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,402
the lock itself wasn't forced.

714
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,973
As I said, it's probably not important.

715
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,862
Be very careful.

716
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,549
Good night, Sir.

717
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,490
Ofelia! Ofelia!

718
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,149
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.

719
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:33,699
- Where to?
- I can't tell you. I can't tell you.

720
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,949
- Take me with you.
- No, no. I can't.

721
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:40,099
I can't, my child. But I'll come
back for you, I promise.

722
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,908
Take me with you.

723
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:07,742
I heard something.

724
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:15,392
It's nothing, don't worry.

725
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,348
Mercedes.

726
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,581
Ofelia.

727
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,866
How long have you known about her?

728
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,394
How long have you been
laughing at me? Little bitch!

729
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,497
Watch her!

730
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:56,244
And if anyone tries to get in,

731
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,284
kill her first.

732
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,494
Dry meat.

733
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,614
Tobacco.

734
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,142
If you had asked for it, I would
have given it to you, Mercedes.

735
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,102
I want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

736
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,149
And I want them in
front of me, tomorrow.

737
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:37,547
Yes, Captain.

738
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,453
You can go, Garces.

739
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,265
You're sure, Captain?

740
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:50,061
For God's sake, she's just a woman.

741
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:56,159
That's what you've always thought.

742
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:59,362
That's why I was able
to get away with it.

743
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:04,058
- I was invisible to you.
- Damn.

744
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,192
You've found my weakness: Pride.

745
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:13,727
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

746
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:19,470
It's very simple: you will talk...

747
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,127
and I have to know...

748
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:26,599
that everything you say is the truth.

749
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:30,935
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

750
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,347
Nothing complicated.

751
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:38,851
Things we learn on the job.

752
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,699
At first, I'm not going
to be able to trust you.

753
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,949
I'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

754
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:06,997
Motherfucker...
Don't you dare touch the girl?

755
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:08,992
You won't be the first pig I've gutted!

756
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,599
The winning lottery numbers are:

757
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,228
3-3-0-3-7.

758
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,641
He let her go.

759
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,370
The fuck did you say?

760
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,063
Get her! Come on! Bring her to me!

761
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,499
Bring her to me, damn it!

762
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,058
Mount up!

763
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:57,999
It'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

764
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,943
The Captain said that if you behave-

765
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,266
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

766
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:09,295
if anyone's going to kill you...

767
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:12,313
I'd rather it be me.

768
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,060
I've decided to give you...

769
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:28,222
one last chance.

770
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:34,579
Do you promise to do what I say?

771
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:38,483
Will you do everything I tell you,

772
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,866
without question?

773
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:45,815
This is your last chance.

774
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,799
Then listen to me.

775
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,093
Fetch your brother...

776
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:55,399
and bring him to the labyrinth,

777
01:36:55,400 --> 01:37:00,049
as quickly as you can, Your Highness.

778
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:01,322
My brother?

779
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:02,840
We need him.

780
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,297
- But-
- No more questions.

781
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:11,394
The door's locked.

782
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,049
In that case...

783
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:17,814
create your own door.

784
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,516
Captain, with your permission.

785
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,749
Come quickly.

786
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:16,133
- Now what?
- Serrano is back. He's wounded.

787
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:17,999
Wounded?

788
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:06,064
Where's Garces?

789
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:15,099
How many were there?

790
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:17,699
I don't know exactly, Captain.

791
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:19,299
Fifty men, at least.

792
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:23,049
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

793
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,899
How many men do we have left?

794
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:27,162
Twenty, maybe less, sir.

795
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:41,093
We're leaving. Together.

796
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:43,999
Don't be afraid.

797
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,390
Nothing is going to happen to you.

798
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:53,849
Put them on picket
duty at the tree line.

799
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:56,199
If the rest of the squad gets back,

800
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,199
have it report immediately to me.

801
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,849
Radio for reinforcements, now.

802
01:41:59,850 --> 01:42:01,130
Yes, Captain.

803
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,708
Leave him!

804
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:16,530
Ofelia!

805
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,699
Quickly, Your Majesty,

806
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:49,407
give him to me.

807
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,999
The full moon is high in the sky,

808
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,929
we can open the portal.

809
01:44:56,750 --> 01:44:58,891
Why is that in your hand?

810
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:04,999
The portal will only open if we
offer the blood of an innocent.

811
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,599
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

812
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,046
It's the final task.

813
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:13,572
Hurry.

814
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,620
You promised to obey me!

815
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:22,281
- Give me the boy!
- No!

816
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,950
My brother stays with me.

817
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:31,299
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

818
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,665
Yes, I would.

819
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,999
You would give up your throne for him?

820
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,499
He who has caused you such misery,
such humiliation?

821
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:45,212
Yes, I would.

822
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:55,639
As you wish, Your Highness.

823
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,598
No.

824
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,499
My son.

825
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:41,403
Tell my son...

826
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:49,653
Tell him what time his father died.

827
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,905
- Tell him that I-
- No.

828
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:55,092
He won't even know your name.

829
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:39,304
Arise, my daughter.

830
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:43,776
Come.

831
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:11,199
Father.

832
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:15,357
You have spilled your own blood
rather than the blood of an innocent.

833
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:19,795
That was the final task,
and the most important.

834
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:36,149
And you chose well, Your Highness.

835
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:37,413
Come here with me,

836
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,782
and sit by your father's side.

837
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:43,636
He's been waiting for you so long.

838
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:40,092
And it is said that the Princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

839
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:44,699
That she reigned there with
justice and a kind heart...

840
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:46,699
for many centuries.

841
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:49,949
That she was loved by her people.

842
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,646
And that she left behind...

843
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:55,699
small traces of her time on earth.

844
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:58,199
visible only to those...

845
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,278
who know where to look.

846
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:08,478
"Pan's Labyrinth"
