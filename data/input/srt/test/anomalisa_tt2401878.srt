1
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,708
Hey, Ma, look. An airplane.

2
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,298
- What?
- Airplane.

3
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:39,614
Oh, yeah.

4
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:43,304
Who was TV's Kojak?

5
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,486
Darren McGavin.

6
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,056
Kojak, not Kolchak.

7
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,548
- How many letters?
- Seven.

8
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,984
Do you have any letters already?

9
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:00,120
Yeah. The third letter is a V, I think.

10
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,589
I'm not sure.

11
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,593
Blank-blank-blank-V-
blank-blank-blank. Right?

12
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,528
Yes, I think.

13
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,230
It's a bald guy, right?

14
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,666
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
as we start our descent,</i>

15
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:15,736
<i>please make sure your seat backs
and tray tables are in full upright position,</i>

16
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,970
<i>make sure your seat belt is fastened
securely and all carry-on luggage</i>

17
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,244
<i>is stowed beneath the seat in front
of you or in the overhead bins.</i>

18
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:27,247
<i>Please turn off all electronic devices
until we are safely parked at the gate.</i>

19
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,396
<i>Thank you.</i>

20
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,681
<i>November 12th, 1995.</i>

21
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,318
<i>Dear Michael. Fuck you. Just fuck you.</i>

22
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,292
<i>You just walk away?
After all you said to me?</i>

23
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,558
<i>After all we did?
After all those fucking promises?</i>

24
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,435
<i>After all that fucking fucking?</i>

25
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:34,315
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to be
the first to welcome you to Cincinnati,</i>

26
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:37,418
<i>where the local time is 7:43 p.m.,</i>

27
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:40,321
<i>and the temperature
is 68 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

28
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,643
<i>We will be taxiing for a while,
so please...</i>

29
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:47,175
<i>stay seated until the pilot turns off
the "fasten seat belt" light.</i>

30
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,947
- Sorry I grabbed your hand.
- It's okay.

31
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,854
It's a reflex.

32
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,686
I'm usually sitting next to my wife.

33
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:05,184
- I don't like to fly.
- I said it's okay.

34
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,357
You can let go now, though.

35
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,095
<i>Robert Hernandez, please pick up
the white courtesy phone.</i>

36
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,837
<i>Please, Robert Hernandez
to the white courtesy phone, please.</i>

37
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,310
<i>Welcome to Cincinnati/North
Kentucky International Airport.</i>

38
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:35,147
<i>While on the moving sidewalk,
please stand to the...</i>

39
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,187
- Hello.
- Hi.

40
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:06,746
I need to go to The Fregoli.

41
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,290
- Downtown.
- Yup.

42
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:16,484
<i>...your attention, please.
No parking or waiting allowed.</i>

43
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,752
<i>Unattended vehicles
in this area will be towed.</i>

44
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,560
- Thanks.
- Yup.

45
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,479
- Can I smoke in here?
- You see that sign?

46
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,226
- You're from England, right?
- Yeah, I'm from England.

47
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:06,633
I can tell by your accent.
And the whistling, that's British Airways.

48
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,742
It's <i>Lakme,</i> actually.

49
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,547
Nah, that's British Airways.

50
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,619
Anyway, I have an ear for accents.

51
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,526
How's the weather there now? Good?

52
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:33,093
Well, I'm from there originally.
I live here now.

53
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,809
In Sin-Sin City, you know, as I call it?

54
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,731
Not here. The States.

55
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,769
"The States." I like that.

56
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,406
"Across the pond. The States. The trolley.
Cheerio. Put another shrimp on the Barbie."

57
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:48,008
I like all that English stuff.

58
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,578
- Whereabout in "The States"?
- Los Angeles.

59
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:53,981
Oh, La, La. Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah. Tinseltown.

60
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,270
Well, Cincinnati's a great city, too.
Don't knock it.

61
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,459
- I wasn't. I'm sure it is.
- Damn straight.

62
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:03,374
- First time?
- Once before.

63
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:07,528
It's changed since then. You ought to
check it out, you know, while you're here.

64
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,881
- Yeah, I will. Thanks.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

65
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:13,655
Fuck you, asshole!

66
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,571
Yeah, you oughta check it out.

67
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,012
Check it out.

68
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:24,318
The zoo is great. World-class, they say.

69
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,782
Many, many important, you know,
whatchamacallit, endangered species,

70
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:33,926
breeding programs, you know.
It's famous for it. Pandas. Other things.

71
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,659
- Owls.
- That sounds fascinating.

72
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,033
Damn straight.

73
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,867
Yeah, you should check it out.

74
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:51,338
And you gotta try the Cincinnati chili.
It's chili like you never had. Trust me.

75
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,475
LA chili? England chili? Forget about it.

76
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:58,378
They make it here with cinnamon and
chocolate and they serve it over pasta.

77
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,249
- Imagine that if you can.
- I'll try to, yeah. Thanks.

78
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,719
Is there a toy store near the hotel?

79
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:09,189
A toy store? You mean, a "toy" store?

80
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,258
Yeah, toy store.

81
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,595
Yeah, there's a "toy" store
about two blocks up.

82
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,514
It's open all night. Real class place.

83
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:20,251
<i>I have a pickup call at 16th and Lincoln.
Anybody in the area?</i>

84
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:23,319
Anyway, there's a lot to see in the city.
Revitalized downtown...

85
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,518
- I'm only here for a day.
- What?

86
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:28,063
I'm just here for a day.

87
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,981
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm not getting that. The accent.

88
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:37,918
I'm just here for a day.

89
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,454
Well, the zoo then.

90
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:44,057
You don't need more than a day
for the zoo. It's just zoo-sized.

91
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:48,333
And the chili. You only need,
like, an hour for the chili.

92
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,500
Hey, that's Michael Stone.

93
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,304
- Michael Stone.
- Harris, can you get these bags, please?

94
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,979
That's Michael Stone.

95
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,943
Hello. Welcome to The Fregoli.

96
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:07,012
- Hi, I'm checking in. Stone.
- Welcome, Mr. Stone.

97
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:11,685
Oh, there we go. Michael Stone.
Smoking, king-sized bed.

98
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,087
And you'll be with us
for just one night, sir?

99
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,806
One night. Yes.

100
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:18,725
I'll just need to make an imprint
of your credit card, for incidentals,

101
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,229
- and we'll be all set.
- I'd like a quiet room, if you have one.

102
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,937
Yes, sir. Of course.

103
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:42,291
I have a charming deluxe smoking
junior suite on the tenth floor

104
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:45,619
with a king-sized bed.
Far above the street noise.

105
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,255
- That sounds good.
- Great.

106
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,796
So it's all set then.

107
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,959
- Dennis here will show you to your room.
- Thank you.

108
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,083
Right this way, sir. My name is Dennis.

109
00:09:58,183 --> 00:10:00,053
Hi.

110
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,422
After you, sir.

111
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,758
- So how was your trip in?
- It was fine, thanks.

112
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,732
Good.

113
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,570
- Bumpy? At all?
- No.

114
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,035
- I'm sorry?
- No.

115
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,238
Oh, well, you're safe now.

116
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,480
I think the room
will be to your liking, sir.

117
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,749
Just up here to the left, sir.

118
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,190
There you go, after you.

119
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,994
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yeah.

120
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,029
- What?
- Yes.

121
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,170
Yes, the weather is very good.

122
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:10,837
Very, very, very, very good.

123
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,640
Sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit.

124
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,948
And here we are.

125
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,524
After you, sir.

126
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:35,529
It's the bathroom.
Air conditioning and heat controls here.

127
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:40,606
TV, remote control. Mini-bar.
All self-explanatory, I think.

128
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:46,106
Ice machine down the hall. And would you
like me to get you some ice before I leave?

129
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,276
No, I'm okay, thanks. Here you go.

130
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,779
Oh. Thank you very much, sir.

131
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,881
If you need anything at all,
please just give us a ring.

132
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,384
- My name's Dennis.
- Thanks.

133
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:00,325
- Good night.
- Good night.

134
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,877
<i>Touch the door to the room.
If it feels hot, do not open it.</i>

135
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,912
<i>Fill the tub with water, soak a towel,</i>

136
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,849
<i>and place it in the space
at the bottom of the door.</i>

137
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,753
<i>If the door is not hot, you may leave
the room, but bring your room key with you</i>

138
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,452
<i>in case exits are blocked
and you need to get back in.</i>

139
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:41,121
<i>Room service.
How may I help you, Mr. Stone?</i>

140
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,791
- I'd like to order some room service.
- <i>Yes.</i>

141
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:48,161
I'll have the bibb lettuce salad
and the salmon.

142
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,831
<i>Yes, sir. Would you like
anything to drink tonight?</i>

143
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,066
No. I'll find something in the mini-bar.

144
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,702
<i>Very good. Dessert? We have a...</i>

145
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:59,786
- No, no, no, thanks.
- <i>Very good, sir.</i>

146
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,142
<i>So that's a bibb lettuce, gorgonzola,</i>

147
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,944
- <i>prosciutto, and walnut salad.</i>
- Yes.

148
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,209
- <i>With honey raspberry vinaigrette dressing.</i>
- Yes.

149
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:09,082
<i>And the wild-caught copper river
Alaska salmon amandine.</i>

150
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,884
- Yes.
- <i>With baby asparagus...</i>

151
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,119
- Yes.
- <i>...and the black truffle broth.</i>

152
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,422
- Yes.
- <i>Very good.</i>

153
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,759
- <i>And that's for room 1007?</i>
- Yes.

154
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,896
<i>Very good. It's 9:13 now.</i>

155
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,432
<i>It should be there within 35 minutes,
which will make it 9:48.</i>

156
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,599
- Thank you.
- <i>Thank...</i>

157
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,419
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

158
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,122
<i>Oh, hi. You just get in?</i>

159
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,424
I'm at the hotel. How are you?

160
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,628
<i>Pre-menstrual. How was the flight?</i>

161
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,931
- It was okay. A little bumpy.
- <i>Oh, I hate that.</i>

162
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,170
<i>Just a minute, Henry!
No, I'm on the phone!</i>

163
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,405
<i>Just a minute!</i>

164
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,275
- <i>What? No, it's daddy!</i>
- Donna.

165
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,076
- <i>Daddy!</i>
- Donna.

166
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,030
- <i>Daddy!</i>
- Donna!

167
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,086
- <i>He wants to say hi.</i>
- Okay. Donna, I don't want to...

168
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:20,587
<i>Hold on. He's coming downstairs.
He's in his pirate suit.</i>

169
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:24,324
<i>Come on, Henry. Daddy's waiting.</i>

170
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,893
<i>Yes. It's long-distance!</i>

171
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,059
<i>Jesus.</i>

172
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,531
- <i>Here he is.</i>
- Okay.

173
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,863
Hi, slugger.

174
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:38,071
<i>Say something. It's long-distance.</i>

175
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,973
<i>Hi, Daddy. I'm a pirate.</i>

176
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:45,111
Are you? That's great.
I'm glad to hear your voice.

177
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:49,449
- <i>Did you buy me something?</i>
- Not yet. But I will. I just got here.

178
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,016
<i>Okay, I love you. Take care. Bye.</i>

179
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:56,889
- <i>Well, he gets right to the point.</i>
- Yeah.

180
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,222
<i>So...</i>

181
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,095
<i>What else? I mean, how's your room?</i>

182
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,298
It's... you know, it's a room.

183
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,068
It's nice, I guess. Big bed.

184
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,891
<i>Oh, that's good.
You can thrash about all you like.</i>

185
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:14,307
Okay, Donna, it's not that I like it.
It's restlessness.

186
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:18,708
<i>Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

187
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,567
- <i>You doing anything tonight?</i>
- No.

188
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,051
I ordered room service.

189
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:30,458
I'll watch a movie or something.
I don't know. I should get some sleep.

190
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:32,425
<i>Okay.</i>

191
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,228
<i>Well, I better go.</i>

192
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,932
- <i>I've got to get dinner together for Hen.</i>
- Okay. Have a good night.

193
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:44,270
- <i>Okay. Good luck tomorrow.</i>
- Yeah, thanks.

194
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,404
- Okay, bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

- Then why are you still here?
- I'm leaving. I just need to find my wallet.

Why don't you find your balls
while you're at it?

You knew I didn't want to get married.

208
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:36,566
Yeah. Well, you agreed to it.
You're a grownup.

209
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,335
Yeah, I'm a grownup.
You remind me of that every day.

- Well, someone has to.
- Bitch.

211

- You fuck off.

00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,260
My mother was right
when she said you're a bitch.

- Fuck you. Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

Thank you.

It is my privilege today to talk
to you about customer service.

219
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,345
What it is and why...

220
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,882
Shit.

221
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,617
I mean, what the fuck did I do, Michael?

222
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:05,455
It's a goddamn mystery.
It's like the goddamn mystery of the ages.

223
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:07,795
Oh, shit.

224
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:11,552
One minute, we were going to spend
the rest of our lives together,

225
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:14,068
and the next...

226
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,471
Amarossi. Okay.

227
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,776
Hi, Bella. It's Michael.

228
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:37,754
Shit.

229
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:41,023
Hi, Bella, it's Michael. Hi, Bella...

230
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:43,698
Hi, Bella, it's Michael.

231
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,335
Fuck.

232
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,842
Six...

233
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:07,689
<i>Hello?</i>

234
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:13,256
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

235
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:17,693
May I speak to Bella Amarossi, please?

236
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:20,931
- <i>This is Bella.</i>
- Bella?

237
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:25,135
Hi, I wasn't sure... Hi... I...

238
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:29,389
- It's... It's Michael.
- <i>Who is this?</i>

239
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,709
I didn't recognize your voice.

240
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,779
- <i>Michael?</i>
- Michael Stone. Michael Stone. From...

241
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,782
<i>Oh, my God! Michael?</i>

242
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,123
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

243
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:46,656
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm in Cincinnati on business and I...

244
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:49,425
thought of you and I looked you up
in the phone book

245
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:53,101
and there you were, so...

246
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,232
<i>It's good to hear your voice.</i>

247
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:58,534
Yours, too.

248
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:01,442
<i>I'm shaking.</i>

249
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:05,908
- <i>Jesus, how long has it been?</i>
- Ten years.

250
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,743
<i>Eleven.</i>

251
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:09,918
Oh, right.

252
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:13,383
I'm married.

253
00:22:13,683 --> 00:22:15,785
I have a kid.

254
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,593
<i>That's great.</i>

255
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:23,659
- <i>Congratulations.</i>
- Thanks. You?

256
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,633
<i>No.</i>

257
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,032
I've missed you.

258
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:32,006
<i>Yeah.</i>

259
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:36,739
- <i>That's a weird thing to say.</i>
- I know. I'm sorry.

260
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,508
<i>Well...</i>

261
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,944
<i>it doesn't matter.
It's all water under the fucking bridge.</i>

262
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,579
<i>The fucking bridge.</i>

263
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,784
Yeah. Well, I am sorry.
I do think about you a lot.

264
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:53,122
<i>Yeah. I guess the postcards
must've gotten lost in the mail.</i>

265
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:58,594
Do you want to maybe get a drink, Bella?

266
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:03,265
<i>I don't know, Michael.</i>

267
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:05,668
<i>This is all very intense.</i>

268
00:23:05,768 --> 00:23:07,704
<i>It's like out of the blue.</i>

269
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:11,708
<i>I just came out of this stupid relationship
with a psycho. And I just...</i>

270
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,881
<i>I don't know, I'm not sure
you want to be the victim</i>

271
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:17,580
<i>to my current emotional imbalance tonight.</i>

272
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,958
Yeah. Well, I understand.

273
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:27,590
<i>I mean, I could, I guess. I don't know.</i>

274
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,159
<i>Jesus, Michael, it's been so fucking long.</i>

275
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:33,929
- <i>And you just call? Out of nowhere?</i>
- I'm sorry. It was stupid.

276
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:38,439
Everything's just screwed-up.
I'm not thinking straight.

277
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,377
There's something wrong with me.

278
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,410
<i>Well, where are you staying?</i>

279
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,312
The Fregoli.

280
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:52,648
<i>La-di-da, you're doing well.</i>

281
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:57,291
You know. It's boring.
Everything's boring.

282
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:01,266
<i>Okay, I could meet you there.</i>

283
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:05,728
<i>At the bar. I have to go to work early,
so... I can't stay very long.</i>

284
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:07,930
Yeah, that sounds great.

285
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,638
It'll be lovely to see you.

286
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,908
<i>This is really weird.</i>

287
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:16,814
<i>I've gained some weight.</i>

288
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,406
<i>Not terrible or anything, but... so you
don't look at me freaked-out or something,</i>

289
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:23,079
- <i>because I just couldn't handle that.</i>
- I wouldn't do that.

290
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:25,019
<i>Okay.</i>

291
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:30,319
<i>And I have a fake tooth in the front because
I fell and hit a cement bench with my mouth.</i>

292
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,889
<i>But I don't think you can tell.
They matched it pretty well.</i>

293
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:35,864
Okay.

294
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,867
I look forward to seeing you.

295
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,472
- <i>Bye, Michael.</i>
- Bye, Bella.

296
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:03,024
<i>Soak a towel, and place it in the space...</i>

297
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,545
<i>What is the meaning of this, may I ask?</i>

298
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:07,840
<i>Mother, Godfrey loves me.
He put me in the shower.</i>

299
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,678
- <i>What ever are you talking about?</i>
- <i>Godfrey loves me. Godfrey loves me.</i>

300
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,229
<i>I demand an explanation.</i>

301
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:15,563
- <i>I think, perhaps, that I had better resign.</i>
- Yes, I think you'd better.

302
00:25:15,663 --> 00:25:18,067
<i>That's a very good idea. What do you think
your father would say to all this?</i>

303
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,136
<i>I don't care what anybody says.
Godfrey loves me.</i>

304
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,470
<i>Now see here, young lady, you take
a bath and put on some dry clothes.</i>

305
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,519
<i>And come downstairs immediately.
Do you hear?</i>

306
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:27,488
<i>I've never heard of anything
like this in my life.</i>

307
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,359
There you are. Hey.

308
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,402
Michael?

309
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,543
Bella!

310
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:01,911
You look great.

311
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:04,013
Thank you.

312
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,953
You, too.

313
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:08,990
Have a seat. Please.

314
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:16,392
It's really lovely to see you.

315
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,270
Thanks.

316
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:22,665
Let me get the waitress' attention.

317
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:26,073
Excuse me. Excuse me.

318
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,411
It's busier here than I would've thought.

319
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:34,548
Hi. Do you know what you want?

320
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:40,216
- I... what are you having, Michael?
- A Belvedere martini with a twist.

321
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:43,419
Same old Michael. I'll have one of those.

322
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,628
- Make it two.
- Back in a minute.

323
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:49,959
So...

324
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:53,129
You look good.

325
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,669
Tell me what's going on.

326
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:59,869
Not too much. I'm embarrassed to say.

327
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:03,859
I'm working for the state,
doing graphics for the health department.

328
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,309
- Graphics?
- Yeah, I design pamphlets.

329
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:11,047
You know, teen pregnancy, STDs, diabetes.

330
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:13,782
I see. Well, that sounds interesting.

331
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,951
It's okay.

332
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,288
My boss is a dick.

333
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:23,330
I guess that fits right in
with the teen pregnancy and the STDs.

334
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:31,495
- Do I look bad? I look bad, don't I?
- No, you look good.

335
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:41,915
Why did you go, Michael?

336
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,815
I don't know.

337
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,151
I can't explain.

338
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:52,321
Here we are. Two Belvedere
martinis straight-up with twists.

339
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,724
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

340
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:57,293
You're welcome. Enjoy.

341
00:27:57,393 --> 00:27:59,495
Old times.

342
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,868
Old times.

343
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,061
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

344
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,948
- I've missed you.
- Me, too.

345
00:28:16,846 --> 00:28:20,282
- Try to.
- Try to what?

346
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:22,690
Try to explain.

347
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:29,458
I think I might have...

348
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:31,928
psychological problems.

349
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh, good. That clears things up. Thanks.

350
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,428
It's hard to explain.
I've been running for a long time now.

351
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,804
Running?

352
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:45,240
We were special together.
That's what I thought.

353
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,211
Yeah. I agree. But things kind of shifted.

354
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,814
But just like completely suddenly?

355
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:55,589
I was so pissed at you.
I was so fucking hurt.

356
00:28:57,086 --> 00:29:00,055
I didn't get out of bed for a year.

357
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,424
Do you realize that?

358
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:04,332
Jesus.

359
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,202
I'm sorry.

360
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:13,802
God, you drank that fast.

361
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:16,477
I get a lot of practice.

362
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,676
Listen, do you feel that you changed?

363
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:24,180
- I mean, do you feel that you changed?
- What are you talking about?

364
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,384
I don't know. I don't know. Like, in any way?
Like, in any way did you change?

365
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:32,121
Like, while we were together.
Like, did I change you? Did you change?

366
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:35,091
Did anything change?
Did a change occur? Did a...

367
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:39,261
Michael, you're freaking me out. I can't
take being more freaked out right now.

368
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,103
I'm sorry. I'm a mess. I'm just...

369
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:48,237
Do you want to maybe go up
to my room for another drink?

370
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:50,806
We could talk more privately.

371
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:53,402
What? We're not going to fuck, Michael.

372
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,617
I wasn't... I just...

373
00:29:57,146 --> 00:30:00,583
I'm just really bloody lonely,
and we had something.

374
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:03,385
- And I thought maybe we could figure out...
- You've got to be kidding.

375
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:05,354
This isn't going well.
I'll just get the check then. Miss?

376
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:07,423
- Jesus. What?
- Miss?

377
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:10,392
I can't... I can't believe you.

378
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:15,231
- Fuck you, Michael. Fuck off.
- Bella! I'm just trying to understand!

379
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:18,805
- Isn't that Michael Stone?
- It's Michael Stone, yes.

380
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:27,309
...and the next minute you're out the door
with barely a goodbye.

381
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,916
Have a good fucking life, Michael.

382
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:34,121
Love, Bella.

383
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:58,474
Hello. May I help you?

384
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:04,213
Hello there.
I am looking for a toy for my son, Henry.

385
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:07,554
Perhaps you've heard of him,
he's a pirate.

386
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:19,695
Oh, dear, this is not quite
the store I expected.

387
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,297
No, I suppose not those kind of toys.

388
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:24,672
It's not my night.

389
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:28,454
What's... what's that behind you?

390
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,174
Oh, that? That's an antique.
It's Japanese.

391
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:34,715
It's quite unusual.

392
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,585
It's pretty.

393
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:54,062
Hot. Hot.

394
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,970
Hot!

395
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:00,903
Fuck! Fuck!

396
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,772
Cold! Fuck you! Fuck!

397
00:32:03,872 --> 00:32:05,908
Fuck you!

398
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,810
Fuck!

399
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:12,721
Okay. There we go.

400
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:29,688
Anyway, I can't wait to see you
when I get back. How's Thursday?

401
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:32,161
No, it's super-fancy.

402
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:35,497
- Oh, my God. Is he cute?
- Jesus.

403
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,908
Someone else.

404
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:45,941
Where are my fucking pants?

405
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,881
Fuck!

406
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:16,177
Hello, miss? Shit. Shit!

407
00:34:24,012 --> 00:34:24,914
Yes?

408
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:27,583
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was just looking for my friend's room.

409
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:28,884
- Not here.
- I'm sorry.

410
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,058
It's okay.

411
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,930
Hi!

412
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,265
Hello. Can I help you?
I thought you were someone else.

413
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:46,034
No, sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

414
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:48,209
That's okay.

415
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:54,243
Yes? Yes?

416
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:57,045
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for...

417
00:34:57,145 --> 00:35:01,016
- Who is it?
- My name's Michael Stone.

418
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:04,491
Hold on!

419
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,989
Hi! Oh, my God! It's you.

420
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:11,827
- Hi, I'm sorry to bother you...
- No. Not at all!

421
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:14,196
Do you want to come in?

422
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:17,532
I was just looking for someone.
I think I've got the wrong...

423
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,802
- Who's there, Em?
- It's Mr. Stone! Michael Stone!

424
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:22,571
Really?

425
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:24,606
Oh, my God.

426
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,776
Oh, my God. Hello.

427
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,878
Do I look awful?
I was just taking my makeup off.

428
00:35:29,978 --> 00:35:33,215
- Oh, my God. Don't look at me.
- Hello.

429
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:35,217
No, you look lovely.

430
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:37,753
I can't believe you're in our room.

431
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:41,390
We came here from Akron
just to hear you speak.

432
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,327
- Oh, my God. Please don't look at me.
- Well, I'm certainly very flattered.

433
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:47,496
- You can look at me.
- Emily.

434
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:49,398
Is there something we can do for you?

435
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:53,502
I mean... I don't mean that in a weird way.
Although... No, I'm kidding!

436
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:57,389
- I'm just... Oh, my God.
- I was...

437
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,976
I was trying to find my friend.
I thought this was his room. And...

438
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:05,247
Oh, nope. Nope.
Unless he's hiding under the bed!

439
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:09,256
We think you're super-brilliant.
We both read your book.

440
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,715
Yay for your book!

441
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,262
Thank you.

442
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:18,077
Are you ladies in customer services?

443
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:21,496
Well, yes, as a matter of fact,
we're both team leaders in a phone room.

444
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:26,668
We read your book and productivity
went up 90% in our department.

445
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:30,672
You're so smart. I'm not sure I should
even say words in front of you,

446
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,475
because you'll see how dumb I am.
Shut up, Lisa.

447
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:38,280
No, don't. Don't shut up, Lisa.
You have a miraculous voice.

448
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,817
Oh, God, no! Yick. Me?

449
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:44,853
Yick. No way. No way.

450
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,389
Lisa, you're being nuts.

451
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:51,059
Say, would you ladies like to get
a drink at the bar, maybe?

452
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:57,148
We could chat.
Talk about phone system innovations.

453
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:03,705
Yeah. I think we could manage that.
Right, Lisa?

454
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,762
- Do you need to find your friend, though?
- No.

455
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:12,581
Two beautiful ladies trumps my friend.

456
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:16,618
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much. I'm blushing.

457
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:20,021
Yes, thank you so much.

458
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:23,063
I'm blushing, too.

459
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:26,995
I can't believe we bumped into you.

460
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:31,132
You know, we sprung for this hotel
because this is like a mini-vacation for us.

461
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:34,503
We can't even afford it.
But look what happened.

462
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:36,871
It's so worth it.

463
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,791
I love this song.

464
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:45,401
<i># How I long to be near... #</i>

465
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:51,303
Shut up, Lisa.

466
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,110
I even got a massage tonight in the room.

467
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,565
It's good to splurge every now and again.

468
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:59,578
Emily and I work for Tessman in Akron.

469
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:02,747
We're only customer service reps,
so you can imagine our salaries.

470
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,234
- Tessman?
- Tessman Foods.

471
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:09,070
We make packaged bakery items
shipped all over the Midwest.

472
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,973
Nibble-O's, Choco-bricks,

473
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:16,628
Apple-Flats, Strawberry Trifles,
Knick-Knacks, Scroochies?

474
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:20,365
Oh, yes. Yes. Splendid. I'm familiar.

475
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:24,019
- Brownie Balls, don't forget.
- Brownie Balls. Yeah, they're new.

476
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,139
- Hello again. What can I get you?
- Oh, hi.

477
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,242
Do you ladies know what you want?

478
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,929
I'll have an apple mojito, please.
Can you make those with apple schnapps?

479
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:37,366
- Yum. Yum. Yum.
- I think probably.

480
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:40,635
That sounds really, really good.
I'll have the same.

481
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,472
- And for you, sir?
- Belvedere martini,

482
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:47,826
- dry, straight-up, twist.
- I'll be back in a minute.

483
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:51,012
So, what do you ladies do for fun?

484
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:54,616
- Besides drinking?
- Emily, stop! God!

485
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:59,454
- Well, I like to drink.
- I do, too. But we do lots of other things.

486
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,556
- We hike and bike ride.
- Yeah.

487
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:06,561
I love to read. Go to the movies.
I'm pretty good at Scrabble.

488
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:09,631
- Strip poker...
- Emily!

489
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:13,302
- Have you two been friends long?
- Since junior high.

490
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:16,443
Oh, I play the Jew's harp a little.

491
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:21,415
I don't like to say "Jew's harp"
because it's offensive to Jews.

492
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:25,981
Anyway, I bought one of those...
self-teaching...

493
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:28,249
Self-teaching?

494
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:31,378
Is that right? Or is it self-learning?

495
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:33,705
The Jew's harp
is an underrated instrument.

496
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:38,165
I know! People think of it
as just this thing, you know?

497
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,097
Here we are, folks. Two apple mojitos.

498
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:43,465
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

499
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,900
You're welcome. And one more Belvedere
martini for the gentleman.

500
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,836
Thanks.

501
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:50,543
To... us.

502
00:39:51,707 --> 00:39:55,176
Hurry, hurry. We're gonna miss
the elevator. Go. Go, go, go!

503
00:39:55,276 --> 00:39:59,914
Emily, stop it. What floor are we, anyway?

504
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:02,517
- Ten.
- Are you sure? I think...

505
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:06,021
No, I want to press it! Darn it.

506
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:07,923
Sorry. My hand just jumped.

507
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:10,759
- I love pressing the buttons.
- I'm sorry.

508
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:13,294
You always get to press it, Lisa.
Don't be greedy.

509
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:16,898
I know. 'Cause I love it.
It's so... I don't know...

510
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,001
Buttony. No, that's not it.

511
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:22,309
Buttonish?

512
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:26,775
Is it stupid to like to press buttons?

513
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,610
Shut up, Lisa.

514
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,546
Pressing buttons is good clean fun.

515
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:35,384
Exactly! That's exactly right. See, Em?

516
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:39,754
- It was nice getting to meet you ladies.
- It was an honor spending time with you.

517
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,123
- Thank you for all those mojitos!
- My pleasure.

518
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:44,459
Yes, thank you kindly.

519
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,263
Mojitos. Mojitos. What a funny word.

520
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,831
You're welcome.

521
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:55,042
Mojitos.

522
00:41:00,176 --> 00:41:01,691
Well...

523
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:05,377
I go this way, so I'll say good night.

524
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,818
- Oh, pooh.
- Yeah, pooh on you. Pooh, pooh, pooh.

525
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:12,158
Good night, Michael.

526
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:17,017
- Say good night, Lisa.
- Good night, Michael.

527
00:41:17,117 --> 00:41:19,750
- Pooh.
- Good night.

528
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,735
Oh, Lisa?

529
00:41:27,035 --> 00:41:28,409
Yes?

530
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:36,611
I was wondering if maybe you'd want
to come to my room for a little nightcap.

531
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:40,949
I feel odd asking in front of you, Emily.
But I didn't know how else...

532
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:43,651
No, no. That's okay.

533
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,754
I understand.

534
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:48,423
You sure you don't mean Emily?

535
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:51,065
Everyone always likes Emily better.

536
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:56,498
This is awkward.

537
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,668
I'm going to the room, Lisa.
I'll see you later maybe. Have fun.

538
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:03,171
Em, I came here with you.
I'm not going to just abandon you.

539
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:07,015
Oh, don't be an idiot, Lisa.
He's gorgeous.

540
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,046
Yeah, it's okay?

541
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:14,987
Have fun. Good night.

542
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:20,755
So, I'm over this way.

543
00:42:20,855 --> 00:42:22,729
Okay.

544
00:42:24,426 --> 00:42:26,728
- Have fun.
- Good night.

545
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:28,930
Oh, Jesus!

546
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,566
Are you okay?

547
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:35,942
I'm okay, I'm okay.
It happens all the time.

548
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:31,660
Look how neat you left your room,

549
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,828
with the little slippers
laid out next to the bed

550
00:43:33,928 --> 00:43:37,332
and the blanket turned down
all ready for sleepy time.

551
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:40,935
No, the maid did that.
They come and fix it up at night.

552
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:45,707
- It's called turn-down service.
- Oh, God. I'm so embarrassed.

553
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:49,010
Lisa the moron. I don't...
I don't stay in hotels like this.

554
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:52,306
Emily and I splurged, because
it's like a vacation. I'm an idiot.

555
00:43:52,406 --> 00:43:54,649
No, you're not.

556
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:59,354
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, please. I would really like a drink.

557
00:43:59,454 --> 00:44:03,091
I don't think I can make an apple mojito.
I can order one.

558
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:07,735
No, that's okay.
I'll just have a glass of wine, please.

559
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:12,867
I'm glad to get you alone for a while.

560
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:15,475
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

561
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:20,608
You don't like Emily?
Everybody likes Emily.

562
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:23,945
Emily's a prince... ess.

563
00:44:24,045 --> 00:44:27,382
- Emily's a princess.
- She's very nice.

564
00:44:27,482 --> 00:44:32,020
I just felt...
a sort of special thing with you.

565
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,956
Really?

566
00:44:34,956 --> 00:44:37,964
Most people like Emily.

567
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,129
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

568
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,184
Thank you.

569
00:44:53,008 --> 00:44:57,384
Most people don't really like to look
at me too much because, you know...

570
00:45:00,248 --> 00:45:03,384
I think you're lovely.

571
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:06,059
No, you don't.

572
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:09,825
I've always done phone work because
I'd never get hired to work in a store

573
00:45:09,925 --> 00:45:12,232
or a restaurant or...

574
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:16,765
How did it happen?

575
00:45:16,865 --> 00:45:19,885
If it's okay for me to ask?

576
00:45:20,235 --> 00:45:22,037
I don't...

577
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:24,711
I don't like to talk about it.

578
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,015
May I kiss you there?

579
00:45:29,577 --> 00:45:31,784
Oh, my God.

580
00:45:32,113 --> 00:45:35,638
Oh, my God. No. Oh, God.

581
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:37,717
S... sorry.

582
00:45:40,372 --> 00:45:44,325
You're not like a pervert or something?
Like some weird version of a chubby chaser?

583
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:46,266
No.

584
00:45:47,028 --> 00:45:50,837
I just don't understand
why you would want to kiss me there.

585
00:45:51,265 --> 00:45:55,586
Because... because I like you.

586
00:45:57,638 --> 00:45:59,446
Why?

587
00:46:00,108 --> 00:46:03,378
I mean, I'm not smart like Emily.
And I'm ugly.

588
00:46:03,478 --> 00:46:06,381
You're a really smart guy.
You should like Emily.

589
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:10,118
I don't even understand a lot of the words
in your book. I sat there with a dictionary.

590
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:14,489
I try to learn. But I'm never going
to be smart. And I'm ugly.

591
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:19,632
I find it enormously charming that you read
any book with a dictionary next to you.

592
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:53,461
My last boyfriend was eight years ago.
And he wasn't even my boyfriend.

593
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:57,933
He was almost 60 and fat
and he worked in Human Resources

594
00:46:58,033 --> 00:47:01,770
and he had a wife
and his daughter was older than me.

595
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:06,240
And the only reason he pursued me was
because he thought he'd have a good shot.

596
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,414
Which he did.

597
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:12,985
I think you're extraordinary.

598
00:47:20,187 --> 00:47:21,994
Why?

599
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,626
I don't know yet.

600
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:27,695
It's just obvious to me that you are.

601
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:29,698
I never went to college.

602
00:47:29,798 --> 00:47:33,001
I've never even made it past
team leader in my department.

603
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:36,437
Your voice is like...

604
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:38,278
magic.

605
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,114
Oh, really?

606
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:49,651
Well, you know, I have been doing
phone work for a really long time now,

607
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:53,755
so I pride myself on sounding
pleasant and professional,

608
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,991
and having a pleasing
phone voice and manner.

609
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:59,327
It works. Do you sing?

610
00:48:00,827 --> 00:48:03,331
What? No.

611
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:06,935
No! God! You're weird!

612
00:48:07,035 --> 00:48:10,104
I mean, I sing. Everybody sings.
I just don't sing well.

613
00:48:10,204 --> 00:48:12,607
I sometimes sing along with the radio.

614
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:14,876
I love Cyndi Lauper.

615
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,647
Because she's got such a great voice and she
doesn't care what people think about her.

616
00:48:18,747 --> 00:48:22,507
She's just herself, and that takes
a lot of courage. I admire that.

617
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:25,687
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. I think so.

618
00:48:25,787 --> 00:48:28,200
Would you sing one of her songs for me?

619
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,759
- No!
- Come on.

620
00:48:30,859 --> 00:48:33,748
Come on. It'd make me so happy
to hear you sing.

621
00:48:34,028 --> 00:48:38,539
- You're being weird.
- Please. It'll make me happy.

622
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:42,742
I don't know.

623
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,578
Okay, crazy man.

624
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,919
Just a little.

625
00:48:53,214 --> 00:48:55,667
Okay, here goes.

626
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:58,090
Don't laugh at me.

627
00:49:03,825 --> 00:49:07,362
<i># I come home in the morning light</i>

628
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:13,568
<i># My mother says
when you gonna live your life right</i>

629
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:17,672
<i># Oh, mother, dear,
we're not the fortunate ones</i>

630
00:49:17,772 --> 00:49:21,842
<i># And girls, they wanna have fun</i>

631
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:27,048
<i># Oh, girls just wanna have fun</i>

632
00:49:27,148 --> 00:49:30,285
<i># Some boys take a beautiful girl</i>

633
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:35,590
<i># And hide her away
from the rest of the world</i>

634
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:40,361
<i># I want to be the one to walk in the sun</i>

635
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:44,198
<i># And girls, they wanna have fun</i>

636
00:49:44,298 --> 00:49:47,668
<i># Oh, girls just wanna have</i>

637
00:49:47,768 --> 00:49:51,806
<i># That's all they really want</i>

638
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:55,176
<i># Some fun</i>

639
00:49:55,276 --> 00:49:58,813
<i># When the working day is done</i>

640
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:02,717
<i># Oh, girls, they wanna have fun</i>

641
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:08,523
<i># Oh, girls just wanna have fun #</i>

642
00:50:08,723 --> 00:50:10,391
That's beautiful...

643
00:50:10,491 --> 00:50:12,960
<i># Girls, they want</i>

644
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,530
<i># Wanna have fun, girls</i>

645
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,266
<i># They wanna have</i>

646
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:22,036
<i># Just wanna, they just wanna</i>

647
00:50:22,136 --> 00:50:25,373
<i># Just wanna, they just wanna</i>

648
00:50:25,473 --> 00:50:28,609
<i># Oh, girls just wanna</i>

649
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:31,879
<i># Just wanna have fun #</i>

650
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:35,483
Okay. That's it. Happy?

651
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:38,787
- That was so beautiful.
- No, it was...

652
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:42,295
Oh, my God, are those tears?

653
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:45,379
It was beautiful.

654
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:49,898
It's such a great song. "I want to
be the one who walks in the sun."

655
00:50:49,998 --> 00:50:53,640
That describes so perfectly
who I want to be.

656
00:50:54,369 --> 00:50:57,872
You're so sensitive, Michael.
It's incredibly sweet.

657
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,609
It's your voice, Lisa.

658
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:05,353
- Keep talking. Tell me everything.
- You're, like, amazing.

659
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:07,648
Why are you doing this?
Are you making fun of me?

660
00:51:07,748 --> 00:51:10,623
No. No.

661
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:18,676
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

662
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:21,339
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

663
00:51:22,363 --> 00:51:26,551
Will you... will you kiss me again?

664
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,387
I hope to.

665
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,911
I hope you do, too. Sometime.

666
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:08,081
I haven't been with anybody
in eight years.

667
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:15,171
Let's just lie together
and you can tell me about your day.

668
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:19,101
Yes. Okay.

669
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:28,412
Well, Em picked me up at, like, 7:00
this morning so we could drive down here.

670
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:32,917
We stopped at Starbucks
and I got a Grande Mocha Frappuccino.

671
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:34,685
Emily got a Grande Chai.

672
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:37,555
I looked at the road atlas and figured
it's a little over 200 miles,

673
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,991
so at 60 miles an hour,
we could do it in under four hours

674
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:42,660
with bathroom breaks and whatever.

675
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,499
The 71 goes pretty much
straight here, so it was easy.

676
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:51,436
We listened to a lot of No Doubt,
which Em likes.

677
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:54,072
And I brought my Sarah Brightman CDs.

678
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:59,907
She sings this beautiful version of
<i>Girls Just Want to Have Fun</i> in Italian.

679
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:04,486
It's called <i>Le Ragazze Vogliono Meglio.</i>

680
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,718
Do you want to hear it?

681
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,659
Please.

682
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:38,929
- Very pretty.
- Oh, my God, it is.

683
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:41,986
I want to learn Italian someday.
It's so wonderful.

684
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:44,927
It's just so romantic.

685
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:48,097
Keep talking.

686
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:51,595
I like different languages.

687
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,465
I love French and Italian the most.

688
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,301
I don't like German. It sounds mean to me.

689
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,809
All those "ach's."

690
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,573
And I love Japanese, obviously.

691
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:07,778
Oh, I love Portuguese.
I love to listen to Brazilian singers.

692
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:13,351
They sing in Portuguese in Brazil,
a little-known fact.

693
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:17,227
It's kind of weird because
it's the only country in South America

694
00:54:17,327 --> 00:54:19,724
where they sing in Portuguese.

695
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:22,398
It's an anomaly, right?

696
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:25,904
I learned that word in your book.

697
00:54:26,004 --> 00:54:27,632
I like that word.

698
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:31,769
Anomaly. I like the way it sounds
and I like what it means.

699
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,905
I feel like an anomaly.

700
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:37,181
Before I used to know there was
a word for it, it made me

701
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:42,546
feel bad to be different.
Now I kind of like it. Sometimes.

702
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:46,083
I mean, not a lot, but sometimes.

703
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:48,452
It makes me special, sort of.

704
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,860
You know what I mean?

705
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,225
Anomalisa.

706
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:58,496
Oh, I love that!

707
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:02,471
It's like "anomaly" plus my name.

708
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:06,570
Will you call me that all the time?
I guess it's long to say "all the time."

709
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,019
I mean, I guess I'm assuming
there is going to be an "all the time."

710
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:12,443
There's not going to be
an "all the time," is there?

711
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:16,617
It's just now.
Some weird thing for just now.

712
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:20,940
It's okay, though.
It's really nice for just now.

713
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,926
It's an anomaly.

714
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,986
- Sorry. What? Did I tickle you?
- Just a little.

715
00:55:46,086 --> 00:55:47,678
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

716
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:51,349
- Just right there I'm a little ticklish.
- Okay. I won't touch you there.

717
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,588
- No, you can. It's okay.
- No. It's okay.

718
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:55,891
No, it's okay.

719
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:05,801
Do you talk during sex?

720
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,766
God! I don't know! It's been a long time.

721
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,836
Do you want me to?
Or not? I could do either.

722
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,772
If you could.

723
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:18,842
Or just, you know...

724
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:21,750
make some noises.

725
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,715
- Noises?
- Like moaning or something.

726
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:28,558
Oh. Okay. I could do that.

727
00:56:34,024 --> 00:56:36,065
That's nice.

728
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:40,731
- Does this feel okay?
- Yes. Sorry. I'm just... I'm a little shy.

729
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:43,100
Oh, it's fine.

730
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:45,669
- My hair.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

731
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,272
- It's okay. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

732
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:51,491
Maybe if we can just turn
a little bit like this?

733
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:53,465
Sure.

734
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,515
- Is that better?
- Much.

735
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,427
Good.

736
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,260
You feel so good.

737
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,696
You do, too.

738
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,017
What? You don't want that?

739
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:20,555
No, I'm just...
I'm kind of shy about that, too.

740
00:57:20,655 --> 00:57:24,289
Don't be shy. It'll be good.
I really want to.

741
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,844
Okay.

742
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:29,485
Okay, go ahead.

743
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:59,577
You're being quiet. Is it not good?

744
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:02,585
No, it's fine. It's good. It's...

745
00:58:03,181 --> 00:58:07,101
Just a little bit more gentle maybe.
At first, maybe.

746
00:58:07,201 --> 00:58:10,075
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

747
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,725
- Better?
- Yes.

748
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:41,757
Could you come up here, please?

749
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:35,203
That was really nice.

750
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,877
I don't want to lose you.

751
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,551
I lose everyone.

752
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,554
What do you mean?

753
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,858
I don't know.

754
01:00:57,788 --> 01:01:00,162
It doesn't matter.

755
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,579
Hello?

756
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:57,848
<i>Hello, Mr. Stone?</i>

757
01:01:57,948 --> 01:01:59,650
- Yes.
- It's early. Who is it?

758
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,585
<i>Good morning, sir.
My name is Lawrence Gill</i>

759
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:04,688
- <i>and I'm the General Manager of the hotel.</i>
- Yes?

760
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:07,825
<i>I have a matter of some delicacy
I need to talk to you about.</i>

761
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,727
- What's going on?
- Who is it?

762
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:14,636
<i>Would it be possible for you to come down
to my office to chat for a few moments?</i>

763
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:19,336
- I suppose.
- <i>I'd greatly appreciate it.</i>

764
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:22,806
<i>If you take the elevator to the basement
level and turn left when you get off,</i>

765
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:26,843
<i>you'll see the administrative offices.
You can just ask for me.</i>

766
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:30,519
- <i>My name is Lawrence Gill.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

767
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:43,765
Who was that?

768
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,171
Lawrence Gill.

769
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,781
Hello. Lawrence Gill's office.
May I help you?

770
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,884
At 2:30 today.

771
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:09,319
Hello, I'm here to see Mr. Gill.

772
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:11,922
Yes, of course, one moment.

773
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:14,363
- Mr. Gill, a Mr....
- Stone.

774
01:03:14,463 --> 01:03:16,894
A Mr. Stone is here to see you.

775
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:19,917
Yes, sir. You can go right in.

776
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:34,244
Thank you for coming, Mr. Stone.
It's over here.

777
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,280
It's big, I know.

778
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,849
They offered me 300 square
on the fifth floor or this down here.

779
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,319
Not a hard decision, right?

780
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:45,495
Take the golf cart. That's what it's for.

781
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:05,548
Watch out for the sunken meeting area.

782
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:09,213
No, no, you can just go around those.

783
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:11,920
No, don't try to drive through.

784
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,829
There. There you are.

785
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:32,336
Have a seat.

786
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:34,771
Do you like the fish?
I just had them put in.

787
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,940
Salt water tanks.
They're hard to maintain.

788
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,381
Those are leprechaun fish.
The ones with the sort of Irish faces.

789
01:04:41,481 --> 01:04:44,148
Is there some problem?

790
01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:48,435
- No, sir. It's nothing like that.
- What then?

791
01:04:48,535 --> 01:04:51,621
- Nothing.
- Excuse me?

792
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,461
It's just...

793
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:56,535
What?

794
01:04:56,635 --> 01:04:58,408
Well...

795
01:04:58,508 --> 01:05:00,698
Please, I have a conference to attend.

796
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:03,934
Oh, yes, of course. "Customer Service."

797
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:09,273
And I've read your book myself.
Hotel productivity up 90%.

798
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:12,910
You and I are in the same business,
really, when you come down to it.

799
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:16,913
- Service. Wouldn't you agree?
- Yes.

800
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:19,016
Yes.

801
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:22,753
Anyway, I don't know
how to put this, so I'll just put it.

802
01:05:22,853 --> 01:05:26,419
I understand that you had a guest
in your room last night.

803
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:30,260
- Is that a crime?
- No, not at all.

804
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,706
Certainly, hoteliers are in the business
of being discreet about our guests'...

805
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:37,038
- philandering.
- Philandering?

806
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:42,102
No, it isn't that. My choice of words...
It's not about that at all.

807
01:05:42,202 --> 01:05:45,208
How do you even know that, anyway?

808
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,783
Well, I...

809
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,819
Mr. Stone, may I be candid with you?

810
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:53,983
I guess. I don't know
what the hell you're getting at.

811
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:56,658
Well, I...

812
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,362
I love you.

813
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,986
- Right, I'm leaving.
- No, no. Look.

814
01:06:04,086 --> 01:06:07,464
I've never talked to you like this before.
It has not been appropriate.

815
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:11,134
Perhaps it's not still, but I've been unable
to contain myself this morning.

816
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:13,337
I love you.
And I want what's best for you.

817
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:17,274
And if you need to have an affair,
I understand, but have it with me.

818
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:18,876
Goodbye.

819
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:23,619
Have it with anyone at all,
anybody, just not Lisa.

820
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:29,453
No. Wait!

821
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:33,742
We're all here for you.
We're all one for you. Come back!

822
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:44,535
Do you like any of these here?
They're very pretty.

823
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:47,871
That one's Stephanie.
Stephanie, say hello to Mr. Stone.

824
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:51,746
Hello. You can fuck me
if you want, Mr. Stone.

825
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:54,978
Or me.

826
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:57,681
- Any of us.
- Just not Lisa.

827
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:59,388
Not Lisa!

828
01:06:59,488 --> 01:07:01,289
Lisa.

829
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:10,627
Lisa!

830
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:13,268
Here's your breakfast, Mr. Stone.

831
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:25,801
Lisa!

832
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:35,690
Lisa! Lisa!

833
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,555
Yes? Oh, hello, Michael.

834
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:40,490
Where...

835
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,739
- Where is she, Emily?
- She's not here.

836
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:45,163
- Michael?
- Lisa, let's go!

837
01:07:45,263 --> 01:07:47,197
- What?
- Lisa, don't go with him. He's insane.

838
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:48,198
What's going on?

839
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:50,600
I don't have the time to tell you.
Just come!

840
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,570
Where are you taking me?
Em, what's going on?

841
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,773
Oh, for God's sake.
Lisa, pull free from him and come back here.

842
01:07:55,873 --> 01:08:00,187
Where are you going to go, Michael?
Be reasonable. There's nowhere to go.

843
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:04,119
- You're hurting me.
- I'm sorry.

844
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:15,192
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had to get you away. You weren't safe.

845
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:18,395
Safe from what?
What are you talking about?

846
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:22,899
They don't want us to be together.
I think they'll kill you if they need to.

847
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:24,668
- Michael?
- They explained it to me.

848
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:28,872
The hotel manager, he explained it to me.
They're all one person and they love me.

849
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:31,775
Everyone is one person, but you and me.

850
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:34,916
You're the only other person in the world!

851
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,486
Really?

852
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,123
That's so beautiful.

853
01:08:43,222 --> 01:08:45,739
- I'm going to cry.
- No.

854
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,558
We need to stay together. Forever.

855
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:51,495
To protect each other,
to nurture each other.

856
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:55,398
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's...
Are you sure?

857
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,468
Yes.

858
01:08:57,968 --> 01:09:03,340
Yes. Finally. Finally, I've found you.

859
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,943
I've waited so long for someone to...

860
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:09,746
- And you're so smart.
- We have to get out of here.

861
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:11,731
- My clothes. My stuff.
- We'll get new.

862
01:09:11,831 --> 01:09:15,953
- Your wife and son.
- They don't exist. They're just them.

863
01:09:16,053 --> 01:09:18,351
Michael? Michael?

864
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:22,397
Michael? Michael? Michael?

865
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:26,963
Michael! You're having
a nightmare or something.

866
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:30,767
- Oh, man.
- You were thrashing.

867
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,890
- You hit me in the face with your elbow.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

868
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:39,414
Oh, it's okay. I kind of liked it.
It's kind of intimate.

869
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,745
Oh, okay, then. Stick around.

870
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:44,932
I'm sure you'll get more of those.
I'm a sloppy sleeper.

871
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:47,924
You're all sweaty.

872
01:09:48,785 --> 01:09:52,754
- What was the dream?
- I don't know.

873
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:57,899
Something about the hotel manager.

874
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,671
Are you hungry? We could order breakfast.

875
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:10,540
I have to get ready for this speech.

876
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,477
- Can I have scrambled eggs?
- Sure.

877
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:18,214
I love eggs.
Scrambled is my favorite egg style.

878
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,655
What about yours?

879
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:27,197
These eggs are delicious.
They're scrambled perfectly.

880
01:10:27,297 --> 01:10:30,660
- Do you want to try some?
- No. Now here's what I'm thinking.

881
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,730
- Yes?
- I want to be with you.

882
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,165
What do you mean?

883
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:39,202
I need to be with you.
I want to leave my wife.

884
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:42,555
Really? Michael,
that's a big decision. I don't...

885
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:47,282
No, no, no, it's something I have to do.
I mean, if you're interested.

886
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:52,334
I mean, yeah. I mean, it's awfully sudden.
I mean, I don't...

887
01:10:52,434 --> 01:10:56,433
want to be responsible for breaking up
a marriage. Do we need to decide now?

888
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,789
It's been years
since I've felt anything like this.

889
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:02,668
It's like a floodgate has opened.
I can't close it. I don't want to.

890
01:11:02,768 --> 01:11:05,033
I love you.

891
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:07,497
Okay.

892
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:10,767
I don't know. It seems so big and...

893
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:14,641
Oh, gosh, okay. Yeah, let's do it.

894
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,575
Great! This is so great!

895
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:20,644
Anomalisa.

896
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:24,882
So, I'll call Donna and tell her.

897
01:11:25,182 --> 01:11:29,352
- No, maybe I should go and see her, right?
- Yeah, that sounds right.

898
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,789
- I think that's such an important...
- Could you not...

899
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:35,658
You're clicking your fork against
your teeth. Could you not do that?

900
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:38,395
Oh, sorry.
People have told me that before.

901
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:42,966
- I know, it's a stupid unconscious habit.
- It's okay. Anyway, you were saying?

902
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,202
Just that I think it's more respectful.

903
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:48,395
And you need to speak to Henry
and explain that this isn't about him.

904
01:11:48,495 --> 01:11:50,824
But it is. It's about him, too.

905
01:11:52,576 --> 01:11:55,028
Well, don't tell him that.
He's just a little boy.

906
01:11:55,128 --> 01:11:58,203
Yeah. You're right.

907
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:03,453
You're being a little controlling,
don't you think?

908
01:12:03,553 --> 01:12:05,789
- I don't mean to. I'm sorry.
- No, that's okay.

909
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:07,391
Good. I'm glad...

910
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:10,460
Please don't talk with food
hanging out of your mouth.

911
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,931
- Oh, sorry. I'm a pig. Sorry.
- No. No, no, no. It's okay.

912
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:18,101
So, will you live in Los Angeles,
or do you need to stay in Ohio?

913
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,943
I'm sorry. Hold on.

914
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,217
I can move to Los Angeles.
I could do that.

915
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,186
Good.

916
01:12:36,286 --> 01:12:39,989
We should go to the zoo today after
your speech. I hear it's really good.

917
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:44,228
They have breeding programs
for all these endangered species.

918
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:47,497
I'm sorry, what did you say?

919
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:50,867
They have breeding programs
for all these endangered species.

920
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:55,338
So you get to see things like pandas,
which I think are awfully cute.

921
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:59,109
They're not really bears, I read.

922
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,718
Yeah.

923
01:13:00,818 --> 01:13:04,450
Sure. That sounds fine.

924
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:09,801
- What is it?
- Nothing. The zoo sounds good.

925
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:15,530
My stomach hurts.
It feels empty. It's clenched.

926
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:19,700
Well, eat some more waffle maybe?

927
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:24,172
Did I do something wrong?

928
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,804
I'm sorry. Darling.

929
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:29,978
It's okay.

930
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,309
I'm anxious about my speech, I suppose.

931
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:37,803
Of course. Well, we'll have fun after.
We don't have to go to the zoo.

932
01:13:37,903 --> 01:13:41,448
We can just hang out here. I have the whole
weekend till I have to get back to work.

933
01:13:41,548 --> 01:13:43,353
That's great.

934
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:45,755
I'm so happy, Michael.

935
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:49,264
I've waited for someone
like you my whole life.

936
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:52,467
I've waited, too.

937
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:56,097
- We'll work it all out, right?
- Yes.

938
01:13:56,197 --> 01:13:59,769
Who would've thunk it?
It's just so beautiful.

939
01:13:59,869 --> 01:14:02,105
Life can be.

940
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:05,079
Things can work out. That's the lesson.

941
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:09,921
Sometimes there's no lesson.
That's a lesson in itself.

942
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:13,454
I guess so.

943
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:19,172
I feel anxious, Michael. I feel something.
Like you're different-acting.

944
01:14:19,272 --> 01:14:22,225
Me? No, no, no.
Everything's fine. I'm just...

945
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:24,261
I know.

946
01:14:24,361 --> 01:14:26,458
I'm not great to look at
in bright sunlight.

947
01:14:26,558 --> 01:14:29,332
No, you're very pretty.

948
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:31,267
Okay.

949
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:33,970
So, we could maybe go out for a walk

950
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:37,345
- and talk or something.
- Yes.

951
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:41,115
- So I'll see you after?
- Of course.

952
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,054
And...

953
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:52,841
Always remember,
the customer is an individual.

954
01:14:53,793 --> 01:14:56,078
Just like you.

955
01:14:56,430 --> 01:15:00,197
Each person you speak to has had a day.

956
01:15:00,297 --> 01:15:02,675
Some of their days have been good,

957
01:15:02,775 --> 01:15:06,274
some bad, but they've all had one.

958
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:10,607
Each person you speak to
has had a childhood.

959
01:15:10,707 --> 01:15:13,209
Each has a body.

960
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:17,252
Each body has aches.

961
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,752
What is it to be human?

962
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,226
What is it to ache?

963
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:30,631
What is it to be alive?

964
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:34,431
I don't know.

965
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:40,441
What is it to ache? I don't know.
What is it to be alive? I don't know.

966
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:47,677
Yes. "How do I talk to a customer?"
How do I talk to a customer?

967
01:15:47,777 --> 01:15:51,681
These are the important questions
for a customer service representative.

968
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:55,251
What do I say?
Do I smile while I'm on the phone?

969
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:59,055
Well, they can tell if you're smiling
even if they can't see you.

970
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:03,559
Did you know that? Try it as an experiment
on the phone with a friend.

971
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:06,500
Try it, go ahead. Watch.

972
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,639
I'm lost.

973
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:18,213
You see, I was smiling when I said that.
I've lost my love.

974
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:23,713
She's an unmoored ship drifting off
to sea. And I have no one to talk to.

975
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:28,222
I have no one to talk to.
I have no one to talk to.

976
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:34,205
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to burden you with that.

977
01:16:34,305 --> 01:16:38,376
I just don't know
what else to do because...

978
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:41,769
I have no one to talk to.

979
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:48,919
Be friendly to the customer.
Think of the customer as a friend.

980
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:58,081
I want to cry, but I can't.

981
01:16:58,181 --> 01:17:00,583
Is it the Zoloft, Dr. Horowitz?

982
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:02,957
Is it the Zoloft?

983
01:17:11,528 --> 01:17:14,430
My face squeezes into that crying contortion
you all know so well

984
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:18,148
but nothing comes out. I need tears.

985
01:17:18,701 --> 01:17:21,642
It's like not being able to come.

986
01:17:23,173 --> 01:17:28,289
I need tears to tear me in two
and let this nightmare escape, but...

987
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:36,546
Anyway, yes, don't forget to smile.
It makes a person's day.

988
01:17:36,646 --> 01:17:39,638
And what does it cost you?
A smile is free.

989
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:44,461
This is not working. This is not working.
This is not working.

990
01:17:44,561 --> 01:17:47,463
The world is falling apart.

991
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:50,066
The president is a war criminal.

992
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:56,459
America is going down the tubes and you're
talking about goddamn intelligent design.

993
01:17:56,559 --> 01:18:00,009
They've intentionally destroyed
the public education system

994
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:04,314
because it's easier to manipulate
dumb workers and soldiers.

995
01:18:04,414 --> 01:18:07,722
There's no need for that!
Support our troops!

996
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:17,794
- I thought this was about customer service.
- Be personable.

997
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:21,347
Remember to believe in yourself.
Believe in your company.

998
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,822
And your products or services.

999
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:29,410
I sweat onto my pillow every night.

1000
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:33,714
I think there's something
very, very wrong with me.

1001
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:41,756
Be friendly.

1002
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:48,257
Yes, what does it cost you? Look for
what is special about each individual.

1003
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:51,865
Focus on that during your conversation.

1004
01:18:56,098 --> 01:19:00,536
Our time is limited. We forget that.

1005
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:02,839
Death comes, that's it.

1006
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:05,680
Soon it's as if we never existed.

1007
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:09,651
So, remember to smile.

1008
01:19:11,948 --> 01:19:15,217
Remember there is someone
out there for everyone.

1009
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:19,755
Someone to love. Remember every
person you speak to needs love.

1010
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:22,129
Remember to...

1011
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:34,437
- Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
- Slugger!

1012
01:19:34,537 --> 01:19:36,293
- What'd you bring me?
- In the bag.

1013
01:19:36,393 --> 01:19:39,275
- Let me look! Let me look!
- He gets right to the point.

1014
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,061
- Hi, honey.
- Is this it?

1015
01:19:41,161 --> 01:19:42,101
- Yup.
- What is it?

1016
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:45,601
- A toy.
- It's... it's a doll.

1017
01:19:45,701 --> 01:19:48,785
- It's for girls. It's a girls' doll.
- No. It's a toy, an antique. It moves.

1018
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:52,567
- It's stupid, and the face is broken.
- It's an antique. That's part of its charm.

1019
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:55,091
I don't get it. I don't get it.
What are these words here?

1020
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:58,795
I don't know. It's in Japanese.
Press some buttons. It moves.

1021
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:01,497
- What else did you get me?
- I didn't get you anything else...

1022
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:04,433
- Surprise!
- Jesus! That scared me!

1023
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,535
Welcome home, honey.
It's a surprise party.

1024
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,505
I don't... Who are all these people?

1025
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:13,202
- Michael, it's great to see you.
- Yeah. Oh, thanks. Who are they?

1026
01:20:13,302 --> 01:20:15,544
- It's everybody, honey.
- What's it doing now, Daddy?

1027
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,583
- I don't recognize any of them.
- Michael, how are you?

1028
01:20:17,683 --> 01:20:19,937
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, how are you?
- Daddy, what's coming out of the toy?

1029
01:20:20,037 --> 01:20:22,485
- I don't know.
- God, Michael, it looks like semen.

1030
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:25,087
I don't know. I just got it at a store.
I don't know.

1031
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,455
What's semen, Mommy?

1032
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:29,964
It's just a liquid, Henry.
It's just a liquid.

1033
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:33,929
Michael, do you realize that we love you?

1034
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:35,903
Henry.

1035
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:38,873
Me.

1036
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,476
All of us here.

1037
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:49,578
Who are you, Donna?

1038
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,797
Who are you, really?

1039
01:20:51,897 --> 01:20:54,316
Oh, for fuck's sake!

1040
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:58,257
I'm sorry, Henry. Mommy said a bad word.

1041
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:00,823
But for fuck's sake, Michael.
I don't know who I am.

1042
01:21:00,923 --> 01:21:04,580
I mean, who are you? Who is anyone?

1043
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,135
Who could answer that question?

1044
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:12,986
I don't want you to leave.

1045
01:21:13,086 --> 01:21:15,738
- Donna, I'm not leaving.
- Is Daddy leaving?

1046
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:18,441
Of course not, slugger.

1047
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:20,657
Where would I go?

1048
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:28,489
- Donna?
- I'm sorry.

1049
01:21:31,403 --> 01:21:34,140
Well, good to see you.

1050
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,832
Thanks very much.

1051
01:21:39,003 --> 01:21:42,656
- Daddy, what's it doing now?
- Singing, slugger.

1052
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,004
Can I go out and play?

1053
01:21:48,104 --> 01:21:52,838
Yeah, sure. I'll stay here
and listen to it till it's over.

1054

1055
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:28,411
<i>Dear Michael, I'm sorry
to see you go, but I understand.</i>

1056
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:30,580
<i>Well, I don't understand, but I accept it.</i>

1057
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,783

love like this was.</i>

<i>Maybe someday we'll meet again
under better circumstances.</i>

01:22:46,863 --> 01:22:51,906
<i>Love, Lisa "Anomalisa" Hesselman.</i>

1061
01:22:58,007 --> 01:22:59,776
<i>P.S.</i>

1062
01:22:59,876 --> 01:23:03,179
<i>I looked up "Anomarisa"
in my Japanese-English dictionary.</i>

1063
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:07,280
<i>It turns out it means "Goddess of Heaven."</i>

1064

<i>Not that I think of myself
that way, of course.</i>
