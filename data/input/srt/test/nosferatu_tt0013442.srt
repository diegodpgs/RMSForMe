00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:55,796
A chronicle of the Great Death
of Wisborg in the year 1838 A.D.

2
00:01:56,796 --> 00:02:13,295
Nosferatu! Does not this name sound
like the very midnight call of Death?

3
00:02:13,296 --> 00:02:30,795
Speak it not aloud, or life's pictures
will turn to pale shadows,
and nightmares will rise up to feed on your blood.

4
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:40,296
I have long meditated on the rise and fall of the
Great Death in my home town of Wisborg.

5
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:50,896
Here is the story: In Wisborg there lived a man
called Hutter with his young wife Ellen...

6
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:33,423
"Why have you destroyed them - the beautiful flowers?"

7
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:59,923
"Not so hasty, my young friend!
No one escapes his destiny."

8
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:18,423
There was also a house agent called Knock,
a strange man, and the center of much gossip.
One thing was sure: he paid his people well.

9
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:31,002
"Count Orlok - His Grace - from Transylvania - wants to
buy a beautiful house - in our little town..."

10
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:39,502
"You could make a nice bit of money."

11
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:54,502
"You will have a marvellous jorney -
What matter if it costs you a bit of pain -
or even a little blood?"

12
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:47,002
"He wants a handsome deserted house..."

13
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:09,002
"That house - just opposite yours. Offer him that!"

14
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:21,502
"Leave at once, my young friend.
Have a quick journey into the land of phantoms!"

15
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:48,001
"I may be away for several month, dear Ellen, away
in a country of ghosts and robbers."

16
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:39,001
Thus Hutter gave the grief-stricken woman into the care of
his friends, the rich shipbuilder Harding and Ruth, his sister.

17
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:03,001
"Do not fear."

18
00:11:55,001 --> 00:12:10,501
From relay to relay, through the dust raised by the stages,
Hutter hurried on until the peaks of the Carpathian mountains
loomed up ahead.

19
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:25,501
"My dinner - quickly - I must hasten to Count Orlok's castle!"

20
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:06,501
"You must leave now! The evil spirits become all-powerful after dark!"

21
00:15:49,001 --> 00:16:01,001
The Book of the Vampires

22
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:16,001
From the seed of Relial came the vampire Nosferatu which liberty and
feedeth on the blood of mankind and abideth,

23
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:25,501
unredeemed, in horrible Darkness,
on the cursed earth from the graveyards of the Black Death.

24
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:35,501
Nosferatu, a name that ringeth like the cry of a bird of prey.
Speak it not aloud!

25
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:21,423
"Drive on! The sun is setting!"

26
00:19:54,923 --> 00:20:01,423
"We will go no further! Not for a fortune!"

27
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:19,423
"We will go no further! Here begins the land of the phantoms!"

28
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:59,423
And when he had crossed the bridge, the phantoms came to meet him.

29
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:07,079
"You are late, young man. It is almost midnight.
My servants have all retired."

30
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:37,579
"Blood! Your precious blood!"

31
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:34,579
"Shall we stay up together for awhile?
It is a long time until sunrise during the day,
my friend, I truly sleep the deepest sleep."

32
00:26:51,079 --> 00:27:00,079
As soon as the sun rose Hutter felt himself
freed from the shadows of the night.

33
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:28,885
Dearest Ellen! Do not grieve because your beloved is far away...

34
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:53,385
...the mosquitoes are reals pests. I have been stung at the neck by
two at once, very close together, one on each side...

35
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:09,385
One's dreams are heavy in this deserted castle, but do not fear...

36
00:30:52,885 --> 00:31:04,385
With twilight the empty castle came alive again with menacing shadows.

37
00:31:42,385 --> 00:31:46,885
"Your wife has a beautiful neck..."

38
00:31:57,163 --> 00:32:03,663
"I shall take the house - the handsome deserted house opposite yours..."

39
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:41,663
From the seed of Relial came the vampire Nosferatu which liveth
and feedeth on the blood of mankind and abideth,

40
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:47,663
unredeemed, in horrible Darkness,
on the cursed earth from the graveyards of the Black Death.

41
00:32:52,977 --> 00:33:03,977
At night said Nosferatu sinketh his fangs into victim and feeds
on the blood that constitues his hellish elixir of life.

42
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,976
At the same hour...

43
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:15,476
"Ellen!"

44
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:28,476
"Fetch a doctor...a doctor!"

45
00:35:54,976 --> 00:35:56,976
"Thomas!!!"

46
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:05,476
"A harmless blood condition!"

47
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:22,476
The doctor described Ellen's anxietes as if the had been trifles.
But I know that in that night her soul had heard the call of death.

48
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:37,476
Already, Nosferatu was raising his wings.
And Hutter, far away, had heard her cry of warning.

49
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:19,523
"Ellen! Ellen!"

50
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:21,023
The raftsmen little suspected what
terrible cargo they carried down the valley.

51
00:42:00,523 --> 00:42:12,523
"The peasants brought him into the hospital yesterday.
They said he fell from a mountain. He is still feverish."

52
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:29,523
"Coffins..."

53
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:46,523
Nosferatu was on the way,
and with him catastrophe approached Wisborg.

54
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:56,023
Professor Bulwer, who studied the secrets of nature, later told me about it. 

55
00:42:56,023 --> 00:43:05,023
The Empusa was chartered and carried his coffins filled with earth.

56
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:27,523
The ship must set sail this night. 

57
00:43:38,023 --> 00:43:53,023
Cargo for Empusa
Destination: Wisborg

58
00:44:51,523 --> 00:45:09,523
At the same time, professor Bulwar explained 
to his pupils the cruelty of carnivorous plants. 

59
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:19,523
Nature's secrets were revealed to horrified eyes.

60
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:05,023
Is it not... like a vampire!

61
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:18,523
Already, Nosferatus's drawing near seemed to
affect Knock, the house agent.

62
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:35,023
"The patient who was brought in
yesterday has gone out of his mind!"

63
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:11,023
"Blood is life! Blood is life!!!!"

64
00:47:46,023 --> 00:47:49,523
"And this one..."

65
00:47:53,523 --> 00:47:57,523
"...a polyp with tentacles..."

66
00:48:06,523 --> 00:48:11,523
"Transparent - almost without substance..."

67
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:24,023
"No more than a phantom..."

68
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,023
"Spiders-"

69
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:22,523
Ellen was often seen alone among the dunes. Longing for her beloved,
she searched the waves and the distant horizon.

70
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:22,523
One's dreams are heavy in this deserted castle, but do not fear...

71
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:43,523
I am leaving immediately to return to Wisborg - and to you.

72
00:52:18,523 --> 00:52:25,523
"No I have to get away - reach home by the shortest possible way!"

73
00:54:00,023 --> 00:54:36,523
New Plague Baffles Science

74
00:55:48,023 --> 00:55:54,523
"A sailor has fallen ill below deck.
He is talking in a fever."

75
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:29,023
Like an epidemic it spread over the entire ship. The first sailor who had
shown the symptoms was followed by the entire crew into the dark grave of
the waters.

76
00:57:29,123 --> 00:57:39,523
In the light of the setting sun the captain and his first mate said
farewell to the last of their companions.

77
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:18,023
"I shall go down! If I haven't come up again within ten minutes..."

78
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:32,023
The ship of death had a new captain

79
01:01:07,023 --> 01:01:13,023
It is a difficult to imagine how young Hutter, his energies sadly
dectimated, managed to surmoung the difficulties of his homeward journey.

80
01:01:07,023 --> 01:01:19,523
At the same time, driven by the fatal breath of the vampire,
the vessel moved rapidly toward the Baltic.

81
01:02:28,465 --> 01:02:32,965
"I must go to him. He is approaching!!!"

82
01:04:26,465 --> 01:04:32,965
The Master is coming! The Master is here!"

83
01:05:41,965 --> 01:05:58,465
I have given much thought to the notion that Nosferatu travelled
with coffins filled with earth.

84
01:05:58,465 --> 01:06:16,465
Then I discovered that vampires draw their shadowy power from the
cursed ground in which they are buried.

85
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:12,965
"I have examined everything - there is no living soul on board."

86
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:19,465
Varna-July 12.
Crew, apart from myself, the captain-one helmsman,
one mate, and five sailors. Departing for the Dardanellas.

87
01:12:23,465 --> 01:12:38,090
2nd day: July 13.
One sailor has contracted a fever. Course: SSW. Direction of wind:

88
01:12:38,204 --> 01:12:49,465
3nd day: July 14.
Mate has begun to hallicunate, says a strange passenger is below deck.
Course:SE. Direction of wind: NE. Volume of wind:3.6

89
01:12:56,965 --> 01:13:08,465
10th day: 22 July.
Passed Gibraltar - Panic on board - Three men dead already -
mate out of his mind - Rats in the hold - I fear the plague...

90
01:13:15,465 --> 01:13:22,965
"The plague is upon us! Go home! Shut all your windows and doors!"

91
01:14:11,465 --> 01:14:22,145
All citizens are notified that the honourable magistrate of this town
prohibits the moving of plague-victims

92
01:14:22,261 --> 01:14:31,465
into hospitals to prevent the plague from spreading through the streets.

93
01:16:12,465 --> 01:16:25,465
Hutter had made Ellen promise not to touch the book which had given
him such terrifying hallucinations.

94
01:16:25,466 --> 01:16:33,465
Yet she was unable to withstand its strange fascination.

95
01:16:36,465 --> 01:16:43,965
One can recognize that mark of the vampire by the trace of his
fangs on the victim's throat.

96
01:18:06,465 --> 01:18:10,965
"Look! Every night, in front of me..."

97
01:19:26,965 --> 01:19:35,965
Panic seized the people. Who was sick or dying?
Who would be stricken tomorrow?

98
01:19:46,965 --> 01:19:50,965
"I shall run over there quickly. I shall get Sievers..."

99
01:21:00,465 --> 01:21:05,965
Wherefore there is no salvation therefrom except that a woman pure
in heart were to make the vampire forget the cock's first crowing.

100
01:21:06,064 --> 01:21:11,465
Of her own free will would she have to give him her blood.

101
01:21:19,965 --> 01:21:27,465
The panic-stricken town was looking for a scape-goat. It chose Knock.

102
01:21:36,965 --> 01:21:46,965
"They saw him escape - he strangled his keeper!"

103
01:21:55,965 --> 01:22:00,465
"He strangled him! The vampire!"

104
01:26:46,465 --> 01:26:50,465
"Bulwer! Fetch Bulwer!"

105
01:29:33,965 --> 01:29:38,465
"Master! Master! Beware!"

106
01:30:49,965 --> 01:30:53,965
"The master...is...dead."

107
01:31:20,965 --> 01:31:23,465
"Thomas!"

108
01:32:09,965 --> 01:32:16,965
And the miracle shall be told in truth.
At that very hour the Great Death ceased and

109
01:32:16,966 --> 01:32:24,965
the shadow of the empire vanished as if
overcome by the victorious rays of the living sun.

110
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:39,445
The End
