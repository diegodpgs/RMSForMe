1
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,778
[man 1]
You bringing Micky in?

2
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:46,779
[man 2]
Yeah, he's gonna come.

3
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:48,781
[man 1] He should
be here as well.

4
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,783
[man 2] You think
he'll answer questions?

5
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,069
They said it was gonna be
both of us here.

6
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,073
- Am I looking right in the camera here?
- Just look at me, right here.

7
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:01,577
All right. You don't want me to
look in the camera with the...

8
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:04,046
- Right over here.
- ...interviews?

9
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,667
[man 1] I started boxing
when I was 12 years old,

10
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,886
and I'd lie and say I was 18,
or whatever it was.

11
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,888
You know, I had a different
name and everything.

12
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,973
I mean, I don't know
how many fights...

13
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,926
I'd done a hundred, more than
that, before I turned professional.

14
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:21,180
- [man 2] Go ahead and sit right there.
- Why we doing this?

15
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,182
- I don't wanna do this.
- You want to start again?

16
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,985
[man 1] This is my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.

17
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,271
I'm still his trainer. You
know, we got different styles.

18
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:33,358
I'm fuckin' squirrelly as fuck.
I'm like... I'm not even there.

19
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,860
You know, that's
what Sugar Ray said.

20
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,780
I was the most tricky fighter
he'd ever come across.

21
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,666
In '78, I fought
Sugar Ray Leonard.

22
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,168
I went toe-to-toe with him.
He couldn't get to me.

23
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,170
He couldn't get to me.

24
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,173
They called me the pride...
the pride of Lowell.

25
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,626
Everybody still talks about it,
especially my brother.

26
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,511
His whole life he wanted
to do what I did, you know?

27
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,964
But we're very
different fighters.

28
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:57,466
Micky's, you know,
he's a heavy hitter.

29
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,968
He's got... a thunderous,

30
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,439
I'm telling you,
thunderous left punch.

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,858
Micky, he gets you and
he takes a punishment,

32
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,893
I don't know why he does it, till
you're right fuckin' in there.

33
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,729
He likes getting on the
inside, I stay on the outside.

34
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,566
[clattering, scraping]

35
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,510
Come on.

36
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:44,513
[Micky] Dicky.

37
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,520
Would you come on?

38
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:54,523
Will you stop...?
You gotta help me finish this.

39
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:57,993
- Come on!
- [Dicky shouts indistinctly]

40
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:00,028
- And predictable as ever.
- All right.

41
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,497
- You don't need to be Columbo
- Here you go.

42
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,031
to see where this
fight is headed.

Bam! Over right hand

45
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:08,537
- puts Micky Ward down!
- [melodramatic groaning]

46
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:11,507
HBO's making a movie
on me and my comeback!

47
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,009
And my brother is gonna beat

Saoul Mamby
in Atlantic City next week!

49

The pride of Lowell is back!

84
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,270
You know, like I said, sometimes
he goes on his own schedule

85
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,106
but when he gets here, we work hard.
You know, nobody pushes me harder.

86
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,359
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

Why don't you just go talk to them,

ain't here, Alice.

coming up and he's not training.

103

Don't. Just forget about him.
He's number two man.

I've been collecting for years.

110
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,517
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

111
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,435
Taught ya everything,
didn't he, honey?

112

In '78, we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

That's a good possibility.

I would like to say at this time

they're just about equal.

152
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,344
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Dick, you're an asshole.

153
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,845
[HBO producer] Hold it, hold it.
Let me get this straight.

154
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,683
You guys are working in the same
corner as Micky, together, right?

155
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,068
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my
corner, and this is what goes on.

156
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,989
- [HBO producer] OK. - [Alice] Don't you
have a job to go to or something?

157
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,825
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

158
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,111
[HBO producer] Yeah, Sergeant
O'Keefe's working overtime here.

159
00:09:56,112 --> 00:10:00,532
So we got Saoul Mamby, Jewish,
black, former world champ.

160
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,534
I think we got
all the bases covered.

161
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,536
And my kid brother,

162
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,038
he's lost
three fights in a row.

163
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,040
You know, he can't get used
to losing. It's a mental thing.

164
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,543
But we're gonna break
that with Mamby, right?

165
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,044
Yeah, I hope,
if we can train...

166
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,547
We can train, right. Enough of
you wasting time, Mick. You know?

167
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,048
- Wasting time?
- Half the fuckin' day's gone!

168
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,050
- We got work to do.
- Yeah, half the day's gone,

169
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,353
- and I been waiting here for you.
- You wanna win?

170
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:22,687
- [# The Breeders: Saints]
- # I like all the different people #

171
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,690
# I like every kind of fair #

172
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,694
# In a crowd
you bet I'll be there #

173
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,697
Jab, two, three, four.
Left, right, punch right. Jab...

174
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,202
And again!
One, two, three, four...

175
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,705
One, two, three, four,
five... Jab, jab...

176
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,575
[Alice] There you go!
There you go!

177
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,960
[bell dings]

178
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,963
# Saints alive you're saying #

179
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:51,333
# Walk in... squares #

180
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,667
[Dicky] Come on, move!

181
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:56,838
Might as well drop the weight,
we're gonna out-box Mamby. Huh?

182
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,340
- [Alice] Take it out on the mitts.
- [Dicky] Head, body, head.

183
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:00,342
That's your fuckin' combo.
Head, body, head.

184
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,844
[Alice] Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

185
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:06,014
You know,
Sugar Ray's gonna be there,

186
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,016
calling the fight for ESPN.

187
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:12,020
- I ain't seen him since I knocked him down.
- [chuckling]

188
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,356
Like 14 years ago
or somethin'. Right?

189
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:16,658
Hook!

190
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:18,660
[Alice] Let's get
a real sparring going on here.

191
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:20,528
[Dicky] Don't wanna
embarrass yourself.

192
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,864
Don't wanna embarrass yourself in
front of Sugar Ray, do you, Mick?

193
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,000
- [Alice] You got him...
- [Dicky] Come on. Head, body, head!

194
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,452
- [Dicky] Ooh, fuck.
- [Alice] Oh!

195
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,455
- Fuckin' yeah. That's your punch, Mick.
- Oh, my God.

196
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,540
- [Dicky] That's your punch.
- [Alice laughing]

197
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,377
[Dicky] That's your liver punch. It
shuts the whole fuckin' body down.

198
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:38,763
George's fingers are so fuckin'
fat, he can't even dial the phone!

199
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,266
- [chatter, laughter]
- Hey, right there, Tar!

200
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,269
- That's not helping, George!
- [laughter]

201
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,471
- Hold on. Wait a minute. I'm confused.
- [woman] What?

202
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,473
- Yeah, I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

203
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,393
- George is whose father?
- You're confused? [chuckles]

204
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,395
Dick Eklund Sr. is Dicky's...

205
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,897
...Donna's, Gail's
and Phyllis's father.

206
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,816
- Is Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

207
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,486
And even though Alice is an
Eklund, so is Cindy and Cathy,

208
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,489
- George is really their...
- And Micky...

209
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,991
- No. Micky and I are...
- [overlapping] Sherri Ward.

210
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,493
- We're Wards.
- The Wards.

211
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:12,464
It's not the way it sounds. Dick
Eklund and I were separated, right?

212
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,967
And then there was George,
just George. George is my man.

213
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:19,471
- Georgie's our poppa.
- After Dick, it was just George.

214
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,839
[overlapping chatter, laughter]

215
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,892
[man] Charlene! Charlene!

216
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:27,929
Hey, Charlene!

217
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,230
We're doing shots with Charlene!

218
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:31,316
- Yeah, you get over here.
- Come on! Come over here.

219
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,487
- [Charlene] Come on, drink yours.
- [all chattering]

220
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,739
[man] On the count
of three... Three!

221
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,658
- [all cheering]
- [bell dings]

222
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,661
Good job, fellas.
Oh, hey, one more time.

223
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,663
[dings]

224
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:53,288
Why don't you just go talk
to her? She's a nice girl.

225
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,841
I told her
all about you.

226
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,343
[Micky] I don't wanna ask her
if she's gonna say no.

227
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:02,347
[George scoffs] Can't
beat that ass, can ya?

228
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,682
Get out of the booth.

229
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,602
Come on. Come on.

230
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:10,221
[blender whirring]

231
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:16,060
Are you just gonna stand
there and stare at my ass?

232
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,062
Your father stares
at my ass,

233
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,482
but he talks to me.

234
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:21,950
Thinks you're the greatest.

235
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,451
He didn't tell me
you were mute.

236
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,320
[man] Keep
the change, doll.

237
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:26,738
He told me you're
Kenny Fleming's sister.

238
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,239
- [Charlene] This is a tip?
- [man] Yeah, that's my tip.

239
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,241
- You know what the bell says
about this tip? - [bell clanking]

240
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,410
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.

241
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,914
- Comes in here every day,
gives me shitty tips. - [man] Fuck that.

242
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,415
Yeah, fuck you, too.

243
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,919
- [man] Forget it, boys...
- You pave streets, right?

244
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,921
Yeah, I do.
And I'm a fighter.

245
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,056
Oh, yeah, I heard you
were a stepping-stone.

246
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:50,562
- No, I'm no stepping-stone.
- You're the guy they use,

247
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,064
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

248
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,066
Oh, I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

249
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,152
The next fight's
gonna show who I am.

250
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:59,654
[chuckles] Yeah, and he's
gonna lose that one, too.

251
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:02,657
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

252
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:05,193
So move that sugar ass
and get my... [grunts]

253
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:07,695
- [crowd gasping]
- You be nice. OK?

254
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,197
Be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

255
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,534
Hey, don't hurt your hands.
We got a fight next week.

256
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,953
- Besides, you wipe your ass with that one.
- [grunting]

257
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,038
Don't lean up, or I'm gonna
hit you in the cocksucker.

258
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,124
- He's gonna beat Saoul Mamby, say it!
- Yeah, he's gonna beat him!

259
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,710
- [man grunting]
- [Dicky] Right? Right? Hey!

260
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,964
- [grunting] Right.
- That's right!

261
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,348
I'm gonna take your drink,
as well. I'm taking his drink.

262
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:29,350
Hey, this guy's gonna
be champion.

263
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:31,352
He's a great guy.
He's a great fighter.

264
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:33,805
You can't go wrong.
Thanks for the drink.

265
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,274
Those cameras are makin'
a movie about him.

266
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,776
He knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO,

267
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,278
that's why they're following
him around with the camera.

268
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,280
And now they're making
a movie about his comeback.

269
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,283
Yeah, everybody's talking about
it. But who are you fightin'?

270
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,785
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

271
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:51,289
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

272
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,324
Where did they
find a guy like that?

273
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,326
He's no joke.
Former world champ.

274
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,328
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

275
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,831
- I match up good with him though.
- Yeah?

276
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,833
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

277
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,836
Well, I got lighter, you know?
I have a reputation for brawlin',

278
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,338
but I'm not gonna brawl with him.
I'm gonna try and out-box him.

279
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,340
- And there's a difference?
- Yeah, you know.

280
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,342
Brawlin', you slug it out.
I hit you, you hit me.

281
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,844
Boxing's a chess game,
you know?

282
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:15,430
I pick my punches
to take him down.

283
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,265
And go head, body, head, body.

284
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,318
What is "head, body,
head, body"?

285
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,853
Well, I hit him
in the head,

286
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,355
and then his hand's gonna
go up to protect himself,

287
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,857
so it opens up his body, and
then when I hit him in the body,

288
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,860
the hand moves back down,
I go back up to the head,

289
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,862
hand goes back up,
hit him in the body.

290
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,331
People who don't know fighting
think you can do a lot of damage

291
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:35,199
hitting somebody in the head,
but you do more

292
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,702
hitting 'em in the body.

293
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,705
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

294
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,592
Are you married?

295
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,094
No. Would I ask you out
if I was married?

296
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,096
- What kind of guy do you think I am?
- Happens all the time.

fuckin' fight him?

430

fight him. He's fat.

All right. I knocked out
Joey Ferrell, OK?

434
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,901
But the guy is a middleweight.
I'm a welterweight.

it, right? He can do anything.

443
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,091
Hey, Ray. Ray, Ray, Ray.

444
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:42,176
Hey, Ray! Sugar Ray! Over here!

445
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:45,930
Dicky. Come on,
look at the size of that guy.

446
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,299
- [Dicky] Holy shit.
- [Micky] Yeah, holy shit.

447
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
[O'Keefe] That guy's
no welterweight.

448
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:52,103
All right, Mick.
We'll have to run

449
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,138
the first few rounds,
tire him out.

450
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,606
He did not just get off
the fuckin' couch.

451
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,858
If he did,
I'm gonna buy a couch like that.

452
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:00,144
[Dicky] I don't care
who that guy is...

453
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,530
Look at me.
You're Micky Ward.

454
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,532
You're Micky Ward.

455
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,318
- [bell dings]
- [crowd cheering]

456
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,788
[announcer] Micky Ward, fighting a
last-minute replacement from Philadelphia.

457
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,624
Ward, thrown around
by a much bigger man!

458
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,827
- Punches, smashing Ward back!
- Jab!

459
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,496
- [grunting]
- Now it's big Mike...

460
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,049
- [crowd clamoring]
- Ward goes down! Ward goes down!

461
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,002
- Come on! Come on!
- ...four, five...

462
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,838
- [cackling]
- ...six...

463
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,141
Micky Ward's a fuckin' bum!
Get rid of this dude!

464
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,394
- Shut up!
- Motherfucker!

465
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,346
[announcer] Mungin didn't even
know he'd be fighting today.

466
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,598
- [clamoring]
- Hey, you, back off!

467
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,353
- Aah!
- Come on! No, no, no, Mick!

468
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,021
[bell dings]

469
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:45,823
[announcer] Ward,
a respected fighter.

470
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,275
You hope this mismatch
doesn't hurt his confidence.

471
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:52,613
- [woman 1] You're a loser!
- [woman 2] You're a loser!

472
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:56,417
[jeering, whistling]

473
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:02,706
- [dings]
- [crowd jeering]

474
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,044
[grunting]

475
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:15,269
- [bell dings]
-[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

476
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,771
before we get started, a lot
of people have been asking

477
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:19,774
about the big night
of boxing on November 4.

478
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:22,726
Three world championship
bouts...

479
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:26,030
- [Dicky] Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!
- [indistinct chatter]

480
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,451
- Hey! [chuckling]
- Dicky. How you doin', man?

481
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,953
- How are ya?
- All right, man.

482
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:36,457
He's 165 pounds.
ESPN screwed us. You know?

483
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,042
The guy was huge.

484
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,328
Hey. You know, I, uh...
I knocked Ray down.

485
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:44,081
I look like shit,
but I knocked Ray down.

486
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,083
[chuckling] Hey, let me buy
you guys a drink. All right?

487
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,751
- Want a cold one?
- No, no, no.

488
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:51,055
I got to leave. I got a plane
to catch. Next time, right?

489
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,308
Hey, Ray, wait, wait. HBO's
makin' a movie on me. You know?

490
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:57,011
Uh... Can I call ya?

491
00:24:57,012 --> 00:25:00,181
I'm gonna get a fight, and I just like
ya to be there for old time's sakes.

492
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:03,567
- You commentate or something.
- What's the movie about?

493
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,853
My comeback. Right?

494
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:08,939
- Call me. Love you, brother.
- I'll call ya.

495
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,108
You don't be a stranger!
[chuckling]

496
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,110
He's funny, "What's
the movie about?"

497
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,613
- [Alice laughs]
- What's that?

498
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,114
[man] You can do better. You're
too good a boxer, I've watched you.

499
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,533
- Are you going to the hospital?
- What is that?

500
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:20,918
They said I need
get stitches.

501
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,920
Mick, nobody's
got heart like you.

502
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,873
You're a very talented fighter, but
you're not getting the right fights.

503
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:27,758
It's killing
your chances.

504
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,177
- What's he talking to Mike Toma for?
- [Alice] I don't know, Dick.

505
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:32,596
I want to give you a real shot.
I want you to come with me.

506
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,598
I want to pay you
to train with my guys.

507
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,600
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

508
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,803
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

509
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,805
What about my brother?

510
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,358
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

511
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:47,862
You owe it to yourself
to come to Vegas.

512
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:50,364
Come on, Mick, what
has Dicky done for you?

513
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:53,367
He got you into fights, he lets
you get beat, like you did tonight.

514
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:54,869
You shouldn't have been
in that fight.

515
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,371
Eighteen pounds,
think of it that way.

516
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:59,373
You should've given it up.

517
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:03,160
- [lively chatter] - [George] Sit down
in the car there. Come on, you.

518
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,497
- Sit the hell down. - [Alice] Just a little
more Scotch for Mama.

519
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,883
There you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back.

520
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:11,886
- Will ya, ya old broad ya, huh?
- Oh, my God.

521
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:15,890
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray,
he's a beautiful man, isn't he?

522
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:18,893
[Dicky] He didn't recognize me straight
away. You seen the way he was looking at me?

523
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:23,147
[laughing] He's a good guy.
I like him, I like him.

524
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,599
[Dicky] I seen him on ringside, he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

525
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:28,569
He's all about family, that guy.
Loves to see a family stick together.

526
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:33,357
[Alice] Mick, what'd Mike Toma
want with you last night, huh?

527
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,242
- He wants to train me in Vegas.
- [Alice] What?

528
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:37,745
[Dicky] You can't trust that guy,
Micky. He ain't family, you know?

529
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,246
You don't know him.

530
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:42,750
He say anything about me?
Did he say I could come?

531
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:46,503
- He didn't mention you.
- Oh.

532
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,006
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without your brother, huh?

533
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,508
That guy just wants to use you
like a piece of toilet paper.

534
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,178
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

535
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,679
I know, that's what I told him.

536
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,681
- [Alice] You told him that, right?
- Yeah, I told him.

537
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,184
I said that I needed to
be with my family in Lowell.

538
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,186
[Alice] That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

539
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,688
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're gonna call him, baby.

540
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,975
- [Dicky] That's right.
- [Alice] You guys can spar a little, right?

541
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:09,777
- [overlapping chatter]
- Where are they?

542
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:12,112
- There's my champ!
- [woman] Daddy's home!

543
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:14,448
Daddy's home!
Daddy's home! Ah!

544
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:16,951
- Give him a big hug.
- I love you!

545
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:19,036
- [all chattering]
- Thank you.

546
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,038
Your face hurting you,
sweetheart?

547
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,042
No? 'Cause it's killing me.
[chuckling] Come on.

548
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,044
[Little Dicky] Did Uncle
Micky win the fight?

549
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,747
No, Micky didn't win
this time. Not this time.

550
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:33,584
Hey, Mick, you take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

551
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,886
Cheer up. We'll get
you another fight.

552
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,888
I don't know, Ma. I don't
think I wanna do this no more.

553
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,890
- [Dicky] Huh?
- What don't you wanna do no more?

554
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,225
Just, I don't wanna
do it anymore.

555
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:45,729
- What are you...?
- Hey, Mick, ESPN screwed us.

556
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,984
All right? They owe us. We'll
get another fight. You'll heal up.

557
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:52,653
- It's gonna be OK.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

558
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:55,022
They owe us big-time,
sweetheart.

559
00:27:55,023 --> 00:27:56,440
Maybe they'll even
do Dicky's comeback fight.

560
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,942
- What do you think, huh?
- [sighing]

561
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,445
Oh, come on, cheer up. You take
a little soak when you get home,

562
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,447
have a day or two
to think about it.

563
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,415
I'll find you
a better fight.

564
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,450
A much better fight.
I'm gonna talk to them.

565
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,919
- For Chrissakes, Alice.
- What?

566
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,921
He's been through the ringer.
Leave him alone, will ya?

567
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,424
- What are you talking about? - Let him get
some time to himself. He just got finished.

568
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,926
- What's your fuckin' problem?
- Come on.

569
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,594
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not gonna come in?

570
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,096
[George]
No, he's not coming in.

571
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,931
He needs to get back
and get some rest.

572
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,800
- [overlapping chatter]
- [George] Come on, let's go inside.

573
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,803
- [chatter continues] - [Alice] No. He's
gonna go rest. He's all grumpy.

574
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,305
[George] He's beat up, he's
a little embarrassed, I think.

575
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:31,308
- [woman] Look at him. Have you
even seen him? - [voices fading]

576
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:37,614
[TV plays indistinctly]

577
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,632
[no audible dialogue]

578
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,609
[knocking at door]

579
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:27,614
[knocking louder]

580
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:30,117
[Micky] Who is it?

581
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:32,035
[knocking continues]

582
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:40,594
[knocking]

583
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:50,220
[muttering quietly]

584
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,474
I saw the shade move.

585
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:54,775
Micky, the shade
is still moving.

586
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,312
I saw you come to the window,
I know you're in there.

587
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:01,231
Least you can do is open up
this door and tell me to my face

588
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,817
why you didn't call me
yesterday.

589
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:11,825
Why'd you stand me up
last night?

590
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:15,329
I started to call. I was gonna
call, but... I just couldn't.

591
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,331
'Cause you lost the fight?

592
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:19,833
Maybe, yeah.
'Cause I lost the fight.

593
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,835
How'd you know
my house, anyway?

594
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:23,837
I asked my brother.

595
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,840
Your thing's coming off.

596
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:28,842
I mean your other thing.

597
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:32,846
You got any tape?

598
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:43,190
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

599
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:47,194
I didn't get to fight
the black Jewish guy.

600
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:50,697
You didn't get
to go head, body, head?

601
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,699
Saoul Mamby got the flu.

602
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,701
Guy who took his place
had 20 pounds on me.

603
00:30:54,702 --> 00:30:57,704
I never should've
fought him.

604
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:02,626
- Why did you?
- Nobody would've got paid.

605
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,596
Everybody said
I could've beat him.

606
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,098
Who's everybody?

607
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,101
My mother, my brother.

608
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:16,523
So are you gonna take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

609
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:34,825

- Hey.
- Hey.

613
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,891
- You look great.
- Thank you.

614
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:52,893
Got a nice house, too.

615
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:55,395
It's an apartment building.
There's five of 'em in there.

616
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:56,847
One of my old roommates
lives in one.

617
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:58,315
Roommate?
What, were you in the Army?

618
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,851
- College.
- College. Wow.

619
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,904
Yeah, a lot of good it
did me. I work in a bar.

620
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:06,406
Well, you seem to enjoy it.
You're very popular down there.

621
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:08,909
[scoff] Yeah, popular.
I gotta get out of there.

622
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,912
If I don't drink while I'm
working, I'll fuckin' kill myself.

623
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:15,415
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

624
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,416
Full boat's
a scholarship, right?

625
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,919
- Yeah.
- For what?

626
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,372
- I was a high jumper.
- High jumper? You gotta be kidding me.

627
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:25,425
Fuck you. I was good. I was New
England champ. I cleared 5'8".

628
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:28,929
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

629
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,432
- You? [chuckling]
- Ha.

630
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:47,648
What are we doing
in Richie Rich Lexington?

631
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,149
You come to this
theater a lot?

632
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,151
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They got good movies here.

633
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:54,154
- Yeah, like what?
-Belli Epi-que.

634
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:58,158
I think it's Belle Epic.
It's "epic. "Belle Epic.

635
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,545
Belle Epoque.
The New York Times loved it.

636
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,547
Well, I never heard of it.

637
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,549
Where'd you hear about it?
The New York Times?

638
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,551
No, a guy from work.

639
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,170
[man] And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

640
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:12,139
Oh, cool.

641
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:16,843

Thank you.

645
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,785
That's the movie
you wanted to see?

646
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,287
There wasn't even
any good sex in it.

647
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,789
Had to read
the whole fuckin' movie.

648
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,291
Fuckin' subtitled.

649
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,794
And some guy from a road
crew recommended it to you?

650
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,296
A fuckin' subtitled movie?

651
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:56,299
[chuckles]
What's going on, huh?

652
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,302
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

653
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,305
I don't have a girlfriend,
all right?

654
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,058
I... I like you.

655
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:08,061
I came here 'cause I don't
wanna show my face in Lowell.

656
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:10,564
I told everybody I was gonna win
that fight and get back on track.

657
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:13,567
I told my daughter I was gonna get a
bigger apartment so she can move in.

658
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,569
You don't think
I wanted to call you?

659
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,571
I was embarrassed. I mean...

660
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:21,074
I'm sick of being a fuckin'
disappointment. I...

661
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,081
You really think your
family's looking out for you?

662
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:33,220
Don't say that
about my family.

663
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:36,223
What else can I say
after what you told me?

664
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:39,726
I mean, look at your face.

665
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:42,229
Look at you.

666
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:09,339
[Alice] Bullshit, Lou.
I'm not gonna stop callin'

667
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,843
till you make this right
and give us a fight that's fair.

668
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,345
My boy could've
got killed last time.

[TV plays indistinctly]

670

Yeah, like what?

671
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:23,353
Just don't tell me he just
got off the fuckin' couch.

672
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,641
Mm-hm.

673
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:30,393
He's coming off a loss?

674
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:33,396
Sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

675
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,899
We got a great
opportunity here.

676
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:37,901
We gotta go find Micky.

677
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:41,121
Nobody's seen him
for like three weeks.

678

Jesus.

679
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,127
Used to be Dicky we couldn't
find, now it's both of them?

680
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:49,129
[Cindy] Ma, I think he's
with that girl from the bar.

681
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,132
- What girl?
- It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.

682
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:54,217
That's who he's with.
That girl from the bar.

George was all fuckin' eager
for them to get together.

[Phyllis] I heard
she's into three-ways.

[Sherri] Yeah,
with other girls.

686
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,843

What are you talking about?

Wild.

689

She acts all fuckin' superior
'cause she went to college.

690
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,436
You girls just go
find your brother, Micky.

691

Tell him we've got important
business to discuss.

Can we just sit down

you'd be more excited.

It's a good fight, good money.

going the way they've been going.

I know that going to Vegas and
gettin' paid to train year-round

775
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,753

disrespects me.

no disrespect, OK?

787

to train year-round,

That's all she's talking about.

[man on TV]
Dicky... put Lowell on the map.

1043
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,342
He knocked
Sugar Ray Leonard down.

1044
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:28,844
Yeah, he knocked him down,

1045
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:31,847
but I don't think
it was a knockdown.

1046
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,633
- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.

1047
00:57:34,634 --> 00:57:37,269
- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.

1048
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:39,354
- Oh... and you're from Lowell.
- Yeah, come on.

1049
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:42,858
- That's a fuckin' lie!
-They said he's in trouble with drugs.

1050
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,861
What is this? Are you talking
shit about the family?

1051
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:49,364
- Oh, no, no, no...
- I heard you say "Dicky, Micky..."

1052
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,116
We're not like that. This is
not what Lowell is all about.

1053
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:53,118
I thought he could
make a comeback

1054
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,620
and make us proud,
but he didn't.

1055
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,121
I don't know what
Dicky was thinking.

1056
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:58,323
[woman 1] Very disappointing,
very disgusting.

Make sure Kasie's
not watching HBO?

Actually, we're watching it

-Who you are.

you talking about?

the truth, Mick.

You know, you feel young,

01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:16,611
- Who came up with that? Fatty fuck O'Keefe?
- Fuck you, Dicky.

1333
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:19,697
You gotta run against this guy.
Let him punch himself out.

1334
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:22,200
Take him to the body,
right? Get inside.

1335
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:25,169
Switch stances like you're gonna
work his right, hit him on the left.

1336
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:26,671
You ain't me. All right?
You can't be me.

1337
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,257
- Careful. Switch outside...
- You had a hard enough time

1338
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:30,758
being you when you
had your fuckin' chance,

1339
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,260
and that's
why you're in here.

1340
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:34,178
I'll fight
Sanchez the way I fight.

1341
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:38,182
I'm talking about the
way you fight, you moron!

1342
01:15:38,183 --> 01:15:41,936
Yeah, you know I'm right!
He knows I'm right. All right.

1343
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:46,941
-[audience cheering]
- He knows I'm right.

1344
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:49,727
[up-tempo intro music playing]

1345
01:15:49,728 --> 01:15:50,728
[announcer 1] Ward's record:

1346
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:54,899
29 wins, seven losses
so far, 20 KOs.

1347
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,369
He's been a little better since
he refocused himself on the sport,

1348
01:15:58,370 --> 01:16:00,371
as JB pointed out.

1349
01:16:05,577 --> 01:16:08,212
Now, here's Ward's opponent,
Alfonso Sanchez,

1350
01:16:08,714 --> 01:16:10,631
out of Tijuana, Mexico.

1351
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:15,469
You see the record: 16 wins,
15 KOs, eight first-round KOs.

1352
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,471
[announcer 2] There's Mike
Toma, the promoter of the fight,

1353
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:19,423
who has a lot invested
in Sanchez.

1354
01:16:19,424 --> 01:16:22,677
And he says that Sanchez is
one of the most talented

1355
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:25,596
young prospects
in the sport of boxing.

1356
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,518
- [bell dings]
- [crowd clamoring]

1357
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:39,577
[announcer 1] This is really one of
the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.

1358
01:16:40,078 --> 01:16:42,580
- Get out of the corner!
- Micky Ward is 31 years old,

1359
01:16:42,581 --> 01:16:45,950
he's here because he needs the
money, he's taking a beating...

1360
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:49,754
[announcer 3] And my point is that he doesn't
really have to sit here and take this beating.

1361
01:16:49,755 --> 01:16:52,006
- He can do something about it.
- [announcer 2] Which is what?

1362
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,007
Have his corner throw
in the towel?

1363
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,042
- [announcer 3] Or fight back.
- Get back.

1364
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,762
[crowd booing, jeering]

1365
01:16:57,763 --> 01:16:58,679
[announcer 1]
You can see his power.

1366
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,182
Every time he hits
Ward, he backs him up.

1367
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,935
- [announcer 2] How about taking
points away from him? - [booing]

1368
01:17:03,936 --> 01:17:06,020
[announcer 1] Larry, unless
the referee does, you can't.

1369
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,022
[announcer 3] The referee should
just go ahead and stop this fight.

1370
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:11,442
He knows that Micky doesn't want
to be here. I wouldn't even make...

1371
01:17:11,443 --> 01:17:13,778
He's fightin' scared, Dick.

1372
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:15,980
Runnin' away, not hittin' back.

1373
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:19,367
[Alice]
Oh, Jesus. He's gonna get hurt.

1374
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,869
Doing that same old shit.

1375
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,322
They never seen such
an embarrassing performance.

1376
01:17:24,323 --> 01:17:26,123
He's doing what I told him, Ma.
He's doing what I told him.

1377
01:17:26,124 --> 01:17:27,992
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

1378
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:31,329
- [announcer 1] Micky Ward, showing
nothing but respect. - [bell dinging]

1379
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:33,164
What are you runnin' around for?
Stop running around!

1380
01:17:33,165 --> 01:17:36,417
Shut the fuck up, Sal!
Shut the fuck up!

1381
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,753
I don't know what you're doing,
Micky. Want to fuckin' tell me?

1382
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:40,171
'Cause I don't know
what you're doing.

1383
01:17:40,172 --> 01:17:42,640
We have lost all five rounds,
is that what you want?

1384
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,309
[announcer 1] Dreadful. This
is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1385
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:47,762
You gotta show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm gonna stop the fight.

1386
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,263
Now they're gonna
stop the fight, Micky.

1387
01:17:49,481 --> 01:17:51,315
He's gotta go inside, Ma.

1388
01:17:51,316 --> 01:17:53,734
He's gotta take it to the body.
He's gotta.

1389
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:56,187
- [Charlene] Come on, get your punches up...
- Don't stop the fight.

1390
01:17:56,188 --> 01:17:59,440
- They're gonna stop this fight.
- Then you gotta do something, baby.

1391
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:03,244
[O'Keefe] That's not what we talked about,
Micky. We had a plan and you're not doing it.

1392
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,246
- Now, let's go.
- [bell dinging]

1393
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:07,748
[announcer 1] All right, Micky.
You've lost the first five rounds.

1394
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:09,950
What's the next
strategy gonna be?

1395
01:18:10,202 --> 01:18:13,621
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

1396
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:17,041
A couple of the left hooks landed
flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1397
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:19,093
- Ward tying Sanchez up.
- [indistinct]

1398
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:22,463
- Very curious performance by Micky Ward.
- Come on, Micky, come on!

1399
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:27,885
[announcer 3] Ward seems... trying to land
one big shot to change Sanchez's mind...

1400
01:18:27,886 --> 01:18:29,887
[announcer 1]
And he's beginning to open up.

1401
01:18:29,888 --> 01:18:32,556
Taking advantage of more and more
opportunities to get close to Ward

1402
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:34,108
and throw against a fighter...

1403
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:35,643
- [bell dinging]
- [referee] Time!

1404
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:38,062
...who's not defending
himself by punching.

1405
01:18:38,063 --> 01:18:41,315
[announcer 3] Sanchez is gonna
try to end this fight.

1406
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,738
[bell dings]

1407
01:18:47,739 --> 01:18:50,041
- What are you doing? Come on!
- That's it.

1408
01:18:50,042 --> 01:18:52,710
Good boy!

1409
01:18:52,711 --> 01:18:55,880
- [announcer 1] He's down on an uppercut!
- [crowd clamoring]

1410
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,969
- Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.
- ...three, four, five...

1411
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:05,473
[announcer 2] And right after Ward
threw a pretty good right hand.

1412
01:19:06,058 --> 01:19:08,559
Mick, you all right?
Come to me. Come to me.

1413
01:19:09,061 --> 01:19:10,928
[announcer 2] This is a fight
that should be stopped.

1414
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:15,516
- Come on, head, body, head.
- Ugh.

1415
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,102
[announcer 1]
This is not professional.

1416
01:19:18,103 --> 01:19:19,937
[announcer 3]
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1417
01:19:19,938 --> 01:19:23,240
- Punch him! You gotta punch! - Someone
should pay me to watch this. [chuckling]

1418
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:27,611
Come on, man!
Head, body, head!

1419
01:19:27,612 --> 01:19:29,196
[announcer 3] That was
a good body shot by Ward.

1420
01:19:29,581 --> 01:19:31,832
[announcer 1] That was good.
Maybe it'll turn him around.

1421
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,201
[announcer 3]
Maybe. I'm talking about if...

1422
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:38,622
- [crowd screaming] - [announcer 1] Sanchez
drops like he's shot! Oh, my God!

1423
01:19:38,623 --> 01:19:42,593
The most unlikely
knockout you have ever seen.

1424
01:19:43,095 --> 01:19:45,963
[announcer 2] That was a kidney
shot, the kind of kidney shot...

1425
01:19:45,964 --> 01:19:49,300
- ...nine, ten!
- [bell dinging]

1426
01:19:49,301 --> 01:19:52,853
- [cheering] - [announcer 1] I still
don't believe what I just saw.

1427
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:57,308
[cheering]

1428
01:19:57,309 --> 01:19:58,976
Oh, Micky won!

1429
01:20:01,313 --> 01:20:03,731
[announcer 1] Now, did Micky
Ward just make idiots of us all

1430
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:06,317
with a spectacular piece
of strategy?

1431
01:20:06,318 --> 01:20:07,818
Take another look. Amazing.

1432
01:20:07,819 --> 01:20:10,321
A brilliant win in the career of
Micky Ward out of Lowell, Mass.

1433
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:13,824
Unbelievable defeat
at the hands of Micky Ward,

1434
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:18,712
who had all but given away the
first half-dozen rounds of the bout.

1435
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,714
[announcer 3] I think what
Micky did was he recognized

1436
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:22,716
that he'd hurt the guy
with the body shot.

1437
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:25,719
Micky's a better fighter than that to
not be runnin' from that guy like that.

1438
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,172
[announcer 1]
Theater of the unexpected.

1439
01:20:28,173 --> 01:20:30,090
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

1440
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,092
Never give up in this game,
right? Never give up.

1441
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:34,678
- [laughing]
- You can't make it up, folks.

1442
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:37,681
[announcer 3] You hear what he said? He
said, "You can't give up in this game."

1443
01:20:37,682 --> 01:20:41,268
[announcer 2] Well, maybe Micky Ward
heard me say you should stop this fight

1444
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,270
and he went out and stopped it.

1445
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:45,940
- Right there. Right there.
- Yeah! [laughing] I can't believe it.

1446
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:49,443
I'm lookin' over, and I'm thinkin'
to myself like they were thinkin':

1447
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:50,911
This thing is over.

1448
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:52,913
But I tell you what, if you
looked at the commentators,

1449
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:55,499
they started to take their headsets
off before he was even counted out.

1450
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:57,501
They just wanted
to get out of there.

1451
01:20:57,502 --> 01:21:00,004
Mick, Mick.
I just spoke to Mike Toma.

1452
01:21:00,005 --> 01:21:02,423
- He told me something very interesting.
- Holy shit, what?

1453
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:05,009
He just told me,
had Sanchez won tonight,

1454
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,961
he would've gotten
the title shot.

1455
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:10,014
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

1456
01:21:10,015 --> 01:21:14,518
- A title shot. Mick gets the shot.
- Micky gets the shot!

1457
01:21:14,519 --> 01:21:17,521
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you sure about that?

1458
01:21:18,023 --> 01:21:21,725
I just spoke to the guy. Mike! Come
here, Mike. Look, tell these guys.

1459
01:21:21,726 --> 01:21:23,694
- Hey, Mike Toma. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1460
01:21:23,695 --> 01:21:26,697
You're not a stepping-stone anymore.
I always knew you had the talent.

1461
01:21:26,698 --> 01:21:29,817
That was a hell of a strategy, wearing
him down and taking it to the body.

1462
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:32,820
Thirty years in the business, I'd
never seen a knockout like that.

1463
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,121
Larry Merchant was
writing your obituary,

1464
01:21:34,706 --> 01:21:36,040
and Sanchez drops
like he's shot with a gun.

1465
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,491
- [all laugh]
- Where'd you get that?

1466
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:38,993
That's the first thing
my brother taught me.

1467
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:40,995
Tap 'em to the head,
ding 'em to the body.

1468
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:42,963
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

1469
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:45,799
- You ready for a title shot?
- I ain't gettin' no younger.

1470
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,303
- [excited chattering]
- Thanks, Mr. Toma. Thank you.

1471
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:51,805
- He's ready. You're ready, aren't ya?
- [excited chatter]

1472
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:54,808
[Sal] Shea Neary in London
for the title.

1473
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:56,810
[George] Are you kidding,
we got some celebrating to do.

1474
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:58,812
- [Mike] Yeah, I think so.
- [George] Thank you so much.

1475
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:01,315
- You're gonna have a great champ in my boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Toma.

1476
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:05,319
- [all chattering, chuckling] - [Sal] It's
what your brother would've always wanted.

1477
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,822
- He's not even gonna be there.
- [chatter continues indistinctly]

1478
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:29,043
[buzzing]

1479
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:36,550
- Hey! [laughing]
- Daddy!

1480
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,552
- Come here, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

1481
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:43,390
[laughing] Good to see you! Ah!

1482
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:47,811
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Ah, yeah!

1483
01:22:47,812 --> 01:22:50,314
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Ma.

1484
01:22:50,315 --> 01:22:55,369
Oh, you look so good.
Oh, my God.

1485
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:05,296
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

1486
01:23:05,297 --> 01:23:09,550
- [chuckling] - I got new teeth.
Everything. How you think I look?

1487
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,052
- [Little Dicky] Good.
- [Dicky] Yeah?

1488
01:23:19,844 --> 01:23:22,229
[indistinct chatter]

1489
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,517
- [punching sounds]
- Cake and more cake.

1490
01:23:27,018 --> 01:23:29,520
- Ice cream? Huh?
- Ice cream and cake.

1491
01:23:29,521 --> 01:23:32,022
Ice cream and cake
and cake. Right?

1492
01:23:32,524 --> 01:23:35,609
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake...

1493
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:38,028
[Dicky] Quacka!

1494
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:43,917
Ma.

1495
01:23:56,681 --> 01:24:00,517
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah. [chuckles]

1496
01:24:04,222 --> 01:24:06,223
Hey, Georgie. What, they
let you outta the house now?

1497
01:24:06,224 --> 01:24:09,193
- [George chuckles] Yeah.
- Lettin' him outta the house, Ma?

1498
01:24:09,194 --> 01:24:11,528
[George] Hey, look, I want
you to meet Sal Lonano.

1499
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:20,571
How you doing, Dicky?

1500
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:23,907
Let's spar. Huh?

1501
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,746
[indistinct]

1502
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:33,634
Hey, Charlene.

1503
01:24:34,586 --> 01:24:37,471
[running footsteps]

1504
01:24:58,743 --> 01:25:00,577
[giggling] Welcome back!

1505
01:25:00,578 --> 01:25:03,580
Shh! It's supposed to be
a surprise. You're late.

1506
01:25:03,948 --> 01:25:06,366
- [Micky] Hey.
- Hey.

1507
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:10,337
Mick, I can't even tell you, being in
this smelly-ass locker room. You know?

1508
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:12,873
Being back with you,
this is what got me through.

1509
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:18,512
- You look good. Your eyes are clear.
- Yeah. You know...

1510
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:21,432
...Alice says prison might've
been the best thing for me.

1511
01:25:21,433 --> 01:25:25,018
Got me clean.
Got me clear. Up here.

1512
01:25:25,603 --> 01:25:28,188
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1513
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:33,777
- I gotta talk to you about something.
- Yeah.

1514
01:25:33,778 --> 01:25:37,281
Look at this locker.
The old locker. Huh?

1515
01:25:37,282 --> 01:25:39,783
I love it. Fuckin' love it.
[kisses, chuckles]

1516
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:44,321
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

1517
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,881
Huh?

1518
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:58,385
I had to. After everything
that happened, I'm sorry.

1519
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:05,259
You stickin' to that?

1520
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:11,231
I'm glad you're back.
You look good.

1521
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:14,735
I don't know what else to say.

1522
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:24,161
- Mick, you fuckin' kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1523
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:30,784
- [stammering] Oh, hey, Mick.
- Come on, come on!

1524
01:26:31,169 --> 01:26:36,006
You gotta... Ma. You gotta
do this at home. Please?

1525
01:26:36,007 --> 01:26:40,043
- What are you talkin' about?
What's the matter? - Mom, please?

1526
01:26:40,044 --> 01:26:42,546
- All right, girls. Let's pack it up.
- [overlapping chatter]

1527
01:26:42,547 --> 01:26:44,047
I know.
We'll see him at home.

1528
01:26:44,349 --> 01:26:45,549
[crashing]

1529
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,101
[locker door squeaking]

1530
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:08,789
- [sister 1] What the hell...?
- [Alice] Would you please pack it up?

1531
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:10,741
- [sister 2] Why?
- [Alice] Let's get it put away.

1532
01:27:10,742 --> 01:27:13,827
If that's what Micky wants,
we're gonna put it away.

1533
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:16,330
- There's your brother.
- [all] Dicky...

1534
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:19,800
- How ya doing?
- Micky?

1535
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:22,169
[hushed whispering]

1536
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:26,974
That's nice. That's nice.

1537
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:28,475
We've been working on it
for two weeks.

1538
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:29,977
Sherri, come on, stop it.

1539
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,979
- [sobbing]
- All right, girls, come on, let's go home.

1540
01:27:32,263 --> 01:27:34,598
It's not the time to do this,
obviously. Come on.

1541
01:27:34,599 --> 01:27:39,102
You stay here.
What the hell's going on?

1542
01:27:39,103 --> 01:27:41,605
- What's going on?
- We ain't gonna work together.

1543
01:27:42,574 --> 01:27:44,575
He don't want me
to work with him.

1544
01:27:44,576 --> 01:27:46,860
What're you talking about?

1545
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:48,996
[Alice] That's not right.

1546
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:52,666
Micky never would've won
Sanchez without Dicky.

1547
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,952
That's fuckin' bullshit!
Take it back!

1548
01:27:54,953 --> 01:27:57,371
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you
fuckin' talk to my mother that way.

1549
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:58,372
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1550
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:00,624
Take 'em home.

1551
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:03,844
Why don't you ask Micky?

1552
01:28:04,929 --> 01:28:07,014
If we're gonna train,
they gotta go.

1553
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:09,516
They gotta go,
Mick, come on.

1554
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:13,687
Ask him, George. Ask him if he would've
won Sanchez without his brother?

1555
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:15,555
[Dicky] Hey, take him
outside, all right?

1556
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:20,944
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

1557
01:28:20,945 --> 01:28:24,815
- [Charlene] How can you say that
to O'Keefe? - [Micky] Because it's true.

1558
01:28:24,816 --> 01:28:26,700
I went with that game plan,
it wasn't working.

1559
01:28:26,701 --> 01:28:28,902
So I went back to what
I learned with Dicky.

1560
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:32,039
And I wouldn't have won without
you, either, O'Keefe, OK?

1561
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,490
I mean, you know that.

1562
01:28:33,491 --> 01:28:35,459
We worked hard.
You got me ready.

1563
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,911
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

1564
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:41,581
and from Sal and
your father and from me.

1565
01:28:43,001 --> 01:28:45,469
- Dicky's a junk bag.
- Hey.

1566
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:46,470
He's a junk bag!

1567
01:28:46,471 --> 01:28:47,921
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Fuck you.

1568
01:28:48,339 --> 01:28:49,840
- I'm eight months sober.
- Oh, yeah,

1569
01:28:49,841 --> 01:28:51,842
and I'm sure you're gonna need
something now that you're out.

1570
01:28:51,843 --> 01:28:53,343
"Oh, my back. Oh, my back."

1571
01:28:53,344 --> 01:28:56,346
- Fuck you always picking on me for?
- No, fuck you!

1572
01:28:56,347 --> 01:28:58,265
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

1573
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:01,068
One day at a fucking time, right,
O'Keefe? You know what I mean?

1574
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,436
What, it's all right
for him to be here?

1575
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:04,938
Why am I the fuckin' problem?
I'm his blood, I'm his family!

1576
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,274
- You are the problem!
- I'm the one fighting, OK?

1577
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:09,609
Not you, not you, and not you.

1578
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,030
- I know what I need.
- [Charlene] And you need Dicky?

1579
01:29:13,031 --> 01:29:15,615
I want Dicky back.

1580
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:18,335
And I want you, Charlene.
And I want O'Keefe.

1581
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,787
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

1582
01:29:22,707 --> 01:29:24,207
It's not the deal we made, baby.

1583
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:26,543
[Sal] She's right, Micky.
That's not the deal.

1584
01:29:26,544 --> 01:29:30,213
It wasn't the deal. Come on,
you can't do this to us.

1585
01:29:30,214 --> 01:29:31,965
- You sound like them now.
- I sound like them now?

1586
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:34,051
- Yeah, you sound like them.
- You sound like them.

1587
01:29:34,052 --> 01:29:35,519
How could I do this to you?
"You can't do that to us.

1588
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,389
He can't do that to us."
You sound like them.

1589
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:41,274
You should fuckin' listen
to yourself.

1590
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:43,810
You sound like them and maybe
this is where you belong.

1591
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:45,362
That's the way
you love him?

1592
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:47,564
- Charlene!
- Come on!

1593
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:49,616
You wanted your
brother? Good luck.

1594
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:52,402
- [George] O'Keefe, come on.
- Mickey.

1595
01:29:52,403 --> 01:29:53,787
[George] Mickey.

1596
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,876
Come on, everything
happens for a reason.

1597
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:05,465
You know? Maybe it's for
the best. God has a plan.

1598
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:09,970
Wanna spar with your brother?

1599
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:18,645
Dick Eklund, pride of Lowell!

1600
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,815
[Alice] Watching
that for years, huh?

1601
01:30:24,602 --> 01:30:25,902
- [grunting]
- Micky, Micky!

1602
01:30:25,903 --> 01:30:28,021
[Alice] Whoa, hey!
What the hell are you doing?

1603
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:29,573
- [groaning]
- Micky!

1604
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:31,658
- Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
- [Alice] For crying out loud!

1605
01:30:31,943 --> 01:30:33,610
Take that baby out of here.

1606
01:30:33,611 --> 01:30:36,079
I told you take him away
ten minutes ago!

1607
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,499
Sweetheart, you all right?
You OK? Your back?

1608
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,953
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1609
01:30:42,954 --> 01:30:46,957
Can this be my fight,
Alice? Huh? Just once?

1610
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:50,460
Maybe just this one time
not for Dicky? Huh?

1611
01:30:50,461 --> 01:30:52,462
I know you think
he's coming back.

1612
01:30:52,463 --> 01:30:55,966
He's 40 years old and doesn't have a
tooth in his head that's his fuckin' own.

1613
01:30:55,967 --> 01:30:57,467
[Dicky] I'll go
fuckin' ten rounds.

1614
01:30:57,468 --> 01:30:59,469
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

1615
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:01,304
- What are you sayin', sweetheart?

gentlemen, 12 rounds of boxing

1766
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:07,934
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

1767
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:11,354
- [crowd cheering]
- [# Whitesnake: Here I Go Again]

1768
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:13,523
I can't see!

1769
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:18,277
[singing along]
# Here I go again on my own #

1770
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:23,783
# Goin' down the only road
I've ever known #

1771
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:30,540
# Like a drifter
I was born to walk alone #

1772
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:34,544
- Hey, fellas, let's go.
- #I made up my mind#

1773
01:40:34,545 --> 01:40:35,545
[booing, jeering]

1774
01:40:36,046 --> 01:40:41,100
# I ain't wasting
no more time #

1775
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:46,272
-[booing]
- # Here I go again on my own #

1776
01:40:46,774 --> 01:40:51,477
# Going down the only road
I've ever known #

1777
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:55,481
# Like a drifter I was born
to walk alone #

1778
01:40:55,482 --> 01:40:58,484
- Don't listen to 'em, Mick.
- Wow.

1779
01:40:58,485 --> 01:41:01,571
# I made up my mind #

1780
01:41:03,574 --> 01:41:07,076
# I ain't wasting
no more time... ##

1781
01:41:11,081 --> 01:41:12,915
[announcer 1] And there is Micky
Ward of Lowell, Massachusetts,

1782
01:41:12,916 --> 01:41:16,753
entering the ring. It's his first
fight outside the United States.

1783
01:41:16,754 --> 01:41:19,756
Micky Ward:
30 wins, seven losses.

1784
01:41:19,757 --> 01:41:24,260
He's gotten better
recently, 20 KOs.

1785
01:41:24,261 --> 01:41:27,764
And now Ward awaits his
opponent, Shea Neary.

1786
01:41:27,765 --> 01:41:31,768
Neary regards himself
as the European Arturo Gatti.

1787
01:41:32,269 --> 01:41:35,271
- [indistinct] - Meaning that he
is a head-on, high-contact fighter

1788
01:41:35,773 --> 01:41:39,242
- [bell dinging]
- who throws 70 punches per round.

1789
01:41:39,243 --> 01:41:41,694
- [wild applause]
- Neary's from Liverpool and should have

1790
01:41:41,695 --> 01:41:43,996
- a huge following here tonight.
- [up-tempo music plays]

1791
01:41:43,997 --> 01:41:45,782
[indistinct]

1792
01:41:45,783 --> 01:41:50,420
[announcer 2] Accompanied by
Paint the Town Red by The Mahones.

1793
01:41:50,421 --> 01:41:53,923
[announcer 1] Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

1794
01:41:53,924 --> 01:41:57,710
[announcer 2] He is a very tough
young man. Beyond dedicated.

1795
01:41:57,711 --> 01:42:01,130
Lives a Spartan existence.
And according to his promoters,

1796
01:42:01,632 --> 01:42:05,885
does nothing but eat,
drink, think, fantasize...

1797
01:42:06,303 --> 01:42:08,387
...dream of fighting.

1798
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:12,558
[announcer 1] Shea Neary has had 22
professional fights and won them all.

1799
01:42:12,559 --> 01:42:14,560
Seventeen KOs.

1800
01:42:24,738 --> 01:42:28,241
Come out when you hear the bell.
Don't piss about. Shake hands.

1801
01:42:28,742 --> 01:42:32,211
Both of ya... shake hands!

1802
01:42:32,212 --> 01:42:36,833
[announcer 2] As close as we just
saw them in the middle of the ring,

1803
01:42:36,834 --> 01:42:38,751
- forehead to forehead,
- Did you see that?

1804
01:42:38,752 --> 01:42:41,471
that's how close
we expect them to be

1805
01:42:41,472 --> 01:42:45,057
for as long
as this fight goes on.

1806
01:42:45,058 --> 01:42:47,093
[announcer 3]
Ward is a long ways from home.

1807
01:42:47,094 --> 01:42:48,594
Don't coast
in a foreign country.

1808
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:50,346
[announcer 1] Well,
the big challenge for Ward

1809
01:42:50,347 --> 01:42:53,900
is to get off to a faster start
than is customary for him.

1810
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:57,320
Micky Ward, a notoriously
slow starter in big fights,

1811
01:42:57,688 --> 01:42:59,605
Shea Neary,
an ultra-fast starter.

1812
01:43:00,157 --> 01:43:02,158
- [bell dings] - And that's the
question that hovers over round one.

1813
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,160
- [audience cheering]
- Will Ward be ready for the fight?

1814
01:43:04,161 --> 01:43:07,330
Already, Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes!

1815
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:11,417
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

1816
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:14,704
- [announcer 2] Whoa! - [announcer 1] Neary
bangs Ward to the body.

1817
01:43:14,705 --> 01:43:18,508
- And a big uppercut by Neary.
- [announcer 3] Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1818
01:43:18,509 --> 01:43:20,927
- Come on, Micky!
- Keeps Ward off balance,

1819
01:43:20,928 --> 01:43:22,378
jabbing here and there.

1820
01:43:24,264 --> 01:43:26,015
[announcer 1] There's
a good left hook by Neary

1821
01:43:26,517 --> 01:43:28,684
as he stepped in on Ward.

1822
01:43:28,685 --> 01:43:30,970
Ward not able to deal
with him very well

1823
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:33,439
when Neary stands
at range like this.

1824
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:35,942
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

1825
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:39,478
[announcer 1] And a left hook
lands up top from Micky Ward.

1826
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:41,280
Neary digging his
own right hand to the body.

1827
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:43,866
They trade shots at close range.

1828
01:43:44,868 --> 01:43:47,370
Ward, he's trying
to match Neary blow for blow

1829
01:43:47,371 --> 01:43:48,871
and now Neary starts to come on

1830
01:43:49,239 --> 01:43:52,542
and take the last
30 seconds of the round...

1831
01:43:52,543 --> 01:43:54,076
- How about that?
- [bell dinging]

1832
01:43:54,077 --> 01:43:55,995
Break!

1833
01:43:55,996 --> 01:43:59,298
[announcer 2] Tremendous barrage in
the first minute. Just look at this.

1834
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:00,883
[announcer 3]
Unbelievable.

1835
01:44:00,884 --> 01:44:03,336
[announcer 1]
What a great round one!

1836
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:06,839
[announcer 2] Ward is gonna
have to pick up the tempo

1837
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:08,841
and beat him with
volumes of punching.

1838
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:12,895
-[chatter]
- [announcer 3] No doubt, Neary is a better boxer.

1839
01:44:12,896 --> 01:44:15,181
[indistinct]

1840
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:17,516
[announcer 2]
Four hard right hands...

1841
01:44:17,517 --> 01:44:19,986
...Neary has belted
in the last minute.

1842
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:23,489
[announcer 1] Quicker than Ward,
more assertive than Ward,

1843
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:25,491
surer of what he wants to do.

1844
01:44:25,492 --> 01:44:28,327
- They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring. - [bell dinging]

1845
01:44:28,328 --> 01:44:31,113
[announcer 3] Ward's gonna have to step it
up a little bit more than he is right now.

1846
01:44:31,498 --> 01:44:34,417
[announcer 1] Micky Ward's corner taking
a real deep look at what's going on now.

1847
01:44:34,418 --> 01:44:38,704
And his family at ringside well
aware he's stepping up in class.

1848
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:41,707
[announcer 3] Ward has fallen to the
pedal. He's gotta be more aggressive.

1849
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:43,793
He can't just try to wait
until everything is perfect.

1850
01:44:43,794 --> 01:44:47,380
[announcer 1] His dominance over Micky
Ward is increasing as the fight goes on

1851
01:44:47,381 --> 01:44:51,601
because his technical plan was the
right one and he's executing it.

1852
01:44:51,602 --> 01:44:55,938
[announcer 2] Punches
like these make it seem...

1853
01:44:56,523 --> 01:44:59,892
...that it's now Neary's fight.

1854
01:44:59,893 --> 01:45:06,365
[announcer 1] Ward hasn't been in this kind
of war with this strong of fighter as Neary.

1855
01:45:06,366 --> 01:45:10,703
[announcer 2] They are trying to
hurt each other with every punch.

1856
01:45:10,704 --> 01:45:15,124
They've tested each other's will, now
they're testing each other's skill.

1857
01:45:15,125 --> 01:45:18,711
[announcer 1] And Ward wobbled
there by a right cross from Neary!

1858
01:45:18,712 --> 01:45:21,414
Ward hurting now.
His legs are gone.

1859
01:45:21,882 --> 01:45:25,251
Neary goes to the body
as he tries to finish Micky.

1860
01:45:26,136 --> 01:45:28,137
[announcer 2]
Vicious body shots from Neary.

1861
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:31,924
[announcer 1] And Ward still doesn't
even try to move off the ropes!

1862
01:45:32,309 --> 01:45:34,477
[announcer 2]
I don't know if he can, Jim.

1863
01:45:34,478 --> 01:45:36,812
He's waiting for Neary
to punch himself out.

1864
01:45:36,813 --> 01:45:40,683
- [announcer 1] Down goes Micky Ward! He may be out.
- [Dicky] That ain't fuckin' it!

1865
01:45:41,268 --> 01:45:45,771
- One... two...
- Come on! That's it!

1866
01:45:45,772 --> 01:45:49,275
- [Alice] That's my boy!
- [Dicky] Forward! Forward! Come on!

1867
01:45:49,276 --> 01:45:51,077
[bell dinging]

1868
01:45:51,078 --> 01:45:53,079
- [crowd clamoring]
- [announcer 1] Ward is out on his feet.

1869
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:56,282
[man shouting] Loser!
Go back to America!

1870
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:58,250
[announcer 1] This could
be it for Micky Ward.

1871
01:45:58,251 --> 01:45:59,752
Dicky, give him
the fuckin' stool.

1872
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:01,871
Charlene, will you get
the fuck outta here.

1873
01:46:01,872 --> 01:46:04,507
- He needs to fuckin' sit down!
- Shh...

1874
01:46:04,508 --> 01:46:07,376
[announcer 3] His brother's got
Ward jumping to wake up his legs.

1875
01:46:07,377 --> 01:46:10,880
- [indistinct]
- I think this could be Ward's last chance

1876
01:46:10,881 --> 01:46:13,299
to turn this fight around.

1877
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:15,267
[announcer 1] It's Micky Ward
against the aggressiveness

1878
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:18,521
and clean punching
of Shea Neary.

1879
01:46:18,522 --> 01:46:20,523
[announcer 3] If you don't
have your defense up,

1880
01:46:20,524 --> 01:46:21,524
you can really get hurt.

1881
01:46:22,025 --> 01:46:24,060
He's making it very
difficult for Micky Ward.

1882
01:46:24,061 --> 01:46:27,146
I don't think he's gonna
get into it at this rate.

1883
01:46:27,147 --> 01:46:29,148
[announcer 1]
This is a survival mode...

1884
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:33,569
Are you like me? Huh? Was just
good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1885
01:46:33,570 --> 01:46:35,071
Never had to win, did I?

1886
01:46:35,072 --> 01:46:38,074
You gotta do more in there.
You gotta win a title.

1887
01:46:38,075 --> 01:46:41,544
For you, for me, for Lowell.

1888
01:46:41,545 --> 01:46:44,497
This is your time,
all right? You take it.

1889
01:46:44,498 --> 01:46:46,499
I had my time and I blew it.
You don't have to.

1890
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,000
All right?
You fuckin' get out there,

1891
01:46:48,502 --> 01:46:50,503
and use all the shit
that you've been through,

1892
01:46:50,504 --> 01:46:52,505
all the shit we've gone through
over the fuckin' years

1893
01:46:52,506 --> 01:46:55,508
and you put it in that ring right now.
This is yours. This is fuckin' yours.

1894
01:46:55,892 --> 01:46:58,811
OK. Fuckin' head,
body, head, body.

1895
01:46:58,812 --> 01:47:00,312
Say it back to me.
Fuckin' say it back to me.

1896
01:47:00,313 --> 01:47:02,314
- Head, body, head, body.
- Head, body, head, body.

1897
01:47:02,315 --> 01:47:04,934
Get in your mind this is
fucking yours. Fuckin' do it.

1898
01:47:04,935 --> 01:47:07,520
Stay off the fuckin' ropes.

1899
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:10,322
[crowd clamoring]

1900
01:47:12,025 --> 01:47:13,909
[announcer 3] If I'm in
Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1901
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:16,912
I thinking if he doesn't pick
things up this round and get going,

1902
01:47:16,913 --> 01:47:20,032
he'll just get
totally wiped out.

1903
01:47:21,451 --> 01:47:23,953
Off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!

1904
01:47:24,538 --> 01:47:27,923
[announcer 1] Once again, Ward against
the ropes as Neary is free to attack.

1905
01:47:27,924 --> 01:47:30,209
What are you doing?
Come on, Mick!

1906
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:34,547
[announcer 3] Sometimes if you wanna win,
you gotta be something that you're not.

1907
01:47:34,548 --> 01:47:36,632
[Dicky] Come on!

1908
01:47:36,967 --> 01:47:38,884
Off the fuckin' ropes,
Mick, that ain't it!

1909
01:47:38,885 --> 01:47:41,303
[announcer 1]
Neary continues to pound away.

1910
01:47:41,304 --> 01:47:43,773
[shouting]

1911
01:47:43,774 --> 01:47:48,144
[Dicky] Don't take no abuse!
This is your time Micky!

1912
01:47:48,145 --> 01:47:51,197
- It's up to you!
- [announcer 1] Two big misses by Neary!

1913
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:52,782
That's it! That's it!

1914
01:47:53,066 --> 01:47:56,068
Ward seemingly
getting his legs back.

1915
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:58,487
He backs Neary off.

1916
01:47:58,488 --> 01:48:00,406
- Ward trades his way back.
- That's it!

1917
01:48:00,407 --> 01:48:03,292
Ward nods as if to say,
"Come on!"

1918
01:48:03,293 --> 01:48:04,827
"Come on, let's fight!"

1919
01:48:05,245 --> 01:48:07,079
Just imagine if
you bought a ticket.

1920
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,381
Closer and closer
to Neary's ribcage.

1921
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:11,967
This is becoming
Micky Ward's fight.

1922
01:48:11,968 --> 01:48:14,470
And a left hook to the body
and an uppercut lands

1923
01:48:14,471 --> 01:48:17,173
- and now he backs Neary off.
- Head, body, head fuckin' body!

1924
01:48:18,258 --> 01:48:19,725
Ward hurt Neary
with a body shot.

1925
01:48:19,726 --> 01:48:23,262
Ward hurts him again
with that left to the body.

1926
01:48:23,263 --> 01:48:26,899
Oh, and that one plants
Neary on his butt.

1927
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:29,652
First time in
23 professional fights

1928
01:48:29,653 --> 01:48:33,322
- that Shea Neary has been down.
- This is it! This is it!

1929
01:48:33,323 --> 01:48:36,108
This is it, Micky!

1930
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:39,195
Keep going! Don't look at me
for it! Take it to him!

1931
01:48:41,531 --> 01:48:46,035
- [Dicky] Come on, Micky, get in there!
- Ward lands a huge left hook!

1932
01:48:46,036 --> 01:48:48,704
As Micky Ward pounds away!

1933
01:48:49,206 --> 01:48:52,591
Goes to the body with the left
hook! Lands the uppercut again!

1934
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:54,710
- [audience screaming]
- Neary down for the second time.

1935
01:48:54,711 --> 01:48:57,096
- Mickey Vann's gonna stop it right there.
- [bell dinging]

1936
01:48:57,097 --> 01:49:01,383
"Irish" Micky Ward with
a big eighth-round TKO!

1937
01:49:02,435 --> 01:49:03,435
[announcer 2]
He's done it again.

1938
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:06,605
- [screaming, chatter]
- He's done it again.

1939
01:49:06,606 --> 01:49:12,278
[announcer 1] The grinding, gutty Micky
Ward pulls out another big victory!

1940
01:49:24,241 --> 01:49:28,210
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fuckin' champ of the world!

1941
01:49:28,795 --> 01:49:30,880
You fuckin' did it!

Oh, you're the best!

1944
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:46,145
- Oh, I love you!
- My boy's the champion of the world!

1945
01:49:47,147 --> 01:49:48,647
I love you!

1949
01:50:18,962 --> 01:50:22,548
This town always said,
you're a fuckin' boxer, right?

1950
01:50:22,549 --> 01:50:26,552
He thought he was a piece of shit. He
put Lowell back on the map, you know?

1951
01:50:26,553 --> 01:50:27,553
- We.
- I tell ya...

1952
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:30,522
- We.
- No, but hold on.

1953
01:50:30,523 --> 01:50:32,558
Who used to be
the pride of Lowell? Huh?

1954
01:50:32,559 --> 01:50:35,060
Right here.
Who's the pride of Lowell now?

1955
01:50:35,061 --> 01:50:38,063
Right there. That's how
it's meant to be, you know?

1956
01:50:38,064 --> 01:50:40,065
Handin' it down to him.

1957
01:50:40,066 --> 01:50:41,567
[voice breaking]
Nothin' better than that.

1958
01:50:41,568 --> 01:50:43,569
Nothin' better than that.

1959
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:47,573
He did it. I gotta go.
[laughs] I gotta go.

Oh, I'm under arrest!
Let's go, move it out!

1966
01:51:30,116 --> 01:51:32,618

- It's been real, it's been unreal.

1967
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:35,120
It's been a great
experience. Um...

1968
01:51:35,121 --> 01:51:36,622
