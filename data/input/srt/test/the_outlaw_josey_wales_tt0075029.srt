1
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,000
Get up, girl. Get up!

2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,920
Whoa!

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,200
Little Josey!

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Come on in. Let´s get you cleaned up.

5
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,320
Better go.

6
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,680
Josey!

7
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,320
Pa!

8
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,520
Ashes to ashes...

9
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,640
...dust to dust...

10
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,200
...the Lord gives...

11
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,119
...the Lord takes away.

12
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,160
The name´s Anderson.

13
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,880
Bloody Bill is what they call me.

14
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,320
Redlegs?

15
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,440
You´ll find them up in IKansas.

16
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,399
They´re with the Union.

17
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,559
And we´re going up there
and set things aright.

18
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
I´ll come with you.

19
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,599
All that a fellow has to do...

20
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,239
...is ride into that Union camp
down there...

21
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:33,799
...raise his right hand and swear
you´ll be loyal to the United States.

22
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,520
Then he can take up his horse again...

23
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,840
...and go home.

24
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,239
They´ll give us full amnesty then?

25
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,799
Yep.

26
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,440
Everyone else has done it but us.

27
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
We´re the last holdouts.

28
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,760
I´m going in. I´ve had enough.

29
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,760
Better go with them, boy.

30
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,359
You coming with us?

31
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,440
I reckon not, Fletcher.

32
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,440
They´ll be coming after you.

33
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,559
Yep.

34
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,479
There´s nowhere to go to get away.

35
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,159
I reckon that´s true.

36
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,440
Good luck.

37
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,119
Put the rifle down too.

38
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,000
-I´ll need it for squirrels and such.
-Put it down.

39
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,000
IKind of young, ain´t you, kid, to be
riding with this rabble?

40
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,119
Who you calling rabble,
you blue scumbelly?

41
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,679
Hell, we showed these boys, anyway.

42
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,359
Lee might have had to surrender,
but we didn´t.

43
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,200
-Shut up, kid.
-Yes, sir.

44
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,760
You showed us.

45
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,559
Now get in line...

46
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,599
...before I kick you so hard you´ll
wear your ass for a hat.

47
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,640
Here´s the man you asked for, sir.

48
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,719
-Fletcher. Good to see you.
-Senator.

49
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,000
Well done.

50
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,239
Thank you.

51
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,599
What the hell is this Redleg
doing here?

52
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,719
You said regular federal authorities
would handle this.

53
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:27,039
Captain Terrill is the
regular federal authority now.

54
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,760
Captain Terrill is
a bloodthirsty son of a bitch!

55
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,200
He is a looter and a pillager!

56
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,039
He´s those men´s worst enemy!

57
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,719
The war´s over.

58
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,000
Our side won the war.

59
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,599
Now we must busy ourselves
winning the peace.

60
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,400
And Fletcher, there´s an old saying,
"To the victors belong the spoils."

61
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,799
And there´s another
old saying, senator:

62
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:03,000
"Don´t piss down my back and
tell me it´s raining."

63
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,280
Which side is this man on, senator?

64
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,640
Easy. He brought them in, didn´t he?

65
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,559
-All but one.
-Who´s that?

66
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,479
Josey Wales.

67
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,760
Josey Wales.

68
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,799
Captain Terrill, I want you to
currycomb the countryside.

69
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:30,200
You beat the brush and root out
everything disloyal...

70
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,719
...from a Shanghai rooster to
a Durham cow!

71
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,760
We´ve got to clean up this country.

72
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:42,080
Now you take five men and go up there
and get Josey Wales.

73
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:48,760
Captain Redlegs Terrill and five men
against Josey Wales?

74
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,760
We stopped those bushwhackers
pretty good during the war.

75
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,440
You go with Captain Terrill.

76
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,840
Bring in this damn
insurrectionist rebel.

77
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,680
Here´s the money for bringing
the others...

78
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,400
...and there´ll be more
for Josey Wales.

79
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,920
I´ve had enough
of your money, senator.

80
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,160
Let Wales be.

81
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,800
Let me be.

82
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,319
I´m finished with you.

83
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,199
All right...

84
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:41,680
...l want you men to raise
your right hands.

85
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,119
What for?

86
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:46,680
So you can pledge loyalty
to the Union.

87
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,560
Hell, pledge loyalty to the Union?

88
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,119
You ought to have us turn around
and bend over.

89
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,599
All raise your right hands so
I can take your oath.

90
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,319
"I pledge...

91
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,119
...that I will be loyal to
the United States of America."

92
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,880
I pledge that I will be loyal...

93
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,640
...to the United States of America.

94
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:12,160
"That I will...."

95
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,400
Let´s see. "I will abide by its law...

96
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,479
...that I will never bear arms
against it."

97
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,640
I will abide by its law...

98
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:24,199
...that I will never bear arms
against it.

99
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,520
"And recognize...

100
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,199
...that it is one nation."

101
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,479
And recognize...

102
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,040
...that it is one nation.

103
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,959
-I ain´t doing it.
-Come on, kid.

104
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,239
Let´s get this over with, damn it!

105
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
But I been thinking.

106
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:43,040
I think it´s them who owes
an apology.

107
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,280
"And I further swear, that though...

108
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,479
...l be murderous...."

109
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,599
Look! That´s Josey!

110
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:59,319
Verminous, lying, Missouri scum!

111
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,400
Damn you, senator!

112
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,119
You promised me those men would be
decently treated.

113
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,479
They were decently treated.

114
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,719
They were decently fed...

115
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,959
...and then they were decently shot.

116
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
These men are common outlaws,
nothing more.

117
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,800
Run for it, Fletcher, it´s a trap!

118
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,680
Josey, we best be on our way.

119
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,479
-Get moving, boy.
-They´re coming after us.

120
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,439
We´ve got to take to the brush!

121
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
You get going!

122
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:12,800
You can´t get them all.

123
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That´s a fact.

124
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,479
Why you doing it then?

125
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,880
I´ve got nothing better to do.

126
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,520
Fletcher was in with them.
It was a trap!

127
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,359
Fletcher?

128
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
Never would have figured that.

129
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,760
You dumb kid.

130
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,319
I´ve got to tell you something.

131
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,839
I´m scared of dying.

132
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,760
Move out!

133
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,520
You are going after him, after all.

134
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,400
Fletcher, l´m giving you a commission.

135
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,599
Hound this Wales to kingdom come.

136
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,640
Hound him, senator?

137
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,400
A man like Wales lives by the feud.

138
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,719
Because of what you did here today,
l´ve got to kill him.

139
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,479
He´ll have to run for it now.

140
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,839
And hell is where he´s headed.

141
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,199
He´ll be waiting there
for us, senator.

142
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,560
Don´t hold back on account of me.
I can ride.

143
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,560
I ain´t holding back on account of you,
you thick-headed grasshopper.

144
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,160
If we ride in the open, there´s enough
posses over in South Missouri...

145
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,280
...to start another war.

146
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,160
And if we try riding
instead of thinking...

147
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,479
...we´ll end up hanging by a rope
by nightfall.

148
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,719
Where are we headed?

149
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
The lndian Nations.

150
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,319
It´s a good place to hole up
and get you healed up.

151
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,880
Then we´ll go get Fletcher?

152
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,160
Right, boy.

153
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,040
Then we go back and get Fletcher.

154
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,000
There´s some riders
coming up behind us.

155
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,439
Get down here, boy.
Lay across his neck.

156
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,199
IKeep him down there.

157
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,439
Can you hear me?

158
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,119
Now if you see me get up,
you stay there, understand?

159
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,400
If you hear shooting and
me headed back north...

160
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,040
...get back on that horse.
He´ll get up with you...

161
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
...and you head south, now you hear?

162
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,800
You can let him up now, boy.

163
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,319
Let him up!

164
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:03,920
Get up, goddamn it!

165
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,400
Whupped them again, didn´t we?

166
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,239
Whupped them again, boy.

167
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:28,839
Ten years l´ve been ferrying
IKansas Redlegs...

168
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,160
...Union Cavalry,
Missouri guerrillas...

169
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,880
...you name it!

170
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,079
Mad dogs, them guerrillas!

171
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,400
You look sideways at them...

172
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,160
...they kill you!

173
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,839
Hard men to do business with.

174
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,319
You bet!

175
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:46,479
You know, in my line of work...

176
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,040
...you got to be able either to sing
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic"...

177
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:53,119
...or "Dixie" with equal enthusiasm...

178
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,959
...depending upon present company.

179
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,439
Can´t say as I blame you for that.

180
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,479
Only good business to play it safe.

181
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,439
Thank God they all been
disarmed now...

182
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,839
...except for a few of the
nastiest ones...

183
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,319
...who they´re busy running down.

184
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,760
Where l´m going, they know
how to handle that kind.

185
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,800
Where are you headed?

186
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,079
I´m going to ply my wares
down in Texas.

187
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,640
Texas, huh?

188
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,160
How much for the ferry ride?

189
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,920
10 cents.

190
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,640
By coincidence, I happen to have a
bottle of this remarkable elixir...

191
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,280
...for that exact amount.

192
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,920
Sim Carstairs is the name.

193
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,160
Mister...?

194
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,079
Figured we´d give you some
ferrying business.

195
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,640
With pleasure!

196
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,439
Bill Quantrill used this ferry
all the time.

197
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,400
Good friend of mine.

198
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,560
What have you got there?

199
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,800
Just the store with
Grannie Hawkins up there.

200
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,839
I´ll tell you what.

201
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,719
We´ll all just amble over
to that store.

202
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:17,880
Him and me will ride.
We´ve got a touch of the cramp.

203
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,119
You´re in luck!

204
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:22,199
I just happen to have the perfect
thing here for cramps.

205
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,040
We´ll need half a side of bacon...

206
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:29,920
...10 pounds of beef jerky,
20 pounds of horse grain.

207
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,719
And when we get over there, there won´t
be any need for you to go inside.

208
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,680
Just tell Old Grannie through the door,
we´ll need a lot of clean bandages...

209
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,880
...and a boiled poultice for a
bullet wound, in a hurry. Come on.

210
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,560
So you´ll be Josey Wales.

211
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,760
How might you know that, Grannie?

212
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:05,359
Soldiers were here looking
for you two hours ago.

213
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,040
I was going to mention that to you
as soon as I got the chance.

214
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,959
They say you killed your own men.

215
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
Those lying blue scumbellies!

216
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:17,439
They say you´re a hard-put
and desperate man.

217
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:21,239
They´re going to heel and hog you
to a barn door.

218
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,000
You know what I say?

219
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:25,680
What´s that?

220
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,599
I say that big talk´s worth
diddlysquat.

221
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Now them poultices be laced with
feather moss and mustard root.

222
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:36,439
Mind you drop water on them
occasionally and keep them damp.

223
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,359
Much obliged, Grannie.

224
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,680
You can pay me when you see me again,
Josey Wales.

225
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,040
I reckon so.

226
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,680
That sure is a sweet sound
to the ears...

227
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,119
...wouldn´t you say so, Mr. Wales?

228
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,239
Your young friend can use some help.

229
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:11,160
This is it. One dollar a bottle.

230
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,479
It works wonders on wounds.

231
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,599
Works wonders on
just about everything.

232
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
It can do most anything.

233
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,439
How is it with stains?

234
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,599
Here we go.

235
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,119
Dismount. Disembark, children.

236
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,959
Get that back!

237
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,520
Bring it back!

238
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,479
Bring that barge back!

239
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Bring it back!

240
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:05,000
Whupped them again, Josey.

241
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,439
They´re hollering for me to come over!

242
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,760
I can´t hold on.

243
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:14,000
But l´ll hold on until you fellows
get out of sight.

244
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,680
All right?

245
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,839
I´ll make do something´s wrong--

246
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,479
Pull, Lemuel. Pull!

247
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,119
I´ll make do something´s wrong,
until you get going.

248
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:26,520
I wish you all lots of luck.

249
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,959
Pull, Lemuel, pull!

250
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,439
He ain´t going to hold up no ferry.

251
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,479
He´s going to bring that cavalry
over fast as he can.

252
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,319
Reckon there´s a nice reward out
for us about now.

253
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,199
We got him now.

254
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,920
We´ll get those two first,
then the others.

255
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,479
What others?

256
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Wales and the kid are the last ones.

257
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,239
Texas is full of rebels.

258
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,319
Lots of work to do down in Texas.

259
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,839
We get Josey Wales and it ends.

260
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,000
Doing right ain´t got no end.

261
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,199
We best hurry on, Josey.

262
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,719
They´d catch up to us
by the end of the day.

263
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,359
Judging by these tracks,
there´s maybe...

264
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,000
...40, 50 horses ahead of us.

265
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:35,079
What we´ve got to do is space
some time between them and us.

266
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,680
What are we going to do?

267
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:40,359
Stay right here.

268
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,079
Welcome.

269
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,079
Welcome, gentlemen.

270
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,119
Pull, Lemuel.

271
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,880
He´s still there.

272
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:05,040
What does he think he´s doing?

273
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,040
Don´t know.

274
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,719
Some of you men get down there.
Prepare to fire.

275
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,920
Captain Redlegs...

276
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,280
...l advise you to turn back.

277
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:17,079
You can catch him later.

278
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,880
Turn back? Are you crazy?

279
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,079
He´ll try to pick us off one by one.

280
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:24,239
He´ll never do it.

281
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:26,359
At best, he´ll get 2 or 3 up front.

282
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:31,040
I advise you to turn back, captain.

283
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,800
They´re coming.

284
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,560
Do you really think you can shoot
all those men down...

285
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,719
...before they shoot you?

286
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,400
No, Mr. Josey Wales!

287
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,359
There is such a thing in this country
called justice.

288
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,719
Well, Mr. Carpetbagger...

289
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:17,560
...we´ve got something in this
territory...

290
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,439
...called the Missouri boat ride.

291
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,640
God Almighty!

292
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,360
Is it bad?

293
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,000
It´s bad.

294
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,879
Don´t look at it, boy.

295
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,919
It´ll just make you
get feelings in it.

296
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,840
If I don´t make it...

297
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,679
...l want you to know...

298
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:36,479
...l´m prouder than a game rooster
to have rid with you.

299
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,879
You are a game rooster.
Now shut up.

300
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,840
You could make it without me.

301
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,239
Take a little drink of this.

302
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,120
This here linsey-woolsey shirt I got
that all you boys wore.

303
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,320
We didn´t have no ma.

304
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:11,479
So Pa did all the
fancy needlework for me.

305
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:15,840
Told me not to tell no one.

306
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,399
Imagine a grown man doing that
for his own kid?

307
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,199
Sang a little song while he sewed it.

308
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,360
You know "Rose of Alabama"?

309
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:59,639
Now you just do that, cousin.
You bring that old pistol right out.

310
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,439
We got him, Lige.

311
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:05,080
It´s him, Abe. It´s him.

312
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,840
We got the Josey Wales, Abe!

313
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,479
I seen him ride side by side
with Bloody Bill.

314
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,439
We got reward money coming.

315
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,479
Watch it, Abe.

316
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,919
He´s meaner than a rattler
and twice as fast!

317
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,360
You´re a real bush hog,
ain´t you, Mr. Josey Wales?

318
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,560
Tell you what.

319
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:24,439
Move on back. Move on back!

320
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,679
Watch him.
I seen him do some things.

321
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:28,280
Shut up, Lige!

322
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,120
Now...

323
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:37,760
...Mr. Josey Wales...

324
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,719
...l´d just as soon shoot you now...

325
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:43,679
...except it´d be hard to drag the body
to where we can get our price for you.

326
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,760
Shoot him now!

327
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,679
Shut up, Lige.

328
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,639
Move your left hand down and
unbuckle that pistol belt.

329
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,719
Make it nice and slow...

330
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,399
...so I can count the hairs
on that hand.

331
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,120
See, Lige?

332
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,520
You pull his teeth...

333
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,600
...he´s harmless as a heel hound.

334
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:32,320
Always wanted to face out one of these
pistol fighters they all fuss about.

335
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,760
Only way you handle them.

336
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,840
Abe, watch out.

337
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:39,879
-He´s probably got another pistol--
-Shut up, Lige.

338
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,199
Call Benny back there on the horse.

339
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,679
Benny! Come out!

340
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,479
We got us the Josey Wales!

341
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,600
Who is that?

342
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,199
He´s just a boy. He´s got a fever.

343
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,439
Tell him to shut up.

344
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:06,560
Pa?

345
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:07,959
Is that you, Pa?

346
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,800
It ain´t your pa!

347
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,840
Now shut up!

348
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:15,360
I got the gold right here, Pa.

349
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,320
What gold is he talking about?

350
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,760
There´s no gold. He´s crazy.

351
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,199
The gold me and Josey robbed
from the bank.

352
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:29,280
Take a look under that blanket.

353
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,719
I got it right here.

354
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,080
Thought you could use some help.

355
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,520
You get those holes leaking, l´m going
to whomp you with a knotted plow line.

356
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,800
They ain´t honest.

357
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,639
I feel as pert as a rutting buck.

358
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,000
Good.

359
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,919
Because I ain´t hauling you
all over hell´s creation...

360
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,439
...dribbling blood over
half of Missouri.

361
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,399
Wish we had time to bury them fellows.

362
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,239
To hell with them fellows.

363
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:24,399
Buzzards got to eat, same as worms.

364
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,040
A real frog strangler.

365
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,719
10, 20 more miles and we´ll be
safe in the Nations.

366
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:04,760
Some cavalry between us
and the Nations.

367
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:07,280
We´ll have to wait
till they bed down...

368
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:09,000
...then walk through quiet.

369
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,479
Here, have some beef jerky.

370
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,159
Don´t swallow nothing but the juice.
I´ll go have a look-see.

371
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,800
You feel all right?

372
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,120
I feel real good, Josey.
We got them whupped.

373
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,000
I want to thank you.

374
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,080
For what?

375
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,239
For saving my life.

376
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,280
Forget about that, Jamie.

377
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,239
You know something, Josey?

378
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,120
I ain´t scared no more.

379
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:12,159
We can start working our way
through now, boy.

380
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,520
This rain is giving us the--

381
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,280
This boy was brought up in a...

382
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,479
...time of blood and dying,
and never questioned a bit of it.

383
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,199
Never turned his back
on his folks or his kind.

384
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,320
I rode with him, I got no complaints.

385
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:57,199
The bluebellies will give you
a better burial than I can, boy.

386
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:45,399
My name is Josey Wales.

387
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,439
I´ve heard of that name.

388
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,399
Some said you´d be headed this way.

389
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,879
And they said a man could get rich
on reward money...

390
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,520
...if he could kill you.

391
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:03,320
Seems like you were looking
to gain some money here.

392
00:44:03,879 --> 00:44:06,919
Actually, I was looking
to gain an edge.

393
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,639
I thought you might be someone who
would sneak up behind me with a gun.

394
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,360
Where´d you ever get
an idea like that?

395
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,520
It ain´t supposed to be easy
to sneak up behind an lndian.

396
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:21,080
I´m an lndian, all right.

397
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,399
But here in the Nation,
they call us the civilized tribe.

398
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:30,639
They call us civilized because
we´re easy to sneak up on.

399
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,919
White men have been sneaking up
on us for years.

400
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:38,520
Cherokee, huh?

401
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:45,879
They sneaked up on us and they
told us we wouldn´t be happy here.

402
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,439
They said we would be happier
in the Nations.

403
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,000
So they took away our land...

404
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:55,000
...and sent us here.

405
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:59,239
I have a fine woman...

406
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,040
...and two sons.

407
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,439
But they all died on the
Trail of Tears.

408
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,320
And now the white man
is sneaking up on me.

409
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,000
Again.

410
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,520
Seems like we can´t trust
the white man.

411
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:25,919
You bet we can´t.

412
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,919
I wore this...

413
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:33,399
...frock coat in Washington.

414
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,000
Before the war.

415
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:38,560
We wore them because we belonged to...

416
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,879
...the five civilized tribes.

417
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,239
We dressed ourselves up
like Abraham Lincoln.

418
00:45:49,879 --> 00:45:54,479
We got to see the
secretary of the interior.

419
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,000
And he said:

420
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,639
"Boy! You boys sure look civilized!"

421
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,239
He congratulated us...

422
00:46:04,439 --> 00:46:08,159
...and he gave us medals for
looking so civilized.

423
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,919
We told him about how
our land had been stolen...

424
00:46:12,399 --> 00:46:14,399
...and our people were dying.

425
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,639
When we finished,
he shook our hands...

426
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,159
...and said:

427
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,800
"Endeavor to persevere."

428
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:26,239
They stood us in a line.

429
00:46:26,439 --> 00:46:29,399
John Jumper, Chilly Mclntosh...

430
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:31,760
...Buffalo Hump...

431
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:35,560
...and Jim Pock Mark and me.

432
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,959
I´m Lone Watie.

433
00:46:37,399 --> 00:46:39,320
They took our pictures.

434
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,040
And the newspaper said:

435
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,959
"Indians Vow to
Endeavor to Persevere."

436
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,040
We thought about it for a long time.

437
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:52,959
"Endeavor to persevere."

438
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,280
And when we had thought
about it long enough...

439
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:00,320
...we declared war on the Union.

440
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,639
Sergeant said this kid tried to ride
through their camp. They got him.

441
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:20,879
They did, did they?

442
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,439
They´ve had men on guard here
night and day.

443
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:26,719
No way Wales could get to the Nations.

444
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,959
Where are you going, Fletcher?

445
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:36,560
I´m heading into the lndian Nations.

446
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,040
Why don´t you stay here, Redlegs?

447
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:41,919
Wales may be back in a year or two.

448
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:48,120
When we get to the Nations,
I want you men to fan out.

449
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:50,919
$5000 to the one who gets him.

450
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:13,040
A horned toad can tell you
which way to go.

451
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,760
I used to know these things
when I was young.

452
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,719
But when I got civilized,
I forgot all these things.

453
00:48:20,919 --> 00:48:22,800
I didn´t know which way to go.

454
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,239
The horned toad says
we should go to Mexico.

455
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,840
Well, Mr. Lone Watie...

456
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,879
...you can take your horned toad
down Mexico way.

457
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,120
I´ve got some unfinished
business in Missouri.

458
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,159
I heard General Joe Shelby...

459
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,239
...and some men refused to surrender.

460
00:48:50,399 --> 00:48:52,000
They´re going down to Mexico.

461
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,560
I think l´ll join them.

462
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:55,560
Shelby, huh?

463
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,679
I didn´t know others
hadn´t surrendered.

464
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,840
I didn´t surrender, neither.

465
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,679
But they took my horse
and made him surrender.

466
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:06,959
They have him pulling a wagon
up in IKansas, l´ll bet.

467
00:49:09,919 --> 00:49:11,600
You haven´t got a horse.

468
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,199
What do you plan on doing,
walking to Mexico?

469
00:49:14,399 --> 00:49:17,280
No, there´s a trading post
right near the Creek Nation.

470
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:19,360
They got horses to trade.

471
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,439
You have any food here?

472
00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:27,040
All I have is a piece of
hard rock candy.

473
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:30,040
But it´s not for eating.

474
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:32,399
It´s just for looking through.

475
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,919
All right.

476
00:49:40,919 --> 00:49:42,760
I´ll get you a horse.

477
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:06,560
What have you got there?

478
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,800
Muskrat.

479
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,479
Muskrat?

480
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:10,719
What the hell´s that?

481
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:12,239
Muskrat.

482
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,239
No, sir. You got to
come up with something more.

483
00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:18,800
-Beaver?
-Beaver ain´t no good no more.

484
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,800
Get me 10 muskrats...

485
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:23,479
...and 30 beaver pelts...

486
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,719
...and l´ll give you red cloth.

487
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,399
Now that´s a very good
bargain for you.

488
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:33,800
Here.

489
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,879
You go have a drink
and think about it.

490
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,760
You bring some drink inside, you hear?

491
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,600
I´ll tell you, this jerky...

492
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,320
...put it on our bill.

493
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,800
What about these cougar pelts?

494
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,040
Going to put them on our bill too?

495
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,399
This what you give those lndians.

496
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:23,600
Where´s the real stuff?

497
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,560
What do you take for the squaw?

498
00:51:41,919 --> 00:51:43,600
She ain´t for sale.

499
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,760
I mean, she ain´t mine.

500
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,919
She works here.

501
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,560
See that nose scar?

502
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,840
IKnow what that means to a Cheyenne?

503
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,719
One too many bucks.

504
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:03,840
Little squaw likes the bucks, huh?

505
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,840
Tell you, Zukie, you put her
on the bill too.

506
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,159
I´ll be looking for a horse.

507
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,280
A horse?

508
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:44,840
The horses belong to these gentlemen.

509
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,679
More than likely--
That is...

510
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:50,080
...l´m sure they´d sell you one.

511
00:52:56,879 --> 00:52:58,959
Look, l´ve got some beer.

512
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:00,959
Some good brewed choc.

513
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,120
It´s on the house.

514
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,080
You suppose these gentlemen will be...

515
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:24,959
...available to discuss business
before long?

516
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,600
Give me a bucket of that choc.

517
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,719
I got him!

518
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,239
I got me Josey Wales!

519
00:53:48,879 --> 00:53:52,159
5000 gold simoleons walked right in.

520
00:53:52,439 --> 00:53:54,479
-Right to us.
-Wait a minute!

521
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:55,840
He´s in my place.

522
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,439
I recognized him too.

523
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,320
I´m due an even split.

524
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,959
Mr. Chain-Blue Lightning himself.

525
00:54:09,439 --> 00:54:12,080
The one that everyone´s so scared of.

526
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,639
Well, Mr. Lightning...

527
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,560
...move a muscle, twitch a finger...

528
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,199
...and l´ll splatter your guts
all over the wall.

529
00:54:24,919 --> 00:54:26,600
When I say move...

530
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,600
...you move real slow...

531
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,679
...like molasses in wintertime.

532
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,600
All right, drop that hammer.

533
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,320
Now, just ease your hands down.

534
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:41,199
Take them guns out, butt first
so´s you can get hold of them.

535
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,239
You understand?

536
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,439
Nod, damn you!

537
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,040
Now...

538
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,159
...ease them pistols out.

539
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:28,760
Well, let´s see...

540
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,280
...you say those horses belong
to them pilgrims?

541
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,080
I´m getting better at sneaking up
on you like this.

542
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,080
Only an lndian can do
something like this.

543
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:19,479
That´s what I figured.

544
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,080
You figured?

545
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,840
Only an lndian could do
something like that.

546
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,159
It´s not right, this damn woman
doing something like this to me.

547
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,120
I used to have power.

548
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,520
Now old age is creeping up on me.

549
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,239
I think it´s more like
old habits than old age.

550
00:56:54,399 --> 00:56:56,239
Who the hell is this woman?

551
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,600
She was back at the trading post.
Got in some kind of trouble.

552
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,639
She´s not going to Mexico with us.

553
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,679
With us?

554
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:08,080
Now wait a minute. I got you a horse.
You´re on your own now.

555
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,879
I´ve seen a lot today.

556
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,600
I´ve seen patrols of soldiers all day.

557
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,719
Everybody´s looking for you.

558
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:20,280
She´s not going with us.

559
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:36,040
She says she´s Navajo...

560
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:38,800
...but she was captured
by the Cheyenne.

561
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,760
She was violated by one of the bucks
of the Arapahos.

562
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,520
Their sign is the dirty nose sign.

563
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:48,000
Cheyenne Chief, Black IKettle...

564
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:52,080
...figures that she did not
resist enough.

565
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,919
Hell, man, can´t you get
her to shut up?

566
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,520
Anyway, she says...

567
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:31,399
...when she came
to that trading post...

568
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,520
...she didn´t know this man,
Zukie Limmer...

569
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,120
...was selling liquor.

570
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,639
She also wants you to know...

571
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,120
...that although he beat her a lot...

572
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,719
...nothing happened between them.

573
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:47,800
And she says
you are a great warrior...

574
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,679
...and that she sort of belongs to you
for what you done for her.

575
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,959
Look, you tell her I don´t want
nobody belonging to me.

576
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:01,600
That meal was damn good.

577
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,760
I´m going to take up tepee living
if it´s like this.

578
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,399
You know, she thinks l´m some kind
of a Cherokee chief.

579
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:14,919
I wonder where she ever got that idea.

580
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,320
Chief!

581
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:33,080
I was just wondering.

582
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,600
I suppose that mangy hound´s
got no place else to go either.

583
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:43,679
He might as well ride along with us.

584
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:46,399
Hell, everybody else is.

585
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,919
Hey, you!

586
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,639
Want to buy some lndian scalps?

587
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:41,679
Nasty habit, young fellow.

588
01:01:41,919 --> 01:01:43,879
You born in the barn?

589
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,919
The wheat is from IKansas and the
molasses comes from Missouri.

590
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,600
We´ll do without molasses.

591
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,120
Anything from Missouri
has a taint about it.

592
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,399
Grandma, you´ve got to tread
lightly now we´re here in Texas.

593
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,000
Lots of nice elements from
Missouri coming West.

594
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,439
Nothing nice comes from Missouri.
And treading lightly is not my way.

595
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:18,199
We´re from IKansas.
Jayhawkers, and proud of it.

596
01:02:18,399 --> 01:02:20,760
I know how you feel.
I´m a Hoosier, myself.

597
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:24,239
Personally, I don´t think much
of Hoosiers neither.

598
01:02:34,399 --> 01:02:35,760
Yes, friends, yes!

599
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:39,000
This is a positive remedy
for weariness...

600
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:42,520
...turgidity of the bowels and--

601
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:47,560
Say, you´re an lndian, aren´t you?

602
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:52,000
You speak any English?

603
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:55,120
Well, sir, this is the
very best thing...

604
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,760
...for those who can´t handle
their liquor.

605
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,520
What´s in it?

606
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:08,159
I don´t know. Various things.
I´m only the salesman.

607
01:03:09,879 --> 01:03:10,959
You drink it.

608
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:12,399
What´s that?

609
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:15,639
You drink it.

610
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:25,719
What can you expect
from a nonbeliever?

611
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,320
That old lady don´t know the trouble
she can get into talking like that.

612
01:03:30,879 --> 01:03:33,439
Too many folks around here
with thin skin.

613
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:36,399
Lots of Southern boys
been getting into trouble here.

614
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,800
Cullen Baker and Captain Bob Lee
been fighting over in Fannin County.

615
01:03:40,959 --> 01:03:42,760
Bill Longley, Creed Taylor...

616
01:03:42,959 --> 01:03:45,919
...and all them other Taylors
down in Gonzalez.

617
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,479
IKilled Simp Dixon
over in Cotton Gin...

618
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:50,479
...weighted him down with lead.

619
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,879
I got a picture postcard of it.

620
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:56,959
Here. Have a look.

621
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,080
Josey Wales.

622
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,439
What say?

623
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,080
Josey Wales.
They say he´s coming into Texas.

624
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,320
Won´t come through here, though.
IKilled 50, 60 men.

625
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,560
Regulators are all over the place
looking for him.

626
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,679
How much for all this?

627
01:04:17,879 --> 01:04:19,040
Three dollars.

628
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,760
Those regulators would pay plenty...

629
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:24,959
...to the man who could
identify Josey Wales.

630
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:28,040
Reckon so.

631
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,159
How about you, sir?

632
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,399
Just a few bottles left.
You won´t regret it.

633
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,320
Oh, my God!

634
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,040
It´s Josey Wales!

635
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:24,800
You going to pull those pistols
or whistle "Dixie"?

636
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:21,879
Goddamn lndian squaw!

637
01:06:24,919 --> 01:06:25,919
Let´s go!

638
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:04,239
Welcome to Texas, Mr. Lone Watie.

639
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,760
I guess we ain´t going to see that
little Navajo girl again.

640
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,600
I guess not.

641
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,719
I kind of liked her.

642
01:07:13,919 --> 01:07:16,320
-But it´s always like that.
-Like what?

643
01:07:17,399 --> 01:07:20,120
Whenever I get to liking someone,
they ain´t around long.

644
01:07:20,479 --> 01:07:25,080
I notice when you get to disliking
someone they ain´t around long neither.

645
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:30,959
How did you know which one
was going to shoot first?

646
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:34,520
That one in the center
had a flap holster...

647
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:36,719
...and he was in no itching hurry.

648
01:07:37,399 --> 01:07:39,159
And the one second from the left...

649
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,719
...had scared eyes.
He wasn´t going to do nothing.

650
01:07:41,919 --> 01:07:43,719
But that one on the far left...

651
01:07:43,919 --> 01:07:47,320
...had crazy eyes.
Figured him to make the first move.

652
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,959
And the one on the right?

653
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:55,800
Never paid no him no mind.

654
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,080
You were there.

655
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:03,760
I could have missed.

656
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,719
Yes, sir! It was Josey Wales,
all right!

657
01:08:06,919 --> 01:08:09,879
Saw him heading north out of town
with a renegade lnjun.

658
01:08:10,959 --> 01:08:12,479
I can identify him.

659
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:16,560
And l´d certainly be glad
to share in any reward.

660
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,799
IKnew him quite well, actually.

661
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,799
Well, not a hard man to track.

662
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:27,680
Leaves dead men wherever he goes.

663
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,520
He´s heading north now...

664
01:08:30,919 --> 01:08:32,919
...riding with a renegade lndian.

665
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,560
He´s heading north now,
but he´ll turn southwest...

666
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:38,160
...head for Mexico.

667
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:41,160
Then we´ll turn southwest
and head for Mexico.

668
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,479
Tell them to head north.

669
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,759
What are you talking about?

670
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,279
Look at those boys over there
with tied-down guns.

671
01:08:53,959 --> 01:08:55,600
Bounty hunters.

672
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,640
Come out of a war, got no other way
to make a living.

673
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,279
Every last mother´s son of them wants
that money you´ve got on Wales´ head.

674
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,720
You and me didn´t ride
all that way for that.

675
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,680
I don´t want to hear Wales is dead.

676
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,160
I want to see Wales dead.

677
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:21,919
We´re heading north, men.
Let´s ride.

678
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,759
They´re following us.

679
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,040
Couple of horses, far off,
moving fast.

680
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,759
I don´t hear nothing.

681
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,799
Got to be an lndian to know
those things.

682
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,080
All right, let´s take them
out in the sand.

683
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,120
Glad you stopped me when you did.
I might have killed her.

684
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,200
I noticed that.

685
01:11:24,959 --> 01:11:27,439
She got some supplies...

686
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,240
...and our horses...

687
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:31,479
...and followed us around.

688
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,799
She said we were the only kin she had.

689
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:37,319
I bet we are, at that.

690
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,160
You know, every man I ever knew...

691
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:43,640
...who was good
with a gun and lived...

692
01:11:43,839 --> 01:11:45,879
...always had an edge.

693
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,040
Some of them would like to have
the sun behind their back.

694
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,240
That´s always a good idea.

695
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,520
Sure pays to have an edge.

696
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:06,560
All kind of edges.

697
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:45,160
Howdy.

698
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,279
Is something wrong?

699
01:12:49,839 --> 01:12:51,799
I guess you were right.

700
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,560
I ain´t that old after all.

701
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,279
Not many men west of here.

702
01:13:28,759 --> 01:13:31,560
We´re getting into Comanche country.

703
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,120
Wagon tracks.

704
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:40,919
But I never seen tracks like these.

705
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,640
Never heard of Comanches traveling
in two-wheeled carts.

706
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,240
Comancheros...

707
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:01,439
...trade liquor and guns
to Comanche for horses.

708
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,799
Trade women too.

709
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:05,279
How many?

710
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:08,279
Eight...

711
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:11,680
...maybe nine horses,
and a couple of carts.

712
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,879
Those poor pilgrims from IKansas.

713
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,040
They don´t look too proud now,
do they?

714
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:19,000
You son of a bitch!

715
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,359
Ten Bears is going to want
a fresh woman!

716
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,319
Fresh, that little gal will
bring maybe 20 horses.

717
01:17:29,759 --> 01:17:34,040
Now if one of you has to,
take that old woman over there.

718
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,200
She might be worth maybe one donkey.

719
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,640
Fix yourself.

720
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,000
Move faster!

721
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:22,919
If you fall...

722
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,959
...they´ll let you die.
IKeep walking.

723
01:19:32,799 --> 01:19:35,080
Come around here, bitch.
Come around here.

724
01:19:39,839 --> 01:19:41,080
Now you listen to me.

725
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:43,959
I want you looking real good
when we get to Ten Bears.

726
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:48,520
So I want you to jump in that wagon and
put on one of your best little dresses.

727
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,479
It might boost your price.

728
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:57,120
If you look good enough, I might outbid
old Ten Bears and take you for myself.

729
01:20:32,959 --> 01:20:34,759
If I figure this right...

730
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,200
...we´re facing the sun.

731
01:20:37,759 --> 01:20:40,000
This ought to give him an edge.

732
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:42,520
Who are you talking about?

733
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,240
What the hell does he want?

734
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,759
Looks like a parlay.

735
01:20:52,839 --> 01:20:56,120
Are you just going to sit there or
you going to see what he wants?

736
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,720
Get ready, little lady.

737
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,160
Hell is coming to breakfast.

738
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,040
That´s a mighty nice horse
you got there, mister.

739
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,680
Would you sell it?

740
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,600
We will give you a good price.

741
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,319
Now spit!

742
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:34,439
Just get off the horse.

743
01:21:39,919 --> 01:21:40,919
Get out of the way!

744
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,799
Now you´ll kill us, I suppose.

745
01:22:39,799 --> 01:22:43,160
I´d have been halfway to Mexico by now
except for that crazy squaw.

746
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:45,399
I can´t understand a word she says.

747
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:48,399
I knew that would bring you.

748
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:03,879
Help us!

749
01:23:07,799 --> 01:23:09,000
Help us.

750
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:10,959
Comanches.

751
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,680
They won´t like us killing friends
of theirs. We better get moving.

752
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:04,640
Looks like a family of hogs just moved
out of the seat of these britches.

753
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,959
I had such beautiful clothes...

754
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,560
...l was taking to our ranch.

755
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,520
Whereabouts is this ranch?

756
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:19,399
My son´s ranch, he found before
the war near a town called Santa Rio.

757
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,080
Creek with good water...

758
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:23,479
...trees, cattle, black-tailed deer.

759
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:27,000
It´s a regular paradise
we´re headed to.

760
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:28,720
Out there?

761
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,160
Your son told you this was out there?

762
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:35,439
He told me that.
Near a place called Blood Butte.

763
01:24:35,879 --> 01:24:38,120
My son was true-blue, Mr. Wales.

764
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:40,919
He never lied.
It´ll be there, all right.

765
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,759
Yes, ma´am, l´m sure it will be.

766
01:24:45,959 --> 01:24:49,000
Cottonwoods, live oaks...

767
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:51,439
...wild horses...

768
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,240
...antelope...

769
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,120
...lots of quail.

770
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:03,479
You see them?

771
01:25:04,919 --> 01:25:05,720
What?

772
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:08,000
The clouds over there.

773
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,439
Clouds are like...

774
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,000
...dreams floating across
a sky-blue mind.

775
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,120
I never thought of them that way.

776
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,959
Indian...

777
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:29,879
...this Mr. Wales is a
cold-blooded killer.

778
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,359
He´s from Missouri...

779
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,720
...where they´re known to be killers
of innocent men, women and children.

780
01:25:35,959 --> 01:25:38,720
Would you rather be riding with
Comancheros, Grannie?

781
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,640
No, I wouldn´t.

782
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:08,759
What´ll you have?

783
01:27:11,879 --> 01:27:13,080
Whiskey.

784
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,080
Whiskey, he says!

785
01:27:16,879 --> 01:27:18,560
How about something else?

786
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,439
Beer then.

787
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,399
And get those gents whatever
they´re drinking.

788
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,520
You too, ma´am.

789
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:30,120
That´s mighty decent of you.

790
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:33,399
Been a long time since anybody
bought a drink around here.

791
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,439
About as long as we had
anything to drink around here.

792
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,560
Or anything else.

793
01:27:39,759 --> 01:27:43,520
Yeah, first the silver run out
of the Santa Rio.

794
01:27:43,759 --> 01:27:45,839
Then the people run out.

795
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,759
Then the whiskey.

796
01:27:47,959 --> 01:27:50,040
Then the beer run out.

797
01:27:50,359 --> 01:27:51,520
Well, no matter.

798
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,080
It´s good to see a high roller
wander through.

799
01:28:08,759 --> 01:28:10,640
I didn´t mean to offend him.

800
01:28:10,879 --> 01:28:14,120
I guess some fellows just don´t like
to be called high rollers.

801
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:18,560
You know, I knew a fellow once, he
didn´t like to be called highhanded.

802
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:23,080
We´ll have whiskey all around.

803
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:25,000
Comanchero brand.

804
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,200
Angels of mercy come to Santa Rio!

805
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:36,240
This ain´t Santa Rio.

806
01:28:36,439 --> 01:28:39,120
My son, Tom Turner, said it was
a thriving place.

807
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:40,759
It was.

808
01:28:40,959 --> 01:28:44,040
But when the silver ran out,
the thriving ran out.

809
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,399
That´s right.

810
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,040
I do declare.

811
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,120
Might you be the mother
of Tom Turner...

812
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:53,240
...whose Crooked River Ranch
is over by Blood Butte?

813
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:55,279
That I might, miss.

814
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,319
I am Rose.

815
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,080
Rose of Santa Rio.

816
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:03,720
I reckon he wrote you all about me.

817
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,359
I don´t recollect that.

818
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,120
After his Lucy passed on...

819
01:29:09,319 --> 01:29:11,200
...he didn´t show much
interest in women.

820
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:16,799
My sonny-boy kept his nose to the
grindstone, making a future for me...

821
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,240
...and his daughter there.

822
01:29:21,759 --> 01:29:25,520
I do seem to recall him
telling me something about...

823
01:29:25,759 --> 01:29:28,080
...a daughter who was a little...

824
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:29,160
...odd.

825
01:29:29,919 --> 01:29:33,200
He was killed in the Border War
by Missouri ruffians.

826
01:29:33,399 --> 01:29:36,640
He died a proud member of
Senator Jim Lane´s Redlegs...

827
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,919
...fighting for the just cause!

828
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,279
I am sorry to hear that.

829
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:45,439
I mean, he was of the finest sort.

830
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:48,040
Señora, please sit down.

831
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,759
You must be very, very tired.

832
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,040
I am deeply sorrowed to hear this.

833
01:29:56,319 --> 01:29:57,839
In past years...

834
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:01,359
...my friend and I were of service
to your Tom Turner.

835
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,879
And now we are at your service.

836
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,600
Why, I appreciate your concern.

837
01:30:08,839 --> 01:30:12,120
I am glad to find manners at last,
here in the wilderness.

838
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,479
We have endured hardship of the
worst sort on the way out here.

839
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,919
Grandpa Samuel and Uncle Enoch...

840
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,720
...fell prey to Comancheros.

841
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:27,680
Let´s drink to the silver running out.
Gave us some peace and quiet here!

842
01:30:27,879 --> 01:30:29,600
Bad luck, the silver running out.

843
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,879
I wouldn´t have any other kind!

844
01:30:40,759 --> 01:30:41,759
What´ll you have?

845
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:45,319
I´m looking for Josey Wales.

846
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:49,560
That´ll be me.

847
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:54,879
You´re wanted, Wales.

848
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,240
Reckon l´m right popular.

849
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:00,799
You a bounty hunter?

850
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,879
A man´s got to do something for
a living these days.

851
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:07,359
Dying ain´t much of a living, boy.

852
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,080
You know, this isn´t necessary.

853
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,919
You can just ride on.

854
01:31:52,359 --> 01:31:53,600
I had to come back.

855
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,799
I know.

856
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,600
-Comanche?
-Comanches, all right.

857
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:40,560
Any more of them?

858
01:32:40,759 --> 01:32:42,839
I think that´s all there is...

859
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,759
...but they have horses
packing antelope...

860
01:32:45,959 --> 01:32:48,319
...so I figure they´re not
a raiding party.

861
01:32:48,839 --> 01:32:51,040
But you never can tell,
these Comanches.

862
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,640
You stay with the cart.

863
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,279
Just looking us over, I guess.

864
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,560
They´re packing heavy.

865
01:33:16,759 --> 01:33:17,879
They may return.

866
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,640
All right, let´s move out.

867
01:33:26,959 --> 01:33:29,399
If they ride with Ten Bears...

868
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,240
...they will come back.

869
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,080
Ten Bears is the greatest
Comanche war chief.

870
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:36,640
But he´s angry.

871
01:33:36,839 --> 01:33:40,120
Each year, he has met with
one of your bluecoat generals.

872
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:41,399
Ain´t my generals.

873
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,080
And each year he is pushed further
across the plains.

874
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:48,120
General Sherman has come
with more promises.

875
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:50,720
But Ten Bears will move no more.

876
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:45,040
It´s so beautiful.

877
01:34:52,759 --> 01:34:56,120
All right, we can get to work
dusting first.

878
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:01,240
Got a nice Dutch oven
in the fireplace here.

879
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:05,359
Mr. Wales, you men chop some wood.

880
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,680
Now, get everything done.

881
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,200
Mr. Wales!

882
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:14,200
Did you come all this way to gawk?

883
01:35:14,799 --> 01:35:17,200
If you don´t work,
you don´t eat around here.

884
01:35:17,399 --> 01:35:19,479
Didn´t figure you for a loafer.

885
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:46,200
You know, she told me...

886
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:50,520
...it´s the first time she ever had
a place of her own.

887
01:35:51,759 --> 01:35:54,160
Grandma says it´s our home.

888
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,720
It is all of ours.

889
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,600
I´m glad there will be a man
around to take care of things.

890
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:04,040
I´ll be dropping back
from time to time...

891
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,839
...probably just to hole up.

892
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:09,799
Why don´t you stay with us?

893
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:12,040
Be our partner.

894
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:14,680
They won´t miss you.

895
01:36:14,919 --> 01:36:17,040
Maybe they´ll forget you.

896
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,399
You know there ain´t no forgetting.

897
01:37:09,919 --> 01:37:11,040
Pa!

898
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,200
Hey, there, Josey!

899
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,279
We´re going to Santa Rio!

900
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:33,319
Lord...

901
01:38:33,879 --> 01:38:36,959
...thanks a lot for bringing us
to this place.

902
01:38:37,919 --> 01:38:39,359
Pa and Daniel died...

903
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:43,080
...at the hands of that low-down,
murdering trash out of hell...

904
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,080
...that done them in.

905
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,919
But they put up a good fight
and died the best they could.

906
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,319
And thanks a lot for Josey Wales...

907
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:55,359
...who you changed from
a murdering bushwhacker...

908
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,240
...on the side of Satan...

909
01:38:57,439 --> 01:38:58,959
...to a better man...

910
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,959
...in time to deliver us
from the Philistines.

911
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,439
And thank you, Lord, for
getting us together in Texas.

912
01:39:13,799 --> 01:39:15,359
Are you all right?

913
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,439
Ten Bears...

914
01:39:16,839 --> 01:39:18,839
...he got Travis and Chato.

915
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,439
He´ll be riding here in the morning.

916
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:42,240
If I was looking for a place
to hole up, l´d pick this one.

917
01:39:42,439 --> 01:39:44,839
Walls and ceiling, 2 feet thick.

918
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,120
All made out of mud, nothing to burn.

919
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:51,479
Two doors, front and back,
right in sight of one another.

920
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,600
These here crosses are to fire rifles
through. Up and down, side to side.

921
01:39:55,799 --> 01:39:57,680
Tom Turner knew what he was doing.

922
01:39:57,879 --> 01:40:00,120
You bet.
I´ll be shooting out that door.

923
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:02,520
I´d rather have you sit right there...

924
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:04,919
...and do the loading.
Can you do that?

925
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,479
I can.

926
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,879
Moonlight...

927
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,399
...l want you to go to this door.
You fire through here, all right?

928
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,200
Laura Lee, right through this window.
Can you shoot?

929
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:17,520
I´ll try.

930
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,839
Lone, you take this window
right over here and the door.

931
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:22,520
Where there´s the most firing.

932
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:26,680
You´ll have to keep an eye on
that hallway there because...

933
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:32,399
...the only blind spot is the ceiling.
They´ll get around to it eventually.

934
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,040
They can´t shoot through it,
but they might...

935
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:38,319
...dig a hole in it and drop down,
maybe in the back bedroom.

936
01:40:39,879 --> 01:40:41,240
Now remember...

937
01:40:41,839 --> 01:40:44,839
...when things look bad, and it looks
like you won´t make it...

938
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,560
...then you got to get mean.

939
01:40:46,759 --> 01:40:48,919
I mean plumb, mad dog mean!

940
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:53,080
Because if you lose your head and
give up, then you neither live nor win.

941
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,040
That´s just the way it is.

942
01:40:55,439 --> 01:40:59,080
Use pistols at short range.
More fire power and less reloading.

943
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:01,959
IKeep this fire going.
IKeep an iron on it red-hot.

944
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,160
Anybody gets hit, slap iron to it.

945
01:41:04,359 --> 01:41:06,640
That´s the fastest way
to stop the blood.

946
01:41:09,959 --> 01:41:11,919
What´s all that paint about?

947
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,720
It´s my death face.

948
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:18,520
You know, we´re sure going to show
them redskins something tomorrow!

949
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,120
No offense meant.

950
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:22,799
None taken.

951
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:33,879
Where´s he going?

952
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,879
He knows he can do the best for us
on the back of a horse.

953
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,560
He´s a guerrilla fighter.

954
01:41:39,959 --> 01:41:42,879
He figures he can carry the fight
to the enemy.

955
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:46,680
He´s going down into the valley
to kill Ten Bears...

956
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,399
...and as many of the men as he can.

957
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,640
How will he do that
and come back here?

958
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:54,399
He won´t come back.

959
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,240
You be Ten Bears?

960
01:44:23,919 --> 01:44:25,560
I am Ten Bears.

961
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:31,799
I´m Josey Wales.

962
01:44:33,919 --> 01:44:35,479
I have heard.

963
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,319
You´re the Gray Rider.

964
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:42,839
You would not make peace with the
bluecoats. You may go in peace.

965
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,520
I reckon not.

966
01:44:51,319 --> 01:44:52,240
Got nowhere to go.

967
01:44:52,959 --> 01:44:54,359
Then you will die.

968
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,399
I came here to die with you.

969
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:02,080
Or live with you.

970
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:06,399
Dying´s not hard for you and me.
It´s living that´s hard...

971
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:09,520
...when all you ever cared about has
been butchered or raped.

972
01:45:12,359 --> 01:45:15,160
Governments don´t live together.
People live together.

973
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:20,160
Governments don´t give you a fair word
or a fair fight. I´ve come here to...

974
01:45:20,359 --> 01:45:23,040
...give you either one.
Or get either one from you.

975
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:29,720
I came here like this so you´ll know
my word of death is true.

976
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:32,439
And that my word of life is then true.

977
01:45:35,399 --> 01:45:39,919
The bear lives here, the wolf,
the antelope, the Comanche.

978
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:42,040
And so will we.

979
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,399
We´ll only hunt what we need to
live on, same as the Comanche does.

980
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:50,399
And every spring when
the Comanche moves north...

981
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:52,080
...he can rest here in peace...

982
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:55,720
...butcher some of our cattle
and jerk beef for the journey.

983
01:45:56,319 --> 01:45:59,959
The sign of the Comanche,
that will be on our lodge.

984
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:01,319
That´s my word of life.

985
01:46:01,919 --> 01:46:03,520
And your word of death?

986
01:46:04,359 --> 01:46:07,439
It´s here in my pistols
and there in your rifles.

987
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,919
I´m here for either one.

988
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:13,439
These things you say we will have,
we already have.

989
01:46:13,919 --> 01:46:17,560
That´s true.
I ain´t promising you nothing extra.

990
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:21,120
I´m just giving you life,
and you´re giving me life.

991
01:46:21,319 --> 01:46:24,959
And l´m saying men can live together
without butchering one another.

992
01:46:27,399 --> 01:46:31,680
It´s sad that governments are chiefed
by the double-tongues.

993
01:46:31,879 --> 01:46:35,839
There is iron in your words of death
for all Comanches to see.

994
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:38,919
And so there is iron
in your words of life.

995
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,959
No signed paper can hold the iron.

996
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,120
It must come from men.

997
01:46:45,839 --> 01:46:49,919
The words of Ten Bears carry
the same iron of life and death.

998
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:54,520
It is good that warriors such as we
meet in the struggle of life...

999
01:46:54,959 --> 01:46:55,919
...or death.

1000
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,879
It shall be life.

1001
01:47:25,479 --> 01:47:26,600
So will it be.

1002
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,240
I reckon so.

1003
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,879
I´ll be damned! Look at this!

1004
01:47:44,479 --> 01:47:46,680
Come. Sit down.

1005
01:47:46,879 --> 01:47:49,479
Oh, l´m so glad to see you!

1006
01:47:54,799 --> 01:47:55,919
Sit down.

1007
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:58,080
I never been so glad to see an lndian.

1008
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:02,839
I´ve got something to show you,
Mr. Wales.

1009
01:49:04,799 --> 01:49:06,959
I made this chain for you.

1010
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:09,080
I braided it from my hair.

1011
01:49:11,799 --> 01:49:14,200
That´s real nice. It really is.

1012
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:16,160
It´s a watch chain.

1013
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:21,399
It´s a nice one. It will come
in handy. I thank you for it.

1014
01:49:23,959 --> 01:49:26,200
You do have a watch, don´t you?

1015
01:49:29,759 --> 01:49:32,120
I´ve been meaning to get one.

1016
01:49:33,959 --> 01:49:35,680
Could we...

1017
01:49:35,879 --> 01:49:37,560
...play a song for you?

1018
01:49:38,919 --> 01:49:43,200
I´m afraid I don´t really know
too many songs.

1019
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:55,439
Could we play something you like?
Come on.

1020
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,200
Only song I can think of is
"Rose of Alabama."

1021
01:49:59,839 --> 01:50:02,560
We remember that old piece.
Rosie, come here.

1022
01:50:17,959 --> 01:50:19,359
Do you dance?

1023
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:22,040
Me neither.

1024
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,600
I could see him through this
window when he shot my partner.

1025
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:35,040
He was traveling with an
old lnjun and a squaw...

1026
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:37,399
...and some old lady
and a scrawny girl.

1027
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:41,759
Had to be him. He had this scar
right on his face, right here.

1028
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:44,680
I wasn´t about to face him down alone.

1029
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:51,959
You men get them horses out of sight.

1030
01:51:54,759 --> 01:51:58,200
If Josey Wales comes back here,
we´ll buy him a drink.

1031
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,839
IKansas was all...

1032
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:45,720
...golden and smelled like sunshine.

1033
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:52,640
I always heard there were 3 kinds
of suns in IKansas.

1034
01:52:53,319 --> 01:52:54,720
Sunshine...

1035
01:52:55,399 --> 01:52:56,759
...sunflowers...

1036
01:52:56,959 --> 01:52:58,720
...and sons of bitches.

1037
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:05,600
At least that´s something.

1038
01:53:09,479 --> 01:53:11,680
I heard a joke about Missouri once.

1039
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:15,120
Something about how people
from Missouri...

1040
01:53:15,319 --> 01:53:18,080
...are always saying, "Show me."

1041
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,600
Do you know it?

1042
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:22,839
I think it was:

1043
01:53:26,359 --> 01:53:28,759
"What does a man from Missouri say...

1044
01:53:28,959 --> 01:53:32,919
...if someone asks him to see a
Missouri mule?"

1045
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:36,520
He says, "Show me."

1046
01:53:38,879 --> 01:53:40,160
Get it?

1047
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:43,359
They teach dumb jokes to
pretty girls in IKansas.

1048
01:53:45,959 --> 01:53:47,640
They teach other things.

1049
01:53:55,399 --> 01:53:56,759
Show me.

1050
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:34,080
Pa!

1051
01:55:08,359 --> 01:55:10,319
You´re up kind of early, aren´t you?

1052
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:15,080
It´s been nice riding with you.

1053
01:55:16,319 --> 01:55:17,120
Same here.

1054
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:22,200
When you get to town, get some nice
dresses for the ladies, you hear?

1055
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,120
I will.

1056
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:28,560
Get something specially nice for Laura
Lee for when I come back in the spring.

1057
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:37,680
Or the following spring.

1058
01:55:43,359 --> 01:55:46,040
Sometimes trouble just follows a man.

1059
01:55:46,959 --> 01:55:49,439
Hell, l´ve been here way
too long as it--

1060
01:55:55,879 --> 01:55:57,560
I reckon so.

1061
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:47,080
You´re all alone now, Wales.

1062
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:50,359
Not quite alone.

1063
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:32,959
Now we´re really going to show
these palefaces something!

1064
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:34,240
No offense.

1065
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:35,680
None taken.

1066
01:58:35,879 --> 01:58:39,959
These freebooters are
a slander to IKansas...

1067
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:42,919
...attacking innocent women like this.

1068
02:04:00,399 --> 02:04:01,520
The bullets were flying...

1069
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:04,600
...and people running every which way.

1070
02:04:04,799 --> 02:04:08,000
Church bells were ringing. Me and
Miss Rose were ducking for cover.

1071
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,839
Because one didn´t know where
the shots were coming--

1072
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:19,720
Mr. Wilson!

1073
02:04:20,479 --> 02:04:21,399
Good morning.

1074
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:24,080
Hello, Mr. Wilson.

1075
02:04:24,479 --> 02:04:26,479
We were just telling a little story...

1076
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:30,279
...about an outlaw passed through
this way a while back.

1077
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,600
I don´t suppose you´d know
about him but--

1078
02:04:32,799 --> 02:04:36,919
These two fellows down here is
Texas Rangers.

1079
02:04:37,319 --> 02:04:40,919
Been on his trail, along with this
other fellow over here.

1080
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:43,120
What did you say
your name was, friend?

1081
02:04:48,479 --> 02:04:49,240
Fletcher.

1082
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:52,600
That´s right, Mr. Fletcher.

1083
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,640
Anyway, they´ve been chasing
this outlaw...

1084
02:04:55,799 --> 02:04:59,879
...and it just so happens old Ten Spot
here knows all about it.

1085
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:01,520
Yes, sir.

1086
02:05:01,720 --> 02:05:05,439
It was down in Monterey, Mexico,
a little while back.

1087
02:05:05,879 --> 02:05:07,479
Anyway, this outlaw fellow...

1088
02:05:07,879 --> 02:05:10,319
...he went up against 5 pistoleros.

1089
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:13,600
He got 3 of them
before they cut him down.

1090
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:15,479
Is that right, Miss Rose?

1091
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:18,479
That´s right. His name was...

1092
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:20,720
...Josey Wales.

1093
02:05:20,919 --> 02:05:23,799
Yeah, that´s it. Josey Wales.

1094
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:29,000
If that´s what happened,
then Josey Wales must be dead.

1095
02:05:30,439 --> 02:05:31,799
He is dead.

1096
02:05:32,319 --> 02:05:35,120
He sure is dead.

1097
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:39,399
Dead, all right.

1098
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,040
Will you sign this affidavit?

1099
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:49,319
Sign? I sure will.

1100
02:06:05,279 --> 02:06:06,520
That´s it.

1101
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:16,040
Nice seeing you, Mr. Wilson.

1102
02:06:21,799 --> 02:06:24,439
Must be 5000 lawmen
in Texas right now.

1103
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:25,680
Can´t get them all.

1104
02:06:25,919 --> 02:06:27,879
I guess that´s the truth.

1105
02:06:28,759 --> 02:06:31,120
You fellows get back
up this way, stop in.

1106
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:33,879
I reckon we won´t be coming
back this way.

1107
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:42,000
I don´t believe that story
about Josey Wales.

1108
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:43,439
You don´t?

1109
02:06:43,839 --> 02:06:45,560
No, sir, I don´t.

1110
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:50,240
I don´t believe no 5 pistoleros
could do in Josey Wales.

1111
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:52,919
Maybe it was 6.

1112
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:54,560
Could have even been 10.

1113
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:57,560
I think he´s still alive.

1114
02:06:57,759 --> 02:07:00,120
Alive? No, sir.

1115
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:10,799
I think l´ll go down to Mexico
to try to find him.

1116
02:07:18,680 --> 02:07:19,720
And then?

1117
02:07:28,319 --> 02:07:30,399
He´s got the first move.

1118
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:32,520
I owe him that.

1119
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,680
I´ll try to tell him the war is over.

1120
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:53,879
What do you say?

1121
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:02,839
I reckon so.

1122
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:12,439
I guess we all died a little
in that damn war.
