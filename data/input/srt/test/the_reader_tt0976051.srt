1
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,028
You didn't wake me.

2
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,073
You were sleeping.

3
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,367
You can't bear
to have breakfast with me.

4
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,620
I've boiled you an egg. See?
I'd hardly have boiled you an egg

5
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,457
if I didn't want to see you.
Um, tea or coffee?

6
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,585
Does any woman
ever stay long enough

7
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:28,213
to find out what the hell
goes on in your head?

8
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,924
What are you doing tonight?

9
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,926
I'm seeing my daughter.

10
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,680
Your daughter?
You've kept very quiet about her.

11
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,891
Have I?

12
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:42,352
Well, she's been abroad for a year.

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,939
Did you say tea?

14
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,733
I'm going.

15
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,613
Have fun with your daughter.

16
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,146
Tickets, please.

17
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,943
Tickets. Excuse me.

18
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,241
Tickets.

19
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,621
Tickets, please.

20
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,307
Oh!

21
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,767
Hey. Hey, you!

22
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,547
Your feet. Your feet.

23
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,068
Hey, kid.

24
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,904
Up.

25
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,367
It's all right.

26
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,213
There. Where do you live?

27
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,597
It's just up here.
I'll be fine now. Thank you.

28
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,684
Goodbye.

29
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,319
Look after yourself.

30
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,162
I'm worried about him.
He looks terrible.

31
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,665
The boy's saying
he doesn't need a doctor.

32
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,667
- He does.
- I don't need a doctor.

33
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,044
- Good, then.
- Peter.

34
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,506
We're not going to argue about this.

35
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,011
Remind me.
How old are you, now?

36
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,762
Michael's 15.

37
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,682
It's scarlet fever.

38
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,685
He'll be in bed
for several months, at least.

39
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,313
Complete isolation.

40
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,608
Emily, keep away. He's contagious.

41
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,278
Emily!

42
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,963
How are you feeling?

43
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,508
Better.

44
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,260
I meant to tell you...

45
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,138
...the day I got ill, a woman helped me.

46
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,057
She helped you?

47
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,559
Yes. She brought me home.

48
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,895
Do you have her address?

49
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,226
- Hello?
- Yes?

50
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,297
I brought you these flowers
to say thank you.

51
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,591
Put them over there in the sink.

52
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,656
I would have come earlier,
I've been in bed three months.

53
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,952
- You are better now?
- Yes. Thank you.

54
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:19,500
- Have you always been weak?
- Oh, no. I've never been sick before.

55
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,795
It's incredibly boring.
There's nothing to do.

56
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,215
I couldn't even be bothered to read.

57
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,347
Well, thank you again.

58
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,017
Wait.

59
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,394
I'll walk with you.
I have to go to work.

60
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,692
Wait in the hall while I change.

61
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,530
There are two more buckets downstairs.

62
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,949
You can fill them and bring them up.

63
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,479
You look ridiculous.
Look at you, kid.

64
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,860
You can't go home like that.

65
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,326
Take off your clothes.
I'll run you a bath.

66
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,849
Do you always take
a bath in your trousers?

67
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,657
It's all right. I won't look.

68
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,184
I'll get you a towel.

69
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,997
So that's
why you came back.

70
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,642
You're so beautiful.

71
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,855
What are you talking about?

72
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,241
Look at me, kid.

73
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,953
Mm! Mm!

74
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,122
Slowly.

75
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,416
Slowly...

76
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,293
Shh.

77
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,497
You've inconvenienced your mother.

78
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,626
How many more times?
I've said I'm sorry.

79
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,920
- You scared her.
- I got lost, that's all.

80
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,339
That's why I was late.
Can I have some more?

81
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,841
How can anyone get lost
in their own hometown?

82
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,928
I meant to head for the castle,
I ended up at the field.

83
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,971
- Opposite directions.
- None of your business.

84
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:56,850
- He's lying.
- He's not lying.

85
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,602
Michael never lies.

86
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,858
I've decided I want
to go back to school tomorrow.

87
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:08,153
- The doctor says you need three weeks.
- Well, I'm going.

88
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,739
Peter?

89
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,712
- Hey!
- Ooh!

90
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:55,409
Like this?

91
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,494
That's right.

92
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,668
No, not so fast.

93
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,763
Ah!

94
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,060
It's all right.

95
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,104
Do it again.

96
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,984
Mm...

97
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,987
Oh!

98
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,880
What's your name?

99
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,758
- What?
- Your name.

100
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:58,055
- Why do you want to know?
- I've been here three times.

101
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:03,018
I want to know your name.
What's wrong with that?

102
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,229
Nothing, kid.

103
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,357
There's nothing wrong with that.

104
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,360
- It's Hanna.
- You look so suspicious.

105
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,616
- What's yours, kid?
- Michael.

106
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,161
Michael. Hmm.

107
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,497
So I'm with a Michael.

108
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,834
Hanna.

109
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:31,839
The notion of secrecy
is central to Western literature.

110
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,510
You may say the whole idea of character

111
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,847
is defined by people

112
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,683
holding specific information,

113
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,435
which, for various reasons,

114
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,398
sometimes perverse,
sometimes noble,

115
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,901
they are determined not to disclose.

116
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,251
You never tell me
what you've been studying.

117
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,003
Studying?

118
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,464
At school.

119
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:21,972
- Do you learn languages?
- Yes.

120
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,977
- What languages?
- Latin.

121
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:34,902
Say something in Latin.

122
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,076
It's Horace.

123
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,537
It's wonderful.

124
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,665
Do you want some Greek?

125
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:09,895
It's beautiful.

126
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,481
How can you tell?

127
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:15,943
How do you know,
when you've no idea what it means?

128
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,365
What are you studying in German?

129
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,783
I'm studying a play.

130
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:28,539
By a writer called Gotthold
Ephraim Lessing. You heard of him?

131
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:33,210
The play's called Emilia Galotti.
You can read it.

132
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,879
I'd rather listen to you.

133
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,714
All right.

134
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,977
"Act One. Scene One.

135
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,272
The setting:
one of the prince's chambers.

136
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,899
The Prince... "

137
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,652
I'm not very good.

138
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,070
Go on.

139
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,909
"Complaints, nothing but complaints.

140
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:10,956
For goodness sake,
is there anything left but work?

141
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,293
Just imagine that
people actually envy us. "

142
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,338
You're good at it, aren't you?

143
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,926
Good at what?

144
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,723
Reading.

145
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,437
What's funny?

146
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,983
I didn't think I was good at anything.

147
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:52,456
Whoo!

148
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:09,158
What are you doing?
What is this?

149
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,451
Why did you behave
as if you didn't know me?

150
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:15,497
You didn't want to know me! You could
see I was in the first carriage!

151
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:19,001
- So why did you sit in the second?
- What did you think I was doing?

152
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,712
- Why did you think I was there?
- How should I know?

153
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:25,507
Now, I've been working.
I need a bath.

154
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:27,885
And I'd like to be by myself.

155
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,553
Would you please leave?!

156
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,352
I... I didn't mean to upset you.

157
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:42,858
You don't have the power to upset me.

158
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,068
You don't matter enough to upset me.

159
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,731
I don't know what to say.

160
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,319
I've never been with a woman before.

161
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:16,326
We've been together four weeks,

162
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,912
and I can't live without you.

163
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:21,373
I can't.

164
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,709
Even the thought of it kills me.

165
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,218
I sat in the second carriage
because I thought you might kiss me.

166
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:37,556
Kid, you thought
we could make love in a tram?

167
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,898
Is it true what you said?

168
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:47,774
That I don't matter to you?

169
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,248
Do you forgive me?

170
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:10,547
Do you love me?

171
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,528
- Do you have a book?
- Yes, I have.

172
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,404
I took one with me this morning.

173
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:39,284
- What is it?
- The Odyssey, by Homer.

174
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,203
It's my homework.

175
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,458
We're changing the order we do things.

176
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:50,379
Read to me first, kid.
Then we make love.

177
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:59,847
- The Odyssey, by Homer.
- What's an odyssey?

178
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,765
A journey.
He sets out on a journey.

179
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:03,767
Good.

180
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:11,984
"Sing to me of the man, Muse
The man of twists and turns

181
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,320
Driven time and again off course
Once he had plundered

182
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:18,365
- The hallowed heights of Troy"
- Come here.

183
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:28,375
"He pressed
her hand to his lips.

184
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,045
She was dead.

185
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:35,507
Past all help, or need of it. "

186
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:46,852
"I poked into the place a
ways, encountered a little open patch

187
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:50,397
as big as a bedroom,
all hung around with vines,

188
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,399
and found a man lying there asleep.

189
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:56,820
And, by jings, it was my old Jim.

190
00:28:56,904 --> 00:29:00,365
'When you landed,
I reckoned I could catch up with you

191
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:04,244
on the land without having to shout
at you. But when I see that house,

192
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,079
I begin to go slow. "

193
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:10,918
"Lady Chatterley
felt his naked flesh against her

194
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:14,213
as he came into her.

195
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:16,548
For a moment,
he was still inside her...

196
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:18,634
This is disgusting.

197
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:22,387
Where did you get this?

198
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,307
- I borrowed it from someone at school.
- Oh...

199
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,226
You should be ashamed.

200
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:32,397
Go on.

201
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:37,611
"'Billions of bilious blue blistering
barnacles in a thundering typhoon!

202
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:41,281
It is water!' 'But what on earth
did you expect it to be?"'

203
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:45,619
- Whiskey.
- "'Whiskey, by thunder, whiskey!'

204
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:49,122
'Whiskey? Come now, captain,
you can't be serious. "

205
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:52,334
That's enough for today, kid.

206
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:56,171
I was wondering, do you think
you could get some time off?

207
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,799
Maybe we could go on a trip.

208
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:02,052
- What sort of trip?
- A cycling holiday.

209
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,096
Just two days.

210
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,103
I've got a guide book.
I've worked out the route.

211
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:14,773
Look. What do you think?

212
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,654
I think you like planning, don't you?

213
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,673
"I'm not frightened.

214
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,675
I'm not frightened of anything.

215
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:48,432
The more I suffer, the more I love.

216
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,268
Danger will only increase my love.

217
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:54,855
It will sharpen it.
It will give it spice.

218
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,400
I'll be the only angel you need.

219
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:03,280
You will leave life even more beautiful
than you entered it.

220
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:07,034
Heaven will take you back
and look at you and say,

221
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:12,956
'Only one thing can make a soul
complete, and that thing is love. "

222
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:41,276
- Hello.
- Hello.

223
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,160
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

224
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,330
Do you know what you'd like?

225
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,919
- Um...
- What are you having?

226
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,881
- You order. I'll have what you have.
- OK.

227
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,591
Um...

228
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:09,596
Two frankfurters, two potato salads
and two beers, please.

229
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:20,732
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

230
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:24,111
- I hope your mother was happy.
- Thank you.

231
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,363
She enjoyed her meal very much.

232
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:43,380
Come on.

233
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:03,483
Here, let me show you
where we're going.

234
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:06,361
It's OK, kid.

235
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,031
I don't want to know.

236
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:03,187
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing a poem. About you.

237
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:09,109
- Can I hear it?
- It's not ready.

238
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,653
I'll read it to you one day.

239
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,649
- Morning, Hendrick.
- Good morning, Mr. Berg.

240
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:33,026
- You're in court 306.
- Thank you.

241
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,945
- You all right, Michael?
- I'm fine.

242
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:38,031
- Hurry. You know what she's like.
- See you later!

243
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,783
Good luck.

244
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,287
Please stand.

245
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,626
Please sit down.

246
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:56,216
The defendant, please.

247
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:08,437
They're coming.

248
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:17,404
- Hello.
- Hello.

249
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:20,240
- What did she say?
- Good morning, ladies.

250
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:24,453
Welcome your new fellow-students.
Treat them with courtesy.

251
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:27,247
- Sit down.
- Hello.

252
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,919
- My name's Sophie.
- I'm Michael.

253
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,921
The Odyssey.

254
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:35,839
Take our your books.

255
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,970
Everyone believes
Homer's subject is homecoming.

256
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:45,057
In fact, The Odyssey
is a book about a journey.

257
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,935
Home is a place you dream of.

258
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:52,105
Berg, I don't mean to distract you, but
we're meant to study Homer, not Sophie.

259
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:03,450
- It's wonderful, isn't it?
- Wonderful.

260
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,035
It's gonna be a great summer.

261
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:22,010
- Why do you leave early?
- He always leaves early.

262
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:25,347
- Do you have somewhere to go?
- See you tomorrow.

263
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,899
Sorry I'm late.

264
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,945
I got held up at school.

265
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,657
I have a new book.

266
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,910
The Lady with a Little Dog.

267
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:50,789
By Anton Chekhov.

268
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:54,168
"The talk was that a new face
had appeared on the promenade,

269
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:56,420
a lady with a little dog. "

270
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,602
Schmitz, one moment, please.

271
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:17,149
I read the reports on you.
Every single one. Excellent work.

272
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,818
You'll be working in the office.

273
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:23,280
You got promoted. Congratulations.

274
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:34,416
- Yee-haw!
- Ah!

275
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,710
Let's get out of here!

276
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:40,088
Come on! Michael, we're leaving.
Let's go!

277
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:41,298
Come on, Michael!

278
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:44,426
It's meant to be a surprise
for your birthday.

279
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:50,182
- Come on!
- What's the matter?

280
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:53,393
- I'm sorry. Really.
- We thought you'd like it.

281
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:55,687
We've got beer!
We're gonna dance!

282
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:57,773
I promised someone.

283
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:00,901
Michael, please!

284
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,660
"Here and there the reflection
of the stars and the lights,

285
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:12,120
on the bank quivered and trembled. "

286
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:14,915
- Oh, kid, kid.
- What?

287
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,876
- Stop.
- What's wrong now?

288
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,504
Nothing's wrong.

289
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:24,842
It's nothing.

290
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:30,347
You know, you never ask.

291
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:33,976
You never bother to ask how I am!

292
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,727
You never say.

293
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,856
It just happens to be my birthday.

294
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:43,443
It's my birthday, that's all!

295
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,404
You've never
even asked when it is.

296
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:48,157
- If you want a fight, kid...
- I don't want a fight!

297
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,827
- What's wrong with you?!
- What business is it of yours?!

298
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,289
It's always on your terms.
Everything.

299
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:58,083
We do what you want.
It's always what you want.

300
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,961
- My friends were giving me a party.
- Why are you here?

301
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:04,715
Go back to your party.
Is that what you want?

302
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,219
Mm! Mm!

303
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,326
It's always me
that has to apologize.

304
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:36,705
You don't have to apologize.
No one has to apologize.

305
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,132
War and Peace, kid.

306
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,740
Now, you must go
back to your friends.

307
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:51,924
Are you all right?

308
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:24,433
It's him.

309
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:30,522
Good.

310
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:32,900
Get the boy something to eat.

311
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:45,496
I think we all knew you'd
come back to us eventually.

312
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:57,734
Mr. Berg? It is 8:00.

313
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:59,570
Your daughter.

314
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,324
Thank you.

315
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:08,829
Julia.

316
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:14,001
- I've not kept you waiting?
- I was early.

317
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,295
Welcome back.

318
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:22,176
So how will you decide?

319
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:25,053
I don't know.

320
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:27,014
I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose.

321
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:29,266
- You've seen your mother?
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:31,977
I wanted to get away. That's all.

323
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,479
It was Paris,
but it could have been anywhere.

324
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:37,024
Away from your parents?

325
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:41,320
I'm aware I was difficult.

326
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:44,990
I wasn't always open with you.

327
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:50,829
I'm not open with anyone.

328
00:47:57,336 --> 00:47:58,921
I knew you were distant.

329
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:05,719
You know...
I always assumed it was my fault.

330
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:09,556
Julia.

331
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,391
How wrong can you be?

332
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:26,031
- I'll see you very soon.
- See you soon.

333
00:48:28,784 --> 00:48:31,328
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

334
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:41,713
Those of you
for the special seminar group,

335
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:43,090
please stay on in this room.

336
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:43,924
please stay on in this room...

337
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,760
Professor Rohl will
be here in a moment.

338
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:22,296
Well, we seem
to be quite a small group.

339
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:26,091
A small group and a select one.

340
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:29,469
Clearly, this is going
to be a unique seminar.

341
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:34,099
We are going to start
with a reading list, gentlemen.

342
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:36,685
Karl Jaspers...

343
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:41,064
- And ladies.
- ... The Question of German Guilt.

344
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:45,068
Creation: Making Time

345
00:49:57,623 --> 00:50:00,626
So this is where you are.

346
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:02,252
Yes.

347
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:05,506
Come in.

348
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:11,345
- You take work seriously.
- I don't know.

349
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,847
You're rather a serious boy.

350
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:16,016
It's how I was brought up.

351
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:20,687
What about you? Are you serious?

352
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:26,026
You're sure you want to work tonight?

353
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:28,737
Yeah.

354
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:32,115
But I won't work every night.

355
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:34,827
See you tomorrow.

356
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:43,919
- Yes. Exactly
- That's right.

357
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:50,551
You need a hand.

358
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:19,580
- Why all the police?
- They're worried about demonstrators.

359
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,499
- For or against?
- Both.

360
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:29,464
Wow. It's a circus.

361
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:34,636
All rise.

362
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:39,600
All photographers
are now asked to leave.

363
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:43,812
This court is now in session.
Please sit down.

364
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:49,818
First thing I'm going to do
is hear motions

365
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:52,112
from each of the defendants' lawyers.

366
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:55,991
They're arguing that there's
no reason to keep the defendants in jail

367
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:58,785
until the outcome
of the forthcoming trial.

368
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:01,497
- I'll take these cases one by one.
- Want a pen?

369
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,875
- I got a pen.
- Hanna Schmitz.

370
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:10,297
- Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
- Yes.

371
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,758
Can you speak louder please?

372
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:15,886
- My name is Hanna Schmitz.
- Thank you.

373
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:21,808
- You were born on October 21st, 1922?
- Yes.

374
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:23,685
At Hermannstadt.

375
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:28,106
- And you're now 43 years old?
- Yes.

376
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:33,278
- You joined the SS in 1943?
- Yes.

377
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:35,906
What was your
reason for joining?

378
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:40,744
You were working
at the Siemens factory at the time?

379
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:41,912
Yes.

380
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:44,581
You'd recently
been offered a promotion.

381
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:46,500
Why did you prefer to join the SS?

382
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:49,837
- Objection.
- I'll re-phrase my question.

383
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,506
I'm trying to ascertain

384
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:55,676
if she joined the SS freely, hmm?

385
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:57,177
Of her own free will.

386
00:52:58,762 --> 00:53:02,349
- I heard there were jobs.
- Go on.

387
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:05,227
I was working at Siemens

388
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:08,564
when I heard the SS was recruiting.

389
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:12,526
Did you know the kind of work
you'd be expected to do?

390
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:16,196
They were looking for guards.

391
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,534
- I applied for a job.
- You worked first at Auschwitz?

392
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:23,871
- Yes.
- Until 1944.

393
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:28,542
Then you were moved to
a smaller camp near Krakow?

394
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,210
- Yes.
- Are you OK?

395
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:33,046
- You helped move prisoners...
- I'm fine.

396
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,592
...west in the winter of 1944
in the so-called death marches?

397
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:01,533
- So, what did you think?
- I don't know.

398
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:04,745
It wasn't quite what I was expecting.

399
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:09,082
Wasn't it? In what way?
What were you expecting?

400
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,502
I thought it was exciting.

401
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:14,087
Exciting? Why?

402
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,590
Why did you think it was exciting?

403
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:18,425
Because it's justice.

404
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:53,168
Societies think they operate
by something called morality,

405
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:54,753
but they don't.

406
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:59,174
They operate by something called law.

407
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:04,888
You're not guilty of anything
merely by working at Auschwitz.

408
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:08,225
Eight thousand people
worked at Auschwitz.

409
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:13,814
Precisely 19 have been convicted,
and only six for murder.

410
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:18,819
To prove murder,
you have to prove intent.

411
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,737
That's the law.

412
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:24,533
The question is never was it wrong,

413
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:27,494
but was it legal.

414
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:32,332
And not by our laws, no.

415
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:36,503
- By the laws at the time.
- But isn't that...

416
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:39,089
- What?
- ... narrow?

417
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:43,051
Oh, yes. The law is narrow.

418
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:46,180
On the other hand,

419
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:49,725
I suspect people who kill other people

420
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:53,437
tend to be aware that it's wrong.

421
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:55,272
Miss Schmitz,
you're familiar with this book?

422
00:55:55,273 --> 00:55:58,942
Miss Schmitz,
you're familiar with this book?!

423
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:03,322
- Yes.
- Parts of it

424
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:05,866
have already been
read out in court.

425
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:08,535
It's by a survivor,

426
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:10,537
a prisoner who survived.

427
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:13,332
Ilana Mather.

428
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:16,043
She was in the camp
when she was a child, wasn't she?

429
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:18,837
- She was with her mother.
- Yes.

430
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:23,217
In the book,
she describes a selection process.

431
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,345
At the end of the month's labor,
every month,

432
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:29,473
sixty inmates were selected.

433
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:33,060
Picked out to be sent from
the satellite camp back to Auschwitz.

434
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:35,062
That's right, isn't it?

435
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,649
Yes, that's right.

436
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:42,110
And, so far,
each of your fellow defendants

437
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:44,988
has specifically denied
being part of that process.

438
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:49,034
Now, I'm going to ask you.

439
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:50,494
Were you part of it?

440
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:54,039
Yes.

441
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:01,213
So you helped make the selection?

442
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:04,299
- Yes.
- You admit that?

443
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,933
Then tell me,

444
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,435
how did that selection happen?

445
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,188
There were six guards,

446
00:57:18,272 --> 00:57:22,901
so we decided we'd
choose ten people each.

447
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:27,114
That's how we did it every month.

448
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:29,449
We'd all choose ten.

449
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,244
Your fellow defendants
took part in the process?

450
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:35,080
We all did.

451
00:57:35,164 --> 00:57:37,791
Even though they've denied it?

452
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:41,628
Saying "we," "we all"
is easier than saying "I," "I alone,"

453
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:43,380
isn't it, Miss Schmitz?

454
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:48,051
Did you not realize

455
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:50,971
that you were sending
these women to their deaths?

456
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:54,683
But they were new arrivals,
new women were arriving all the time.

457
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:59,480
So... the old ones had to make room
for the new ones.

458
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:04,234
- I'm not sure you understand...
- We couldn't keep everyone.

459
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:06,737
- There wasn't room.
- No.

460
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,740
But what I'm saying...

461
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:12,576
Let me rephrase.

462
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:15,496
To make room, you were
picking women out and saying,

463
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:20,167
"You, you and you have
to be sent back to be killed. "

464
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,711
Well, what would you have done?

465
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:35,724
Should I never
have signed up at Siemens?

466
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:51,782
Ms. Mather,
they're ready for you now.

467
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:56,787
Go, go. Go, go, go.

468
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:10,968
- Where's Michael?
- I don't know.

469
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:16,890
In your book, you describe
the process of selection.

470
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,559
Yes.

471
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:22,563
You were made to work and then,
when you were no longer any use to them,

472
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:26,066
then they sent you back
to Auschwitz to be killed.

473
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,027
Are there people here
who made that selection?

474
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:30,946
Yes.

475
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:36,493
I need you to identify them.
Can you please point them out?

476
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:50,883
Her.

477
00:59:54,386 --> 00:59:55,762
And her.

478
00:59:58,307 --> 00:59:59,766
Her.

479
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:04,146
And her.

480
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:08,066
Her.

481
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:11,862
And her.

482
01:00:13,489 --> 01:00:16,366
Thank you. Please continue.

483
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,995
Each of the guards would choose
a certain number of women.

484
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:22,247
Hanna Schmitz chose differently.

485
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:24,875
In what way differently?

486
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:31,715
She had favorites.

487
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:35,093
Girls, mostly young.

488
01:00:35,177 --> 01:00:37,971
We all remarked on it.

489
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:41,266
She gave them food
and places to sleep.

490
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:45,938
In the evening,
she... she asked them to join her.

491
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:47,606
And we all thought...

492
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:50,692
Well, you can imagine
what we thought.

493
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:56,406
And then we found out she was making
these women read aloud to her.

494
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:01,245
They were reading to her.

495
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:07,000
At first, we thought this guard,
this guard is...

496
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:11,880
...more sensitive,
she's more human, she's kinder.

497
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:16,176
Often, she chose the weak, the sick.

498
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:21,223
She picked them out.
She seemed to be protecting them almost.

499
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:23,892
But then she dispatched them.

500
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:28,939
Is that kinder?

501
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,909
I want to
move on now to the march.

502
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:45,038
As I understand it, you and your
daughter were marched for many months.

503
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:49,293
In the winter of 1944,
our camp was closed down.

504
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:54,381
We were told we had to move on.
But the plan kept changing every day.

505
01:01:54,464 --> 01:01:58,218
Women were dying
all around us in the snow.

506
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:02,890
Half of us died on the march.
My daughter says in the book,

507
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:06,268
"Less a death march,
more a death gallop. "

508
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:12,024
Please tell us about
the night in the church.

509
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:24,495
That night, we thought we were lucky
because we had a roof over our heads.

510
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:27,414
Go on.

511
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:30,584
We'd arrived in a village.

512
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:35,130
As always, the guards took the best
quarters. They took the priest's house.

513
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:38,675
But they let us sleep in a church.

514
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:42,262
There was a bombing raid
in the middle of the night.

515
01:02:42,346 --> 01:02:44,515
The church was hit.

516
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:49,895
At first, we could only hear the fire.
It was in the steeple.

517
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,733
Then we could see burning beams...

518
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,904
...and they began to crash to the floor.

519
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:03,700
Everyone rushed...

520
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:08,080
...rushed to the doors.

521
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:13,961
But the doors had been
locked on the outside.

522
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:18,382
The church burned down?
Nobody came to open the doors?

523
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:21,385
Is that right?

524
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:23,428
Nobody.

525
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:26,723
Even though you
were all burning to death?

526
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:31,937
How many people were killed?

527
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,065
Everyone was killed.

528
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:39,444
But you survived?

529
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:49,037
Thank you.

530
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:54,835
I want to thank you
for coming to this country

531
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:57,087
today to testify.

532
01:04:01,258 --> 01:04:05,512
I don't know. I don't know
what we're doing here anymore.

533
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:07,931
Don't you?

534
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:09,933
You tell us to think like lawyers,

535
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:14,062
but there's something...
disgusting about this.

536
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:16,523
- How so?
- This didn't happen to the Germans.

537
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:18,775
It happened to the Jews.

538
01:04:19,568 --> 01:04:22,946
- What are we trying to do?
- We're trying to understand.

539
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:26,033
Six women locked 300 Jews in a church
and let them burn.

540
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:28,327
What is there to understand?

541
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:34,458
Tell me! I'm asking!
What is there to understand?

542
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:40,881
I started out believing in this trial.
I thought it was great.

543
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:44,301
Now, I think it's...
it's just a diversion.

544
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:47,221
Yes? Diversion from what?

545
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:50,307
You choose six women,
you put them on trial,

546
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,644
you say, "They were the evil ones,
they were the guilty ones. "

547
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:56,230
One of the victims
happened to write a book.

548
01:04:56,313 --> 01:04:59,399
That's why they're on trial
and nobody else!

549
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:02,736
Do you know how many camps
there were in Europe?

550
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,239
People go on about
how much did everyone know?

551
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:09,201
Who knew? What did they know?
Everyone knew!

552
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:13,914
Our parents, our teachers.
That isn't the question!

553
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:16,083
The question is,
"How'd you let this happen?"

554
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:19,294
Better, "Why didn't you
kill yourself when you found out?"

555
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:25,467
Thousands. That's how many.
There were thousands of camps.

556
01:05:25,551 --> 01:05:27,469
Everyone knew.

557
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:37,354
Look at that woman.

558
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:42,860
- Which woman?
- The woman you're always staring at.

559
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:44,403
I'm sorry, but you are.

560
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:55,330
I don't know which woman you mean.

561
01:05:56,832 --> 01:05:58,667
You know what I'd do?

562
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:04,798
Put the gun in my hand,
I'd shoot her myself.

563
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:10,012
Shoot them all!

564
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:07,898
Why did you
not unlock the doors?

565
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:12,736
Why did you not unlock the doors.?

566
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:18,951
I've asked all of you,
and I'm getting no answer.

567
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:23,497
Two of the victims are in this court.
They deserve an answer.

568
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:30,295
This is the SS report.
You all have copies.

569
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:35,342
The report which was written,
approved and signed by all of you

570
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:38,971
immediately after the event.
In the written report,

571
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:43,767
you all claim you didn't even know
about the fire until after it happened.

572
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:46,145
But that isn't true, is it?

573
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:48,939
Well?

574
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,608
It's not true.

575
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:59,741
- I don't know what you're asking.
- The first thing I'm asking

576
01:09:59,825 --> 01:10:03,620
- is why didn't you unlock the doors?
- Obviously.

577
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:05,706
For the obvious reason.

578
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:09,001
- We couldn't.
- Why couldn't you?

579
01:10:09,084 --> 01:10:11,920
We were guards.

580
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:15,507
Our job was to guard the prisoners.

581
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,885
We couldn't just let them escape.

582
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:21,221
I see. And if they escaped,
then you'd be blamed,

583
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:23,724
you'd be charged,
you might even be executed?

584
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:25,893
- No!
- Well, then?

585
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:29,229
If we'd opened the doors,
there would have been chaos.

586
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:32,065
How could we have restored order?

587
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:35,277
It happened so fast.
It was snowing. The bombs.

588
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,530
The flames... There were flames
all over the village.

589
01:10:38,614 --> 01:10:41,742
Then the screaming began,
and got worse and worse.

590
01:10:41,825 --> 01:10:45,245
If they'd all come rushing out,
we couldn't just let them escape.

591
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:49,500
We couldn't.
We were responsible for them!

592
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:56,757
So you did know what was happening?
You did know? You made a choice.

593
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,551
You let them die,

594
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:02,304
rather than risk letting them escape.

595
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:08,602
The other defendants have made
an allegation against you.

596
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:10,437
Have you heard this allegation?

597
01:11:11,688 --> 01:11:14,775
They say you were in charge.

598
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:17,861
It isn't true.
I was... I was just one of the guards.

599
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:20,405
- She was in charge.
- She was!

600
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:22,950
- Of course she was.
- Did you write the report?

601
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:27,830
No. No. We all discussed what to say.
We all wrote it together.

602
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:30,165
She wrote the report.
She was in charge.

603
01:11:30,249 --> 01:11:31,625
- Is that true?
- No.

604
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,460
- Yes, you did!
- Does it matter?

605
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:35,671
- She wrote it.
- I need a sample

606
01:11:35,754 --> 01:11:39,883
- of your handwriting.
- My...

607
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:42,302
- My handwriting?
- Yes. I need to establish

608
01:11:42,386 --> 01:11:45,556
- who wrote the report.
- I don't see how that's appropriate.

609
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:48,809
- 20 years have gone by.
- Take her paper. Approach the bench.

610
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:52,396
- Compare handwriting of 20 years...?
- Approach the bench.

611
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:59,903
I will not be overruled
in my own court.

612
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:02,197
I'm sorry...

613
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:11,540
I'd rather listen to you.

614
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:33,437
There's no need.

615
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:39,193
I wrote the report.

616
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:55,542
Silence, please.

617
01:12:56,835 --> 01:12:57,961
Order!

618
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:13,185
You've been skipping seminars.

619
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,169
I have a piece of information.

620
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:42,130
Concerning one of the defendants.

621
01:13:42,214 --> 01:13:45,217
- Something they're not admitting.
- What information?

622
01:13:54,143 --> 01:13:56,019
You don't need me to tell you.

623
01:13:56,103 --> 01:14:01,191
It's perfectly clear. You have a moral
obligation to disclose it to the court.

624
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:05,028
It happens this information
is favorable to the defendant.

625
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:07,447
It can help her case.

626
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:11,285
It may even affect the outcome,
certainly the sentencing.

627
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:15,789
- So?
- There's a problem.

628
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:19,877
The defendant herself is determined
to keep this information secret.

629
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:25,799
- A moment, please.
- Sorry.

630
01:14:34,057 --> 01:14:36,393
What are her reasons?

631
01:14:38,812 --> 01:14:40,939
Because she's ashamed.

632
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:44,401
Ashamed of what?

633
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:53,535
- Have you spoken to her?
- Of course not.

634
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:56,997
Why "of course not?"

635
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,582
I can't.

636
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,836
I can't do that.

637
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,796
I can't talk to her.

638
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,843
What we feel isn't important.
It's utterly unimportant.

639
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:12,304
The only question is what we do.

640
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:18,977
If people like you don't learn
from what happened to people like me,

641
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:22,356
then what the hell
is the point of anything?

642
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:33,033
Schmitz?

643
01:15:33,116 --> 01:15:35,327
You have a visitor.

644
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:50,509
Quiet, please!

645
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:53,720
Gertrud Ballow.

646
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:58,183
Andreas Michael Springer.

647
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:03,147
Michael Berg.

648
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:08,986
Walter Sherman.

649
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:44,998
Time's up.

650
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:06,186
Are you coming in?

651
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:18,240
You took your time.

652
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:41,805
What is it?

653
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:06,955
Where are you going?

654
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:09,583
I'm sorry.

655
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,543
I need to sleep by myself.

656
01:19:57,381 --> 01:19:59,216
I'll just be a minute.

657
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:30,789
- Nazi!
- Nazi whore!

658
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:33,709
Nazi!

659
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:46,680
Silence in the court.
Silence in the court

660
01:20:46,763 --> 01:20:48,765
All rise.

661
01:20:55,105 --> 01:20:58,025
The court
finds guilty the defendants

662
01:20:58,108 --> 01:21:00,777
Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,

663
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:03,322
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva

664
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:05,657
and Andrea Lumen

665
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:10,662
of jointly aiding and abetting murder
in 300 cases.

666
01:21:10,746 --> 01:21:13,582
The court finds guilty the defendant

667
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:18,337
Hanna Schmitz of murder in 300 cases.

668
01:21:22,633 --> 01:21:25,719
The court sentences
the accused as follows:

669
01:21:25,803 --> 01:21:28,889
Rita Beckhart, Caroline Steinhoff,

670
01:21:28,972 --> 01:21:33,727
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva
and Andrea Lumen

671
01:21:33,811 --> 01:21:39,149
to each serve a total sentence in prison
of four years and three months.

672
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:41,527
Hanna Schmitz,

673
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:45,322
in view of your own admissions
and your special role,

674
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:48,408
you're in a different category.

675
01:21:48,492 --> 01:21:53,705
The court sentences the accused,
Schmitz, to imprisonment for life.

676
01:22:26,572 --> 01:22:28,490
Where are we going?

677
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:31,493
I said I'll tell you when we get there.

678
01:22:31,577 --> 01:22:36,206
- You told me you liked surprises.
- I like surprises.

679
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:56,185
She's grown, hasn't she?

680
01:22:57,936 --> 01:23:01,732
I don't know. It's so long since
I saw her, Michael. How can I tell?

681
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:08,280
It's my fault.
We shouldn't have come unannounced.

682
01:23:08,363 --> 01:23:11,533
Daddy's going to live
in his own house.

683
01:23:14,703 --> 01:23:17,915
Mother, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

684
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:21,001
Julia knows.
We've already told her.

685
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:23,253
Gertrud and I,
we are getting a divorce.

686
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:27,382
You don't come for your father's
funeral, but you come for this?

687
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:31,845
It's not easy
for me to visit this town.

688
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:35,057
- Were you really so unhappy?
- That's not what I'm saying.

689
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,601
- It's not what I meant.
- Well, then?

690
01:23:39,978 --> 01:23:44,316
You mustn't worry about Gertrud.
I'm going to look after her.

691
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,695
She's already a state prosecutor,
so she earns far more than I do.

692
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,405
Michael...

693
01:23:52,115 --> 01:23:55,035
...I'm not worried about Gertrud.

694
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:56,745
I'm worried about you.

Shades of famous heroes,
men who died in the old days

"Come, sheathe your sword,
let's go to bed together.

Mount my bed and mix
in the magic work of love.

We'll breed deep trust between us. "

you consent to swear, goddess,

"Straightaway, she began
to swear the oath that I required.

Never, she would never do me harm.

and out through the gates
and echoing colonnade,

727

they whipped the team
to a run and on they flew,

740
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:46,451
At one time you only had to say
to your sleigh driver in Moscow,

'Zhivago's. And,

Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov
had already spent two weeks in Yalta,

Sitting in the pavilion at Vernet,

walking on the seafront.

of medium height, wearing a beret... "

Do you have
The Lady with the Little Dog?

Thank you for calling me.
You got my letter?

I have it here.

769
01:34:06,146 --> 01:34:10,067
As I say, Hanna Schmitz
is coming up for release very soon.

770
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:14,196
Hanna has been in prison
for over 20 years.

771
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:15,322
She has no family.

772
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:18,283
She has no friends.

773
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:20,828
You're her only contact.

774
01:34:20,911 --> 01:34:24,164
And I'm told you don't visit her.

775
01:34:24,248 --> 01:34:25,958
No, I don't.

776
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:28,377
When she gets out,
she's going to need a job.

777
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,838
She's going to need somewhere to live.

778
01:34:30,921 --> 01:34:35,217
You can't imagine how frightening
the modern world will seem to her.

779
01:34:38,637 --> 01:34:39,721
Mm-hmm.

780
01:34:43,433 --> 01:34:45,018
I have no one else to ask.

781
01:34:46,395 --> 01:34:49,273
If you don't take
responsibility for her,

782
01:34:49,356 --> 01:34:51,984
then Hanna has no future at all.

783
01:34:55,404 --> 01:34:57,573
It's kind of you.

784
01:34:57,656 --> 01:34:59,950
Thank you for letting me know.

785
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:45,496
- You're Michael Berg?
- Yes.

786
01:35:45,579 --> 01:35:47,539
I'm Louisa Brenner. Good morning.

787
01:35:47,623 --> 01:35:51,043
- How do you do?
- We were expecting you earlier.

788
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:55,214
I should warn you, for a long time
Hanna held herself together.

789
01:35:55,297 --> 01:35:59,301
She was very purposeful. In the
last few years, she's different.

790
01:35:59,384 --> 01:36:01,595
She's let herself go.

791
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,684
I'm taking you straight to the canteen.

792
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:11,188
They've just finished their lunch.

793
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,202
Table four.

794
01:37:10,706 --> 01:37:13,041
You've grown up, kid.

795
01:37:27,389 --> 01:37:29,391
I've got a friend who's a tailor.

796
01:37:32,561 --> 01:37:33,937
He'll give you a job.

797
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:39,276
And I've found you somewhere to live.
It's a nice place.

798
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:40,944
Quite small, but it's nice.

799
01:37:42,529 --> 01:37:44,948
- You'll like it.
- Thank you.

800
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:51,830
There are various social programs,
cultural stuff I can sign you up for.

801
01:37:51,914 --> 01:37:54,625
And the public library is very close.

802
01:38:01,089 --> 01:38:02,382
You read a lot?

803
01:38:05,302 --> 01:38:07,971
I prefer being read to.

804
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:14,478
That's over now, isn't it?

805
01:38:24,154 --> 01:38:26,240
Did you get married?

806
01:38:26,323 --> 01:38:29,409
I did. Yes, I did.

807
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:31,578
We have a daughter.

808
01:38:31,662 --> 01:38:35,082
I'm not seeing as much of her
as I'd like.

809
01:38:35,165 --> 01:38:37,668
I'd like to see
a great deal more of her.

810
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,005
The marriage didn't last.

811
01:38:57,437 --> 01:38:59,898
Have you spent time
thinking about the past?

812
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:03,777
- You mean with you?
- No.

813
01:39:03,861 --> 01:39:07,573
No, I didn't mean with me.

814
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,794
Before the trial,
I never thought about the past.

815
01:39:20,878 --> 01:39:23,046
I never had to.

816
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:25,382
Now?

817
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:28,093
What do you feel now?

818
01:39:29,845 --> 01:39:32,181
It doesn't matter what I feel.

819
01:39:33,182 --> 01:39:35,309
It doesn't matter what I think.

820
01:39:37,394 --> 01:39:39,229
The dead are still dead.

821
01:39:46,737 --> 01:39:48,655
I wasn't sure what you'd learned.

822
01:39:48,739 --> 01:39:52,576
Well, I have learned, kid.

823
01:39:52,659 --> 01:39:55,078
I've learned to read.

824
01:40:08,926 --> 01:40:10,552
I'll pick you up next week, OK?

825
01:40:19,937 --> 01:40:21,897
That sounds a good plan.

826
01:40:24,566 --> 01:40:28,195
We can do it quietly,
or we can make a fuss.

827
01:40:28,278 --> 01:40:30,155
Quietly.

828
01:40:32,157 --> 01:40:34,409
OK. Quietly.

829
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:38,997
Quietly.

830
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:51,635
- Take care, kid.
- You, too. See you next week.

831
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:06,854
I've come to collect Hanna Schmitz.

832
01:43:10,774 --> 01:43:14,027
Please. Please, take a seat.

833
01:43:39,303 --> 01:43:41,930
She didn't pack.

834
01:43:42,014 --> 01:43:44,308
She never intended to leave.

835
01:43:50,063 --> 01:43:53,525
"The talk was that a new face

836
01:43:53,609 --> 01:43:57,196
had appeared on the promenade,

837
01:43:57,279 --> 01:43:59,990
a lady with a little dog. "

838
01:44:06,997 --> 01:44:08,707
She left me a message.

839
01:44:10,626 --> 01:44:12,503
A sort of will.

840
01:44:14,588 --> 01:44:17,508
I'll read the bit that concerns you.

841
01:44:25,307 --> 01:44:28,268
"There is money in the old tea tin.

842
01:44:28,352 --> 01:44:31,104
Give it to Michael Berg.

843
01:44:31,188 --> 01:44:35,859
He should send it,
alongside the 7,000 Marks in the bank,

844
01:44:35,943 --> 01:44:39,738
to the daughter who survived the fire.

845
01:44:39,822 --> 01:44:41,949
It's for her.

846
01:44:42,032 --> 01:44:45,077
She should decide what to do with it.

847
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:51,416
And tell Michael I said hello. "

848
01:46:09,703 --> 01:46:12,080
- Ms. Mather?
- Yes.

849
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:14,875
- You're Michael Berg.
- Yes.

850
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:16,877
I was expecting you.

851
01:46:18,253 --> 01:46:21,924
- Please.
- Thank you.

852
01:46:22,007 --> 01:46:26,470
So you must tell me, exactly what
brings you to the United States?

853
01:46:26,553 --> 01:46:29,640
I was here already.
I was at a conference in Boston.

854
01:46:29,723 --> 01:46:31,016
- You're a lawyer?
- Yes.

855
01:46:31,099 --> 01:46:36,146
I was intrigued by your letter,
but I can't say I wholly understood it.

856
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:40,234
- You attended the trial?
- Yes. Almost 20 years ago.

857
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:46,156
I was a law student. I remember you.
I remember your mother very clearly.

858
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:50,077
My mother died in Israel
a good many years ago.

859
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,580
I... I'm sorry.

860
01:46:53,664 --> 01:46:55,582
Go on, please.

861
01:46:57,459 --> 01:46:59,336
Perhaps you heard.

862
01:46:59,419 --> 01:47:04,216
Hanna Schmitz recently died.
She killed herself.

863
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:07,010
She was a friend of yours?

864
01:47:08,512 --> 01:47:09,972
A kind of friend.

865
01:47:11,515 --> 01:47:13,517
It's as simple as this.

866
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,938
Hanna was illiterate
for the greater part of her life.

867
01:47:18,021 --> 01:47:21,191
Is that an explanation
of her behavior?

868
01:47:22,901 --> 01:47:25,154
- No.
- Or an excuse?

869
01:47:25,237 --> 01:47:27,364
No. No.

870
01:47:30,409 --> 01:47:34,121
She taught herself to read
when she was in prison.

871
01:47:34,204 --> 01:47:36,874
I sent her tapes.

872
01:47:39,501 --> 01:47:43,380
She had always liked...
being read to.

873
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:52,973
Why don't you start
by being honest with me?

874
01:47:53,056 --> 01:47:56,101
At least start that way.

875
01:47:56,185 --> 01:47:58,812
What was the nature
of your friendship?

876
01:48:03,734 --> 01:48:06,570
When I was young,
I had an affair with Hanna.

877
01:48:12,493 --> 01:48:14,369
I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg.

878
01:48:14,453 --> 01:48:16,622
And...

879
01:48:16,705 --> 01:48:18,832
...even if I could,
I'm not willing to.

880
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:21,543
I was almost 16
when I took up with her.

881
01:48:21,627 --> 01:48:24,880
The affair only lasted a summer.
But...

882
01:48:26,423 --> 01:48:28,592
But what?

883
01:48:34,431 --> 01:48:36,141
I see.

884
01:48:38,352 --> 01:48:43,106
And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge
the effect she'd had on your life?

885
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:48,195
She'd done much worse
to other people.

886
01:48:53,158 --> 01:48:54,868
I've never told anyone.

887
01:48:59,206 --> 01:49:02,501
People ask all the time
what I learned in the camps.

888
01:49:02,584 --> 01:49:05,295
But the camps weren't therapy.

889
01:49:07,422 --> 01:49:10,134
What do you think these places were,
universities?

890
01:49:11,802 --> 01:49:14,388
We didn't go there to learn.

891
01:49:14,471 --> 01:49:18,517
One becomes very clear
about these things.

892
01:49:21,979 --> 01:49:24,648
What are you asking for?
Forgiveness for her?

893
01:49:24,731 --> 01:49:27,484
Or do you just want
to feel better yourself?

894
01:49:27,568 --> 01:49:31,405
My advice? Go to the theater
if you want catharsis. Please.

895
01:49:31,488 --> 01:49:33,365
Go to literature.

896
01:49:33,448 --> 01:49:36,660
Don't go to the camps.

897
01:49:38,203 --> 01:49:40,664
Nothing comes out of the camps.

898
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:45,210
Nothing.

899
01:49:58,515 --> 01:50:00,350
What she wanted...

900
01:50:01,268 --> 01:50:05,689
What she wanted was
to leave you her money.

901
01:50:05,772 --> 01:50:08,609
- I have it with me.
- To do what?

902
01:50:10,694 --> 01:50:12,446
As you think fit.

903
01:50:23,457 --> 01:50:25,042
Here.

904
01:50:33,592 --> 01:50:38,388
When I was a little girl,
I had a tea tin for my treasures.

905
01:50:38,472 --> 01:50:42,768
Not quite like this.
It had Cyrillic lettering.

906
01:50:45,646 --> 01:50:48,899
I took it with me to the camp,
but it got stolen.

907
01:50:48,982 --> 01:50:52,486
- What was in it?
- Sentimental things.

908
01:50:52,569 --> 01:50:56,657
A piece of hair from our dog.
Some tickets to the operas

909
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:00,661
my father had taken me to.
It wasn't stolen for its contents.

910
01:51:00,744 --> 01:51:04,623
It was the tin itself

911
01:51:04,706 --> 01:51:07,334
that was valuable,

912
01:51:07,417 --> 01:51:09,086
what you could do with it.

913
01:51:17,261 --> 01:51:20,180
There's nothing
I can do with this money.

914
01:51:20,264 --> 01:51:23,684
I give it to anything associated
with extermination of Jews,

915
01:51:23,767 --> 01:51:26,353
then to me it seems...

916
01:51:26,436 --> 01:51:29,773
...like absolution, and that's
something I'm neither willing

917
01:51:29,857 --> 01:51:33,569
- nor in a position to grant.
- I was thinking maybe

918
01:51:33,652 --> 01:51:37,531
an organization to encourage literacy.

919
01:51:41,368 --> 01:51:43,871
Good. Good.

920
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:46,832
Do you know if there
is a Jewish organization?

921
01:51:46,915 --> 01:51:48,667
I'd be surprised if there isn't.

922
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:52,379
There's a Jewish organization
for everything.

923
01:51:52,463 --> 01:51:55,549
Not that illiteracy
is a very Jewish problem.

924
01:51:57,384 --> 01:52:00,637
Why don't you find out?
Send them the money.

925
01:52:16,862 --> 01:52:18,822
Shall I do it in Hanna's name?

926
01:52:20,824 --> 01:52:22,326
As you think fit.

927
01:52:27,623 --> 01:52:29,416
I'll keep the tin.

928
01:52:34,338 --> 01:52:36,006
Thank you.

929
01:53:27,891 --> 01:53:32,646
- Where are we going?
- I thought you liked surprises.

930
01:53:32,729 --> 01:53:35,858
I do. I do like surprises.

931
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:42,925
Hanna Schmitz.

932
01:54:47,262 --> 01:54:48,347
Who was she?

933
01:54:50,891 --> 01:54:53,310
That's what I wanted to tell you.

934
01:54:55,479 --> 01:54:57,606
That's why we're here.

935
01:55:05,781 --> 01:55:07,366
So tell me.

936
01:55:19,086 --> 01:55:21,505
I was 15.

937
01:55:24,091 --> 01:55:26,635
I was coming home from school.

938
01:55:28,679 --> 01:55:30,514
I was feeling ill.

939
01:55:31,849 --> 01:55:34,852
And a woman helped me.
