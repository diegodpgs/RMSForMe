1
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:47,468
Robin .

2
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:50,006
Look at me, Robin.

3
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,727
Do you believe when I say I love you?

4
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,778
How long has this been going on?

5
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:03,563
24 years? 25?

6
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,197
I've always been there for you.

7
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,740
Always, in any situation.

8
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:12,246
To all your... choices, all your fears...

9
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:13,829
all that...

10
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,959
... enslavement here, anxieties, I was there.

11
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,588
All the irrational walkouts,

12
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:24,300
always when... shooting was
just about to start.

13
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,180
"Do me a favor, Al, get me out of this,
get me out of that".

14
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:28,639
"Get me out clean",

15
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:30,639
"without burning any bridges".

16
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:33,969
"Aaron needs me at home."

17
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:38,062
But Aaron is just an excuse.

18
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:41,714
Lousy choices.

19
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:45,360
That's your whole story, Robin.

20
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:47,444
Lousy choices.

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,743
Lousy movies,

22
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,948
lousy men, friends you couldn't trust.

23
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,204
Even  the one thing you can't choose,

24
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:56,288
your mother

25
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:59,156
You made a lousy choice there, too.

26
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,074
You had it all, Robin.

27
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,166
Movie queen at 24.

28
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:09,484
All them big studios came crawling.

29
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,240
Maybe I was too soft on you...

30
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,790
...like everyone says.

31
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:21,473
I don't know.

32
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,277
Maybe I really was.

33
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:29,295
But you were just a kid.

34
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,489
You were scared.

35
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:34,076
You made that choices,
you made them all on your own.

36
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:36,448
And you slammed all the open doors,

37
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,187
crushed all the dreams.

38
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:41,791
And now...

39
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:44,961
Now...

40
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:47,579
And now what, Al?

41
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:50,761
Talk to me, what are they offering?

42
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:54,140
I've no idea that they offer,
I wish I knew.

43
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,602
They called this morning
and yelled at me for 20 minutes,

44
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:58,477
about how they're sick of us.

45
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,381
Said it was a "final offer",

46
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:02,935
that this proposal won't be on a table again.

47
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,654
A quotation: "That won't be on the table again."

48
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:08,342
And what do you think it is?

49
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:10,066
How on Earth would I know?

50
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,592
One thing I do know: they won't be back.

51
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:17,821
They never spoke to me that way, Robin.

52
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:18,893
Ever.

53
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:21,878
Sorry of that, Mom.
I think you need to go now.

54
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:22,709
What happened ?

55
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:25,424
Airport security called. No pressure,
same as usual.

56
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:57,575
Aaron!

57
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:34,613
If [...] kite goes over property fence,

58
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:35,827
you know what' gonna happen.
- I know.

59
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:37,992
I know, I'm sorry,
it's not going to happen again.

60
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:08,353
So what was that [air]?

61
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:11,023
United 435 from Rochester?

62
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:13,401
Actually, no.

63
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,257
- What was it then?
- Um...

64
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,595
United... but not Rochester.

65
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:19,996
Let's see...

66
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,546
Wednesday, 6 p.m.

67
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,620
Fort Lauderdale?

68
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:27,200
I know, Minneapolis.

69
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:32,585
- That's not what matters.
- What matters then?

70
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:37,587
That the wind was blowing from the west,

71
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,776
There my lady feel like a Queen
over the runways...

72
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:44,349
...and that it looked like a match made in Heaven.

73
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,184
I thought that any minute
they were gonna unite.

74
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,312
Those colors!

75
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,809
That red,

76
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:53,143
that white

77
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:55,197
and the black clouds.

78
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:58,571
So really powerful.

79
00:05:58,654 --> 00:05:59,983
OK, but guess what?

80
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:02,095
- It's not gonna happen anymore,
you know that, right?

81
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:05,582
- Why not, why do you care ?
- Because he's not gonna go there,
that's why it's not gonna happen.

82
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:09,675
All right ? Because the next time
the line goes over the fence,

83
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:11,445
we gonna have to pack
everything in the house

84
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:13,707
we gonna have to move to
a lousy neighborhood in the city,

85
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,135
where will be no sky for me to see, or kites.

86
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:19,007
I'd rather live in some lousy neighborhood
in the city than this shit.

87
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,217
Oh, that's not new.

88
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:25,493
You know, I saved you today.

89
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:27,059
You saved me? From what?

90
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:28,933
From Al's proposal.

91
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:31,118
What was he offering so sweetly?

92
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,277
Tell her, Mom.

93
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:39,277
- What did he offer?
- I DON'T know, I don't know.

94
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:41,503
Sci-Fi? Graphic novel?

95
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:44,154
Holocaust? I don't see WHY you won't
do a Holocaust flick?

96
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,203
Every B-grade actress that does Holocaust [...] something in.

97
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,994
You could play both sides.

98
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,243
What do you mean, both sides?

99
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:53,123
Well, look at you.

100
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,937
Nazi and victim.

101
00:06:56,676 --> 00:06:58,621
You're one-side purpose
for a Holocaust flick.

102
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,349
-You know what?
-What?

103
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:03,352
You could even play a collaborator
if they needed one.

104
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:06,268
How many actresses have THAT
[...] talent these days?

105
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:48,267
Yeah, I remember. I remember when you
first came to the studio.

106
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,646
I was a... young number-crutcher,

107
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,892
down the hall.

108
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:54,461
Everybody said: "Here she comes!"

109
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:56,816
"She is beautiful, she is sexy,

110
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:59,739
She's got brains, power and ability

111
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,133
modesty, wildness, fantasy."

112
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,748
And she's one of us, goddam'it, she's...

113
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:10,114
She's from Texas!"

114
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:15,754
She's not some-some... some actress
that comes from the middle of Australia

115
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,755
that grew up on some distant farm,

116
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:20,670
that she rode a hundred miles
to get to closest movie

117
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:23,294
where the projector runs on bunker fuel!

118
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:28,600
I remember, standing in the hallway...

119
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:30,726
... watching you walk in.

120
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:32,809
And you were so beautiful.

121
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:37,229
You were  "Princess Bride" - Buttercup.

122
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,319
I imagined switching your face
for that of Grace Kelly's.

123
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:45,221
the "Rear Window" poster. That was a good idea.

124
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:47,956
You were the future, Robin.

125
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:51,280
You were the promise, the answer.

126
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,910
You were the whole package.

127
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:57,952
And now I'm...

128
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:01,167
...I'm in this situation.

129
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,257
Exactly what situation are you in, Jeff?

130
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:08,341
The situation of offering of the last contract
that you'll ever have.

131
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:11,764
The last?

132
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:14,227
Already? I'm not even 45.

133
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:16,432
Things are changing quickly.

134
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:20,935
Very soon, this whole structure
we all love so much

135
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:22,352
... will be gone.

136
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:24,316
What [...] Miramount?

137
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:27,618
God forbid!

138
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:30,304
I mean the structure around the actor:

139
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,278
the agents, the managers,

140
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:33,993
all that [...] the trailer

141
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,961
the drugs, the Coke, the depression, the...

142
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,131
breakups, and lovers, and sexual kinks,

143
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:41,543
the broken contracts,

144
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:44,485
terrible legitimization of tasteless scripts,

145
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:47,638
the post-failure blues, the skipping out on PR

146
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:49,549
begging for forgiveness.

147
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:51,749
All that... can be gone.

148
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,660
Get my drift ?

149
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,192
No, not really.

150
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:05,787
We at Miramount, want to...

151
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:07,786
...want to scan you.

152
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:12,038
All of you - your body, your face,
your... emotion,

153
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:15,958
your laughter, your tears,
your climaxing, your happiness,

154
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:20,196
your depressions, your... fears, longings.

155
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:25,453
We want to sample you, we
want to preserve you, we want...

156
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:27,261
...all this, this...

157
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:29,421
...this thing, this thing called...

158
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,090
"Robin Wright".

159
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,012
What will you do with this... thing ?

160
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:38,938
That you call Robin Wright?

161
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,387
Will do all the things that
your Robin Wright wouldn't do.

162
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:44,450
Like what ?

163
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:47,722
Like all the movies that you missed [...]

164
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:49,700
because of your LOUSY choices.

165
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:52,286
You gave in, you gave up, you fled, you quit,

166
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,912
God knows what you did!

167
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:55,575
And you did it the last minute,

168
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:58,649
you clogged our productions
and you cost us MILLIONS!

169
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:04,206
How old are you?

170
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:09,116
What difference does it make how old I am,
if you're gonna create

171
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:13,422
me at any age at your computer! What difference
does it make to you if I am 16 or 60?

172
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,401
It doesn't.

173
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,435
I need Buttercup from "Princess Bride".

174
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:21,303
I need Jenny from "Forrest Gump."

175
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:23,266
I need a... what was her name?

176
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,238
from "A State Of Grace"?

177
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:27,127
That's what I need, I don't need you.

178
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:31,239
I need you only for your... for your history.

179
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:34,385
A history paid with lousy choices
you just said so yourself.

180
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:36,959
Yes. For the last 15 years, yes, sure.

181
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:39,171
[All your movies tanked, no-not one... ]

182
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:40,955
could keep it's head above water.

183
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:45,140
But I can save you, Robin.
I can save you.

184
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:49,040
- From what?
- From yourself! From yourself!

185
00:11:53,598 --> 00:11:54,760
You knew about this?

186
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,050
Knew about what?

187
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:59,173
about all this crap he's offering me?

188
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:03,349
Oh, he doesn't know anything, he still thinks
that cameras run on bunker fuel.

189
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,017
On what?

190
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:08,246
A bunker fuel, that's crude oil.

191
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:10,770
Never mind. He is from the Stone Age.

192
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:17,530
Your career is almost over.

193
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,982
You fell off the Top-O

194
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:24,730
In the economy of scanned actors, um...

195
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,205
...you are not worth... 2 bucks.

196
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:31,503
We are at war, Robin.

197
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:35,854
Any actor who doesn't sign within
the next 6 months is dead. Gone.

198
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,268
Characters erased from the screen forever.

199
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,852
You'll be back on all fours,

200
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,632
begging me to sample you.

201
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,729
What is it that I have to do
to make that happen?

202
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:52,497
Nothing.

203
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:55,695
Just sign.

204
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,740
Half a day of scanning.

205
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:58,703
- That's it?
- That's it.

206
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:01,958
That and... you must agree to never act again.

207
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,825
Anywhere for all eternity.

208
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:08,255
What do you mean, "anywhere"?

209
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:11,509
No movies, no TV show,

210
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:14,428
no school plays, no French theater

211
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:15,793
in Western Australia?

212
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:17,761
"Anywhere" means Anywhere.

213
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:23,415
Robin Wright The Actress will live and breathe...

214
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,972
within the walls of Miramount Studios.

215
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:29,982
And this Robin Wright can take the money

216
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:33,030
and fly off to some island in Polynesia

217
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:34,739
to discover her true self.

218
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:38,953
Whadda you say?

219
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:44,222
You know, it's interesting. Um...

220
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,757
We actresses used to talk about how we never

221
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
wanted to sleep with you for a part
in the movie, but

222
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:51,239
but you know what? Honestly, I think
I'd rather do that...

223
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:54,503
than be a fucking chip in your computer. [...]

224
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:57,800
So, thanks.

225
00:13:58,556 --> 00:13:59,635
But, no thanks.

226
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:09,815
The offer is valid for 30 days.

227
00:14:10,026 --> 00:14:11,215
After that, she's on her own.

228
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,343
[...], sweetie?

229
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:48,261
What's up?

230
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:57,364
I was tired, I guess.

231
00:14:58,908 --> 00:15:01,338
You want to try and fly the Wright brothers' glider ?

232
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,244
No... she's not ready yet.

233
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,455
So maybe [...] the Cody's ?

234
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:11,457
I do not know.

235
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,292
I missed the 2 o'clock landing.

236
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:25,423
What's wrong?

237
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:30,291
- You look... you look sad.

238
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:31,962
- Really?
-Yeah.

239
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,819
Why don't you fly one of Cody Bank's?

240
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,540
-Me?
-Yeah.

241
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,948
- I do not think so.
- You can do it.

242
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,027
Just the little one.

243
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:48,697
Come on.

244
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:51,992
You better try it for once, alone.

245
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:54,534
Gotta see what it feels like.

246
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,009
I'll be there and watch you on,

247
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:01,367
so it does not go with the fence.

248
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:05,382
Don’t want to get kicked out of this place, do we?

249
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:17,118
Sarah, [get it]

250
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,293
Me?

251
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:20,381
Did you ever see someone come to visit me here?

252
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,045
Like you hold it.

253
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,229
It's okay.

254
00:17:37,278 --> 00:17:38,442
You could call.

255
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,676
What good would that have done?
You haven't answer my calls

256
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,189
since the meeting at the studio.

257
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,325
This is Steve. He'll draw up
your contract with the studio.

258
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:48,200
He's a scanning  contract genius.

259
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:51,002
Keanu Reeves, Michelle Williams - he
did that contracts.

260
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:53,163
They are [hermetically] scanned.

261
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,658
Nice to meet you.

262
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:58,284
Hi, kids!

263
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:08,553
- You want a drink, Al?
- Sure.

264
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:11,119
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

265
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:18,074
- It's a real glider.
- Yeah.

266
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:21,100
Thank you, this is... this is beautiful.

267
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,353
And who is this ?

268
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:32,330
This is Steve, a new lawyer I'm working with.

269
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:34,119
Scanning contract genius

270
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:37,767
This is one hell of a warehouse
you guys have here.

271
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:39,705
Oh no, it's not a warehouse.

272
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:42,424
It's an old hangar for the DC-9s.

273
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,130
It was built in like 1973.

274
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:47,780
Wow! I mean, you could NEVER get
a 17 [...] permits

275
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:50,761
to do a residential conversion like this
these days, that's for sure.

276
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:53,676
Scanning genius, eh?

277
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:56,729
Well, I've happened to have seen
on the entertainment channel

278
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:01,180
studios that's turning the sample actors
into these tiny little computer creatures.

279
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,070
I mean,  it must change the way
contracting works, completely.

280
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:06,237
It's absolutely true, uh....

281
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,340
- Sara.
- Yes, that's absolutely true, Sarah.

282
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:10,925
is a completely different type of contracts,
it's a one-off sale.

283
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:13,973
Very tricky, lots of details and you have to be sharp.

284
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:16,349
'Cause it's not going back to fix it afterwards.
- Uh-huh.

285
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:18,548
What do you mean by "one-off sale" ?

286
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,962
Once they sample you, and you are in the computer
there is no way back.

287
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:24,662
So whatever was agreed before
the sampling - that's the way it is.

288
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:26,676
So you have to be really careful.

289
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,508
The studio owns the character.

290
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:31,135
- W-What character?
- One that used to be the actor.

291
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:32,110
"Used to be"?

292
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:35,886
The minute the studio pays and scans,
the actor isn't an actor,

293
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:38,177
He's just a person, a nobody.

294
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:41,660
The actor he once was
is now on a character

295
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:42,866
in the studio's computer.

296
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:44,058
The studio can do whatever they want.

297
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:47,195
Unless the lawyer puts a clause in,
saying that they can't some.

298
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:49,050
It's very tricky.

299
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,240
Very tricky.

300
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:53,137
It's a new field. We're on the cusp.

301
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,284
- So what happens to the actor?
- What actor?

302
00:19:57,043 --> 00:20:00,207
The one that used to be the actor
is now this... computer creature.

303
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,701
He goes off to play golf somewhere.

304
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:05,560
And what if he does not like golf?

305
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,380
Well then he plays... with whatever.

306
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:12,470
Do you have a screen in this house?

307
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,839
Or is that too progressive for you, guys?

308
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,898
You know what, there's something else
I haven't told you.

309
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,184
- Oh yeah ? - Yeah.
- What is it ? What haven't you told me?

310
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:29,237
They will be in 15 minutes, so, get it out. What?

311
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:33,159
Oh my God...

312
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:35,899
You were with Maria, too.

313
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:38,655
Oh, say it, you piece of shit.

314
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:40,085
Say you were with her, too.

315
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,244
I knew that, honey,
I knew it the whole time.

316
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,085
Where that little slut seduces you out...

317
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,868
Oh my God, Max... Max! It makes me wanna vomit.

318
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:51,790
- No, I wasn't with Maria.
- Oh, no? NO ?!

319
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:54,013
- Well, then who?
- I wasn't with anybody.

320
00:20:54,096 --> 00:20:55,212
But...

321
00:20:58,068 --> 00:20:59,511
I voted for Bush.

322
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:10,313
You voted for Bush?

323
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,519
I voted for Bush. You know what,
I voted for both Bushes,

324
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:15,189
senior and junior,

325
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,796
four times!

326
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,080
Who are you?

327
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:27,402
Oh my God, who did I marry? Sweetie-sweetie...

328
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:33,842
That isn't Michelle.

329
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:35,632
That is Michelle!

330
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:38,470
No, I mean, obviously it's Michelle, but...

331
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:41,472
... you telling me she wasn't there
when they did this?

332
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:46,402
You really want to know ? She was in Paris when
they were making that crap on their computers.

333
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:49,678
I'm shocked.

334
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:51,987
I mean, it's... perfect.

335
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,406
Perfect? No.

336
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:56,071
But it's not bad at all for the beginning
of the revolution.

337
00:21:58,173 --> 00:21:59,150
Notice anything?

338
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:00,663
Look at that morons!

339
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:03,490
They've been trying to solve that bug for 3 years.

340
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,456
I do not find that funny at all.

341
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,915
Well, OK. Just wait till you see that wink
in the sex scenes. It will [...]

342
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,162
That's hilarious!

343
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:11,627
Yo, Mom!

344
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:13,833
You got to admit it's good stuff!

345
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:15,297
Do not be so harsh,

346
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,807
technophobia never got human nature anywhere.

347
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,514
So, you're with them now, huh?

348
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:21,863
Hmm, you switched sides?

349
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:24,344
Oh, come on, Robin, drop that 'pocrisy.

350
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,646
It's not like anything has changed.

351
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:28,036
They came, they took,

352
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,441
they created a crappy romcom,

353
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:33,060
just like they've been doing since the 40s.

354
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:35,777
You think it'd be any better for her, or for you?

355
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,196
She was stuck on the set for six weeks?

356
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:39,376
Like a dog?

357
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:43,168
- Kissing some actor with bad breath?
- Oh, let me see...

358
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:46,285
You don't have the problem with the fact
that they didn't ask her?

359
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,493
When did they ever ask you?

360
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,488
You've always been their puppet.

361
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:55,340
All of them - the producers, the directors,

362
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:56,732
they told you what to do,

363
00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:58,846
they told you how to behave, how to act,

364
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,065
how to smile, how to love.

365
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:03,682
And they gave you the subtext

366
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:07,306
for every... fucking... crappy line they [...] out.

367
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:09,439
And when you hit 35,

368
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:10,895
they told you how to look young.

369
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:13,101
Because if you didn't do
what they wanted you to do,

370
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:16,321
shave off a couple of years for that
beautiful face of yours,

371
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:19,319
you would... cease to exist, for Christ's sake!

372
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:22,260
So... what's... the difference?

373
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:24,247
The fucking choice?

374
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,533
Yes, the fucking choice!
Al, what are you talking about?

375
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:31,087
It is the gift of choice
that is being taken away!

376
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,831
I don't want somebody else deciding

377
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:34,874
when I can be, what I want to be,

378
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:37,499
I want to decide! That's MY choice!

379
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:39,679
To decide if I want to be a hooker,

380
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:42,716
if I want to be an opera singer,
if I want to play Keith Richards.

381
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,757
That's my choice - not theirs.

382
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:47,139
You delusional!

383
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:50,058
What kind of choice was it, when they
stressed you out?

384
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:51,979
Saying that if you didn't work for a year,

385
00:23:52,062 --> 00:23:54,774
you would cease to exist? That's a choice?

386
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:56,323
All the women

387
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:58,066
who were face-lifted to death,

388
00:23:58,281 --> 00:23:59,609
they can't smile

389
00:23:59,824 --> 00:24:01,948
or show pain or emotion,

390
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,275
that's a choice?

391
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:07,035
That's just staying on as their tools, don't you get it ?

392
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:11,120
We've been saved, by some miracle,

393
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:13,790
through these fucking computer samples!

394
00:24:14,297 --> 00:24:15,693
We've been SAVED!

395
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:20,511
You're nuts if you don't take that deal!
I swear to you, you're a [raving mad]

396
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:22,635
And everything they say about you is true!

397
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:26,374
About your terrible fucking choices! Wake up, Robin!

398
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:29,059
This is your key to freedom.

399
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,216
How is it going, my friend?

400
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,514
Everything seems good, Dr. Barker.

401
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:09,568
Any new sky monsters?

402
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:14,023
- Um, yeah, I... Look, I have a real thing now -
the original Wright brothers.
- Oh wov.

403
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,388
- That is, the glider?
- Uh-huh. - Wov.

404
00:25:16,943 --> 00:25:19,819
That's December 17, 1903 ?

405
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:24,156
I- I built a replica. It's exactly like that, but...

406
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:27,745
15 feet wide. Yeah. She's about to make a debut.

407
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:28,695
Very good.

408
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,289
You know, when I think about it, you must be

409
00:25:30,373 --> 00:25:32,458
part of the Wright brothers. The third one.
- Yeah.

410
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:33,748
- Aaron Wright.
- Yeah.

411
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,711
I am the original Wright brother.

412
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,456
I build better than them, cause, you know...

413
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,048
I build in a world of, um,

414
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:40,923
jet planes and spaceships.

415
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:42,120
It's totally different.

416
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:45,554
And, you know - don't forget they had no competition.
- Yeah.

417
00:25:58,943 --> 00:25:59,777
Siren.

418
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:02,560
Silent.

419
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:05,236
Glam.

420
00:26:06,742 --> 00:26:07,739
Love.

421
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:10,408
Kite.

422
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:12,154
Kite.

423
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,574
Hear.

424
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,035
Ear.

425
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:20,167
Car.

426
00:26:21,424 --> 00:26:22,622
Far.

427
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:25,124
Remember, Aaron,

428
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:26,970
Just repeat the words.

429
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:32,929
Table.

430
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:34,385
Able.

431
00:26:35,062 --> 00:26:36,178
Sky.

432
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:37,788
Sky.

433
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,516
Parade.

434
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,523
Afraid.

435
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:44,984
Shell.

436
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:47,236
Fell.

437
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:52,534
It got to be the sign of decline ?

438
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,866
Well, it's too early to say, but...

439
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:59,080
... it looks his [...] is deteriorating [...]
in terms of his hearing loss, yes.

440
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:01,836
Train.

441
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:03,962
Pain.

442
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:05,337
Crown.

443
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,126
Alone.

444
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:08,674
Storm.

445
00:27:09,514 --> 00:27:10,546
Worm.

446
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:15,757
And in terms of the...

447
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:17,681
ophthalmologist report, um...

448
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:20,310
oh, that is not terribly promising either.

449
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:24,982
It has definitely moved into the regnitis pigmentosa stage.

450
00:27:25,822 --> 00:27:28,620
Is that, um... a long...

451
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:31,615
... [Jonah] way of saying something horrific?

452
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:34,865
No, that is a very long expression to say that...

453
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:36,991
...his visual fields are constricting.

454
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:41,420
Eventually, his night sight abilities
will decline dramatically,

455
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:45,030
and... there will be... total night blindness.

456
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:46,541
And then what?

457
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:49,418
Dr. Barker?

458
00:27:49,637 --> 00:27:50,753
Yes, sir?

459
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:54,507
Could we please play the, um... volcano track again?

460
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:56,624
Volcano track?

461
00:27:58,187 --> 00:27:58,855
Thank you.

462
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:00,017
Yes, sure.

463
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:12,280
And the other 50%?

464
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,033
Is Aaron at 50%?

465
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:20,472
- That is the mystery with this syndrome.
- Right.

466
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:25,330
You will never know until he is 30 or 35...

467
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:27,916
... if he will be completely blind.

468
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:33,171
Aaron has a BEAUTIFUL mind.

469
00:28:33,723 --> 00:28:36,230
He is taking information in...

470
00:28:36,684 --> 00:28:39,114
and translating [in his own way], it is a gift.

471
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:41,001
He hears "Throne" says "Alone",

472
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:43,729
but he is perfectly aware of what he is doing.

473
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:47,580
He'll imagine what movies will be like
in 50 years.

474
00:28:49,155 --> 00:28:52,954
I think that is s-s-somewhat similar
to what Aaron is doing..

475
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:54,481
- In what way?
- In the way that...

476
00:28:55,495 --> 00:28:58,372
Well, the movie guys will just have the electronic stimulae

477
00:28:58,456 --> 00:29:02,491
that our brains translate according
to what is in our subconscious.

478
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,828
See, people will be given story data,

479
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:08,752
and they'll cast their mother or their girlfriend

480
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,885
as Marlene Dietrich or you..

481
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:14,926
All depending on what is in their particular... box.

482
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:17,630
This is exactly what Aaron is doing now.

483
00:29:20,686 --> 00:29:22,287
He is a rare case,

484
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:24,396
and he is ahead of his time by...

485
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:27,478
...God knows how many decades.

486
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:33,026
What about you, my friend, how are you?

487
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:34,613
Okay.

488
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:38,027
Any new parts on the horizon?

489
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,455
I think so.

490
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:59,504
Whatever happens, let Steve do all the talking.

491
00:30:02,895 --> 00:30:04,806
Robin Wright for Jeff Green.

492
00:30:05,022 --> 00:30:07,893
Miss Wright, I did not recognize you.

493
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:10,402
What else is new?

494
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:43,138
You okay?

495
00:30:53,404 --> 00:30:54,946
"No child abuse,

496
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:58,992
no sex, only love story,
betrayal, romantic comedy,

497
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:00,697
no retard,

498
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:02,288
truly handicapped,

499
00:31:02,497 --> 00:31:03,778
no porn?

500
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:06,205
no Holocaust, no Nazis. "

501
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:07,777
You marked this up?

502
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:09,290
You better believe it.

503
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:11,527
What are you, some sort of
swastika freak or something?

504
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:14,087
- No, it's not him, it's my kids.
- It's her kids.

505
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,246
Your kids [is] Nazis and porn?

506
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:20,227
Porn? At your age?

507
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:26,718
Nazis and Holocaust winning awards.

508
00:31:26,938 --> 00:31:28,812
Awards for whom? For your computer artists?

509
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:31,967
Nice, yes, they are computer artists now,
not just technicians.

510
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:37,482
Look, this is just all... details,
it's tributes, minutia.

511
00:31:37,698 --> 00:31:40,950
I'll agree to everything except
this, um... Sci-Fi bullshit.

512
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:42,905
No Sci-Fi, Jack.

513
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:45,872
Sci-Fi is a dumb genre, in our opinion.

514
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,418
She's never done Sci-Fi before,
and she's not going to do it now.

515
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:53,414
Well, if she had done one Sci-Fi, this contract
would be worth 6 times as much!

516
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,214
No Sci-Fi, no contract.

517
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:57,510
Then, no contract.

518
00:31:58,678 --> 00:32:01,715
Why? Why, Sci-Fi is fantasy.

519
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:05,308
You know how many people
read "Lord of Rings"?

520
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:08,896
1 thousandth, not a single per cent

521
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,731
of the people who went to see the movie,

522
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:13,224
read the book. And you want to know why?

523
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:16,445
Because it is one hell of a complicated read,
that's why.

524
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:19,282
It's a nightmare. a [...]! It's-It's boring!

525
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:21,377
Did you read it before you made the movie?

526
00:32:22,118 --> 00:32:23,613
Are you kidding?

527
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:25,532
But I saw the movie,

528
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,621
and that's why we make movies.

529
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:32,503
- But that's not what I want to say.
- What do you want to say, Jeff?

530
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:35,996
That I want to make you young forever.

531
00:32:37,508 --> 00:32:38,967
That's what we gonna do.

532
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:43,252
How old are you?

533
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:45,928
45? 48? 50?

534
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:48,055
44.

535
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:52,021
Sign the Sci-Fi and I guarantee

536
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:55,608
that I'll make you 33... 34,

537
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:58,395
For ever young, I promise you.

538
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:00,740
For ever young.

539
00:33:01,204 --> 00:33:02,356
33-34?

540
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:04,283
- Which sounds better? - 32.

541
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:06,700
Greedy. That's greedy.

542
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:09,737
34 and we'll seal the deal.

543
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:10,657
For life.

544
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:12,377
You know, in some countries, life -

545
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:14,202
sentence means 20 years.

546
00:33:14,504 --> 00:33:15,203
In what countries?

547
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:16,883
- Middle East.
- Middle East?

548
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:20,572
They are fucking animals over there!
20 years for murder?

549
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:21,843
20 years?

550
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:24,257
In 20 years...

551
00:33:24,472 --> 00:33:27,509
...this technology will be as old
as the invention of the boomerang.

552
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:31,137
- 20 years.
- Okay, great.

553
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:37,691
- Can we do it now?
- What?

554
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,571
This thing that you need to do to me,
can we do it right this second?

555
00:33:41,763 --> 00:33:43,442
[...] I do not want to wait another day,

556
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,402
I want to do it now or never.

557
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:58,369
Robin Wright.

558
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:02,291
- Aren't you, um...?
- Yes, it's me.

559
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,167
- Chris... Christopher Ryne.
- Yes.

560
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,668
What are you doing here?

561
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,029
I'm the scanner.

562
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:10,100
Come on, don't feel sorry.

563
00:34:10,518 --> 00:34:12,662
The others guys are at home, doing nothing.

564
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:17,811
You were such a great cinematographer,
for so many great movies.

565
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:18,536
Thank you.

566
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:22,437
You know what - at least I get to work
with the actors, and... light.

567
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:26,067
I'm lucky - to be able to meet you at work.

568
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,099
Just like the old times.

569
00:34:29,038 --> 00:34:29,850
And,

570
00:34:30,817 --> 00:34:32,782
I also like that I get to tell you to...

571
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,567
... take off your beautiful dress.

572
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,677
A changing room down the hall
to your right.

573
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,670
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

574
00:35:11,213 --> 00:35:11,904
Chris?

575
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:16,161
Hello?

576
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:17,368
Anybody here?

577
00:35:17,654 --> 00:35:18,547
Yeah, I got you, Rob.

578
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,671
Just make yourself comfortable,
we'll start in a minute, OK?

579
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,887
I don't want to miss any of your...

580
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:37,269
...charming expressions here...

581
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:39,412
Princess.

582
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,602
Now, smile.

583
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:49,648
Wider.

584
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:52,119
You're happy

585
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:55,530
Happy

586
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:02,415
Now, laugh

587
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:06,337
Big laugh.

588
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:09,627
Gimme here your laugh.

589
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:18,762
Come on, give me a big laugh.

590
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:26,772
BIG laugh, yeah!

591
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,118
Now, that laughter...

592
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,949
... slowly

593
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,916
slowly...

594
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:41,824
turns...

595
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:45,663
... to emptiness.

596
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:52,757
...blankness...

597
00:36:56,434 --> 00:36:58,011
... the sadness.

598
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:02,144
I can't, stop... stop.

599
00:37:03,816 --> 00:37:05,442
Stop! Turn off the lights.

600
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:18,756
Chris, I got it.

601
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,001
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.

602
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:29,842
Robin, did I ever tell you
how I got into this business?

603
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:31,880
The agenting business?

604
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:33,519
I mean, the REAL story?

605
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:39,572
Of course, I never told you,
I was probably too embarrassed.

606
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,009
Can you believe, I've been in this business
since I was...

607
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,809
... 10 years old.

608
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,603
A 5th-grader.

609
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:48,997
An agent in the 5th grade.

610
00:37:50,613 --> 00:37:51,361
Let me explain.

611
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:54,610
We had this guy in our neighbourhood,
in Bronx.

612
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:57,282
Joey Fairy-Tail, they called him.

613
00:37:57,912 --> 00:37:59,078
He was this, um...

614
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:00,661
...you know...

615
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:02,328
How should I put it...

616
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,045
He was born with the tail.

617
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:08,494
A REAL tail.

618
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:10,715
We're talkin', um... an inch.

619
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:12,545
Maybe - maybe 2 inches.

620
00:38:13,177 --> 00:38:14,399
Like a boxer dog.

621
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:18,844
And... from the minute it came out, in gym class,

622
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:22,605
he suffered the most horrible abuse.

623
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:27,396
I can't describe to you what this kid
went through, an 8 year old boy.

624
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:31,601
They would strip him down in the street

625
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:34,320
singing songs to his tail.

626
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:36,659
The kids would stay outside his window and [...] yell:

627
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:39,328
"Hey Joey! , Gimme [...] your tail,

628
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:41,452
"I want to stir my chocolate milk!"

629
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:45,993
So... one day

630
00:38:46,397 --> 00:38:48,418
I go up to him, before school,

631
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:49,792
I had this idea.

632
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,942
I say: "Listen, Joey."

633
00:38:53,468 --> 00:38:54,844
"From now on,

634
00:38:55,303 --> 00:38:58,665
anyone who wants to go on your tail, that's a buck".

635
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:01,759
And he looks at me and goes:

636
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,185
"Really, Al?"

637
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:05,936
And what am I supposed to say to that?

638
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,607
Tell them: "Al said so?"

639
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,277
I was a scrawny kid,

640
00:39:12,653 --> 00:39:14,231
much [stooped]

641
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:16,067
a reject.

642
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,093
Not exactly the rugs-wrestler type.

643
00:39:19,952 --> 00:39:22,787
So that night, I went to the Twin Towers.

644
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:25,365
I mean the Bronx Twin Towers:

645
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:27,291
a Podlowsky brothers.

646
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:30,788
Remember Podlowsky? Started shaving at 10.

647
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:35,210
And at 13, they went dating
40-year old divorcees.

648
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:38,418
So I tell them about Joey Fairy-Tail,

649
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:41,431
and I offer them
50 cents for every kid

650
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:43,598
who wants to see his tail.

651
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:46,676
They take the tailships and manage the line,

652
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,966
and I do the booking and collect the fees!

653
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,829
That month, I made more dough

654
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:55,520
than my old man made as a shoemaker all year,

655
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:57,280
and I was 10 years old!

656
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:00,261
And from then on, the business took off.

657
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:04,991
By age 13, I was agenting for all the losers.

658
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:09,327
The cripples, the midgets and
the fire-eating hunchbacks of the Bronx.

659
00:40:09,836 --> 00:40:12,893
Within two years, we were the
richest family on the block.

660
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:18,126
But...

661
00:40:18,636 --> 00:40:20,199
When I was 15...

662
00:40:21,056 --> 00:40:22,005
...ahem...

663
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:24,910
the child protection got on my case

664
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:27,801
for abusing handicapped kids.

665
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:30,429
and I did three-months time.

666
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,314
And then,

667
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:36,710
after many years I wound up in this town.

668
00:40:37,463 --> 00:40:39,130
It's all glits and glitter,

669
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:41,743
and I was ashamed of my past.

670
00:40:44,662 --> 00:40:46,323
But deep inside,

671
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:50,657
I knew I had an advantage
over all the others:

672
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:54,428
the power to recognize a flaw,

673
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:56,460
a weakness,

674
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:58,671
a defect,

675
00:40:58,833 --> 00:40:59,969
and to exploit it

676
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:01,490
for my needs as an agent.

677
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:03,758
And...

678
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,465
And that's how I met you.

679
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:11,511
You were perfect for me.

680
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:15,064
As lovely as an angel,

681
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:18,612
and with the worst defect an actress can have.

682
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,069
Fear.

683
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:26,488
Such fear!

684
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:30,994
Real terror.

685
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:35,832
A terror that stand in the way of every desire.

686
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:41,794
Panic attacks before every critical meeting.

687
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:45,468
Paralysis

688
00:41:46,224 --> 00:41:48,893
at face with truly grip roles.

689
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:53,811
And I was there to help you.

690
00:41:55,066 --> 00:41:59,320
I was the inner demon that lived off your fears
and made a living

691
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:01,320
off your weakness.

692
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:09,787
Then the kids came along,

693
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:12,488
and all of a sudden you stopped being scared.

694
00:42:13,751 --> 00:42:15,875
You've never been so happy,

695
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:19,163
You just didn't want to work anymore,

696
00:42:19,382 --> 00:42:21,043
you wanted to be with them.

697
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:26,300
I [...] felt so abandoned.

698
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:30,391
That's when I realized...

699
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:33,742
I'm not your agent, I just love you.

700
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,605
I was afraid you were going to leave me.

701
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:51,072
Then all of a sudden, in the space of a few weeks,

702
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:54,533
Aaron's condition started going... downhill.

703
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,248
And my strength was rebuilt from your weakness.

704
00:43:03,676 --> 00:43:06,511
Then Aaron goes further and further away...

705
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,757
...and we were left alone.

706
00:43:15,563 --> 00:43:17,303
And now, you really can't leave...

707
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,603
...trapped inside that monster.

708
00:43:29,035 --> 00:43:31,159
This is your last performance.

709
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,913
And I guess it should bigger save you,

710
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:40,086
all your fears,

711
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:42,963
all your demons.

712
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:46,717
You didn't deserve that.

713
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:51,139
You don't deserve it.

714
00:44:19,585 --> 00:44:23,583
20 YEARS LATER

715
00:46:00,478 --> 00:46:02,166
Welcome to Abrahama, Ms. Wright.

716
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:04,262
Is this your first time with us?

717
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:07,442
It certainly is.

718
00:46:08,736 --> 00:46:11,019
[...] You are expected at the Miramount Abrahama hotel,

719
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,689
as a distinguished guest of the Futurist Congress.

720
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:22,712
That's a pretty good-looking car for it's age.

721
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:24,451
What year is it?

722
00:46:25,013 --> 00:46:26,229
2013.

723
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:33,551
Just a reminder, Miss Wright.

724
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:41,258
Abrahama City is a restricted animated zone.

725
00:46:42,854 --> 00:46:45,393
The only way to leave the animation zone

726
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:47,351
is when we meet again,

727
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:49,734
on your way out.

728
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,030
Your ampule.

729
00:48:39,512 --> 00:48:42,086
In the age of the spiritual machines

730
00:48:42,283 --> 00:48:44,764
where the streets have no names.

731
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:50,644
The Earth is covered with rage and shame.

732
00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:55,232
Agent Robin is back again!

733
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:11,586
"Triple R"

734
00:49:12,044 --> 00:49:15,129
"Rebel Robot Robin - Street Fighter."

735
00:49:15,464 --> 00:49:17,258
Now - in the air!

736
00:50:00,272 --> 00:50:02,176
Good afternoon, Miss Wright.

737
00:50:02,386 --> 00:50:05,340
Welcome to Miramount Hotel Abrahama.

738
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,131
The city of Abrahama

739
00:50:46,215 --> 00:50:47,792
and Miramount Nagasaki

740
00:50:47,876 --> 00:50:50,408
welcome you to the Futurist Congress.

741
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:53,053
We would like to remind you that Abrahama

742
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:56,557
is a fully restricted animated zone.

743
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:08,652
Agent Robin is back again!

744
00:51:12,331 --> 00:51:13,280
"Triple R"

745
00:51:15,459 --> 00:51:18,212
"Rebel Robot Robin - Street Fighter".

746
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:20,955
Now in the air!

747
00:51:35,146 --> 00:51:36,474
Hi, Aaron.

748
00:51:37,815 --> 00:51:39,600
So I see you've left your room.

749
00:51:40,526 --> 00:51:41,642
You feeling better?

750
00:51:41,861 --> 00:51:44,103
No, it means it's stopped raining,

751
00:51:44,322 --> 00:51:47,324
so I can walk without being afraid
of slipping on wet leaves.

752
00:51:48,493 --> 00:51:50,208
So, how does it look?

753
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:53,628
Oh my God, I wish you could see me animated,
it's pretty sick.

754
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:58,412
It's like a genius designer [...] bad asset trip.

755
00:51:58,628 --> 00:52:01,391
- How do you mean?
- Oh my God, I don't know. I look like...

756
00:52:02,465 --> 00:52:05,092
... a combination between Cinderella on heroin

757
00:52:05,176 --> 00:52:07,887
and an Egyptian Queen on a bad hair day.

758
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:08,884
Mom?

759
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:11,713
Did they recognize you, Mom?

760
00:52:11,933 --> 00:52:14,554
I mean, the new film is out all over the year.

761
00:52:15,921 --> 00:52:17,895
No, nobody sees me.

762
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:23,232
I'm just an old lady to them.

763
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,611
Probably 'cause you're animated.

764
00:52:26,906 --> 00:52:30,032
No, you never... recognize me anywhere.

765
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:32,781
Welcome to the Wright.

766
00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:35,369
No one's recognized me for 30 years.

767
00:53:00,124 --> 00:53:02,970
Aaron, you know, I can barely hear you in this crowd.

768
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,361
I gonna go to my room for a while.

769
00:53:05,444 --> 00:53:07,485
Check-in later, OK? I love you.

770
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:14,116
Robin Wright, um... personal guest
to the Miramount Classic.

771
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:17,662
Wright, Robin. You are the sixth one today.

772
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:20,037
The sixth what?

773
00:53:20,251 --> 00:53:22,208
The sixth Robin Wright.

774
00:53:22,545 --> 00:53:25,417
I guess they did not look as "Robin-ish" as you do.

775
00:53:26,155 --> 00:53:30,002
Anyway, Ralph will see you to your room,
Miss Wright.

776
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:32,343
Have a pleasant Congress.

777
00:54:43,668 --> 00:54:45,957
The Animated Zone...

778
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,845
Miss Wright

779
00:54:53,928 --> 00:54:55,969
think that your new film, "Street Fighter",

780
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,007
reflects our lives in any way?

781
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:00,595
Yeah, I do, I mean...

782
00:55:00,678 --> 00:55:02,895
You know, I find something new in this

783
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:05,106
character Agent Robin every time I do it

784
00:55:05,189 --> 00:55:07,967
like now, in The Street Fighter's production,
you know that...

785
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,604
... the robots, they come from the [...],

786
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:12,238
they're so much a part of our lives,

787
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:14,113
they... they are close to us.

788
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:19,027
Because people buy household robots and they...

789
00:55:19,704 --> 00:55:21,753
... basically just suck,

790
00:55:22,491 --> 00:55:26,669
pull [...] out of them, and then they just
use them up, and... and they expire, and...

791
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:29,172
... the poor robots, you know, they used to have

792
00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:31,551
Rehab centers for them, and now they just...

793
00:55:33,342 --> 00:55:36,468
... they use them as scrap, it's so sad, and...

794
00:55:36,856 --> 00:55:41,631
... I don’t know, people call "Triple R" Sci-Fi,
but I- I just say...

795
00:55:42,727 --> 00:55:44,114
... it's documentary.

796
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:52,100
Room Service?

797
00:55:52,778 --> 00:55:54,689
Hello? Can I have room service?

798
00:55:54,906 --> 00:55:57,908
Yes, Miss Wright. How can I help you?

799
00:55:58,304 --> 00:56:01,703
I... the, um... the light went off here,
the power, everything's off.

800
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,498
Does that make sense, or...
or is this just in my mind?

801
00:56:06,709 --> 00:56:09,165
Ultimately everything makes sense,

802
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:11,476
and everything is in our mind.

803
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:14,084
What would you like to order, Miss Wright?

804
00:56:14,926 --> 00:56:17,595
A want a full breakfast, just 3 eggs, um...

805
00:56:19,263 --> 00:56:21,553
and hash-browns and toast, please.

806
00:56:21,766 --> 00:56:23,343
And to drink, Miss Wright?

807
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:24,675
No, I'll skip the liquids.

808
00:56:24,758 --> 00:56:25,724
All types of?

809
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:27,694
Yes, all types. How long will that be?

810
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:31,323
2 seconds. How would you like your eggs,
Miss Wright?

811
00:56:32,151 --> 00:56:33,100
Over easy, but...

812
00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:34,766
will the yolks be soft

813
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,738
by the time they hit the 100th floor?

814
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:38,692
But of course, Miss Wright.

815
00:56:38,908 --> 00:56:42,532
That's exactly why we at
Miramount Hotel Abrahama

816
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:44,786
invented the supersonic elevator.

817
00:56:50,294 --> 00:56:53,297
Ralph, it's dark in here or is it
just in my mind?

818
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:55,298
Everything is in our mind.

819
00:56:55,508 --> 00:56:59,091
If you see the dark, then you chose the dark.

820
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:56,033
Oh my God, it's in the water!

821
00:57:57,403 --> 00:57:59,243
it's in the fucking tap water!

822
00:58:00,552 --> 00:58:01,842
Oh, my God.

823
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:11,537
Jeff!

824
00:58:12,627 --> 00:58:14,786
Jeff Green, did you hear me?

825
00:58:16,255 --> 00:58:17,833
Can you fucking hear me?

826
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:21,743
Stop!

827
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:25,677
STOP!! I'll sign! I'll sign.

828
00:58:28,059 --> 00:58:30,680
Just stop fucking with my head!

829
00:58:34,232 --> 00:58:35,774
Please, stop.

830
00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:39,528
I'll sign.

831
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:57,042
If it be your will,

832
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:02,552
that I speak no more,

833
00:59:05,304 --> 00:59:08,306
And my voice be still,

834
00:59:10,935 --> 00:59:14,019
As it was before

835
00:59:16,282 --> 00:59:19,311
I will speak no more,

836
00:59:20,603 --> 00:59:25,155
I shall no pipe, none tune.

837
00:59:27,593 --> 00:59:30,822
I am spoken for...

838
00:59:31,622 --> 00:59:34,244
If it be your will...

839
00:59:57,899 --> 00:59:58,951
Are you Robin Wright?

840
01:00:00,902 --> 01:00:03,326
Yes, at least I used to be.

841
01:00:03,779 --> 01:00:04,978
Miramount Police!

842
01:00:06,265 --> 01:00:09,536
You went too far. You know we are busy
making you a star.

843
01:00:09,994 --> 01:00:12,663
Next time we'll shoot you. Fucking whore!

844
01:00:12,997 --> 01:00:14,799
Arrest her. NOW!!

845
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:23,213
Miss Wright, Mr. Green is expecting you at his office.

846
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:01,252
So you're here too, huh?

847
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:03,754
You and I are the only ones who survived.

848
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,127
And who are all the rest?

849
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,386
Characters they invented.

850
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:15,052
What have you been doing all these years?

851
01:01:15,393 --> 01:01:16,472
I was with UNICEF,

852
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:19,059
hanging out foods for the hungry kids of Africa.

853
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:19,936
And you?

854
01:01:22,066 --> 01:01:23,717
Taking care of my son.

855
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:36,873
Robin! Robin, Robin, Robin. Vow! Vow...

856
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:39,577
You look fantastic!  Un-animated, I mean.

857
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:41,872
Look who's left.

858
01:01:42,253 --> 01:01:45,421
Just you and... what's his name,
sitting outside, um...?

859
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:48,717
That guy's one thing, he cost me a fortune,
but you -

860
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,926
I paid 2 cents for your contract and
her you still are,

861
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:54,681
20 years later.

862
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:57,851
What you've been doing all these years?

863
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:01,227
Feeding hungry children in Africa.

864
01:02:03,274 --> 01:02:06,563
- There still is hungry kids there, huh?
- Well, not so many, thanks to you.

865
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:09,110
So... tell me about this congress, Jeff.

866
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:11,647
Why is everyone so stressed out?

867
01:02:11,866 --> 01:02:14,535
- Oh well, you will see in a while.
- What will I see?

868
01:02:16,162 --> 01:02:17,237
You see, Robin,

869
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:20,951
that pretty soon this whole structure
will stop existing.

870
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:22,816
Structure? What do you mean, Jeff?

871
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,254
This, the Miramount Classic,
the Miramount Hotel?

872
01:02:25,338 --> 01:02:28,727
No, no, no. Not Miramount Hotel. I mean,
this whole structure won't exist.

873
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,677
The script writer, who needs his antidepressants,

874
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:41,998
The ex-Russian story-board artist
with the drinking problem,

875
01:02:42,955 --> 01:02:45,314
Animators always behind deadline,

876
01:02:46,067 --> 01:02:49,693
And those idiots who fall in love
with their computer characters.

877
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:53,655
Special effects people, they can all
go to FUCK themselves!

878
01:02:56,751 --> 01:02:59,865
Movies are old news, Robin.

879
01:03:00,498 --> 01:03:03,072
A remanent of the last millennium.

880
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:07,535
As you will very soon find out  upstairs,
in the Futurist Congress

881
01:03:07,755 --> 01:03:11,504
Miramount Nagasaki is entering a new age.

882
01:03:13,094 --> 01:03:16,137
We are in the era of free choice!

883
01:03:17,932 --> 01:03:21,288
And what does that mean for
the extension of our contract?

884
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,688
The contract is no big deal,

885
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:25,598
just a 20-year extension.

886
01:03:26,023 --> 01:03:27,964
And one other little clause.

887
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,227
What's in this "other little clause", Jeff?

888
01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:33,894
That from now on...

889
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:35,908
... they can drink you.

890
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:37,949
Or you can be eaten, like an omelette [...],

891
01:03:38,032 --> 01:03:39,323
or creme brulee.

892
01:03:39,537 --> 01:03:41,399
You see, Robin - from now on, you're...

893
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:44,744
...a substance, that is all.

894
01:03:45,334 --> 01:03:46,944
You're a chemical formula.

895
01:03:47,587 --> 01:03:49,717
that Miramount-Nagasaki's

896
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,795
brilliant pharmaceutical department has cracked.

897
01:03:53,551 --> 01:03:56,553
And people can - can drink you, in their milkshake,

898
01:03:56,762 --> 01:03:59,551
and imagine you the way that they LIKE.

899
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:04,354
- Everything?
- Yes.

900
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,429
"Everything", means everything.

901
01:04:07,773 --> 01:04:10,443
Drama, Little Red Riding Hood,

902
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:13,060
extreme art-house, porn,

903
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:16,233
comedy, Sci-Fi, trash, zombies.

904
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:18,276
WHAT do you care?

905
01:04:19,285 --> 01:04:20,761
Now tell me something, Robin:

906
01:04:20,953 --> 01:04:24,912
when you fantasies alone, in bed, in the dark

907
01:04:25,124 --> 01:04:27,497
do you pay him or her,

908
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,992
royalties?

909
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:39,507
You'll sign anyway, Robin.

910
01:04:39,722 --> 01:04:41,098
Oh yeah? And why do you think so?

911
01:04:42,058 --> 01:04:44,846
Because you might have sold your image
as an actress,

912
01:04:45,645 --> 01:04:48,743
but the actress never left your soul.

913
01:04:50,597 --> 01:04:52,780
You drove all this way just to be on stage

914
01:04:52,863 --> 01:04:54,836
for a single moment of fame.

915
01:04:55,404 --> 01:04:57,448
To be seen, after all these years.

916
01:04:58,282 --> 01:05:01,575
And you will sign for the same reason.

917
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:32,747
Ladies

918
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:34,879
and gentlemen.

919
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,294
LOOK AT US !!

920
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:46,741
For God's sake, look at us!!

921
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:51,136
Can you believe that a tiny mini-ampule

922
01:06:51,219 --> 01:06:55,144
manufactured at the Miramount-Nagasaki labs

923
01:06:55,365 --> 01:06:57,060
made THIS!!

924
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,682
neo-God creation!

925
01:07:14,418 --> 01:07:15,961
I'd say

926
01:07:16,213 --> 01:07:17,369
if you hear,

927
01:07:18,214 --> 01:07:18,955
you're a believer.

928
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:33,179
My friends, </ i>

929
01:07:33,563 --> 01:07:34,918
I came here

930
01:07:35,439 --> 01:07:36,686
to declare

931
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:41,439
that our great, great scientists

932
01:07:41,772 --> 01:07:44,395
at the Miramount-Nagasaki labs

933
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:46,490
have recently cracked

934
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:50,283
the chemical formula of FREE CHOICE!

935
01:07:58,546 --> 01:08:01,583
I, Reeve Bobs,

936
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:05,678
President  of Miramount-Nagasaki, here declare

937
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:07,138
that as of tomorrow

938
01:08:07,221 --> 01:08:09,720
that genius Free Choice formula

939
01:08:09,932 --> 01:08:11,956
be out in the market accessible

940
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:13,824
for each and every human being!

941
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,521
Now just imagine

942
01:08:22,737 --> 01:08:25,359
a life with no frustration.

943
01:08:39,378 --> 01:08:41,004
No jealousy.

944
01:08:43,424 --> 01:08:44,706
No ego.

945
01:08:48,221 --> 01:08:50,095
You have a dream?!

946
01:08:51,088 --> 01:08:53,649
Be your dream, for God's sake!

947
01:09:03,402 --> 01:09:04,660
Ladies and gentlemen,

948
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,485
It is a supreme honor for me

949
01:09:09,033 --> 01:09:10,943
to invite to this stage

950
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,037
the everlasting symbol

951
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,497
of the Miramount-Nagasaki revolution

952
01:09:16,707 --> 01:09:18,997
She used to be our finest actress

953
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:20,663
then she became

954
01:09:20,747 --> 01:09:23,631
the best ever DIGITAL actress

955
01:09:23,714 --> 01:09:25,277
Agent Robin!

956
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:28,256
And as of tomorrow

957
01:09:29,387 --> 01:09:31,427
you can be her!

958
01:09:31,681 --> 01:09:34,340
be her, be with her!!

959
01:09:34,642 --> 01:09:36,069
ROBIN WRIGHT!!

960
01:09:53,327 --> 01:09:54,573
Look at me.

961
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,907
They call me the "symbol".

962
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,495
I used to be an actress.

963
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:04,661
Then I was a pile of computer codes.

964
01:10:05,395 --> 01:10:09,627
And now, as of tomorrow, you gonna be able
to drink me, you can become me,

965
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:12,176
by drinking a milkshake.

966
01:10:13,347 --> 01:10:16,016
Wake up, people! Wake up!

967
01:10:16,639 --> 01:10:19,367
Behind every chemical compound you invent,

968
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:22,545
and use, there is a person built exactly like you.

969
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:24,143
From the same material,

970
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:25,784
the same loves,

971
01:10:25,985 --> 01:10:27,480
the same dreams.

972
01:10:28,488 --> 01:10:29,734
Wake up!

973
01:10:31,945 --> 01:10:33,244
This is my son.

974
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:35,986
He can barely hear, he is deaf.

975
01:10:37,455 --> 01:10:40,290
And you could have been his hope, all of you.

976
01:10:41,009 --> 01:10:42,575
Did you ever think

977
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:44,917
to direct your chemistry research

978
01:10:45,588 --> 01:10:46,644
to his problem?

979
01:10:47,256 --> 01:10:49,728
Or to hundreds of millions of other children?

980
01:10:51,442 --> 01:10:52,501
Did you, ever?

981
01:10:55,223 --> 01:10:57,285
I just want to remind you of one thing:

982
01:10:57,934 --> 01:10:59,345
that if you think,

983
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:02,932
that by releasing your chemistry,

984
01:11:03,147 --> 01:11:04,226
to the world

985
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:07,021
you'll dictate, how we desire,

986
01:11:07,447 --> 01:11:08,672
what we desire...

987
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:12,569
I just want to tell you: by doing that,

988
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:15,576
you will be releasing your conscience as well,

989
01:11:15,785 --> 01:11:18,324
and your conscience will devour you.

990
01:11:19,914 --> 01:11:21,546
And you'll die of guilt.

991
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:24,202
You will die of guilt.

992
01:11:30,299 --> 01:11:31,497
Look at me!

993
01:11:32,552 --> 01:11:34,676
I am your prophet of doom!

994
01:11:45,949 --> 01:11:47,221
FRIENDS!!

995
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:49,525
You've gone too far!

996
01:11:50,012 --> 01:11:51,311
Don't you get it?

997
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:54,372
Just imagine!

998
01:11:54,615 --> 01:11:57,535
Tomorrow when you leave Abrahama,

999
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:59,445
you will never know that you left!

1000
01:12:00,413 --> 01:12:01,279
Because

1001
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:03,787
from tomorrow on

1002
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:06,759
Abrahama will no longer be

1003
01:12:06,842 --> 01:12:08,934
a Looney Tunes playground!

1004
01:12:09,772 --> 01:12:13,319
Abrahama is going to be our life!

1005
01:13:02,308 --> 01:13:03,934
You should go back inside.

1006
01:13:23,807 --> 01:13:24,461
Robin!

1007
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:26,522
It is Robin, right?

1008
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:29,967
Let's go. Now!

1009
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:40,898
Breathe.

1010
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:51,438
Breath deeply, hold it as long as you can.

1011
01:13:54,402 --> 01:13:55,517
Come on.

1012
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:58,739
You need to get down below, I feel it coming.

1013
01:13:58,823 --> 01:14:00,971
- Do you believe them?
- Of course I believe them!

1014
01:14:01,495 --> 01:14:03,947
We already trapped in our animated characters.

1015
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:29,795
Sarah!

1016
01:14:35,276 --> 01:14:37,387
- I think I saw Sarah.
- You probably did.

1017
01:14:37,945 --> 01:14:40,313
It just like her to be one of the rebels,
you should be very proud.

1018
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:43,515
How do you know who Sarah is? How do you know?!

1019
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:46,199
I know a lot more than you can imagine, Robin.

1020
01:15:02,936 --> 01:15:06,381
Okay, clear out! I got a badly injured woman here.

1021
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:10,186
[...] woman with severe head injury, what's wrong with you, people?

1022
01:15:10,269 --> 01:15:12,061
She has irreversible hallucinogenic poison,

1023
01:15:12,144 --> 01:15:13,249
now who is getting up their seat?

1024
01:15:14,106 --> 01:15:16,064
I suggest we draw straws.

1025
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:19,935
- Who are you?
- I'm from management.

1026
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:25,400
- What management?
- Hotel management.

1027
01:15:25,618 --> 01:15:27,379
Everyone here is a hotel management

1028
01:15:27,995 --> 01:15:29,600
it's powerful important people.

1029
01:15:36,712 --> 01:15:37,413
Sit.

1030
01:15:40,633 --> 01:15:41,712
Stay with me.

1031
01:15:42,969 --> 01:15:45,460
Robin, you must just stay with me,
this is very important.

1032
01:15:46,097 --> 01:15:47,046
Listen to me.

1033
01:15:47,598 --> 01:15:50,405
Don't sink, don't give up.

1034
01:15:51,477 --> 01:15:53,185
Stay awake, please.

1035
01:15:54,689 --> 01:15:56,025
I want to see my son.

1036
01:16:00,736 --> 01:16:04,060
This is his first time alone in home.

1037
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,946
As soon as we can, I'll connect you.

1038
01:16:07,285 --> 01:16:09,029
Stay awake, please.

1039
01:16:10,322 --> 01:16:11,888
Robin! Tell me about Aaron.

1040
01:16:20,047 --> 01:16:21,080
Are you Robin Wright?

1041
01:16:22,258 --> 01:16:24,186
- Yes, why? - Miramount Police.

1042
01:16:24,469 --> 01:16:25,584
Come on board.

1043
01:16:39,834 --> 01:16:42,523
Give her more oxygen, we need her alive!

1044
01:16:42,737 --> 01:16:44,113
Why keep her alive

1045
01:16:44,197 --> 01:16:46,866
if you can manufacture a thousand of old pretties

1046
01:16:46,949 --> 01:16:48,659
like that whore!

1047
01:16:48,743 --> 01:16:50,451
You fucking whore!

1048
01:16:51,182 --> 01:16:53,539
[...] what a stunning old lady she's turning into!

1049
01:16:53,623 --> 01:16:56,126
No surgery, nothing. She's a clean cut!

1050
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:58,169
You can't manufacture that!

1051
01:16:58,252 --> 01:17:00,328
We need her, keep her alive.

1052
01:17:00,546 --> 01:17:02,751
- How far from the hospital?
- We're already there!

1053
01:17:11,243 --> 01:17:13,934
AAROOOON!!

1054
01:17:22,677 --> 01:17:23,626
Who are you?

1055
01:17:25,071 --> 01:17:25,762
Dylan.

1056
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,402
Dylan Truliner.

1057
01:17:28,991 --> 01:17:31,862
- Do you work for them?
- I used to.

1058
01:17:32,411 --> 01:17:33,907
Until this morning, when they...

1059
01:17:34,664 --> 01:17:37,452
...declared the Futurist Congress revolution.

1060
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:42,582
I am the animator.

1061
01:17:42,797 --> 01:17:45,466
We moved you on the computers for 20 years.

1062
01:17:53,182 --> 01:17:55,637
Head of the Robin Wright department in Miramount.

1063
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:02,066
Your body,

1064
01:18:03,216 --> 01:18:04,929
your face, your smile,

1065
01:18:06,237 --> 01:18:07,613
your sadness...

1066
01:18:09,073 --> 01:18:11,996
That was my whole life for the past 20 years.

1067
01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:14,694
Tell me more.

1068
01:18:16,995 --> 01:18:18,700
I was unemployed animator.

1069
01:18:18,784 --> 01:18:21,277
They put me in Robin Department
for the first film,

1070
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:24,629
"Triple R Strike".

1071
01:18:26,193 --> 01:18:27,794
I was lost.

1072
01:18:28,217 --> 01:18:29,084
Why?

1073
01:18:30,263 --> 01:18:32,504
Because I had no clue who you were.

1074
01:18:33,596 --> 01:18:35,847
I've never seen your anything.

1075
01:18:36,476 --> 01:18:38,801
I had to research you.

1076
01:18:39,471 --> 01:18:40,439
Obsessively.

1077
01:18:40,715 --> 01:18:42,391
What was he looking for?

1078
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,247
Where you came from, where you went.

1079
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:49,453
Texas, the all-American girl,
tight jeans and boots.

1080
01:18:51,032 --> 01:18:52,147
After...

1081
01:18:52,742 --> 01:18:54,070
a week, I came

1082
01:18:54,577 --> 01:18:56,618
and pitched them the lasso idea, I had a little

1083
01:18:56,701 --> 01:18:59,404
illustration, drawn in pencil.

1084
01:19:06,088 --> 01:19:08,549
The rebels! They've taken over management!

1085
01:19:08,633 --> 01:19:10,802
- What management?
- Miramount-Nagasaki.

1086
01:19:10,885 --> 01:19:12,470
They've taken over the management floor,

1087
01:19:12,553 --> 01:19:14,374
and stopped the chemistry flow!

1088
01:19:14,457 --> 01:19:16,057
We gonna be real again!

1089
01:19:29,314 --> 01:19:31,257
How do I know if I'm dreaming?

1090
01:19:33,146 --> 01:19:34,710
Do you know what my dreams are?

1091
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:36,663
Robin?

1092
01:19:41,999 --> 01:19:43,273
Can you see my dream?

1093
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:49,881
4 cockroaches playing poker
on your lap, it's a dream?

1094
01:19:50,716 --> 01:19:51,275
Yes

1095
01:19:52,451 --> 01:19:53,400
but it's not mine.

1096
01:19:57,056 --> 01:19:58,634
Did any of you...

1097
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:01,043
think about me that whole time?
About what I went through

1098
01:20:01,127 --> 01:20:02,426
till after I sold myself</ i>

1099
01:20:02,812 --> 01:20:05,766
Well, I was... obsessed with you for years.

1100
01:20:05,976 --> 01:20:08,818
- With her, not with me.
- For me, it's the same thing.

1101
01:20:09,735 --> 01:20:10,981
At some point,

1102
01:20:11,487 --> 01:20:13,480
I was... dried up.

1103
01:20:14,365 --> 01:20:16,610
I was afraid they'd take you away from me,

1104
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,488
give you to some...

1105
01:20:18,911 --> 01:20:21,664
up-coming... young genius.

1106
01:20:23,124 --> 01:20:26,443
I've been looking for you all over California.
I needed new...

1107
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:28,370
Movements.

1108
01:20:28,588 --> 01:20:30,083
A different sensuality,

1109
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:32,172
things a woman gains...

1110
01:20:32,425 --> 01:20:33,554
with age.

1111
01:20:46,256 --> 01:20:49,559
Target on. Vicinity 0.3 miles. Over.

1112
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:56,409
Bomb hatch dysfunction. Over.

1113
01:20:56,574 --> 01:20:58,704
Bomb hatch dysfunction. Over.

1114
01:21:02,705 --> 01:21:06,157
Let me go now, man. I'll take care
of this situation.

1115
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:49,209
Where is everyone?

1116
01:21:49,585 --> 01:21:50,965
They hallucinated themselves out,

1117
01:21:52,088 --> 01:21:53,085
to freedom!

1118
01:21:54,465 --> 01:21:55,723
Where is Dylan?

1119
01:21:55,883 --> 01:21:57,591
Oh, he went with the flow.

1120
01:22:03,266 --> 01:22:05,057
Why am I the only one left?

1121
01:22:06,141 --> 01:22:07,977
Because you're fucked up again.

1122
01:22:08,187 --> 01:22:10,311
What exactly was going through your mind
when you got on that stage?

1123
01:22:10,898 --> 01:22:11,895
What do you mean?

1124
01:22:12,413 --> 01:22:14,496
You invited me, you said I was the symbol.

1125
01:22:14,861 --> 01:22:16,735
Symbol? Symbol of what?

1126
01:22:17,572 --> 01:22:19,980
The chemical revolution, Jeff, you said.

1127
01:22:20,064 --> 01:22:22,313
You are not a symbol. You're nothing!

1128
01:22:23,269 --> 01:22:25,066
The symbol is what we created of you.

1129
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,174
Robin, look at yourself. Does that look
like a symbol?

1130
01:22:34,286 --> 01:22:36,534
It was suicide what you did up there on stage

1131
01:22:37,508 --> 01:22:39,798
You left us no choice.

1132
01:23:17,882 --> 01:23:19,128
How do you like it?

1133
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,687
A bullet to the head.

1134
01:23:24,914 --> 01:23:25,605
One.

1135
01:23:26,637 --> 01:23:27,798
But quick.

1136
01:23:29,731 --> 01:23:32,808
Quick as possible, I just want to get out
of this hallucination.

1137
01:23:35,775 --> 01:23:37,436
After all these years,

1138
01:23:37,944 --> 01:23:40,322
it is time you knew that this is no hallucination.

1139
01:23:42,532 --> 01:23:43,519
This is our lives.

1140
01:23:44,303 --> 01:23:45,096
Robin.

1141
01:24:07,306 --> 01:24:09,797
The following case is particularly interesting.

1142
01:24:10,226 --> 01:24:13,066
The patient, who some of you might know,
was an actress once.

1143
01:24:13,502 --> 01:24:14,844
I forget her name.

1144
01:24:15,523 --> 01:24:18,685
She suffered severe hallucinogenic contamination

1145
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:20,604
During the Abrahama uprising.

1146
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:23,267
[...] In 4 months now, she is being convinced that her life

1147
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:25,815
everything she has experienced,

1148
01:24:26,325 --> 01:24:28,070
is all a hallucination.

1149
01:24:28,411 --> 01:24:29,588
It was so extreme,

1150
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:32,622
that the the rescue forces reached Abrahama,

1151
01:24:32,858 --> 01:24:34,230
she begged the chief fireman

1152
01:24:34,314 --> 01:24:36,745
to put a bullet in her head.

1153
01:24:37,295 --> 01:24:39,335
She's a lost case, hopeless.

1154
01:24:39,797 --> 01:24:41,790
So much [...] that we've decided to freeze her.

1155
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:46,968
With today's advancements of liquid nitrogen
can easily keep her frozen for 70 years.

1156
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,968
Bring it down.

1157
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:48,422
Aaron?

1158
01:25:49,933 --> 01:25:50,725
Aaron?

1159
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:06,337
Aaron, you heard me!

1160
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:08,183
You heard me calling you!

1161
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:10,884
Yeah, Mom, I heard you. Of course I did.

1162
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,137
What's so weird about that?

1163
01:26:48,092 --> 01:26:50,085
And now for the weather.

1164
01:26:50,386 --> 01:26:52,190
The Weather Company apologizes

1165
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:54,465
for the lack of complete symmetry of the rainbows

1166
01:26:54,549 --> 01:26:56,941
for the past 2 days. On the other hand,

1167
01:26:57,429 --> 01:26:59,086
symmetry contradicts art.

1168
01:27:13,078 --> 01:27:13,897
Robin...

1169
01:27:15,132 --> 01:27:18,245
You must release your mind from the thoughts.

1170
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:23,162
I do not understand.

1171
01:27:23,836 --> 01:27:24,785
What?

1172
01:27:26,297 --> 01:27:28,797
I was first to wake up in the distant future.

1173
01:27:32,776 --> 01:27:35,671
It's like bringing a diver back from the bends.

1174
01:27:36,557 --> 01:27:39,725
You have to start as far away as possible,

1175
01:27:39,936 --> 01:27:42,475
with the things you know from childhood.

1176
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:47,181
This is the setup we chose for you.

1177
01:27:47,485 --> 01:27:49,362
The early 1980s.

1178
01:27:51,948 --> 01:27:53,229
But now, Robin,

1179
01:27:54,692 --> 01:27:56,283
you have a visitor.

1180
01:27:56,676 --> 01:27:58,743
Do you feel ready for him?

1181
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,085
What are you doing here?

1182
01:28:13,386 --> 01:28:14,465
I waited for you.

1183
01:28:14,887 --> 01:28:16,292
- For me?
- Yes.

1184
01:28:18,391 --> 01:28:21,431
For the moment that you could be... thawed.

1185
01:28:21,734 --> 01:28:23,845
When medicine could advance enough

1186
01:28:23,929 --> 01:28:25,261
to fix you.

1187
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:28,859
- You waited for me all those years?
- Yes.

1188
01:28:30,611 --> 01:28:32,327
I was the last person to see you,

1189
01:28:32,723 --> 01:28:34,489
I had a responsibility.

1190
01:28:37,971 --> 01:28:39,655
They say Sarah's fine.

1191
01:28:41,085 --> 01:28:44,236
She was saved from the Abrahama revolt,
whatever that means.

1192
01:28:46,586 --> 01:28:48,875
And now, they're looking for...

1193
01:28:49,797 --> 01:28:50,669
my Aaron.

1194
01:28:57,614 --> 01:29:00,811
This is Aaron's original DNA listing.

1195
01:29:01,326 --> 01:29:03,394
I've been looking for him for a very long time.

1196
01:29:03,478 --> 01:29:05,387
since I knew they were about to thaw you.
- And?

1197
01:29:08,858 --> 01:29:09,637
There is no sign.

1198
01:29:11,098 --> 01:29:12,166
No trace.

1199
01:29:13,404 --> 01:29:15,704
I don't... think he is with us anymore.

1200
01:29:15,788 --> 01:29:18,346
What do you mean, "not with us?" What do you,
what you mean - in this world?

1201
01:29:18,826 --> 01:29:20,653
Or that he's not alive, what are you saying?

1202
01:29:20,736 --> 01:29:22,704
What are you saying, he's... he's dead?

1203
01:29:22,787 --> 01:29:24,796
It's much more complicated, Robin.

1204
01:29:24,957 --> 01:29:27,017
The world... today

1205
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,467
is unlike the world you came from.

1206
01:29:30,303 --> 01:29:33,084
To find Aaron, alive or not,

1207
01:29:33,729 --> 01:29:36,124
we have to go on a very long journey.

1208
01:29:38,054 --> 01:29:40,462
What do you think, there is a direction?
There is a clue?

1209
01:29:41,808 --> 01:29:42,721
I hope so.

1210
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,836
But we have to start somewhere.

1211
01:29:48,606 --> 01:29:50,899
I'm here to take you out into the Big City.

1212
01:30:28,813 --> 01:30:31,536
No one told me for how long I've been frozen.

1213
01:30:34,235 --> 01:30:36,904
Could have been a year, could have been 20.

1214
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:43,858
Time is now a subjective matter.

1215
01:30:44,078 --> 01:30:45,566
You decide in your mind,

1216
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:47,367
when day breaks,

1217
01:30:47,582 --> 01:30:48,851
or when the moon fades.

1218
01:30:51,419 --> 01:30:55,825
After a while you probably lose the
numeric calendar, as we once knew it.

1219
01:31:11,314 --> 01:31:14,388
New York is now a city of suspended gardens.

1220
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:18,824
They reach the sky, the wild colors they strike you [...],

1221
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:21,024
and the people are so beautiful,

1222
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:23,151
so young and radiant.

1223
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:27,780
Exuding serenity in beauty and sexuality.

1224
01:31:31,375 --> 01:31:32,918
There is no more ego.

1225
01:31:33,574 --> 01:31:35,752
Thanks to Chemistry we've been redeemed.

1226
01:31:36,589 --> 01:31:37,673
There is no ego,

1227
01:31:37,757 --> 01:31:39,926
no competition, no violence, no war,

1228
01:31:40,009 --> 01:31:41,587
no strong or weak,

1229
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:43,384
or secrets.

1230
01:31:44,222 --> 01:31:45,365
Everyone is...

1231
01:31:46,766 --> 01:31:48,261
what they are.

1232
01:31:48,768 --> 01:31:50,844
Everyone is what they want to be.

1233
01:31:51,312 --> 01:31:54,350
And while they consume their new personality,

1234
01:31:54,565 --> 01:31:57,983
they spread in the air those
pheromones that your mind

1235
01:31:58,361 --> 01:32:00,567
translates into an image.

1236
01:32:04,367 --> 01:32:07,451
There is no way I can imagine Aaron in this world.

1237
01:32:23,845 --> 01:32:27,022
This street holds the wisdom of a millennium.

1238
01:32:27,266 --> 01:32:30,762
A year ago, when I was consuming
Greek mythology

1239
01:32:32,145 --> 01:32:35,013
I woke up half-man, half-God.

1240
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,651
I impregnated one of Zeus's daughters,

1241
01:32:38,734 --> 01:32:40,727
I- I burned an entire city

1242
01:32:40,945 --> 01:32:44,190
and then I fucked this city, and then
I burned it and I punished it.

1243
01:32:44,407 --> 01:32:45,680
It's all about feelings.

1244
01:33:32,317 --> 01:33:33,719
Just make a choice

1245
01:33:35,416 --> 01:33:37,955
and you feel whatever you want.

1246
01:33:39,504 --> 01:33:41,836
What do you choose, Robin?

1247
01:33:43,626 --> 01:33:44,631
Usher syndrome.

1248
01:33:48,529 --> 01:33:50,077
What level of Usher syndrome?

1249
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,471
I think, it's Type 2,

1250
01:33:54,162 --> 01:33:55,194
Why do you need this?

1251
01:33:55,918 --> 01:33:57,936
- Are you researching someone?
- No.

1252
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:00,898
'I'm missing someone.

1253
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:57,290
May you build ladder to the star...

1254
01:34:57,957 --> 01:35:00,496
climb on every...

1255
01:35:00,877 --> 01:35:02,953
may you stay...

1256
01:35:07,258 --> 01:35:09,548
...forever young.

1257
01:35:13,848 --> 01:35:15,826
Somewhere, out there.

1258
01:35:16,974 --> 01:35:17,619
there is Sarah.

1259
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:20,953
She's a naturalist now.

1260
01:35:23,561 --> 01:35:25,163
No-no-no. Don't, don't.

1261
01:35:25,247 --> 01:35:26,935
Won't do you any good.

1262
01:35:27,361 --> 01:35:29,412
You'll never be able to recognize where [...]

1263
01:35:30,156 --> 01:35:31,568
Don't know who you are, anyway.

1264
01:35:33,034 --> 01:35:34,315
Trust me,

1265
01:35:35,286 --> 01:35:36,947
Robin, she is happy.

1266
01:35:38,414 --> 01:35:40,098
This is one of the only people who still

1267
01:35:40,182 --> 01:35:42,825
brings children into the world.

1268
01:38:43,933 --> 01:38:46,572
What if I don't want to take part
in the chemical party?

1269
01:38:49,147 --> 01:38:50,854
Then you'll realise very soon

1270
01:38:50,938 --> 01:38:52,181
that you can't.

1271
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,191
Because you won't be part of this world.

1272
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:56,106
And where will I be?

1273
01:38:57,155 --> 01:38:58,401
On the other side.

1274
01:38:58,781 --> 01:39:00,325
What's on the other side, Dylan?

1275
01:39:01,242 --> 01:39:01,855
Truth.

1276
01:39:03,452 --> 01:39:05,197
And who is on the other side?

1277
01:39:06,247 --> 01:39:08,371
Ones who did not pass over.

1278
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:10,675
who aren't taking part in the chemical party,

1279
01:39:10,759 --> 01:39:14,212
And of course, everyone who operates
the world, you see here.

1280
01:39:20,582 --> 01:39:21,716
Have you been there?

1281
01:39:22,388 --> 01:39:23,835
- No.
- Why not?

1282
01:39:24,432 --> 01:39:26,176
Because I don't know if you can get back.

1283
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,470
It's like coming back from death.

1284
01:39:29,937 --> 01:39:32,690
Maybe some have, but... we'll never know.

1285
01:39:32,773 --> 01:39:36,019
Then send me there, and I'll tell you
what it's like  on the other side.

1286
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:40,573
Do you have a way to send me there?

1287
01:39:45,802 --> 01:39:46,355
Yes.

1288
01:39:47,944 --> 01:39:50,187
- Is it at home - the substance?
- It's...

1289
01:39:50,659 --> 01:39:52,235
...not a chemical cocktail.

1290
01:39:53,059 --> 01:39:54,220
It's kind of a, a...

1291
01:39:55,463 --> 01:39:56,126
Wipeout.

1292
01:39:57,381 --> 01:40:00,990
That deletes all the chemical influences
in a second.

1293
01:40:02,386 --> 01:40:06,053
And the truth... comes right out.

1294
01:40:08,351 --> 01:40:09,264
And where is it?

1295
01:40:21,339 --> 01:40:24,565
It's like the cyanide capsules the Nazis had,

1296
01:40:26,202 --> 01:40:27,661
in case of surrender.

1297
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:30,646
When I left the old world

1298
01:40:31,249 --> 01:40:32,147
I took one.

1299
01:40:34,293 --> 01:40:35,461
It was my compensation

1300
01:40:35,545 --> 01:40:37,003
from Miramount-Nagasaki

1301
01:40:37,087 --> 01:40:39,643
that's what I asked them for after 20 years of work.

1302
01:40:40,251 --> 01:40:41,668
This little capsule.

1303
01:40:45,263 --> 01:40:46,342
I want it.

1304
01:40:50,726 --> 01:40:52,704
And if your son comes back, while you're gone?

1305
01:40:52,788 --> 01:40:55,565
And if he's there? What if he is
on the other side? That's more likely.

1306
01:40:56,274 --> 01:40:57,583
This is all I have left.

1307
01:40:58,201 --> 01:40:59,301
Robin, if you take it,

1308
01:40:59,828 --> 01:41:01,231
you are leaving, you are leaving me.

1309
01:41:01,314 --> 01:41:02,495
You can't do that.

1310
01:41:03,547 --> 01:41:04,394
Not now.

1311
01:41:04,581 --> 01:41:06,033
Then come with me.

1312
01:41:06,325 --> 01:41:09,085
I can't, the capsule is strong enough
only for one person.

1313
01:41:12,165 --> 01:41:14,496
It's your choice, and I'll give you
anything you want.

1314
01:41:18,212 --> 01:41:19,212
I love you.

1315
01:41:19,672 --> 01:41:21,924
Robin, I have always loved you.

1316
01:41:22,008 --> 01:41:23,799
I loved you for 20 years

1317
01:41:24,192 --> 01:41:27,012
when I did not even know you, and you
were my entire world.

1318
01:41:27,472 --> 01:41:29,298
And I loved you for 20 more years

1319
01:41:29,515 --> 01:41:31,057
waiting every hour

1320
01:41:31,141 --> 01:41:33,011
of every day for you to come back.

1321
01:41:43,779 --> 01:41:45,458
Promise me you not gonna look at the real me.

1322
01:41:46,491 --> 01:41:48,610
Promise me you'll remember me this way.

1323
01:41:53,333 --> 01:41:54,253
I promise.

1324
01:41:57,210 --> 01:41:58,224
I love you.

1325
01:44:18,476 --> 01:44:20,693
Are there any doctors left in this world?

1326
01:44:22,688 --> 01:44:24,100
Yes, there are.

1327
01:44:24,315 --> 01:44:25,597
Where are they?

1328
01:44:27,985 --> 01:44:29,314
Up above.

1329
01:47:00,304 --> 01:47:01,134
Excuse me.

1330
01:47:04,433 --> 01:47:07,158
Can you tell me where I can find an ENT

1331
01:47:07,241 --> 01:47:09,345
physician named Dr. Barker?

1332
01:47:10,273 --> 01:47:11,139
Sure.

1333
01:47:11,357 --> 01:47:13,267
His cabin will be at the end of the corridor.

1334
01:47:55,985 --> 01:47:58,904
- I knew you would never cross over
to the other side.
- Oh!

1335
01:48:00,031 --> 01:48:02,700
Do not be so impressed that I am still here.

1336
01:48:03,534 --> 01:48:06,073
Being here, on this side of the truth,

1337
01:48:06,412 --> 01:48:08,120
is not so brave.

1338
01:48:28,434 --> 01:48:30,367
Nothing has really changed, has it?

1339
01:48:31,145 --> 01:48:33,850
Once we just masked the truth with...

1340
01:48:34,232 --> 01:48:35,863
antidepressants, drugs

1341
01:48:35,947 --> 01:48:37,964
that, um... concealed, lied.

1342
01:48:38,710 --> 01:48:40,175
Now we reinvent the truth.

1343
01:48:41,125 --> 01:48:42,650
It's not such a big difference.

1344
01:48:43,449 --> 01:48:46,368
Drugs were just cut much, much better.

1345
01:48:48,277 --> 01:48:51,142
And is there... no choice?

1346
01:48:54,377 --> 01:48:56,198
The only choice is between

1347
01:48:56,282 --> 01:48:58,171
waiting for death here

1348
01:48:58,881 --> 01:49:01,376
in this filth of truth,

1349
01:49:01,801 --> 01:49:04,174
or hallucinating over there.

1350
01:49:06,722 --> 01:49:09,724
Maybe it's better over there, dreaming.

1351
01:49:14,313 --> 01:49:15,276
And Aaron?

1352
01:49:27,618 --> 01:49:29,944
Aaron [awaited] here,

1353
01:49:30,454 --> 01:49:32,080
all over the years.

1354
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:37,167
For 19 years, he waited for you to come back.

1355
01:49:42,008 --> 01:49:44,712
His condition got worse and worse, and, um...

1356
01:49:46,095 --> 01:49:48,504
he was almost totally blind, by the end.

1357
01:49:49,265 --> 01:49:50,381
But he...

1358
01:49:50,791 --> 01:49:52,165
He did not cross over.

1359
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,200
Even though I told him to.

1360
01:49:56,467 --> 01:50:00,554
I begged him to, [knowing] that I wouldn't
be here forever [...] to take care of him.

1361
01:50:05,531 --> 01:50:08,402
Six months ago, he crossed over

1362
01:50:10,203 --> 01:50:11,453
He is someone else now

1363
01:50:12,705 --> 01:50:16,537
in the world of chemical fantasy,
over on the other side.

1364
01:50:21,159 --> 01:50:22,707
6 months it is?

1365
01:50:23,549 --> 01:50:25,506
Exactly 6 months ago.

1366
01:50:26,552 --> 01:50:28,379
He just broke down, Robin.

1367
01:50:29,222 --> 01:50:32,176
I think he thought that I was going to die and...

1368
01:50:33,110 --> 01:50:35,202
He no longer believed that you would ever come back.

1369
01:50:52,662 --> 01:50:55,414
Basically there is no way to find Aaron.

1370
01:50:57,625 --> 01:50:59,784
Here, he does not exist.

1371
01:51:00,753 --> 01:51:03,806
And on the other side, there is no way
of knowing who he is now.

1372
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,086
But you can still go back there,

1373
01:51:09,303 --> 01:51:10,383
and that's something to.

1374
01:51:11,931 --> 01:51:13,541
That's better than waiting for death.

1375
01:51:19,522 --> 01:51:21,049
And on this other side...

1376
01:51:22,108 --> 01:51:23,733
Yeah, what about it?

1377
01:51:25,366 --> 01:51:27,283
Can I go back to where I came from?

1378
01:51:30,867 --> 01:51:34,284
There is no such thing as "the place
that you came from".

1379
01:51:36,247 --> 01:51:38,038
You invented it.

1380
01:51:40,126 --> 01:51:42,295
You will go where your mind

1381
01:51:42,378 --> 01:51:44,228
and your chemistry will take you.

1382
01:51:45,339 --> 01:51:47,049
And after your experience of here, there

1383
01:51:47,133 --> 01:51:49,672
will be a place in your consciousness

1384
01:51:49,927 --> 01:51:51,295
completely different from any

1385
01:51:51,379 --> 01:51:52,501
you have been to before.

1386
01:51:55,766 --> 01:51:57,843
Your past is dead, Robin.

1387
01:52:07,278 --> 01:52:08,445
I'll fix you an ampule.

1388
01:52:09,365 --> 01:52:11,571
And then I will call the kite.

1389
01:52:45,942 --> 01:52:47,852
Do you know where you're going, Robin?

1390
01:52:50,947 --> 01:52:51,984
Yes, I know.
