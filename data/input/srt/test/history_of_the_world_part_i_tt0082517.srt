00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,409
20 million years ago,

2
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,370
an apelike creature
inhabited the earth.

3
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,498
[Also Sprach Zarathustra
playing]

4
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,022
And the ape stood
and became man.

5
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,499
-Rrr!
-Arrgh!

6
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,897
-Ahh...
-Ahh...

7
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,969
The greatest calamity
that could befall early man

8
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,513
was the loss of fire.

9
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,391
Fire-- the mysterious phenomenon
that cooked his food,

10
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,352
heated his cave,
and kept him alive.

11
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,313
If he could not
start a fire,

12
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,816
he and his would surely die.

13
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,381
Even in most primitive man,

14
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,968
the need to create
was part of his nature.

15
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,012
This need,this talent

16
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,973
clearly separated
early man from animals,

17
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,642
who would never know this gift.

18
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,440
And here, in a cave

19
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,984
somewhere in
the North American continent

20
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,028
about 2 million years ago,

21
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,906
the first artist was born.

22
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:20,385
And, of course,
with the birth of the artist,

23
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,097
came the inevitable
after birth...

24
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,682
The critic.

25
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,911
In the year 1 million BC,

26
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,498
it is thought the first
homo sapien marriage occurred.

27
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:03,387
It was shortly followed by
the first homosexual marriage.

28
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,395
One of the first weapons
man invented

29
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,438
was the spear.

30
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,940
[Pfftt!]

31
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,317
[Pfftt!]

32
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,003
Aah!

33
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,383
Aah...Ah ah...

34
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,980
Ohh...Ah--

35
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,941
In ancient times,
man was ignorant

36
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,986
as to the cause
and nature of death,

37
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,907
so death was greeted
with a certain degree of awe.

38
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,576
-Aw...
-Aw...

39
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,953
Bungwa.

40
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,831
But because man
did not have the time

41
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,875
for complicated rituals,

42
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,753
funeral services
were often brief.

43
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,379
-Aah!
-Aah!

44
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,506
[Thud]

[Ptooey]
[Ptooey]

46
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,387
Even in early man,

47
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,475
the need to laugh was vital
for emotional survival.

48
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,031
Rrrr!

49
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,411
Aaaghh! Aah!

50
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,455
-Ha ha!
-Ha ha!

51
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,882
Aahhhh!

52
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,927
Music began
long before it was formalized

53
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,887
into notes and phrases.

54
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,432
For mankind, it began
with an accident.

55
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,435
Goonga heard the sound
and liked it.

56
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,397
Goonga begged Gowi
to repeat the beautiful scream,

57
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
but Gowi could not.

58
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,484
So Goonga thought and thought,

59
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,945
and finally he found the answer.

60
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,448
Ahha aha ah--

61
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,910
Aaahhh--

62
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:37,040
Aah ah ah ah!

63
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,918
Aaahh--

64
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,378
Aaahhh!

65
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,422
Aahahah!

66
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,382
Wooh ahhh...

67
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,304
And so, music was born.

68
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,347
Hallelujah

69
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,433
Hallelujah

70
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,476
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Halle-lu-jah!

Owh owh owh owhh!

73
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,405
Moses went to the mountain,

74
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,532
and God spoke unto him.

75
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,454

thy God,

76

commanding you to obey my law!

Nothing. Forget it.

Oh, Lord,why have You
chosen me?

What would You
have me do for you?

I shall give you my laws,

unto the people.

00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,482
He'll never survive!

676
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:25,495
-Ooh!
-Oh!

677
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,414
The jig is up!

678
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,790
And gone!

679
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,168
After him!

680
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,795
Go on, men, get him!

681
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,714
Quick. Back through
the corridor.

682
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:37,758
He's heading for the Senate.

683
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:40,802
We can meet him
near the cloakroom.

684
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:02,241
In pectorum, quid pro quo.

685
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:05,202
In pecuniam,
sic transit gloria.

686
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:08,205
I didn't know
Gloria was sick.

687
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:09,706
Where is he?

688
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,793
Don't worry.
He has to come this way.

689
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:14,753
He should have been here.

690
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,755
The Senate is in session.

691
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:20,384
All fellow members
of the Roman Senate, hear me.

692
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:23,303
Shall we continue
to build palace after palace

693
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:24,805
for the rich,

694
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:28,225
or shall we aspire
to a more noble purpose

695
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:30,769
and build housing
for the poor?

696
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,855
How does the Senate vote?

697
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,275
ALL: Fuck the poor!

698
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:37,901
Good.

699
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:43,782
Oh! Josephus.

700
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:47,786
The man was dead
when I got there, I swear!

701
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:50,747
Where you been? Who was dead?

702
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:53,750
How do we get out of here?

703
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,252
Put this on.

704
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,797
I'll find Swiftus then meet you
at the theater.

705
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,633
The theater just
across from the baths.

706
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,218
Good-bye.

707
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,137
Stop with the good-byes!

708
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:09,183
If we do escape,
will you come with us?

709
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,809
Of course.

710
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,728
Of course. Of course!

711
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,188
Good-bye.

712
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:16,690
Of course! She's coming with us!

713
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:18,942
She's coming with us.

714
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:21,195
There's some of the senators.

715
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:24,198
Right behind these guys.
Here we go.

716
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:25,657
Bullshit.

717
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:27,284
Bullshit.

718
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:42,716
Give to Oedipus!

719
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,760
[Bang]

720
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,179
Give to Oedipus!

721
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:48,764
[Bang]

722
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:50,807
Hey,Josephus!

723
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,351
Hey, motherfucker.

724
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:56,063
SONG: Funky town

725
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,940
Won't you take me to

726
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,900
Funky town?

727
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,944
Won't you take me to

728
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:03,570
Funky town?

729
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:21,255
They should have been here
over 30 grains ago!

730
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,133
What could be keeping them?

731
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,718
I don't know.

732
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:31,223
There they are! Come on!

733
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:32,724
Come on.

734
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,893
Now, hurry. Walk this way.

735
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,990
Hurry. Get into
these Trojan costumes.

736
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:52,953
...punching a hole
in the left.

737
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:55,831
Keep punching a hole
in the right.

738
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:58,375
Keep punching a hole,
let's fight!

739
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:02,212
Relax. Casual. Casual.

740
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:05,299
No matter what happens,
don't panic.

741
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,134
Don't panic.

742
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:10,345
Keep punching a hole
in the left.

743
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,723
Keep punching a hole
in the right.

744
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,224
There they are!

745
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:15,851
Panic!

746
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,311
-Oh!
-Aah!

747
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:20,272
Keep punching a hole
in the left.

748
00:41:20,272 --> 00:41:22,357
Keep punching a hole...

749
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:26,820
Captain Mucus!
Let's get after them.

750
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,864
You take the left flank.

751
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,282
[Bang]

752
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:32,784
Don't you know your left flank
from your right flank?

753
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,746
I flunked flank.

754
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:38,290
Get the funk out of here.

755
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,338
Here. This way.

756
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,766
Chemist, help me. I'm looking
for a pack of Trojans.

757
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:58,143
Gee, I just ran out.

758
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,896
Captain Mucus.

759
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:03,357
Captain Mucus,
have you found anything?

760
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,400
Nothing, Commander, nothing!

761
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,778
Search all the market places,
the square.

762
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:11,323
Half you men search
that area over there.

763
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:14,409
And the others
will run with Mucus.

764
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,040
We've got to get out of Rome.

765
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:20,707
But how?

766
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:24,962
The streets are crawling
with soldiers.

767
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:31,885
Oh,we'll never get out of Rome.

768
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:34,012
Only a miracle can save us.

769
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:36,390
Neigh!

770
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,850
Miracle!

771
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:39,351
Miracle!

772
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:40,269
Miracle!

773
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:41,895
Neigh!

774
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:44,106
We gotta get to that wagon.

775
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:45,732
Wait here.

776
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,693
[Whinny]

777
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:50,487
Come on. Hurry!

778
00:42:58,495 --> 00:42:59,371
Aha!

779
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,748
No,you don't!

780
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:06,044
-Ha ha!
-Ha ha ha!

781
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:07,379
Oh, my God!

782
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:10,507
I'm fighting with card board!

783
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:12,134
Good-bye, head!

784
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:14,511
Hello, balls!

785
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,305
Oh! Ah! Oh!

786
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:17,764
Ahh haa haa!

787
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:19,266
Come on, Comicus!

788
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:21,226
Waa!

789
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:22,811
Hurry,take off!

790
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,855
Let's go, Miracle!

791
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:31,820
What--Commander.

792
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,238
Where are they?

793
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:35,282
[High voice]
Get the horses!

794
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:38,368
Get the chariots. Get the men.

795
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:40,370
Onward!

796
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,290
Get me an ice pack. Hurry!

797
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:47,628
Where you going?

798
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,171
I don't know!

799
00:43:56,929 --> 00:44:00,349
Uh-oh. Here come the bad guys.

800
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,228
Come on, Miracle, hurry.
They're gaining on us.

801
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:05,812
Hurry!

802
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:08,190
Come on, Miracle. Go, boy!

803
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:10,734
Come on! We're gaining on them!

804
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:13,403
They're gaining on us!

805
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:16,073
Come on, Miracle!

806
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:19,952
Go, boy, go! Stretch out
those long white legs!

807
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,501
We're pulling away!
We're losing them!

808
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,045
Ya! Ya!

809
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,007
Quickly! Go to the left!
Go to the right!

810
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,592
Stop!

811
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:42,307
I smell something familiar!

812
00:44:42,307 --> 00:44:44,852
Yes! Yes! I got an idea!

813
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,812
Pull over!

814
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,397
Pull over!

815
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:52,359
I knew I smelled something.

816
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,903
Are you crazy?
They're right behind us!

817
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,905
The nose knows.

818
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,074
What the heck is he--

819
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:01,618
Why is he picking flowers?

820
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,078
Roman red.

821
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:04,413
Roman red?

822
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,541
A whole field of wacky weed.

823
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,126
He's picking weeds!

824
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:12,296
Papyrus. Rolling papyrus.

825
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:14,798
Paper! Paper!

826
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:17,342
What kind of paper? Like this?

827
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:18,802
That's good.

828
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:23,515
E-Z Widers. These people
don't know the value.

829
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,184
Josephus, hurry!

830
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:37,321
Hold this.

831
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:39,281
Yes, indeed!

832
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,366
They'll be here any minute!

833
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:45,370
Not to worry. We are now armed
with mighty joint.

834
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:46,830
Mighty joint?

835
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,624
Let's go, Miracle!

836
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:51,043
Hurry! You've got to catch them!

837
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,671
Quickly! After them!

838
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:07,142
We've got to--
We've got to--

839
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:09,520
get...moving.

840
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,772
It's working!

841
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:13,106
It's working!

842
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:16,193
We got to stay loose,you know.

843
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:17,569
Let it cool--

844

01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:41,024
-Food!
-Food!

1178
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:42,693
Count de Money!

1179
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:46,113
Count de Money!

1180
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,408
Count de Money!

1181
01:05:49,408 --> 01:05:51,451
Count de Money!

1182
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:53,662
Count de Money!

1183
01:05:53,704 --> 01:05:56,498
De Monet! De Monet!

1184
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:58,876
-Count de Money!
-Count de Money!

1185
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:00,502
Aah!

1186
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:02,171
Aah!

1187
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:07,467
Aaaaah!

1188
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:10,888
We should get rid
of your tailor.

1189
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:12,931
I don't like your cuffs.

1190
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:16,393
I don't like your cuffs,
I don't like your cuffs.

1191
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:18,896
A man's cuffs should be even

1192
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:21,440
with the tip of his pee-pee.

1193
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,444
Yours are all the way down
to your balls.

1194
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:27,946
At least I have them.

1195
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:29,573
You bitch!

1196
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,160
Lackey!

1197
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:35,913
Count de Money.

1198
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,998
De Monet.

1199
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,958
Monet. Say it.

1200
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,627
Mo-nay.

1201
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:43,962
Mo-nay.

1202
01:06:43,962 --> 01:06:45,881
Perfect. Don't forget it.

1203
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:47,257
Say it again.

1204
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:48,550
Monet.

1205
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:50,052
Where's His Majesty?

1206
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:51,553
Playing chess.

1207
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:53,013
Chess?

1208
01:06:53,013 --> 01:06:54,973
I hate chess.

1209
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,477
Th-th-th!

1210
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:04,441
It's your move,Your Majesty.

1211
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:11,073
I'm quite aware of that,
you petite putz.

1212
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:15,410
I see.

1213
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:23,085
Knight to rook4!

1214
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:32,344
Your move, Popinjay.

1215
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:33,971
Yes, sire.

1216
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,848
Oh...

1217
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:43,021
Pawn threatens bishop!

1218
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:45,482
What the hell did you say?

1219
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:47,860
Pawn threatens bishop!

1220
01:07:48,026 --> 01:07:50,237
All right! I understood.

1221
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:53,240
Pawn threatens bishop.
All right, Popinjay,

1222
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,450
I'm invoking
the King's privilege.

1223
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,661
Three moves to one.

1224
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:02,583
Knight jumps Queen!

1225
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:04,918
Whoops!

1226
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:06,587
Bishop jumps Queen!

1227
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:07,921
Ah!

1228
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,051
Pawns jump Queen!

1229
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:14,595
-Oh!
-Ah!

1230
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,556
Gang bang!

1231
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:20,517
Come on, let's all
jumpthe Queen.

1232
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:25,689
Whip out those little dicks!
Here we go!

1233
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:35,949
What a spectacle.

1234
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:37,701
-Oh!
-Oh!

1235
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:39,369
-Oh!
-Oh!

1236
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:42,039
Isn't the Queen a good sport?

1237
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:43,957
And he's such a fool.

1238
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:46,919
Nevertheless,we must
do everything we can

1239
01:08:46,919 --> 01:08:50,464
to save the thing
that divine right and history

1240
01:08:50,464 --> 01:08:52,508
have placed on his head.

1241
01:08:52,508 --> 01:08:54,009
His wig?

1242
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:55,969
No,you twit, his crown--

1243
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:58,347
the symbol
of "might makes right,"

1244
01:08:58,347 --> 01:09:01,850
the thing our fortunes
and titles are attached to,

1245
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,101
the monarchy.

1246
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:04,978
-Ah!
-Oh!

1247
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:07,523
Will you speak to His Majesty?

1248
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:10,484
Perhaps later. We've had
such a bouncy journey.

1249
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:12,986
Where is the garcon de piss?

1250
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:15,697
There he is.

1251
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:19,409
Merci, monsieur.

1252
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:20,244
Piss boy!

1253
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,496
Ah, oui, monsieur!

1254
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:26,041
Oui, oui.

1255
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:28,001
Yes, a lot of it.

1256
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:29,670
S'il vous plait.

1257
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:37,010
Keep searching.
You'll find it.

1258
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,013
Leave me alone.
I can handle this.

1259
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:42,975
[Tinkling]

1260
01:09:42,975 --> 01:09:44,476
Ah!

1261
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:53,360
You look familiar.
Who do you look like?

1262
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,279
Je ne sais pas.

1263
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,699
Who is that girl?

1264
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:01,243
She's gorgeous.

1265
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:08,500
Pardon, pardon, pardon.

1266
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,960
Yes?

1267
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:12,504
You are pissing on my shoe.

1268
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:14,464
Sorry. Mind your pail!

1269
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,008
Sorry.

1270
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:20,512
[Tinkling stops]

1271
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:22,556
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

1272
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:25,100
Wait for the shake.

1273
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,602
[Tinkle]

1274
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:30,189
There,there.

1275
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:32,524
That's for you.

1276
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:34,568
Piss off.

1277
01:10:34,568 --> 01:10:37,112
Thank you. I'll get it later.

1278
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:42,201
Oh,that's better.

1279
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:44,244
Let the Queen up!

1280
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:46,955
She's been so good to all of us!

1281
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:50,626
Ooh!

1282
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:52,503
Ooh!

1283
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:54,922
There's a naughty bit
of crumpet!

1284
01:10:59,343 --> 01:11:01,011
Mmm!

1285
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:04,097
Oh!

1286
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:05,557
Your Majesty.

1287
01:11:05,557 --> 01:11:07,392
How's it going, Marie?

1288
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,983
It's good to be the King.

1289
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,487
Ah!

1290
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:21,949
Hmmm.

1291
01:11:26,537 --> 01:11:29,039
[Sniff]

1292
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:30,499
[Sniff]

1293
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:35,546
Everything's so green.

1294
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:38,549
Majesty, may I have
a word with you?

1295
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:40,592
Ooh! Care for a toot?

1296
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:41,969
Non. Merci.

1297
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:45,055
Don't indulge? Well,
that leaves more for us.

1298
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:46,682
Who are you?

1299
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:50,394
Your Majesty, I am
Mademoiselle Rimbaud.

1300
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:52,938
Mmm. Nice names.

1301
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:56,483
Tell me, my dear,
what can I do for you?

1302
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:58,402
My father, Monsieur Rimbaud,

1303
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:01,488
for 10 years has languished
in the Bastille.

1304
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:04,950
If I don't get him out soon,
he will surely die.

1305
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:08,537
I throw myself on your mercy.
Please release him.

1306
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:11,456
Why was he put
into the Bastille?

1307
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:14,418
He said something
at a royal dinner party.

1308
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:16,503
What did he say?

1309
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:19,506
He said,
"the poor ain't so bad."

1310
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:21,550
"The poor ain't so bad"!

1311
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,760
You're lucky he's still alive.

1312
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,638
Please,Your Majesty,
don't let him die.

1313
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:29,725
I'll do anything to gain
his pardon. Anything.

1314
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,518
Anything?

1315
01:12:31,518 --> 01:12:34,605
Your Majesty!
I was raised in a convent.

1316
01:12:34,605 --> 01:12:38,025
I don't indulge
in pleasures of the flesh.

1317
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:41,904
You don't put out,
he don't get out.

1318
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:45,115
But Your Majesty,
I simply don't do it.

1319
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:48,994
Come on. You do it.
You know you do it.

1320
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:52,080
We love to do it. You do it.

1321
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,582
No, I don't.

1322
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:55,083
You want to do it.

1323
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:58,879
I do it. I love to do it.

1324
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:02,508
I just did it, and I'm ready
to do it again.

1325
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:05,594
Don't tell me
you don't do it.

1326
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:09,598
You do it, or your father dies.
Hump or death.

1327
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,058
Humperdinck?

1328
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:13,602
Not Humperdinck.
Hump or death.

1329
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:15,646
You got 10 seconds

1330
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:17,606
to make up your mind.

1331
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:19,858
Hump, death. Hump, death.

1332
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:21,485
Hump, death.

1333
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:24,154
Your time is running out!

1334
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:26,532
All right, all right!
Hump! Oh!

1335
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:29,493
Very good. I'm glad
you thought it over.

1336
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:32,204
Be at my chambers at midnight.

1337
01:13:32,204 --> 01:13:34,081
A tout a I'heure.

1338
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:35,999
Wait.

1339
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:39,127
Don't wear anything...

1340
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:41,171
complicated.

1341
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:50,973
Ah.
