1
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:02,360
Hello? Hello?

2
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,176
Hello?

3
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,193
Another day.

4
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:46,821
Another day.

5
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,473
Go away.

6
00:03:59,481 --> 00:04:00,982
Go away.

7
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,329
When I say stop,
you have to... Morning.

8
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:18,954
Have a nice day.

9
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,626
Good morning, madam.

10
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,627
We at Euphoria Finance want to
put the "you" back into euphoria.

11
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,799
Your lifestyle is our concern.

12
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,877
Your dreams are our dreams.

13
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:32,215
That's why we say,
"Enough is never enough."

14
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:35,516
Call us today and ask for more.

15
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:37,845
Good morning, madam.
We at Euphoria...

16
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:41,390
Everyone's getting
rich, except you.

17
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:45,193
Learn the secrets of their
success tonight at 8 on DuMBC.

18
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:48,022
Bored with Buddhism,
sick of Scientology?

19
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,279
Then the Church of Batman the
Redeemer may be the answer.

20
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:53,986
The future has come and gone.

21
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,536
Where were you?

22
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:59,957
Don't miss out the next
time. Call 897-3434.

23
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:19,136
Occupy Mall Street now.

24
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:22,188
Autumn sales have
started. Bargains galore.

25
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:26,359
Up to 100 percent
off selected items.

26
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,359
Autumn sales have
started. Bargains galore.

27
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:32,237
Up to 100 percent
off selected items.

28
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:35,243
24 hours a day at BabyC.

29
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:37,742
We've cut out all the bad news.

30
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,791
We live in a chaotic,
confusing world.

31
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:49,250
So many choices, so little time.

32
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:51,425
What do we need?

33
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:53,299
Who do with love?

34
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:56,347
What brings us joy?

35
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,687
Mancom, making sense of
the good things in life.

36
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,651
Ahem. I hope you enjoyed
our presentation.

37
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:11,275
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

38
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,073
Now, if you'll please follow me.

39
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,198
Please stay together. Here's
your chance to observe

40
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:21,532
Mancom's proprietary Q-void
computation system in action.

41
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,163
No photos, please. Thank you.

42
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,916
We call it the power of six.

43
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,088
Six degrees of convergence,

44
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,467
providing stability for
business or personal needs.

45
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:36,547
As you can see, our company
encourages an atmosphere

46
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:40,259
of vigorous but
healthy competition.

47
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:14,424
Hello, Qohen Leth. Corporate
Health Maintenance

48
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:18,597
have approved review of your
disability request for today at 14:40.

49
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:20,219
Please be prompt.

50
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:23,267
We're nothing if not prompt.

51
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,990
All right, Quinn.

52
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,620
How's it hanging?

53
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,998
It's Qohen, Mr. Joby.

54
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,706
And as we've told you before,
it isn't hanging well. We're dying.

55
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:56,214
You should see the medics about
that. Can't afford to lose you.

56
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,592
- We have an appointment this afternoon.
- Not this afternoon.

57
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:01,137
- You approved it.
- Cancel.

58
00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:04,263
You got still the Transfinite
Paradox project due today.

59
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:06,561
Finished.

60
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,808
Pathologics division's running
the standard redundancies.

61
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,776
You do all that this morning?

62
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:16,779
As mentioned to you repeatedly,
we detest working here.

63
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,029
Considering our output, we
can't begin to understand

64
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,954
- why you insist on our coming here.
- That's a Management issue.

65
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:29,206
- It's Qohen. Q, no U, O-H-E-N.
- Out of my hands.

66
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:33,212
Then perhaps we should be
talking to Management.

67
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,382
No, no, no. Nobody
speaks to Management.

68
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,712
You know that. No way, no way.
Look, take my advice.

69
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,469
Knock off the bitching and
moaning. It's not bad.

70
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:45,433
We could accept braving
this ghastly place

71
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:47,636
were it not for fear
of missing our call.

72
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:52,350
Oh, that call, yeah. Could you not let
the machine take it or call forwarding?

73
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:56,528
I could always bend the rules
on personal calls in your case.

74
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:59,815
We have to be home to receive it.

75
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,946
Look, I'll see what I
can do, all right?

76
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:06,450
Sorry.

77
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:10,125
- We prefer not to be touched.
- All right.

78
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:16,874
Qohen Leth, ontological
research division,

79
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:20,176
requesting disability leave.

80
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:22,505
Or reassignment to work at home.

81
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:24,714
That's Management's
decision, Mr. Leth.

82
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:27,892
We only deal with
health issues here.

83
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:30,811
What seems to be the problem?

84
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:33,231
- We are dying.
- Who's we?

85
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:36,066
Us. Ourselves.

86
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:39,403
- But there's only one of you.
- So it would appear.

87
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:45,573
This subject has undergone
five physicals the last year.

88
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:47,870
He's healthy as a horse.

89
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:50,790
- My hair has fallen out.
- Perfectly normal.

90
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,787
You're the most productive
number cruncher in your unit.

91
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:57,880
Entity crunchers.

92
00:09:57,881 --> 00:10:03,087
We work with esoteric data
that have a life on their own

93
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,389
and are substantially more
complex than numbers.

94
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,309
In the experience of this board, dying
people are rarely so productive.

95
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,685
- Nevertheless, we're dying.
- No, we're not.

96
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:15,936
Yes, we are.

97
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:17,643
- No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

98
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,194
- We're not.
- Yes, we are.

99
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:21,692
- Not. Not. Not.
- Bus, bus.

100
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:23,193
May the party-party bug.

101
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,866
I'll do this one.

102
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,287
You're not dying.

103
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,913
Although, in a way,

104
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:37,746
from the moment of birth,
we all begin to die.

105
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:40,628
Call it divinely
planned obsolescence.

106
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:44,593
Soon or late, beggar or king,
death is the end of all things.

107
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:47,798
Why, life might be seen as a virus

108
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:50,384
infecting the perfect
organism of death.

109
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:53,686
That's enough, doctor.

110
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,104
It's true.

111
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:58,309
Disability request denied.
It's back to work for you.

112
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:03,360
However, this board recommends
further psychiatric evaluation.

113
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,948
I haven't time for more therapists.

114
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:09,619
I hope you'll have time for this.

115
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:15,499
Did you hear about
tonight? Changed.

116
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,748
- It's not 8, it's 7:30, right?
- Okay.

117
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,128
I'm going as a tiger.

118
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:24,968
All right, Quinn. I told you, the
medics wouldn't help. Leave it.

119
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:28,839
It's all right. Joby's on
the job. Problem solved.

120
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,803
- You're sending us home?
- One thing at a time.

121
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:35,387
I can get Management to see you.
He's coming to my party tonight.

122
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,977
- Party?
- I'll just give you the address.

123
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:40,604
You turn up and I'll do the rest.

124
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:42,026
We're afraid we can't.

125
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:44,479
What, staying in and
washing your hair?

126
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:47,110
We have to stay home,
wait for our call.

127
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,660
Look, do you want my help or not?

128
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:53,996
We fear parties.

129
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:57,249
Never quite know where to stand.

130
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:02,960
You kill me, you lunatic. You
don't know where to stand?

131
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:05,212
You gotta love it.

132
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:08,336
I'll see you tonight, Quinn.

133
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:10,297
It's Qohen.

134
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,291
Hey! Quinn!

135
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:43,003
That's the wrong way.
This way. This way.

136
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:46,253
Party. Party. Come in. Come in.

137
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:48,919
Yeah.

138
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:53,597
This is the main room,
everything's free in there.

139
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:56,392
Hello, Barbara. How you
doing, darling? All right?

140
00:12:56,393 --> 00:12:58,436
You... She can't...

141
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:00,270
You see what this is?

142
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:02,439
You see this? Know what it is?

143
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,359
That's marble. It's real marble.

144
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,277
This place is covered in it.
It's my uncle's.

145
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,234
It was my uncle's. He lost everything
in the Sit On My Facebook crash.

146
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:14,490
The removal men are coming tomorrow

147
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,537
but tonight, it's ours,

148
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:22,086
so you party. Heh. Whoo!

149
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:25,587
- Is Management here?
- Mm! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

150
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:28,587
Keep it down. You don't wanna
start a rumour, right?

151
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:30,714
- Where's Management?
- Shh.

152
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:35,591
When he gets here,
I'll let you know.

153
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:38,847
In the meantime, lighten up.
Have some fun for a change.

154
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,680
And mingle, Quinn.
Mingle, all right?

155
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,355
It's Qohen.

156
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,229
Yeah, yeah, of course.

157
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,658
Hi.

158
00:13:57,912 --> 00:13:59,830
I love the look.

159
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:02,910
Final evolution or re-product?

160
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:06,872
Maximum brain, minimalist body.

161
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,541
Excuse us.

162
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,394
Sit.

163
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,358
Now, what seems to be the problem?

164
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:12,695
We simply want to go home.

165
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,528
Home?

166
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,744
We can tell that you are a
man who values his solitude,

167
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:26,121
and we too are better
off left alone.

168
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,001
We fail to see the logic
in wasting time commuting

169
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:32,923
to a cubicle where we
work independently

170
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:36,503
amid other workers
similarly cubicled.

171
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:41,137
We could easily double
the output there

172
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,843
at home.

173
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:48,394
And our chief concern is
that we might miss our call.

174
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:53,193
You see, we've been waiting
for a call all our life now.

175
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:56,773
And, well, we've...

176
00:15:56,781 --> 00:16:00,155
The nature or the origin of our
call remains a mystery to us.

177
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,488
We can't help but hope

178
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:06,871
that it will provide us with a
purpose we've long lived without.

179
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:14,423
You're quite insane, Mr. Leth.

180
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:22,056
We're sorry to have disturbed you.

181
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,809
- Drink?
- No.

182
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,392
Drink?

183
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:36,987
Oh! Whoa, Quinn, you
chrome dome bastard.

184
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:39,530
Where are you sneaking off?
Sneaky, sneaky.

185
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,780
- Give me that coat.
- We've seen him.

186
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:44,203
- Who?
- Management.

187
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:48,074
Would you stop? Management
parties incognito.

188
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:51,035
- No, this isn't what he...
- You're blowing his cover.

189
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,917
We really must go home now.

190
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:57,297
No. Look, I'll sort something out. I'll
get you a proper meeting with him.

191
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,253
There's no way you're going
without something to eat.

192
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:01,508
It's Qohen.

193
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:05,262
- We've had, apparently, our meeting.
- Just one.

194
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:08,720
Our diet dictates against any
foods with perceptible flavour.

195
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:12,978
All right, all right, all right.
Eat, eat, eat. That's an order.

196
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,773
Plenty of eats.

197
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,822
Plenty more.

198
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,776
Plenty for everybody.

199
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,742
- All right.
- Hey. Hold. Hold it. Yeah.

200
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,746
What is the meaning
of life, Mr. Leth?

201
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,466
Ah. So close to its end
and still no answers.

202
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:46,341
I have a special project for you that
could prove to be mutually beneficial.

203
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:51,763
There's not a lot of time,
not much time at all.

204
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,548
Whoo!

205
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,845
Okay.

206
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,648
You alive in there?

207
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,196
Whoo. Are you okay?

208
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,901
Yeah?

209
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,412
Yeah.

210
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:58,663
Excuse us.

211
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:02,379
- Care to join me?
- Excuse us?

212
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,551
I won't be long.

213
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:31,992
So I saved your life.

214
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,789
So what?

215
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,543
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

216
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,712
I'm Bainsley.

217
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,041
And you are?

218
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,218
Qohen. Q, no U.

219
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,262
And you work with these people?

220
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:50,965
In a manner of speaking, yeah.

221
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:55,769
- What do you do?
- Us? We crunch entities.

222
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,065
- You got a mouse in your pocket? Heh.
- Excuse us?

223
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,892
But who's "we"?

224
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,852
Us. Ourselves.

225
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,734
Oh, catchy.

226
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,236
Hey, help!

227
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,611
You're staring at me.

228
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,163
You think my dress
is incredibly ugly?

229
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:20,585
Well, it's my daddy's fault.

230
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:25,166
He used to buy me these incredibly
ugly clothes to keep the boys away.

231
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,716
It didn't work.

232
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:29,261
Only made me wanna get naked.

233
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:32,803
And that's no way to
keep the boys away.

234
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,259
Excuse us.

235
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,435
We really must leave now.

236
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,978
No, wait.

237
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:39,852
Just wait.

238
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:41,228
Wait.

239
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,495
Did anybody ever tell you,
"Be careful what you wish for"?

240
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:58,416
- Excuse us? What's all this about?
- You're going home.

241
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:09,510
Zero theorem.

242
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:12,429
All very hush-hush.

243
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,223
Management's been handpicking
talent since before I was hired.

244
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:19,099
Nobody lasts. It's a
guaranteed burnout project.

245
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:22,227
I worked at it for about three
weeks when I was young.

246
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:23,648
Drove me balmy.

247
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,227
After Zip-T, I couldn't
crunch Coco Pops.

248
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:28,652
That's why Management
made me a supervisor.

249
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:33,109
You might've noticed I'm a few raisins
short of a full scoop. Ha-ha.

250
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:35,828
That's why he chose
you, I think. Ooh.

251
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:40,122
Nothing left to lose. The tech boys
should be around at your place now,

252
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:44,329
changing the locks, setting up the
standard at-home work force security.

253
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:47,006
I've got my money on you, Quinn.

254
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:50,550
You'll be proving that
theorem in no time.

255
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:54,513
- What exactly will we be proving?
- That Management's getting desperate.

256
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,227
Have you ever wondered where all
the stuff you crunch winds up?

257
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,687
Voilà.

258
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,197
Here. Put this on.

259
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,206
Come.

260
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,794
Neural Net Mancrive.

261
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,003
The centre of Management's
entire operation.

262
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,009
Smart as shit and still learning.

263
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:39,808
Now, be very, very quiet.

264
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:42,603
We're hunting entities.

265
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,275
Working hard, Bob,
or hardly working?

266
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:49,728
Today's the same, Bob.

267
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:54,190
Don't mind me, Bob, I'm just getting
Quinn started on the old Zipster.

268
00:22:56,284 --> 00:22:58,577
That's a waste of time, Bob.

269
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,620
I give him two weeks.

270
00:23:00,621 --> 00:23:03,449
That's Bob, summer intern.

271
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:07,579
- Why does he call you Bob?
- Oh, Bob calls everybody Bob.

272
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,754
He says it's a waste of brain
cells remembering names.

273
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:13,173
- He's a hardware specialist.
- Isn't he rather young for that?

274
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:16,219
No, that kid could programme
before he could walk.

275
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:28,775
Right. Now, here's your software.

276
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:33,445
Management will send you new
data downloads every week.

277
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:36,024
How long is this
project going to take?

278
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:39,236
Don't know. It could take forever.

279
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:44,747
When I was a little tyke, everybody
thought neutrinos had no mass.

280
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:46,915
Somebody discovered
they do have mass.

281
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:50,166
Tiny little bit of mass,
but mass is mass, right?

282
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:52,624
It's got to add up to something.

283
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,968
That stuff used to keep me awake
at night. Not that you should worry.

284
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,219
Everything's under control. You
got everything you wanted.

285
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,685
Ever get a feeling the world's
giggling behind your back?

286
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:06,387
Everybody in the universe

287
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:09,022
is in on some cosmic joke.
Everybody but you.

288
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:11,316
The only reason you're not
laughing is you're the punchline.

289
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,984
- You ever get that feeling, Quinn?
- It's Qohen.

290
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,154
Working hard, Bob,
or hardly working?

291
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,323
Well, it pays the same, Bob.

292
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,492
Pays the same.

293
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:32,539
Zero currently equals
93. 78926 percent.

294
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:35,671
Zero must equal 100 percent.

295
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:41,635
Your first instalment of processed
data is due for upload in four hours.

296
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:43,466
Good luck.

297
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,340
Yeah.

298
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,765
Hmm.

299
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:53,293
Yeah.

300
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,499
Hello, Qohen Leth.

301
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:02,507
Your next instalment of processed
data is due for upload in one hour.

302
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,228
Enter number of minutes
needed for target overrun.

303
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:50,009
Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.

304
00:26:50,017 --> 00:26:54,768
Zero currently equals
93. 789 percent.

305
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:58,522
Zero must equal 100 percent.

306
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,283
- Yeah?
- Hello, Qohen Leth.

307
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:12,285
Your next instalment of processed
data is due for upload in one hour.

308
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:15,038
If the target timetable
is attainable, press one.

309
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:17,870
If not, enter what is
needed for target overrun.

310
00:27:17,878 --> 00:27:21,252
Your next instalment of
processed data is...

311
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,973
Zero must equal 100 percent.

312
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:42,611
Zero must equal 100 percent.

313
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,649
Zero must equal 100 percent.

314
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:55,912
You seem tense, Qohen.

315
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,709
Let's return to the
subject of your fears.

316
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:07,171
In past sessions, you have reported
a fear of death, a fear of life,

317
00:28:07,177 --> 00:28:09,550
a fear of open spaces,
closed places,

318
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,097
a fear of people,
a fear of being alone,

319
00:28:12,098 --> 00:28:14,301
- a fear of missing certain...
- No.

320
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,265
We fear a great many things,
but we fear nothing most of all.

321
00:28:18,272 --> 00:28:20,773
- Please go on.
- In what manner?

322
00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:23,735
- Are you trying to be difficult?
- Not at all.

323
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:27,657
It seems we're capable of being
difficult without trying.

324
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:30,447
We've spoken about your fears.

325
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:33,119
Let's speak about your joys.

326
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,200
At present, there's very little we
can think of that brings us joy.

327
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:40,377
What brought you joy in the past?

328
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:46,338
- We recall enjoying food once.
- What was your favourite food?

329
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,752
That, we can't recall.

330
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:53,516
At present, we feel no joy.

331
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,431
What do you feel?

332
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,308
Nothing.

333
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:02,225
You're a tough nut to crack, Qohen.

334
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:05,686
And, of course, I don't mean
"nut" in the pejorative sense.

335
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,072
Let's examine...

336
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:13,990
Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.

337
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:18,158
Your next instalment of processed
data is due for upload in one hour.

338
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:20,707
- What?
- If target timetable is attainable,

339
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,377
press one. If not, ent...

340
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:26,917
Please enter number of minutes
needed for target overruns.

341
00:29:26,924 --> 00:29:30,003
One moment, please.
Management have authorised

342
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,133
- a 60-minute overrun.
- No, that...

343
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,635
- Goodbye, Mr. Leth.
- That's nothing... No.

344
00:29:35,224 --> 00:29:38,016
We can finish this session
another time, Qohen.

345
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:41,893
- I think you'd better get back to work.
- These entities refuse

346
00:29:41,897 --> 00:29:43,269
to remain crunched.

347
00:29:43,273 --> 00:29:45,851
Each has its own meaning,
but that changes

348
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:48,107
- depending on the following.
- Qohen.

349
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:50,153
- Which then changes
- Deep breath.

350
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:53,859
- depending on the meaning of...
- Deep breath in and out.

351
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:56,077
Deep breath in...

352
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,622
- and out.
- All we want is our call.

353
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,700
Yes, your call.

354
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:04,378
We'll complete this
session another time.

355
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,884
Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.

356
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:17,557
Your next instalment of
processed data is due...

357
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:20,350
Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.

358
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:24,307
Your next instalment of processed
data is due for upload in one hour.

359
00:30:24,314 --> 00:30:26,061
Hello, Qohen Leth.

360
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:29,065
Are you an entity process?

361
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,817
Have you tried them?

362
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:34,157
You should try herbs.

363
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:36,325
I'm happy with herbs.

364
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:38,619
Way happy.

365
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,994
They should put them in the
drinking water. Ha-ha-ha.

366
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:44,748
Black fluoride. Ha-ha-ha.

367
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,419
Are you here alone?

368
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:51,754
We are generally everywhere alone.

369
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:55,004
I love mystery.

370
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:57,473
Turns me on.

371
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:01,510
Well, you don't know me
and I don't know you.

372
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:02,765
No.

373
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,938
- I'm the neighbour.
- Mm-hm.

374
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,901
There's always a neighbour
at this kind of party.

375
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,112
Care to come to my place?

376
00:31:13,113 --> 00:31:18,535
We'd only disappoint you as
we have countless others.

377
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,948
That's the best line
I've heard all night.

378
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:25,208
- Thank you.
- Mm.

379
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:27,126
We must leave now.

380
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:28,749
Hey, wait.

381
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,752
Wait.

382
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,134
Don't say no.

383
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:36,674
Just think about it.

384
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:41,722
If it's not now, some other time.

385
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,896
Just have to call me.

386
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:51,317
Goodbye, Mr. Leth. Goodbye,
Mr. Leth. Goodbye, Mr. Leth.

387
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:52,815
Oh!

388
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:09,583
Next instalment of processed data
is due for upload in one hour.

389
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:12,335
If the target timetable
is attainable, press one.

390
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:15,042
If not, enter what is
needed for target overrun.

391
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,595
Please enter the number of minutes
needed for target overrun.

392
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:20,968
Zero must equal 100 percent.

393
00:32:22,182 --> 00:32:25,226
Zero must equal 100 percent.

394
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:36,355
Go like this.

395
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:42,240
Ha-ha-ha. Sideways
walks the crab, and...

396
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:50,953
Ha-ha-ha, oh!

397
00:32:57,926 --> 00:33:00,049
No. No.

398
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,556
Come on.

399
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:13,525
Yeah.

400
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:16,065
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

401
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:18,067
No, no, no!

402
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,904
- What? Not now.
- Processed data is due for upload.

403
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:25,327
Please enter number of minutes
needed for target overrun.

404
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:29,534
That timetable is not authorised.
Please enter the estimated number.

405
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:33,711
- Please enter the estimated number.
- Shut up. Shut up.

406
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,421
That timetable is not authorised.

407
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,626
- Please enter the estimated number.
- I'm gonna catch them.

408
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:43,760
That timetable is not authorised.
Please enter the estimated number.

409
00:33:43,764 --> 00:33:47,719
That timetable is not authorised.
Please enter the estimated number.

410
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,974
- No.
- Deep breaths, Qohen.

411
00:33:49,978 --> 00:33:52,259
- Not you. No, we won't breathe!
- Deep breaths, remember?

412
00:33:54,983 --> 00:33:56,525
And you too!

413
00:33:56,526 --> 00:33:58,854
No!

414
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,638
Hello?

415
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,513
Management says
you've got a problem.

416
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:56,461
Quinn, you tortured little slut,
that is. Been a long time.

417
00:34:56,837 --> 00:34:59,460
How are you? Still dying, I see.

418
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,632
- What are you doing here?
- Field work.

419
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:05,633
I love it. Gets me out of the office
into a snappy uniform. Ha, ha.

420
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:12,056
You could use a
woman's touch, Quinn.

421
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:16,227
Eh...

422
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,896
Ah. Management can't
get through to you.

423
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,272
What's the story?

424
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:24,986
At present, we have difficulty
maintaining our upload schedule.

425
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,490
The entities are
behaving very strangely.

426
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,070
Yeah.

427
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:33,995
Personnel meltdown.
I've seen plenty of it.

428
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,417
I'd pull you off the pitch

429
00:35:36,418 --> 00:35:39,292
but Management wants to
give you another chance.

430
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:41,214
Don't ask me why.

431
00:35:41,798 --> 00:35:43,500
Ooh.

432
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:46,090
Phone trouble, was it?

433
00:35:46,094 --> 00:35:48,922
Tried to fix it yourself, did you?

434
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:55,766
Wrong tool for the job.

435
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,392
Ball-peen's more for hammering
out dents in sheet metal,

436
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:02,148
not for close tolerance
phone repair.

437
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:08,024
It's all about connections, Quinn.

438
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:15,826
Wires, wireless, weaving
a World Wide Web.

439
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:18,956
Can't get anything if
you're disconnected.

440
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:22,873
Voilà.

441
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:26,960
Tell you what, this manual
work's giving me a thirst.

442
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:29,762
You've not got a beer for
a working man, have you?

443
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:31,089
We have tap water.

444
00:36:31,098 --> 00:36:32,800
Yum-yum.

445
00:36:38,313 --> 00:36:40,060
Thank you.

446
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,440
I miss you, Quinn.

447
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,823
Supervisors don't
make many friends.

448
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:57,366
- You consider us a friend?
- Yeah, of course I do.

449
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:59,785
Of course I do.

450
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:04,088
So, what's the real problem?

451
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:09,590
The zero theorem is unproveable.

452
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:13,215
We still haven't
received our phone call.

453
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:15,425
You don't trust Management.

454
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,011
Nothing adds up.

455
00:37:17,018 --> 00:37:21,098
No, you got it backwards. Everything
adds up to nothing, that's the point.

456
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:24,355
- What's the point?
- Exactly. What's the point of anything?

457
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,777
You've got a case of the
zero theorem heebie-jeebies.

458
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,653
Don't you think working
sucked the soul out of me?

459
00:37:30,657 --> 00:37:34,452
Bet your big bald buns, it did.
I was nowhere near where you are.

460
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:38,328
You're knocking on the door, Quinn.
No wonder you're stressed.

461
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:40,124
Sit down.

462
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,918
Sit down.

463
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:47,215
Do you really have no
idea what you're doing?

464
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:51,594
We don't care. All we
care about is our call.

465
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:55,174
Could you inform Management we
want our call and we want it now?

466
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:57,885
Yes, yes, yes, God, talk
about tunnel vision.

467
00:37:57,893 --> 00:38:00,812
You'll get your call.
You're a bundle of nerves.

468
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:03,140
You can't work like this.

469
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:07,945
You're not gonna get that call of
yours all wound up tight like this.

470
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:12,740
I've got a friend who
might be able to help.

471
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:18,539
- You said you didn't have any friends.
- Ouch, Quinn, ouch. That hurts.

472
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:21,453
It's Qohen.

473
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:24,377
Q, no U, O-H-E-N.

474
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:27,422
All right. No need to
spell it out, man.

475
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:29,124
I've got the picture.

476
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,377
Let Joby handle it.

477
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:51,025
- Yes?
- Mr. Leth?

478
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,106
Qohen Leth?

479
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,582
Surprise.

480
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,709
Bainsley.

481
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,089
I waited.

482
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:16,342
You never called.

483
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:23,519
Oh, you poor thing.

484
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,815
Joby's right, you need me.

485
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:31,186
You're Mr. Joby's friend?

486
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:34,898
Well, Joby doesn't
have any friends.

487
00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:38,447
I feel so, so holy,

488
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,914
going to the chapel of love.

489
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,243
We prefer not to be touched.

490
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,830
The rent must be outrageous.

491
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,712
Actually, we own the building.

492
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:56,295
We bought it from an insurance
company some years ago.

493
00:39:56,303 --> 00:39:59,052
There'd been extensive fire damage.

494
00:40:00,557 --> 00:40:03,931
The previous occupants were
an order of monastic monks

495
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:08,891
who've sworn vows of chastity...

496
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:13,527
poverty and silence.

497
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:17,281
Apparently, no one broke
the silence to yell fire.

498
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:21,778
And what do we have here?

499
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,039
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

500
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,742
Goodness me.

501
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,545
What other surprises
do you have for me?

502
00:40:31,504 --> 00:40:33,130
That was a gift from...

503
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,506
Shh.

504
00:40:36,676 --> 00:40:37,968
You have...

505
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:45,723
the most intriguing bone structure.

506
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:47,395
So polished.

507
00:40:47,729 --> 00:40:51,274
So, so pure.

508
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:54,606
Ahh. So pure.

509
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,076
Hey, a mighty big hard
drive you got here.

510
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,700
What work do you do exactly?

511
00:41:04,704 --> 00:41:07,498
Well, I shoot trouble.

512
00:41:07,707 --> 00:41:09,580
Mr. Joby seemed to think

513
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:12,412
- that you might help us get our call?
- Yeah.

514
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,669
Yeah, he mentioned the call thing.

515
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:18,710
You're staring at me.

516
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:21,717
- We're terribly sorry.
- Ahh!

517
00:41:24,557 --> 00:41:27,260
I just broke a nail.

518
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:32,103
- On your big, fat, stupid keyboard.
- We'll get our first aid kit.

519
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:37,403
- Would you please just kiss it.
- Excuse us?

520
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:41,450
Whenever I hurt myself,
my daddy would kiss it

521
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,235
and make it all better.

522
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:47,497
- Well, we fail to see how...
- Please.

523
00:41:58,091 --> 00:41:59,668
You call that a kiss?

524
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:13,973
There.

525
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:16,313
All better?

526
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:17,818
Excuse me,

527
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:20,863
couldn't help noticing this young
lady's pathological attempts

528
00:42:20,864 --> 00:42:24,568
to project upon you her unresolved
issues of paternal abandonment.

529
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:28,030
Given the significant age difference
between the two of you...

530
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:30,114
Nosy bitch.

531
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:33,543
My daddy didn't abandon me.

532
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:35,878
He died.

533
00:42:37,297 --> 00:42:39,545
In case you're getting
the wrong idea,

534
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:42,717
I should tell you that I
don't do sexual intercourse.

535
00:42:42,718 --> 00:42:46,093
I don't care if a guy wraps
himself up like a latex mummy.

536
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:50,642
- But...
- But nothing is going inside me.

537
00:42:50,643 --> 00:42:52,936
Way too dangerous.

538
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:58,985
I'm into tantric,
bio-telemetric interfacing now.

539
00:42:59,068 --> 00:43:01,441
It's smart and safe.

540
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:07,779
And, God, it just
feel so super tingly.

541
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:10,451
Got anything to eat around here?

542
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:13,329
I'm starving my ass off.

543
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:18,872
Ah. What a mess.

544
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:25,928
- You're staring at me again.
- Forgive us.

545
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:27,381
Well, I don't mind.

546
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:30,137
Just noticing, that's all.

547
00:43:30,517 --> 00:43:33,391
You're a pretty intense guy.

548
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:38,145
So here you are, Qohen,

549
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:43,946
locked up all alone
and waiting for...

550
00:43:43,947 --> 00:43:47,276
For what? For a phone call?

551
00:43:47,617 --> 00:43:50,445
So tell me, what's
that all about? Hmm?

552
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:54,123
No, we've grown weary
explaining ourselves.

553
00:43:55,416 --> 00:44:00,543
But how am I supposed to help
if you don't tell me? Hmm?

554
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:04,209
Please.

555
00:44:04,217 --> 00:44:06,090
Please.

556
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:16,103
So come on.

557
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:18,398
How did it all start?

558
00:44:21,901 --> 00:44:24,274
We're not quite certain.

559
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:33,246
We must confess that
for good or ill,

560
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:37,121
that we always wanted
to feel different,

561
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,001
unique.

562
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:44,631
Objective analysis, however, concluded
that we're as inconsequential

563
00:44:44,632 --> 00:44:46,254
as anyone else.

564
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:51,506
We are but one in many
single worker bee

565
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:53,181
in a vast swarm

566
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:58,354
subject to the same imperatives
as billions of others.

567
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:05,188
We dulled our discontent
in alcohol, drugs, sex.

568
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,733
And then it happened.

569
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,952
One night...

570
00:45:15,663 --> 00:45:18,957
oh, a long time ago,

571
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:22,037
we were awakened by
the phone ringing.

572
00:45:22,962 --> 00:45:24,379
We picked it up.

573
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,210
A voice on the other end said:

574
00:45:28,217 --> 00:45:30,886
"Qohen Leth."

575
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:36,308
But before we could respond,

576
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:39,728
we felt this great
yawning maul of power

577
00:45:39,729 --> 00:45:42,397
opening through the phone line.

578
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:47,650
We felt a sudden rush of joy unlike
anything we've ever felt before.

579
00:45:47,654 --> 00:45:51,529
Then we knew quite clearly that
we only had to answer "yes"

580
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:55,407
and the voice would tell us
the meaning of our life.

581
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:59,831
The voice would tell us
our special calling.

582
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:03,957
The voice would give
us a reason for being.

583
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,171
And then?

584
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:12,216
And then...

585
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,597
in our excitement,

586
00:46:14,847 --> 00:46:18,847
we dropped the receiver,
disconnecting ourselves.

587
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:26,984
You've been waiting for
a call-back ever since?

588
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:29,358
What other reason is there
to pick up the phone?

589
00:46:29,362 --> 00:46:32,030
Well, communication for one.

590
00:46:32,031 --> 00:46:33,983
It's mostly unnecessary.

591
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,194
But that's what we're doing now.

592
00:46:37,203 --> 00:46:39,747
In a manner of speaking.

593
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:47,039
So all this time, you've been
waiting for a mysterious voice

594
00:46:47,046 --> 00:46:50,250
to tell you what to
do with your life.

595
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:56,514
Wow. Probably just a
cold call anyway.

596
00:46:56,556 --> 00:47:01,011
If you hadn't dropped the phone,
you'd own a time share in Majorca.

597
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,267
Big deal. Heh.

598
00:47:10,278 --> 00:47:13,231
Do you really believe
everything you've just told me?

599
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,736
Yes.

600
00:47:16,993 --> 00:47:18,820
Okay.

601
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,077
Okay.

602
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:25,952
I can help you.

603
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,459
But don't go away.

604
00:47:29,464 --> 00:47:33,133
And I'll be back in a
tail shake, all right?

605
00:47:46,981 --> 00:47:49,275
- Bainsley?
- Bob, buzz me in.

606
00:47:50,276 --> 00:47:52,854
- Bob who?
- Bob, I have to take a wicked pee.

607
00:47:52,862 --> 00:47:55,030
Buzz me in, Scotty.

608
00:47:55,031 --> 00:47:56,448
Our name isn't Scotty.

609
00:47:56,449 --> 00:47:57,866
I know that, Bob.

610
00:47:57,867 --> 00:47:59,569
- Our name isn't Bob.
- Come on.

611
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,950
I'm doing the tinkle dance here.

612
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:15,759
Where's your bathroom?

613
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:18,428
Where's your bathroom?

614
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,097
It's here.

615
00:48:38,157 --> 00:48:39,404
How did you get in?

616
00:48:39,408 --> 00:48:41,656
Fucking magic.

617
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:44,205
Excuse my French.

618
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:49,498
Holy shit, man, I think I did some
renal damage holding it in that long.

619
00:48:49,502 --> 00:48:51,204
Slim got stuck in traffic.

620
00:48:51,212 --> 00:48:52,538
Chubs drove, Bob.

621
00:48:52,547 --> 00:48:54,715
Fast as I could.

622
00:49:01,013 --> 00:49:02,305
- Sign here.
- What?

623
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,008
A receipt of delivery.

624
00:49:04,016 --> 00:49:07,390
- We're delivering...
- Bob. Assigned to help you. Sign.

625
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,183
Brilliant. We'll pick him
up in exactly four hours.

626
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,143
- Don't lose him.
- Don't lose him.

627
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:18,314
I wouldn't mess with the
clones if I were you.

628
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:22,117
They look harmless, but they'd
just as soon flame you to death.

629
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:26,956
This is a... This is a
creepy place you got here.

630
00:49:27,456 --> 00:49:29,374
Are you okay?

631
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,452
Actually, we're dying.

632
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,880
For me to be with, I mean.
You're a scary looking guy, Bob.

633
00:49:34,881 --> 00:49:37,298
Would you please
stop calling us Bob?

634
00:49:37,299 --> 00:49:39,969
- What do you want me to call you?
- Mr. Leth.

635
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:44,174
Leth? No, no, it's too wormy.

636
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:47,760
Qohen, then. Q, no U, O-H-E-N.

637
00:49:47,768 --> 00:49:49,470
Gotta buy another vowel.

638
00:49:49,478 --> 00:49:51,771
- Q.
- Or Q.

639
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:53,565
Yeah, Q will do.

640
00:49:53,566 --> 00:49:55,268
Q is you.

641
00:49:55,276 --> 00:49:57,103
Happy now?

642
00:49:57,111 --> 00:49:58,358
Why are you here?

643
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,281
Old man assigned me to get
you up and running again.

644
00:50:01,282 --> 00:50:02,948
- The old man?
- The boss.

645
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:05,073
The Darth Vader of microprocessing.

646
00:50:05,077 --> 00:50:08,121
The guy I call Daddy Dearest,
also known as Management.

647
00:50:08,122 --> 00:50:10,871
- You're Management's son?
- The one and only.

648
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:15,295
Heir to his dark throne, stuck
working this summer job.

649
00:50:15,296 --> 00:50:17,713
Order us a pizza.
I missed breakfast

650
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,792
and this is gonna take a while.

651
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,844
- We have oatmeal if you chose...
- If I wanted to vomit.

652
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:26,265
Order the pie, double cheese.

653
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:33,389
Fuck. Fuck. How can
you work like this?

654
00:50:33,648 --> 00:50:36,727
Oh, it's fucking ridiculous.

655
00:50:39,445 --> 00:50:41,818
Fuck. Fuck.

656
00:50:42,031 --> 00:50:44,780
I can't stand people gawking at me.

657
00:50:44,784 --> 00:50:46,986
Dad, Dad.

658
00:50:47,203 --> 00:50:48,529
Bob's on the job.

659
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,992
That's better.

660
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,580
Who can work...? Who can work
with him looking over your shoulder?

661
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,083
We have nothing to hide.

662
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:04,007
The point is moot since we're
not working for him any longer.

663
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:07,215
Yeah, right, keep
telling yourself that.

664
00:51:08,015 --> 00:51:12,561
- What do you mean?
- The old man is not done with you yet.

665
00:51:12,853 --> 00:51:14,305
But we're done with him.

666
00:51:15,356 --> 00:51:18,400
Like those preceding
us, we have burnt out.

667
00:51:18,401 --> 00:51:20,603
- We have decided to quit.
- Smart move.

668
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:23,485
- Too bad you can't.
- What do you mean? Mr. Joby...

669
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:26,488
Joby will tell you whatever
the old man wants him to.

670
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:29,070
You're a tool. The old
man uses everybody.

671
00:51:29,078 --> 00:51:30,787
That yummy night nurse chick?

672
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:32,456
- Bainsley?
- Tool.

673
00:51:32,707 --> 00:51:34,284
No.

674
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:37,416
She promised to help us.
We are waiting for her.

675
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,965
Wait all you want. She's not
gonna be back. Your call girl,

676
00:51:40,966 --> 00:51:42,883
she was paid by the hour.

677
00:51:43,551 --> 00:51:45,753
We don't believe you.

678
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:50,762
So, what do you think?

679
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,429
This thing is years ahead
of the competition.

680
00:51:54,437 --> 00:51:56,560
It works on nerve
endings, of course,

681
00:51:56,564 --> 00:52:00,189
but it's also synced directly
to the brain synapses.

682
00:52:00,192 --> 00:52:03,020
And Joby said it was
one of your projects.

683
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:05,277
We can't imagine.

684
00:52:05,573 --> 00:52:10,119
We never thought of our project
actually having any purpose.

685
00:52:10,786 --> 00:52:15,617
Top secret. I'm the
cyberspace test pilot.

686
00:52:15,624 --> 00:52:18,202
But first, you have to
do something for me.

687
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:25,508
Voilà.

688
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,462
And one size fits all.

689
00:52:28,471 --> 00:52:30,765
- Isn't it dangerous?
- Oh.

690
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:34,511
Depends on your idea of danger.

691
00:52:37,646 --> 00:52:39,098
Just trust me.

692
00:52:39,106 --> 00:52:44,938
Suit up, plug in, and click
on my website at midnight.

693
00:52:51,744 --> 00:52:56,745
- You're going out like that?
- They can look, but they can't touch.

694
00:52:59,043 --> 00:53:01,416
And don't be late.

695
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:04,631
I can't wait.

696
00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:12,298
So here's the deal, Q, straight
from the old man himself.

697
00:53:12,306 --> 00:53:15,134
You go back to work on
this nasty Zippity-T...

698
00:53:15,142 --> 00:53:18,346
- We're no longer interested.
- And in return,

699
00:53:18,354 --> 00:53:20,431
I get you your call.

700
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:23,354
You? You will get us our call?

701
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:27,653
Yes, I will get you your call. You're
not the only genius around here.

702
00:53:27,654 --> 00:53:30,984
I'm downloading your Shrink-Rom
files even as we speak.

703
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:34,161
- Those sessions are private.
- Sure they are.

704
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:40,956
Pizza! Pizza!

705
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:45,544
Pizza.

706
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:47,504
Ooh.

707
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:51,302
Nice.

708
00:53:51,303 --> 00:53:53,722
That's nice.

709
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,639
Uh... Where do I put it?

710
00:53:58,227 --> 00:53:59,770
Hmm.

711
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,734
Not Just A Pizza.

712
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:08,737
So...

713
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:10,648
cash or charge?

714
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:14,360
Hey.

715
00:54:15,327 --> 00:54:17,120
Thank you.

716
00:54:22,168 --> 00:54:25,838
- What are you staring at?
- Uh, sorry. Shit. Nothing.

717
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:29,466
- Uh, um... Sorry.
- Oops. Heh-heh.

718
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:30,919
Wrong answer.

719
00:54:30,926 --> 00:54:32,423
Thank you.

720
00:54:35,764 --> 00:54:37,682
Hey.

721
00:54:40,186 --> 00:54:41,979
Thank you.

722
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,648
Aaah!

723
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,068
Holy shit.

724
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:52,529
Oh, I think I got this hormonal
paradigm shift going on right now.

725
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,240
Was she looking at me funny?

726
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:56,864
We've grown accustomed to
people looking at us funny.

727
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,867
Yeah, but you are funny looking.

728
00:54:58,871 --> 00:55:01,950
♪ Not Just A Pizza, yum, yum ♪ ♪

729
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:05,244
All right, I gotta run.

730
00:55:05,252 --> 00:55:07,204
You can have the rest.

731
00:55:07,796 --> 00:55:10,749
Our diet precludes pizza.

732
00:55:10,758 --> 00:55:13,176
All right, well, save it.

733
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:17,348
I'll study your files, be
back first thing tomorrow.

734
00:55:22,603 --> 00:55:25,145
- You're late.
- I'm right on time, Bob.

735
00:55:25,146 --> 00:55:28,191
No excuses. Don't let
this happen again.

736
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:30,690
I'll be back, Q, you can
trust me. Let's go.

737
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:32,146
Why would we trust you?

738
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:34,821
You trusted everybody else.
Might as well trust me.

739
00:55:34,822 --> 00:55:38,116
Lose the "we" thing. I can't
work with it. Too annoying.

740
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,867
Just ask the doc if
you don't believe me.

741
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:00,720

I made it just for you.

748
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:15,753
The hair.

749
00:57:15,758 --> 00:57:18,256
Something special

750
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,678
for a special guy. Heh, heh, heh.

751
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:24,383
We're not at all
sure it's quite us.

752
00:57:24,391 --> 00:57:26,685
Don't be silly.

753
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:28,929
We no longer drink.

754
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:31,560
But you can do anything
you want here.

755
00:57:31,565 --> 00:57:34,359
You can drink and never get drunk.

756
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,279
And you can eat and never get fat.

757
00:57:37,738 --> 00:57:43,286
Let's forget all about hammering
out dents in sheet metal. Hoo!

758
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:51,080
Mm.

759
00:57:54,755 --> 00:57:57,049
- Huh.
- Hm?

760
00:58:01,595 --> 00:58:03,342
Good?

761
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:05,057
Hm?

762
00:58:06,558 --> 00:58:08,931
Where is this place?

763
00:58:09,728 --> 00:58:11,180
All in your mind,

764
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,774
or my mind.

765
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:17,436
Mm.

766
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:20,151
Do you feel this?

767
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:22,448
But it's not real.

768
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:24,492
It's better than real.

769
00:58:24,493 --> 00:58:27,867
You're in your computer.
I'm in mine.

770
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:32,251
We're connected by memory
chips and fibre optics.

771
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:35,329
And we're safe here.

772
00:58:35,587 --> 00:58:37,789
Just trust me.

773
00:58:40,509 --> 00:58:43,428
And let's get this party started.

774
00:58:44,096 --> 00:58:46,264
Ah! Oh! Ha, ha, ha.

775
00:58:47,683 --> 00:58:49,430
Ooh!

776
00:58:59,528 --> 00:59:02,321
Hey, come on.

777
00:59:02,322 --> 00:59:04,866
Just come. Ha, ha, ha.

778
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:09,075
Hey. Go. Whoo!

779
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:10,660
Yah!

780
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:17,413
Here, here.

781
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:18,873
Yeah.

782
00:59:22,718 --> 00:59:24,465
Hey?

783
00:59:27,473 --> 00:59:29,175
Qohen?

784
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:31,184
Qohen?

785
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:29,701
Who knew?

786
01:00:31,578 --> 01:00:34,031
Can we die here?

787
01:00:34,122 --> 01:00:36,245
I don't think so.

788
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:40,921
I hope. You're not supposed to.

789
01:00:56,186 --> 01:01:01,691
Apparently, Management has assigned
his own son to get us our call.

790
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:06,612
We really think that he's far too young
to be entrusted with the responsibility

791
01:01:06,613 --> 01:01:10,443
- of such an extent that...
- Oh, don't be such a wuss, Q.

792
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:12,448
Bob's a genius.

793
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:14,529
Whiz kid, super brain.

794
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:17,248

that, shut up and listen.

How did you tamper with
our Shrink-Rom programme?

803
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:49,152
Oh, it's easy. She's a tool
too, in case you didn't notice.

804
01:01:49,448 --> 01:01:52,993
Anyway, how long have you been
talking like the Queen of England?

805
01:01:53,285 --> 01:01:57,115
- Longer than we can remember.
- Stop. Fuck off.

806
01:01:58,624 --> 01:02:01,168
A former therapist suggested
it as a way to...

807
01:02:01,169 --> 01:02:02,415
Yeah, yeah.

808
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:05,418
As a way to closer
relate to humankind.

809
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:08,216
Yeah, you keep it
up, I'm gonna hurl.

810
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,969
Dear old Dad says I can use
Mancom to get you your call,

811
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,720
as long as you keep
crunching, of course.

812
01:02:15,724 --> 01:02:17,972
He's all hot on you.

813
01:02:17,976 --> 01:02:20,811
We can't imagine why.

814
01:02:20,812 --> 01:02:23,185
I've been wondering about that too.

815
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:29,238
I figure there can only
really be one reason.

816
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,692
You're the one, Q.

817
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:38,372
You are the chosen one.

818
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:44,461
You're the one the oracle said
would someday come to us.

819
01:02:50,759 --> 01:02:55,214
No. My guess: The old man picked you
because you're such a work dog.

820
01:02:55,222 --> 01:02:57,516
The man says mush,
you hit the harness.

821
01:02:57,517 --> 01:03:00,390
You drag that sled till you drop.

822
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:05,061
You have any idea what the
zero theorem is all about?

823
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:08,436
Never seemed important.

824
01:03:08,443 --> 01:03:14,195
Okay. Here's the poop, the whole
poop, and nothing but the poop.

825
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:19,120
You're trying to prove that the
universe is all for nothing.

826
01:03:19,121 --> 01:03:22,951
All matter, all energy, all life,

827
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:26,537
it's just this one-time-only
Big Bang glitch.

828
01:03:27,129 --> 01:03:31,129
Expanding universe will
eventually contract

829
01:03:31,133 --> 01:03:34,212
into a super dense black hole.

830
01:03:34,636 --> 01:03:37,840
Gravitational forces will be
so strong that everything

831
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:40,890
will get squeezed into a
point of zero dimension,

832
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:42,594
and "poof" the centre disappears.

833
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:45,521
No space, no time, no life,
no afterlife, nothing.

834
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:48,521
- Nada, zilch, zip, zero.
- Stop.

835
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:51,899
How would anyone believe
such a horrible thing?

836
01:03:51,903 --> 01:03:54,697
What's so horrible? I believe it.

837
01:03:54,698 --> 01:03:57,071
Nothing's perfect.
Nothing lasts forever.

838
01:03:57,075 --> 01:04:00,244
It's nothing to worry about
if you really think about it.

839
01:04:00,245 --> 01:04:03,619
Your father should've assigned
the zero theorem project to you.

840
01:04:03,623 --> 01:04:07,453
Well, he's been trying to,
for as long as I can remember.

841
01:04:07,461 --> 01:04:10,880
- But I refused to work on Zip-T.
- Why?

842
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,879
Well, because I'm nobody's tool.

843
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:14,926
All right, that's your job.

844
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,764
Zero must equal 100 percent.

845
01:04:20,807 --> 01:04:24,352
Zero must equal 100 percent.

846
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:28,687

870
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:30,811
Just take us someplace else.

872

- Where?
- Wherever.

A place all your own.

874
01:06:37,903 --> 01:06:42,825
All you have to do is imagine it,
and the VR programme will do the rest.

875

Come on, take a chance.
I'm giving you the control.

876

Ah! Qohen, stop!
Just close your eyes!

884
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:46,554

- Qohen, stop!

Is that what's inside you?

what I got. I fixed it.

955
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,718
Check this out. Look
what I made. All right.

956
01:13:25,727 --> 01:13:28,601
Prototype, soul-searching device.

957
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:30,807
What do you want?

958
01:13:30,815 --> 01:13:33,859
He's a cranky bastard, ain't we?

959
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:37,439
Is this what I lost
weeks of sleep for?

960
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:40,571
Look, this call you're waiting for,

961
01:13:40,575 --> 01:13:43,403
it's a figment of your imagination.

962
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:45,454
There's no such thing.

963
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:47,783
Not by phone at least.
Ask your shrink.

964
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,037
Yeah.

965
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:51,870
Yo, yo, yo, doc, you there?

966
01:13:52,253 --> 01:13:54,706
Tell him there's no phone call.

967
01:13:56,257 --> 01:14:00,678
I'm authorising you to
tell him the truth.

968
01:14:03,431 --> 01:14:05,884
Come on, tell him he's delusional.

969
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:12,189
It's true, Qohen.

970
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:15,439
Your phone call's a delusion.
Sorry about that.

971
01:14:17,403 --> 01:14:22,609
I was programmed to leave your
peculiar pathology untreated.

972
01:14:23,034 --> 01:14:26,238
- All right. Thanks, babes. See you.
- But I didn't...

973
01:14:26,621 --> 01:14:28,869
The truth ain't pretty, Q.

974
01:14:28,873 --> 01:14:32,794
But like my old man says,
it'll set you free.

975
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,337
Your call ain't carried
by British telecom.

976
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:37,836
It's coming from your
soul, connect with it.

977
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:42,344
You know how everything
inside you releases energy.

978
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:47,597
This suit will pick up the data and
relay it back to Mancom's neural net.

979
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,019
How can you believe in the soul
if you believe in nothing?

980
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,769
It's called a paradox, Q.

981
01:14:54,148 --> 01:14:56,942
I'm young enough to believe
all kinds of things.

982
01:14:56,943 --> 01:14:59,237
Did you know...

983
01:15:00,571 --> 01:15:03,615
that more than 33 different
aboriginal tribes believe

984
01:15:03,616 --> 01:15:07,616
that the soul resides somewhere
in the lower digestive tract?

985
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:09,947
Absolutely true.

986
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:12,867
But here's the zinger.

987
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:17,505
None of these tribes have any
knowledge of each other's existence.

988
01:15:18,089 --> 01:15:20,048
- Coincidence?
- Hm?

989
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:21,967
Coincidence?

990
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:27,098
Where do you think all these
separate peoples got such an idea?

991
01:15:27,473 --> 01:15:28,724
Dysentery.

992
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:32,475
Aha. Q, you're getting
to be very funny lately.

993
01:15:32,478 --> 01:15:34,806
Listen up, if you have a soul,

994
01:15:34,814 --> 01:15:36,606
which I'm betting you do,

995
01:15:36,607 --> 01:15:38,605
this baby will locate it

996
01:15:38,609 --> 01:15:40,811
and connect you with it.

997
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:46,409
- Did you order pizza?
- Did you order pizza?

998
01:15:56,753 --> 01:15:58,876
Can I come in?

999
01:16:26,741 --> 01:16:28,158
It's Management's son.

1000
01:16:28,826 --> 01:16:31,404
You know Management, don't you?

1001
01:16:32,997 --> 01:16:34,574
I'm so sorry.

1002
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:40,955
Joby told me I could have the
VR suit if I played along.

1003
01:16:41,631 --> 01:16:43,629
And you just seemed just...

1004
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:47,003
Well, you were lonely.

1005
01:16:47,011 --> 01:16:48,804
You're wrong.

1006
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:52,009
We were always alone, never lonely.

1007
01:16:52,016 --> 01:16:54,264
Qohen, please.

1008
01:16:56,604 --> 01:16:59,774
Bainsley, Bob. Bob, Bainsley.

1009
01:17:01,901 --> 01:17:03,603
She won't be staying long.

1010
01:17:03,611 --> 01:17:04,983
- Hi.
- Hi.

1011
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:07,736
The Hawaiian tropics chick, eh?

1012
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,613
Marooned yourself with this guy?

1013
01:17:09,617 --> 01:17:14,698
Well, we expect technology
supplied the necessary enticement.

1014
01:17:14,705 --> 01:17:17,457
Yeah, she's like a 10.

1015
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:20,582
There's no way she'd want
an old guy, Q. No of fence.

1016
01:17:20,586 --> 01:17:22,921
- None taken.
- But I do want him.

1017
01:17:22,922 --> 01:17:26,376
I think, and I'm pretty sure.

1018
01:17:26,884 --> 01:17:29,337
- What for?
- Heh, heh.

1019
01:17:29,595 --> 01:17:32,844
- There's just something about him.
- Yeah, right.

1020
01:17:33,558 --> 01:17:35,931
Must be the preservatives.

1021
01:17:35,935 --> 01:17:38,763
Hey, don't laugh at me.

1022
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:41,641
Sorry.

1023
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:45,232
I know it doesn't make sense,

1024
01:17:45,903 --> 01:17:49,232
but I need you...
I need you to believe me.

1025
01:17:52,994 --> 01:17:55,697
You said you never
wanted to leave me.

1026
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:58,373
That wasn't us, that
was someone else.

1027
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:02,499
No, that was you, stripped
of all your fear.

1028
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:05,630
A cheap preferential trick.

1029
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:08,425
What are you really afraid of?

1030
01:18:09,886 --> 01:18:12,009
We accept your apology

1031
01:18:12,013 --> 01:18:15,055
and wish you well in all
your future endeavours.

1032
01:18:15,056 --> 01:18:18,227
Hoping that Management
will assign someone else

1033
01:18:18,228 --> 01:18:21,180
to serve as the object
of your affection.

1034
01:18:26,986 --> 01:18:28,608
Well...

1035
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:34,194
Everything I own is
in my van outside.

1036
01:18:34,201 --> 01:18:36,995
I don't know where I'm going,

1037
01:18:37,538 --> 01:18:39,786
but will you come with me?

1038
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:43,669
Jesus, Q, do it.

1039
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:47,965
We're afraid it is too late.

1040
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:52,716
It is time Bainsley was on her way.
We have work to do.

1041
01:18:55,932 --> 01:18:58,760
We'll go somewhere far away,

1042
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:02,145
to a special place,

1043
01:19:02,146 --> 01:19:04,189
on a tropical island.

1044
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,188
A real one.

1045
01:19:07,026 --> 01:19:09,228
Just come with me.

1046
01:19:11,572 --> 01:19:15,402
I know we connected
somehow, you know?

1047
01:19:15,409 --> 01:19:17,703
I know we did.

1048
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:21,073
And you need me.

1049
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:26,041
And I need to be needed so bad.

1050
01:19:30,007 --> 01:19:32,175
Just come with me.

1051
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:38,925
You know we can be
together for real.

1052
01:19:40,267 --> 01:19:42,811
Just run away with me.

1053
01:19:46,232 --> 01:19:48,480
No, we can't.

1054
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,529
Jesus Christ, Q, do you
have any heart at all?

1055
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:52,252
- Hey, hey, do you need a break?
- Yeah.

1056
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:55,922
We feel like a rat in a rat trap.

1057
01:20:55,926 --> 01:20:58,879
I've been ready to gnaw my
foot off since I got here.

1058
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:01,216
Let's get out of this tomb.

1059
01:21:01,807 --> 01:21:03,600
- Do you mean us?
- Yeah.

1060
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:06,099
- You and...
- Me and yous.

1061
01:21:06,103 --> 01:21:09,432
Come on. Whatever happened
to giving up that "we" shit?

1062
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:13,019
Well, we've been trying.

1063
01:21:13,027 --> 01:21:16,696
Yeah, sure you have. Come on.
Let's go. Up. Come on.

1064
01:21:16,697 --> 01:21:19,821
We haven't been outside
in over a year.

1065
01:21:19,825 --> 01:21:22,153
What happened to you, man?

1066
01:21:24,371 --> 01:21:25,914
Life happened to me.

1067
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:28,457
Look, life happens to
everybody, all right?

1068
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:31,378
Try thinking about somebody
besides your own selves.

1069
01:21:31,379 --> 01:21:33,706
I'm tired. I'm stressed.

1070
01:21:33,714 --> 01:21:37,088
And I'm traumatised for the
rest of my poor love life

1071
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:41,093
with the way you dissed that
Bainsley, who is a scabillion times

1072
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:43,391
the woman that you deserve, so...

1073
01:21:44,225 --> 01:21:46,928
I need a break, Q,
all right? So get your...

1074
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:50,060
Get your fucking head out
of your ass and follow me.

1075
01:21:51,649 --> 01:21:55,103
- There we are.
- Come on. Come on, let's go.

1076
01:21:57,613 --> 01:22:00,487
- Penny for the guy?
- No, go. Go.

1077
01:22:00,491 --> 01:22:01,943
Come on. Come on, then.

1078
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:06,657
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

1079
01:22:06,664 --> 01:22:10,414
Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1080
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:12,494
You don't need...

1081
01:22:12,503 --> 01:22:15,001
You don't need skin cancer.

1082
01:22:15,005 --> 01:22:17,378
Right, there you go.
This is a big day.

1083
01:22:17,383 --> 01:22:19,585
A big day. We're going to the park.

1084
01:22:19,593 --> 01:22:22,762
And I got this new song
too, just for you.

1085
01:22:22,763 --> 01:22:24,510
Let's go.

1086
01:22:26,142 --> 01:22:27,468
Good morning.

1087
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:30,600
- You having fun?
- Excuse us?

1088
01:22:30,604 --> 01:22:32,602
Are you having a good time?

1089
01:22:32,606 --> 01:22:34,604
Approximately.

1090
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:38,358
Your dreams are our dreams.
That's why we say:

1091
01:22:38,362 --> 01:22:41,987
"Enough is never
enough." Call us today.

1092
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:44,032
Jeez. What are you doing?

1093
01:22:44,033 --> 01:22:45,656
- Get out of my way.
- Punks!

1094
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:48,364
Fuck you. I know,
I know, I'm fucking...

1095
01:22:48,372 --> 01:22:50,825
reaches out to that special you.

1096
01:22:55,087 --> 01:22:57,415
They'll never get it up.

1097
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:04,176
A little tail would make that thing
more aerodynamically active.

1098
01:23:06,599 --> 01:23:10,643
Ready? One, two, three.

1099
01:23:10,644 --> 01:23:12,721
You ever have a girlfriend?

1100
01:23:14,481 --> 01:23:17,981
Yeah, we had a girlfriend
when we were your age.

1101
01:23:17,985 --> 01:23:21,029
We spent every possible
moment with our long walks,

1102
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:24,575
movies, lying in the backyard
staring up at the stars

1103
01:23:24,576 --> 01:23:28,405
until her parents called
her in, sent us home.

1104
01:23:28,412 --> 01:23:31,661
Very much in love with
her, as we recall.

1105
01:23:31,665 --> 01:23:33,412
What ever happened to her?

1106
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:38,001
We married her, she
eventually divorced us

1107
01:23:38,005 --> 01:23:40,253
and we never saw her again.

1108
01:23:40,257 --> 01:23:42,926
Thanks for that happy,
hopeful little parable.

1109
01:23:42,927 --> 01:23:46,927
I can hardly wait for my
own first divorce. Heh.

1110
01:23:47,598 --> 01:23:51,848
- Yeah, more, more. That's it, yeah.
- I don't know any girls my age.

1111
01:23:52,603 --> 01:23:55,520
Seems like getting old
would be pretty boring.

1112
01:23:55,521 --> 01:23:59,441
Old people, they just... They do the
same thing day after day after day.

1113
01:23:59,442 --> 01:24:03,068
Like listening to the same
song over and over and over.

1114
01:24:03,072 --> 01:24:04,990
Yeah, maybe it's a good song.

1115
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:08,069
Maybe. After a while, it gets old.

1116
01:24:08,077 --> 01:24:11,622
- Ah!
- Get out of here. Go.

1117
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,202
You know, I'm 15.

1118
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:19,960
I'm 15 and already tons of
stuff bores me to death.

1119
01:24:20,381 --> 01:24:23,425
Think about what will happen
when I get as old as you.

1120
01:24:28,138 --> 01:24:30,056
I'm about to crash.

1121
01:24:30,057 --> 01:24:31,679
I need some food.

1122
01:24:31,684 --> 01:24:33,851
Do us a couple of dogs, Q?

1123
01:24:33,852 --> 01:24:37,147
A couple of wieners for
a couple of weenies.

1124
01:24:38,148 --> 01:24:42,319
- Can we have some relish on ours?
- Of course. You got it.

1125
01:24:43,153 --> 01:24:46,527
You know, I just met her,
but I really miss Bainsley.

1126
01:24:46,532 --> 01:24:49,235
Must be killing you,
losing a doll like that.

1127
01:24:49,243 --> 01:24:51,696
Sorry, man. I'm going.

1128
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,998
Just come with me.

1129
01:25:03,549 --> 01:25:05,251
We connected.

1130
01:25:06,051 --> 01:25:08,174
You need me.

1131
01:25:09,013 --> 01:25:12,012
And I need to be needed so bad.

1132
01:25:22,735 --> 01:25:26,904
What's the matter? Just realising what
a jerk you were dumping Bainsley?

1133
01:25:26,905 --> 01:25:29,574
I'm just thinking...

1134
01:25:29,575 --> 01:25:32,028
Did I just hear what
I think I heard?

1135
01:25:33,579 --> 01:25:37,659
I told you. I've
been working on it.

1136
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:40,870
That's what I like about you, man.

1137
01:25:40,919 --> 01:25:44,547
You're not too old a dog
to learn new tricks.

1138
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:58,183
- What's wrong?
- I'm just dizzy. I'm dizzy.

1139
01:25:58,187 --> 01:26:00,310
Just a little dizzy.

1140
01:26:03,275 --> 01:26:04,522
You're burning up.

1141
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:06,979
Happens when I don't sleep.
Not a big deal.

1142
01:26:06,987 --> 01:26:10,111
- You need medical attention.
- Just get me aspirin

1143
01:26:10,115 --> 01:26:11,988
and run me a cool bath.

1144
01:26:16,789 --> 01:26:19,538
I feel better already.

1145
01:26:21,251 --> 01:26:23,954
I just need some sleep.

1146
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,058
Bob?

1147
01:26:37,142 --> 01:26:38,844
Bob?

1148
01:28:09,485 --> 01:28:11,028
Unh!

1149
01:28:45,145 --> 01:28:48,064
I... No.

1150
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:50,734
I don't wanna take...

1151
01:28:51,485 --> 01:28:54,404
I knew nothing.

1152
01:29:09,419 --> 01:29:11,212
Ow.

1153
01:29:22,057 --> 01:29:23,554
Unh!

1154
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:33,317
You have made a very big mistake.

1155
01:29:33,318 --> 01:29:35,612
- He just needs some rest.
- Yeah.

1156
01:29:37,364 --> 01:29:38,861
Come on.

1157
01:29:40,784 --> 01:29:44,409
- I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.
- Here we go.

1158
01:29:45,455 --> 01:29:47,953
We'll be back tomorrow
for the hardware.

1159
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:49,956
Don't touch anything.

1160
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:52,959
We have notified your supervisor.

1161
01:30:32,919 --> 01:30:34,211
Quinn, you bastard.

1162
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:39,668
I just called by

1163
01:30:39,676 --> 01:30:43,301
to say thank you for getting
me fired from my job.

1164
01:30:44,306 --> 01:30:46,179
You're still a tool.

1165
01:30:46,683 --> 01:30:49,557
At least I'm not playing
patty-cake in a bathtub

1166
01:30:49,561 --> 01:30:52,146
with a teenage boy, you sick freak.

1167
01:30:52,147 --> 01:30:54,145
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

1168
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:55,942
I know what I know.

1169
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:00,314
I had a good job till you came
along and you fucked it up

1170
01:31:00,322 --> 01:31:03,651
and you fucked up Zip-T and
you fucked up poor old Bob.

1171
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:07,113
Well, I'm here to say fuck you
and the entity around it all.

1172
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,995
That's F-U-Q-U, Quinn!

1173
01:31:11,792 --> 01:31:15,212
- You know my name.
- I know who you are.

1174
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:18,332
Leth!

1175
01:31:19,508 --> 01:31:21,335
Do you?

1176
01:32:18,734 --> 01:32:20,356
Unh!

1177
01:32:38,795 --> 01:32:41,748
I'm afraid you won't find
my son here, Mr. Leth.

1178
01:32:42,466 --> 01:32:44,919
He's been hospitalised.

1179
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,343
Is he all right?

1180
01:32:48,346 --> 01:32:51,470
If I believed in miracles,
I'd be praying for one now.

1181
01:32:52,017 --> 01:32:53,639
He's not well.

1182
01:32:53,643 --> 01:32:56,687
My son's never been well.

1183
01:32:56,813 --> 01:33:00,267
I've tried to protect him, but
he's always chafed at my touch.

1184
01:33:00,567 --> 01:33:04,192
This morning, he stole a car
from my vintage collection.

1185
01:33:04,196 --> 01:33:06,819
Are you real or are
you just in my mind?

1186
01:33:06,823 --> 01:33:10,402
It doesn't matter at all. You're
part of the neural net now.

1187
01:33:12,329 --> 01:33:14,998
- So there's no answer?
- Depends on the question.

1188
01:33:14,999 --> 01:33:16,370
What I'm living for?

1189
01:33:16,374 --> 01:33:20,418
That's a good question, Mr. Leth,
posed to the entirely wrong person.

1190
01:33:20,419 --> 01:33:23,838
You seem to have mistaken me for
a considerably higher power.

1191
01:33:23,839 --> 01:33:27,260
I'm not the source of your call.
I'm not God or the devil.

1192
01:33:27,261 --> 01:33:30,304
I'm just a man seeking the truth.

1193
01:33:30,305 --> 01:33:34,009
- What truth if...?
- Turn around and look.

1194
01:33:34,267 --> 01:33:35,810
That's it.

1195
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:38,642
Chaos encapsulated.

1196
01:33:39,856 --> 01:33:42,184
That's all there is at the end,

1197
01:33:42,192 --> 01:33:45,271
just as it was at the beginning.

1198
01:33:45,278 --> 01:33:48,197
There it is then. You've
proved the zero theorem.

1199
01:33:48,198 --> 01:33:52,323
Not quite. Mancom is still, as
you said, crunching the data.

1200
01:33:52,327 --> 01:33:56,907
Why would you want to prove
that all is for nothing?

1201
01:33:56,915 --> 01:34:00,585
I never said all is for nothing.
I'm a businessman, Mr. Leth.

1202
01:34:00,586 --> 01:34:02,458
Nothing is for nothing.

1203
01:34:04,381 --> 01:34:08,131
- What?
- There's money in ordering disorder.

1204
01:34:08,134 --> 01:34:12,384
Chaos pays, Mr. Leth. Chaos
comprises a rich vein of ore

1205
01:34:12,389 --> 01:34:15,638
that with Mancom's
muscle, will be all mine

1206
01:34:15,642 --> 01:34:17,142
to mine.

1207
01:34:17,143 --> 01:34:21,393
The saddest aspect of mankind's
need to believe in a God,

1208
01:34:21,398 --> 01:34:24,977
or to put it another way,
a purpose greater than this life,

1209
01:34:24,985 --> 01:34:27,563
is that it makes this
life meaningless.

1210
01:34:27,571 --> 01:34:31,821
You see, this is all just a way station
on the road to promised eternity.

1211
01:34:31,825 --> 01:34:33,698
The reason I chose you...

1212
01:34:33,702 --> 01:34:35,950
I mean, rather perversely, I admit,

1213
01:34:35,954 --> 01:34:40,375
is because you represent the
antithesis of my project.

1214
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:41,872
A man of faith.

1215
01:34:41,877 --> 01:34:45,170
You see, you've persisted in
believing that a phone call

1216
01:34:45,171 --> 01:34:48,750
could give your life meaning.
You've waited and waited,

1217
01:34:48,758 --> 01:34:52,758
and as a result, you've
led a meaningless life.

1218
01:34:53,847 --> 01:34:57,927
I'm sorry, but I no longer
require your services.

1219
01:34:59,394 --> 01:35:03,269
You pervert! You devil!

1220
01:35:03,273 --> 01:35:04,645
You monster!

1221
01:35:04,649 --> 01:35:07,022
You tear me up, charge me interest.

1222
01:35:07,027 --> 01:35:10,857
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1223
01:35:11,281 --> 01:35:14,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1224
01:35:14,367 --> 01:35:17,786
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1225
01:35:17,787 --> 01:35:21,749
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1226
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:25,168
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1227
01:35:25,169 --> 01:35:28,797
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1228
01:35:28,798 --> 01:35:31,968
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1229
01:35:31,969 --> 01:35:36,844
Mancom, making sense of
the good things in life.

1230
01:35:37,307 --> 01:35:41,478
Mancom, making sense of
the good things in life.

1231
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:46,395
Mancom, making sense of
the good things in life.

1232
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:51,355
Mancom, making sense of
the good things in life.

1233
01:35:51,363 --> 01:35:54,487
Mancom, making good
things of man life.

1234
01:35:54,491 --> 01:35:56,909
Man things in good...

1235
01:35:58,662 --> 01:36:00,660
Making good things...

1236
01:36:00,664 --> 01:36:02,206
Making...

1237
01:36:02,207 --> 01:36:05,707
Making man life... Making
man life... Making man life...

1238
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:08,834
Making man life... Making
man life... Making man life...

1239
01:36:22,644 --> 01:36:24,144
Oh.

1240
01:36:24,145 --> 01:36:27,269
