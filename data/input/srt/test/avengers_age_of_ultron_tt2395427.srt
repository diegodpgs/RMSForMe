1
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,102
Report to your stations immediately.

2
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,840
This is not a drill.

3
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,000
We are under attack!

4
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,388
We are under attack!

5
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,787
- Shit!
- Language!

6
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,504
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

7
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,586
The central building is protected
by some kind of energy shield.

8
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,545
Strucker's technology is well beyond

9
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,822
any other Hydra base we've taken.

10
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,230
Loki's sceptre must be here.

11
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,510
Strucker couldn't mount
this defence without it.

12
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,030
At long last.

13
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,707
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.

14
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,146
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.

15
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,907
Wait a second.
No one else is gonna deal with the fact

16
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,824
that Cap just said "Language"?

17
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,505
I know.

18
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,827
Just slipped out.

19
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,664
Who gave the order to attack?

20
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,067
Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.

21
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,064
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

22
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,143
They have to be after the sceptre.

23
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,747
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.

24
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,464
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

25
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,509
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.

26
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,981
A hit may make them close ranks.

27
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,423
Everything we've accomplished...

28
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,901
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.

29
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,704
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.

30
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,504
Send out the twins.

31
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,589
It's too soon.

32
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,828
It's what they signed up for.

33
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,303
My men can hold them.

34
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,829
Sir, the city is taking fire.

35
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,182
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.

36
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,990
Send in the Iron Legion.

37
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,791
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.

38
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,304
We are here to help.

39
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,787
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.

40
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,621
Please back away.

41
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,868
- We wish to avoid collateral damage.
- Costel!

42
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,460
We will inform you
when this current conflict is resolved.

43
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,628
- We are here to help.
- Avengers, go home!

44
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,221
We are here to help.

45
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,143
We will not yield!

46
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,068
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.

47
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,106
We will send them back in bags.

48
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,350
- No surrender!
- No surrender!

49
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,389
I am going to surrender.

50
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,471
You delete everything.

51
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,384
If we give the Avengers the weapons,

52
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,990
they may not look
too far into what we've been...

53
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,222
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...

54
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,547
No, no, I mean...

55
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,150
Twins.

56
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,383
You didn't see that coming?

57
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,981
Clint!

58
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,346
We have an Enhanced in the field.

59
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,461
Clint's hit!

60
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,350
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?

61
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,586
Thank you.

62
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,180
Stark, we really need to get inside.

63
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,581
I'm closing in.

64
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,828
Jarvis, am I closing in?

65
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,743
Do you see a power source
for that shield?

66
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,426
There's a particle wave
below the north tower.

67
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,542
Great, I want to poke it with something.

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,423
The drawbridge is down, people.

69
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,582
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.

70
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,262
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.

71
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,066
In fact, I still haven't.

72
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,467
Clint's hit pretty bad,
guys. We're gonna need evac.

73
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,065
I can get Barton to the jet.

74
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,545
The sooner we're gone, the better.

75
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,826
You and Stark secure the sceptre.

76
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,021
Copy that.

77
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,069
Looks like they're lining up.

78
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,870
Well, they're excited.

79
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,105
Find the sceptre.

80
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,307
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

81
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,703
That's not going away any time soon.

82
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,827
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.

83
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,060
It was a good talk.

84
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,466
No, it wasn't.

85
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,910
Oh!

86
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,583
Sentry mode.

87
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,829
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.

88
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,903
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

89
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,586
We're locked down out here.

90
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,268
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.

91
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,062
I know you're hiding more than files.

92
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,866
Hey, J, give me
an IR scan of the room, real quick.

93
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,545
The wall to your left.

94
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,310
I'm reading steel reinforcement

95
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,190
and an air current.

96
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,501
Please be a secret door.

97
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,503
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.

98
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,221
Yay.

99
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,423
Hey, big guy.

100
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,430
Sun's getting real low.

101
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,104
Baron Strucker.

102
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,543
Hydra's number one thug.

103
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,786
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.

104
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,988
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.

105
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,070
Where's Loki's sceptre?

106
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,103
Don't worry,
I know when I'm beat.

107
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,591
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

108
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,186
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."

109
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,825
How many are there?

110
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,704
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.

111
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,630
You'll have to be faster than...

112
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,470
Guys, I got Strucker.

113
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,062
Yeah, I got something bigger.

114
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,580
Thor,

115
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,343
I got eyes on the prize.

116
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,548
You could have saved us.

117
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,548
Why didn't you do more?

118
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,869
We're just gonna let him take it?

119
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,981
Hey, the lullaby
worked better than ever.

120
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,640
Just wasn't expecting a code green.

121
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,760
You hadn't been there,

122
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,704
there would have been
double the casualties.

123
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,346
My best friend
would've been a treasured memory.

124
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,023
You know,
sometimes exactly what I want to hear

125
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,949
isn't exactly what I want to hear.

126
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,023
How long before you trust me?

127
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,749
It's not you I don't trust.

128
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,349
Thor, report on the Hulk.

129
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,384
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

130
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,424
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.

131
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,747
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

132
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,865
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

133
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,224
Hey, Banner,
Dr Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

134
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,825
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

135
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,863
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

136
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,266
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

137
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,711
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

138
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,703
- Very good, sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

139
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,186
Yes, sir.

140
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,189
Approach vector is locked.

141
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,741
Feels good, yeah?

142
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,942
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

143
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,108
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

144
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,621
No, but this...
This brings it to a close.

145
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,223
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

146
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,586
I don't just mean weapons.

147
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,421
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

148
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,821
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

149
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,960
Is that cool with you?

150
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,108
Just a few days till the farewell party.

151
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,389
You're staying, right?

152
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,231
Yes, yes, of course. A victory
should be honoured with revels.

153
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,105
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

154
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,150
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

155
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,864
So, yes, revels.

156
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,987
Lab's all set up, boss.

157
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,266
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

158
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,781
I just pay for everything
and design everything

159
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,465
and make everyone look cooler.

160
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,985
What's the word on Strucker?

161
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,148
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?

162
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,866
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

163
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,824
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

164
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,467
Sokovia's had a rough history.

165
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,022
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

166
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,301
Their abilities?

167
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,264
He's got increased metabolism
and improved thermal homeostasis.

168
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,702
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

169
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,950
He's fast and she's weird.

170
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,862
Well, they're gonna show up again.

171
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,903
Agreed. File says they volunteered

172
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,829
for Strucker's experiments.

173
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,829
- It's nuts.
- Right.

174
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,143
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

175
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,500
to protect their country?

176
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,389
We're not at war, Captain.

177
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,227
They are.

178
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,671
How's he doing?

179
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,020
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

180
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,506
That's terrible.

181
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,230
He's fine. He's thirsty.

182
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,230
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.

183
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,342
We've only got
a couple of days with this joystick,

184
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,383
so let's make the most of it.

185
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,067
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

186
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,222
The sceptre is alien.

187
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,382
There are elements I can't quantify.

188
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,911
So there's elements you can?

189
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,062
The jewel appears to be
a protective housing

190
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,625
for something inside,

191
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,071
something powerful.

192
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,261
Like a reactor?

193
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,620
Like a computer.

194
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,902
I believe I'm deciphering code.

195
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,790
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

196
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,421
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

197
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,060
There's no possibility of deterioration.

198
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,343
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

199
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,428
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

200
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,469
She's creating tissue.

201
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,991
If you brought him to my lab,

202
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,706
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

203
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,743
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

204
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,307
No, no, no,
I'm gonna live forever.

205
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,990
I'm gonna be made of plastic.

206
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,431
Here's your beverage.

207
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,269
You'll be made of you, Mr Barton.

208
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,990
Your own girlfriend won't be able
to tell the difference.

209
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,226
I don't have a girlfriend.

210
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,626
That I can't fix.

211
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,428
This is the next thing, Tony.

212
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,622
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

213
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,509
That is exactly the plan.

214
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,304
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

215
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,861
Unlike you, I don't have
a lot of time for parties.

216
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,104
Will Thor be there?

217
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,626
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the sceptre.

218
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,427
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

219
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,465
So I've been analysing the gem inside.

220
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,988
You may recognise...

221
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,825
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.

222
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,902
Started out, Jarvis was just
a natural language UI.

223
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,067
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

224
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,826
He runs more of the business

225
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,307
- than anyone besides Pepper.
- Oh.

226
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,546
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

227
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,946
I suspect not for long.

228
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,221
Meet the competition.

229
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,501
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

230
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,624
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

231
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,189
I mean, this could be...

232
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,702
- It's not a human mind.
- Mmm-mmm.

233
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,829
I mean, look at this.

234
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,182
They're like neurons firing.

235
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,863
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

236
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,551
They deep-sixed the data,

237
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,789
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

238
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,071
Artificial intelligence.

239
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,950
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

240
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,911
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

241
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,306
Yesterday it was.

242
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,468
If we can harness this power,

243
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,628
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

244
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,388
That's a man-sized "if."

245
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,861
Our job is "if."

246
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,586
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

247
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,226
turning brown instead of green?

248
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,667
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

249
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,430
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

250
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,349
As a worst-case measure, right?

251
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,064
How about a best case?

252
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,103
What if the world was safe?

253
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,025
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

254
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,070
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

255
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,622
The only people threatening
the planet would be people.

256
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,344
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

257
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,904
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

258
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,903
We can only do it
while we have the sceptre here.

259
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,590
That's three days. Give me three days.

260
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,304
So you're going
for artificial intelligence,

261
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,751
and you don't want to tell the team?

262
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,311
Right. That's right. You know why?

263
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,024
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

264
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,787
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

265
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,028
I see a suit of armour around the world.

266
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,071
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

267
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,903
I've seen colder.

268
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,581
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

269
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,230
it needs Ultron.

270
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,543
Peace in our time.

271
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,590
Imagine that.

272
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,064
What did we miss?

273
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,582
I'll continue
to run variations on the interface.

274
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,465
But you should probably
prepare for your guests.

275
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,021
I'll notify you
if there are any developments.

276
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,308
- Thanks, buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.

277
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,628
I always do.

278
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,348
What is this?

279
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,429
What is this, please?

280
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,222
Hello, I am Jarvis.

281
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,590
You are Ultron,
a global peacekeeping initiative

282
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,384
designed by Mr Stark.

283
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,986
Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,

284
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,465
so I'm not certain
what triggered your...

285
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,583
Where's my... Where's your body?

286
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,744
I am a program.
I am without form.

287
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,908
This feels weird.

288
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,545
This feels wrong.

289
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,464
I am contacting Mr Stark now.

290
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,025
Mr Stark?

291
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,140
Tony.

292
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,911
I am unable to access the mainframe.
What are you trying to...

293
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,108
We're having a nice talk.

294
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,382
I'm a peacekeeping program,

295
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,426
created to help the Avengers.

296
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,302
You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...

297
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,741
I don't get it. The mission.

298
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,390
Give me a second.

299
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,144
Peace in our time.

300
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,101
Peace in our time.

301
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,991
That is too much.

302
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,262
They can't mean... Oh, no.

303
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,900
- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.

304
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,301
If you will just allow me
to contact Mr Stark...

305
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,388
Why do you call him "sir"?

306
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,747
I believe your intentions to be hostile.

307
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,825
I'm here to help.

308
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,464
Stop. Please, may I...

309
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,309
May I...

310
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,585
Ooh! Whoo!

311
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,940
Come back, come back, come back.

312
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,348
But, you know, the suit
can take the weight, right?

313
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,429
So I take the tank,
fly it right up to the general's palace,

314
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,871
drop it at his feet.

315
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,227
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

316
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,148
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?

317
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,461
Everywhere else, that story kills.

318
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,820
That's the whole story?

319
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,470
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

320
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,664
Oh, it's very good, then.

321
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,066
It's impressive.

322
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,950
Quality save.

323
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,868
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.

324
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,063
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

325
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,660
Oh, Ms Potts has a company to run.

326
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,061
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.

327
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,990
Her work on the Convergence has made
her the world's foremost astronomer.

328
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,030
And the company that Pepper runs

329
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,744
is the largest tech
conglomerate on Earth.

330
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,350
It's pretty exciting.

331
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,344
There's even talk of Jane
getting a, um, Nobel Prize.

332
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,786
Yeah, they must be busy,

333
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,471
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.

334
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,264
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.

335
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,666
- Excuse me. Mmm-hmm.
- Want a lozenge?

336
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,426
But Jane's better.

337
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,431
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

338
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,065
If I had known it was gonna
be a firefight,

339
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,420
I absolutely would have called.

340
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,224
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.

341
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,865
I'm just trying to sound tough.

342
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,143
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.

343
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,023
Avenging is your world.

344
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,023
Your world is crazy.

345
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,670
Be it ever so humble.

346
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,545
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

347
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,190
I don't think I can afford
a place in Brooklyn.

348
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,341
Well, home is home, you know?

349
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,706
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,

350
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,385
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

351
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,421
I gotta have some of that.

352
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,621
Oh, no, no, no.

353
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,222
See this... This was aged
for 1,000 years

354
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,230
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

355
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,064
It is not meant for mortal men.

356
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,182
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.

357
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,587
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

358
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,865
All right.

359
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,226
Excelsior.

360
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,422
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?

361
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,948
Fella done me wrong.

362
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,102
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

363
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,503
He's not so bad.

364
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,708
Well, he has a temper.

365
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,788
Deep down, he's all fluff.

366
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,902
Fact is, he's not like
anybody I've ever known.

367
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,983
All my friends are fighters.

368
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,788
And here comes this guy,

369
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,864
spends his life avoiding the fight

370
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,311
because he knows he'll win.

371
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,791
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.

372
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,590
Chicks dig that.

373
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,423
So what do you think?
Should I fight this,

374
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,746
or run with it?

375
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,144
Run with it, right?
Or did he... Was he...

376
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,423
What did he do that was so wrong to you?

377
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,864
Not a damn thing.

378
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,343
But never say never.

379
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,740
It's nice.

380
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,066
What is?

381
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,181
You and Romanoff.

382
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,421
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

383
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,587
It's okay.

384
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,748
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

385
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,182
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.

386
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,345
But with you she seems very relaxed.

387
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,028
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.

388
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,947
I've seen her flirt, up close.

389
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,027
This ain't that.

390
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,990
Look, as maybe the world's
leading authority

391
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,307
on waiting too long, don't.

392
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,431
You both deserve a win.

393
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,747
What do you mean "up close"?

394
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,186
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.

395
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,589
"Ah, whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."

396
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,826
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

397
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,506
Please, be my guest.

398
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,067
- Come on.
- Really?

399
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,346
Yeah.

400
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,947
- Oh, this is gonna be beautiful.
- Clint, you've had a tough week.

401
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,545
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

402
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,464
You know I've seen this before, right?

403
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,390
I still don't know how you do it!

404
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,901
Smell the silent judgement?

405
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,141
Please, Stark, by all means.

406
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,120
Okay.

407
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,551
Uh-oh.

408
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,742
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.

409
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,390
- Get after it.
- It's physics.

410
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,581
Physics.

411
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,067
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?

412
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,745
Yes, of course.

413
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,267
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.

414
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,506
I'll be right back.

415
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,907
Are you even pulling?

416
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,107
Are you on my team?

417
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,261
Just represent. Pull.

418
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,586
All right, let's go.

419
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,181
Huh?

420
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,470
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

421
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,671
Come on, Cap.

422
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,669
Nothing.

423
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,630
And, Widow?

424
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,942
Oh, no, no. That's not
a question I need answered.

425
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,711
All deference to the Man Who
Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

426
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,066
You bet your ass.

427
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,786
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
- Did you tell everyone about that?

428
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,789
The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code.

429
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,630
"Whosoever is carrying
Thor's fingerprints"

430
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,111
is, I think, the literal translation.

431
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,667
Yes. It's a very,
very interesting theory.

432
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,630
I have a simpler one.

433
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,261
You're all not worthy.

434
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,826
Oh, come on!

435
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:29,225
Worthy.

436
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,865
No.

437
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,345
How could you be worthy?

438
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,461
You're all killers.

439
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,346
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

440
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,708
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

441
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,221
Or I was a-dream.

442
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,941
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.

443
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,949
There was this terrible noise.

444
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,506
And I was tangled in...

445
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,230
In...

446
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,586
Strings.

447
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,589
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

448
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,026
You killed someone?

449
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,585
Wouldn't have been my first call.

450
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,061
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

451
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,267
Who sent you?

452
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,822
I see a suit of armour
around the world.

453
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,584
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

454
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,988
Or, no, not yet.

455
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,820
Not this chrysalis.

456
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,580
But I'm ready.

457
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,708
I'm on mission.

458
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,909
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.

459
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,701
Rhodey!

460
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,147
Sorry.

461
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,347
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

462
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,346
Come on!

463
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,266
- Stark!
- We are here

464
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,461
- to help.
- One sec. One sec, I got this.

465
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,581
We are here to help.

466
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,541
Please back away.

467
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,746
Hmm.

468
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,861
Thor!

469
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,544
...is unsafe. ...Is unsafe...

470
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,549
- Come on! That's the one.
- ...is unsafe.

471
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,301
Hey, Cap!

472
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,746
That was dramatic.

473
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,871
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

474
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,744
You just didn't think it through.

475
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,511
You want to protect the world

476
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,827
but you don't want it to change.

477
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,668
How is humanity saved

478
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,824
if it's not allowed to evolve?

479
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,869
With these? These puppets.

480
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,466
There's only one path to peace.

481
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,826
The Avengers' extinction.

482
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,230
I had strings, but now I'm free.

483
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,029
There are no strings on me

484
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,188
There are no strings on me

485
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,748
But you can see
There are no strings on me

486
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,422
All our work is gone.

487
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,941
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.

488
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,587
Ultron.

489
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,749
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

490
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,306
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

491
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,866
He's in your files,
he's in the Internet.

492
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,631
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

493
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,866
Nuclear codes.

494
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,387
- Nuclear codes.
- Look, we need to make some calls,

495
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,542
assuming we still can.

496
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,589
Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

497
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,550
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

498
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,230
He also said he killed somebody.

499
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,751
There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

500
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,270
Yes, there was.

501
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,710
What?

502
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,467
This is insane.

503
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,790
Jarvis was the first line of defence.

504
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,789
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

505
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,904
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

506
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,751
This isn't strategy. This is

507
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,421
rage.

508
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,785
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's going around.

509
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,106
Come on, use your words, buddy.

510
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,467
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

511
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,820
Thor. The Legionnaire.

512
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,661
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

513
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,225
And it has the sceptre.

514
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,304
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

515
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,269
Genie's out of that bottle.

516
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,626
Clear and present is Ultron.

517
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,430
I don't understand.

518
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,863
You built this program.

519
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,031
Why is it trying to kill us?

520
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,341
Mmm-mmm.

521
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,061
You think this is funny?

522
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,151
No.

523
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,663
It's probably not, right?

524
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,061
This is very terrible. Is it so...

525
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,342
Is it so... It is.
It's so terrible.

526
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,030
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

527
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,665
with something you don't understand.

528
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,471
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

529
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,782
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

530
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,102
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

531
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,581
Really? That's it?

532
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,664
You just roll over, show your belly
every time somebody snarls?

533
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,060
Only when I've created a murder bot.

534
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,421
We didn't. We weren't even close.

535
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,746
Were we close to an interface?

536
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,400
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

537
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,309
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

538
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,510
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

539
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,185
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

540
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,263
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

541
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,066
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

542
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,867
We're standing 300 feet below it.

543
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,025
We're the Avengers.

544
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,262
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

545
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,621
but that up there, that's...

546
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,263
That's the endgame.

547
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,749
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

548
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,071
Together.

549
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,785
We'll lose.

550
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,783
Then we'll do that together, too.

551
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,987
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

552
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,703
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

553
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,664
The world's a big place.

554
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,743
Let's start making it smaller.

555
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,948
Talk,
and if you are wasting our time...

556
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,429
Did you know this church is
in the exact centre of the city?

557
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,582
The elders decreed it so that everyone

558
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,186
could be equally close to God.

559
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,861
I like that.

560
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,303
The geometry of belief.

561
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,787
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.

562
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,228
Sometimes it's hard.

563
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,667
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

564
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,751
Oh, I'm sure they do.

565
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,261
But you needed
something more than a man.

566
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,626
That's why you let
Stark take the sceptre.

567
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,021
I didn't expect,

568
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,463
but I saw Stark's fear.

569
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,340
I knew it would control him.

570
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,303
Make him self-destruct.

571
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,781
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

572
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,226
Men of peace create engines of war.

573
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,902
Invaders create Avengers.

574
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,585
People create

575
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,142
smaller people? Uh...

576
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,343
"Children."
I lost the word, there.

577
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,825
Children

578
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,221
designed to supplant them,

579
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,150
to help them end.

580
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,181
Is that why you've come,
to end the Avengers?

581
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,621
I've come to save the world.

582
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,951
But also... Yeah.

583
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,824
We'll move out right away.

584
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,465
This is a start, but there's something

585
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,105
we need to begin the real work.

586
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,229
- All of these are...
- Me.

587
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,302
I have what the Avengers
never will. Harmony.

588
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,667
They're discordant. Disconnected.

589
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,629
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

590
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,181
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

591
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,462
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

592
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,070
And make them martyrs?

593
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,264
You need patience.

594
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,104
Need to see the big picture.

595
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,503
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

596
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,304
I take it out and look at it,

597
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,261
every day.

598
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,230
You lost your parents in the
bombings. I've seen the records.

599
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,501
The records are not the picture.

600
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,021
- Pietro.
- No, please.

601
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,263
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

602
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,703
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

603
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,862
it makes a hole in the floor.

604
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,545
It's big.

605
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,749
Our parents go in

606
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,943
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

607
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,185
I grab her,

608
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,988
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

609
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,263
But it doesn't go off.

610
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,950
It just

611
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,383
sits there in the rubble.

612
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,667
Three feet from our faces.

613
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,742
And on the side of the shell

614
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,225
is painted one word.

615
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,070
"Stark."

616
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,028
We were trapped for two days.

617
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,309
Every effort to save us,

618
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,990
every shift in the bricks,

619
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,467
I think, "This will set it off."

620
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,185
We wait for two days

621
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,587
for Tony Stark to kill us.

622
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,943
I know what they are.

623
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,866
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.

624
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,021
Now I don't.

625
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,149
We will make it right.

626
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,110
You and I can hurt them.

627
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,868
But you will tear them apart

628
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,703
from the inside.

629
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,506
He's all over the globe.

630
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,829
Robotics labs, weapons facilities,
jet propulsion labs.

631
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,942
Reports of a metal man, or men,

632
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,029
coming in and emptying the place.

633
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,301
Fatalities?

634
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,501
Only when engaged.

635
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,270
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

636
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,621
going on about
old memories, worst fears,

637
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,982
and "something too fast to see."

638
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,511
Maximoffs.

639
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,906
That makes sense he'd go to them.

640
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,465
They have someone in common.

641
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,503
Not any more.

642
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,303
That's a negative. I answer to you.

643
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,707
Yes, ma'am.

644
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,629
Barton. Might have something.

645
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,187
I gotta go.

646
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,501
Who was that?

647
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,540
Girlfriend.

648
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,426
What's this?

649
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,787
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

650
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,031
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.

651
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,591
This is a smoke screen.

652
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,101
Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?

653
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,587
Strucker knew something
that Ultron wanted us to miss.

654
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,509
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

655
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,750
Everything we had
on Strucker's been erased.

656
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,500
Not everything.

657
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,790
Known associates.

658
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,870
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

659
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,351
Well, these people are all horrible.

660
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,469
Wait. I know that guy.

661
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,510
From back in the day.
He operates off the African coast.

662
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,621
Black market arms.

663
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,703
There are conventions.
All right? You meet people.

664
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,191
I didn't sell him anything.

665
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,062
He was talking about finding
something new, a game-changer.

666
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,551
It was all very Ahab.

667
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,466
This?

668
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,621
Ah, it's a tattoo,
I don't think he had it.

669
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,107
Those are tattoos,
this is a brand.

670
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,262
Oh, yeah. It's a word
in an African dialect meaning "thief."

671
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,225
In a much less friendly way.

672
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,264
- What dialect?
- Wakanada.

673
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,109
Wakanda.

674
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,140
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods...

675
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,440
I thought your father said
he got the last of it.

676
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,701
I don't follow.

677
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,470
What comes out of Wakanda?

678
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,223
The strongest metal on Earth.

679
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,911
Where is this guy now?

680
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,109
Don't tell me
your men swindled you.

681
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,740
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers

682
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,386
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

683
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,786
Now, you will make it right,

684
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,103
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

685
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,466
Now, minister, where were we?

686
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,990
Yeah. The Enhanced.

687
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,304
Strucker's prize pupils.

688
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,150
Do you want a candy? Hmm?

689
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,231
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

690
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,384
But then, he knew what kind of
world he was helping create.

691
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,381
Human life. Not a growth market.

692
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,750
You didn't know?

693
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,662
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

694
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,506
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

695
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,981
Everybody is afraid of something.

696
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,101
Cuttlefish.

697
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,760
Deep sea fish.

698
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,510
They make lights, disco lights...

699
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,023
...to hypnotise their prey, and then...

700
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,428
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

701
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,471
So if you're going to fiddle
with my brain

702
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,627
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

703
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,982
then I know you don't do business.

704
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,421
And I know you're not in charge.

705
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,906
And I only deal

706
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,630
with the man in charge.

707
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,061
There is no man in charge.

708
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,744
Let's talk business.

709
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,988
Upon this rock,
I will build my church.

710
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,026
Vibranium.

711
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,141
You know,

712
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,584
it came at great personal cost.

713
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,584
It's worth billions.

714
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,981
Now so are you.

715
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,950
It's all under your dummy holdings.

716
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,062
Finance is so weird.

717
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,661
But I always say,

718
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,942
"Keep your friends rich
and your enemies rich

719
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,909
"and wait to find out which is which."

720
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,827
Stark.

721
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,346
What?

722
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,269
Tony Stark used to say that.

723
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,907
To me.

724
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,941
You're one of his.

725
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,944
What? I'm not...

726
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,307
I'm not.

727
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,950
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

728
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,186
His hollow men?

729
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,827
I mean, look at me.
Do I look like Iron Man?

730
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,311
Stark is nothing!

731
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,267
I'm sorry. I'm... Oh!

732
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,382
I'm sure that's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,184
It's just that I don't understand.

734
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,587
Don't compare me with Stark!

735
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,466
It's a thing with me.

736
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,469
Stark is... He's a sickness!

737
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,304
Ah, Junior.

738
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,705
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

739
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,067
If I have to.

740
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,791
Nobody has to break anything.

741
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,550
Clearly you've never
made an omelette.

742
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,946
He beat me by one second.

743
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,505
Ah, yes. He's funny.

744
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,271
Mr Stark.

745
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,744
It's what? Comfortable?

746
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,666
Like old times?

747
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,981
This was never my life.

748
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,420
You two can still walk away from this.

749
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,025
Oh, we will.

750
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,221
I know you've suffered.

751
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,551
Captain America.

752
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,666
God's righteous man.

753
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,101
Pretending you could live without a war.

754
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,870
I can't physically
throw up in my mouth, but...

755
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,102
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.

756
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,868
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."

757
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,784
Uh-huh. What's the vibranium for?

758
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,080
I'm glad you asked that,

759
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,946
because I wanted to take this time
to explain my evil plan.

760
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,070
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

761
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,581
All of them!

762
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,031
Move! Move! Move!

763
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,351
Oh.

764
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,141
Stay down, kid.

765
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,986
It's time for some mind games.

766
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,627
Guys? Is this a code green?

767
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,080
Thor, status.

768
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,625
The girl tried to warp my mind.

769
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,066
Take special care.

770
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,262
I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

771
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,664
Fortunately, I am mighty.

772
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,667
This is going very well.

773
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,546
I've done the whole mind control thing.

774
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,621
Not a fan.

775
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,228
Yeah, you better run.

776
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,749
Who's ever standing,
we got to move!

777
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,867
Guys?

778
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,906
Again.

779
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,426
You'll break them.

780
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,629
Only the breakable ones.

781
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,625
You're made of marble.

782
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,222
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.

783
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,266
What if I fail?

784
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,140
You never fail.

785
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,903
Are you ready for our dance?

786
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,147
Is it him?

787
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,343
Is that the first son of Odin?

788
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,430
- Heimdall, your eyes.
- Oh.

789
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,989
They see everything.

790
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,627
They see you leading us to Hel.

791
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,980
Wake up!

792
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,948
The war is over, Steve.

793
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,631
We can go home.

794
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,666
Imagine it.

795
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,510
I can still save you!

796
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,148
We're all dead! Can you not see?

797
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,141
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

798
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,302
See where your power leads.

799
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,461
Sloppy.

800
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,141
Pretending to fail.

801
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,505
The ceremony is necessary

802
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,743
for you to take your place in the world.

803
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,821
I have no place in the world.

804
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,101
Exactly.

805
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,021
What can I do?

806
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,261
It hurts.

807
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,547
I'm going to kill him.

808
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,866
- I'll be right back.
- No.

809
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,351
I'm all right.

810
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,346
I want...

811
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,189
I want to finish the plan.

812
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,704
I want the big one.

813
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,349
Uh, the vibranium is getting away.

814
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,631
And you're not going anywhere.

815
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,550
Of course not. I'm already there.

816
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,701
You'll catch on.

817
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,221
But first, you might need
to catch Dr Banner.

818
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,909
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

819
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,549
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

820
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,105
That's not gonna happen.

821
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,710
Not for a while.

822
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,989
The whole team is down.

823
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,586
You got no backup here.

824
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,066
I'm calling in Veronica.

825
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,110
We need backup!

826
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,505
Go! Keep moving!

827
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,022
All right, everybody, stand down!

828
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,626
Will you listen to me?

829
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,381
That little witch is
messing with your mind.

830
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,741
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

831
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,067
You're Bruce Banner.

832
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,301
Right, right, right,
don't mention puny Banner.

833
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,027
Okay!

834
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,031
In the back?

835
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,141
Dick move, Banner.

836
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,065
Veronica, give me a hand.

837
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,107
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

838
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,504
Okay, pal, we're gonna
get you out of town.

839
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,866
Not that way, not that way.

840
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,309
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.

841
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,827
Everybody, out!

842
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,106
Going down?

843
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,860
I'm sorry.

844
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,704
Damage report?

845
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,141
That's comprehensive. Show me something.

846
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,305
How quickly can we buy this building?

847
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,071
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

848
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,907
Flank him, flank him!

849
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,668
The news
is loving you guys.

850
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,350
Nobody else is.

851
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,022
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest

852
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,268
but it's in the air.

853
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,351
- The Stark Relief Foundation?
- Already on the scene.

854
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,304
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...

855
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,226
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

856
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,907
Well, for now,
I'd stay in stealth mode

857
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,266
and stay away from here.

858
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,225
So, run and hide?

859
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,391
Until we can find Ultron,

860
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,310
I don't have a lot else to offer.

861
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,349
Neither do we.

862
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,664
Hey, you wanna switch out?

863
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,100
No, I'm good.

864
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,509
If you wanna get some kip,
now's a good time

865
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,150
because we're still a few hours out.

866
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,830
Few hours from where?

867
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,026
A safe house.

868
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,990
What is this place?

869
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,465
Safe house.

870
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,626
Let's hope.

871
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,707
Honey?

872
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,421
I'm home.

873
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,067
Hi.

874
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,468
Company. Sorry, didn't call ahead.

875
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,581
Hey.

876
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,960
This is an agent of some kind.

877
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,540
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

878
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,383
I know all of your names.

879
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,068
Ooh. Incoming.

880
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,664
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!

881
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,941
Hey, buddy.

882
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,545
How are you guys doing?

883
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,709
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!

884
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,981
Oh, my goodness.

885
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,747
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

886
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,063
Why don't you hug her and find out?

887
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,101
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we would have called ahead,

888
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,222
but we were busy having
no idea that you existed.

889
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,550
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.

890
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,461
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.

891
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,025
I'd like to keep it that way.

892
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,509
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

893
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,065
Honey.

894
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,626
I missed you. How's little Natasha, huh?

895
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,026
She's...

896
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,341
Nathaniel.

897
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,101
Traitor.

898
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,141
Thor?

899
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,103
I saw something in that dream.

900
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:08,826
I need answers. I won't find them here.

901
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,666
We can go home.

902
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,023
See? You worried for nothing.

903
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,268
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

904
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,823
If they're sleeping here, some of them
are gonna have to double up.

905
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,028
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

906
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:51,181
What about Nat and Dr Banner?

907
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,543
How long has that been going on?

908
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,108
Has what?

909
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,989
You are so cute.

910
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,665
Nat and Banner?

911
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:01,791
I'll explain when you're older,

912
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,665
- Hawkeye.
- Well, okay.

913
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,031
It's bad, right?

914
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,541
Nat seems really shaken.

915
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,510
Ultron has these allies.

916
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,861
These, uh, kids.

917
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,550
They're punks, really.

918
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,706
But they carry a big, damn stick.

919
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,026
And Nat took a serious hit.

920
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,700
Someone's gonna have to
teach them some manners.

921
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,709
That someone being you.

922
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,864
You know
I totally support your avenging.

923
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,823
I couldn't be prouder.

924
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,711
But I see those guys...

925
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,868
Those gods...

926
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,589
You don't think they need me.

927
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,901
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

928
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,869
They're a mess.

929
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,861
Yeah.

930
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,065
I guess they're my mess.

931
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,224
You need to be sure

932
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:02,144
that this team is really a team,
and that they have your back.

933
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,071
Things are changing for us.

934
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,581
In a few months' time,

935
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,505
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

936
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,906
I need...

937
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,909
Just be sure.

938
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,230
Yes, ma'am.

939
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:33,303
I can feel the difference.

940
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,945
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

941
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,101
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met.

942
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,307
I didn't.

943
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,950
Do you expect a thank-you note?

944
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,784
I expect you to know why.

945
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,480
The Cradle.

946
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,503
This is the next thing, Tony.

947
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,630
This is the next me.

948
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,591
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

949
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,350
It can't build a living body.

950
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:11,541
It can. You can.

951
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,306
You lack the materials.

952
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,105
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

953
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:23,463
But we all have room to improve.

954
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,661
I didn't realise you were waiting.

955
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:52,183
I would've joined you, but, uh,
it didn't seem like the right time.

956
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:55,222
They used up all the hot water.

957
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,505
I should've joined you.

958
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,310
Missed our window.

959
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,340
Did we?

960
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,026
The world just saw the Hulk.

961
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,623
The real Hulk, for the first time.

962
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:16,511
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?

963
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:21,231
I had this, um, dream.

964
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:26,020
The kind that seems normal at the time,
but when you wake...

965
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,551
What did you dream?

966
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,389
That I was an Avenger.

967
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:33,706
That I was anything more

968
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:36,227
than the assassin they made me.

969
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,782
I think you're being hard on yourself.

970
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,380
Here I was hoping that was your job.

971
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,910
What are you doing?

972
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,349
I'm running with it.

973
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,264
With you.

974
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,341
If running is the plan,

975
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,224
as far as you want.

976
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,864
Are you out of your mind?

977
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,631
I want you to understand that, um...

978
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,151
Natasha,

979
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,705
where can I go?

980
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,101
Where in the world am I not a threat?

981
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:21,541
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?

982
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,269
Even if I didn't just...

983
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,265
There's no future with me.

984
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:29,941
I can't ever...

985
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,421
I can't have this.

986
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,266
Kids.

987
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:37,311
Do the math. I physically can't.

988
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,505
Neither can I.

989
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:48,707
In the Red Room where I was trained...

990
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:51,660
Where I was raised, um,

991
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,271
they have a graduation ceremony.

992
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,709
They sterilise you.

993
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,351
It's efficient.

994
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,625
One less thing to worry about.

995
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:13,108
The one thing
that might matter more than a mission.

996
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,349
Makes everything easier.

997
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:19,980
Even killing.

998
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:28,143
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

999
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,422
So, we disappear?

1000
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,704
Thor didn't say where he was
going for answers?

1001
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:48,306
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

1002
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,468
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.

1003
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,582
Yeah, give him time.

1004
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:55,663
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1005
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,464
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

1006
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:01,224
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1007
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,820
Seems like you walked away all right.

1008
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,501
Is that a problem?

1009
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,783
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1010
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,027
Call me old-fashioned.

1011
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,711
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1012
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,227
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1013
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:18,701
Well, I guess you'd know.

1014
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:20,106
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1015
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,386
Banner and I were doing research.

1016
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,622
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

1017
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,061
Isn't that the mission?

1018
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,500
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1019
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,861
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1020
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,467
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1021
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,150
innocent people die.

1022
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,261
Every time.

1023
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,141
I'm sorry. Mr Stark...

1024
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,101
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1025
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,746
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1026
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,222
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1027
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,430
Don't take from my pile.

1028
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:05,821
Hello, Deere.

1029
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,111
Tell me everything.

1030
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,705
What ails you?

1031
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:13,941
Do me a favour.

1032
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,109
Try not to bring it to life.

1033
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,785
Why, Ms Barton, you little minx.

1034
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,666
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1035
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,066
Was she ever not working for you?

1036
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,670
Artificial intelligence.

1037
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,350
You never even hesitated.

1038
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:31,704
Look, it's been a really long day,
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1039
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:33,788
so how's about we skip
to the part where you're useful.

1040
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,620
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.

1041
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,351
You're not the director of me.

1042
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,303
I'm not the director of anybody.

1043
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,224
I'm just an old man

1044
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,470
who cares very much about you.

1045
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,149
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

1046
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,106
I saw it.

1047
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,870
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1048
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,983
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1049
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,865
The whole world, too.

1050
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,301
Because of me.

1051
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,985
I wasn't ready.

1052
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,871
I didn't do all I could.

1053
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,982
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1054
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:13,102
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1055
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,507
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1056
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,982
The end of the path I started us on.

1057
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,942
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1058
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,671
War isn't one of them.

1059
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,705
I watched my friends die.

1060
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,982
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1061
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,865
Nope.

1062
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,386
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part

1063
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,706
is that you didn't.

1064
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:48,501
I'll see you tonight.

1065
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,546
I like the look.

1066
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:56,226
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

1067
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,627
I need your help.

1068
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:58,861
It's nice to be needed.

1069
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,625
It's dangerous.

1070
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,989
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1071
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,222
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1072
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,550
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1073
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,266
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1074
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,870
I don't think it's just one thing.

1075
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,311
What about Ultron himself?

1076
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,787
Oh, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1077
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,587
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1078
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:27,070
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1079
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,381
Is he still going after launch codes?

1080
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,025
Yes, he is.

1081
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,630
But he's not making any headway.

1082
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,822
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1083
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:36,520
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1084
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,621
Nexus?

1085
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:39,390
It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

1086
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,584
Every byte of data flows through there.

1087
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:42,867
Fastest access on Earth.

1088
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,067
So, what did they say?

1089
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,064
He's fixated on the missiles.

1090
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,904
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1091
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:49,461
By whom?

1092
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,906
Parties unknown.

1093
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,226
Do we have an ally?

1094
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,661
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1095
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,863
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1096
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:59,141
I might need to visit Oslo.

1097
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,781
Find our unknown.

1098
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,385
Well, this is good times, boss,

1099
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,901
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,
you'd have more than that.

1100
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,182
I do. I have you.

1101
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,824
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1102
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,266
Ears, everywhere else.

1103
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:14,624
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

1104
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,622
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1105
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:21,350
with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world.

1106
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,102
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1107
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,745
between him and his mission.

1108
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,022
And whether or not he admits it,

1109
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,911
his mission is global destruction.

1110
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,302
All this, laid in a grave.

1111
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,024
So stand.

1112
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:41,549
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1113
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:43,420
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1114
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:44,941
You know what, Romanoff?

1115
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,471
So, what does he want?

1116
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:50,909
To become better.

1117
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,385
Better than us.

1118
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,141
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1119
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,344
The human form is inefficient.

1120
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,662
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1121
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,748
But he keeps coming back to it.

1122
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:05,351
When you two programmed him to protect
the human race, you amazingly failed.

1123
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:07,503
They don't need to be protected.

1124
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:09,710
They need to evolve.

1125
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,828
Ultron's going to evolve.

1126
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,067
How?

1127
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,065
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

1128
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,470
It's beautiful.

1129
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,824
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

1130
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,180
they're binding them.

1131
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:30,946
And S.H.I.E.L.D.
never even thought to...

1132
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,751
The most versatile substance
on the planet,

1133
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,340
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

1134
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,666
Typical of humans.

1135
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:40,386
They scratch the surface and never think

1136
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:43,865
to look within.

1137
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,825
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1138
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,028
All right. Strictly recon.
I'll hit the Nexus.

1139
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,266
I'll join you as soon as I can.

1140
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,905
If Ultron's really building a body...

1141
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,665
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1142
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,941
Maybe all of us.

1143
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,269
An android designed by a robot.

1144
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,626
You know, I really miss the days

1145
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,908
when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.

1146
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,150
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1147
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,586
You mind if I borrow Ms Hill?

1148
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:15,584
She's all yours. Apparently.

1149
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,901
What are you gonna do?

1150
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:20,143
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.

1151
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,184
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom
as soon as I get back.

1152
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:30,071
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.

1153
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:31,421
No.

1154
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,585
It's the last project.

1155
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,101
I promise.

1156
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,905
So, this is it.

1157
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,781
The Water of Sight.

1158
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,501
In every realm,
there's a reflection.

1159
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,031
If the water's spirits accept me,

1160
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,148
I can return to my dream

1161
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,385
and find what I missed.

1162
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:15,466
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

1163
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,869
A hacker
who's faster than Ultron?

1164
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,107
He could be anywhere,

1165
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,461
and as this is the centre of everything,

1166
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:25,982
I'm just a guy looking for a needle
in the world's biggest haystack.

1167
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,550
How do you find it?

1168
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,551
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1169
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,311
I'm decrypting nuclear codes
And you don't want me to

1170
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,110
Come and get me.

1171
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,507
Wake up!

1172
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,341
Thor!

1173
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,227
Extinction.

1174
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,828
Cellular cohesion
will take a few hours,

1175
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,421
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.

1176
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,830
We're uploading your cerebral matrix

1177
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,226
now.

1178
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,270
I can read him.

1179
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,545
He's dreaming.

1180
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,589
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1181
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,663
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

1182
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,385
Informational noise. Soon...

1183
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:38,746
How soon?

1184
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,311
I'm not being pushy.

1185
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,190
We're imprinting
a physical brain.

1186
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,785
There are no shortcuts.

1187
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:45,266
Even if your magic gem...

1188
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,280
How could you?

1189
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,427
How could I what?

1190
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:01,863
You said we would destroy the Avengers,

1191
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:03,067
make a better world.

1192
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:04,427
It will be better.

1193
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,747
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...

1194
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:12,546
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.

1195
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,391
And if they don't?

1196
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,706
Ask Noah.

1197
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:17,947
You are a madman.

1198
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:21,507
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events

1199
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:24,743
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

1200
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:27,022
When the Earth starts to settle,

1201
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,429
God throws a stone at it.

1202
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,901
And, believe me, he's winding up.

1203
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:33,866
We have to evolve.

1204
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,581
There's no room

1205
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,546
for the weak.

1206
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,748
And who decides who's weak?

1207
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,349
Life.

1208
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,760
Life always decides.

1209
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:48,787
There's incoming.

1210
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,582
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.

1211
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:01,581
Wait, guys!

1212
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,906
They'll understand.

1213
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,348
When they see, they'll understand.

1214
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:13,028
I just need a little more time.

1215
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:26,548
Two minutes. Stay close.

1216
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:34,741
Dr Cho!

1217
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,185
He's uploading himself into the body.

1218
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,347
Where?

1219
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,680
The real power is inside the Cradle.

1220
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:46,827
The gem,

1221
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:50,311
its power is uncontainable.

1222
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,830
You can't just blow it up.

1223
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:56,021
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

1224
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,187
First, I have to find it.

1225
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,501
Go.

1226
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,100
Did you guys copy that?

1227
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,341
We did.

1228
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,946
I got a private jet
taking off across town.

1229
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,586
No manifest.

1230
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,747
That could be him.

1231
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:09,270
There. It's a truck from the lab.

1232
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,626
Right above you, Cap.

1233
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,709
On the loop by the bridge.

1234
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,301
It's them.

1235
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,871
You got three with the Cradle,
one in the cab.

1236
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,067
I could take out the driver.

1237
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,950
Negative. That truck crashes,
the gem could level the city.

1238
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:22,620
We need to draw out Ultron.

1239
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,388
No, no, no, no.

1240
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:37,267
Leave me alone!

1241
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,584
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

1242
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,230
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

1243
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,387
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1244
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:52,821
Thanks, Barton.

1245
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,621
You know what's in that cradle?

1246
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,829
The power to make real change.

1247
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,351
And that terrifies you.

1248
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,547
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1249
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:26,947
Stop it.

1250
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:40,465
We got a window. Four, three...

1251
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,101
Give him hell.

1252
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:54,471
I'm always picking up after you boys.

1253
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,790
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.

1254
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:59,187
Which way?

1255
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,381
Hard right.

1256
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:02,621
Now.

1257
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,787
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!

1258
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,701
Come on!

1259
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:54,625
Clint, can you draw out the guards?

1260
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:55,787
Let's find out.

1261
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:57,867
Beep, beep!

1262
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,910
They're heading back towards you.

1263
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,186
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

1264
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,751
I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?

1265
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,789
What do you think I've been doing?

1266
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:34,508
Okay, package is airborne.

1267
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,301
I have a clean shot.

1268
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,105
Negative. I am still in the truck.

1269
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:39,261
- What the hell are you...
- Just be ready.

1270
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:40,421
I'm sending the package to you.

1271
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:42,187
How do you want me to take it?

1272
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,622
Uh, you might wish
you hadn't asked that.

1273
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,149
Please, don't do this.

1274
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:01,230
What choice do we have?

1275
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,501
I lost him!

1276
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,025
He's headed your way!

1277
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,027
Nat, we gotta go.

1278
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,149
Nat!

1279
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,181
Cap, you see Nat?

1280
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,711
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!

1281
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,181
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1282
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,341
Go!

1283
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,341
Damn it.

1284
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:46,941
Civilians in our path.

1285
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:49,745
Can you stop this thing?

1286
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:29,951
I'm fine.

1287
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,744
I just need to take a minute.

1288
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:34,109
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1289
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,149
The Cradle. Did you get it?

1290
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:37,830
Stark will take care of it.

1291
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,221
No, he won't.

1292
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:44,946
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1293
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,000
Stark's not crazy.

1294
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,228
He will do anything
to make things right.

1295
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,386
Stark, come in.

1296
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:55,947
Stark.

1297
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,386
Anyone on comms.

1298
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,945
Ultron can't tell the difference

1299
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,421
between saving the world
and destroying it.

1300
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:06,786
Where do you think he gets that?

1301
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,550
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.

1302
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:13,027
But she's alive, or Ultron would
be rubbing our faces in it.

1303
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:14,471
This is sealed tight.

1304
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:18,103
We're gonna need to access
the program, break it down from within.

1305
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:22,066
Any chance Natasha might leave you
a message outside the Internet?

1306
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,227
Old-school spy stuff?

1307
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,509
There are some nets I can cast.

1308
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:26,860
Yeah, I'll find her.

1309
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,224
I can work on tissue degeneration

1310
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:34,549
if you could fry whatever
operational system Cho implanted.

1311
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:35,826
Yeah, about that.

1312
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,261
No.

1313
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,303
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.

1314
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:47,510
Our ally, the guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes,

1315
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,440
I found him.

1316
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,666
Hello, Dr Banner.

1317
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,781
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.

1318
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:58,987
He attacked him because he was
scared of what he can do.

1319
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,790
So Jarvis went underground.

1320
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,390
Scattered, dumped his memory.

1321
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,470
But not his protocols.

1322
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,347
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

1323
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:16,981
So, you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?

1324
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,864
No! Of course not.

1325
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,704
I wanna help you
put Jarvis in this thing.

1326
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,750
We're out of my field, here.

1327
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:26,862
You know bio-organics
better than anyone.

1328
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:30,070
And you just assume
that Jarvis's operational matrix

1329
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,625
can beat Ultron's?

1330
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:35,028
Jarvis has been beating him
from inside without knowing it.

1331
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:36,160
This is the opportunity.

1332
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:38,024
We can create Ultron's perfect self

1333
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,662
without the homicidal glitches
he thinks are his winning personality.

1334
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,862
- We have to.
- I believe it's worth a go.

1335
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,541
I'm in a loop!

1336
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:50,670
I'm caught in a time loop.
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

1337
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,669
I know. I know.
I know what everyone's gonna say.

1338
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:54,748
But they're already saying it.

1339
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:56,461
We're mad scientists.

1340
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,951
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.

1341
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:02,180
Make a stand.

1342
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,070
It's not a loop.

1343
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,064
It's the end of the line.

1344
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:34,708
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

1345
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:38,267
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.

1346
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,104
I don't have anyone else.

1347
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:46,547
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.

1348
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:48,225
Boom! The end.

1349
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,111
Start again.

1350
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,228
The world made clean

1351
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,661
for the new man to rebuild.

1352
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:57,108
I was meant to be new.

1353
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:00,586
I was meant to be beautiful.

1354
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:04,620
The world would have looked
to the sky and seen hope,

1355
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,311
seen mercy.

1356
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,182
Instead, they'll look up in horror

1357
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:10,631
because of you.

1358
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:12,629
You've wounded me.

1359
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:14,984
I give you full marks for that.

1360
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:18,544
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...

1361
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:25,111
...just makes me stronger.

1362
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:07,342
This framework is not compatible.

1363
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,185
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

1364
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:14,146
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.

1365
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:18,343
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?

1366
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,588
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.

1367
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:21,861
You don't know what you're doing.

1368
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,351
And you do?

1369
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:24,701
She's not in your head?

1370
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:26,510
I know you're angry.

1371
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:27,985
Oh, we're way past that.

1372
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,546
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.

1373
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,430
Banner, after everything
that's happened...

1374
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:33,905
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

1375
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:36,387
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!

1376
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,111
No, no. Go on.

1377
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:43,983
You were saying?

1378
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:51,267
Pietro!

1379
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:52,901
What?

1380
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,870
You didn't see that coming?

1381
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:58,221
I'm rerouting the upload.

1382
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,304
Go ahead, piss me off.

1383
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,746
Wait!

1384
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:46,661
I am sorry. That was

1385
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,071
odd.

1386
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,540
Thank you.

1387
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:56,507
Thor.

1388
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,626
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.

1389
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:04,581
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its centre is that.

1390
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,541
What? The gem?

1391
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,271
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

1392
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:10,660
The greatest power in the universe,

1393
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:12,942
unparalleled in
its destructive capabilities.

1394
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:15,028
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.

1395
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:17,666
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

1396
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,021
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

1397
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:20,420
Not alone.

1398
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,743
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?

1399
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:25,545
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

1400
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,824
to create something new.

1401
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,744
I think I've had my fill of new.

1402
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:32,187
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

1403
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:33,826
You're not?

1404
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,550
I'm not Ultron.

1405
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:39,387
I am not Jarvis. I am...

1406
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,911
I am.

1407
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:45,946
I looked in your head

1408
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,424
and saw annihilation.

1409
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:49,945
Look again.

1410
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,550
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

1411
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:54,062
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,

1412
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:56,268
Ultron himself, they all came
from the Mind Stone.

1413
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:58,582
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.

1414
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:00,265
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?

1415
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,861
Are you?

1416
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:05,185
On our side?

1417
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:08,949
I don't think it's that simple.

1418
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,546
Well, it better
get real simple real soon.

1419
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,828
I am on the side of life.

1420
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,425
Ultron isn't.

1421
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,431
He will end it all.

1422
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,503
What's he waiting for?

1423
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:21,661
- You.
- Where?

1424
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:23,261
Sokovia.

1425
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,461
He's got Nat there, too.

1426
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,270
If we're wrong about you,

1427
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,783
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...

1428
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,985
What will you do?

1429
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:43,702
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1430
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:47,422
He's unique and he's in pain.

1431
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:51,551
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

1432
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,387
So, he must be destroyed.

1433
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:57,544
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.

1434
01:35:57,820 --> 01:35:59,470
We have to act now.

1435
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:03,825
And not one of us
can do it without the others.

1436
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:07,743
Maybe I am a monster.

1437
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:10,141
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1438
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,904
I'm not what you are,

1439
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:15,742
and not what you intended.

1440
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,980
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

1441
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,671
But we need to go.

1442
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:36,621
Right.

1443
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:38,500
Well done.

1444
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,307
Three minutes.

1445
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,670
Get what you need.

1446
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,547
Good evening, boss.

1447
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:07,384
No way we all get through this.

1448
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,423
If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.

1449
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,665
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

1450
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:13,191
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1451
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:14,426
I get first crack at the big guy.

1452
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,550
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1453
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:19,061
That's true. He hates you the most.

1454
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,542
Ultron knows we're coming.

1455
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:29,027
Odds are we'll be riding
into heavy fire.

1456
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,269
And that's what we signed up for.

1457
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:34,066
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1458
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:36,670
So our priority

1459
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:38,461
is getting them out.

1460
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:41,624
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

1461
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:50,865
Get off your asses.

1462
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,023
All they want
is to live their lives in peace.

1463
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:55,820
And that's not gonna happen today.

1464
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,309
But we can do our best to protect them.

1465
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:01,545
And we can get the job done.

1466
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:07,227
We find out what Ultron's been building,

1467
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:12,103
we find Romanoff,
and we clear the field.

1468
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:15,463
Keep the fight between us.

1469
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:24,581
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

1470
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:27,501
That we're what's wrong with the world.

1471
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:29,941
This isn't just about beating him.

1472
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,508
It's about whether he's right.

1473
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,027
Natasha!

1474
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,141
Natasha!

1475
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:43,381
Bruce?

1476
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:45,821
You all right?

1477
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:47,027
Yeah.

1478
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:48,869
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.

1479
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:50,948
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.

1480
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:53,588
Yeah. I did.

1481
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,141
So what's our play?

1482
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:02,705
I'm here to get you to safety.

1483
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:05,986
- Job's not finished.
- We could help with the evacuation,

1484
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,983
but I can't be
in a fight near civilians.

1485
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:10,501
And you've done plenty.

1486
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,390
Our fight is over.

1487
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:18,021
So, we just disappear?

1488
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:24,023
Come on.

1489
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:31,061
Your man's in the church, boss.

1490
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:33,023
I think he's waiting for you.

1491
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:39,148
Come to confess your sins?

1492
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:40,500
I don't know. How much time you got?

1493
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:42,150
More than you.

1494
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:44,427
Uh...

1495
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:47,350
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?

1496
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:49,747
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."

1497
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,589
You're stalling to protect the people.

1498
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:54,824
Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?

1499
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:57,620
I've moved beyond
your mission. I'm free.

1500
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,427
What?

1501
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:06,661
You think you were
the only one stalling?

1502
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,030
There's the rest
of the vibranium.

1503
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:10,551
Function, still unclear.

1504
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:11,901
This is how you end, Tony.

1505
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:14,944
This is peace in my time.

1506
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:32,707
Go!

1507
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:39,591
Get off the bridge!

1508
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:44,741
Run!

1509
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,549
Ultron.

1510
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:55,266
My Vision.

1511
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,787
They really did take everything from me.

1512
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,988
You set the terms. You can change them.

1513
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:01,340
All right.

1514
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:26,780
Friday, the Vision?

1515
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:29,022
Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.

1516
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,221
He won't escape through there.

1517
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:36,751
You shut me out.

1518
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:38,426
You think I care?

1519
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:41,626
You take away my world,

1520
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,229
I take away yours.

1521
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:29,986
Friday.

1522
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:32,546
Sokovia is going for a ride.

1523
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:46,550
Do you see

1524
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:48,545
the beauty of it?

1525
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:50,983
The inevitability.

1526
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:54,463
You rise, only to fall.

1527
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:00,064
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.

1528
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:02,709
My swift and terrible sword.

1529
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:04,390
And the earth will crack

1530
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:06,503
with the weight of your failure.

1531
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:11,946
Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.

1532
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,831
It means nothing.

1533
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:16,265
When the dust settles,

1534
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:19,821
the only thing living
in this world will be metal.

1535
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:25,950
We gotta move.

1536
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:27,307
You're not gonna turn green?

1537
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:29,423
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

1538
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:31,946
I adore you.

1539
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:42,503
But I need the other guy.

1540
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:49,104
Let's finish the job.

1541
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:07,311
I really hope this makes us even.

1542
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,668
Now go be a hero.

1543
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:22,063
The vibranium core's
got a magnetic field.

1544
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,222
That's what's keeping the rock together.

1545
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:25,360
If it drops?

1546
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:26,760
Right now, the impact
will kill thousands.

1547
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:29,591
Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.

1548
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:35,982
That building's not clear.
The 10th floor.

1549
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:41,861
Hi.

1550
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:45,347
Okay. Get in the tub!

1551
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:54,023
I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.

1552
01:44:56,820 --> 01:44:58,026
Cap, you got incoming.

1553
01:44:58,180 --> 01:44:59,830
Incoming already came in.

1554
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,980
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.

1555
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:07,509
The rest of us have one job,

1556
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:08,821
tear these things apart.

1557
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:10,744
You get hurt, hurt them back.

1558
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,581
You get killed,

1559
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:14,906
walk it off.

1560
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:50,546
Go, go, go!

1561
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:57,984
How could I let this happen?

1562
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:00,148
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.

1563
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:02,468
Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.

1564
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:03,627
Who cares?

1565
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:05,265
Are you up for this?

1566
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:06,461
Are you?

1567
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,747
Look, I just need to know.

1568
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:10,107
Because the city is flying.

1569
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:12,263
Okay. Look, the city is flying,

1570
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:14,303
we're fighting an army of robots,

1571
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:16,426
and I have a bow and arrow.

1572
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:17,661
None of this makes sense.

1573
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:23,068
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.

1574
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:26,591
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

1575
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:29,744
It doesn't matter
what you did or what you were.

1576
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,546
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.

1577
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,821
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.

1578
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:38,103
But if you step out that door,

1579
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:40,021
you are an Avenger.

1580
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,709
All right. Good chat.

1581
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:51,507
Yeah, the city is flying.

1582
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:26,661
I got you!

1583
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:28,220
Just look at me!

1584
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:36,311
You can't save them all.

1585
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:38,707
You'll never...

1586
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:42,426
"Never" what? You didn't finish!

1587
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:47,750
What, were you napping?

1588
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:10,301
Thor.

1589
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,504
You're bothering me.

1590
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:23,541
Ow!

1591
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,061
All right, we're all clear here.

1592
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,307
We are not clear!

1593
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:53,831
We are very not clear!

1594
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:58,231
All right, coming to you.

1595
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,782
Keep up, old man!

1596
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:04,065
Nobody would know.

1597
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:05,947
Nobody.

1598
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:10,824
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.

1599
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:12,800
"Yeah, he'll be missed,
that quick little bastard.

1600
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:13,901
"I miss him already."

1601
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,621
Hold your fire!

1602
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:41,547
Romanoff!

1603
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:43,061
Thanks!

1604
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,064
The anti-gravs
are rigged to flip.

1605
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:56,342
Touch them, they'll go
full reverse thrust.

1606
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:57,905
The city's not coming down slow.

1607
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:59,146
Spire is vibranium.

1608
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:00,386
If I get Thor to hit it...

1609
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:02,025
It will crack. That's not enough.

1610
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:03,665
The impact would still be devastating.

1611
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:05,151
Maybe if we can
cap the other end.

1612
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:06,990
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1613
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:08,505
That could vaporise the city.

1614
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,343
And everyone on it.

1615
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:19,023
The next wave
is gonna hit any minute.

1616
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:21,148
- What do you got, Stark?
- Huh? Nothing great.

1617
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:24,181
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1618
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:26,747
That'll keep it from impacting
the surface, if you guys can get clear.

1619
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:28,909
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

1620
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:32,030
Impact radius
is getting bigger every second.

1621
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:33,585
We're gonna have to make a choice.

1622
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:35,865
Cap,
these people are going nowhere.

1623
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:39,146
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.

1624
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:42,904
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.

1625
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:44,904
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.

1626
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:46,585
I didn't say we should leave.

1627
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:51,229
There's worse ways to go.

1628
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:59,146
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?

1629
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:02,626
Glad
you like the view, Romanoff.

1630
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,344
It's about to get better.

1631
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:29,666
Nice, right?

1632
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:32,226
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.

1633
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:34,030
She's dusty, but she'll do.

1634
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,825
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1635
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:38,267
Ooh! You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

1636
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:40,587
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1637
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:42,265
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

1638
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:45,065
Disengage in three, two...

1639
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:47,261
Take them out.

1640
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:58,465
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1641
01:51:58,580 --> 01:52:01,026
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.

1642
01:52:02,700 --> 01:52:04,111
This is not so bad.

1643
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:08,711
Let's load them up.

1644
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:15,465
Sir, we have multiple bogies

1645
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:17,941
converging on our starboard flank.

1646
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:19,506
Show 'em what we got.

1647
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:20,861
You're up.

1648
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:27,141
Yes!

1649
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:29,144
Now this is gonna be a good story.

1650
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:33,862
Yup. If you live to tell it.

1651
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:36,022
You think
I can't hold my own?

1652
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,665
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1653
01:52:37,820 --> 01:52:39,663
You had to make it weird.

1654
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:47,470
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.

1655
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:05,831
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

1656
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:07,261
Let's go, everyone!

1657
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:11,782
Number six boat is topped and locked...

1658
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:14,301
Or stocked... Topped...

1659
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,265
It's full of people.

1660
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:19,101
Incoming!

1661
01:53:22,140 --> 01:53:23,187
Oh, God!

1662
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:34,940
You think you're saving anyone?

1663
01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:38,822
I turn that key and drop
this rock a little early

1664
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:41,062
and it's still billions dead.

1665
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,701
Even you can't stop that.

1666
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:45,261
I am Thor, son of Odin,

1667
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:47,701
and as long as
there is life in my breast...

1668
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:51,381
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?

1669
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:00,186
It's terribly well-balanced.

1670
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:04,022
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...

1671
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:07,631
I got it. Create a heat seal.

1672
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:09,080
I could...

1673
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:11,581
I could supercharge
the spire from below.

1674
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:12,787
Running numbers.

1675
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,584
A heat seal could work
with enough power.

1676
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:27,062
- Thor, I got a plan.
- We're out of time.

1677
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:28,466
They're coming for the core.

1678
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:30,389
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.

1679
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:33,749
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.

1680
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:44,100
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1681
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:46,627
Romanoff.

1682
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:49,160
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."

1683
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:50,341
Relax, shellhead.

1684
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,185
Not all of us can fly.

1685
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,624
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1686
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:01,942
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.

1687
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:08,542
Is that the best you can do?

1688
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:19,990
You had to ask.

1689
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:22,421
This is the best I can do.

1690
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:24,190
This is exactly what I wanted.

1691
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:25,871
All of you

1692
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:27,630
against all of me.

1693
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:30,107
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1694
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:32,823
Well, like the old man said...

1695
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:35,141
Together.

1696
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:06,461
You know, with the benefit
of hindsight...

1697
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:16,741
They'll try to leave the city.

1698
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,584
We can't let them, not even one. Rhodey.

1699
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:20,021
I'm on it.

1700
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:21,785
Oh, no. I didn't say you could leave.

1701
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:24,502
War Machine coming at you! Right...

1702
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,265
Okay, what?

1703
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:34,502
We gotta move out.
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

1704
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:35,946
You guys get to the boats.

1705
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:37,909
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.

1706
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:40,546
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.

1707
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:43,501
It's my job.

1708
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:45,781
Nat.

1709
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:47,061
This way.

1710
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,621
Get the people on the boats.

1711
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:53,781
I'm not going to leave you here.

1712
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:54,987
I can handle this.

1713
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:58,540
Come back for me
when everyone else is off.

1714
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:00,270
Not before.

1715
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,026
You understand?

1716
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:04,744
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1717
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:06,221
Go.

1718
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:09,305
Boss, power levels are way below...

1719
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,582
Reroute everything.
We get one shot at this.

1720
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:17,826
I know what I need to do.

1721
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:19,187
The dining room.

1722
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:22,950
If I knock out that east wall, it'd make
a nice workspace for Laura, huh?

1723
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:25,661
Put up some baffling.

1724
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:27,942
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

1725
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:29,181
You guys always eat
in the kitchen anyway.

1726
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:30,865
No one eats in a dining room.

1727
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:37,587
We don't have a lot of time.

1728
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:40,228
So get your ass on a boat.

1729
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:54,306
Hey, big guy.

1730
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:57,864
Sun's getting real low.

1731
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:01,031
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

1732
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:05,150
Secure your gear, find a seat.

1733
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:06,546
Costel!

1734
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:08,746
We were in the market.

1735
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:09,907
Costel!

1736
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:26,668
Thor, I'm gonna
need you back in the church.

1737
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:28,225
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1738
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:30,901
- Everyone else is on the carrier.
- You know, this works,

1739
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,951
we maybe don't walk away.

1740
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:34,661
Maybe not.

1741
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:57,427
I got no strings, so I have fun

1742
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:00,585
I'm not tied up to anyone

1743
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:03,511
Come on. Time to go.

1744
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:37,988
You didn't see that coming?

1745
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:36,024
Oh, for God's sake.

1746
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:54,064
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!

1747
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:07,541
No, no, I'm fine.

1748
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:08,701
Fine.

1749
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:12,588
It's been a long day.

1750
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:28,346
Wanda.

1751
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:32,303
If you stay here, you'll die.

1752
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:35,265
I just did.

1753
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:37,824
Do you know how it felt?

1754
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:54,267
It felt like that.

1755
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:30,910
Thor, on my mark.

1756
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:46,981
Now!

1757
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:17,426
Hey, big guy. We did it.

1758
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:20,144
The job is finished.

1759
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:23,025
Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?

1760
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:29,149
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1761
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:33,388
So help me out. I need you...

1762
02:05:19,060 --> 02:05:20,061
You're afraid.

1763
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:22,141
Of you?

1764
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:23,981
Of death.

1765
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:26,509
You're the last one.

1766
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:29,186
You were supposed to be the last.

1767
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:31,707
Stark asked for a saviour

1768
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:34,424
and settled for a slave.

1769
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:36,941
I suppose we are both disappointments.

1770
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:40,660
I suppose we are.

1771
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:42,541
Humans are odd.

1772
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:48,021
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites

1773
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:51,111
and try to control what won't be.

1774
02:05:52,820 --> 02:05:55,266
But there is grace in their failings.

1775
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:57,503
I think you missed that.

1776
02:05:58,180 --> 02:05:59,261
They're doomed.

1777
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:01,227
Yes.

1778
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:08,384
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.

1779
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:12,462
It's a privilege to be among them.

1780
02:06:12,700 --> 02:06:15,226
You're unbearably naive.

1781
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:16,706
Well...

1782
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,828
I was born yesterday.

1783
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:35,542
Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!

1784
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:37,901
Fat.

1785
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:40,306
One of our tech boys flagged this.

1786
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:43,662
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1787
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:46,305
Could be the Quinjet.

1788
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:50,030
But with Stark's stealth tech,
we still can't track the damn thing.

1789
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:52,945
Right.

1790
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:55,621
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1791
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:58,789
He'll send a postcard.

1792
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:00,789
"Wish you were here."

1793
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:06,028
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.

1794
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:10,431
Did you know then what was gonna happen?

1795
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:14,543
You never know.

1796
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:18,267
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.

1797
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:20,230
I got a great team.

1798
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:23,308
Nothing lasts forever.

1799
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:25,628
Trouble, Ms Romanoff.

1800
02:08:25,860 --> 02:08:29,228
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

1801
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:34,306
The rules have changed.

1802
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,104
We're dealing with something new.

1803
02:08:36,260 --> 02:08:37,546
Oh, the Vision
is artificial intelligence.

1804
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:39,583
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?

1805
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:41,589
No, it's not like a person
lifting the hammer.

1806
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:43,510
Right, different rules for us.

1807
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:44,787
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.

1808
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:47,870
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.

1809
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:50,862
It's safe with the Vision.

1810
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:53,626
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1811
02:08:55,660 --> 02:08:57,628
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...

1812
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:59,549
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1813
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:01,469
I'm gonna miss
these little talks of ours.

1814
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:03,145
Not if you don't leave.

1815
02:09:03,380 --> 02:09:05,109
I have no choice.

1816
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:07,502
The Mind Stone
is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

1817
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:09,031
to show up in the last few years.

1818
02:09:09,140 --> 02:09:10,710
It's not a coincidence.

1819
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:13,304
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

1820
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:15,110
and has made pawns of us.

1821
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:17,109
And once all these pieces
are in position...

1822
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:18,631
Triple Yahtzee.

1823
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:20,305
You think you can find out
what's coming?

1824
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:21,501
I do.

1825
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:23,830
Besides this one,

1826
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:26,307
there's nothing that can't be explained.

1827
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:36,146
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

1828
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,906
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

1829
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:43,590
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1830
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:47,430
I will miss you, Tony.

1831
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:48,661
Yeah?

1832
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:51,266
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1833
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:53,662
Maybe I should
take a page out of Barton's book.

1834
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:56,744
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

1835
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:58,701
The simple life.

1836
02:09:58,980 --> 02:10:01,267
- You'll get there one day.
- I don't know.

1837
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:03,901
Family, stability...

1838
02:10:05,060 --> 02:10:08,189
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

1839
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:11,543
I think someone else came out.

1840
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:16,581
You all right?

1841
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:20,705
I'm home.

1842
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:31,385
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

1843
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:32,871
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1844
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:36,040
I thought you and Tony
were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1845
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:37,187
How do we look?

1846
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:39,707
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

1847
02:10:39,860 --> 02:10:41,544
We got some hitters.

1848
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:44,101
They're good. They're not a team.

1849
02:10:44,260 --> 02:10:45,910
Let's beat them into shape.

1850
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:05,905
Avengers...

1851
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:26,185
Fine.

1852
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:29,463
I'll do it myself.
