1
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,361
Soon this poor villa will be smothered.

2
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,200
To think there were woods
here once.

3
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,706
That'll all be houses.

4
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,605
Yes, there's nowhere to run.

5
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,610
That's right. Good day, Excellency.

6
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,709
Goodbye.

7
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,809
Ah, here you are, dad.
I was looking for you upstairs.

8
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,474
I thought you were already
way out at sea.

9
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,041
Not yet, father.

10
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,255
Isn't it customary to wear a sailor's
cap with the yacht's name on it?

11
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,053
No father, it isn't.

12
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,656
How long will you be away?

13
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,389
Four or five days.

14
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,861
Well, I suppose I'll spend
the weekend alone.

15
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,830
I'll rest. I should have grown used
to it by now.

16
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,369
Used to what, father?

17
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,399
To rest-not only from my
diplomatic duties but as a father.

18
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,269
- Why do you say such things?
- It's the truth.

19
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,415
Allow me at least this much:

20
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,712
after 30 years of never telling
the truth,

21
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,811
I might as well speak truthfully
to my own daughter now.

22
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,483
Any more truths to tell me?

23
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,451
You know it.

24
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:55,256
That one I would beg you to spare me;
goodbye, father.

25
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,964
My darling daughter, that guy -
he'll never marry you.

26
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,704
Up to now, I didn't want
to marry him.

27
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:09,043
It's all the same difference.
Goodbye dear.

28
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:15,386
Good morning.
Have you been waiting long? I'm sorry...

29
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,064
Hurry up, Alvaro. It's late.

30
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,505
I'll wait for you here, right?

31
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,880
- Where are you going now?
- To the café. I'm thirsty.

32
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:21,318
While a man you haven't seen for a month
has been waiting half an hour for you?

33
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,855
I feel as if I'd rather not
see him today.

34
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,982
But we rushed all the way here...

35
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,393
I see... goodbye cruise.

36
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:36,331
It's harrowing having to be apart.
Really.

37
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:43,170
It's difficult keeping a relationship going,
while one is here and the other there.

38
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,238
But it's easy too.

39
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,374
Understand?

40
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:57,316
Whereas when somebody's there
facing you... that's all you get.

41
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,082
Understand?

42
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,491
Let's go back, c'mon.

43
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,197
Anna! I'll be right down!

44
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,719
Well, hello!

45
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,289
Should I give you my profile?

46
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,366
Well? What's wrong with me?

47
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,912
Your friend is downstairs, waiting.

48
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,212
Let her wait.

49
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,554
How are you?

50
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,154
Awful.

51
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,792
Why?

52
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:21,464
Why, why, why, why, eh?

53
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,202
Why, eh? Why, why...

54
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,690
Eh, this one has to starve
for a while yet.

55
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,826
Move, you filthy animal.

56
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,581
It's as smooth as oil.

57
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,581
I don't know why,
but I hate all comparisons involving oil.

58
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,923
'Morning.

59
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,487
Good morning.

60
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,334
Look.

61
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,475
0h, God...

62
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,212
Did you sleep well?

63
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,653
So-so.

64
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,888
Last night I went to bed thinking
I would be able

65
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,893
to reflect upon
so many different things,

66
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,386
and then I fell asleep.

67
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:15,055
I had no idea one could sleep so
well on one of these things.

68
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,294
They rock you.

69
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,297
I slept very badly indeed.

70
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,166
Hello. Ciao.

71
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,503
Good morning.

72
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,104
Sunbathe, instead.

73
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,839
Shall we go for a swim?

74
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,079
Not here. It's frightening.

75
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,562
0nce the Aeolian islands were
many volcanoes.

76
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,127
Twelve years ago when
we came here together,

77
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,695
you came up with the exact same remark.
Think of that!

78
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,234
What's the name of this one?

79
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,837
This should be Basiluzzo.

80
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,881
Basiluzzo... it sounds like
the name of a fish.

81
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,142
That one over there
is Lisca Bianca.

82
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,748
How boring.
Why all of this fuss over a swim?

83
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,193
Careful.

84
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,120
Mario, woman overboard!

85
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,634
Stop...

86
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,564
Stop...

87
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,653
Raimondo?

88
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,553
I'm right here, Patrizia.

89
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,023
Why have we stopped?

90
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,323
And you, won't you come for a swim
Patrizia.

91
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,996
I had a dream I was swimming.
Think of that!

92
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,203
- Lady Patrizia.
- Do you like scuba diving?

93
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:47,468
I simply loath it, yet I must conform,
what can you do?

94
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:06,553
I'd like to know whoever said that
man originally inhabited the sea!

95
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,063
Patrizia, if you give me your
yacht's flag,

96
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,004
I'll go and take the island
in your name.

97
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:18,907
Well!

98
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,179
Islands...
I don't get them...

99
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,017
...surrounded by nothing but water...
poor things...

100
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,957
Cosimo... come...

101
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,788
- Mario, prepare the dinghy.
- Right away, Mr. Corrado.

102
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,908
Sandro, where are you going?

103
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,698
Ask her.

104
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,180
- Working on luxury boats it's harder.
- Why?

105
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:03,109
The owners have no set plans.
Take last night, for instance.

106
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,546
We sailed all night long.

107
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,124
I didn't get any sleep.

108
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,691
Still I prefer it...

109
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,499
Shark! ...
Shark! .

110
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,702
Keep still, miss...
Stay right where you are.

111
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,639
Don't anyone move!

112
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,670
Claudia,
Claudia wait for me.

113
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,606
Go away!

114
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,216
Come.
Hold on.

115
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,375
What's happening?

116
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:02,777
There's a shark around here.
Stay right where you are.

117
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,010
Who's going anywhere?

118
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:11,950
How did you know it was there?
Did it touch you?

119
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,215
I would have died,

120
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,094
with its horrible face and
awful teeth.

121
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,096
Have some cognac, Anna.

122
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,831
It's nothing,
let's go...

123
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,170
It's all over now.

124
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,368
- I'd like to change now. I'm cold.
- Sure.

125
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:32,971
Summer is really over.

126
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,112
I wonder where this shark went.

127
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,831
Well, what is it?

128
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,654
Which shall I wear?

129
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,589
This one, or this?

130
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,586
This one.
This one is divine.

131
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,165
Why don't you try it on?

132
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,443
It looks better on you.

133
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,503
- Keep it.
- 0h, no.

134
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:06,436
The whole shark thing was a lie,
you know.

135
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,139
- A lie?
- Yes.

136
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,208
- Why?
- Because.

137
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,003
But now don't think about it.

138
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,211
It's over.

139
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,051
I don't need to know why
you behave this way.

140
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,082
It's Sandro,
I suppose.

141
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,857
Are you feeling better now,
at least?

142
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,259
C'mon, let's go.

143
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,487
Aren't you going ashore?

144
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,715
Are you calling those rocks
a shore?

145
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,159
And you, were you still swimming
around?

146
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,761
Don't you know there's a shark
in these waters?

147
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,093
A shark?

148
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,967
You mean to tell me I might have
been killed.

149
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,302
Ah well!

150
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,834
0h well... well...
ah yes...

151
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,340
What is it Raimondo?

152
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,743
You want me?
At this time?

153
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,110
See you.

154
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,854
No, Claudia, stay...
there's no spark.

155
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,489
Is this better?
Are you happy?

156
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,151
Tell the truth,
you're a little disappointed.

157
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,196
Not at all.
Quite the opposite.

158
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,255
What sort of a face do you think
Raimondo has?

159
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,891
A rather corrupt one,
I'd say.

160
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,730
Not at all.
He's a child.

161
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,896
Now, don't start that, Patrizia.
I'd rather be corrupt,

162
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,563
unless you happen to love children.

163
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,005
I don't love anyone,
and you know it.

164
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,006
I know, I know.

165
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,913
And to think that if there ever
was a woman

166
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:34,075
created for every kind of deceit
and vice,

167
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,221
of betrayal and debauchery,

168
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,052
she's the very one. And you know what?
She's faithful.

169
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,919
A faithfulness born from a sort
of laziness.

170
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,864
How amusing!
The only amusement I know besides my dog.

171
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,727
Let's go ashore.

172
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,971
There should be some ancient ruins up there.
Let's go see.

173
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,204
- Giulia do you remember?
- Yes.

174
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:04,139
No, it's better if you sleep.
You say: "How beautiful"

175
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,716
no matter what you're looking at:
the sea, a child, a cat.

176
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,844
Your sensitive little heart races
at nothing.

177
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,115
But if something is beautiful,
why shouldn't I say so?

178
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,884
How likable!

179
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:13,890
Who are you talking about?

180
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,586
- The shark.
- Still?

181
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,260
How wonderful.

182
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,381
Corrado,
would you like one?

183
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,612
This is Patrizia's way to share
our company.

184
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,480
You know,
I find you very pleasant.

185
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,520
More than the shark?

186
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:43,980
Ah, there is no comparison.

187
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,415
Won't you come with me to take
a look at those ruins then?

188
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,486
It could be something to do.
But no, we'd better stay here.

189
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:59,770
Sandro... A month is too long a time.
I had grown used to being alone.

190
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,697
It's the usual uneasiness.
Then you'll get over it.

191
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,602
I felt it a little more this time.

192
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,940
It'll take a little more
to go away, then.

193
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,178
Instead I think we should talk about it.

194
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,309
0r are you convinced that even between us
we're unable to understand one another?

195
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,752
We'll have so much time to talk.
We're getting married.

196
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,312
What's more time than a lifetime?

197
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,656
Under these circumstances getting
married would mean nothing.

198
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,723
Aren't we already acting
as if we were married?

199
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,827
Giulia and Corrado, aren't they living
as though they were married?

200
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,169
Why should we be here talking,
arguing?

201
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,478
Believe me Anna, words are becoming
less and less necessary,

202
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,914
they create misunderstandings.

203
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,317
I care for you Anna,
isn't this enough?

204
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,917
No.
It isn't enough,

205
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,791
I'd like to spend some time alone.

206
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,693
But if you just said that one month...

207
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,426
To be alone longer:
two months, a year, three years!

208
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,265
I know it's absurd.

209
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,239
I'm distraught. The idea of losing you,
makes me want to die...

210
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:19,443
and yet...
I don't feel you anymore.

211
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,690
Even yesterday, at my place,
you didn't feel me any more?

212
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,964
You always need to
vilify everything.

213
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,356
The weather's changing.

214
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:37,528
Please Giulia, there's no need to be
so literal all the time.

215
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,394
I can see it by myself that
the weather is changing.

216
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,032
We should leave now.

217
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,232
The sea is getting rough.

218
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:23,766
And Anna?

219
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,006
I don't know.

220
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,681
I thought I heard a boat.

221
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,279
- You hear it?
- Yes.

222
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,217
Sandro!
Where's Anna?

223
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:46,828
She was here.

224
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,696
- Isn't she onboard?
- I wouldn't know, miss.

225
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,264
Patrizia.

226
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,234
Is Anna there?

227
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,083
No.
She's not here.

228
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,189
This is one of those typical
'Anna behaviors' that drives me mad.

229
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,899
This island is so beautiful,
isn't it?

230
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:41,568
Did you find her?

231
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,209
Sandro!
Nothing?

232
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,544
Have you noticed?

233
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,292
- Have you noticed how he treats me?
- Who?

234
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:01,627
Corrado.
Today he's done nothing but belittle me.

235
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:02,963
Giulia!

236
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:18,772
Sandro!
Sandro!

237
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,743
Nothing...

238
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,515
Not even a trace.

239
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,548
Guys, let's choose a practical approach.
You go to the nearest island,

240
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:34,352
there must be a police station, the
coast guard or whatever the hell might be,

241
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,949
and report Anna as missing.

242
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,355
I'll stay here 'cause,
'cause I don't know...

243
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,364
I feel something might happen.

244
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,764
Anyway I don't feel I could leave.

245
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:50,272
Well then, let's go.
There's no point in wasting more time.

246
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,970
How long will it take to get there
and back?

247
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,470
If the station is at Panarea,
a couple of hours.

248
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,948
But if we have to go to Lipari,
it will take much longer.

249
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,850
- It also depends on the sea.
- 0f course... the sea...

250
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,184
I'm staying with Sandro.

251
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,254
Why?
And if it rains?

252
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,152
Well if it rains,
I'll buy an umbrella.

253
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,038
I'm not leaving.

254
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:27,834
Claudia, I understand you,
but we're already staying behind.

255
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,107
And I'll say this too...
your presence here -

256
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,172
and please don't mind my saying so
- Might get in the way.

257
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,733
Darn it, we forgot to ask them
to leave us some light.

258
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,071
Ah, here's a lantern at least.

259
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,940
I think she's still alive.

260
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,844
Even this morning...
that story of the shark... it wasn't true.

261
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,583
- Why did you wait 'til now to tell us?
- I don't know...

262
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,921
I didn't think it would make any difference...
she was laughing...

263
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,223
Right...
what we need to understand is why

264
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,754
she made up this shark charade.
What was she trying to achieve?

265
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,192
- Perhaps we'd better ask him.
- Me?

266
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,298
Why?
Did you quarrel?

267
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,100
I don't mean to pry,
but it's very important.

268
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,578
0h, the usual arguments...

269
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,146
The only thing,
if I remember correctly,

270
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,210
is that she wanted to be alone.

271
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,811
And how's that?

272
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,082
What is this?
What are you doing?

273
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:32,123
Are you the owner?

274
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,859
No.
The owners are in Australia.

275
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,994
I was in Australia too...
for 30 years.

276
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,641
My nephew...
those were the times!

277
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,081
Where did you come from?

278
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:58,087
- You weren't around while we were searching.
- From Panarea.

279
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,052
From Panarea.
Then it was you today.

280
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,094
I saw a rowboat go by
around two.

281
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,560
It must have been four
or five o'clock.

282
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,093
- This afternoon.
- No, this morning.

283
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,235
Why? What happened?
What happened?

284
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:18,735
Nothing...
nothing...

285
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,769
Why don't you tell him?

286
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,577
A girl from our party has
disappeared.

287
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,475
Disappeared how?
Drowned?

288
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,345
No. She's disappeared,
and we don't know how.

289
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,757
And it's all my fault...

290
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,519
why don't you say this too?
It's what you're thinking.

291
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,288
You should have made more
of an effort trying to understand

292
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,259
Anna's thoughts, rather than being
so concerned with mine.

293
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,602
Did you look behind the house?
She might have fallen from these cliffs.

294
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,031
'Cause last month the same thing
happened to a lamb of mine.

295
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,645
I looked for it all day,
and only at nightfall I heard it bleating.

296
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,274
It must have been...

297
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,155
Come Claudia,
come back inside.

298
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,265
How are you?
Feeling any better?

299
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,202
About last night...
I'm sorry.

300
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,683
You love Anna very much.

301
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:24,685
Yes, very.

302
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,958
Did she ever talk to you about me?

303
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,528
Seldom.
But always tenderly.

304
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:50,645
And still... she acted as though our love,
yours, her father's, mine,

305
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:55,114
in a manner of speaking,
was nothing to her, meant nothing to her.

306
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,721
Sometimes I wonder what it is
I could have done...

307
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,688
to prevent all of this
from happening.

308
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:29,508
Whose boat is that?

309
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,541
What boat?

310
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,211
A moment ago.
Didn't you hear?

311
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,780
There are so many boats around
here during the summer.

312
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,982
Why did you get up so early?

313
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,416
Do you call 5 in the morning early?

314
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,040
Bartolo!
What then?

315
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:50,175
Nothing,
nothing.

316
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:52,984
Nothing.

317
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,292
Why are you looking at me
this way Marshal?

318
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:57,854
We're not there yet,
you know.

319
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:11,458
I hope they're not the ones to find her.
That would mean she's dead.

320
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,050
Listen Patrizia...

321
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,784
apparently there's a current that
heads straight from here

322
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:37,190
to another island. I don't know which,
but this is another clue.

323
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,494
The Marshal said he'll send one
of his men there...

324
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,220
you never know...

325
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,896
Would you mind if...

326
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,866
Would you mind if I ask
Raimondo to go with him?

327
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,065
I don't see why.

328
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,505
I think you should be the one
to go there.

329
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:59,307
Yes. Yes, perhaps that
would be better...

330
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,020
Sandro really astonishes me.

331
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,156
- He seems so self-possessed.
- Self-possessed?

332
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,925
I don't think so...
He was up all night.

333
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,674
- What's that?
- An ancient vase.

334
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,976
There's a city buried under here.
There's plenty of this stuff.

335
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,644
And of course here he comes.

336
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:44,049
- Let me see it.
- Go on, from which period is it?

337
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:48,759
Corrado, why don't we ask
if we may have it.

338
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,460
Right, so you can plant one
of your geraniums in it.

339
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,229
- Weren't you supposed to leave?
- No, it's useless!

340
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:06,804
What a shame!

341
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:10,218
It figures.

342
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,923
Look,
Anna's father is here.

343
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,708
I looked into Anna's suitcase and...

344
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,386
Yes... it's Anna's...
she gave it to me yesterday...

345
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:48,223
I found it in my bag...
I didn't want to...

346
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:52,524
But I had nothing else to wear
this morning... I'm sorry.

347
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,192
I found these in her suitcase.

348
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:14,241
This is a good sign, don't you think?
Someone who reads the Bible,

349
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:18,918
wouldn't do anything rash,
it must mean she believes in God.

350
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:21,813
So we can rule out the suicide
hypothesis, right?

351
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:52,976
Thank you,
anyway.

352
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:06,092
Brigadier... come,
I have important news.

353
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:08,996
What news?

354
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,194
They've stopped a suspicious boat
a few miles from here.

355
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,000
The crew is in Milazzo,
waiting to be questioned.

356
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,797
We must go there and see.

357
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,097
Right,
we must.

358
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:34,417
Did you hear?

359
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,052
We're in the hands of God.

360
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:40,023
I agree.
But I think we should go to Milazzo!

361
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,260
Forgive my earnestness,
and try to understand,

362
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,871
I am the one closest
to your daughter.

363
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,766
Even if you were,
right now my daughter needs me more.

364
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:05,350
And you,
what are you going to do?

365
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:09,859
What should we do? We really don't know.
We'll go visit the Montaldos.

366
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:30,112
I'll get my bag.
I'm sorry.

367
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:37,280
It's all right.

368
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:03,066
- I'll join you at the Montaldos then.
- Fine.

369
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:08,140
I think this is the best solution.
Ettore should be there already.

370
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,178
- I'm going to scour all of those other islands.
- What?

371
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:17,083
I can't leave unless I've been there,
to every single one of them.

372
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,523
But aren't you tired?
I can hardly stand.

373
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,553
I am here, Patrizia,
I'm always here.

374
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,159
Claudia is not coming with us.
Will you take care of her bag?

375
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:04,060
I've heard you're having trouble
at home, is that so?

376
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,125
Yes, my sister has been ill for a year...
and my father too.

377
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:12,770
So, that's why you're a smuggler...
you need money. I can help you,

378
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:16,007
I can see that you get State benefits,
if you want to.

379
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,138
But first, let's take care
of a few formalities.

380
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:21,750
A few questions and then
we're all off to lunch.

381
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,487
Your partner told me that you
dropped the net three times.

382
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,046
Yes, yes,
three times.

383
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:30,652
Get the others in here.

384
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:39,563
Here!

385
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,972
We're nearly there. They're starting
to contradict one another. I'm sorry.

386
01:00:55,785 --> 01:01:00,620
Your partner told me you couldn't
fish 'cause the sea was rough.

387
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:02,321
Is that right?

388
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,553
- And what about the other boat?
- What boat?

389
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,256
Careful,
my men saw it

390
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,996
and they saw you throwing
the crates overboard.

391
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:18,798
Well then.
What's the story?

392
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,239
I wasn't feeling well...

393
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,438
I'm confused...
I don't know anything.

394
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:26,640
What is he saying?

395
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,513
- What are you saying?
- Please...

396
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,453
What does Anna have to do
with all of this?

397
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,215
Stay here, calm down.

398
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:43,289
I'm ready to forget everything:
the cigarettes, the smuggling,

399
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:47,302
as long as you tell me if you
brought the girl somewhere...

400
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:01,511
What did you say?

401
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,858
This is the guy who built the villa.

402
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,129
He would have never thought
it would end up being used this way.

403
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:33,080
Lieutenant, do you know this F.Z.
who wrote the article in the paper?

404
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:37,082
- Francesco Zuria, the correspondent.
- Where could I find him?

405
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,917
And if I were to offer a reward in
exchange for any information...

406
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,421
Well... Zuria is in Messina.
You can try.

407
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,359
- Would you like me to call him?
- No, no thank you. Don't bother.

408
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,361
Do you have any orders, Sir?
May I return to Lipari?

409
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,991
Yes. Where did you put
the case of cigarettes?

410
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:53,296
- In the storeroom.
- Fine.

411
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,734
At your command.

412
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:57,301
Sergeant...

413
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,147
Excuse me... Sergeant...
When did you get here?

414
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,314
Two hours ago.

415
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,779
And the young lady who was with you,
where is she?

416
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:13,413
I don't know.
She said she had a train to catch.

417
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,093
Where are you going?
To the Montaldos?

418
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,299
I'll go with you.

419
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:05,770
Did you read this?

420
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:12,276
They're asking anyone who might
know something to get in touch.

421
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,175
Yes, I even thought to go there
myself and have a word...

422
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:21,383
- Yes, you must go.
- When will I see you, then?

423
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,514
I know it's complicated.

424
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,790
But if you carry on this way it
becomes even more so.

425
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:09,070
Please don't look so sullen...

426
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,768
And don't wait for the train...

427
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,298
I beg you,
leave.

428
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,072
Milazzo.

429
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:04,590
Watch your hands,
please.

430
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,241
I'd really want to know what
is there to be said now?

431
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:02,215
Go on,
speak.

432
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,749
Sandro, I don't want you with me,
I don't want to see you.

433
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,848
Do you hear me?

434
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,056
- Why did you come?
- I couldn't help it.

435
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:17,162
As you'll have to,
this sacrifice is better if made right now.

436
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,042
Sacrifice! I have no intention
of sacrificing myself -

437
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:31,179
it's idiocy sacrificing oneself...
Why? For whom?

438
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:36,944
I would understand your qualms
if Anna were here. But she's not.

439
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,043
Sandro!

440
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:44,124
Sorry,
I don't mean to sound jaded.

441
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,218
But wouldn't it be much better to
look at things for what they are?

442
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:50,459
To me they're exactly the same as
three days ago when we first met.

443
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:54,662
Just three days ago,
can you imagine?

444
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,229
And you and Anna...

445
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,364
No, no, no,
they're not the same.

446
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:05,608
And yet how can it be that it takes
so little to change, to forget?

447
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:07,340
It takes even less.

448
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:11,749
But it's sad.
It's terribly sad.

449
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,952
And I am not used to it.
I'm not prepared for it.

450
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:22,687
To feel this way.
I've never felt so confused in my whole life.

451
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,361
Sandro,
why don't you help me?

452
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:29,905
I think the only way we can help
each other is by staying together.

453
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,102
No.
I'm sure that's not it.

454
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,879
Stay there,
stay there and get off at the next stop.

455
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:37,573
And you?

456
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,441
Me... me... me...
let me be!

457
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,792
I don't mean to intrude,
but as this is a Palermo-bound train,

458
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,529
would you happen to be traveling
to that destination?

459
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:01,331
No.

460
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,871
- To Tindari, then?
- No.

461
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:05,804
- Sant'Agata di Miniatello.
- No.

462
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,502
- It must be Cefalù, then.
- How did you know?

463
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:10,909
Through an acquaintance.

464
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,738
I work for a Cefalù's family,
but I'm not from there.

465
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,980
I am telling you.
This acquaintance of mine knows you,

466
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:20,180
and has told me lots about you.

467
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,016
And who is it?
Does he work in Cefalù?

468
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:25,488
- Yes, she's a gardener.
- Impossible.

469
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:30,058
The gardener at the villa
where I work is a man.

470
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,333
It must have been
them talking.

471
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,262
And what did they tell you
about me?

472
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,737
0h, lots and lots.
They told me

473
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:39,397
you're a well-brought- Up girl,
that you mind your business,

474
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,805
this sort of thing.

475
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:43,409
We have a radio just like this one.

476
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,945
- No, not like this one.
- Why not like this one?

477
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:47,881
Because this one was made
in China.

478
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:54,782
These small radios are handy
for sure.

479
01:09:55,925 --> 01:10:00,259
Especially, I don't know...
going for a walk...

480
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,157
Which comes first for you?
Music or love?

481
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:08,060
Music of course.
A fiancée you've gotta look for,

482
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:09,698
but a radio can be bought.

483
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:11,401
Ah no,
love for me.

484
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,635
I am a man and I know about
this kind of thing.

485
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:16,000
Love first,
then music.

486
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,741
- No, Claudia, listen.
- Sandro please...

487
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,483
do it for me... promise
you won't look for me...

488
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,255
- You must stop looking for me...
- But why Claudia? Why?

489
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,486
Listen, even if you
send me away, I...

490
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,658
Claudia, Claudia I don't want
to wait anymore...

491
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,330
Later it might never happen...
come away with me...

492
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,152
Claudia...

493
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:01,881
Zuria.
Which one of you is Zuria?

494
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,279
What do I know?
He might be inside.

495
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:09,050
I called you, officer,
'cause the situation seemed to be getting

496
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,158
out of hand, and your presence
might become necessary...

497
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,022
- They're breaking everything...
- Pardon me, are you Mr. Zuria?

498
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,193
That's me all right.

499
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:17,862
- May I ask you a question?
- Lf you can wait. I am busy now.

500
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:23,631
I was looking for a notions shop
and noticed these men following me.

501
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:27,169
I've never seen anything like it...
so many men!

502
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,007
Easy to believe,
the way you dress...

503
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,312
I went all over the world
dressed this way.

504
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:35,275
0h, not like this,
though.

505
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:40,150
My skirt came unstitched,
that's why I was looking for a notions shop.

506
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:42,747
How old are you?

507
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:47,327
Nineteen. I'm married.
My name is Gloria Perkins

508
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,427
and for the past year I've been
a writer.

509
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:54,101
I write while in a trance
and I'm usually in touch with the dead,

510
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,502
Tolstoy, for instance,
or Shakespeare.

511
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,868
But I am also interested in working
in the movies.

512
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:05,213
And how did they welcome you
in Palermo?

513
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:07,748
In Palermo
I was with my husband.

514
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,677
Right now I'm on my way to Capri
to write on tourism.

515
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:16,691
Exactly the same thing happened
in Palermo.

516
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,690
Miss, if you want to go back
to your hotel,

517
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:20,388
- We're here to escort you.
- 0h, yes.

518
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:27,694
0ut, away,
out, out.

519
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,073
It's a disgrace.

520
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:44,775
What are you doing here,
move.

521
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:50,185
For a woman!
How disgusting.

522
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:10,340
Like her?

523
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,175
- Fifty thousand!
- No!

524
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:17,284
Why all of this racket then?
It's all a ruse to be noticed.

525
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:20,844
And even if only one gets hooked up,
she's all right for a while.

526
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:23,892
Ah well, if fifty thou weren't
a month's worth of my wages,

527
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,757
that's one of those whims
I would have indulged, I assure you.

528
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:28,421
So what did you want
to talk about?

529
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:31,498
I read your article on that girl's
disappearance. I am her boyfriend.

530
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:33,865
Would you mind telling me
the whole story

531
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:35,494
about this disappearance without
omitting any detail?

532
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:38,802
Look, I wouldn't be here if I had any clues.
And I see you don't have any either.

533
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:41,069
0n the contrary,
I've received several calls.

534
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,910
In one they said she had been
spotted in a car in Rome,

535
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:47,737
another at the port talking
to foreign sailors.

536
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,512
And if she sailed away in secret?

537
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,052
- Does it still happen?
- What do I know?

538
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:55,984
Somebody said they'd seen her
at a chemist in Troina...

539
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,922
Actually the chemist himself says
that a girl fitting the description,

540
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:01,756
went into his store in Troina
to buy a tranquilizer.

541
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,727
- Is this place far?
- About fifty kilometers from here.

542
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,594
If you'd like,
I can get the name of this chemist.

543
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,601
Yes...
yes why not.

544
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,071
But you must write it in your paper
no later than tomorrow morning.

545
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,235
Yours is one of Palermo's newspapers,
isn't it?

546
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:15,441
I mean,
does it have a lot of readers?

547
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,238
Yes,
but the whole thing is stale now...

548
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:20,575
it's stale... has lost its appeal,
the editor won't print it.

549
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,682
No, no, no.
You should really do this for me.

550
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:27,187
Please, don't take it badly,
but why should I do you a favor?

551
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,585
Let's say it's business,
then.

552
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:32,359
To help you round up
your salary.

553
01:15:43,703 --> 01:15:47,161
- I went to every single one of those islands.
- It must have been exhausting.

554
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,639
Useless,
more than anything else.

555
01:15:58,185 --> 01:15:59,743
I can't stand it anymore.

556
01:16:01,555 --> 01:16:04,046
- Agreed, until tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

557
01:16:05,292 --> 01:16:07,487
How can you talk business
in this heat?

558
01:16:07,994 --> 01:16:12,226
When you're past fifty, my darling,
you only feel the cold.

559
01:16:12,432 --> 01:16:13,364
And what is this?

560
01:16:13,533 --> 01:16:17,629
It's Claudia, Anna's friend...
You haven't met my husband, have you?

561
01:16:17,804 --> 01:16:18,532
Ah, fine.

562
01:16:18,905 --> 01:16:20,372
Imagine that
she's just back from...

563
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:23,304
- Incidentally, did you call him?
- Sandro?

564
01:16:23,677 --> 01:16:25,201
Didn't he say he would have
joined us here?

565
01:16:25,579 --> 01:16:27,046
This really
shouldn't have happened.

566
01:16:28,081 --> 01:16:32,245
And how can I negotiate,
when all the data's missing...

567
01:16:32,619 --> 01:16:37,056
I feel it's good news he hasn't been
in touch. I bet he's found her.

568
01:16:37,357 --> 01:16:39,120
When you consider that in Italy

569
01:16:39,192 --> 01:16:41,422
there's a disappearance rate of 40
thousand people a year,

570
01:16:41,595 --> 01:16:44,621
that is almost enough to fill
San Siro's stadium.

571
01:16:44,965 --> 01:16:48,230
I don't know this Sandro.
What's he like?

572
01:16:48,301 --> 01:16:50,701
Maybe he's done away with her.

573
01:16:52,906 --> 01:16:56,103
Good Lord, we're making a joke
of something like this.

574
01:16:56,543 --> 01:16:58,875
We ought to be ashamed
of ourselves.

575
01:17:01,514 --> 01:17:02,503
Coming?

576
01:17:11,825 --> 01:17:14,589
Princess, this villa -
why don't you sell it?

577
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:17,323
I'd make it into a lovely clinic
for nervous disorders.

578
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:19,422
It's already a little like that.

579
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:25,494
Goffredo is the princess' grandson.
He's 17, think of that!

580
01:17:25,905 --> 01:17:27,497
And a painter.

581
01:17:27,907 --> 01:17:32,537
Anyone can hold a brush.
Just buy the paint and get down to it.

582
01:17:32,612 --> 01:17:34,773
Even Titian
started this same way.

583
01:17:38,018 --> 01:17:40,714
- So, what's your style? Abstract?
- No.

584
01:17:40,787 --> 01:17:43,984
- And what do you feel when you're painting?
- A shudder.

585
01:19:11,845 --> 01:19:14,245
Are you ready?
'Cause I'm not.

586
01:19:15,315 --> 01:19:17,715
All we needed was this dinner...

587
01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:21,044
All these people's vitality
irritates me.

588
01:19:22,222 --> 01:19:23,849
- How does it look?
- Divine.

589
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:27,626
- You're just saying that to flatter me.
- Why, is that a compliment?

590
01:19:29,896 --> 01:19:30,590
No.

591
01:19:47,514 --> 01:19:49,345
You look like somebody else.

592
01:20:12,305 --> 01:20:13,329
Shall we?

593
01:20:15,508 --> 01:20:16,839
I'm going down.

594
01:20:44,471 --> 01:20:49,909
He wants to show me his paintings.
And won't let me go.

595
01:20:51,077 --> 01:20:53,705
The poor thing must have a crush.

596
01:20:54,647 --> 01:20:56,581
Please come along...

597
01:21:00,954 --> 01:21:02,319
Why should I?

598
01:21:04,991 --> 01:21:07,050
Well, you can't leave me alone
with him.

599
01:21:07,494 --> 01:21:11,260
He could... well, I don't know...
didn't you see his eyes?

600
01:21:13,299 --> 01:21:14,323
We're coming.

601
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,845
Giulia,
what am I coming for?

602
01:21:50,837 --> 01:21:53,271
Claudia, come see.
A nude.

603
01:21:58,745 --> 01:22:00,406
If I'm not mistaken they're all nudes.

604
01:22:12,926 --> 01:22:16,191
You're good.
But why paint only women?

605
01:22:16,896 --> 01:22:19,296
No landscape is as lovely
as a woman.

606
01:22:22,936 --> 01:22:24,301
And how do you get your models?

607
01:22:24,637 --> 01:22:25,934
0h,
they're a dime a dozen.

608
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:32,171
I thought models were a thing of the past,
didn't you, Claudia?

609
01:22:32,946 --> 01:22:33,674
Um?
What?

610
01:22:44,757 --> 01:22:47,021
It's strange how women enjoy
showing themselves.

611
01:22:47,393 --> 01:22:49,122
Seems almost in their nature.

612
01:22:56,302 --> 01:22:58,998
How can they pose that way.
I couldn't.

613
01:23:01,374 --> 01:23:02,272
Why don't you try?

614
01:23:17,223 --> 01:23:18,520
- Try.
- Me?

615
01:23:19,192 --> 01:23:22,457
Are you crazy, Goffredo?
He's crazy.

616
01:23:24,664 --> 01:23:25,631
Not really.

617
01:23:34,841 --> 01:23:37,435
Don't you ever sketch men?

618
01:23:38,411 --> 01:23:41,471
Why don't you answer?
Why don't you try?

619
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:46,240
I'd make you a beautiful portrait.

620
01:23:47,487 --> 01:23:49,284
Why are you so particular
about me?

621
01:23:49,355 --> 01:23:51,289
Ask Claudia,
she's so much more beautiful than me.

622
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:55,718
But it's you I want.
You appeal to me more.

623
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,394
Appeal to you more?

624
01:24:33,599 --> 01:24:34,361
Giulia!

625
01:24:52,285 --> 01:24:55,288
If Corrado looks for me,
you can tell him I'm here.

626
01:24:55,288 --> 01:24:58,189
And tell him that my little heart
is racing, racing.

627
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:03,520
And right now this is the only
thing I care about. Clear?

628
01:25:03,763 --> 01:25:04,821
Couldn't be clearer.

629
01:25:08,634 --> 01:25:10,829
What more do I have to do now
to be left alone?

630
01:25:11,137 --> 01:25:13,867
Nothing, you just need to shut
the door, Giulia.

631
01:26:19,839 --> 01:26:22,501
He wasn't at the hotel,
and he probably wasn't in Milazzo, either.

632
01:26:22,942 --> 01:26:24,842
The doorman said he asked
to rent a car.

633
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:28,280
I'm going to change.
See you later. Hi.

634
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,711
We'll try to find him tomorrow
anyway.

635
01:26:37,256 --> 01:26:39,588
He must be in Milazzo
or thereabouts.

636
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:41,425
Shall we go Claudia?

637
01:26:41,894 --> 01:26:42,792
I'm not coming.

638
01:26:43,329 --> 01:26:44,523
Why did you change then?

639
01:26:46,032 --> 01:26:48,660
Get a car to fetch him,
it must be 150 km.

640
01:26:49,468 --> 01:26:51,095
Fine we'll get him,
then.

641
01:26:53,906 --> 01:26:57,103
Giulia is like 0scar Wilde.
Give her all the luxuries

642
01:26:57,276 --> 01:26:59,471
and she will manage without
the little necessities.

643
01:26:59,745 --> 01:27:02,509
That's it, you really cannot do
without quoting those weird names...

644
01:27:02,582 --> 01:27:05,073
He does it even during our
meetings with the administration.

645
01:27:05,151 --> 01:27:07,244
- Who?
- Corrado.

646
01:27:29,141 --> 01:27:31,200
Forgive me but I can't remember
everything that goes on.

647
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:35,237
What do you mean?
You even said she bought a tranquilizer.

648
01:27:35,414 --> 01:27:37,848
It's no use acting as if you
don't remember a thing.

649
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:47,151
<i>A girl answering the description</i>
<i>of the missing person</i>

650
01:27:47,326 --> 01:27:50,352
<i>entered my drug store on the</i>
<i>afternoon of</i>...

651
01:27:51,764 --> 01:27:55,666
She came in and out she went.
With him. But he won't tell you that.

652
01:27:57,203 --> 01:27:58,693
If you think I didn't notice.

653
01:27:59,805 --> 01:28:03,070
Why would I have called the paper
if we had an understanding?

654
01:28:03,476 --> 01:28:05,137
That's what I would like to know.

655
01:28:05,411 --> 01:28:08,403
That makes the two of us. Actually,
three including the gentleman here.

656
01:28:09,482 --> 01:28:11,916
Mrs. Amalia, would you also like to know,
why I called the paper

657
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:14,450
about the missing person that
showed up here two days ago,

658
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:15,518
and disappeared again?

659
01:28:15,688 --> 01:28:17,053
Disappeared?
Who? When?

660
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:19,053
That makes four.
Anyone else?

661
01:28:20,693 --> 01:28:22,524
Listen.
You should be more precise.

662
01:28:22,595 --> 01:28:25,063
That girl, did she or did she not
come into your store?

663
01:28:25,131 --> 01:28:26,291
Yes.

664
01:28:26,999 --> 01:28:28,694
And was she blonde or brunette?

665
01:28:28,768 --> 01:28:31,566
- Brunette.
- Blonde.

666
01:28:33,606 --> 01:28:34,971
What was she wearing?

667
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:37,976
That I don't remember.
Some pale color, I believe.

668
01:28:38,044 --> 01:28:41,946
Him, he doesn't notice the clothing
he notices what's underneath.

669
01:28:42,014 --> 01:28:44,684
Has anyone else inquired
after this girl?

670
01:28:44,684 --> 01:28:46,481
- No... no I don't think so.
- Thank you.

671
01:29:14,213 --> 01:29:15,145
Any news?

672
01:29:15,915 --> 01:29:19,043
Well, plenty of contradictions...
yes, a few clues.

673
01:29:33,532 --> 01:29:36,330
Listen, in the paper they forgot
to mention

674
01:29:36,502 --> 01:29:39,528
that when the girl left,
she took a bus for Noto.

675
01:29:41,841 --> 01:29:43,103
The bus leaves from the square.

676
01:29:44,043 --> 01:29:49,106
I remember because I wanted
to watch her walk way.

677
01:29:50,182 --> 01:29:53,151
Beautiful girl, really.
Beautiful legs.

678
01:29:54,487 --> 01:29:55,317
Do you smoke?

679
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:03,423
You're from Rome,
aren't you?

680
01:30:03,496 --> 01:30:06,056
I knew it.
I'm from Viterbo.

681
01:30:07,466 --> 01:30:09,866
He was doing his military service there,
and you know...

682
01:30:10,603 --> 01:30:12,434
I'm not happy here.

683
01:30:12,838 --> 01:30:14,135
How long have you been married?

684
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:15,570
Three months.

685
01:30:16,742 --> 01:30:17,572
Back inside,
you.

686
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:19,905
Thanks,
thanks a lot for your help.

687
01:30:23,549 --> 01:30:25,983
The very picture of marital bliss.

688
01:30:57,049 --> 01:30:59,313
Tell Lady Patrizia
we'll go on with our search,

689
01:30:59,885 --> 01:31:02,251
and that Miss Claudia will get in
touch one way or the other.

690
01:31:02,555 --> 01:31:03,647
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

691
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,100
What is this place called?

692
01:31:50,169 --> 01:31:50,863
Noto.

693
01:31:54,006 --> 01:31:56,372
And where will we look for Anna?

694
01:31:58,444 --> 01:32:01,379
In a hotel. Apparently, there's only one.
The 'Trinacria'.

695
01:32:16,695 --> 01:32:17,719
Could this be Noto?

696
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:19,154
Let's ask.

697
01:33:33,405 --> 01:33:34,463
Is anybody in?

698
01:33:45,351 --> 01:33:48,684
Hear the echo...
Why is it empty?

699
01:33:49,855 --> 01:33:50,719
Who knows.

700
01:33:53,259 --> 01:33:55,022
I wonder why they built it at all.

701
01:34:05,471 --> 01:34:07,132
There's another one there.

702
01:34:13,112 --> 01:34:15,672
That's not a town.
That's a cemetery.

703
01:34:17,149 --> 01:34:18,810
My God, how dreary.
Let's go.

704
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:20,910
Let's go.

705
01:35:41,166 --> 01:35:42,224
My love...

706
01:35:53,812 --> 01:35:56,781
mine... mine... mine...

707
01:38:01,473 --> 01:38:03,873
Claudia, it's late.
We must go.

708
01:38:39,945 --> 01:38:42,573
Sandro, perhaps it's better
if you were to go alone.

709
01:38:43,448 --> 01:38:44,346
Are you joking?

710
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:48,308
Don't think I'm trying to get away
with the awkwardness,

711
01:38:49,087 --> 01:38:50,554
the difficulty this meeting might
cause.

712
01:38:51,089 --> 01:38:51,987
That's not it,

713
01:38:53,292 --> 01:38:55,624
it's just that these things
can be discussed

714
01:38:55,694 --> 01:38:58,356
more easily without my being
present.

715
01:38:58,897 --> 01:39:00,865
Try to understand my position.

716
01:39:00,999 --> 01:39:05,459
It might seem as if I were trying to
influence you, twist your arm.

717
01:39:06,405 --> 01:39:08,396
And it makes me uneasy.

718
01:41:10,195 --> 01:41:11,355
What can I do for you, Miss?

719
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:13,964
- I'd like a can of paint.
- Which color?

720
01:41:14,132 --> 01:41:15,599
- Navy blue.
- Right away.

721
01:41:23,175 --> 01:41:25,735
Claudia.
What's happening?

722
01:41:27,579 --> 01:41:30,639
0h, Sandro, I'm so ashamed...
so ashamed. Did you see that?

723
01:41:31,316 --> 01:41:35,343
I was trying to hide. I feel so measly.
I hate myself.

724
01:41:35,854 --> 01:41:36,980
Does it make you feel better
talking this way?

725
01:41:37,155 --> 01:41:38,315
No.

726
01:41:38,724 --> 01:41:39,850
So why do you do it?

727
01:41:40,192 --> 01:41:41,750
Because what I'm doing is ugly.

728
01:41:42,194 --> 01:41:44,162
Because if you were to tell me
right now 'Claudia I love you',

729
01:41:44,996 --> 01:41:46,054
I'd believe you.

730
01:41:46,765 --> 01:41:47,891
I'd believe you.

731
01:41:49,334 --> 01:41:49,766
Claudia...

732
01:41:49,935 --> 01:41:52,802
No, don't say anything or
I would make you swear

733
01:41:53,405 --> 01:41:55,236
and tell me so many things...

734
01:41:55,874 --> 01:41:57,842
And it's not right...
it cannot be right.

735
01:41:59,177 --> 01:42:00,144
It's absurd.

736
01:42:00,312 --> 01:42:01,506
Great. And all the better
if it is absurd.

737
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,911
It means we can't do anything about it.
Do you understand me?

738
01:42:08,453 --> 01:42:10,683
I'm sorry,
but we don't need it anymore.

739
01:42:10,856 --> 01:42:11,788
0h, that's all right -
don't worry.

740
01:42:11,957 --> 01:42:13,049
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

741
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:25,360
To think that you must have told
Anna these same things

742
01:42:25,437 --> 01:42:27,029
I don't know how many times...

743
01:42:27,105 --> 01:42:31,064
Let's say I did: I was in earnest
with her as I am now with you.

744
01:42:35,947 --> 01:42:39,542
I've never met a woman like you
who needs to see everything clearly.

745
01:42:40,152 --> 01:42:41,141
Come,
let's take a walk.

746
01:42:47,058 --> 01:42:48,423
Up here it really is beautiful.

747
01:42:50,796 --> 01:42:52,525
Imagine,
I have never been up here.

748
01:42:55,233 --> 01:42:56,962
Please feel free to stay.
I'm going back down.

749
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,818
Such imagination.
Such movement.

750
01:43:20,492 --> 01:43:22,585
They were concerned with the
architectural settings.

751
01:43:24,362 --> 01:43:25,795
Such extraordinary freedom.

752
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:34,637
I really must go ahead
and leave Ettore.

753
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:36,498
I'd like to work on design again.

754
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:41,768
- I used to have ideas of my own, you know.
- Why did you stop?

755
01:43:42,314 --> 01:43:43,838
Why,
why, why?

756
01:43:46,218 --> 01:43:49,415
Because it isn't easy to admit that
a red floor suits a certain room,

757
01:43:50,355 --> 01:43:51,822
when you're thinking exactly
the opposite.

758
01:43:52,224 --> 01:43:53,384
But the lady wants it red.

759
01:43:53,758 --> 01:43:57,057
Because there is always a lady...
or a man... and so...

760
01:43:58,363 --> 01:44:03,164
0nce, I was asked to make the estimate
for the construction of a school.

761
01:44:04,035 --> 01:44:05,627
It took me a day and a half.

762
01:44:06,338 --> 01:44:07,430
I earned four million lira.

763
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:15,541
So I went on giving estimates
of other people's projects.

764
01:44:18,583 --> 01:44:20,448
Why are you looking at me
this way?

765
01:44:20,518 --> 01:44:23,715
Because I am convinced you could
make really beautiful things.

766
01:44:24,222 --> 01:44:26,713
I don't know,
I really don't know about that.

767
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:31,790
Who needs beautiful things nowadays
Claudia. How long will they last?

768
01:44:34,866 --> 01:44:37,562
All of this was built
to last centuries.

769
01:44:37,636 --> 01:44:41,732
Today, ten, twenty years at the most,
and then? Well...

770
01:45:06,097 --> 01:45:06,791
Claudia,

771
01:45:09,901 --> 01:45:11,368
shall we get married?

772
01:45:11,436 --> 01:45:13,131
What do you mean,
shall we get married?

773
01:45:13,204 --> 01:45:15,331
Let's get married,
you and I.

774
01:45:17,242 --> 01:45:17,765
Answer me.

775
01:45:18,343 --> 01:45:19,037
Answer.

776
01:45:20,378 --> 01:45:21,174
How should I answer?

777
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,105
No.

778
01:45:24,582 --> 01:45:26,015
Not now, anyway...
I don't know...

779
01:45:26,851 --> 01:45:27,840
I wasn't even thinking about it.

780
01:45:28,887 --> 01:45:31,617
At a time like this...
But why are you asking me?

781
01:45:33,224 --> 01:45:36,216
You're looking at me as though
I'd said something crazy.

782
01:45:37,762 --> 01:45:41,664
Are you sure you want to marry me?
Really sure?

783
01:45:44,536 --> 01:45:46,731
That you want to marry me?

784
01:45:47,072 --> 01:45:48,801
Am I not asking you?

785
01:45:53,778 --> 01:45:55,939
Why aren't things less complicated.

786
01:45:57,749 --> 01:45:59,808
You say
that I'd like to see things clearly.

787
01:46:00,785 --> 01:46:05,051
I'd like to see things clearly

788
01:46:07,759 --> 01:46:08,726
and instead...

789
01:46:21,206 --> 01:46:22,400
They're answering,
hear them?

790
01:46:22,574 --> 01:46:23,131
Where from?

791
01:46:34,285 --> 01:46:35,149
From that tower over there.

792
01:47:30,241 --> 01:47:35,178
<i>No</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>of you I will never let go</i>

793
01:47:36,181 --> 01:47:40,845
<i>no</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>forever you'll be mine</i>...

794
01:47:41,019 --> 01:47:41,815
Are you ready?

795
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:43,182
Yes.

796
01:47:44,522 --> 01:47:46,456
Why have I fallen in love
with you so?

797
01:47:47,092 --> 01:47:48,320
Come,
come quickly.

798
01:47:48,793 --> 01:47:51,591
Yes, yes... Where is it,
where is it... yes.

799
01:47:52,063 --> 01:47:56,796
<i>Yes</i>, <i>yes</i>,
<i>I will always hate you</i>

800
01:47:57,235 --> 01:48:02,002
<i>No</i>, <i>no</i>,
<i>of you I will never let go</i>

801
01:48:02,373 --> 01:48:05,103
<i>The sweetest pining I will feel</i>

802
01:48:05,276 --> 01:48:07,506
Ciao,
see you later.

803
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,739
<i>My kisses</i>
<i>shall get you back to me</i>...

804
01:48:10,915 --> 01:48:14,749
No, no, you can't leave me
in a hotel room alone.

805
01:48:18,756 --> 01:48:21,884
Come down, when you're ready.
I'll be downstairs or in the piazza.

806
01:48:23,461 --> 01:48:26,794
Fine. But first you must tell me
that going out without me

807
01:48:27,031 --> 01:48:28,396
is like missing a limb.

808
01:48:29,634 --> 01:48:33,502
Go ahead and visit the city all alone,
you'll limp.

809
01:48:34,739 --> 01:48:37,799
Tell me you want to embrace my
shadow running along the walls.

810
01:48:55,493 --> 01:48:56,619
And then you must tell me...

811
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:13,136
...you must tell me you love me.

812
01:49:17,615 --> 01:49:19,082
You know.
Why should I tell you?

813
01:49:24,789 --> 01:49:25,483
That's right.

814
01:49:29,928 --> 01:49:30,656
Why?

815
01:49:33,865 --> 01:49:34,797
I'll see you later.

816
01:50:45,837 --> 01:50:47,964
Excuse me,
excuse me.

817
01:50:49,574 --> 01:50:53,408
Is anyone in charge of this place?
A guard? A curator?

818
01:50:53,845 --> 01:50:54,937
He must be in the church.

819
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:57,471
- Any museums around here?
- What do I know.

820
01:50:57,915 --> 01:51:01,146
It says from 9:30 to 12:30.
It's ten now.

821
01:51:02,153 --> 01:51:05,611
- Fine way of welcoming tourists.
- Tourists. What tourists?

822
01:51:06,491 --> 01:51:08,425
Last year we got a few French,

823
01:51:08,793 --> 01:51:10,784
they went to the beach to swim
with the 'jeep'.

824
01:51:11,396 --> 01:51:13,057
- With what?
- With a 'jeep'.

825
01:51:14,232 --> 01:51:17,099
With the bikinis!
And so?

826
01:51:17,669 --> 01:51:20,638
We let them know that they'd
better move on, leave...

827
01:52:10,755 --> 01:52:11,847
I'm sorry,
I didn't...

828
01:52:12,824 --> 01:52:13,813
You did it deliberately.

829
01:52:14,192 --> 01:52:17,628
Deliberately? Why would I?
No! Really.

830
01:52:18,463 --> 01:52:19,293
Don't!

831
01:52:27,739 --> 01:52:29,229
- How old are you?
- Twenty-three.

832
01:52:30,775 --> 01:52:32,037
Twenty-three.

833
01:52:38,082 --> 01:52:39,481
I have been twenty-three too,

834
01:52:40,485 --> 01:52:42,817
and I was in so many fights
you can't even imagine.

835
01:53:30,401 --> 01:53:32,301
Play, play...

836
01:53:35,139 --> 01:53:40,099
Forgive me, Miss, if I interfere...
but I've heard...

837
01:53:40,478 --> 01:53:42,002
Here news get around...

838
01:53:42,346 --> 01:53:44,610
That girl you're looking for.

839
01:53:44,782 --> 01:53:47,080
Why don't you look for her at the
youth hostel in Pergusa?

840
01:53:47,518 --> 01:53:51,511
Almost all of the girls from out
of town end up staying there.

841
01:53:54,192 --> 01:53:57,389
I was coming down to join you.
Why back so soon? Shall we go?

842
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:02,063
Sandro,
what's wrong?

843
01:54:02,433 --> 01:54:03,661
Nothing,
forgive me.

844
01:55:19,343 --> 01:55:21,573
- No Sandro, please.
- Why not?

845
01:55:21,746 --> 01:55:22,371
I don't know why.

846
01:55:23,981 --> 01:55:24,675
What's gotten into you?

847
01:55:27,552 --> 01:55:29,520
Wait a moment, please.
Just a moment.

848
01:55:31,455 --> 01:55:33,787
I feel as though I don't know you.

849
01:55:34,292 --> 01:55:36,954
Aren't you happy?
You get to have a new fling!

850
01:55:37,929 --> 01:55:38,896
What are you saying?

851
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:43,291
I was joking, c'mon.
I can never joke with you.

852
01:55:49,607 --> 01:55:52,599
Now, though, you gotta tell me
why you don't want to.

853
01:55:58,549 --> 01:56:03,486
0h, Sandro!
I want all that you want, but...

854
01:56:04,488 --> 01:56:05,250
But?

855
01:56:19,437 --> 01:56:22,634
Did the landlady tell you about
this hostel near by?

856
01:56:23,441 --> 01:56:27,901
Yes, she started to,
but I didn't feel like listening to her.

857
01:56:28,212 --> 01:56:30,009
If we were to listen
to all the rumors...

858
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:32,913
Yes, it's true,
but...

859
01:56:37,755 --> 01:56:41,555
We haven't been in touch with anybody,
not even Anna's father.

860
01:56:42,326 --> 01:56:44,089
We should have phoned,
sent a cable...

861
01:56:45,463 --> 01:56:47,192
Let's be fair,
he must be feeling very lonely...

862
01:56:47,565 --> 01:56:48,964
Right,
I don't doubt that for a moment,

863
01:56:49,133 --> 01:56:51,761
but we are the last two people
that should be near him right now.

864
01:56:52,837 --> 01:56:55,931
And then, phone... where?
Where is he?

865
01:56:56,841 --> 01:56:59,571
As you wish...
let's leave here though.

866
01:57:00,378 --> 01:57:01,572
Go pack your bag.

867
01:57:34,278 --> 01:57:34,903
Good evening.

868
01:57:36,914 --> 01:57:37,972
Good evening.

869
01:57:39,316 --> 01:57:40,783
- Show them to the reception desk.
- Thank you.

870
01:57:40,985 --> 01:57:42,009
- You're welcome.
- Wait for me.

871
01:57:52,797 --> 01:57:53,559
Marquise.

872
01:57:58,269 --> 01:58:01,261
Concierge,
who is that little doll?

873
01:58:01,706 --> 01:58:02,764
She just came in,
I wouldn't know.

874
01:58:10,815 --> 01:58:13,511
Claudia,
Claudia.

875
01:58:17,788 --> 01:58:20,018
I'm looking for the others
and here I find you.

876
01:58:20,191 --> 01:58:20,987
How are you?

877
01:58:40,845 --> 01:58:42,813
Could we find a quieter spot?

878
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:43,969
Quieter?

879
01:58:45,216 --> 01:58:46,274
Yes,
of course.

880
01:59:29,927 --> 01:59:30,894
You seem well.

881
01:59:37,535 --> 01:59:38,331
Here's Sandro.

882
01:59:44,909 --> 01:59:46,308
Why don't you go up and change.

883
02:00:02,893 --> 02:00:04,588
Did you get a good room?

884
02:00:04,762 --> 02:00:05,786
Not really,
apparently.

885
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:07,522
You should have told Ettore.

886
02:00:07,698 --> 02:00:09,188
He always manages to get
what he wants.

887
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:11,294
Is Ettore still angry with me?

888
02:00:11,535 --> 02:00:12,866
0f course not.

889
02:00:13,237 --> 02:00:15,000
And then you know,
he would forgive you anything,

890
02:00:15,372 --> 02:00:17,670
as long as you admit that
he's the better driver.

891
02:00:21,912 --> 02:00:23,903
How can you wander through
this bedlam?

892
02:00:24,081 --> 02:00:25,946
You've always said people
irritate you.

893
02:00:26,116 --> 02:00:29,608
You mustn't always take me literally.
I'm really quite used to it.

894
02:00:30,187 --> 02:00:33,054
First my mother, then my husband.
Both full of energies.

895
02:00:33,991 --> 02:00:36,050
- Your mother?
- Yes, I too had a mother.

896
02:00:36,527 --> 02:00:39,758
With a touch of Austrian blood in her,
but I had one.

897
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:42,924
My childhood was like a merry-go-round:
now here, now there.

898
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,491
Mine instead was a very
sensible one.

899
02:00:45,569 --> 02:00:46,968
What do you mean
'sensible'?

900
02:00:47,037 --> 02:00:48,732
It means without any money.

901
02:01:02,086 --> 02:01:02,848
Til later then.

902
02:01:03,621 --> 02:01:04,280
Til later.

903
02:01:22,907 --> 02:01:23,532
Please.

904
02:01:26,677 --> 02:01:27,507
Come in.

905
02:01:29,947 --> 02:01:30,879
You may leave them drawn.

906
02:01:31,982 --> 02:01:33,347
As you wish,
madam.

907
02:01:38,222 --> 02:01:39,416
Would you like anything else?

908
02:01:39,590 --> 02:01:40,579
- Nothing.
- Pardon me.

909
02:01:45,362 --> 02:01:46,386
Thank you,
thank you.

910
02:01:46,931 --> 02:01:48,694
- Everything all right? Good night.
- Evening.

911
02:01:51,835 --> 02:01:54,099
They might as well have used
a machine.

912
02:01:54,605 --> 02:01:55,230
Come in...

913
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:01,478
Please, put this one over here.
And that there.

914
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:10,652
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

915
02:02:38,816 --> 02:02:39,578
Listen.

916
02:02:45,255 --> 02:02:47,280
Try not to get too involved
tomorrow.

917
02:02:50,427 --> 02:02:51,223
Aren't you going to change?

918
02:02:52,229 --> 02:02:54,595
But didn't you say you wanted
to let your job with Ettore go?

919
02:02:56,533 --> 02:02:58,000
Yes, yes,
that's what I said.

920
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:07,308
It's freezing.

921
02:03:08,712 --> 02:03:09,679
Sandro.

922
02:03:09,847 --> 02:03:10,575
Yes.

923
02:03:11,849 --> 02:03:12,975
I'm not coming down.

924
02:03:13,550 --> 02:03:14,141
Why not?

925
02:03:15,352 --> 02:03:16,182
I'm too sleepy.

926
02:03:17,121 --> 02:03:18,645
You must learn to shake sleep off.

927
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:20,979
Have you learned?

928
02:03:21,392 --> 02:03:23,690
0f course,
I learned as a boy.

929
02:03:24,361 --> 02:03:27,194
I never slept, and I had friends
that slept even less.

930
02:03:29,933 --> 02:03:32,629
Whoever went to bed first
had to pay a fine.

931
02:03:33,137 --> 02:03:38,131
We didn't do anything wrong,
but once the movies were over,

932
02:03:38,308 --> 02:03:41,744
we'd go to a café and talk,
then we'd sit on a bench

933
02:03:42,379 --> 02:03:47,146
and listen to a drunkard,
we'd watch the billboards go up,

934
02:03:49,753 --> 02:03:53,086
or the sheep go by,
we'd run to the general markets...

935
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:55,483
0r we'd wake up other friends

936
02:03:55,559 --> 02:03:58,460
or a girl by calling under
her windows.

937
02:04:30,527 --> 02:04:31,585
Say,
are you really so sleepy?

938
02:04:34,531 --> 02:04:36,795
What time are you getting up
tomorrow morning?

939
02:04:36,867 --> 02:04:37,697
Late.

940
02:04:38,469 --> 02:04:39,026
Late?

941
02:04:39,203 --> 02:04:40,192
Very late.

942
02:05:17,307 --> 02:05:20,242
Do you know that as a boy
I wanted to be a diplomat?

943
02:05:20,477 --> 02:05:21,842
Can you imagine,
me a diplomat?

944
02:05:25,182 --> 02:05:27,878
It's strange but I never thought
I might get rich.

945
02:05:29,153 --> 02:05:32,919
I saw myself in a rented room...
a man of genius.

946
02:05:35,526 --> 02:05:38,154
Instead, I have two houses, one in Rome,
another in Milan.

947
02:05:38,228 --> 02:05:41,595
As for genius,
it's a bad habit I never caught.

948
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:44,262
What do you think?

949
02:05:47,538 --> 02:05:48,732
I see it differently.

950
02:05:50,073 --> 02:05:53,133
However, it's better if we continue
this conversation another time.

951
02:05:53,210 --> 02:05:55,508
Do you mind switching out
that light there?

952
02:06:18,569 --> 02:06:20,127
Good night,
love.

953
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:24,468
Tell me you love me.

954
02:06:28,645 --> 02:06:29,270
I love you.

955
02:06:29,846 --> 02:06:30,835
Tell me again.

956
02:06:33,617 --> 02:06:34,311
I don't love you.

957
02:06:37,988 --> 02:06:38,818
I deserve that.

958
02:07:01,345 --> 02:07:03,575
It's not true.
I love you.

959
02:08:26,863 --> 02:08:27,295
At the bar.

960
02:08:27,464 --> 02:08:28,624
Ask him to come here.

961
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:34,564
Ettore.

962
02:08:35,372 --> 02:08:36,134
Finally!

963
02:08:36,673 --> 02:08:37,162
How are you?

964
02:08:37,341 --> 02:08:38,603
Come,
I'll introduce you to some friends.

965
02:08:38,975 --> 02:08:40,306
Yes, I'll take a look around
and then I'll join you.

966
02:08:40,610 --> 02:08:44,444
Say. From tomorrow morning
you're back at my disposal, clear?

967
02:08:44,781 --> 02:08:46,578
If you don't give me some figures,
how can I go on?

968
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:48,217
See you.

969
02:12:33,610 --> 02:12:43,042
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

970
02:12:55,065 --> 02:13:01,300
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

971
02:14:19,449 --> 02:14:21,883
Patrizia. Patrizia.

972
02:14:26,823 --> 02:14:27,551
Where is Ettore?

973
02:14:28,224 --> 02:14:29,384
He must be asleep.

974
02:14:29,726 --> 02:14:30,920
Would you see if Sandro
is with him?

975
02:14:31,294 --> 02:14:33,387
He's not in his room...
Forgive me, but -

976
02:14:48,278 --> 02:14:48,937
Ettore.

977
02:14:49,112 --> 02:14:49,976
What is it?

978
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:51,838
I was looking for Sandro.

979
02:14:52,282 --> 02:14:54,443
And you look for him here?
Ask Claudia.

980
02:14:54,684 --> 02:14:55,651
But of course.

981
02:15:04,994 --> 02:15:05,858
Patrizia,
I'm afraid.

982
02:15:06,663 --> 02:15:08,995
You're telling me!
I have nightmares at night.

983
02:15:09,532 --> 02:15:12,000
No.
I'm afraid Anna has come back.

984
02:15:12,836 --> 02:15:15,566
I can feel it,
that they're together.

985
02:15:16,172 --> 02:15:18,436
What has gotten into you?
We would have had word.

986
02:15:19,309 --> 02:15:21,334
Sandro must be in the garden
getting some fresh air,

987
02:15:21,978 --> 02:15:22,967
watching the sun rise.

988
02:15:24,347 --> 02:15:27,407
It would be amusing to find out
he's really a sentimentalist.

989
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:32,213
Listen, try not to dwell on that idea,
please...

990
02:15:33,223 --> 02:15:34,121
Go and get some sleep.

991
02:15:36,059 --> 02:15:39,460
0nly a few days ago, only at the thought
that Anna might be dead,

992
02:15:39,529 --> 02:15:41,429
I felt I could have died too.

993
02:15:42,699 --> 02:15:46,601
Now I won't even cry.
I am afraid she might be alive!

994
02:15:49,472 --> 02:15:51,531
Everything is becoming
so hideously simple.

995
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:55,605
Even to get rid of a pain.

996
02:16:00,683 --> 02:16:03,117
0ne should never wish to fall into
melodramatic undertones.

997
02:16:06,322 --> 02:16:09,621
You're right.
Why should I cry?

998
02:16:11,761 --> 02:16:13,126
I'm tired of being this way.

999
02:18:10,914 --> 02:18:11,938
Dear.

1000
02:18:16,052 --> 02:18:18,384
Won't you leave me a souvenir.

1001
02:18:20,390 --> 02:18:22,324
Just a small souvenir.
