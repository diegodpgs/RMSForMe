1
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,990
<i>Do you know what prime numbers are?</i>

2
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,357
<i>Because if you don't,</i>
<i>you should just leave now.</i>

3
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,753
In 1742, the mathematician
Christian Goldbach

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,394
observed that even numbers
could be expressed

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,716
as the sum of two prime numbers.

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,312
It's easy to see
with small numbers.

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,835
18, an even number,
is 7 + 11,

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,955
which are prime.

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,032
24 is 5 + 19,
which are prime.

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,959
50 is 13 + 37, and so on.

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,628
Say an even number.

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,555
100.

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,475
1,000.

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,036
100 is 83 + 17.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,315
And 1,000

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,432
is 521 + 479.

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,233
It works with
much larger numbers too.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,032
Let's see, any number...

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,514
7,112.

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,398
7,112

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,835
is

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,912
5,119 +

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,839
1,993.

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,079
Both prime numbers.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,190
But you can't check it
with all even numbers

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,952
because numbers are infinite.

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,236
A law had to be found
that would cover them all.

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,516
And finding it became
the most difficult problem

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,392
in the History of Mathematics.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,908
Will you sign this?

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,749
Yes, of course.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,593
- Your name?
- Inés.

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,509
For Inés.

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,273
- Here you are, Inés.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,999
- And good luck!
- Thanks.

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,032
Why "good luck"?

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,670
On February 20 I'm presenting
my demonstration

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,638
of Goldbach's Conjecture.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,755
Come up!
Hurry!

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,919
Your demonstration's ruined.

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,070
Fuck!

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,157
- What'll you do?
- I can repeat it, but I need time.

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,598
I don't know how they got in
without being heard.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,270
FERMAT'S ROOM

45
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,239
FOUR MONTHS LATER

46
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,756
You like puzzles, don't you?

47
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,792
See if you can answer this.

48
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,148
What is the link

49
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,154
between Georg Cantor,
Yutaka Taniyama and Kurt Gödel?

50
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,714
Let's see.

51
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,551
The three were mathematicians.

52
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,152
- The three went down in History...
- And the three went mad.

53
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,759
Kurt Gödel formulated
the Theorem of Incompleteness.

54
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,513
Kurt Gödel
committed suicide.

55
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,318
I was very tempted to commit suicide
a few days ago.

56
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,592
But I remembered
we had this game,

57
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,399
something that you forget
very often.

58
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,633
You can't go on like this.

59
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,994
You have to get out.

60
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,633
I'm speaking as a doctor,
not as a friend.

61
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,592
You tell me three times a day.

62
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,437
Three!

63
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,392
I'm speaking as a mathematician,
not as a friend.

64
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,076
In fact, I'm going to go away.

65
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,873
Want to see what I got
in the mail today?

66
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,394
Rook F

67
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,235
to E 8.

68
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,636
You'll see.

69
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,997
"If you are capable of solving
the following puzzle,

70
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,110
which I don't doubt,

71
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,834
you will be invited
to a weekend gathering

72
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,033
with the most ingenious
mathematical minds.

73
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,593
Sincerely,

74
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,515
Fermat."

75
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,795
What's the puzzle?

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,910
It's

77
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,159
a sequence of numbers.
You have to find the pattern.

78
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,634
I've got ten days,

79
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,194
but it isn't easy.

80
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,234
TEN DAYS LATER

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,751
...8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 7...

82
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,516
Well?

83
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,872
Have you solved the problem?

84
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,955
No, I haven't.

85
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,034
And this was the last day.

86
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,513
If you want to stay late,
I'll leave you the key.

87
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,717
Drop it in the mailbox afterwards.

88
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,276
Thanks.

89
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,670
One thing.

90
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,036
Put back any books you use
in alphabetical order.

91
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,871
Eight, five, four...

92
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,111
They're in alphabetical order!

93
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,593
Their alphabetical order!

94
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,709
<i>Dear Sir,</i>

95
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,559
<i>Only you and three other people</i>
<i>were able to resolve the puzzle.</i>

96
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,152
<i>As I said in my last letter,</i>

97
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,799
<i>the mathematical society</i>
<i>I preside over</i>

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,228
<i>would value your presence</i>

99
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,790
<i>at one of the meetings we arrange</i>
<i>to exchange knowledge.</i>

100
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,030
<i>I hope you weren't offended</i>
<i>by the test.</i>

101
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,038
<i>Now I know I can trust you.</i>

102
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,319
<i>If you trust me,</i>
<i>follow my directions.</i>

103
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,873
<i>On Friday, July 25, at 19:00,</i>
<i>come to the meeting point.</i>

104
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,710
<i>Take Highway 141 to Km. 18.</i>

105
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,078
<i>Take the turn-off</i>
<i>and continue to the end.</i>

106
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,599
<i>Remember I am relying on you</i>

107
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,916
<i>to put to you</i>
<i>what I believe to be</i>

108
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,839
<i>the most ingenious,</i>
<i>unedited enigma ever set out.</i>

109
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,473
<i>Do not bring a cell phone.</i>

110
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,873
<i>Give no information about</i>
<i>your identity to the other guests.</i>

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,359
<i>Your pseudonym during</i>
<i>the gathering</i>

112
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,198
<i>will be Pascal.</i>

113
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,559
<i>Sincerely, Fermat.</i>

114
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,348
I'm sorry,
I've broken down here.

115
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,792
It happens with old cars.

116
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,069
Mr. Hilbert.

117
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,953
- We're going to the same place!
- Yes. What a coincidence.

118
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,432
The more you study logic,

119
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,837
the more you value coincidence.

120
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,997
Do you know whose phrase that is?

121
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,910
No.

122
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,716
Mine!

123
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,189
Hello.

124
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,950
Are you going
to the mysterious gathering?

125
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,798
According to my invitation,

126
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,633
I should call myself

127
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,430
Oliva.

128
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,156
That'll be for Oliva Sabuco, right?

129
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,712
The 16th century scientist.

130
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,148
I'm an inventor.

131
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,350
Have you invented anything
I might have used?

132
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,316
I don't know.

133
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,475
Lots of things,
from huge hydraulic presses to...

134
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,438
Look, things like this.

135
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,274
You'll like this.

136
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,350
This is...

137
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,028
Well, you put the corn in here

138
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,950
and then

139
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,112
the popcorn
comes out of his mouth.

140
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,196
A duck.

141
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,959
Why the nicknames?

142
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,996
Well,

143
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,918
in theory because what matters
at these meetings are the ideas,

144
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,269
not the people.

145
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,199
That's nice.

146
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,672
I'm sick of people saying I'm right
because of who I am.

147
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,276
Yes, it's best
if we don't know each other.

148
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,879
But I do know you.

149
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,917
I saw your photo in a magazine.

150
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,034
It said that you'd resolved

151
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,157
Goldbach's Conjecture.

152
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,750
Is it true?

153
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,671
If it is,
it's best if no one knows.

154
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,593
You'd all say I was right,
just because of who I am.

155
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,509
Hi, there!

156
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,919
We're all here now.

157
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,758
We weren't supposed
to know each other.

158
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,319
And we don't.

159
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,748
Mr. Galois picked me up on the road.

160
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,836
It's 19:00.

161
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,715
Now what?

162
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,871
To be precise,
there's half a minute to go.

163
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,798
I suppose they'll come and get us.

164
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,233
You've done this before?

165
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,037
Yes.

166
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,992
There are always games and things.

167
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,111
I bet they'll pick us up

168
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,348
in a luxury car.

169
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,756
Whoever is coming
won't be punctual.

170
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,752
In 5 seconds it'll be 19:00.

171
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,116
Well, 3 seconds,

172
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,639
2, 1...

173
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,916
Lights!

174
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,154
I think you've just found
the luxury car.

175
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,392
PYTHAGORAS

176
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,076
Well,

177
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,552
this reminds me of the riddle
about the shepherd

178
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,835
who has to cross
the river in a boat

179
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,076
with a sheep, a wolf
and a cabbage.

180
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,390
You know it?

181
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,839
Only two can go
in the boat.

182
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,350
For example,
the shepherd and the sheep.

183
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,114
Or the shepherd
and the cabbage.

184
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,515
You have to work out
how he can cross the river

185
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,309
without the wolf eating the sheep
or the sheep eating the cabbage.

186
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,593
Why would a shepherd
bring a wolf?

187
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,916
What's more,

188
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,510
I don't see what it has to do
with this situation.

189
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,831
Perhaps Professor Hilbert meant
that one of us is the shepherd,

190
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,156
another, the wolf;
another, the sheep

191
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,118
and another, the cabbage.

192
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,074
They connected the car's system
to a PDA.

193
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,195
They probably programmed it
to switch on the lights at 19:00.

194
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,236
Now what?
Where do we go?

195
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,999
We're here,

196
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,993
and we have to drive to there.

197
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,511
We have to go in here.

198
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,077
Here?

199
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,917
In a grain store?

200
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,152
I've certainly seen

201
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,515
more stylish chicken farms.

202
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,670
The usual place for
these gatherings would be

203
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,871
an elegant drawing room.

204
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,309
A library

205
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,592
filled with
books on mathematics,

206
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,398
a blackboard
for doing calculations,

207
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,678
a nice couch, armchairs,

208
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,878
a tea table...

209
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,276
So,

210
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,439
anything missing?

211
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,989
Well,

212
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,718
at first sight,

213
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,035
Mr. Fermat is missing.

214
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,274
What time is it?

215
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,519
21:50.

216
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,471
Anyone know anything
about our host?

217
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,199
I only know
that I know nothing.

218
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,479
We can't know anything.

219
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,035
I know something.

220
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,034
I checked up and I discovered
a few things about Fermat.

221
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,753
Shall I tell you?

222
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,993
That's against the rules.
I'd rather not know.

223
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,429
True,

224
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,149
but now that one of us has got
more information than the others,

225
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,279
isn't it best to share it,
so we're all on the same level?

226
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,989
OK.

227
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,356
A month ago,

228
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,317
we had to send the solution

229
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,833
to Fermat's P.O. Box.

230
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,956
P.O. Box 325.

231
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,270
Well,

232
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,471
I looked for the name
of the owner of 325.

233
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,913
To discover Fermat's real name.

234
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,753
The Post Office can't
tell you that. It's confidential.

235
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,154
It is, in theory.

236
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,794
I went to the Post Office
and said I was president

237
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,712
of "Defend the Brown Bear".

238
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,559
I said there were only 325
brown bears left in our mountains

239
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,640
and we wanted that P.O. Box
as a symbolic number.

240
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,430
The employee said
that the number had been taken.

241
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,917
I insisted on how important
the number was for us

242
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,552
and how 325 brown bears
would be very grateful.

243
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,235
And he gave you the name
of the P.O. Box owner?

244
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,153
And a donation for the bears.

245
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,038
Yes, he gave me Fermat's name.

246
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,714
I looked on the Internet,
and here's the good part.

247
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,479
There isn't one file in his name.

248
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,388
Nothing.

249
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,030
Right.

250
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,589
That's all?

251
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,713
Congratulations, you've discovered
that you've discovered nothing.

252
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,355
At least,

253
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,436
what is Fermat's name?

254
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,631
Yes,

255
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,476
it was

256
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,993
something with F, like...

257
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,593
Fran, no, Fer...

258
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,830
Wait, wait.

259
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,319
A bit slower.

260
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,273
We can't process
so much information at once.

261
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,716
You discovered something else.

262
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,954
Good evening.

263
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,078
Forgive me for being late.

264
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,879
I'm Fermat.

265
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,953
It's worth waiting
if the enigma is really original.

266
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,988
- The enigma you're talking about...
- Well,

267
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,470
there's no hurry.

268
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,270
We can sit down first
and take things calmly.

269
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,310
No, no.

270
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,193
The greatest enigma
ever set out is:

271
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,713
how is it that four people
are in here together

272
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,071
and still haven't
touched the supper?

273
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,470
The last gathering of this kind
that I attended

274
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,119
was about this.

275
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,068
Oranges?

276
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,270
No, Kepler's old problem about
how to pile up spherical forms.

277
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,158
It's still unsolved, isn't it?

278
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,994
The fact is, mathematicians
worry about stupidities

279
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,513
with no practical application.

280
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,475
It's not stupid to be famous
for solving a problem.

281
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,512
It should be
any mathematician's dream.

282
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,478
Then I'm not any mathematician.

283
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,315
I read a study recently
about the human being's

284
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,277
most common
impossible wishes:

285
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,870
to fly and to be invisible,
not to resolve mathematical enigmas.

286
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,593
What do you think?

287
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,718
I'd prefer to fly.

288
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,154
Why?

289
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,753
I don't know,

290
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,592
to fly,

291
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,673
to see places,

292
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,638
to enjoy it.

293
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,392
I'd ask to fly too.

294
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,470
But if we could all fly
it wouldn't be special.

295
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,591
It's special
if only you can do it.

296
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,189
I think flying is overrated.

297
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,358
I think it's much more practical

298
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,919
to be invisible.

299
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,235
For what?

300
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,238
To see without being seen.

301
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,034
I think being invisible
is only useful for doing harm.

302
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,034
What would a person want to do
if he were invisible?

303
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,310
Go into the girls' changing rooms,

304
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,109
steal tips in bars,
go to Mass naked.

305
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,594
Nothing good.

306
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,159
When we do something good,

307
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,719
we like to be seen.

308
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,751
Yes, but if

309
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,229
I were invisible
I'd use it

310
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,358
to do good for all of Humanity
without being seen.

311
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,237
And no one would have to thank me.

312
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,876
When is this guy going to tell us
the damn enigma?

313
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,870
Well,

314
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,439
I guess that

315
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,949
we'll start now
with the greatest enigma.

316
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,236
I don't know.
I guess so.

317
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,159
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

318
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,755
Yes?

319
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,308
When you investigated Fermat

320
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,115
and got so much information,

321
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,595
do you remember
if he was a murderer?

322
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,319
- Why would he be?
- Come on!

323
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,909
Because of the five of us
who are here,

324
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,873
he's the only one
with a cell!

325
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,796
Get it? A cell!

326
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,473
It's not funny.

327
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,596
I think I have to leave.

328
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,433
Is anything wrong?

329
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,239
I think that was the hospital,
but I couldn't hear well.

330
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,638
And then I was cut off.

331
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,797
What's happening at the hospital?

332
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,033
My daughter is there.
She's in a coma.

333
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,709
In that case, it may be good news.

334
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,556
Or it may be bad.

335
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,560
Maybe they just need
some information,

336
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,154
and I'll be back in an hour.

337
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,276
You'd better carry on without me.

338
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,038
I know what you're thinking.

339
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,068
All this is too weird.

340
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,071
Fermat forgot his jacket.

341
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,789
Fermat!

342
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,311
Fermat! Your jacket!

343
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,149
Fermat! Your jacket!

344
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,315
All right!

345
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,075
Well,

346
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,112
let's see what we'll do

347
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,316
now that we're alone!

348
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,511
Where's Pascal?

349
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,399
Fermat's jacket!

350
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,713
Of course!

351
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,508
Let's see.

352
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,108
Román...

353
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,994
Román...

354
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,230
Román...

355
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,194
Fermat is called
Román Naranjo López.

356
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,035
Sound familiar?

357
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,668
Román Naranjo...
I've never heard of him.

358
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,558
I don't know any Román.

359
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,991
The P.O. Box I checked out
wasn't in that name.

360
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,838
It was like...

361
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,875
It was Fermín de la Vega,
or De la Cuadra...

362
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,319
Or De las Vegas,

363
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,475
or De las Cuevas...

364
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,756
Maybe it wasn't Fermín.

365
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,514
"You've got one minute
to solve the following enigma.

366
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,518
A sweet seller receives
three opaque boxes.

367
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,955
One box contains mint sweets,

368
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,156
another, aniseed sweets,

369
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,920
and another a mixture
of mint and aniseed.

370
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,754
The boxes have labels which say
"Mint", "Aniseed"

371
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,319
or "Mixture".

372
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,553
But the sweet seller is told that
all the boxes are wrongly labeled.

373
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,639
What is the minimum number of sweets
the man will have to take out

374
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,678
to verify the contents
of the boxes?"

375
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,030
Don't tell me the greatest enigma
ever set out is this rubbish!

376
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,912
A stimulating problem!

377
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,751
Listen to me.

378
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,514
What happens if we don't
solve it in a minute?

379
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,718
Read it again, Oliva.

380
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,270
There are 3 boxes,

381
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,590
one with mint sweets,
one with aniseed sweets

382
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,876
and one with a mixture.

383
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,359
They're wrongly labeled.

384
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,519
How can you label them, removing
the smallest number of sweets?

385
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,037
It's easy,
you take one from each box.

386
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,192
No, because you'd have
one of mint, one of aniseed

387
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,555
and one that could be of either.

388
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,910
How do you know
where the mixture is?

389
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,398
This wall is moving.

390
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,389
Let's see,

391
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,357
to know which is the mixture,

392
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,993
you have to take out
more than one.

393
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,435
So, you take out three,
and all are aniseed.

394
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,518
Can you be sure
it's the box of aniseed?

395
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,433
It's a problem of probabilities.

396
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,031
Just take out one sweet.
It's an infantile problem.

397
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,790
The key is in the statement:

398
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,236
all the boxes, "all the boxes",
are wrongly labeled.

399
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,839
If that is so,

400
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,355
you just have to take
one sweet from the "Mixture"

401
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,551
because the mixture
can't be in there.

402
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,876
If the sweet is mint,
the box is mint.

403
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,758
So where is the mixture?

404
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,148
They can't be here,

405
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,032
because then the aniseed
would be here

406
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,111
and the box would be
correctly labeled.

407
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,959
But as they're
all wrongly labeled,

408
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,078
the mixture is in here

409
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,674
and the aniseed sweets are here.
Answer:

410
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,069
one sweet.

411
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,431
OK, I'll put it here
and see what happens.

412
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,114
Correct.

413
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,272
Now will you listen to me?

414
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,918
The room is shrinking.

415
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,639
Didn't it open outwards?

416
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,428
An enigma.

417
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,194
"You've got one minute
to break the following code:

418
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,636
- One, one..."
- What's the code?

419
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,951
It's a huge list
of ones and zeros.

420
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,350
If we take longer than a minute,

421
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,636
the room will shrink again.

422
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,189
This must be a game.
It's...

423
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,231
a joke by our host.

424
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,153
Let me see. 1, 1, 1, 0, 1...

425
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,477
- How many numbers?
- I'm counting them...

426
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,439
169.

427
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,112
You know what 169 is, don't you?

428
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,829
I've got an idea.
I need pieces of something.

429
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,955
This...

430
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,470
Look,

431
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,472
over two months ago
Mr. Román Naranjo

432
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,274
bought four hydraulic presses.

433
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,636
Is it normal for a host to go
to so much trouble to play a joke?

434
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,949
I don't know.

435
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,754
You said you'd been
in lots of gatherings like this.

436
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,714
No, not in lots,
I've been in two.

437
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,596
Two, counting this one.

438
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,910
Fermat, Román Naranjo, whatever,

439
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,832
doesn't want to play a joke.

440
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,312
He wants to commit a crime.

441
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,433
He's bought four Poseidon
hydraulic presses,

442
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,119
one for each wall.

443
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,479
And I guess he's connected
the system to the PDA.

444
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,156
He's assigned a time
to each riddle

445
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,998
and if we take longer

446
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,310
the presses move again.

447
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,751
- Will you be much longer?
- Not much.

448
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,558
This room is about 50 sq. meters.

449
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,190
If each press advances
10 cm. per minute...

450
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,712
That means in an hour this room
will be the size of an elevator.

451
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,388
An elevator with
too much furniture.

452
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,679
We'll fix this another way.

453
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,229
Will someone help me?

454
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,152
- Where do you want to go?
- You're wasting your time.

455
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,153
Do you know what a press like that
is used for in real life?

456
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,639
Inform us.

457
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,673
Have you ever seen

458
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,878
the presses that turn cars
into a cube of scrap?

459
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,477
When those presses
are no use anymore,

460
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,231
they're made into a cube
by a press like the one back there.

461
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,679
There's another one there,

462
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,829
and there,

463
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,439
and there too.

464
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,550
All right!

465
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,630
Push!

466
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,710
All right!

467
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,915
That's it!

468
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,555
That's it!

469
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,515
Shit!

470
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,598
What fucking kind of gathering
is this?

471
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,792
What have we done to that guy?

472
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,077
Just sit down and keep trying
to find the answer!

473
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,712
We have to solve the enigmas
in the time we're given.

474
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,717
Yes,

475
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,717
but we're human,
we'll get tired.

476
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,158
The machines won't.

477
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,435
Why do you think
he wants to crush us?

478
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,190
No, not you lot.
You're just extras.

479
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,471
He wants to kill me.

480
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,117
<i>It's to do with his daughter.</i>

481
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,878
A few months ago,
I managed something important.

482
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,917
I sold a patent.

483
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,993
It was for a doll

484
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,236
that made popcorn.

485
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,078
You've seen it.

486
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,711
They organized a party.
The company director was coming

487
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,673
but he rang to say he'd be late,
it was raining

488
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,677
and impossible to find a taxi.

489
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,555
I offered to go and get him.

490
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,713
I got in my car, started it
and drove to his house.

491
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,631
I'd gone about a kilometer

492
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,113
when suddenly

493
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,238
I noticed a strange smell
in the car.

494
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,957
It was dog shit.

495
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,589
What would
the director think

496
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,194
if he got into that gas chamber
on wheels?

497
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,237
You didn't open the windows?

498
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,999
It was raining too hard.

499
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,356
I thought of something better.

500
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,991
I'd put my shoe
in the glove compartment.

501
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,791
I took off my shoe.

502
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,193
I put it in the glove compartment.

503
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,031
When I looked up

504
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,150
there was a girl in front of me,

505
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,831
crossing without looking,
without traffic lights, nothing.

506
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,549
I wasn't going fast.

507
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,712
If I'd braked then,
nothing would have happened.

508
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,788
But I didn't.

509
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,399
At that moment

510
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,631
I imagined my bare foot

511
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,872
pressing the brake pedal
smeared with shit.

512
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,309
Even so, I braked.

513
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,834
But those milliseconds of doubt
had delayed me

514
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,352
and I hit the girl.

515
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,918
I called an ambulance
and waited for it to arrive

516
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,431
but then I drove off.

517
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,350
But she had crossed
where she shouldn't.

518
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,710
All you did wrong was to run away.

519
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,874
I went to the police station
the next day.

520
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,112
When the effect of the drinks
from the party had worn off?

521
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,032
I tried to apologize to her family

522
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,236
but they wouldn't let me see them.

523
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,598
When I saw this photo

524
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,111
in Román's wallet,

525
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,318
I put it all together.

526
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,512
And the cynic said he was going
to see his daughter!

527
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,596
I've got it!

528
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,479
169 must be 13 by 13,
the coordinates of a square.

529
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,274
The ones and zeros form a face.
See?

530
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,796
0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0...

531
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,758
So the answer to the problem:

532
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,069
a face.
I'll put it in.

533
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,799
It hasn't stopped.

534
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,793
It's not a face.

535
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,833
It's a skull.

536
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,514
I'll put it in.

537
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,675
CORRECT

538
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,790
Fermat wants to kill you.
I understand that much.

539
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,394
But what about us?

540
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,518
Do we have to die because
you knocked someone down?

541
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,670
You're circumstantial victims.
He wants to kill me.

542
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,554
You're all part of this trap.

543
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,554
A new enigma!

544
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,230
Come on, we've got one minute.

545
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,514
Stop drinking.

546
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,551
We need clear neurons.

547
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,119
Let's see:

548
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,557
"Inside a hermetically sealed room

549
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,159
there is a light bulb,

550
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,153
and outside the room
there are three switches.

551
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,235
Only one of the three
lights the bulb.

552
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,192
While the door is closed,

553
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,119
you can press the switches
as often as you want.

554
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,879
But when you open the door,

555
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,196
you have to say which
of the 3 switches

556
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,913
lights the bulb."

557
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,429
Shit!

558
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,318
Let's imagine we push

559
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,239
two switches,
1 and 2.

560
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,513
We open the door
and the bulb isn't lit.

561
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,428
That would mean
the correct switch is 3.

562
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,069
- But if...
- And we parked at the lake!

563
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,152
...we still don't know
if the right one is 1 or 2.

564
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,754
He'll be sinking our cars now
to leave no trace.

565
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,599
Let's concentrate.

566
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,872
Something doesn't fit.

567
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,595
What if I hadn't solved
the enigma on the invitation?

568
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,711
The numbers were
in alphabetical order, it was easy.

569
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,428
Did anyone help you,
or give you a clue?

570
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,949
No.

571
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,198
<i>Put back any books you use</i>
<i>in alphabetical order.</i>

572
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,355
Let's concentrate on the switches
and the light bulb.

573
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,953
Time's running out.

574
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,829
Why is he going to so much trouble
to get his revenge?

575
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,151
- Why doesn't he just shoot you?
- Stop it!

576
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,878
I don't know
what Fermat wants from us,

577
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,157
but he thinks the simplest way
to get it

578
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,198
- is with this room.
- I've got a theory

579
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,271
but let's solve this first.

580
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,911
Great! Now we'll be in the dark!

581
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,749
- What is it?
- Nothing.

582
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,239
I burned myself.

583
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,148
You burned yourself.

584
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,236
The trick is in the temperature
of the bulbs!

585
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,478
We turn on a switch, 1,
and leave it on for a while.

586
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,598
Then we switch it off,
switch on 2 and open the door.

587
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,274
If the bulb is lit,
the right switch is 2.

588
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,034
If it's off and is hot,
the right switch is 1,

589
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,872
which we'd left on for a while.

590
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,356
If it's off and cold,
the right switch is 3.

591
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,113
Case resolved.

592
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,114
That's the solution.

593
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,597
Come on...

594
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,629
Correct.

595
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,995
Oliva,

596
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,599
what's your theory about
what's going on?

597
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,393
For me, the jacket is the key.

598
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,680
Did Fermat forget it
or leave it behind on purpose?

599
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,793
I think he left it
on purpose

600
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,951
so Pascal would find
the girl's photo.

601
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,675
Without that jacket,

602
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,559
Pascal wouldn't know
why Fermat wants to kill him.

603
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,519
But there is a reason,
the accident.

604
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,636
We three don't know
why Fermat wants to kill us.

605
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,155
I don't know what,

606
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,832
but we've done something.

607
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,669
Hot, isn't it?

608
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,558
The Audi, how much is it?

609
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,511
- Which Audi? The maroon one?
- Yes.

610
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,510
There only is one.

611
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,791
I'm in a hurry, really.

612
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,032
45 euros, please.

613
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,357
45, Christ's age.

614
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,838
Shit, I forgot my wallet.

615
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,471
You don't leave without paying.

616
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,549
<i>But...</i>

617
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,470
- Did you know Fermat before?
- No.

618
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,834
This is me.

619
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,752
Without any pseudonym.
I don't know what I did to be here.

620
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,118
I knocked his daughter down,
I told you that.

621
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,397
I'm a mathematician because
it's the only thing I can do.

622
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,515
Apart from that,

623
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,790
I return video tapes
without rewinding them,

624
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,916
I lie in electoral surveys,

625
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,593
I take communion
without fasting,

626
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,871
I pick fruit without using
plastic gloves.

627
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,758
Could anyone hate me
for things like that?

628
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,628
I've got no enemies.

629
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,593
I harm no one,
so no one harms me.

630
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,675
Are you sure?

631
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,074
I spent five years working on
Goldbach's Conjecture.

632
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,317
Three weeks before the presentation
someone got into my room

633
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,515
and destroyed everything.

634
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,230
You're 26.

635
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,475
And?

636
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,511
That's the age
at which Oliva Sabuco died.

637
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,676
How old are you?

638
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,629
Twenty-two.

639
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,478
Evariste Galois died at 22.

640
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,917
And Blas Pascal died at 39,
the age I am now.

641
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,434
And at what age
did David Hilbert die?

642
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,597
Pierre Fermat died at 64.

643
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,558
Román Naranjo is 64!

644
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,312
I'm sick of this guy!

645
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,150
I bet he's here, looking at us
from some hiding place.

646
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,036
Román!

647
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,553
What do you want?

648
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,754
Now we'll have
seven years of bad luck.

649
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,917
Anyone want to hear the new enigma?

650
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,030
"How can you time
a period of 9 minutes,

651
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,909
using two sand clocks,
one of 4 minutes and one of 7?"

652
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,753
We've got 2 minutes.

653
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,116
Here.

654
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,793
This might help you.

655
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,157
Pascal,

656
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,589
do you think the presses will stop

657
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,316
when the shelves are all together?

658
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,120
Only one thing
can stop a Poseidon press.

659
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,798
Two Poseidon presses.

660
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,228
We've got four.

661
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,158
Can't we set them
against each other?

662
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,430
All right.

663
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,192
This is the plan
of the room.

664
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,272
The door was here,

665
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,873
the blackboard,

666
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,634
this is the table,

667
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,596
and here,

668
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,434
here, and here
are the bookcases.

669
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,756
Maybe we can neutralize
the forces.

670
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,228
Sooner or later,

671
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,194
you'll have to tell them
what you know.

672
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,117
What do the bookcases measure?

673
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,631
About 2 meters high.

674
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,029
And the width?

675
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,997
All together,
no more than 4 meters.

676
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,116
So,

677
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,833
if we do...

678
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,430
this...

679
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,200
- I know what you want to do.
- Will it work?

680
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,551
There's just one way to find out.

681
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,435
The way to find out
is by doing it.

682
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,638
Oh, right.

683
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,475
I've got it.
I'll send the answer.

684
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,509
How long have we got?

685
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,710
20 seconds.

686
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,518
Check the answer.
We need the time.

687
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,274
I'm sure.

688
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,398
We start the two clocks
at the same time,

689
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,629
the 4 and the 7.

690
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,678
When the 4 finishes
four minutes will have passed.

691
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,108
We turn it upside down.

692
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,198
Three minutes later,
the sand in 7 is finished.

693
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,275
We turn it
upside down.

694
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,318
When the sand has finished in 4
the second time,

695
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,629
eight minutes have passed.

696
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,432
But 7 will have timed one minute.

697
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,199
We turn it over

698
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,993
and we've got the nine minutes.

699
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,313
- You see it?
- Yes, absolutely.

700
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,914
One second left.
I'll send it now.

701
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,749
A new enigma.

702
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,076
I'll read it out.

703
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,753
"A student asks his teacher:

704
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,154
How old are your daughters?

705
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,156
The teacher answers:

706
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,555
If you multiply their ages
you get 36.

707
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,631
If you add them, you get
your house number.

708
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,153
I'm missing a detail,
protests the student.

709
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,551
The teacher answers: You're right,
the eldest plays the piano.

710
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,392
How old are the three daughters?"

711
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,988
That's surrealistic!

712
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,515
One daughter is 9,
and there are twins of 2.

713
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,472
But don't send it yet.
We need time.

714
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,550
How do you know?

715
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,154
It's a classic,
I can't explain now.

716
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,155
You think it'll resist?

717
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,429
Pressure is unpredictable.

718
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,272
It can turn coal into dust
or a diamond.

719
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,475
Was that Archimedes?

720
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,153
No, MacGyver.

721
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,231
Hurry!

722
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,637
Come on!

723
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,193
Put the answer in the PDA!

724
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,270
I haven't got it!

725
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,111
What?

726
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,075
Who's got it?

727
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,272
It was on the table
when you overturned it!

728
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,794
It had to fall here!

729
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,069
What's that?

730
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,798
Fermat's invitation.

731
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,278
- What?
- The invitation he brought.

732
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,508
Why did the host
bring an invitation?

733
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,592
It's addressed
to Román Naranjo López.

734
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,198
"Only you and four others

735
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,157
have been invited to the gathering
I'm organizing."

736
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,951
"On Friday, July 25, at 22:00,
come to the warehouse..."

737
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,438
He was told to come here!

738
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,554
"Remember to bring your cell phone.

739
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,837
Your pseudonym during
the gathering will be

740
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,470
Fermat."

741
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,549
What is this?

742
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,192
We should look for the PDA
while there's room.

743
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,555
Don't you get it?

744
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,669
They arranged for Román to arrive
ten minutes after we did,

745
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,349
and he was told to introduce himself
as Fermat.

746
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,999
When Román arrived,
as he was the last,

747
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,351
we all assumed he was the host.

748
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,995
If he wasn't the host,

749
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,356
why did he sit
at the head of the table?

750
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,798
He sat in the seat we left for him,
thinking he was the host.

751
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,791
So he impersonated the host?

752
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,560
No, Román never knew
he was our host.

753
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,109
That's why he seemed odd.

754
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,032
<i>You'd better carry on without me.</i>

755
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,428
How could we carry on
without him?

756
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,268
Why was only he told
to bring a cell phone?

757
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,355
To tell him the story
about the hospital.

758
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,435
<i>Yes?</i>

759
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,631
Román is innocent.

760
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,550
I'm sure of it.

761
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,712
I think he didn't
even recognize you.

762
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,069
The PDA!

763
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,715
I'll send it.

764
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,676
CORRECT

765
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,639
You rang me, I left a meeting,
I forgot my wallet,

766
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,717
I drove 60 km.,
I ran out of gas,

767
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,473
I have to go back to pay for it...

768
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,392
But I'm saying we didn't call you!

769
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,433
Maybe you didn't,
but someone here did.

770
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,073
Speak to the nurse.

771
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,674
Speak to the nurse!

772
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,154
Mr. Naranjo, listen to me.

773
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,958
We're in a hospital!

774
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,755
OK.

775
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,912
Show me the number
on your cell phone.

776
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,639
It says "Private number".

777
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,509
When we call, the switchboard
number comes up.

778
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,109
Mr. Naranjo,
your daughter is still stable.

779
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,397
We didn't call you.

780
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,590
All I know is I have to drive
60 km. to the meeting,

781
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,710
get my wallet,

782
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,831
go back
and pay for the gas

783
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,191
and drive another 60 km.

784
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,875
Mr. Naranjo,

785
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,478
why not leave it for tomorrow?

786
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,470
Go home and rest.

787
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,148
Yes, thank you.

788
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,948
My house keys are in the jacket too.

789
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,635
You realize?

790
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,914
The keys, the jacket, the gas...

791
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,839
I feel so sorry for him.

792
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,759
<i>What I don't understand is</i>
<i>if Román didn't organize all this,</i>

793
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,029
who did?

794
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,794
The person who destroyed
your demonstration?

795
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,439
That was some kid
who was jealous.

796
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,074
Come on, a kid doesn't go into
a hall of residence,

797
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,350
destroy documents
and leave without being seen.

798
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,829
Miss Oliva, you shouldn't
solve a problem

799
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,992
with information that isn't
in the formulation.

800
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,389
How do you know where it happened?

801
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,830
We were dating for two years.

802
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,075
Then we broke up.

803
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,032
Why did you break up?

804
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,314
Ask her.

805
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,949
She might tell you.

806
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,388
We broke up, that's all.

807
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,675
Soon after, I got the invitation
to come here.

808
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,194
I thought it was your doing.

809
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,788
If I called you,
it was to clarify it.

810
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,231
I thought if we pretended not to
know each other, started again...

811
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,310
That was your idea.

812
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,430
Yes, and I stick by it.

813
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,073
In the False Land,
all the inhabitants always lie.

814
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,875
In the True Land,

815
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,548
all the inhabitants
always tell the truth.

816
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,912
"A stranger is trapped in a room
that has two doors.

817
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,549
One door leads to freedom,
the other doesn't.

818
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,678
The doors are guarded by a jailer
from the False Land

819
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,518
and by another from the True Land.

820
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,359
To find the door to freedom,

821
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,398
the stranger can only ask
one question to one of the jailers,

822
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,711
but he doesn't know
which is from the False Land

823
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,478
and which is from the True Land.

824
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,194
What question did he ask?"

825
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,192
We've got less than a minute.

826
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,919
I saw that in a film.

827
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,879
One jailer always tells the truth.
Imagine that it's you.

828
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,348
The other lies. You.

829
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,509
It should be the other way round.

830
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,552
You're the man locked in the room.

831
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,000
If I ask which door
is the right one...

832
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,355
You don't know which is lying.

833
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,790
I've got an idea.

834
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,156
If I asked you which door
he'd tell me is the right one...

835
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,477
As I always tell the truth,
I'd tell you

836
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,993
he'd say that one.

837
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,829
I've got it.
You have to ask one of them

838
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,071
which door the other one
would tell me is the right one.

839
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,436
As you would both point
at the wrong door,

840
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,756
I take the opposite one.
Get it?

841
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,110
Careful!

842
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,956
Correct.

843
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,631
Why did you two break up?

844
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,238
He got it into his head
that I had a lover.

845
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,715
You couldn't convince him otherwise?

846
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,957
It's a problem of ages.

847
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,595
I'll calculate it,
I'm the most aged.

848
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,313
I never...

849
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,798
I never liked Internet.

850
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,790
But one day I went in

851
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,679
to play chess.

852
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,914
What's more innocent than playing
chess with someone you can't see?

853
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,953
From time to time,

854
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,918
we sent messages

855
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,954
until

856
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,955
one day something happened with him

857
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,274
that had never happened
to me before with anyone.

858
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,279
He beat me.

859
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,679
We played chess dozens of times
and he always beat me.

860
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,190
So I got interested in him.

861
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,476
One day the idea came up

862
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,789
about meeting to play
face to face.

863
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,391
He invited me to a party where
there would be important people.

864
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,509
In his house?

865
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,430
No.

866
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,399
Not in his house.

867
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,074
On a boat.

868
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,515
On a boat?

869
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,676
Why?

870
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,797
That's what I wondered too.

871
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,194
Why on a boat?

872
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,359
Then I found out.

873
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,792
It had to be out at sea
because at that party

874
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,871
things happened that would be
illegal in any country.

875
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,558
You want to know what things?

876
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:00,956
Come on.

877
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,994
Dare to ask.

878
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,754
No, forget it.

879
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,355
At that party

880
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,079
things happened,

881
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,630
and the things that happened

882
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,791
made me go back more times.

883
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,314
Wait a minute.

884
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,030
Couldn't that guy
have organized all this?

885
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:32,837
No.

886
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,316
Why not? He's idle, eccentric,
smart, rich. Why can't he be...

887
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,232
It can't be him
because he's in here!

888
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,989
Time's up.

889
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,197
Want to hear the problem?

890
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,470
"The mother is 21 years older
than the son."

891
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,596
I never thought he'd be here.

892
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,877
"In 6 years he will be
5 times younger than the mother.

893
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,075
What's the father doing?"

894
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,438
We've got 10 seconds.

895
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,393
You both deserve to die here!

896
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,229
What are you doing?
You'll die too!

897
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,234
I don't care!

898
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,188
You don't care
if you die?

899
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,598
All this is too interesting

900
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,880
for the person who organized it
to miss it.

901
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,192
If I'd organized all this,
I wouldn't settle just for revenge.

902
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,789
I'd want to see it all.

903
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,709
What do you mean?

904
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,112
The culprit could be someone
so keen to kill his victim

905
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,238
that he doesn't mind dying.

906
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,791
Are you saying I'm capable
of organizing all this?

907
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,513
You said that they deserve to die
and you don't care about anything.

908
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,314
Breaking this PDA

909
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,114
is the closest thing you could do
to killing us.

910
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,158
You knew there was
something between us.

911
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,318
All this is just your style,
so childish.

912
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,792
Those pedantic enigmas,
those stupid brain teasers...

913
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,438
Did you have to organize
all this?

914
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,190
You could have bought four hydraulic
presses in Román Naranjo's name.

915
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,591
You could have set up the room,
sent the invitations.

916
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,791
You could have done it.

917
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,559
But you didn't.

918
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,109
What?

919
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,391
I've just realized
he didn't do it.

920
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,552
Remember after the supper.

921
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,031
We were moving around,
clearing the table

922
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,356
and waiting for Fermat
to set out the famous enigma.

923
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,709
Then there was an unexpected sound.

924
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,870
That call was a fundamental part
of the plan.

925
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,034
Fermat would have to leave the room
and we'd suspect him.

926
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,912
Whoever made the call

927
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,630
was the person
who organized all this.

928
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,112
He couldn't have done it
because

929
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,112
he was next to me on the couch.

930
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,237
Only one person could have
made that call.

931
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,912
The one who wasn't in the room
when Fermat was on the phone.

932
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,394
<i>Is anything wrong?</i>

933
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,713
You just have to

934
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,194
resolve one X.

935
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,594
Efrén Cuevas!

936
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,679
He sent the letters.

937
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,033
It wasn't Fermín.

938
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,276
It was Efrén!

939
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,914
The last call was made at 22:55.

940
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,473
You called Fermat
from this phone.

941
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,948
Call for help!

942
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,759
There's no time.

943
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,309
Call Fermat.
Maybe he's on his way back.

944
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,072
Fermat is dead.

945
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,149
Good evening.

946
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,191
Your driving license, please.

947
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,075
I haven't got it.

948
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,829
Well, I do, but it's in a house
5 km. from here.

949
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,191
Follow me and I'll show it to you.

950
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,073
Please, I'm asking you.

951
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,839
Follow me,
it's very close.

952
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,471
Why don't you come with me?

953
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,791
Please, I'm begging you,
really.

954
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,515
Please.

955
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,349
No answer.

956
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,869
How do you stop this?

957
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:29,956
How do we get out?

958
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,839
There is no way out.

959
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,314
You'll die too.

960
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,153
I've been preparing this moment
for some time.

961
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,355
I even made a model.

962
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,354
May I?

963
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,114
Here it is.

964
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,950
My demonstration that
Goldbach's Conjecture is correct.

965
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,469
You destroyed his demonstration?

966
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,234
I?

967
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,835
Two months ago I was so close
to demonstrating it.

968
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,198
I was only missing a few
minor verifications. And,

969
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,078
suddenly I saw this!

970
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,118
35 years looking for an answer

971
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,512
and a kid finds it
ten days before you.

972
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,157
And saying things like:

973
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,910
"My only merit is being young".

974
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,878
I didn't know what to do.

975
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,950
I considered committing suicide.

976
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,199
But I felt

977
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,590
a brutal curiosity

978
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,199
to meet you.

979
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,070
Then

980
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,352
I read this in the press.

981
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,388
"The solution to the greatest
mathematical enigma

982
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,829
sabotaged."

983
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,232
I sent you an e-mail,
but your girlfriend answered.

984
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,515
That's how we met.

985
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,349
She confirmed what
I found so hard to believe.

986
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,313
Your work was sabotaged

987
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,074
and you had to re-do everything.

988
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,678
I was immersed night and day
in Goldbach's Conjecture

989
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,030
until I managed to prove it.

990
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,679
Here it is.

991
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,550
Thank you.

992
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,589
This is brilliant.

993
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,911
I demonstrated the Conjecture
but you did it first.

994
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,151
Even if you take
another three years

995
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,719
you'll still be the first.

996
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,148
Unless

997
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,193
you don't manage
to recover it.

998
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:20,036
And why can't you see
what the father's doing

999
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,872
if the mother is 21 years older
than the son?

1000
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,195
I can't take any more!

1001
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,869
- I can't!
- Come on!

1002
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,833
In 6 years, the son will be
5 times younger than the mother!

1003
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,194
What is the father doing?

1004
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,429
It's a negative result!

1005
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,828
It's possible!

1006
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,073
The son has
minus three quarters of a year.

1007
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,559
What is the father doing?

1008
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,432
- I don't know!
- Leave him alone!

1009
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,319
Minus three quarters
is minus nine months!

1010
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,991
The father is screwing the mother.

1011
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,513
I set up this room
to put your intelligence

1012
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,155
to the test.

1013
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,873
I'll give you your grades.

1014
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,553
What have Román and I
to do with this?

1015
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,632
Tomorrow they'll think Román
took his revenge on you

1016
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,838
and we were all sacrificed.

1017
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,951
When they blame Román
he'll defend himself.

1018
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,838
I told you, he's dead.

1019
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,759
He can't be.
I saw him drive away.

1020
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,031
After supper,

1021
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,839
we cleared the table.

1022
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,757
I didn't think the situation
with the false host

1023
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,951
would be so much fun.

1024
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,315
Before things
got out of my control,

1025
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,513
I went out to make the famous call.

1026
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:30,831
<i>Good evening, Mr. Naranjo.</i>
<i>I'm calling from the hospital.</i>

1027
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,435
<i>Yes?</i>

1028
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,279
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

1029
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,280
You very cleverly discovered that.

1030
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,749
But you don't know
that while I was talking to him

1031
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,117
I put phosgene in the clasp
of his safety belt.

1032
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,957
<i>You have to come here</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

1033
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,434
<i>Your daughter...</i>

1034
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,036
If inhaled, phosgene causes
asphyxia in less than two minutes,

1035
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,633
it leaves no trace

1036
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,989
and if you're driving...

1037
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,469
<i>I think I have to leave.</i>

1038
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,954
<i>Is anything wrong?</i>

1039
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,592
...the accident hides
the cause of death.

1040
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,110
- What are you doing?
- Calling Fermat.

1041
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,954
I never answer
if I'm driving.

1042
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,158
One must be careful.

1043
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,669
Don't you know that 28%
of people who die on the roads

1044
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,955
travel like you,

1045
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,555
without their safety belt?

1046
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,954
So all the rest, the other 72%,

1047
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,310
die with their belt on.

1048
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,719
I don't believe
you don't mind dying.

1049
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,718
When they find us,
I'll be clinging to this dossier.

1050
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,711
I'll go down in history
as the mathematician

1051
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,518
who demonstrated
Goldbach's Conjecture.

1052
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,590
That's enough for me.

1053
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,551
It's my fault for lying.

1054
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,709
What?

1055
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,558
I didn't resolve
Goldbach's Conjecture.

1056
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,031
I told you I was working on it
so you'd notice me.

1057
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,118
And it worked.

1058
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,195
Then the lie got bigger,

1059
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,839
there were interviews,

1060
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,037
they asked for a demonstration.
I didn't know how to gain time.

1061
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,272
No one went into my room.

1062
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,632
I destroyed everything.

1063
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,393
I didn't know what to do.

1064
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,318
I did it for you.

1065
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:48,995
I did it for you!

1066
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,515
Then,

1067
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,751
I really was the first.

1068
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,116
I resolved Goldbach's Conjecture
before anyone.

1069
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,316
- What are you doing?
- He deserved it!

1070
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,196
He's thought of some way
of getting out!

1071
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,430
I don't believe that story
about dying with the dossier.

1072
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,392
I'm sure
he had an escape planned.

1073
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,556
Why don't we just admit
we're going to die?

1074
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,231
We'll die at the same age
as Galois, Sabuco, Pascal,

1075
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,835
but David Hilbert died
in his 80s.

1076
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,716
This guy wasn't intending to die.

1077
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,192
This room was a test
of our intelligence.

1078
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,312
There must be a way
of passing it.

1079
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,157
FREEDOM

1080
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,230
It's breaking!

1081
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,155
It's a bolt!

1082
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,556
Come on.

1083
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:39,558
- There's only room for one.
- No, I won't fit!

1084
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,358
If your head fits,
your body fits.

1085
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,715
Try putting your ass in a helmet!

1086
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,874
- I'm out!
- Send it up!

1087
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,792
- The exit is blocked!
- I can't!

1088
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:57,955
Push it up!

1089
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,151
- Push it up!
- I can't, it's too heavy!

1090
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,510
Try to push it!

1091
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,311
I'll try with this.

1092
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,835
Go on, you next.

1093
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,956
- Hurry up!
- No, no, wait!

1094
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,513
- What is it?
- Just a second!

1095
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,069
- We don't have a second!
- Got it!

1096
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,236
Shit!

1097
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,709
What's wrong?

1098
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,671
My pants have got caught!

1099
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,869
Look.

1100
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,199
The last quarter.

1101
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,629
How ironic.

1102
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,797
It's shrinking too.

1103
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,758
What'll you do with that?

1104
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,194
It's a problem.

1105
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,717
If I publish this demonstration
just as it is,

1106
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,710
Efrén Cuevas will go down in History
and he'll have won.

1107
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,235
But if I publish it with my name
it wouldn't be ethical,

1108
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,354
but it would be the easiest for me,
and take a load of my mind.

1109
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,510
- What are you doing?
- Problem resolved.

1110
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,155
But why?

1111
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,395
It was the solution to a problem
unsolved for over 250 years.

1112
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,793
How can you do that to the world?

1113
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,033
The world is as it was.

1114
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,278
