2
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:53,164
The hero of today's hunt
is Lord Ichimonji.

3
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:56,994
His was the arrow
that felled the boar.

4
00:02:57,704 --> 00:02:59,968
Let us drink to him.

5
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:15,946
The infernal beast
charged right in front of me.

6
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:21,387
My horse reared, and down I went
before I could even draw my bow.

7
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,621
Father,

8
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,199
shall we have the boar roasted?

9
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:34,531
He was old.
His flesh would be tough and gamy.

10
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:36,704
Not fit to eat.

11
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:42,813
Just like me.

12
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,906
Think you could eat me?

13
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:48,249
You'd stick in our throats.

14
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:51,685
No, our purpose in joining your hunt

15
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:54,893
was to deepen our friendship.

16
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:56,652
Indeed.

17
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:02,160
And it is to cement the bonds
between our two houses

18
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:05,098
that I would have my daughter

19
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:07,829
marry your third son, Saburo.

20
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,632
Now wait a moment.

21
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:11,935
That's my wish as well.

22
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:16,614
Lord Ichimonji,
this is an excellent opportunity.

23
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:18,841
Give us your answer.

24
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:22,713
Whom would you choose
for your son, Saburo -

25
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,252
my daughter or Lord Ayabe's?

26
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:31,696
What a quandary.

27
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:35,793
Two daughters
but only one son.

28
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:40,739
A pity my second son, Jiro,
already has a wife.

29
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:52,651
Kyoami.

30
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:54,319
Come entertain us.

31
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:35,758
<i>From the far mountain</i>

32
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:40,192
<i>From the near mountain</i>

33
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,960
<i>Who comes hippety-hopping</i>

34
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,970
<i>With two tall blades
pointing out of his head</i>

35
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:57,109
<i>A hare</i>

36
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:03,513
Just one hare, Kyoami?

37
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:06,350
I think I see two.

38
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:11,426
They've come hopping through
the mountains to be eaten up by Father.

39
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,326
Hold your tongue, Saburo!

40
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,897
Don't be an ass!

41
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:42,352
It appears Lord Ichimonji is tired.

42
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:46,189
Let us withdraw until he awakens.

43
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:08,315
It's not like Father
to nod off in front of guests.

44
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:10,949
He's just feigning sleep.

45
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:15,457
After Saburo's insult,
how else could he save face?

46
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,120
He's never done this before.

47
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,789
It was only a boar hunt.

48
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:55,483
He used to rout an entire army
and be none the worse for wear.

49
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,455
It's impolite
to Lords Ayabe and Fujimaki.

50
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:01,166
Kyoami, wake Lord Ichimonji.

51
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,528
I'm more worried about Father.

52
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,100
He's not snoring
as he usually does.

53
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:13,374
- Father! Is something wrong?
- Are you ill?

54
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,680
So it was a dream.

55
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,625
I had a dream.

56
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:40,262
I was walking
through a desolate field...

57
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,176
never encountering another soul

58
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:48,437
no matter how far I went,

59
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,340
hearing no reply
no matter how loudly I shouted.

60
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,083
I was alone.

61
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:03,190
All alone in the whole wide world.

62
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:07,830
I was terrified.

63
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,611
How silly of me.

64
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:30,118
Taro's voice
brought me back,

65
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,684
and there you all were,
my beloved sons.

66
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,727
Taro...

67
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,696
Jiro...

68
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:44,959
and Saburo.

69
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,566
I've never seen you
like this, Father.

70
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:51,800
You make me uneasy.

71
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:54,070
Watch your tongue, Saburo!

72
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,408
Have you no gratitude
for your father's affection?

73
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:02,243
Actually, I too have difficulty
believing what Father just said.

74
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:06,650
We're utterly helpless
without Father's guidance.

75
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:09,654
Are you implying instead
that he relies on us?

76
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,890
Patience, now.

77
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:23,139
I've been thinking about that,

78
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:26,140
and I've come to a decision.

79
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,777
I want to tell you about it now.

80
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:33,983
This is as good a time as any -

81
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:39,957
especially with Lord Fujimaki
and Lord Ayabe in our company.

82
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:45,392
Ask them to join us.

83
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,741
I, Hidetora Ichimonji...

84
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:06,475
was born in a small castle
on the far side of that mountain.

85
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:13,290
In those days, this region
was in constant upheaval.

86
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:16,256
Lords great and small
vied for power.

87
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,893
As a lad of 17...

88
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:25,800
I rode forth from that small castle
with my banner raised.

89
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:29,168
For 50 years I waged war...

90
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,069
and at last made
the entire region my domain.

91
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:41,182
I hoisted the Ichimonji colors
atop that great castle.

92
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:43,721
Even after that,

93
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:48,586
I crossed lances a time or two
with Lords Fujimaki and Ayabe here,

94
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:51,688
but we have now set aside
our differences,

95
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,592
stabling the steeds of war

96
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,360
and cultivating
bonds of friendship.

97
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:05,138
But 70 years
have quickly come upon me.

98
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:15,181
As of this day,

99
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:19,017
I cede authority
over the house of Ichimonji

100
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:21,055
to my eldest son, Taro.

101
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:22,854
My lord!

102
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:25,530
- This is too sudden!
- My lord!

103
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:27,597
Not at all.

104
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,668
I've been planning this
for quite some time.

105
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,030
The day has
long been approaching

106
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:37,606
for me to step aside

107
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,837
and lay the mantle
on younger shoulders.

108
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:45,141
I tell you now:
That day has come.

109
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:47,944
I repeat.

110
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:52,314
From this moment forth,
Taro is head of the house of Ichimonji,

111
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:54,784
and lord of this domain.

112
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:58,929
I will yield the keep
of the First Castle to him

113
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:01,155
and move to the outer tower.

114
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:04,131
With me will come
30 of my close attendants,

115
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:08,204
and I shall retain the formal title
and privileges of Great Lord.

116
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:13,143
But all actual authority
shall rest with Taro.

117
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:17,006
This is my decree!

118
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:24,786
We bow to your will, Father.

119
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:28,383
But what of myself and Saburo?

120
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:31,427
What do you intend for us?

121
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,960
Jiro and Saburo,

122
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:40,832
I bestow upon you the Second
and Third Castles and their lands.

123
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:45,870
You will strengthen your fortifications
and aid Taro in defending the First Castle.

124
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:51,012
I shall divide my time

125
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,952
among the three castles,

126
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:57,747
and thus enjoy
my remaining years.

127
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:06,761
Alas, the ravages of age.

128
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,098
If I may, Father.

129
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:12,369
It is a tremendous honor

130
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:14,664
to be named
the head of our house,

131
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,966
but I must beg you to reconsider.

132
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:18,473
Why?

133
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:23,847
Though I am indeed
your eldest son and heir,

134
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:26,141
to rule in your place
is far beyond my abilities.

135
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,548
I have long prayed
to the god of war

136
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:31,881
that you might live
to be a hundred,

137
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,253
even if it means taking
from my own allotment of years.

138
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:37,720
My brother certainly has
a way with words.

139
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:40,523
I'd never have the nerve
to speak such honeyed phrases.

140
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,927
Makes me itch just to hear them.

141
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:47,305
Don't be so contrary.

142
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:52,102
Are you implying
Taro's words were mere flattery?

143
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:56,546
Father, pay no attention
to Saburo.

144
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,484
I share Taro's sentiment.

145
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:05,885
I would far prefer
to remain behind your shield,

146
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:10,050
but it's now our turn
to shield you from life's arrows

147
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:13,959
so that your remaining years
may be filled with ease.

148
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:16,959
Reassuring words, Jiro.

149
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,467
Bring me that quiver!

150
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:37,579
Break this in two.

151
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:44,692
Can you break this?

152
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,626
Now...

153
00:16:53,906 --> 00:16:56,067
break these three arrows
together.

154
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:14,248
A single arrow is easily broken.

155
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,950
Not so three bundled together.

156
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:22,259
Even should a great catastrophe
threaten to overwhelm Taro,

157
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,195
if the three of you join forces
to meet the challenge,

158
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:28,339
the house of Ichimonji
and its domains will be safe.

159
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,209
Father, there are ways to break
even three arrows together.

160
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:48,017
More of your contrariness.

161
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:49,625
Stop playing the fool!

162
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:52,092
You're the one playing the fool -

163
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:53,559
talking nonsense all of a sudden.

164
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:57,326
- Nonsense?
- Yes! You've either gone senile or mad.

165
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,003
Silence!

166
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,102
You dare to insult your father?

167
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:07,004
What madness have I spoken?

168
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,745
What senile nonsense?

169
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:11,573
Very well, since you ask.

170
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:14,946
Consider the times
in which we live.

171
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:18,617
To survive, one must discard
loyalty and affection.

172
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:21,887
- I know that all too well.
- As well you should,

173
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:24,756
since the blood you've spilled
is beyond reckoning.

174
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:27,056
Your lifelong code has been
no pity, no mercy.

175
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,733
But remember, Father,

176
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:32,733
we too are children of this age,
weaned on chaos and strife.

177
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:34,906
Yet, because we are your blood,

178
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,304
you trust in our undying fidelity
as you dream of peaceful retirement.

179
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:43,311
To me, that is nothing
but madness and senility.

180
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:55,923
Very well. I see.

181
00:18:57,362 --> 00:19:01,731
You're saying that someday
you might forget I am your father

182
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,400
and turn against me?

183
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:07,366
More nonsense still! What fool
announces his intent to betray?

184
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,597
Then will Taro or Jiro
turn against me?

185
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:13,835
You resent the fact
Father chose Taro to succeed him.

186
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,640
Saburo, is that why
you slander us this way?

187
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,513
You may be my brother,
but I'll only stand for so much.

188
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:24,450
Father, see what's happened
to your three arrows already?

189
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,682
Can a blood feud be far behind?

190
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:32,495
How dare you?

191
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:36,697
Would you trample
on your father's wishes?

192
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:40,869
Very well! If you insist these times allow
no bonds between parent and child,

193
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:44,809
then consider our bonds severed!

194
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,741
You are now a stranger to me!
Out of my sight!

195
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:51,142
You mustn't, my lord!

196
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:53,180
Silence, Tango.

197
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,977
My mistake was to dote on him
over the others.

198
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,350
I coddled him too much.

199
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:04,991
This swollen head, this insolence -
these are my own creation.

200
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:07,856
But it's too late for regrets.

201
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:11,025
When flesh is rotten,

202
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:14,034
it must be cut away,
even if it's your own!

203
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:17,174
Wait, my lord!
Master Saburo minces no words,

204
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,538
and what he says may seem
disrespectful and even brutal.

205
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:24,876
But it is his upright heart that leads him
to speak with unadorned candor.

206
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,211
If you consider
his words carefully,

207
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,682
you will find truth in them.

208
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:32,550
- Silence!
- No!

209
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:34,252
Desist!

210
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:35,892
I will not!

211
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:38,255
You...

212
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,032
No, my lord!

213
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:48,235
Have you lost your head,
my lord?

214
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,000
As your advisor,
it is my duty to speak frankly.

215
00:20:51,343 --> 00:20:53,777
Brandishing your sword
will not make me budge!

216
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:57,847
- Insolence!
- I beg you, revoke your rash decision!

217
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,983
Your impudence matches Saburo's!

218
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:03,746
I won't have it!
I banish you both!

219
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:05,217
Father!

220
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,273
A terrible predicament.

221
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,746
What do you intend to do,
Master Saburo?

222
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:39,388
It's Father I'm worried about,
not myself.

223
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:42,921
It tears at my heart
to think what lies ahead for him.

224
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:46,358
You're a fool, Tango.

225
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:48,157
Why?

226
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:50,766
Defending me
only got you banished.

227
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:54,305
It's a mistake for you
to be separated from Father...

228
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:57,841
no matter
what the circumstances.

229
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,785
I think they may be after us.

230
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:03,897
Wait a moment, will you?

231
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:08,335
Why do you flee, son-in-law?
- Son-in-law?

232
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:10,343
Let me explain.

233
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:14,444
You incurred your father's wrath
and were exiled.

234
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:19,953
Lord Ayabe and I both
witnessed it all.

235
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:26,020
Now that you've been cast out
and are little more than a beggar -

236
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:31,227
Oh, forgive me!
How should I put it?

237
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:32,902
This is awkward -

238
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:36,437
It's all right. Now that I'm
little more than a beggar -

239
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:38,871
- The offer of marriage is off.
- Naturally.

240
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,809
No, you misunderstand!

241
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:46,382
Those were Lord Ayabe's words
when he withdrew his proposal.

242
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:50,914
But as I set out
on my way home,

243
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:53,323
I began thinking.

244
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:57,894
Your conduct showed
great strength of character.

245
00:23:58,363 --> 00:24:00,331
You're a most interesting fellow.

246
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:04,366
Was I to let a man like you
slip through my fingers?

247
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,696
And so I turned back to find you,

248
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:09,102
only to have you flee.

249
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:12,569
Is my proposal
disagreeable to you?

250
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,836
I don't know what to say.

251
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:20,109
Then come stay with me
while you think it over.

252
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:22,811
You too, Tango.

253
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:26,317
I admire a man
with your backbone.

254
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:30,319
I want you to come as well.

255
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:33,998
It's most kind of you,

256
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,067
but I must decline your invitation.

257
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:42,229
No matter what lowly disguise
I must adopt,

258
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,840
I will remain near Lord Hidetora.

259
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,808
If you'll excuse me.

260
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:19,836
What is it?

261
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:23,208
Lord Hidetora's ladies
are moving to the outer tower.

262
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:25,679
They refuse to yield
to your retinue.

263
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:27,878
This is a blatant affront!

264
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,148
I am now the mistress
of this castle.

265
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:34,052
Etiquette demands
that they make way.

266
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:11,857
Why are my women kneeling
to Taro's wife?

267
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:18,830
It's outrageous!

268
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:21,504
I beg to differ.

269
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:25,137
Now that you've yielded
the throne to Taro,

270
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:27,872
it's only proper.

271
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:36,779
<i>He gives away his house
and gives away his lands</i>

272
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:39,623
<i>A generous man,
the village head</i>

273
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:42,554
<i>Now he's but a scarecrow</i>

274
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,025
<i>Standing out in the field</i>

275
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:50,262
Are you calling me a fool?

276
00:26:50,502 --> 00:26:53,027
No, sire!
The fool kneels here before you.

277
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:57,498
Enduring ridicule,
I seek to entertain.

278
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:01,743
But you, my lord -
you've squandered your domain.

279
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:20,757
You know, Kaede...

280
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,369
now that it all belongs to me,

281
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:29,733
the view
is even more magnificent.

282
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,773
As I recall,

283
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:37,974
a battle standard
used to be kept there.

284
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:44,019
Yes, my father kept his standard
and suit of armor there.

285
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:45,314
What happened to them?

286
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:48,117
I gave them to Father's men
just now.

287
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,754
The armor is of no importance,

288
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:54,058
but the standard -

289
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:57,467
My lord,

290
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:01,730
that standard represents
the head of the house of Ichimonji.

291
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:06,967
But Father said he would retain
the title and privileges of Great Lord.

292
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:10,108
Are you then to be
merely a shadow?

293
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:14,782
What are you saying?

294
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:19,923
He made it clear
I am now lord of this domain.

295
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,453
In that case,

296
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,255
I suggest you act like a lord.

297
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:47,114
Attendants!

298
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,175
What?

299
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:52,379
You want the standard back?
- That's right.

300
00:28:52,724 --> 00:28:55,420
What? One minute you give,
and the next you take back?

301
00:28:55,627 --> 00:28:58,494
Silence!
We have orders from Lord Taro!

302
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:07,603
<i>The new lord
is a gourd in the wind</i>

303
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:11,564
<i>Swinging this way</i>

304
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,242
<i>Swinging that way</i>

305
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:17,278
<i>Spinning in the breeze
on its spindly vine</i>

306
00:29:17,782 --> 00:29:18,874
<i>High in the keep</i>

307
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:22,348
<i>Dangles an empty gourd</i>

308
00:29:23,154 --> 00:29:24,587
<i>Isn't it hilarious</i>

309
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,354
Insolent fool!

310
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:33,555
I'll teach you!

311
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:06,324
<i>The new lord
is a gourd in the wind</i>

312
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:11,535
<i>Swinging this way</i>

313
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:14,569
<i>Swinging that way</i>

314
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:17,831
<i>Spinning in the breeze
on its spindly vine</i>

315
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:23,409
<i>High in the keep
dangles an empty gourd</i>

316
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:26,741
<i>Isn't it hilarious</i>

317
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:29,884
<i>Who is it?</i>

318
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:32,352
<i>Ogura, from the keep.</i>

319
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,363
I bring a message, sire.

320
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:44,364
To celebrate
the transfer of power,

321
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:47,732
Lord Taro wishes to hold
a family gathering in the keep tonight.

322
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:50,430
He requests the honor
of your presence.

323
00:30:51,876 --> 00:30:53,901
Lord Ikoma is invited as well.

324
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:39,053
You call this a family gathering?

325
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:43,761
Father,

326
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:46,225
won't you be seated?

327
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:51,364
You expect me to sit below you?

328
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,404
Who do you think I am?

329
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,902
My husband's
most honorable father.

330
00:31:58,576 --> 00:32:00,271
Is that all?

331
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:04,170
What happened to the Great Lord?
Is he dead?

332
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:07,317
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not being silly!

333
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:21,288
I retain the title and standing
of Great Lord. Have you forgotten that?

334
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:23,467
Of course not.

335
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:30,006
But it seems you've forgotten, Father,
that you made me head of the house.

336
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:32,306
What are you talking about?

337
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,206
I've yielded the keep to you,

338
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,348
moved to the outer tower,
and reduced my retinue.

339
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:42,883
Their number may be few,
but their conduct is intolerable.

340
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:46,656
What am I to make of that song?

341
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:51,151
<i>Swinging this way</i>

342
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:54,263
<i>Swinging that way</i>

343
00:32:54,465 --> 00:32:57,491
<i>Spinning in the breeze
on its spindly vine</i>

344
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:02,102
With such goings-on,
how am I to establish my authority?

345
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:05,673
They're brutish warriors
with no use for niceties.

346
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:08,545
You can't keep them
from enjoying a comic song.

347
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:10,976
There's such a thing
as going too far.

348
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:13,783
The fool's song
blatantly mocks me.

349
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:17,079
It was only natural
for my guard to defend my honor.

350
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:20,950
Yet you loosed your arrow
and killed my man.

351
00:33:21,158 --> 00:33:23,524
I cannot let such things pass.

352
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:28,591
Just this once
I will overlook it,

353
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,864
but I must have your bond

354
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:34,629
that it will not happen again.

355
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:45,246
You will sign that statement

356
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,443
and seal it with your blood.

357
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,993
"Covenant"?

358
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,858
I'm astounded
you'd even suggest this.

359
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,228
Read it!

360
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:15,378
"Covenant.

361
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,173
Item:

362
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:21,242
I cede control over all Ichimonji lands
to my first son, Taro.

363
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:22,578
Item:

364
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:27,786
I declare my first son, Taro,
head of the house of Ichimonji.

365
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:29,925
Item:

366
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:32,721
Although I am his father,

367
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,330
I shall hereafter submit
to Taro's authority

368
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,433
and not act against his will.

369
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:41,462
I attest to the above
in the name of all the deities

370
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:44,072
and hereby affirm this covenant."

371
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:49,178
You expect me to sign and seal
this nonsense with my blood?

372
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:54,016
The items listed here

373
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:56,846
are nothing more
than what you yourself proclaimed

374
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,682
before Lord Ayabe
and Lord Fujimaki.

375
00:35:02,093 --> 00:35:05,187
What does it change
to set it in writing?

376
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:53,737
Are you really my son?

377
00:35:54,378 --> 00:35:58,280
- What a question!
- Is this how a son treats his father?

378
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:02,745
The hen pecks the cock

379
00:36:03,654 --> 00:36:05,815
and makes him crow.

380
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,827
I cannot stay here!

381
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:15,296
Fortunately,

382
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:17,962
I have another son.

383
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:26,066
Thank you for your cooperation.

384
00:37:04,715 --> 00:37:07,878
I was born and raised here
in this, my father's castle...

385
00:37:10,054 --> 00:37:12,045
and sent forth from here

386
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,450
to marry you.

387
00:37:18,629 --> 00:37:21,792
After our marriage,
my father and brothers

388
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:24,330
let down their guard...

389
00:37:26,003 --> 00:37:29,439
and fell to your father's sword.

390
00:37:35,513 --> 00:37:39,472
How I've longed for this day...

391
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,919
ever since
I returned to this castle.

392
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,313
It was in this very room
that my mother took her life.

393
00:38:44,982 --> 00:38:47,348
My father plans to come here.

394
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,982
Taro has driven him
from the First Castle.

395
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:54,657
My brother's letter says

396
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:59,225
Father has become so willful and erratic,
it would be unwise to let him stay.

397
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:04,595
He adds that Father's counselor, Ikoma,
has secretly shifted his allegiance.

398
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:25,219
It's quite unlike Lord Taro
to use such harsh language.

399
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:31,150
If I may, my lord,
why do you just sit quietly by?

400
00:39:31,362 --> 00:39:32,659
My question exactly.

401
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:36,924
You're the one who should
succeed Lord Hidetora.

402
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:40,570
Taro is no match for the task.

403
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:44,632
If we were you, we'd stake
our lives on a chance like this.

404
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:52,279
Are you saying
you'd stake your lives on me?

405
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:53,541
Exactly.

406
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:56,743
But dogs will abandon a master
who abandons the chase.

407
00:39:56,954 --> 00:39:59,422
Shrink from this
and you become our quarry.

408
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,054
How the dogs howl!

409
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,528
I have given the situation
much thought.

410
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,530
Just because
I was born a year after Taro,

411
00:40:12,736 --> 00:40:16,604
am I to grovel all my life
at his feet?

412
00:40:17,174 --> 00:40:18,641
I will throw off these shackles!

413
00:40:19,076 --> 00:40:20,907
Just what we wanted to hear.

414
00:40:21,111 --> 00:40:23,011
Control your impudence.

415
00:40:24,148 --> 00:40:25,513
Now listen.

416
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:29,678
Taro will be easy to handle,

417
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:33,118
but his wife, Lady Kaede,
is a different matter.

418
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:35,816
True.

419
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:39,919
Actually, she'd be
a perfect match for you.

420
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:44,197
Perhaps you should steal her.
- Don't be impertinent.

421
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:48,369
Our first concern is Father.

422
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:52,631
Though officially retired,
he still has 30 retainers -

423
00:40:52,977 --> 00:40:55,969
seasoned warriors,
each worth a thousand men.

424
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,443
He'll soon arrive at my gate
in their company.

425
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:04,248
We need a plan.

426
00:41:09,793 --> 00:41:11,385
<i>Open the gates!</i>

427
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:14,090
<i>It's Hidetora!</i>

428
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:19,194
The Great Lord is here!

429
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:51,164
I will see Sué first.

430
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:54,762
Tell Jiro I'll see him later.

431
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:22,959
Sué.

432
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:41,748
<i>Praise be</i>

433
00:42:41,985 --> 00:42:47,617
<i>To the eternal Western Paradise</i>

434
00:42:48,158 --> 00:42:52,527
<i>Praise be to the eternal Buddha</i>

435
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:56,529
<i>In 36 trillion manifestations</i>

436
00:42:56,733 --> 00:43:00,669
<i>Praise be to Amida Buddha</i>

437
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,240
I thought I'd find you here.

438
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:11,880
Father!

439
00:43:14,084 --> 00:43:16,052
Never mind the formalities.

440
00:43:17,154 --> 00:43:19,122
It's been a long time.

441
00:43:20,657 --> 00:43:22,386
Let me look at you.

442
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:28,354
Always that same sad face.

443
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,467
Every time I see you,
it tears at my heart.

444
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:46,612
It's worse
when you smile like that.

445
00:43:49,686 --> 00:43:52,052
I burned down
your father's castle.

446
00:43:52,256 --> 00:43:54,690
Your parents and family
all perished.

447
00:43:57,094 --> 00:43:59,494
How can you smile at me?

448
00:44:01,465 --> 00:44:03,490
You should be glaring at me
with hatred.

449
00:44:03,867 --> 00:44:06,995
That would be easier to bear.

450
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:12,134
Go on, let your hatred show!

451
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:21,814
I do not hate you.

452
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:27,749
Everything is determined
by our karma from previous lives.

453
00:44:28,992 --> 00:44:31,586
In all things I take comfort
in the Buddha's heart.

454
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:33,862
The Buddha again!

455
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,763
There is no Buddha in our world.
We live in a dark age

456
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:41,062
from which the Buddha's guardians
have been routed by the Asuras.

457
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:44,267
The Buddha's great mercy
can no longer help us.

458
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:47,668
Ah, Jiro!

459
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:51,212
I've come to be your guest.

460
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:58,151
I'm disappointed in Taro.
Let me tell you -

461
00:44:58,355 --> 00:45:02,792
There's no need, Father.
Taro explained everything in his letter.

462
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:06,229
Taro wrote to you?

463
00:45:08,031 --> 00:45:13,128
He says your guards
were vulgar and unruly.

464
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:16,636
I am to receive you
with the courtesy due my father,

465
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:22,039
but he orders me not to allow
your men inside the castle walls.

466
00:45:22,246 --> 00:45:23,736
That's absurd!

467
00:45:25,148 --> 00:45:27,309
How can I leave my men
to rot outside

468
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:30,247
while I alone enter the castle?

469
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:33,414
My brother is now
head of the clan.

470
00:45:33,624 --> 00:45:37,685
I have no choice
but to obey him.

471
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:41,297
If you cannot abide
by his conditions,

472
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:44,228
then perhaps your best course

473
00:45:44,434 --> 00:45:48,598
is to return to the First Castle
and apologize.

474
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:52,336
Apologize to Taro?

475
00:45:53,176 --> 00:45:55,110
Return to the First Castle?

476
00:46:23,106 --> 00:46:24,733
What's the meaning of this?

477
00:46:25,676 --> 00:46:27,906
This is outrageous!

478
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:29,677
Stop!

479
00:46:36,053 --> 00:46:38,647
Lord Kurogane!
Lord Shirane!

480
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:41,582
Why are we being
treated this way?

481
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:47,296
Lord Ikoma!

482
00:46:48,298 --> 00:46:50,232
These are
Lord Hidetora's instructions.

483
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:52,191
This sudden visit

484
00:46:53,136 --> 00:46:55,161
has caught
the castle unprepared.

485
00:46:55,372 --> 00:46:59,604
Wait outside the walls
until the castle is ready.

486
00:47:15,425 --> 00:47:17,052
I've heard enough.

487
00:47:18,495 --> 00:47:19,985
Now I see.

488
00:47:24,434 --> 00:47:25,901
You're no different...

489
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:29,671
from Taro.

490
00:47:32,843 --> 00:47:36,779
You just want me out of the way.

491
00:47:37,614 --> 00:47:39,377
That's not true.

492
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:43,075
Come alone and I'll welcome you
with open arms.

493
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:46,380
You only say that
because you know I can't.

494
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,620
You have stepped down.

495
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,827
Under your own son's protection,
what need can you have of retainers?

496
00:47:58,135 --> 00:48:00,330
Only the wild beasts...

497
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:04,630
can live without
the company of their own.

498
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:09,902
I've heard enough excuses.

499
00:48:13,049 --> 00:48:14,641
Open the gates!

500
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:21,824
What are you waiting for?

501
00:48:22,826 --> 00:48:24,657
Don't worry.

502
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:27,091
My men aren't coming in.

503
00:48:27,297 --> 00:48:29,390
I'm leaving!

504
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:33,292
Open the gates!

505
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,749
Close the gates!

506
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,723
I never want to see you again!

507
00:49:42,672 --> 00:49:45,004
The villages are all deserted.

508
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:48,837
There's not a grain of rice
to be had anywhere.

509
00:49:49,045 --> 00:49:53,038
The peasants must have taken it all
and fled to the hills.

510
00:50:33,757 --> 00:50:34,883
My lord.

511
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,521
The Third Castle
is our only choice.

512
00:50:40,263 --> 00:50:42,094
That was the first castle
you conquered.

513
00:50:42,299 --> 00:50:45,359
We can go there
and make a fresh -

514
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:46,695
Fool!

515
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:49,271
If I could do that,

516
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:53,039
I wouldn't be wandering
the wilderness without food.

517
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:56,538
Think a moment.

518
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:01,442
Would the protectors
of the Third Castle

519
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:05,345
welcome the man who banished
their lord and master?

520
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:49,896
By order of Lord Taro,

521
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,364
head of the Ichimonji clan,

522
00:51:53,103 --> 00:51:57,199
I have come to take possession
of this castle.

523
00:51:58,842 --> 00:52:00,434
Open the gates!

524
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:19,861
Without Lord Saburo,

525
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:22,189
this castle means nothing to us.

526
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:24,590
Our sole desire

527
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:28,769
is to follow Lord Saburo
and die protecting him.

528
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:33,638
Word has come that he is
in Lord Fujimaki's domain.

529
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:36,969
We go now to join him.

530
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,841
By your leave.

531
00:53:32,102 --> 00:53:33,535
<i>Lord Tango!</i>

532
00:53:36,806 --> 00:53:39,240
I've brought rice,
miso and salted plums.

533
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:48,744
I, Tango Hirayama,

534
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:51,380
though banished,
have followed my lord in disguise.

535
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:57,151
Seeing how you suffer,
I beg to offer you these provisions.

536
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:13,675
Is that really you, Tango?

537
00:54:16,746 --> 00:54:18,270
Wait!

538
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:21,382
Circumstances prevent us
from accepting these provisions.

539
00:54:21,918 --> 00:54:25,877
No matter how hungry, we will not
take charity from the peasants.

540
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:31,950
That's right.

541
00:54:32,162 --> 00:54:34,323
The peasants' conduct
is unforgivable.

542
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:37,932
Burn down all their villages!

543
00:54:39,769 --> 00:54:41,794
One moment, my lord!

544
00:54:42,038 --> 00:54:44,131
You mustn't blame the peasants.

545
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:49,442
Lord Taro forced them to flee
their villages and hide from you.

546
00:54:53,149 --> 00:54:55,310
What exactly did he do?

547
00:54:55,518 --> 00:54:57,577
He issued a decree
banishing you

548
00:54:57,787 --> 00:55:00,278
and declaring
that anyone who helps you...

549
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:03,883
must die.

550
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:46,602
You tried to warn me of this.

551
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:50,235
I should have taken it to heart.

552
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:52,707
I remain your humble servant,
my lord.

553
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:58,613
Go ahead and laugh, Tango.

554
00:56:00,783 --> 00:56:02,944
Laugh at Hidetora's
wretched plight.

555
00:56:06,122 --> 00:56:08,283
Betrayed by my own sons

556
00:56:09,092 --> 00:56:11,356
and turned out of my castles,

557
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:14,590
I have no place to go.

558
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:17,994
That's not true, my lord.
You do have a place to go.

559
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:20,125
Master Saburo

560
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:23,669
has found refuge with Lord Fujimaki,
who wants him for a son-in-law.

561
00:56:24,374 --> 00:56:26,239
Go to him.

562
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:30,204
No! Speak no more of that!

563
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:36,684
How could I ever face Saburo now?

564
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,055
My lord,
you must listen to me.

565
00:56:40,823 --> 00:56:44,418
Saburo's only thought
is for your welfare.

566
00:56:45,495 --> 00:56:48,123
It was at his bidding

567
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:50,492
that I followed you
disguised as I am.

568
00:56:51,067 --> 00:56:53,763
It was he who insisted

569
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:57,297
that I stay close by
and see to your safety.

570
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,199
I bring news, sire.

571
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:34,638
Saburo's men have turned over
the Third Castle to Lord Ogura

572
00:57:34,844 --> 00:57:38,109
and departed
for Lord Fujimaki's domain.

573
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:39,939
What?

574
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:44,216
Now we see
Lord Fujimaki's scheme.

575
00:57:44,721 --> 00:57:47,246
First he makes Master Saburo
his son-in-law,

576
00:57:47,457 --> 00:57:49,482
then he takes in
Saburo's warriors,

577
00:57:49,692 --> 00:57:51,592
and finally your lordship himself.

578
00:57:51,794 --> 00:57:55,252
Then he foments war
among your divided clan

579
00:57:55,798 --> 00:57:58,266
and walks off with your domain
while you battle it out.

580
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:01,926
That's absurd!
Lord Fujimaki is not that kind of man!

581
00:58:02,138 --> 00:58:05,767
We must go
to the Third Castle at once.

582
00:58:08,211 --> 00:58:11,112
But the castle
is in Lord Ogura's hands.

583
00:58:11,314 --> 00:58:14,010
What of it?
Ogura's a reasonable man.

584
00:58:14,217 --> 00:58:17,812
What's that I smell?
Something stinks.

585
00:58:18,654 --> 00:58:20,849
A very rotten stench.

586
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:24,620
My lord, Ogura has
only a handful of men.

587
00:58:25,395 --> 00:58:27,955
We can easily overwhelm them
if necessary.

588
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:30,596
Bring my horse!

589
00:58:32,035 --> 00:58:33,559
By all means hurry,

590
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:37,638
what with hell so near
and heaven so far!

591
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,137
Insolent brat!

592
00:58:39,342 --> 00:58:41,902
If you don't like it, begone!

593
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,591
All we did...

594
00:59:00,797 --> 00:59:03,960
was speak the truth.

595
01:01:02,351 --> 01:01:03,750
<i>My lord!</i>

596
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:07,381
- My lord, the attackers are -
- I know!

597
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:09,615
Find Ikoma and Ogura for me!

598
01:01:09,825 --> 01:01:12,089
But it's they
who've betrayed us!

599
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:16,595
The enemy is everywhere,
inside and out.

600
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:19,694
Hell is upon us!

601
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:45,281
Lord Taro is slain!

602
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:48,554
- What?
- A terrible shame!

603
01:07:49,325 --> 01:07:50,986
It was a stray shot
from the tower!

604
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:05,533
Such are the vagaries of war.

605
01:08:06,308 --> 01:08:09,004
The fates are kinder
to you than to Taro.

606
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:15,414
What about Father?

607
01:08:16,251 --> 01:08:17,809
Harakiri, most likely.

608
01:09:37,066 --> 01:09:40,263
- My lord, we're doomed!
- Prepare yourself!

609
01:09:40,736 --> 01:09:42,533
Farewell, my lord!

610
01:11:05,888 --> 01:11:07,378
Withdraw!

611
01:14:12,274 --> 01:14:13,639
My lord!

612
01:14:14,643 --> 01:14:17,111
The die is cast!
You must not falter!

613
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:19,939
You have but one path to follow.

614
01:14:20,615 --> 01:14:23,675
It leads to absolute rule
of the house of Ichimonji.

615
01:14:23,885 --> 01:14:26,547
There's no turning back.

616
01:15:29,784 --> 01:15:32,150
Lord Hidetora!

617
01:15:50,805 --> 01:15:52,966
My lord!

618
01:16:20,267 --> 01:16:21,791
Has he gone mad?

619
01:16:23,003 --> 01:16:24,334
He's better off for it!

620
01:16:24,572 --> 01:16:26,130
What are you saying?

621
01:16:26,674 --> 01:16:27,800
Please, my lord!

622
01:16:28,442 --> 01:16:29,841
You must reclaim your wits!

623
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:33,172
In a world gone mad,
it's madness to be sane.

624
01:16:48,662 --> 01:16:50,960
What on earth do you see?

625
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,425
Forgive me!

626
01:16:57,438 --> 01:16:58,928
Ah, excellent!

627
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,403
Your madness finally shows you
the true nature of your sins!

628
01:17:04,145 --> 01:17:08,639
<i>Oh, the unspeakable horror</i>

629
01:17:09,116 --> 01:17:12,745
<i>On a withered plain I see</i>

630
01:17:13,154 --> 01:17:16,817
<i>All those I destroyed</i>

631
01:17:17,024 --> 01:17:20,084
<i>In all the many clans</i>

632
01:17:21,896 --> 01:17:26,856
<i>Phantom armies rise up</i>

633
01:17:27,501 --> 01:17:30,493
<i>One by one before me</i>

634
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,683
<i>Who's there?</i>

635
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:52,585
Travelers stranded by the storm.

636
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,761
We beg shelter for the night.

637
01:17:56,697 --> 01:18:00,258
<i>My hovel is much too humble
for visitors.</i>

638
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:02,025
We ask nothing special.

639
01:18:04,038 --> 01:18:07,906
<i>I have reasons
for wishing to be alone.</i>

640
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:11,344
Why? A contagious malady?

641
01:18:12,613 --> 01:18:13,580
<i>No.</i>

642
01:18:13,781 --> 01:18:15,146
Then, please!

643
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,944
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

644
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,882
Listen.

645
01:18:21,088 --> 01:18:25,115
The one who seeks shelter
is Lord Ichimonji himself.

646
01:18:31,398 --> 01:18:33,093
We're coming in!

647
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:59,289
Our lord has taken ill.

648
01:19:02,429 --> 01:19:06,331
He's soaked to the bone.
Have you anything to cover him with?

649
01:19:37,798 --> 01:19:39,356
I'm cold.

650
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,090
My lord.

651
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:50,202
Is that you, Tango?

652
01:19:50,544 --> 01:19:54,537
Rejoice, Kyoami!
He's himself again.

653
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:58,040
More's the pity.

654
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:00,015
He was better off mad.

655
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,989
Listen to me.

656
01:20:10,064 --> 01:20:11,827
I was attacked...

657
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:17,931
by my own sons,
Taro and Jiro.

658
01:20:22,309 --> 01:20:24,573
And I was betrayed by Ikoma.

659
01:20:27,815 --> 01:20:29,908
Worse yet...

660
01:20:33,053 --> 01:20:35,385
I myself stood by and watched

661
01:20:35,856 --> 01:20:38,017
as my loyal followers
died in vain.

662
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,227
By some twist of fate...

663
01:20:43,263 --> 01:20:45,026
I came out of it alive.

664
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:48,026
I should have died!

665
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:02,911
You there! Woman!

666
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:08,746
I am not a woman.

667
01:21:09,723 --> 01:21:12,886
I'm sorry. It's so dark.
We need a light.

668
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,485
I have no light...

669
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:18,796
and no use for one.

670
01:21:19,066 --> 01:21:20,624
What?

671
01:21:20,868 --> 01:21:22,995
Are you without sight?

672
01:21:51,932 --> 01:21:54,958
Are you not Lady Sué's brother,

673
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:58,028
young Lord Tsurumaru?

674
01:22:04,611 --> 01:22:06,442
Tsurumaru?

675
01:22:11,585 --> 01:22:13,712
It's been a very long time...

676
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,319
Lord Hidetora.

677
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,885
You remember me?

678
01:22:24,131 --> 01:22:26,122
How could I forget?

679
01:22:28,469 --> 01:22:30,437
I may have been only a boy,

680
01:22:30,637 --> 01:22:33,265
but never could I forget
the man

681
01:22:33,474 --> 01:22:35,669
who burned down
my father's castle

682
01:22:35,876 --> 01:22:38,276
and gouged out my eyes...

683
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:42,107
as the price
for letting me live.

684
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:47,546
My sister taught me

685
01:22:48,455 --> 01:22:50,423
to pray to the Buddha

686
01:22:50,624 --> 01:22:54,151
and banish hatred from my heart,
but try as I might...

687
01:22:57,164 --> 01:22:59,724
not for one day
have I forgotten...

688
01:23:01,802 --> 01:23:04,862
not one night
have I slept in peace.

689
01:23:13,247 --> 01:23:14,942
Now then,

690
01:23:15,182 --> 01:23:19,551
I regret I cannot show you
the hospitality

691
01:23:19,753 --> 01:23:22,187
befitting a great lord.

692
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:27,822
But I have a flute
my sister gave me.

693
01:23:33,433 --> 01:23:35,731
Perhaps I might play
a tune for you

694
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:40,095
in place of the hospitality

695
01:23:40,707 --> 01:23:42,698
I'm unable to offer.

696
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:48,376
This is the only pleasure

697
01:23:49,449 --> 01:23:51,110
that remains for me now.

698
01:25:15,836 --> 01:25:17,804
My lord!

699
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,333
Lady Kaede,

700
01:25:22,542 --> 01:25:24,635
I bring a lock
of your husband's hair.

701
01:25:34,388 --> 01:25:37,880
Unhappily it falls to me

702
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:40,150
to inform you
of his death in battle.

703
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:43,286
I curse the fates that made it so.

704
01:25:46,366 --> 01:25:47,833
Lord Ogura...

705
01:25:49,569 --> 01:25:51,901
where are
my husband's remains?

706
01:25:53,373 --> 01:25:55,432
In this fierce heat,

707
01:25:55,642 --> 01:25:59,203
the body would have become
too unsightly for you to view.

708
01:26:00,147 --> 01:26:02,741
We cremated it
at the Third Castle

709
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:05,884
and held funeral rites
at a nearby temple.

710
01:26:06,086 --> 01:26:07,986
Lord Ogura,

711
01:26:08,188 --> 01:26:10,486
where are his armor and helmet?

712
01:26:11,024 --> 01:26:12,616
Do you mock me?

713
01:26:13,493 --> 01:26:15,961
I'm now wearing
the armor he wore.

714
01:26:16,163 --> 01:26:19,428
Surely you recognize it.

715
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:23,561
Of course.

716
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:27,231
I just couldn't believe

717
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:32,944
you'd so quickly claim
these mementos of my husband...

718
01:26:34,514 --> 01:26:36,414
for yourself to wear.

719
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,544
I'm stung by your words.

720
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:46,092
I thought my brother would be pleased
to see me return to his castle

721
01:26:46,293 --> 01:26:48,158
wearing his armor.

722
01:26:48,528 --> 01:26:51,759
But I see it was
a rash decision.

723
01:26:52,799 --> 01:26:54,232
Forgive me.

724
01:26:58,438 --> 01:27:01,202
Help me remove this armor!

725
01:27:05,045 --> 01:27:06,307
Lady Kaede,

726
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:08,743
forgive my disrobing before you.

727
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,979
Lords Ikoma and Ogura,
you've been of great service to us

728
01:27:48,188 --> 01:27:51,248
during these upheavals
in the house of Ichimonji.

729
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:56,960
Please accept these humble tokens
as an expression of our gratitude.

730
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:07,900
These are
my parting gifts to you.

731
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,173
Farewell.

732
01:28:11,778 --> 01:28:13,973
After careful consideration,

733
01:28:14,181 --> 01:28:17,776
Lord Jiro feels it unwise
to take into his service

734
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:21,349
men who betrayed their masters
while serving as their counselors.

735
01:28:22,189 --> 01:28:24,384
His reasoning is unassailable.

736
01:28:24,624 --> 01:28:27,354
We are helpless to intervene.

737
01:28:27,561 --> 01:28:29,654
Please do not be offended.

738
01:28:29,863 --> 01:28:32,093
You do understand?
I'm so glad.

739
01:28:32,299 --> 01:28:34,267
If you'll excuse us, my lord.

740
01:28:44,377 --> 01:28:47,471
<i>Lady Kaede is here, sire.</i>

741
01:28:51,918 --> 01:28:53,146
Ask her to ascend.

742
01:29:57,584 --> 01:30:02,112
I'm afraid I was upset before
and spoke indiscreetly.

743
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:04,422
I must apologize.

744
01:30:04,624 --> 01:30:08,287
Please think nothing of it.

745
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:17,734
They say your father
has gone mad.

746
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:25,845
That must please you.

747
01:30:26,179 --> 01:30:28,613
Why would you say
such a thing?

748
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:30,914
Lady Kaede,

749
01:30:31,117 --> 01:30:34,211
I merely spoke what I felt
was the ungilded truth.

750
01:30:34,454 --> 01:30:36,581
Forgive me
if I've caused offense.

751
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:40,617
But you must hate
my father fiercely

752
01:30:40,827 --> 01:30:43,990
for what he did to your family.

753
01:30:44,197 --> 01:30:45,596
Or am I mistaken?

754
01:30:48,969 --> 01:30:51,631
I could say much the same:

755
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:55,431
Lord Jiro too must be
most pleased.

756
01:30:57,243 --> 01:31:01,441
After all, you are now head
of the Ichimonji clan.

757
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:17,129
This helmet is rightfully yours.

758
01:31:31,911 --> 01:31:35,074
I'm not blind, Lord Jiro!

759
01:31:35,348 --> 01:31:39,148
You drove your father mad, murdered
your brother and stole his lands!

760
01:31:39,352 --> 01:31:40,910
This is for my husband!

761
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:42,247
You're wrong!

762
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:44,480
You deny it even now?

763
01:31:47,327 --> 01:31:49,591
It wasn't me!
I didn't kill my brother!

764
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,388
Then who did?

765
01:31:52,732 --> 01:31:55,724
Speak! Who was it?

766
01:32:01,674 --> 01:32:04,165
- Who was it?
- It wasn't me.

767
01:32:07,047 --> 01:32:08,912
Kurogane shot him.

768
01:32:09,115 --> 01:32:10,776
Hypocrite!

769
01:32:11,284 --> 01:32:14,310
Would you give the order,
then deny the blame?

770
01:32:15,722 --> 01:32:17,485
A fine leader you are!

771
01:32:29,569 --> 01:32:31,434
You contemptible weakling.

772
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:58,754
Now it's my turn to speak
the ungilded truth.

773
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:14,107
Lord Jiro,

774
01:33:14,848 --> 01:33:19,683
I couldn't care less
about my husband's death.

775
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:23,048
All I care about

776
01:33:23,656 --> 01:33:25,385
is myself!

777
01:33:27,193 --> 01:33:29,923
I refuse to live as a widow,
with my hair cut short,

778
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:32,997
or as a nun,
with my head shaved.

779
01:33:33,766 --> 01:33:36,166
This castle was my father's.

780
01:33:36,369 --> 01:33:38,098
I will not be driven from it!

781
01:33:45,378 --> 01:33:46,970
Lord Jiro,

782
01:33:47,514 --> 01:33:49,812
if you'll grant my request,

783
01:33:50,717 --> 01:33:53,049
I will say nothing.

784
01:33:53,653 --> 01:33:57,316
I'll tell no one
of your abominable crimes.

785
01:33:59,025 --> 01:34:03,018
I'll not speak out
in bitter reproach against you.

786
01:34:03,663 --> 01:34:07,292
If I did, I could throw
this land into turmoil!

787
01:34:08,801 --> 01:34:10,496
It's in my power...

788
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:16,108
to tear this domain to shreds!

789
01:34:22,482 --> 01:34:25,178
What do you say, Lord Jiro?

790
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:10,512
My... lord?

791
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:14,617
Yes, Lady Kaede?

792
01:36:14,827 --> 01:36:16,385
I didn't hear that.

793
01:36:16,596 --> 01:36:18,996
How can you still be
so formal with me?

794
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:23,158
After what we've done,

795
01:36:24,103 --> 01:36:26,298
I really should be...

796
01:36:27,473 --> 01:36:28,963
your wife.

797
01:36:38,318 --> 01:36:41,014
But I already have Sué.

798
01:36:42,322 --> 01:36:44,483
Then am I to be
merely your concubine?

799
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:49,051
No!

800
01:36:51,731 --> 01:36:53,790
You must belong to me alone.

801
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,566
No one else can have you!

802
01:37:33,539 --> 01:37:35,302
You needn't cry, Kaede.

803
01:37:35,875 --> 01:37:38,810
I'd never make you
a mere concubine.

804
01:37:39,445 --> 01:37:42,937
But as long
as Lady Sué remains -

805
01:37:44,117 --> 01:37:46,278
I'll think of something.

806
01:37:46,786 --> 01:37:48,583
What can you do?

807
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:52,321
I'll divorce her.

808
01:37:53,059 --> 01:37:54,924
That will not do!

809
01:37:55,762 --> 01:37:59,960
I can't bear to think

810
01:38:00,199 --> 01:38:02,224
that another woman
has known your touch.

811
01:38:03,035 --> 01:38:06,300
She can't be allowed to live!

812
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:19,514
Do you know where we are?

813
01:38:21,487 --> 01:38:25,253
In more peaceful times, this would
have been Tsurumaru's castle.

814
01:38:27,126 --> 01:38:29,890
You now take shelter
in the ruins of a castle

815
01:38:30,096 --> 01:38:31,961
that you yourself burned down.

816
01:38:37,804 --> 01:38:40,967
Must be nice
having no idea what's happening.

817
01:39:23,316 --> 01:39:24,908
Your helmet, my lord.

818
01:39:50,810 --> 01:39:52,778
And those are your crest.

819
01:39:54,313 --> 01:39:56,406
Now you look even more grand.

820
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:31,013
Look who's coming -
those demons!

821
01:40:31,684 --> 01:40:33,276
Two demons approaching!

822
01:40:46,632 --> 01:40:50,124
Dirty traitors!
You'll pay for your treason!

823
01:40:50,736 --> 01:40:52,294
No, wait!

824
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:53,597
Let us explain!

825
01:40:53,806 --> 01:40:55,398
Excuses won't save you!

826
01:40:55,608 --> 01:40:59,135
Lord Hidetora told me
all about your treachery.

827
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:24,730
My lord!

828
01:41:44,323 --> 01:41:46,416
Die, traitor!

829
01:41:48,294 --> 01:41:49,818
Jiro killed Taro!

830
01:41:50,696 --> 01:41:52,687
If Hidetora hadn't gone mad,

831
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:55,963
he'd have been next!

832
01:41:56,168 --> 01:41:58,636
If he recovers his wits,
he'll be killed too!

833
01:42:17,123 --> 01:42:19,591
Jiro killed Taro!

834
01:42:19,792 --> 01:42:22,260
We must take Lord Hidetora
to Saburo at once!

835
01:42:22,695 --> 01:42:24,890
If only we could.

836
01:42:25,665 --> 01:42:28,998
Mention Saburo
and he runs away.

837
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:33,368
He can't bring himself
to face Saburo after what happened.

838
01:42:33,572 --> 01:42:35,403
On that point he's sane.

839
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:37,166
My lord.

840
01:42:39,345 --> 01:42:41,745
Why do you shrink
from Master Saburo?

841
01:42:44,417 --> 01:42:47,580
Let us go to him.

842
01:42:55,594 --> 01:42:58,893
No, our only choice
is to bring Saburo here.

843
01:42:59,098 --> 01:43:01,259
I'll go get him.

844
01:43:01,734 --> 01:43:04,897
I'll return as soon as I can.

845
01:43:06,205 --> 01:43:08,332
I leave our lord in your hands.

846
01:43:39,438 --> 01:43:40,962
My lord,

847
01:43:41,941 --> 01:43:45,138
you're allowing Lady Kaede
to lead you by the nose.

848
01:43:48,981 --> 01:43:51,814
If you wish to marry her, fine.

849
01:43:52,384 --> 01:43:55,581
But to kill Lady Sué?

850
01:43:57,490 --> 01:44:00,721
Sometimes it is necessary
to take a life,

851
01:44:00,926 --> 01:44:03,861
but to kill one
who needn't be killed -

852
01:44:05,064 --> 01:44:08,556
I'll have nothing to do
with such lunacy!

853
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:35,326
Lord Kurogane.

854
01:44:36,495 --> 01:44:39,953
I trust the Second Castle
has ample stores of salt?

855
01:44:42,735 --> 01:44:44,202
Yes. Why?

856
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:48,298
You'll need to bring
the head back wrapped in salt.

857
01:44:48,541 --> 01:44:50,475
Otherwise, in this heat,

858
01:44:50,676 --> 01:44:55,670
it'll be in such a frightful state,
we'll have to cover our eyes.

859
01:44:57,483 --> 01:45:00,077
For a woman
of Lady Sué's beauty,

860
01:45:00,286 --> 01:45:02,777
that would be too cruel.

861
01:45:03,489 --> 01:45:07,755
Since you will see to it personally,
I'm sure there will be no mishaps.

862
01:45:09,328 --> 01:45:11,353
I leave it
in your capable hands.

863
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:40,087
Why do I stay
with this crazy old man?

864
01:45:42,027 --> 01:45:44,461
If the boulder you're sitting on
begins to roll,

865
01:45:45,231 --> 01:45:47,290
you'd best jump clear.

866
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:58,433
Otherwise you'll be crushed.

867
01:46:12,057 --> 01:46:14,082
Only a fool refuses to jump.

868
01:46:16,061 --> 01:46:17,961
This place -

869
01:46:18,898 --> 01:46:20,593
Where are we?

870
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:38,179
We're in paradise!

871
01:46:59,905 --> 01:47:01,634
Damn it all!

872
01:47:03,275 --> 01:47:05,175
Ever since I was a child,

873
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:09,373
I've been tending to him.

874
01:47:28,667 --> 01:47:30,225
Now be a good boy.

875
01:47:34,974 --> 01:47:36,669
Time for beddy-bye.

876
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:26,682
I have returned, my lord!

877
01:48:49,248 --> 01:48:50,442
Approach!

878
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,871
You have been most diligent.

879
01:49:25,117 --> 01:49:26,880
At your service, my lady.

880
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:32,979
In accordance
with your careful instructions,

881
01:49:33,192 --> 01:49:36,184
I have brought
the item you requested.

882
01:49:40,332 --> 01:49:42,766
Be so kind as to examine it.

883
01:49:53,812 --> 01:49:57,407
With your permission,
I will inspect it first.

884
01:50:25,811 --> 01:50:27,278
What is this?

885
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:31,010
Is this some kind of a joke?

886
01:50:31,216 --> 01:50:33,343
- Is something wrong?
- I'll not have it!

887
01:50:36,355 --> 01:50:38,118
What in the world?

888
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:42,352
Lady Sué must have been
a fox in disguise.

889
01:50:42,561 --> 01:50:44,620
Enough of your pranks!

890
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:46,889
This is a statue from a shrine!

891
01:50:51,603 --> 01:50:54,436
A clever fox indeed!

892
01:50:55,574 --> 01:50:57,735
Now she's turned herself
to stone!

893
01:50:58,076 --> 01:50:59,873
Kurogane!

894
01:51:02,147 --> 01:51:04,411
Would you make a fool of me?

895
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:06,774
Heavens, no.

896
01:51:06,985 --> 01:51:09,510
We have a great many foxes
in these parts,

897
01:51:09,721 --> 01:51:12,747
and it's said
they often play tricks on humans.

898
01:51:16,628 --> 01:51:19,062
You must be very careful,
my lord.

899
01:51:19,264 --> 01:51:23,098
Foxes often work their evil
in the shape of a woman.

900
01:51:23,302 --> 01:51:27,432
In Central Asia,
a she-fox seduced King Pan Tsu

901
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:30,297
and persuaded him
to kill a thousand men.

902
01:51:30,509 --> 01:51:35,378
In China, a she-fox became King Yu's
queen and brought down his kingdom.

903
01:51:35,581 --> 01:51:37,572
Here in Japan,
a white fox with nine tails

904
01:51:37,783 --> 01:51:41,446
caused great havoc in court
as Princess Tamamo,

905
01:51:41,653 --> 01:51:45,214
before reverting back
to her true form.

906
01:51:46,325 --> 01:51:50,557
They lost track of the white fox
after that,

907
01:51:50,762 --> 01:51:53,060
but it's been suggested

908
01:51:53,265 --> 01:51:56,029
she may have settled
in this area.

909
01:51:57,202 --> 01:51:59,727
So beware, my lord, beware.

910
01:52:00,372 --> 01:52:02,033
With your permission.

911
01:52:14,853 --> 01:52:19,881
I make one small request,
and this is how you respond?

912
01:52:20,092 --> 01:52:21,957
How could you do this?

913
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:24,025
You conspired with Kurogane
to humiliate me!

914
01:52:24,229 --> 01:52:26,026
No, you're mistaken!

915
01:52:26,265 --> 01:52:27,459
I won't hear it!

916
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:30,433
Stop, Kaede!
This was all Kurogane's doing!

917
01:52:35,774 --> 01:52:37,833
It's always Kurogane.

918
01:52:38,577 --> 01:52:40,738
Is that man your only vassal?

919
01:52:42,014 --> 01:52:44,414
First he plays the villain
by killing Taro,

920
01:52:44,616 --> 01:52:47,414
then he plays the hero
by saving Sué.

921
01:52:47,619 --> 01:52:49,746
And to think
this two-headed monster

922
01:52:49,955 --> 01:52:51,855
is your right-hand man!

923
01:52:52,924 --> 01:52:56,553
Until I have Sué's head,

924
01:52:56,762 --> 01:52:58,696
you'll not see me again!

925
01:53:15,213 --> 01:53:17,511
Sister, I forgot my flute.

926
01:53:17,716 --> 01:53:19,183
There's no time now.

927
01:53:19,384 --> 01:53:20,976
But I've treasured it
since I was little.

928
01:53:21,186 --> 01:53:22,983
What can we do?

929
01:53:23,188 --> 01:53:25,952
Lord Kurogane said
your pursuers would be close behind.

930
01:53:26,224 --> 01:53:28,283
I'll go back for it.

931
01:53:28,593 --> 01:53:31,960
Your legs are weak.
I should be the one.

932
01:53:32,164 --> 01:53:34,826
No, we're almost to the ruins
of your family's castle.

933
01:53:35,033 --> 01:53:38,628
This is your only chance
to pray for your dead.

934
01:53:38,837 --> 01:53:42,068
Once you escape from here,
you might never return.

935
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,844
Come, Tsurumaru.
Let us hurry.

936
01:53:57,055 --> 01:53:59,649
There it is, Tsurumaru!

937
01:53:59,858 --> 01:54:02,224
Our castle... what's left of it.

938
01:54:02,427 --> 01:54:03,951
Where, Sué?

939
01:54:04,162 --> 01:54:05,527
Over there.

940
01:54:11,370 --> 01:54:12,632
Where is it?

941
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:02,810
Heaven and earth
have gone topsy-turvy.

942
01:55:03,321 --> 01:55:05,949
I was once the fool
who made him laugh.

943
01:55:06,658 --> 01:55:09,718
Now he's the fool,
and I'm the one laughing.

944
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:15,388
Don't just stand there.
Say something.

945
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:19,830
Blabber your nonsense
and I'll speak my truth...

946
01:55:21,139 --> 01:55:24,302
and we'll have a good laugh
comparing the two.

947
01:55:27,612 --> 01:55:30,080
Come on, old man!

948
01:55:41,827 --> 01:55:44,489
A serpent once had an egg
pure and white,

949
01:55:45,197 --> 01:55:47,961
while that of a bird
was speckled and dirty.

950
01:55:48,166 --> 01:55:50,293
This must be a castle.

951
01:55:52,437 --> 01:55:53,961
This is a stone wall.

952
01:55:54,172 --> 01:55:57,369
The bird gave up the speckled egg
to lay on the white one.

953
01:55:58,443 --> 01:55:59,535
This is strange.

954
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:01,871
The egg cracked open
and out came a snake.

955
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:05,140
Nothing but empty space
above the walls.

956
01:56:06,017 --> 01:56:07,382
Why is that?

957
01:56:07,586 --> 01:56:09,918
The bird was eaten
by the snake it hatched.

958
01:56:16,761 --> 01:56:18,490
What is this place?

959
01:56:21,833 --> 01:56:23,528
Who am I?

960
01:56:23,735 --> 01:56:25,498
You're a stupid bird!

961
01:56:29,541 --> 01:56:31,065
Saburo.

962
01:56:38,783 --> 01:56:41,308
The pain!

963
01:56:43,788 --> 01:56:47,019
I'm a worm.
Don't crush me.

964
01:56:48,326 --> 01:56:52,592
Crush you? Who'd bother
to crush a worm like you?

965
01:56:56,935 --> 01:56:59,995
Who are you?

966
01:57:24,162 --> 01:57:25,857
Someone's crying.

967
01:57:30,869 --> 01:57:32,894
Who could it be?

968
01:57:34,806 --> 01:57:36,569
Damn it!

969
01:57:36,808 --> 01:57:38,708
Man is born crying.

970
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:41,208
He cries and cries,
and then he dies!

971
01:59:14,305 --> 01:59:16,967
My lord,
Saburo has crossed the river

972
01:59:17,175 --> 01:59:18,733
and taken up a position
in Hachiman Field.

973
01:59:18,977 --> 01:59:22,970
That's odd. What does he hope
to do with so few men?

974
01:59:27,085 --> 01:59:29,781
- A messenger has come from Saburo.
- What?

975
01:59:30,088 --> 01:59:31,180
His message?

976
01:59:31,389 --> 01:59:33,584
Saburo has come
for your father.

977
01:59:34,893 --> 01:59:37,555
He will withdraw
as soon as he has him.

978
01:59:37,762 --> 01:59:39,559
<i>My lord!</i>

979
01:59:42,167 --> 01:59:44,101
Lord Fujimaki is at the border.

980
01:59:58,049 --> 01:59:59,710
I don't like this.

981
01:59:59,918 --> 02:00:02,682
I told Lord Fujimaki
I didn't want him here.

982
02:00:02,987 --> 02:00:04,852
There's nothing to fear.

983
02:00:05,056 --> 02:00:09,493
With him up there, the enemy
will be pinned down once they arrive.

984
02:00:09,694 --> 02:00:13,960
Meanwhile, we can safely fetch
your father from Azusano.

985
02:00:14,766 --> 02:00:18,224
But it's such
a massive show of force.

986
02:00:18,603 --> 02:00:22,562
One false move could mean war.

987
02:00:30,181 --> 02:00:32,581
Was it hasty of me to come?

988
02:00:33,551 --> 02:00:36,145
I came because I couldn't
just sit by and watch,

989
02:00:36,354 --> 02:00:38,720
though Saburo will surely
be angry with me.

990
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:43,784
As long as we stay right here,
he shouldn't object.

991
02:00:57,041 --> 02:00:59,202
Prepare to march!

992
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:05,208
My lord, this is not
the time to fight.

993
02:01:05,416 --> 02:01:08,112
Tell Saburo
he can have your father.

994
02:01:08,319 --> 02:01:10,082
Don't start a war.

995
02:01:10,522 --> 02:01:12,717
I can't let him have Father.

996
02:01:12,924 --> 02:01:17,918
Together they will accuse me
of treason and attack me.

997
02:01:18,830 --> 02:01:23,460
Even if we wanted to turn over
your father, we don't know where he is.

998
02:01:23,668 --> 02:01:26,603
Recent events have thrown
the whole domain into turmoil,

999
02:01:26,805 --> 02:01:29,672
and Fujimaki and Ayabe
are looking for an opening.

1000
02:01:29,941 --> 02:01:34,002
We should be securing our bulwarks,
not marching into battle.

1001
02:01:35,547 --> 02:01:37,310
<i>My lord,</i>

1002
02:01:37,649 --> 02:01:39,810
I bring a message
from Lady Kaede.

1003
02:01:41,452 --> 02:01:45,252
She awaits you with sake
to celebrate your departure for battle.

1004
02:01:48,393 --> 02:01:52,659
A warrior riding into battle
mustn't leave his heart with a woman.

1005
02:01:52,931 --> 02:01:54,660
You must refrain.

1006
02:02:21,159 --> 02:02:23,252
The enemy approaches.
As soon as they're here,

1007
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:25,827
we'll slip through those woods
to find his lordship.

1008
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:28,999
Be patient.
Koyata, rest the horses.

1009
02:02:30,235 --> 02:02:31,930
Dismount!

1010
02:02:33,671 --> 02:02:35,161
<i>Fool!</i>

1011
02:02:38,843 --> 02:02:41,505
You're letting Kurogane
sway you again.

1012
02:02:42,146 --> 02:02:43,477
You're wrong!

1013
02:02:43,748 --> 02:02:45,375
To fight now
is not in our favor.

1014
02:02:45,583 --> 02:02:48,484
The leader's prowess
determines victory or defeat.

1015
02:02:48,686 --> 02:02:51,382
You have nothing to fear
from Fujimaki or Ayabe.

1016
02:02:55,159 --> 02:02:56,683
Your mistake

1017
02:02:57,362 --> 02:03:01,458
was sparing your father
just because he went mad.

1018
02:03:03,434 --> 02:03:06,494
But how can I kill him
if I don't know where he is?

1019
02:03:09,407 --> 02:03:12,308
I'm sure Saburo
knows where to find him.

1020
02:03:13,711 --> 02:03:17,306
Why else would he have come?

1021
02:03:23,955 --> 02:03:25,718
All you need do

1022
02:03:26,858 --> 02:03:31,557
is send a messenger to Saburo
saying he can take your father,

1023
02:03:32,297 --> 02:03:36,893
then dispatch your assassins
to follow him.

1024
02:03:53,151 --> 02:03:55,346
I've lost my way.

1025
02:03:55,753 --> 02:03:57,812
All men lose their way.

1026
02:04:01,859 --> 02:04:03,520
This path...

1027
02:04:05,063 --> 02:04:06,758
Looks familiar.

1028
02:04:07,632 --> 02:04:09,759
I've come this way before.

1029
02:04:09,968 --> 02:04:12,732
Men have been wandering
the same paths forever.

1030
02:04:13,604 --> 02:04:16,004
If you don't like it, then jump!

1031
02:04:30,722 --> 02:04:33,156
My lord!

1032
02:05:05,590 --> 02:05:07,114
Up there.

1033
02:05:07,692 --> 02:05:09,421
Who is that?

1034
02:05:11,596 --> 02:05:12,790
Sué!

1035
02:05:21,339 --> 02:05:23,432
Sister, whose voice was that?

1036
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:27,168
This was her father's castle.

1037
02:05:28,413 --> 02:05:30,745
These are the ruins of the castle

1038
02:05:31,616 --> 02:05:33,550
that I burned down.

1039
02:05:36,354 --> 02:05:38,219
Why am I here?

1040
02:05:40,958 --> 02:05:42,949
Why is Sué here?

1041
02:05:44,962 --> 02:05:46,486
And Tsurumaru too!

1042
02:05:52,003 --> 02:05:53,630
Is this a dream?

1043
02:05:54,205 --> 02:05:56,605
No, this must be hell!

1044
02:05:57,141 --> 02:05:58,631
I'm in hell!

1045
02:05:58,976 --> 02:06:01,001
I'm in the depths of hell!

1046
02:08:01,799 --> 02:08:03,130
Mount!

1047
02:09:57,448 --> 02:09:59,848
A message from Lord Jiro!

1048
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:23,873
Agreed.

1049
02:10:34,952 --> 02:10:36,749
He says they won't stand
in our way.

1050
02:10:36,954 --> 02:10:40,117
We're to take Father
and leave promptly.

1051
02:10:41,258 --> 02:10:43,726
Let us go at once.

1052
02:10:43,928 --> 02:10:48,490
No. We mustn't
reveal his whereabouts.

1053
02:10:48,699 --> 02:10:51,065
We'll wait until dark.
- My lord.

1054
02:10:51,268 --> 02:10:53,566
Ayabe's forces are massing
on that ridge.

1055
02:11:23,167 --> 02:11:26,261
The vulture!
He smells blood.

1056
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:41,718
Remain calm, my lord.

1057
02:11:42,853 --> 02:11:44,514
On that ridge we have Ayabe.

1058
02:11:45,823 --> 02:11:48,849
On the other,
Fujimaki awaits his chance.

1059
02:11:53,964 --> 02:11:56,296
This is the moment of truth.

1060
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:59,697
We must stand firm
and give them no excuse to attack.

1061
02:12:01,005 --> 02:12:05,135
He came to take Father,
yet he makes no move.

1062
02:12:05,342 --> 02:12:07,833
What's his plan?

1063
02:12:27,131 --> 02:12:29,099
Why is she taking so long?

1064
02:12:32,903 --> 02:12:36,202
I'll see what's keeping her.

1065
02:12:36,407 --> 02:12:37,897
No.

1066
02:12:38,509 --> 02:12:40,636
No, I don't need the flute.

1067
02:12:40,845 --> 02:12:43,370
You're acting like a child.

1068
02:12:43,747 --> 02:12:47,274
Sister, I don't ever want
to be alone again.

1069
02:12:48,185 --> 02:12:50,551
You won't be alone.

1070
02:12:57,695 --> 02:13:00,255
On this scroll is an image
of Amida Buddha.

1071
02:13:00,464 --> 02:13:03,433
It will protect you in my absence.

1072
02:13:05,135 --> 02:13:06,466
Sister!

1073
02:13:07,838 --> 02:13:10,568
I won't be gone long.

1074
02:13:11,609 --> 02:13:12,940
Sister!

1075
02:13:17,414 --> 02:13:19,609
My lord!

1076
02:13:30,895 --> 02:13:32,726
My lord!

1077
02:13:34,098 --> 02:13:38,398
I found Kyoami
in tears at Azusano.

1078
02:13:38,602 --> 02:13:41,002
Kyoami,
where's Lord Hidetora?

1079
02:13:42,673 --> 02:13:44,641
Forgive me!

1080
02:13:45,242 --> 02:13:49,144
I lost him.

1081
02:13:50,548 --> 02:13:54,245
You last saw my father
at Azusano?

1082
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:58,548
We can no longer wait for dark.

1083
02:13:58,756 --> 02:14:00,383
Koyata!

1084
02:14:05,663 --> 02:14:10,362
Tango and I are going to Azusano.
Keep the enemy engaged here.

1085
02:14:11,302 --> 02:14:14,533
Ten of you
go with Lord Saburo!

1086
02:14:28,752 --> 02:14:30,447
They're on the move.

1087
02:14:31,622 --> 02:14:36,116
A detachment headed for Azusano,
with Saburo in the lead.

1088
02:14:38,295 --> 02:14:40,286
Gunnery captain!

1089
02:14:46,437 --> 02:14:48,735
Take your men to Azusano

1090
02:14:48,939 --> 02:14:51,032
and lay an ambush.

1091
02:14:52,042 --> 02:14:55,307
Whoever kills Saburo
will be the hero of this battle!

1092
02:14:55,846 --> 02:14:57,313
This is insanity!

1093
02:14:57,514 --> 02:15:00,244
Break your word
and it will mean war!

1094
02:15:00,951 --> 02:15:04,352
So be it.
It has to happen sometime.

1095
02:15:04,555 --> 02:15:08,548
- We'll have to fight the others too.
- What of it?

1096
02:15:09,159 --> 02:15:12,754
If Ayabe and Fujimaki
violate our borders,

1097
02:15:13,063 --> 02:15:17,500
we'll rout their forces
and make their lands our own!

1098
02:15:17,701 --> 02:15:21,296
Brave words,
but words don't win wars.

1099
02:15:21,505 --> 02:15:24,599
What happened to the man
who rebuked me for timidity?

1100
02:15:24,808 --> 02:15:29,074
Kaede was right.
You play the villain, but you're gutless!

1101
02:15:30,781 --> 02:15:33,272
Under her spell yet again?

1102
02:15:33,517 --> 02:15:35,212
Silence!

1103
02:15:35,419 --> 02:15:36,716
If you're opposed,
stay behind!

1104
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:40,253
If you fear the fight,
then begone!

1105
02:15:41,025 --> 02:15:42,549
My lord!

1106
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:45,751
How could I leave you, my lord?

1107
02:15:45,963 --> 02:15:47,590
Where would I go?

1108
02:15:49,633 --> 02:15:53,034
You have your orders, Captain!
Go!

1109
02:16:05,416 --> 02:16:06,940
Runner!

1110
02:16:08,052 --> 02:16:10,043
Take this message to Lord Saburo:

1111
02:16:10,254 --> 02:16:13,883
"Enemy gunners are on the way.
Be on guard."

1112
02:16:20,764 --> 02:16:22,493
Infantry...

1113
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:25,193
forward!

1114
02:16:39,083 --> 02:16:40,983
He thinks he's clever.

1115
02:16:51,695 --> 02:16:53,094
All forces...

1116
02:16:54,031 --> 02:16:58,434
move into the woods!

1117
02:16:59,036 --> 02:17:00,936
Right face!

1118
02:17:02,673 --> 02:17:04,766
Forward!

1119
02:17:07,211 --> 02:17:10,112
Lord Saburo!

1120
02:17:31,268 --> 02:17:33,736
- Father!
- Lord Hidetora!

1121
02:17:34,471 --> 02:17:35,938
Father!

1122
02:17:38,208 --> 02:17:39,732
My lord!

1123
02:18:20,484 --> 02:18:22,918
Look at that sky!

1124
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:28,451
Is this the other world?

1125
02:18:32,863 --> 02:18:34,831
Am I in paradise?

1126
02:18:37,467 --> 02:18:38,434
Father!

1127
02:18:38,635 --> 02:18:41,729
How can you be so cruel?

1128
02:18:42,206 --> 02:18:45,664
Why do you drag me
from my grave?

1129
02:18:47,711 --> 02:18:50,009
Father!

1130
02:18:54,284 --> 02:18:56,844
Don't you know me, Father?

1131
02:18:57,988 --> 02:18:59,512
Father!

1132
02:19:03,794 --> 02:19:05,386
Father?

1133
02:19:08,999 --> 02:19:11,627
Who are you calling father?

1134
02:19:14,972 --> 02:19:17,372
Wait. I remember now.

1135
02:19:20,777 --> 02:19:23,803
I had three sons.

1136
02:19:31,555 --> 02:19:33,819
Are you one of them?

1137
02:19:34,024 --> 02:19:36,652
Yes. I am Saburo.

1138
02:19:50,474 --> 02:19:53,739
- Saburo! Is it really you?
- Father!

1139
02:20:01,685 --> 02:20:05,644
I have no face to show you,

1140
02:20:06,256 --> 02:20:08,315
no words to excuse myself.

1141
02:20:09,159 --> 02:20:13,323
If you have poison for me,

1142
02:20:13,597 --> 02:20:15,588
I will drink it.

1143
02:20:16,767 --> 02:20:18,758
You mustn't talk like that.

1144
02:20:18,969 --> 02:20:21,460
I bear you no grudge.

1145
02:20:21,838 --> 02:20:24,864
Don't lie to me!
I've had my fill of honeyed words!

1146
02:20:32,015 --> 02:20:36,611
My lord, has Master Saburo
ever been one to lie?

1147
02:20:37,955 --> 02:20:40,822
False words roll freely
off many tongues,

1148
02:20:41,925 --> 02:20:44,792
but look at him, my lord.

1149
02:20:46,430 --> 02:20:50,298
These tears do not deceive.

1150
02:20:54,504 --> 02:20:56,028
Father,

1151
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:59,234
come with me.

1152
02:20:59,643 --> 02:21:01,702
Come live with me

1153
02:21:02,012 --> 02:21:04,310
and forget this frightful dream.

1154
02:21:07,517 --> 02:21:12,045
Please forget what I did.

1155
02:21:13,357 --> 02:21:15,222
Forgive me.

1156
02:21:15,859 --> 02:21:19,226
I was a senile old fool.

1157
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:25,461
Father!

1158
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:46,851
All forces...

1159
02:21:51,461 --> 02:21:53,429
attack!

1160
02:22:53,156 --> 02:22:55,147
The enemy has taken cover
in the woods.

1161
02:22:55,725 --> 02:22:59,092
Our superior strength
is useless there.

1162
02:22:59,596 --> 02:23:02,690
Then we'll burn them out!

1163
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:28,589
Charge!

1164
02:23:43,573 --> 02:23:45,200
Press the attack!

1165
02:23:45,976 --> 02:23:47,944
Press the attack!

1166
02:23:50,747 --> 02:23:51,839
Pull back!

1167
02:23:55,585 --> 02:23:56,574
Pull back!

1168
02:24:02,092 --> 02:24:04,083
We should be crushing them!

1169
02:24:04,294 --> 02:24:05,921
Forward!

1170
02:24:48,271 --> 02:24:49,863
My lord!

1171
02:24:56,680 --> 02:25:00,377
Ayabe's army has crossed the border.
He's marching on your castle!

1172
02:25:00,784 --> 02:25:02,445
What?

1173
02:25:02,652 --> 02:25:05,052
Ayabe is on that ridge!

1174
02:25:12,762 --> 02:25:16,027
Damn it!
Those troops are decoys!

1175
02:25:23,807 --> 02:25:26,537
Pull back!

1176
02:26:14,424 --> 02:26:15,550
After them!

1177
02:26:22,132 --> 02:26:23,599
After them!

1178
02:27:15,618 --> 02:27:17,245
Cease pursuit!

1179
02:27:30,066 --> 02:27:31,624
Again!

1180
02:27:48,618 --> 02:27:51,314
I have so much to tell you.

1181
02:27:52,021 --> 02:27:53,648
Saburo,

1182
02:27:54,591 --> 02:27:57,219
you and I will talk quietly alone,

1183
02:27:58,528 --> 02:28:01,964
just father and son.

1184
02:28:04,367 --> 02:28:06,767
That's all I want.

1185
02:28:08,037 --> 02:28:09,971
Nothing else.

1186
02:28:47,710 --> 02:28:49,644
He's dead.

1187
02:28:54,117 --> 02:28:56,051
I've got wits enough to see that!

1188
02:29:10,767 --> 02:29:12,701
Saburo's dead.

1189
02:29:14,270 --> 02:29:17,364
You and I live...

1190
02:29:18,641 --> 02:29:20,541
but Saburo is -

1191
02:29:33,122 --> 02:29:34,987
You can't die.

1192
02:29:37,627 --> 02:29:39,390
I have things to tell you...

1193
02:29:41,798 --> 02:29:43,629
forgiveness to beg.

1194
02:29:46,603 --> 02:29:48,434
How can this be?

1195
02:29:50,573 --> 02:29:54,441
Are you really gone forever?

1196
02:29:57,514 --> 02:29:59,209
Don't touch me!

1197
02:30:07,357 --> 02:30:09,917
It grows dark.

1198
02:30:11,661 --> 02:30:13,959
Wretched old age!

1199
02:30:14,597 --> 02:30:16,326
This is the end.

1200
02:30:20,937 --> 02:30:23,303
My lord!

1201
02:30:35,885 --> 02:30:38,649
No, my lord!

1202
02:30:45,094 --> 02:30:48,495
Kyoami, do not call
his spirit back.

1203
02:30:49,933 --> 02:30:52,902
Would you have him suffer
still more?

1204
02:30:59,509 --> 02:31:00,533
<i>Lord Saburo!</i>

1205
02:31:11,220 --> 02:31:13,085
A surprise attack
by Ayabe's forces

1206
02:31:13,289 --> 02:31:17,055
has sent the enemy in retreat
to the First Castle!

1207
02:31:17,527 --> 02:31:19,620
Victory is ours!

1208
02:31:22,231 --> 02:31:23,823
How can this be?

1209
02:31:27,704 --> 02:31:30,172
Of all things, at this moment,

1210
02:31:30,406 --> 02:31:33,000
why did Master Saburo
have to die?

1211
02:31:33,676 --> 02:31:36,839
Why did Lord Hidetora
have to go?

1212
02:31:39,182 --> 02:31:42,117
Are there no gods,
no buddhas?

1213
02:31:43,987 --> 02:31:45,921
If you exist, hear my words:

1214
02:31:46,222 --> 02:31:48,588
You're all cruel
and fickle pranksters!

1215
02:31:50,193 --> 02:31:52,093
You ease your boredom
in the heavens

1216
02:31:52,295 --> 02:31:55,458
by crushing us like worms!

1217
02:31:56,032 --> 02:31:57,431
Damn you!

1218
02:31:57,634 --> 02:32:00,296
Is it such sport
to see us weep and howl?

1219
02:32:00,503 --> 02:32:03,199
Stop it!
Do not curse the gods!

1220
02:32:04,641 --> 02:32:06,973
It is they who weep.

1221
02:32:08,745 --> 02:32:12,237
In every age they've watched us
tread the path of evil,

1222
02:32:12,482 --> 02:32:15,315
unable to live
without killing each other.

1223
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:19,049
They can't save us
from ourselves.

1224
02:32:24,961 --> 02:32:26,394
Stop your crying!

1225
02:32:28,097 --> 02:32:29,928
Such is the way of the world.

1226
02:32:30,667 --> 02:32:33,192
Men live not for joy
but for sorrow,

1227
02:32:33,403 --> 02:32:35,871
not for peace
but for suffering.

1228
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:39,873
Look at those
in the First Castle.

1229
02:32:40,109 --> 02:32:43,670
Even now they vie for the greater
share of sorrow and suffering

1230
02:32:43,880 --> 02:32:46,110
and revel
in their mutual slaughter.

1231
02:32:58,961 --> 02:33:00,428
My lord!

1232
02:33:01,597 --> 02:33:04,862
We will defend this position.
You must go to the keep.

1233
02:33:23,686 --> 02:33:26,086
Inside!

1234
02:33:26,322 --> 02:33:29,314
Hurry up!
Close the gate!

1235
02:33:29,559 --> 02:33:31,356
Where's Lord Jiro?

1236
02:33:31,928 --> 02:33:36,092
Whose head is that,
Saburo's or Hidetora's?

1237
02:33:36,299 --> 02:33:39,166
Neither. It is another's,
on order of his lordship.

1238
02:33:39,502 --> 02:33:40,992
What?

1239
02:34:13,770 --> 02:34:15,499
Stop, Kurogane!

1240
02:34:16,773 --> 02:34:19,674
Who rules this domain,
you or Lady Kaede?

1241
02:34:19,876 --> 02:34:23,642
I pledged fealty to you,
but never to her!

1242
02:34:31,654 --> 02:34:33,019
She-fox!

1243
02:34:33,222 --> 02:34:37,215
Your vain schemes have destroyed
the house of Ichimonji!

1244
02:34:37,426 --> 02:34:40,259
Do you see now
how foolish you were?

1245
02:34:40,463 --> 02:34:42,294
On the contrary.

1246
02:34:43,833 --> 02:34:47,325
My sole desire
was to avenge my family

1247
02:34:47,737 --> 02:34:50,205
by watching
the house of Ichimonji fall

1248
02:34:50,439 --> 02:34:52,771
and seeing this castle burn.

1249
02:35:07,456 --> 02:35:09,117
Silence!

1250
02:35:11,027 --> 02:35:12,119
My lord,

1251
02:35:12,795 --> 02:35:15,127
we are undone.
Prepare to die.

1252
02:35:15,331 --> 02:35:17,856
I will follow you directly.

1253
02:42:02,438 --> 02:42:06,568
Directed by
AKIRA KUROSAWA

1254
02:42:09,111 --> 02:42:12,774
THE END
