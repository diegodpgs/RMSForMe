talk and even bleed just like humans do.</i>

00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:35,707
I think it's the sensor. But if it's the
central unit, we'll have to open her up.

307
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,710
Well, you get a confirmation
before you do that.

308
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:46,510
- What's he in for?
- Central malfunction.

309

Another one? Hmm.

310
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,071
SUPERVISOR:
From the day we opened...

311
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,783
...we had a failure-and-breakdown rate
conforming to computer predictions.

312
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:14,705
That is, 0.3 malfunctions
for each 24-hour activation period...

313
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,914
...concurrent or not.

314
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,334
Now, this was an anticipated operations
aspect of the resort...

315
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,378
...and we were fully able to handle it.

316
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,591
The majority of the breakdowns
were minor or peripheral...

317
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,301
...until about six weeks ago.

318
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,762
Then Roman World
had a rise in breakdown rate...

319
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,848
...which doubled in a week.

320
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,726
In addition, we saw
a disproportionate rise in central...

321
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,270
...as opposed to peripheral,
breakdowns.

322
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,940
Now, we identified some problems
with humidity control...

323
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,984
...and regained homeostasis.

324
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,738
Well, despite our corrections,
the breakdown rate continued to climb.

325
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,616
Then Medieval World began
to have trouble.

326
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,410
Now we're seeing
more Western World breakdowns.

327
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,830
There's a clear pattern here
which suggests an analogy...

328
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:01,293
...to an infectious-disease process,
spreading from one area to the next.

329
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,880
Perhaps there are superficial similarities
to disease.

330
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,176
It's only a theoretical concept.
There are many ways to order that data.

331
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:14,139
I must confess, I find it difficult
to believe in a disease of machinery.

332
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,017
But we aren't dealing
with ordinary machines here.

333
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,062
These are highly complicated
pieces of equipment...

334
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:23,023
...almost as complicated
as living organisms.

335
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,568
In some cases, they've been designed
by other computers.

336
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,279
We don't know exactly how they work.
