1
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,412
Don't tell me how well you fight,

2
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,369
or how great your teacher is,

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,832
or brag about your style.

4
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,908
Kungfu -

5
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,619
two words.

6
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,116
Horizontal. Vertical.

7
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,083
Make a mistake - horizontal.

8
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,866
Stay standing and you win.

9
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,953
Isn't that right?

10
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,665
<THE GRANDMASTER>

11
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,995
We're from Foshan.

12
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,411
My father ran the family business.

13
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,243
He exported goods to Hong Kong.

14
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,329
The Ips have a long history in Foshan.

15
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,994
They named a street after us.

16
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,790
That's how wealthy we were.

17
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,666
Before I turned 40, life was easy.

18
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,832
I lived off my family money.

19
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,249
I had only one passion.

20
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,665
At seven, I started learning kungfu.

21
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,158
My master was Chan Wah-shun.

22
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,996
Foshan's Wing Chun began with Leung Jan.

23
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,824
I'm the third generation.

24
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,416
When I started, my master was seventy.

25
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:28,158
The day I became a disciple,

26
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,499
he tied the sash himself.

27
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,997
This sash stands for school and teacher.

28
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,449
It stands for honor.

29
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,785
You are now a martial artist.

30
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,534
You must live your life with honor.

31
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,366
One sash, an unbroken tradition.

32
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,287
I lived through dynastic times,

33
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,166
the early republic, warlords,

34
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,912
Japanese invasion and civil war.

35
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,866
Finally, I came to Hong Kong.

36
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,574
What kept me going

37
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,451
was the martial arts code of honor.

38
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,290
My wife, Zhang Yongcheng,

39
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,288
was the descendant of an Imperial Minister.

40
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,536
She was a woman of few words

41
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,582
because she knew their power.

42
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,950
We understood each other well.

43
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,369
She loved music.

44
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,041
I'd take her to hear opera.

45
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,579
People were so conservative back then.

46
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,834
Nice women didn't visit places like this.

47
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,953
But gossip didn't bother her.

48
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,659
When I went out, she lit a lamp

49
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:40,160
and left it lit till I came home.

50
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,162
If life has seasons,

51
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,455
my first forty years were spring.

52
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,873
(1936. Foshan, Guangdong Province.)

53
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,582
In 1936, Foshan

54
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,074
was a prosperous city.

55
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,616
Life was peaceful and good.

56
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,080
Back then, men socialised in brothels.

57
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,075
Such places were popular in the South.

58
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,865
Foshan's finest was Republic House.

59
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,037
Its walls were covered in gold,

60
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,707
so we called it the Gold Pavilion.

61
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,950
It was the first to have an elevator.

62
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,332
Enter a prince, exit a pauper.

63
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,374
You'd spend money like water.

64
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,750
It was like a social club for martial artists.

65
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,913
Good men can be found among rogues.

66
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,243
And hidden masters too.

67
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,699
People saw it as a pleasure palace.

68
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,707
But to us,

69
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,158
it was a battleground.

70
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:09,490
I claim three accomplishments in life.

71
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,826
First, I united Xingyi and Bagua styles.

72
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,912
Second, I became the director

73
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,458
of the Northern Martial Arts Union,

74
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:23,332
bringing together Tongbei, Cannon Fist,

75
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:25,750
Tai Chi, Yan Qing and other schools.

76
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:32,079
Third, I took the northern masters south.

77
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,915
In 1929,

78
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,700
the First Southern Martial Arts Academy

79
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,824
was founded under my supervision

80
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,791
after talks here in the Gold Pavilion.

81
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,661
I'm getting old.

82
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,037
It's time for new blood.

83
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,452
I held a retirement ceremony up North.

84
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:58,038
You invited me to hold a second one here.

85
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:06,073
It's my farewell to my southern comrades.

86
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,037
Up North, the one who took part

87
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,833
was my top disciple, Ma San.

88
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,074
He'll be my successor.

89
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,992
Please give him your support.

90
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:26,747
I'd always wanted

91
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,084
to take the southern styles north.

92
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,574
Sadly, my time's up.

93
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:39,242
I want to hold a demonstration match

94
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:43,535
with a southern martial artist.

95
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,159
Someone you all support.

96
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,332
Pick one.

97
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,083
Think you're good enough

98
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,999
to challenge the Old Master?

99
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,116
Let's keep it simple.

100
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,374
I'll take you all on.

101
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,957
Get him!

102
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:52,080
that at the ceremony up North,

103
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,491
I had the honor.

104
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,118
To worship at the feet of the Buddha

105
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,332
first pass the Guardian of the Gate.

106
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,741
That's me.

107
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,954
How can I represent the South?

108
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,661
The southern schools

109
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,995
are Hung, Lau, Choy, Lee, and Mok.

110
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,664
In rank,

111
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,116
you are all my seniors.

112
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,953
You're the leaders and masters.

113
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,824
I have no standing.

114
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,406
The reputation of the South is at stake.

115
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,870
We Southerners

116
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,662
may be petty,

117
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,416
but we don't run away from a fight.

118
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,033
We're not afraid of these Northerners!

119
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,624
This is a challenge.

120
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,082
We will rise to it.

121
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,323
Isn't that right?

122
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,869
Absolutely!

123
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,911
It must be you.

124
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,582
I'll take the kids to my mother's.

125
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,332
Less for you to worry about.

126
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,415
When a man reaches forty,

127
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,659
he needs to be sure of things.

128
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,369
When it's all over,

129
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,624
come pick us up.

130
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,741
Do you know

131
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,332
why a knife must have a sheath?

132
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,493
Its power lies not in sharpness,

133
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,749
but in concealment.

134
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,662
You're too sharp a blade.

135
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,034
You have to stay put.

136
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,499
My sheath

137
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,119
is you, Master.

138
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,661
With you around,

139
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,283
I'm under control.

140
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:09,783
I can no longer control you.

141
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,832
You're too anxious to make your mark.

142
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,833
For now, leave Foshan.

143
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,199
Miss that train,

144
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,332
and I'll break your legs.

145
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,408
Central News:

146
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,332
Southern armies

147
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,370
marched north

148
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,073
claiming for autonomy.

149
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,242
The Central Army blocked their advance.

150
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,741
The situation is explosive.

151
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,123
Halt!

152
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,241
Let us pass.

153
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,950
Sorry. This street is closed off.

154
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,996
No one bearing arms can enter.

155
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,540
Do you know who's in that rickshaw?

156
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,905
Call out the Gong Family disciples!

157
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,408
Miss Gong, it's good you're here.

158
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,740
He must call this off.
Win or lose, it's a disgrace.

159
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,366
My father has never lost.

160
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,366
There's no question of losing.

161
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,701
And so what if he wins?

162
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,829
They'll say he beat a nobody.

163
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,994
Ip Man's not at his level.

164
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,491
Where's my father?

165
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,536
Brother.

166
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,329
It's me, Baosen.

167
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:46,497
Isn't the Northeast big enough for you?

168
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,500
You had to come to Foshan? Get up.

169
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,996
I'm taking you home.

170
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,366
Home?

171
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,283
How's that possible?

172
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,660
The Japanese control the Northeast.

173
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,912
The Japanese flag

174
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,116
won't wave over me.

175
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,994
The time's not ripe.

176
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,665
Making soup like this

177
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,829
is a lot of work.

178
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,161
It's not soup.

179
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,240
It's snake stew.

180
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,082
Isn't that a winter dish?

181
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,496
It's a dish from a long time ago.

182
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,036
Yes, decades.

183
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,328
was a Snake Year.

184
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:50,331
You left the Northeast that year.

185
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,747
The fire has to be right for stew.

186
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,624
Too low -

187
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,074
it'll lack taste.

188
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,074
Too high -

189
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,874
it'll scald.

190
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,324
There's a lesson in that.

191
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,624
Go.

192
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:23,749
Wait till the fire can take this wood.

193
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,374
I'll go then.

194
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,619
The South may secede.

195
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:31,703
It's no time for diplomacy.

196
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,286
We're getting old.

197
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,291
Don't risk your reputation.

198
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:44,240
Ip is more than he appears to be.

199
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,286
Force it,

200
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,783
things could go wrong.

201
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,162
I know what I'm doing.

202
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,449
I'm creating opportunity.

203
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,995
This fire today

204
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,332
needs new wood.

205
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:12,704
Your northern colleagues

206
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,744
disapprove of this match.

207
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,207
It's a huge honor.

208
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,866
This Ip doesn't deserve it.

209
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,207
It's not how things are done.

210
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,040
Don't follow the herd.

211
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,332
If the old never let go

212
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,705
when will the young get their chance?

213
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,245
Ip Man has talent.

214
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:37,409
Let's see if he can prove himself.

215
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,241
The Gong Family has never lost before.

216
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,244
With you here,

217
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,741
what right does he have?

218
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:53,206
I once had a temper like yours:

219
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,992
winning was everything.

220
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,665
But life's bigger than that.

221
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,040
Take a longer view.

222
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:03,949
Past the mountains

223
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,162
the world opens up.

224
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:12,497
Not to see the good in others,

225
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,415
not to admit their talent,

226
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,204
is to lack generosity.

227
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,791
Our high standards in martial arts

228
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,162
apply to character as well.

229
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:01,703
Father,

230
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:08,412
why did you bring me to a brothel?

231
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,665
If you don't see something,

232
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,829
does it not exist?

233
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,870
No harm in seeing.

234
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,165
The first time I came here

235
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,658
was before you were born.

236
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,243
Twenty years have passed in a flash.

237
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,036
In life,

238
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,874
ability isn't everything.

239
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,324
Some thrive in light,

240
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,495
others in shadow.

241
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,454
The times make us what we are.

242
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:46,124
I asked you to come South

243
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,245
to bring things full circle

244
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,245
and to let you see

245
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,958
how I step down.

246
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:55,991
Since you were little,

247
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:59,163
you've watched me fight.

248
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,162
This is the last time.

249
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,950
You're engaged to be married.

250
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,665
The Martial World

251
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,207
is no longer your world.

252
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,286
Be a good doctor.

253
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:14,158
Live a peaceful life.

254
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,659
This is my greatest wish.

255
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,991
Master Ip.

256
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:33,323
We're here to celebrate.

257
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,450
Your big day is coming up.

258
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:40,332
We'd like to show you our support.

259
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,949
I'm humbled, Uncle Deng.

260
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,991
It's nothing at all.

261
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,832
Don't mention it.

262
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,449
Please.

263
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,200
On behalf of the ladies

264
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,916
and staff, congratulations.

265
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,624
That's quite a battle formation.

266
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,493
Sister San heads our Peking Opera troupe.

267
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,203
She dabbles in Bagua.

268
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,996
She'd like to offer a few pointers.

269
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:27,249
Please.

270
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:29,698
After you.

271
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,665
Bagua is based on swordplay.

272
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,454
Single reverse palm is a single blade.

273
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,037
Double reverse palm is a double blade.

274
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,909
The feet arc out and in.

275
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,329
There are 64 transformations.

276
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,125
Attack comes out of nowhere.

277
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,663
Sister San, it's just practice.

278
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:15,707
No need to smash the ancestral tablets.

279
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,832
I've done that many times before.

280
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,244
No big deal.

281
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,167
Mr Ip, Bagua is underhanded.

282
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,915
Beware.

283
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:29,828
Thank you.

284
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,785
Ah, Mr Ip.

285
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,408
Today is a happy day.

286
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:47,536
We in Accounts wish you well.

287
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,781
Xingyi began with General Yue Fei.

288
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,041
It uses the fist as a spear.

289
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:03,283
Drill

290
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:04,828
Chop

291
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,074
Cross

292
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,289
Blast

293
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,074
Crush

294
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,323
Such sensitivity - impressive!

295
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:55,160
That Crushing Fist is quite something.

296
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,369
Mr Ip,

297
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,869
each challenge leads to a higher peak.

298
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,832
Xingyi is brutal.

299
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,624
Don't underestimate it.

300
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,991
Let's see how high the peaks get.

301
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,993
Hmm. This will be fun.

302
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:26,118
My turn now, Master Ip.

303
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,746
And what have you got for me, Yong?

304
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,374
A string of firecrackers.

305
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:00,406
That move, isn't that Hung Gar?

306
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,783
I'm a jack of all trades.

307
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:15,499
You do mix it up.

308
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,707
What's wrong with that?

309
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,491
So long as it works.

310
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,327
The 64 Hands have endless combinations.

311
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,996
Your Wing Chun is a three-trick pony.

312
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,957
Spade, Pin, Sheath.

313
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,866
How can it compete?

314
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,741
Three's enough to take care of you.

315
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,702
Yong, your fireworks have fizzled.

316
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,117
What of it? I'm an old man.

317
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,866
Youth trumps skill.

318
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,283
He might be a grandmaster,

319
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,162
but don't hold back.

320
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,241
You'd better win.

321
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:38,908
This has been a real privilege.

322
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,912
To victory!

323
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:41,998
Good luck.

324
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:15,870
Every generation produces new talent.

325
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,872
Mr Ip, we were fated to meet.

326
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,829
For my final contest

327
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,621
I suggest we match wits,

328
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,082
not skill.

329
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,323
Do you accept?

330
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,704
As our guest,

331
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:32,994
it's up to you.

332
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:46,663
When our Union was founded 25 years ago,

333
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,325
a man came from the South.

334
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,286
He offered a challenge.

335
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,325
He held out a flat cake

336
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:59,121
and asked our Master to break.

337
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,492
Our Master wasn't offended.

338
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:10,156
He even named the man our first chairman.

339
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,700
It wasn't because of his kungfu

340
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,411
but what he said -

341
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,790
Kungfu divides into North and South.

342
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,241
Must the country divide as well?

343
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,997
That man was also from Foshan -

344
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,662
Ip Yun-biu.

345
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,408
He was a great man.

346
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,540
Today,

347
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:35,410
meeting another Mr Ip,

348
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:39,868
I will ask that same question.

349
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,828
Mr Ip,

350
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:48,203
can you break this cake in my hand?

351
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:40,122
A Tai Chi master kept a bird from flying

352
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,000
by giving it no perch

353
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,707
from which to fly.

354
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,162
The Old Master's skill is too great.

355
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:51,496
Mr Ip is a sparrow in his palm.

356
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,995
I don't think he can do it.

357
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,329
The world is a big place.

358
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:51,994
Why limit it to North and South?

359
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,541
It holds you back.

360
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,162
To you,

361
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,370
this cake is the country.

362
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,074
To me it's much more.

363
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,915
Break from what you know

364
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,074
and you will know more.

365
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,411
If the Southern arts go far,

366
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,743
what boundary is the North?

367
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,199
Would you agree?

368
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:17,665
Well said.

369
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,957
All my life, I've been the victor.

370
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,741
My technique has never failed me.

371
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,912
I never thought I'd see

372
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,791
the limits of my own vision.

373
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:40,369
Mr Ip,

374
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:44,075
today I've made you famous.

375
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,991
In future,

376
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,958
you'll face challenges at every step.

377
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,741
I hope you'll be like me.

378
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,996
Pass on the torch.

379
00:35:57,167 --> 00:36:00,535
Never give up the faith.

380
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,493
Keep the light burning.

381
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,874
Miss Gong, you mustn't do this.

382
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,832
The Gongs have never been defeated.

383
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:05,452
I will redeem our honor.

384
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:10,041
Give this to Ip. He'll understand.

385
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,370
I have no chance

386
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:16,788
to be as great as Father.

387
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,957
It wasn't my choice.

388
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,616
But I'll make my mark.

389
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,199
Go.

390
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,666
Tonight, following Northern custom,

391
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:35,999
the winner will host a banquet.

392
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,164
Neither Ip Man nor I will attend.

393
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,991
You'll represent me.

394
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,161
Don't worry.

395
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:45,580
I'll do the right thing.

396
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:47,824
Let's go!

397
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:10,333
Of Master Gong's martial arts,

398
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,871
Ma San inherited the steel

399
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:16,323
and his daughter the silk.

400
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:19,285
She is the sole heir to the 64 Hands.

401
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:23,491
Her moves are deadly.

402
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:27,991
In booking the whole place first,

403
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,951
she forces your hand.

404
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,582
Don't underrate Gong Er.

405
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,415
The Martial World has four taboos:

406
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,538
monks, Taoist priests, women and children.

407
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:41,824
Grappling with them is a bad idea.

408
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,244
She's gone to so much trouble -

409
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,741
how could I not accept?

410
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,491
Three days ago,

411
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,745
my father sat here.

412
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,661
Tonight,

413
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,537
it's between us.

414
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:39,414
Please.

415
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:42,500
Pity about the lovely decor.

416
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:45,074
Kungfu is about precision.

417
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,491
If anything gets broken,

418
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:48,914
you win.

419
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,161
Mr Ip,

420
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:10,745
I showed you the 64 Hands

421
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:12,824
so that you'd know

422
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:15,871
the world is a big place.

423
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,159
Kungfu isn't just charging forward.

424
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,578
Look behind you as well.

425
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:22,000
I hope that's enough of a clue.

426
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:23,790
It went your way this time.

427
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,707
Who knows what

428
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,290
next time will bring.

429
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,164
Come.

430
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,207
I'll be waiting.

431
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:34,078
Take care.

432
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:45,657
(I dream of seeing the 64 Hands)
(again in the snow.)

433
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:32,744
(I'm waiting. What's keeping you?)

434
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:01,707
Does it fit?

435
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,699
Does Foshan get this cold?

436
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:12,290
You look lovely.

437
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:14,375
Let's take a family photo.

438
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:35,159
(October 1938. Foshan fell to the Japanese.)

439
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,661
In October 1938,

440
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:43,994
the Japanese invaded Foshan.

441
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:47,121
Their army took over our home.

442
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:49,870
If life has four seasons,

443
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:53,664
we went from spring straight to winter.

444
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:36,871
I'll be back with dinner.

445
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,957
Help me prosper?

446
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,665
Rescue me from poverty?

447
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:58,662
I've never been poor in my life.

448
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:00,908
The country's in crisis

449
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:02,748
and everyone is suffering.

450
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,582
To be poor is no big deal.

451
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,324
I'd rather starve

452
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:11,699
than eat Japanese rice.

453
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:14,249
I won't collaborate.

454
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,243
I have plenty of friends.

455
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:21,997
They'll help me through.

456
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:23,828
Enjoy your dinner.

457
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,659
You won't find those friends here,

458
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,741
only collaborators.

459
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,412
We had a dinner just now.

460
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:37,908
These are the leftovers.

461
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:39,203
If it's not beneath you,

462
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,120
take them back to your family.

463
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,119
How can I accept?

464
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,324
Dirty money paid for it.

465
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:51,041
No point in waste. We're old friends.

466
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,703
You're most welcome.

467
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,699
They're brand new.

468
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,707
I was going to the Northeast.

469
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,491
But that's impossible now.

470
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,834
Sell them and I can feed my family.

471
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:00,244
Why is there a button missing?

472
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,457
Is there?

473
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,661
Must've dropped off.

474
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:14,824
I began studying kungfu at seven.

475
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,165
Before I turned forty,

476
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,578
I was never beaten.

477
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,161
When that happened,

478
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:22,200
It was life that dealt the blows.

479
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:24,449
In eight years of war

480
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:25,744
I lost everything.

481
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:27,328
Money,

482
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:28,665
friends...

483
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:32,114
China will never die!

484
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,741
Girls obey their Madam.

485
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:41,249
Gangsters obey their boss.

486
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,824
Our boss was Sun Yat-sen

487
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:45,449
We followed his orders.

488
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:50,200
We Southerners have fire in our bellies

489
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:51,699
and a sense of honour.

490
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:56,826
Only cowards fear the Japs.

491
00:52:57,167 --> 00:52:58,578
I'll kill any I see!

492
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:02,619
(1938. Uncle Deng died)
(in a Japanese bombardment.)

493
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:05,697
(Collaborators took over the Gold Pavilion.)

494
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:07,824
Finally, I lost my family.

495
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:49,616
(Ip Man lost two daughters in the war.)

496
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,333
No one move!

497
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:29,287
Where are you going? Show your IDs!

498
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,207
Hurry.

499
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:32,994
IDs!

500
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:38,083
Where are you going? IDs!

501
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:42,747
Halt!

502
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:54,498
(1939. Traveling to Northwest University)
(to practice medicine,)

503
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,833
(Gong Er meets The Razor, a Nationalist agent.)

504
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:26,659
(1940. Ma San collaborates with the Japanese,)

505
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:29,000
(taking an official post in the puppet government.)

506
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,333
Do you remember what I taught you?

507
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:02,369
Yes.

508
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:05,955
Never put yourself first,

509
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:07,999
show respect.

510
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,822
There's always someone better.

511
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:14,699
To yield is not to lose.

512
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:18,121
Master, you have taught me

513
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:22,081
to be modest

514
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:23,574
and know my place.

515
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,495
I took you in as an orphan.

516
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,575
You brought

517
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:32,326
credit to our school.

518
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,912
Let's go over

519
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:37,662
my supreme move.

520
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,494
The Old Monkey Hangs up his Badge.

521
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:46,582
Have you practiced it?

522
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,832
Yes.

523
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:52,122
You know the key to it?

524
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:54,663
I was never told.

525
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:56,499
It's looking back in reflection.

526
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:58,658
It's not the upward move,

527
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:00,741
but the turning back.

528
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:07,534
Understand what I'm saying?

529
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:11,583
A warrior molds himself to the times.

530
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:15,828
What if

531
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,162
I can't turn back?

532
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,162
Then the Gong Family legacy

533
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:27,246
cannot live on in you.

534
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,616
Stay back.

535
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:50,699
Let him go.

536
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:54,659
Never darken my door again.

537
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:02,249
Get lost.

538
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,074
Master!

539
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:22,748
The whole clan

540
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:24,616
heard you were coming

541
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,324
and raced in from all over.

542
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:27,289
And Jiang?

543
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:29,033
He's keeping them company.

544
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:38,365
Miss Gong,

545
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:41,325
they're awaiting your decision.

546
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:43,329
They didn't come all this way

547
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:45,790
to hear my decision.

548
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:50,991
Did Father have any last words?

549
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,411
Don't seek vengeance.

550
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:58,033
Miss,

551
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,332
your father forbade revenge.

552
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,579
I agree Ma San deserves to die.

553
01:01:38,917 --> 01:01:40,954
It's a massive crime

554
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,661
to betray one's teacher.

555
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:47,495
Nothing is worse.

556
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:50,165
On the other hand,

557
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,783
it was your father

558
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:56,250
who united Xingyi and Bagua.

559
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,823
Ma San worked hard at Xingyi.

560
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:02,491
And your father taught you

561
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,663
the 64 Hands himself.

562
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:09,326
The two of you are his legacy.

563
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:11,536
If you stand together,

564
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:15,326
the legacy remains whole.

565
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:18,078
Besides,

566
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:20,996
if you take action,

567
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:24,205
whatever the outcome,

568
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,325
people will laugh.

569
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,538
They'll say what's this Gong school

570
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:32,332
where the disciple kills the master,

571
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,534
and the daughter kills her brother-in-arms?

572
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:40,324
A pack of wild animals?

573
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,325
Besides, as for Ma San,

574
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:46,705
even your father couldn't finish him off.

575
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,366
You think you can?

576
01:02:49,667 --> 01:02:51,033
Miss Gong,

577
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,413
we're old men.

578
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,414
We made the long trip here

579
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:03,994
with your best interests in mind.

580
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:06,825
Take our advice.

581
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:09,666
Just get married.

582
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,662
Your father's last words

583
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:16,500
were Don't seek vengeance.

584
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:19,666
If you kill Ma San

585
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:22,371
won't that go against his wishes?

586
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:26,624
My father said that

587
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,661
out of love for me.

588
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:32,454
He wants me to have a peaceful life.

589
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:35,999
But if I don't avenge his death,

590
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,369
I'll never be at peace.

591
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,662
I understand what you're saying.

592
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:50,665
With respect,

593
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:55,081
he treated you

594
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,116
all like brothers.

595
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,328
After he died,

596
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:03,159
you should've dealt with Ma San.

597
01:04:03,417 --> 01:04:04,953
Instead you come here

598
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:07,200
as his messenger.

599
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:12,159
After all my father did for you!

600
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:15,578
I know

601
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:18,449
Ma San works for the Japanese.

602
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:20,533
He's got power.

603
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:23,824
But I'll stand up for my family.

604
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,829
Is he coming, or not?

605
01:04:32,292 --> 01:04:34,409
What does it matter?

606
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,243
He comes, you go,

607
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,870
and that's the end of it, right?

608
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:47,453
It's better to let it go, Miss Gong.

609
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:50,371
Some things are out of our hands.

610
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:53,329
It's the Will of Heaven.

611
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,041
Maybe I am the Will of Heaven.

612
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:26,281
Oh ye gods and spirits

613
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:31,497
guide this soul to Paradise!

614
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,866
Halt!

615
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,165
We mustn't stop!

616
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:45,034
Don't block the road.

617
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,495
Keep to the side.

618
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,365
Move!

619
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,912
Ma San ordered us

620
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:52,408
to escort the body.

621
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,244
Miss Gong,

622
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,331
Ma San's men

623
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,824
are blocking the road.

624
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:00,324
The have banners of mourning.

625
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:02,165
Troublemakers!

626
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:03,123
Miss Gong,

627
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:06,084
time is of the essence.

628
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:10,082
Jiang!

629
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:33,326
Tell Ma San he's a dead man.

630
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,371
Let's go!

631
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:43,497
Oh ye gods and spirits

632
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:47,747
...guide this soul to Paradise!

633
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,574
They're here.

634
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,824
Stop her.

635
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:01,407
Keep her back.

636
01:08:01,417 --> 01:08:02,453
Let me at her.

637
01:08:02,792 --> 01:08:03,953
Stop her.

638
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,621
Stay back. We're here for Ma San.

639
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:18,745
Since you're my senior,

640
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:20,578
I won't force my way in.

641
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,707
But know this.

642
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,333
You can't hide from me forever.

643
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:28,620
I will take back my family's legacy.

644
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:29,990
Come out!

645
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:36,957
Better to advance than to stop.

646
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:40,288
The Old Master taught me this.

647
01:08:40,292 --> 01:08:42,659
It became my philosophy of life.

648
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:43,908
It's a shame

649
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:45,704
he couldn't follow his own advice.

650
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:49,701
His precious teachings are mine now.

651
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,036
You want them -

652
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,541
send a member of the family.

653
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,120
You'll be marrying out.

654
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:02,749
You don't count.

655
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,412
Don't ask after me.

656
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:30,829
No news means I'm gone.

657
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:39,249
Find someone else.

658
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,206
Miss,

659
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:50,371
to give up such an ideal marriage -

660
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:52,158
is it really worth it?

661
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:56,874
Think it over.

662
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,661
If you take those vows,

663
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:01,495
you'll never be able to marry,

664
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:05,751
teach, or have children.

665
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:09,200
There's no turning back.

666
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,199
Father,

667
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:22,079
can you read what's in my heart?

668
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,991
If you agree with me,

669
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:30,454
show me a flame before Buddha.

670
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:12,826
Better to advance than to stop.

671
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:16,332
He mocks us for having no successor.

672
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:32,658
I can only advance.

673
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:35,328
I can't stop.

674
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:29,582
(1950. Hong Kong. Tai Nan Street)

675
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:36,078
Ever taught before, Master Ip?

676
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:37,824
To teach for a living

677
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:38,949
is a new experience.

678
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:40,790
So why now?

679
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:42,498
I'm starting a new life.

680
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,207
You've got your things.

681
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:45,619
You're confident.

682
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,164
Saves running back and forth.

683
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:49,158
In Hong Kong no one knows Wing Chun.

684
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:50,994
Any special moves?

685
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:52,331
Not really.

686
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,496
Three basic hands - Spade, Pin, Sheath.

687
01:12:56,542 --> 01:12:57,703
How many forms?

688
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,036
The Concept,

689
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,331
The Bridge,

690
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:02,573
and Darting Fingers.

691
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,616
Weapons?

692
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:06,494
Double Knives

693
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,832
and the Six-and-a-half Point Pole.

694
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,749
Anything else?

695
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,491
That's it.

696
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:14,033
Bone-setting,

697
01:13:14,042 --> 01:13:15,123
internal energy -

698
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,332
I don't do any of that.

699
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,499
Drifters,

700
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,536
lion dancers -

701
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,582
I don't teach those types.

702
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:23,332
Why not?

703
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:27,204
Kungfu isn't a sideshow.

704
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,207
So I won't teach drifters.

705
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:31,578
Lion dancers jump at firecrackers.

706
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,824
They're always brawling

707
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,991
and showing off,

708
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:37,749
all for a bit of cash.

709
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:40,158
It's crude.

710
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:41,999
I'll ask you straight -

711
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:43,869
ever been in a real fight?

712
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:47,787
It's wall-to-wall kungfu schools here.

713
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:49,283
They start fights over nothing.

714
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,665
Master Ip,

715
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:53,161
have you got what it takes?

716
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:56,160
Try me and find out.

717
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:58,574
Fight! Fight!

718
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,832
I've had a few years of training.

719
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:05,415
Show me your stuff, Master Ip.

720
01:14:05,417 --> 01:14:06,703
Have you had lunch?

721
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,324
Barbecued pork and rice.

722
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:09,494
I suggest you wait a bit.

723
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,536
It'd be a shame to waste it.

724
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:11,623
Waste it?

725
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:26,657
Brother Hung,

726
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:28,290
are you okay?

727
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:31,832
Where's the tea?

728
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,074
Tea?

729
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:34,323
To give to your new master!

730
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:36,909
We've put a bed here for you.

731
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,199
I hope it'll do for now.

732
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:41,828
Sorry it's a bit shabby.

733
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:58,494
Is there a hammer?

734
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,161
Master Ip,

735
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:20,951
The boys and I want some lessons.

736
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:21,869
Eighty cents a head.

737
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:23,161
Cheap enough.

738
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:24,408
But call yourself a master,

739
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:25,498
you'd better deliver the goods.

740
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,207
No snake oil.

741
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:29,165
How good's your kungfu, anyway?

742
01:15:44,792 --> 01:15:45,748
Lock the gate.

743
01:15:48,792 --> 01:15:49,407
Hey!

744
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:50,498
Little fucker.

745
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,287
Shut the door and it's on for real.

746
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:53,957
You've got two hands and two feet.

747
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:55,244
How you gonna beat us all?

748
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,832
You're mistaken.

749
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:58,949
I have two hands but

750
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:01,082
Wing Chun has eight kicks.

751
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:02,999
Never mind your boys.

752
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:06,250
There's more than enough for you.

753
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,707
More than enough for me?

754
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,332
That one's free.

755
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:38,831
First kick.

756
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:00,578
Fourth kick.

757
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:14,949
One more left.

758
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:37,996
Do you remember our oath?

759
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:40,908
What oath?

760
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,491
I vow with all my heart

761
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,832
to be loyal

762
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:46,244
and obedient

763
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,741
to the Party.

764
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,161
I fear neither hardship

765
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:50,453
nor sacrifice.

766
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,790
Should I forsake these vows,

767
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:58,492
I accept the harshest punishment.

768
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,786
Fuck.

769
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,537
The war is over.

770
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:05,078
This is Hong Kong.

771
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:07,917
But we stand by our code -

772
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:09,957
Join us alive.

773
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:11,699
Leave us dead.

774
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:13,707
I'm leaving now.

775
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:15,703
Can you stop me?

776
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:18,124
Try us and see.

777
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:04,456
(In exile in Hong Kong, The Razor)

778
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:09,158
(ran the White Rose Barber Shop.)

779
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,994
(1950. Chinese New Year's Eve. Hong Kong)

780
01:21:11,417 --> 01:21:14,080
You don't look like you need a doctor.

781
01:21:14,417 --> 01:21:17,990
I'd like to see the 64 Hands again.

782
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:20,040
If you don't mind me saying -

783
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:21,749
You lost. I won.

784
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:24,991
Have a seat.

785
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,867
If you'd said that at the door,

786
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,323
I wouldn't have made it so easy

787
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:41,120
for you to get your dumplings.

788
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:44,748
Thank you.

789
01:21:52,917 --> 01:21:54,158
You know,

790
01:21:55,167 --> 01:21:58,615
I'd hoped to visit the Northeast in 1937.

791
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:02,116
There was a challenge waiting for me.

792
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:05,999
I had a warm coat made.

793
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:10,115
But the war stopped me from going.

794
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:13,369
I didn't keep the coat,

795
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:16,540
but I still have one of its buttons.

796
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,831
Call it a memento.

797
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,833
The 64 Hands is too important a legacy.

798
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:30,454
Why let it disappear?

799
01:22:33,917 --> 01:22:35,203
In centuries of martial arts history,

800
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,366
so many things

801
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,332
have vanished.

802
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:42,329
Why should the Gong Family arts survive?

803
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:48,415
Mr Ip,

804
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,870
no art is higher than Heaven

805
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,661
no gift more solid than Earth.

806
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:57,656
Nothing lasts forever and that's fine.

807
01:22:58,792 --> 01:23:00,499
Keep this button.

808
01:23:01,458 --> 01:23:04,530
As for what may and may not be seen,

809
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,661
let's not talk about it now.

810
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:15,911
Mr Ip, ten years ago on New Year's eve

811
01:23:15,917 --> 01:23:17,203
do you know where I was?

812
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:23,369
Mr Ip,

813
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,991
may I have a word?

814
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:32,202
The Gong arts belong to the Gong family.

815
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:35,826
The 64 Hands aren't there just for show.

816
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,832
The Gong Family lives.

817
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,957
I know how much talent is there.

818
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,287
I'm keen to learn.

819
01:23:43,542 --> 01:23:44,953
I'll be waiting.

820
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:11,996
People - they change with the times.

821
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,333
Wear shoes that suit the crossing,

822
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:18,076
and underpants that fit your ass.

823
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,957
In Hong Kong,

824
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:23,245
I can only afford these cigarettes.

825
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:26,324
Back home,

826
01:24:26,542 --> 01:24:28,750
I smoked real Manchurian tobacco.

827
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:30,665
Now that was smoking.

828
01:24:33,583 --> 01:24:36,655
Be mild, good, respectful, thrifty, deferential.

829
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:38,574
Deferential is the key.

830
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,332
Let's say I'm smoking.

831
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,333
A stranger sits down.

832
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:48,205
I defer to him: Have a smoke.

833
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:52,327
Even if he doesn't smoke, he must accept

834
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:54,495
or he'll make me lose face.

835
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,866
Mr Ip,

836
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:01,120
have a smoke.

837
01:25:06,208 --> 01:25:07,324
Thank you.

838
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:08,824
You're welcome.

839
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,866
You've got the gift.

840
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:55,825
Twenty years ago,

841
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:57,699
we could have sparred.

842
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,366
What a shame.

843
01:26:05,917 --> 01:26:08,876
Some work in the light,

844
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:10,787
others in shadow.

845
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,324
The face of a school must be spotless.

846
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:16,575
Blood must flow only in the shadows.

847
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:19,784
If not, if it stains the face,

848
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:22,454
then the school itself may perish.

849
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,208
The face offers the cigarettes.

850
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:28,621
The dirty work is done in the shadows.

851
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:33,164
Mr Ip, you're too late.

852
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:35,033
Forget the 64 hands -

853
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:38,166
you'll never see even one.

854
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:44,869
(1940. Chinese New Year's Eve. The Northeast.)

855
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:03,995
Is it hard to kill a man?

856
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:06,582
Miss Gong,

857
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:09,287
it's not like in the old days.

858
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:12,249
Murder is punishable by death.

859
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:16,747
Is Ma San worth it?

860
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:23,745
we make our own path in life.

861
01:27:24,917 --> 01:27:26,249
Should we go home,

862
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:28,578
or keep waiting?

863
01:27:33,042 --> 01:27:34,658
It's New Year's Eve.

864
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:37,499
He'll be here soon.

865
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:39,703
We have to wait.

866
01:27:41,042 --> 01:27:42,249
All right.

867
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:49,499
We'll wait.

868
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:31,073
This is between Miss Gong and Ma San.

869
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:33,750
Everyone else stay out of it.

870
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,415
There you are,

871
01:31:37,667 --> 01:31:39,829
still playing with your monkey.

872
01:31:41,542 --> 01:31:42,328
Deal with him!

873
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:43,574
Get him!

874
01:32:24,417 --> 01:32:25,953
You're worse than a debt collector,

875
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,750
trying to ruin my New Year's Eve.

876
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:32,450
The dumplings are in the pot,

877
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:35,159
but you won't be eating them.

878
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:38,457
I let you off before

879
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:42,823
to avoid destroying the Gong clan.

880
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:46,040
You should know when to give up.

881
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:48,870
Those needing salvation burn joss.

882
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:51,454
Those who are hungry, eat.

883
01:32:52,583 --> 01:32:53,824
What I must do,

884
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,287
I will do and nothing can stop me.

885
01:32:57,167 --> 01:32:58,829
The Gong Family legacy

886
01:33:00,042 --> 01:33:02,079
must return to me tonight.

887
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:03,823
Fine.

888
01:33:05,417 --> 01:33:08,706
It's a part of me.

889
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,624
You want it -

890
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,161
come and get it.

891
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,661
Master!

892
01:37:14,667 --> 01:37:16,704
Keep away.

893
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:21,165
Ma San,

894
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:22,203
speak!

895
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,328
That day,

896
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,786
the Old Master

897
01:37:41,167 --> 01:37:42,783
spoke to me

898
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,832
about his supreme move -

899
01:37:46,625 --> 01:37:48,617
Old Monkey Hangs up his Badge.

900
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:52,915
He said the key to the move

901
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:55,994
was turning back.

902
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:04,741
At the time,

903
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:09,082
I didn't get it.

904
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:14,494
I thought

905
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:16,874
he couldn't keep up with the times.

906
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:29,707
The Gong Family legacy

907
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,332
I return to you.

908
01:38:34,833 --> 01:38:36,495
Let's be clear.

909
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:39,324
You didn't return it.

910
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:43,166
I took it back myself.

911
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,661
Miss Gong!

912
01:40:08,792 --> 01:40:10,328
Miss Gong!

913
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:35,499
(1952. Hong Kong. White Rose Barber Shop)

914
01:40:46,042 --> 01:40:47,374
Sorry.

915
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:50,074
I miss my mom.

916
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:56,368
You got my notice about the memorial?

917
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:58,415
Yes.

918
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:03,040
Open a business, follow the rules.

919
01:41:04,417 --> 01:41:05,624
It's the same everywhere.

920
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:09,120
Do you know how much weight

921
01:41:10,208 --> 01:41:11,824
a summons from me carries?

922
01:41:15,167 --> 01:41:16,374
It's measured in gold.

923
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:21,743
Brother, I've got the money.

924
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:24,036
And I've got my life.

925
01:41:25,833 --> 01:41:27,415
Whichever is worth more,

926
01:41:28,292 --> 01:41:29,282
take it.

927
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:37,494
I like those eyes of yours.

928
01:41:39,792 --> 01:41:41,158
They remind me of my mom's.

929
01:41:41,417 --> 01:41:43,204
Want both? Or just one?

930
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:45,158
Not so fast.

931
01:41:47,708 --> 01:41:48,789
How about,

932
01:41:50,458 --> 01:41:52,074
you do the honors?

933
01:41:54,042 --> 01:41:55,499
Forget it.

934
01:41:57,042 --> 01:41:58,533
You're a real man.

935
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:03,119
It's the anniversary of my mom's death.

936
01:42:04,167 --> 01:42:06,284
I'll leave you those two lamps of yours.

937
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,913
As the rivers flow, we'll meet again.

938
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:12,494
I'll take my leave.

939
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:16,119
Want the money -

940
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:19,325
there're rules for that too.

941
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,412
What use are rules?

942
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:23,036
Keep it simple.

943
01:42:23,042 --> 01:42:25,159
I stab you three times then you stab me.

944
01:42:25,167 --> 01:42:26,408
How common.

945
01:42:26,417 --> 01:42:28,204
Then raise the tone.

946
01:42:32,792 --> 01:42:34,408
See that chair over there?

947
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:37,574
If I can't plant your ass there,

948
01:42:38,458 --> 01:42:41,246
keep the cash.

949
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:46,583
You're kidding, aren't you?

950
01:43:20,667 --> 01:43:21,908
Brother,

951
01:43:23,375 --> 01:43:25,958
here's your prayer money.

952
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:28,824
Next time you'll be joining your mom.

953
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:30,832
Off you go.

954
01:43:32,833 --> 01:43:34,165
To tell the truth,

955
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:39,658
Take me as a disciple!

956
01:43:40,208 --> 01:43:41,369
Teach you?

957
01:43:42,167 --> 01:43:43,874
It'd be a waste of my time.

958
01:43:47,667 --> 01:43:49,624
That's speaking honestly too.

959
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,036
Just a few pointers?

960
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,833
(That same year, The Razor began teaching.)

961
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:30,577
(Baji kungfu came to Hong Kong.)

962
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:52,574
In 1952, Gong Er stopped seeing patients.

963
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:56,413
Some say her old injury drove her to opium.

964
01:44:56,833 --> 01:44:59,200
Others that she was obsessed with kungfu.

965
01:45:00,333 --> 01:45:03,326
I last saw her at a teahouse.

966
01:45:43,792 --> 01:45:45,158
Do you know this opera?

967
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:48,579
I think I heard it before in Foshan.

968
01:45:50,167 --> 01:45:51,374
Something about a dream.

969
01:45:51,625 --> 01:45:52,991
A Dream of Love.

970
01:45:55,792 --> 01:45:57,579
Love is just that, a dream.

971
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:00,324
It's said

972
01:46:00,917 --> 01:46:03,955
no instrument is as lovely as a voice.

973
01:46:05,167 --> 01:46:08,660
Words always sound better sung.

974
01:46:08,667 --> 01:46:10,203
Has Miss Gong studied opera?

975
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:11,494
Just the basics.

976
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:24,500
Back then if I'd put my mind to it,

977
01:46:25,833 --> 01:46:27,745
I'd be an opera star.

978
01:46:28,292 --> 01:46:31,911
All those tales, happy and sad...

979
01:46:33,375 --> 01:46:35,207
If I tired of Yang Family Women Generals,

980
01:46:36,167 --> 01:46:38,329
I'd sing Waking from a Dream.

981
01:46:39,875 --> 01:46:40,991
Think of it -

982
01:46:43,167 --> 01:46:46,490
me on stage, you in the audience,

983
01:46:48,833 --> 01:46:50,745
meeting that way.

984
01:46:52,417 --> 01:46:53,703
Wouldn't that be something?

985
01:46:54,667 --> 01:46:56,329
But what if it was sold out?

986
01:46:57,542 --> 01:46:58,999
You flatter me.

987
01:47:00,083 --> 01:47:02,871
If you came, I'd save you a seat.

988
01:47:04,417 --> 01:47:08,331
You've performed well in the opera of life.

989
01:47:08,333 --> 01:47:10,996
You have both timing and skill.

990
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:12,999
Unfortunately,

991
01:47:14,167 --> 01:47:15,328
you never saw beyond your role.

992
01:47:18,708 --> 01:47:20,665
I'd no idea you watched me like an opera.

993
01:47:23,708 --> 01:47:25,074
This opera of mine,

994
01:47:25,917 --> 01:47:27,749
applauded or not,

995
01:47:28,333 --> 01:47:29,949
will play on to the end.

996
01:47:33,667 --> 01:47:35,283
I asked you

997
01:47:36,042 --> 01:47:37,874
here to bring things to a close

998
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:39,957
and say what needs to be said.

999
01:47:40,542 --> 01:47:41,703
Are you going somewhere?

1000
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:49,120
We have a saying in the North -

1001
01:47:50,208 --> 01:47:53,167
a tiger never quits the mountain.

1002
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:58,907
We've both been living on foreign soil.

1003
01:48:01,625 --> 01:48:03,241
I'm so very tired.

1004
01:48:04,458 --> 01:48:05,699
I want to go home.

1005
01:48:09,042 --> 01:48:12,114
But I wanted to return this to you first.

1006
01:48:29,792 --> 01:48:31,078
As for the 64 Hands,

1007
01:48:34,333 --> 01:48:35,995
I've already forgotten them.

1008
01:48:42,542 --> 01:48:47,867
I was lucky to meet you in my prime.

1009
01:48:52,542 --> 01:48:54,078
Sadly, my time is running out.

1010
01:48:56,458 --> 01:49:00,156
To say there are no regrets in life,

1011
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:03,325
is just to fool yourself.

1012
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,665
How boring it would be without regrets.

1013
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:20,823
Mr Ip, to tell you the truth,

1014
01:49:24,167 --> 01:49:26,079
I cared about you.

1015
01:49:35,167 --> 01:49:37,204
I don't mind telling you that.

1016
01:49:38,792 --> 01:49:40,249
It's not a crime to love.

1017
01:49:45,375 --> 01:49:47,458
But that's all it can ever be.

1018
01:49:52,208 --> 01:49:54,074
I never said that to anyone before.

1019
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:58,324
Seeing you tonight,

1020
01:49:59,417 --> 01:50:01,374
I don't know why, it just came out.

1021
01:50:09,292 --> 01:50:11,158
Let's say we suspend this game

1022
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:13,833
of chess between us.

1023
01:50:21,667 --> 01:50:23,033
Take care.

1024
01:50:34,458 --> 01:50:36,996
In life, as in chess,

1025
01:50:37,667 --> 01:50:39,533
a move once made stays on the board.

1026
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,207
What we have

1027
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:46,991
is simply fate.

1028
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,574
Your father once said,

1029
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,788
never give up the faith.

1030
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:01,991
Keep the light burning.

1031
01:51:05,292 --> 01:51:06,658
I hope that one day

1032
01:51:06,917 --> 01:51:09,284
I'll see the 64 Hands once more.

1033
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:19,700
My father said mastery had three stages -

1034
01:52:21,542 --> 01:52:22,828
being,

1035
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,081
knowing,

1036
01:52:26,708 --> 01:52:28,415
doing.

1037
01:52:31,375 --> 01:52:32,991
I know myself.

1038
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,457
I've seen the world.

1039
01:52:42,167 --> 01:52:43,783
Sadly, I can't pass on what I know.

1040
01:52:50,667 --> 01:52:52,329
This is a road

1041
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:54,832
I won't see to the end.

1042
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,537
I hope you will.

1043
01:53:23,542 --> 01:53:25,283
Is this street of schools

1044
01:53:26,625 --> 01:53:28,457
all the Martial World has come to be?

1045
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:31,324
A great age offers a choice:

1046
01:55:31,917 --> 01:55:34,580
stay or move on.

1047
01:55:35,833 --> 01:55:38,416
I choose to remain in my era,

1048
01:55:39,333 --> 01:55:41,325
the times when I was happiest.

1049
01:55:42,458 --> 01:55:45,906
(In 1953, Gong Er died in Hong Kong.)

1050
01:55:45,917 --> 01:55:49,035
(She kept her vows)

1051
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:53,286
(to the end.)

1052
01:56:06,917 --> 01:56:09,830
Tomorrow I take Miss Gong's coffin home.

1053
01:56:11,208 --> 01:56:12,665
She left this for you.

1054
01:56:15,167 --> 01:56:19,662
In imperial times I was an executioner.

1055
01:56:21,667 --> 01:56:25,707
The Republic left me out of a job.

1056
01:56:27,042 --> 01:56:29,455
Had Master Gong not taken me in,

1057
01:56:30,583 --> 01:56:32,666
I'd have landed in the gutter like a dog.

1058
01:56:35,167 --> 01:56:37,705
He never looked down on me.

1059
01:56:38,625 --> 01:56:41,288
He made me his daughter's guardian.

1060
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:44,996
My fierceness would protect her.

1061
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,448
He nicknamed me Lucky Star,

1062
01:56:51,583 --> 01:56:57,375
so fortune would shine on her always.

1063
01:57:05,833 --> 01:57:07,324
For a woman,

1064
01:57:07,708 --> 01:57:09,995
taking vows is a kind of death.

1065
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,616
To avenge her father,

1066
01:57:15,917 --> 01:57:19,911
she vowed never to marry or teach,

1067
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:22,074
to remain single her whole life.

1068
01:57:23,917 --> 01:57:25,499
She kept that vow.

1069
01:57:32,333 --> 01:57:33,824
These are the ashes

1070
01:57:34,125 --> 01:57:37,664
from when she cut and burnt her hair.

1071
01:57:40,458 --> 01:57:44,657
She said she knew you a long time,

1072
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:47,161
But you didn't really know her,

1073
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:48,831
nor she you.

1074
01:57:52,208 --> 01:57:53,870
Seeing these ashes,

1075
01:57:57,083 --> 01:57:58,665
you'll understand her better.

1076
01:58:04,333 --> 01:58:05,619
Mr Ip,

1077
01:58:06,833 --> 01:58:08,495
the Gong Family is through.

1078
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,949
Miss Gong belongs to you now.

1079
01:59:17,917 --> 01:59:19,374
Like her father,

1080
01:59:19,833 --> 01:59:22,416
Gong Er never lost a fight.

1081
01:59:24,667 --> 01:59:27,956
She only ever lost to herself.

1082
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:57,324
(1953. Ip Man gets his Hong Kong ID)

1083
01:59:57,333 --> 02:00:01,577
after the border to China is shut.

1084
02:00:30,042 --> 02:00:31,578
The day I left Foshan,

1085
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:33,707
I wanted to say something

1086
02:00:34,833 --> 02:00:36,290
but couldn't speak the words.

1087
02:00:38,083 --> 02:00:44,455
(My heart will carry me back to you.)

1088
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,162
When I left her that time,

1089
02:01:18,417 --> 02:01:20,158
I thought I'd be able to return.

1090
02:01:20,542 --> 02:01:23,034
But it was the last time I saw her.

1091
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:26,583
After that I only had the path ahead.

1092
02:01:26,583 --> 02:01:27,790
There was no turning back,

1093
02:01:29,667 --> 02:01:30,999
and no road home.

1094
02:01:34,167 --> 02:01:37,490
(In 1960, Zhang Yongcheng died of illness.)

1095
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:40,117
(Ip Man never returned to Foshan.)

1096
02:02:44,167 --> 02:02:46,375
Okay, begin.

1097
02:02:49,708 --> 02:02:50,619
Left fist

1098
02:02:50,625 --> 02:02:51,615
out,

1099
02:02:51,917 --> 02:02:52,998
palm open,

1100
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,332
turn the wrist,

1101
02:02:54,667 --> 02:02:55,657
pull back,

1102
02:02:55,667 --> 02:02:56,828
right fist,

1103
02:02:56,833 --> 02:02:57,823
out,

1104
02:02:57,833 --> 02:02:58,823
open,

1105
02:02:58,833 --> 02:02:59,949
twist the wrist,

1106
02:02:59,958 --> 02:03:01,324
pull back.

1107
02:03:13,167 --> 02:03:14,374
Mr Ip,

1108
02:03:15,667 --> 02:03:17,158
all encounters in this world

1109
02:03:18,292 --> 02:03:20,033
are a kind of reunion.

1110
02:04:17,167 --> 02:04:20,490
They say I popularized Wing Chun.

1111
02:04:20,833 --> 02:04:22,369
I hope they're right.

1112
02:04:22,833 --> 02:04:24,449
I never did it for fame.

1113
02:04:24,458 --> 02:04:26,415
The martial arts belong to all.

1114
02:04:26,958 --> 02:04:28,494
We're all on the same quest.

1115
02:04:29,292 --> 02:04:31,329
It all comes down to those two words -

1116
02:04:31,708 --> 02:04:33,324
Horizontal. Vertical.

1117
02:05:50,458 --> 02:05:55,158
(Ip Man was a huge inspiration to others.)
(Because of him,)

1118
02:05:55,167 --> 02:06:01,414
(the torch of Wing Chun)
(has been carried around the world.)
