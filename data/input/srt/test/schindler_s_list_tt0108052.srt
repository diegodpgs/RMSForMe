00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,811
- Name?
- Horowitz, Salomon.

3
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,110
- Schneider, Sarah.
- Birnbaum, Olga?

4
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,575
- Over there. Over there!
- Come here!

5
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,955
- Isak Hudes.
- Hudes, Isak.

6
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,165
Zucker, Helena.

7
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,835
Zucker, Helena!

8
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,838
- Hirsch, Salomon?
- Mandel, Maria.

9
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,424
- Hauptman, Chaim!
- Weisman! Weisman, Marcus!

10
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,427
- Feber, Ludwig!
- Feber, Ludwig.

11
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,597
Elsa Bauman.

12
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,058
-Josef Klein.
- Klein.

13
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,145
- Davidowich, Ignacy.
- Paula Biffer. - Nadel, Rachela.

14
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,898
- Steiner, Gertruda.
- Steiner, Hilda.

15
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,187
- Jerzy, you know who that man is?
- I don't know.

16
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,625
Let's get together, please.

17
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,587
Smile. Good!

18
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,369
Yes, sir.

19
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:13,248
Bring them over
a round of drinks.

20
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:18,545
Very good, sir.
And who shall I say they are from?

21
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,715
You can say
they are from me.

22
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:46,573
- From the gentleman.
- Where?

23
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,331
Do you know him?

24
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:59,002
-Find out who he is.
-Yes, sir!

25
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,843
Agnieszka, I would give anything
to hear you sing tonight...

26
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,720
...but I know you won't.

27
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,058
You embarrass me.

28
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,652
What's he doing?

29
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,031
Stay here.

30
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,786
How are you doing?

31
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:37,457
You'd leave a woman
alone at the table in a place like this?

32
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,752
Sweetheart, you're the picture
of loneliness.

33
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,924
What a lovely fragrance.
You are breaking my heart.

34
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,635
An extra chair, please.
Vodka for my friend.

35
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,929
- And for the lady?
- Pernod!

36
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:55,684
"There's a wood sale
in Green Forest... "

37
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,769
"... a wood sale!"

38
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,607
"Wood is being sold in the Green Forest. "

39
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,318
Come to the table, girls!
Drink with us!

40
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,779
"Left around the corner,
right around the corner... "

41
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,532
"... there is wood sale everywhere. "

42
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,660
Come to us!
Merry us!

43
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:23,253
"The whole trunk costs only one taler.
one taler. "

44
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:28,300
"The whole trunk costs only one taler,
one taler. "

45
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,264
- Thank you.
- I'll tell you what I mean by cooperative.

46
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,809
Two days after the law is passed
that all Jews have to wear the star...

47
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,103
...the Jewish tailors are
turning them out by the gross in a variety...

48
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,272
...of fabrics
at three zloty each.

49
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,982
Tell me about
your cellar wines.

50
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,945
- I have an excellent German Riesling, 1937.
- French!

51
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,281
- A Bordeaux. Chateau Latour, '28, '29?
- No, I'm sorry.

52
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,867
It's as if they have no idea
what kind of law it is.

53
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,411
As if it's the emblem
of a riding club.

54
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,413
- A Margaux, '29?
- No, no, we don't have that.

55
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,874
- Burgundy then? A Romanee-Conti, '37?
- Yes.

56
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,002
It's human nature.
"We'll do this to avoid that. "

57
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,755
That's what they have done
since thousands of years.

58
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,590
It's what they do.
They weather the storm.

59
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,344
But this storm is different. This is not
the Romans. This storm is the SS.

60
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,348
"If God wants to honor you... "

61
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:20,185
"... then he'll send you world wide. "

62
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:27,651
"If god wants to honor you
then he'll send you world wide. "

63
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,321
"Faleri, Falera... "

64
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:35,200
"... Faleri
Falera-ha ha ha!"

65
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:38,912
"Faleri, Falera!"

66
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,457
"He sends you away world wide"

67
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,045
-Martin?
-Yes, sir!

68
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,340
Who is that man?

69
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,052
That's Oskar Schindler!

70
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,514
"Faleri, Falera
ha ha ha!"

71
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,226
"He sends you away world wide. "

72
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,771
"Faleri, Falera!"

73
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,357
"He sends you away world wide. "

74
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,526
To Krakow!

75
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,233
<i>Attention, all Jews!</i>

76
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,986
<i>From now on, Jewish art...</i>

77
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:57,407
<i>...meat preparing is forbidden.</i>

78
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,870
<i>Announcement for all Jews!
From now on...</i>

79
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,891
- Rabbi...
- Private property cannot be confiscated.

80
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,018
- How long are the schools going to be closed?
- I do not know the answer..

81
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,355
- Article 47: Pillage is formally prohibited.
- You don't know anything!

82
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,315
- I am familiar with the Hague Convention.
- Religious...

83
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,736
They come into our house
and tell us we don't live there any more.

84
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,573
It now belongs
to a certain SS officer.

85
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,908
Please!
I only know what they tell me.

86
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:43,036
And what they tell me
changes from day to day!

87
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,498
Aren't you supposed
to be able to help?

88
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,668
I mean, what if I just
took this thing off?

89
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,504
- What are they going to do about it?
- They will shoot you.

90
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,675
- Why don't you stop this silly talk?
- Itzhak Stern!

91
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,970
I'm looking
for Itzhak Stern.

92
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,641
Are you Itzhak Stern or not?

93
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,936
- I am.
- Where can we talk?

94
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,491
There's a company
you did the books for, on Lipowa Street.

95
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,952
Made what?
Pots and pans?

96
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,122
By law, I have to tell you, sir,
I'm a Jew.

97
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,126
Well, I'm a German.
So there we are.

98
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,674
- A good company, you think?
- Modestly successful.

99
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,927
I know nothing about enamelware.
Do you?

100
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,846
I was just
the accountant.

101
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,848
Simple engineering though,
wouldn't you think?

102
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,433
Change the machines around,
whatever you do...

103
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,102
...you could make other
things, couldn't you?

104
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:54,024
Field kits, mess kits.
Army contracts.

105
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,403
Once the war ends,
forget it, but for now it's great.

106
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,405
You can make a fortune,
don't you think?

107
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:04,284
I think most people right now
have other priorities.

108
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,287
Like what?

109
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,581
I'm sure you'll do just fine,
once you get the contracts.

110
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,625
In fact, the worse things get,
the better you'll do.

111
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,420
Oh, well, I can get the signatures
I need. That's the easy part.

112
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,258
Finding the money
to buy the company, that's hard.

113
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,134
You don't have any money?

114
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:25,430
Not that kind of money.
You know anybody?

115
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,433
Jews, yeah.

116
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,144
Investors.
You must have contacts...

117
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,063
...in the Jewish business community
working here.

118
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,024
What community?
Jews can no longer own businesses.

119
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,027
- That's why this one's in receivership.
- But they wouldn't own it.

120
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,322
I'd own it. I'd pay them
back in product- pots and pans.

121
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,450
- Pots and pans!
- Something they can use.

122
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,160
Something they can
feel in their hands.

123
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,454
They can trade it on the black market,
do whatever they want.

124
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,165
Everybody's happy!

125
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,628
If you want, you could
run the company for me.

126
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,759
Let me understand.

127
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,512
They'd put up all the money,
I'd do all the work.

128
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:09,099
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?

129
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,226
I'd make sure it's known
the company's in business.

130
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,645
I'd see that it had
a certain panache.

131
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,941
That's what I'm good at.
Not the work, not the work.

132
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,360
The presentation!

133
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,674
I'm sure I don't know anybody
who'll be interested in this.

134
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,262
Well, they should be,
Itzhak Stern.

135
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,807
Tell them they should be.

136
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,277
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

137
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:08,700
<i>All Jews!
From now on, it's forbidden...</i>

138
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:25,259
I've got a client who'll sell marks
for zloty at 2.45 to 1.

139
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,553
Wool, mink collar.
It's a nice coat.

140
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,596
She'll trade it
for ration coupons.

141
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,058
- Wicks, for lamps.
- You have a truckload of wicks?

142
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,185
What am I going to do
with a truckload of wicks?

143
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,187
9 by 12, 9 by 14.

144
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,440
I don't know.
Big, beautiful, Persian.

145
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,905
-What?
- You don't recognize this?

146
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,366
-It's shoe polish.
-In metal containers?

147
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,450
You asked for shoe polish.

148
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,745
In metal containers.
This is glass, it's not what I asked for.

149
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,746
What's the difference?

150
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,874
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

151
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:00,627
My client sold it to his client,
who sold it to the German Army.

152
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:06,175
Only by the time it got there, because
of the freezing cold, it broke. All 10,000 units.

153
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,634
This is not my problem.

154
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,386
- This is not his problem.
- This is not your problem?

155
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,931
- This is not my problem.
- All right!

156
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,476
The German Army wants
to find out where it came from.

157
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,521
- I am going to make sure they find out.
- Now it's your problem.

158
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,232
You be quiet!

159
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,944
Metal containers.

160
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,363
Hello!

161
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,826
Pardon me for interfering,
but that's a nice shirt.

162
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,329
Nice shirt.

163
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,665
Do you know
where I can find a nice shirt like that?

164
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,716
Like this?

165
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,011
It's illegal to buy or sell
anything on the street.

166
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,848
We don't do that.
We're here to pray.

167
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,439
Do you have any idea
how much a shirt like this costs?

168
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,400
Nice things cost money.

169
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,873
How many?

170
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,294
I'm going to need some other
things, too, as things come up.

171
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,048
- This won't be a problem.
- From time to time.

172
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,593
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

173
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:16,346
- Name? Address?
- Fill in the forms!

174
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,224
Go on, go on!
Don't push each other!

175
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:22,352
- You come here!
- Stay there!

176
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,402
<i>Attention! Attention!
All Jews are enforced...</i>

177
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,989
<i>...to live in the Jewish district.</i>

178
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,452
<i>Not getting the residence
from the registry office...</i>

179
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:25,332
<i>...will be against decree 44/91
and judged through the military court.</i>

180
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,296
This is obviously the right place.
How are you doing?

181
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,429
Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!

182
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:43,433
Goodbye,Jews!
Goodbye,Jews!

183
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:47,771
<i>Goodbye, Jews!</i>

184
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:52,609
<i>Goodbye, Jews!
Goodbye, Jews!</i>

185
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,215
Oh, my God!

186
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,178
Oy, God!
Oh, my God!

187
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,228
Oh, my God!

188
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,196
It could not be better.

189
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,824
- It could be worse.
- How? Tell me.

190
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:44,661
How on earth
could it possibly be worse?

191
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,372
<i>Good morning!</i>

192
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,844
- Hey, Goldberg.
- Poldek.

193
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:05,265
- What's this?
- Uh, the Jewis assembly has its own police now.

194
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,976
- You don't say.
- Coordination service!

195
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,687
I'm a policeman now,
could you believe it? It's hard to believe.

196
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,814
Oh, no, it's not hard to believe.

197
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,983
It's a good racket, Poldek.
The only racket here.

198
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,695
Look, maybe I could put in
a good word for you with my superiors.

199
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:23,116
- Your superiors?
- Come on, they're not as bad as everyone says.

200
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:26,411
Well, they're worse than everyone says,
but it's a lot of money.

201
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,122
A lot of money!

202
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,959
Give me my housing assignment.

203
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:36,421
- Come on.
- You look funny in that hat, Goldberg.

204
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:40,008
You look like a clown, you know?

205
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,723
He's a very important man.

206
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,725
Just give him
two minutes of your time.

207
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:52,604
Since when did time cost money?
Just sit down and listen...

208
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,190
...please!
Sir?

209
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,445
For each thousand you invest,
I will repay you with...

210
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,447
- Two hundred.
- ... 200 kilos of enamelware a month...

211
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,908
...to begin in July
and to continue for one year.

212
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,745
After which time, we're even.
That's it. It's very simple.

213
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:11,790
- Not good enough.
- It's not good enough!

214
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,917
Not good enough?

215
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:18,213
Look where you're living. Look where
you've been put. "Not good enough! "

216
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,966
A couple of months ago
you'd be right, not anymore.

217
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:24,178
Money's still money.

218
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:29,933
No, it is not!
That's why we are here.

219
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:30,976
Trade goods...

220
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,645
...that's the only currency
that'll be worth anything in the ghetto.

221
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:37,065
Things have changed, my friend.

222
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,819
Did I call this meeting?

223
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,071
You told Mr Stern
you wanted to speak to me.

224
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,365
I'm here.
I've made you a fair offer.

225
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:50,412
Fair would be
a percentage in the company.

226
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:55,250
Forget the whole thing.
Get out!

227
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,966
How do we know
that you will do what you say?

228
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,635
Because I said I would.

229
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,845
You want a contract?
To be upheld by what court?

230
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:10,265
I said what I'll do.
That's our contract.

231
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,538
Five, six, seven...

232
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:36,041
...eight, nine...

233
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:52,474
The standard SS rate for Jewish
skilled labourers is seven marks a day...

234
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,435
...five for unskilled and women.

235
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,605
This is what you pay
the Reich Economic Office.

236
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,275
The Jews themselves
receive nothing.

237
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:05,737
Poles you pay wages.
Generally, they get a little more.

238
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:08,448
- Are you listening?
- What was that about the SS?

239
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:10,742
The rate? The what?

240
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:14,162
The Jewish worker's salary,
you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker.

241
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,373
- He gets nothing.
- But it's less.

242
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,625
- It's less than what I would pay a Pole.
- It's less?

243
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,753
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

244
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,464
Poles cost more.

245
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,635
Why should I hire Poles?

246
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:32,931
An enamelware factory,
over at, Lipowa Street.

247
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:36,059
It, uh, it, um...
It's owned by a German.

248
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,646
But it's outside the ghetto,
so you can barter for extra goods...

249
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,398
...for eggs, I don't know
what you need...

250
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,233
...with the Polish workers.
You can't get it here.

251
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,945
Also, he's asking for ten
healthy women for the...

252
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,655
I'm healthy!

253
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,658
Bring your sister, okay?

254
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:01,376
You need to convince them you have
a trade, something valuable to the war effort.

255
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,795
- Like what?
-I'm a musician. - What if you don't?

256
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:07,257
- Your name goes on a list.
- Your name is on the list, they put you on trucks...

257
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,384
- No, no, no, that's not true.
- You're a musician?

258
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,221
- Yeah.
- I'd find a good hiding place if I were you.

259
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:17,100
- I'm not going to hide like some animal.
- There are places to hide.

260
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,148
The next!

261
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:26,985
I'm a graduate
of the University of Lwow.

262
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,821
I used to work at the
hydroelectric station in Roznow...

263
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,740
Blue card!

264
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:39,289
I'm gonna get the necessary papers
because this card is no good any more.

265
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:42,000
You can stay in this line all day,
you'll still get one of these.

266
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,587
They are no good.
You'll have to leave the line now...

267
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:50,300
...then you'll get a blue card, a Blauschein,
to say that you are an essential worker.

268
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:53,595
I'll get these papers
for you at Pankiewicz.

269
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,889
Pharmacist.
Just there, look!

270
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,724
<i>Guess who is here?</i>

271
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,477
Poldek!
Enjoying the weather, Poldek?

272
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,188
- Enjoying the lines?
- Need some shoe polish?

273
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,774
In metal container maybe!

274
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:10,737
Not essential? I think you misunderstand
the meaning of the word.

275
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,073
No blue card, sir.
Stand over there.

276
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,909
Move. Next!

277
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,912
What do you mean,
"Not essential"?

278
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:25,210
I teach history and literature.
Since when it's not essential?

279
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,467
He's metal polisher.

280
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,935
- It was not right?
- It's very good. He's 53 years old.

281
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:45,314
- It's too new.
-Thank you.

282
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,949
You're crazy.
You left it in your drawer.

283
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,826
How many times
have I told you?

284
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:01,079
Your work certificate,
you keep in your pocket at all times.

285
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,915
And you leave everything
in your drawer.

286
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,626
How many times I've told you?

287
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,379
I'm a metal polisher!

288
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,557
<i>Take the round sheet of tin...</i>

289
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:24,686
...dip it in soap emulsion.

290
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:29,441
<i>Then place it centrally in the press.</i>

291
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:48,043
We obtain the soup pot.
The soup pot!

292
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:51,547
Soup pot!

293
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,842
Grosz, Mrs Grosz, stay together.

294
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,851
Look, sir, I have ten work permits here
for the German enamel factory...

295
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,020
...and signed by Mr Bankier
and myself.

296
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:11,900
<i>If it's carbonized,
clean it with a file.</i>

297
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:16,572
But don't touch both the electrodes
at the same time.

298
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:20,033
You'll get electrocuted.
Here, have a try.

299
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,331
Roll the metal
under the press...

300
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:28,917
...but be very careful
unless you want your fingers...

301
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:32,212
...to become part of the teapot!

302
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:37,092
- Occupation?
- I'm a writer. I play the flute.

303
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:40,512
But Moses is a skilled metalworker.

304
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:43,056
He can make tin pots.
He can make tanks.

305
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,058
He can make whatever
Mr Schindler asks.

306
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,769
He's highly skilled.
Give him your card.

307
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,480
Moses, give him your card.

308
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:57,654
<i>Now, dip the basin with the tongs
into the enamel solution.</i>

309
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:04,244
<i>And after swiveling it around,
carefully place it aside to drip-dry.</i>

310
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:10,542
And whatever he asks you, allow me
just to represent you and speak for you.

311
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,419
Don't say a word!

312
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:16,089
Filing, billing, keeping
track of my appointments, shorthand.

313
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:20,135
- Typing, obviously. How is your typing?
- Uh, all right.

314
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,262
Please!

315
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:18,986
You need a secretary.
Pick one.

316
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:23,991
I don't know how.
They're all so... qualified.

317
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,994
You have to choose.

318
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:32,040
Big smile, big smile!

319
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,981
If you would,
look after my guest.

320
00:30:56,106 --> 00:31:01,069
Um, boxed teas are good.
Coffee, pâté, um...

321
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:04,948
...kielbasa sausage,
cheeses, Beluga caviar...

322
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,075
...and, of course, who could live
without German cigarettes?

323
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:09,661
Get me as many
as you can find.

324
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,788
And some more fresh fruit.

325
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,833
The real rarities,
oranges, lemons, pineapples.

326
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,294
I need several boxes of Cuban cigars.
The best.

327
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:18,670
And dark unsweetened chocolate...

328
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,089
...not in the shape of ladyfingers,
the chunk chocolate.

329
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:24,134
Big as my hand,
you sample at wine tastings.

330
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:27,554
We're going to need lots of cognac.
The best, Hennessy.

331
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:32,643
Dom Perignon champagne.
Um, get L 'espadon sardines...

332
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:36,563
...and, oh,
try to find nylon stockings.

333
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:42,110
<i>It is my distinct pleasure
to announce...</i>

334
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:47,866
<i>...the fully operational status
of German enamel factory...</i>

335
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:52,579
<i>...manufacturers of superior
enamelware crockery...</i>

336
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:58,043
<i>...expressly designed
and crafted for military use.</i>

337
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,879
<i>Utilizing only
the most modern equipment...</i>

338
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:06,009
<i>...D.E.F.'s staff of highly skilled and
experienced artisans and journeymen...</i>

339
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:09,596
<i>...deliver a product
of unparalleled quality...</i>

340
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:13,642
<i>...enabling me to proffer,
with absolute confidence and pride...</i>

341
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,311
<i>...a full line
of field and kitchenware...</i>

342
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:20,482
<i>...unsurpassable in all respects
by my competitors.</i>

343
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:23,861
See attached list
and available colours.

344
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,073
Anticipating the enclosed bids
will meet with your approval...

345
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:32,035
...looking forward to a long and
mutually prosperous association...

346
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,205
...I extend to you in advance
my sincerest gratitude...

347
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:38,333
...and very best regards.
Oskar Schindler.

348
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,879
Yeah, I need 700 gross
from here for next Thursday.

349
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:44,673
Nine hundred,
no, make it ten for Wednesday.

350
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,761
All this stuff here goes to Madritsch's
factory on Tuesday of next week.

351
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:07,905
My father was fond of saying,
"You need three things in life... "

352
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:12,534
"... a good doctor,
a forgiving priest... "

353
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:15,370
"... and a clever accountant. "

354
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:22,836
The first two,
I've never had much use for.

355
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:26,381
But the third!

356
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:35,849
Just pretend, for Christ's sake!

357
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:42,105
Is that all?

358
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,113
I'm trying to thank you.

359
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:54,326
I'm saying I couldn't
have done this without you.

360
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,748
The usual thing would be
to acknowledge my gratitude.

361
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:04,711
It would also, by the way,
be the courteous thing.

362
00:34:04,837 --> 00:34:07,589
You're welcome.

363
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,017
Get out of here!

364
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:35,367
<i>Klonowska, who is it?</i>

365
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,880
She's so embarrassed.
Look at her.

366
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,643
You know something?
You would like her.

367
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,687
- Oskar, please!
- What?

368
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,190
I don't have to like her...
just because you do.

369
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:08,942
It doesn't work that way.

370
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,666
You've done well here.

371
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,671
You look wonderful.

372
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:37,095
- Be careful of the step, miss.
- Mrs Schindler, Marek.

373
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:53,403
- It's not a charade, all this?
- Charade? How could it be a charade?

374
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,239
- The clothes, the car, the apartment.
- Wait a minute.

375
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,450
Take a guess how many
people are on my payroll.

376
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,743
Oskar!

377
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:04,873
My father, at the height of his success,
had 50. I've got 350.

378
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:09,586
350 workers on the factory floor,
with one purpose.

379
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,713
To make pots and pans?

380
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:15,717
To make money.
For me!

381
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:25,602
Does anyone ask about me?

382
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:32,442
Back home?
Everybody. All the time.

383
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:42,202
They won't soon forget the name
Schindler here, I can tell you that.

384
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:46,081
"Oskar Schindler"
they'll say.

385
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:49,751
"Everybody remembers him. "

386
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:54,047
"He did something extraordinary. "

387
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:59,303
"He did something
no one else did. "

388
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:05,517
"He came here with nothing,
a suitcase...

389
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:11,690
"... and built a bankrupt
company into a major manufactory. "

390
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:14,943
"And left with
a steamer trunk... "

391
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:19,656
"... two steamer trunks
full of money. "

392
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,952
"All the riches of the world. "

393
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:29,541
It's comforting to see
that nothing's changed.

394
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,961
You're wrong, Emilie.

395
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:36,089
There's no way I could have
known this before but...

396
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:38,967
...there was always
something missing.

397
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:43,138
In every business I tried,
I can see now, it wasn't me that failed.

398
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,974
Something was missing.

399
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:49,686
Even if I'd known what it was,
there's nothing I could have done about it...

400
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:54,316
...because you can't
create this thing.

401
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:59,696
And it makes all the difference
in the world between success and failure.

402
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,324
Luck?

403
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,704
War!

404
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:34,898
Should I stay?

405
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:38,735
It's a beautiful city.

406
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:44,032
I asked you if I should stay.

407
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:47,786
It's up to you.

408
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,378
Promise me, Oskar.
No doorman or maitre d' will ever presume...

409
00:38:56,503 --> 00:39:01,884
...I'm anyone other
than Mrs. Schindler, and I'll stay.

410
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,346
Goodbye, darling.

411
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:27,075
I could try to read this
or I could eat my lunch while it's still hot.

412
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,077
We're doing well?

413
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,495
- Yes.
- Better this month than last?

414
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,789
- Yes.
- Any reason to think next month will be worse?

415
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,667
The war could end.

416
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,680
- What?
- There is a machinist outside...

417
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,850
...who'd like to thank you
personally for giving him a job.

418
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:57,105
Every day he comes. He's very grateful.
It'll just take a minute.

419
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:05,405
Mr Lowenstein!

420
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:15,415
I want to thank you, sir...

421
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,168
...for giving me
the opportunity to work.

422
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:21,255
You're welcome.
I'm sure you're doing a great job.

423
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:25,592
The SS beat me up.
They would have killed me...

424
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:30,347
...but I am essential
to the war effort, thanks to you.

425
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,432
That's great.

426
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,768
I work hard for you.

427
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:39,273
- I'm sure you do.
- I'll continue to work hard for you.

428
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,316
That's great. Thanks.

429
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,735
- God bless you, sir.
- All right.

430
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:47,614
You are a good man.

431
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:52,077
- He saved my life.
- Yes, he did.

432
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:55,747
- God bless him.
- Yeah. Come on.

433
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,918
God bless you!

434
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,641
I'm sorry, Herr Direktor,
but you're running very late.

435
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:18,228
This is for the major, sir.

436
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:21,231
And this is for his niece, Greta.
It's her birthday.

437
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:24,067
- Greta as in Garbo.
- Don't ever do that to me again.

438
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:26,695
Go. Go, go, drive!
Don't bow.

439
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,782
- Did you notice that man had one arm?
- Did he?

440
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:37,664
- What's his use?
- Very useful.

441
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:43,670
- How?
- Very useful! Success!

442
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,117
<i>You'll be given brooms and shovels...</i>

443
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,246
<i>...each of you will grab one
and start cleaning the street.</i>

444
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:20,290
We'll be late for work.

445
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:34,888
You shouldn't
think of them as yours, Oskar.

446
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:36,890
You need to understand that
some of the officers here...

447
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,726
...don't give a damn
about production.

448
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,897
To them, it's a matter of,
um, national priority...

449
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:46,441
...that Jews
be made to shovel snow.

450
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,902
<i>It's got nothing to do
with reality, Oskar.</i>

451
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:51,071
<i>You know it and I know it.</i>

452
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:53,448
<i>Jews shoveling snow!</i>

453
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:58,203
<i>It's got a, um,
ritual significance.</i>

454
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:03,333
- Come with me.
- I am an essential worker.

455
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,086
- Essential worker?
- Yes.

456
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:12,634
- I work for Oskar Schindler.
- Essential worker for Oskar Schindler.

457
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,180
- A one-armed Jew? Twice as useless!
- Yes, yes.

458
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:20,225
I lost a day
of production, Rolf.

459
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,520
<i>I work for Oskar Schindler.</i>

460
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:27,649
Danka, look at the snow.
Look at the snow. Look at the snow!

461
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:35,532
I lost a worker.
I expect to be compensated.

462
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:38,535
File a grievance with the
Economic Office. It's your right.

463
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,372
- Would it do any good?
- Of course not!

464
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,836
A big shot from the SS Budget
and Construction Office came to lunch...

465
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:52,216
...and he told us that to believe
the Jewish skilled worker had a place...

466
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:56,970
...in Reich economics
was a treasonable idea.

467
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:05,229
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?

468
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,273
He was a metal press operator.

469
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:14,404
Quite skilled.

470
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,435
Mr. Director!

471
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:47,896
Shit. I don't believe it.

472
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:50,274
Stern, is that you?

473
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:54,444
No, it's Poldek.
It's about Stern.

474
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:58,448
<i>Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

475
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:00,617
<i>Clearly label it.</i>

476
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:04,913
<i>Given name first,
then your surname.</i>

477
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:07,583
<i>Do not bring
your baggage with you.</i>

478
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:10,502
<i>It will follow you later.</i>

479
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:13,922
<i>Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

480
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:15,799
<i>Clearly label it.</i>

481
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:19,928
<i>Leave your luggage
on the platform.</i>

482
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,347
Stern?

483
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:28,061
- He's on the list.
- He is?

484
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:31,064
- Well, let's find him.
- I'm sorry. You can't have him.

485
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,942
He's on the list. If he were an essential
worker, he would not be on the list.

486
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:36,904
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?

487
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:40,073
- Sir, the list is correct.
- I didn't ask you about the list.

488
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:44,244
- I asked you your name.
- Klaus Tauber.

489
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:46,371
Tauber!

490
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:50,250
Squad leader, this gentleman
thinks a mistake's been made.

491
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,086
My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.

492
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:55,005
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production...

493
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,257
...and the Armaments Board
will want to know why.

494
00:45:57,257 --> 00:45:59,927
-Attention! The train is about to leave.
-Is he on the list?

495
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:04,223
Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

496
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:10,020
Well, the list is correct, sir.
There is nothing I can do.

497
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:12,981
- What is your name?
-Close and secure all doors.

498
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:16,527
- My name? My name is Kunder.
- This train is now leaving.

499
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:18,987
- Kunder.
- Hauptscharführer Kunder.

500
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:21,031
- K-U-N-D-E-R.
- And what's yours?

501
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:23,283
Schindler.
S-C-H-I-N-D-L-E-R.

502
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:25,702
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

503
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:28,413
I think I can guarantee you
you'll both be in...

504
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:32,167
...Southern Russia
before the end of the month. Good day.

505
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:37,297
Stern!

506
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,299
- Stern!
- Stern!

507
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,343
Itzhak Stern!

508
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:50,435
Stern!
Itzhak Stern!

509
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:53,188
- Stern! Stern!
- Itzhak Stern!

510
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:57,985
-Stern!
-Sir!

511
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:02,197
- Stern!
- Herr Direktor!

512
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:05,200
My apologies.

513
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:08,203
- Stop the train! He's here!
- I apologize.

514
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:13,208
- Stop the train!
- Stop the train! Stop it!

515
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:29,516
Sign here. Initial there.

516
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:34,062
Makes no difference to us,
you understand. This one, that one.

517
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:36,356
It's the inconvenience to the list.

518
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:40,235
- It's the paperwork.
- I somehow left my work card at home.

519
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,072
I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...

520
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:48,243
- ... I'm sorry, it was stupid!
- What if I got here five minutes later?

521
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:50,996
Then where would I be?

522
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:45,068
I woke up from a dream
this morning.

523
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:49,364
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know...

524
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:55,495
...only to discover I was broke and
sharing a room with 12 people I didn't know.

525
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:58,207
- You laugh about it?
- I have to laugh.

526
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:00,918
You are living behind walls.

527
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:06,089
The walls I can deal with.
It's the restrictions to my life I'm tired of.

528
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,842
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.

529
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:12,095
I like it here.
There's a kind of, I don't know...

530
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:14,431
...ancestral squalor to it all.

531
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:16,683
- You are a slave to these people.
- No one envies us any more.

532
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,936
- I'm smart!
- Oh, yes, you're smart!

533
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:21,271
- You're a real genius.
- You had your chance.

534
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:25,984
Today, today I actually found time
to organize a thought.

535
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:28,862
I can't remember
the last time I did that.

536
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:30,739
When's the last time
we did this?

537
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:33,325
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?

538
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,745
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.

539
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,122
No one took my business
away from me.

540
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:41,250
You don't really have
a business to take.

541
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,585
There's nowhere down from here.

542
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,963
This is it.
This is the bottom.

543
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:50,008
The ghetto is,
liberty!

544
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:59,309
This street divides the ghetto
just about in half.

545
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:04,731
Right side, Ghetto A:
Civil employees...

546
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:07,734
...industrial workers and so on.

547
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:12,781
Left side, Ghetto B:
Surplus labour...

548
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:15,617
...the elderly and infirm mostly.

549
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:18,161
Which is where you'll
want to start, huh?

550
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,622
Do you have any questions, sir?

551
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:24,042
Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.

552
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:28,630
We expect a labor force of
25.000 to 30.000.

553
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,092
Segregated of course.
The men in the barracks near the guarry...

554
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:34,761
-... the women on the other side of the wire.
-My place is where?

555
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:36,638
-There, sir.
-There?

556
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,600
-Yes, the villa.
-You call that a villa?

557
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:41,643
- Their synagogue, can you see it?
- That's not a villa!

558
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:45,647
- We' to turn it into the camp stables.
- It's a house!

559
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:48,775
What's that over there?

560
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,070
Playground.
Fifty-one.

561
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:56,783
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.

562
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:02,539
There they are, sir.

563
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:10,214
One of you is, uh,
a very lucky girl.

564
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:14,092
There is an opening for a job...

565
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:18,013
...away from all this,
backbreaking work...

566
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:21,683
...at my new villa.

567
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:23,143
Uh...

568
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:29,399
...which of you has
domestic experience?

569
00:52:32,277 --> 00:52:36,573
Yeah, on second thought,
I don't really want someone else's maid.

570
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:40,118
All those annoying habits
I have to undo.

571
00:52:44,873 --> 00:52:47,751
I don't want
to give you my cold.

572
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:49,878
Uh, what's your name?

573
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:52,422
- Helen Hirsch.
- What?

574
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:54,299
Helen Hirsch.

575
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:59,012
- What? I can't hear.
- Helen Hirsch.

576
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:17,030
- Yes!
- Take it all down!

577
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:19,199
<i>-Back to your work!
-To work!</i>

578
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:23,453
<i>Take it down! It is not safe!</i>

579
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:26,915
She says the foundation was
poured wrong. She's got to take it down.

580
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:30,043
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.

581
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:34,381
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!

582
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:38,760
Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation...

583
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:41,597
...has to be torn down
and repoured.

584
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:45,058
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence...

585
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:47,769
...at the southern end
of the barracks.

586
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,397
Subsidence, and then collapse.

587
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:53,233
- And you are an engineer?
- Yes!

588
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,777
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate...

589
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:58,238
...of Civil Engineering
from the University of Milan.

590
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:02,784
Ah, an educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.

591
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:13,545
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

592
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,674
- Shoot her.
- What?

593
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:22,262
Commander!
I'm only trying to do my job.

594
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:23,972
Yeah, I'm doing mine.

595
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:26,517
Sir, she's foreman
of construction.

596
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:28,977
We are not going to have arguments
with these people.

597
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:31,104
Okay!

598
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:36,443
No!
Shoot her here, on my authority!

599
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:52,292
-It will take more than that.
-I'm sure, you are right!

600
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:03,720
Take it down, repour it,
rebuild it. Like she said.

601
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:08,016
We have more to see, but we have
only one more hour of light.

602
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:22,364
<i>Today is history.</i>

603
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:26,326
<i>Today will be remembered.</i>

604
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:34,209
Years from now, the young
will ask with wonder about this day.

605
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:39,923
Today is history,
and you are part of it.

606
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:42,593
Six hundred years ago...

607
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:46,471
<i>...when elsewhere they were putting
the blame for the Black Death...</i>

608
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:50,225
...Kazimiers The Great,
so called...

609
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:53,604
...told the Jews
they could come to Krakow.

610
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:56,231
- Chaja, bread.
- They came.

611
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:59,484
- Not that fat. No, less.
- They trundled their belongings into the city.

612
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:02,362
- Yes, a bit less.
- They settled...

613
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:07,201
<i>...they took hold.
They prospered...</i>

614
00:56:07,326 --> 00:56:12,372
<i>...in business, science,
education, the arts.</i>

615
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:15,417
<i>They came here with nothing.</i>

616
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,669
<i>Nothing!</i>

617
00:56:18,837 --> 00:56:21,381
<i>And they flourished.</i>

618
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:27,221
<i>For six centuries
there has been a Jewish Krakow.</i>

619
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:30,516
<i>Think about that.</i>

620
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:32,643
<i>By this evening...</i>

621
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:36,939
<i>...those six centuries
are a rumour.</i>

622
00:56:37,564 --> 00:56:40,526
They never happened.

623
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:44,571
Today is history!

624
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:07,302
Get off and line up
in a two row!

625
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,722
Come on, quicker!

626
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:18,897
I think we will start,
with Ghetto B.

627
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:29,741
- All right?
- Start from both sides?

628
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:32,494
- No, no! I would like you to start there.
- The right side?

629
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:35,205
-And then move around.
- All right!

630
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:42,045
<i>Label them clearly.
They will follow you later on.</i>

631
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:46,633
<i>Leave your luggage!</i>

632
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:50,345
<i>Label them clearly.</i>

633
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:53,974
<i>They'll follow you later on.</i>

634
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:56,685
- Open up!
- Lakoom.

635
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,794
<i>Come down!</i>

636
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:51,990
<i>Jews, all out!</i>

637
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:01,625
<i>Put on something warm
and come out.</i>

638
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:10,133
<i>To Chodi Square!</i>

639
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:22,604
Gold, Chaim!
Go to Chodi Square.

640
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:25,983
- Gold, Chaim!
- Yes, Chaim Gold.

641
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:28,443
Shoot him!

642
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:40,205
<i>Put on something warm
and go to Chodi Square.</i>

643
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:43,375
No baggage!
No baggage!

644
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:47,671
<i>-Go through.
-No baggage! No baggage!</i>

645
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:50,507
Hey, little boy.
How old are you, huh?

646
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:54,511
Huh, what's your name?
What's your name, huh?

647
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:57,181
I said, no luggage!

648
00:59:57,306 --> 00:59:59,641
Don't pack, no luggage!

649
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:02,895
Go to Chodi Square!
Leave your luggage here!

650
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:05,939
- Blue card!
- Chodi Square!

651
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:07,941
What's this bag doing here?

652
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:11,069
Everybody to Chodi Square!

653
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:31,548
We're getting out through the sewers.
I have to check if they're clear.

654
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:34,259
- Mila, pack some things. Nothing bigger...
- I can't go in the sewers.

655
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:38,555
I told you
I won't go in the sewers.

656
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:45,103
You can go. Yes, you can.

657
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:48,982
I won't go in the sewers.

658
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:04,248
-Move!
-Over there! Over there! Move!

659
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:06,583
Your card, Jew?

660
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:08,710
Your papers, Jew?

661
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:11,713
Your papers, Jew!

662
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:15,300
That line!

663
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:17,010
Your papers?

664
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:20,430
I'm not going up
because of your goddamn papers!

665
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:24,893
Your goddamn papers!

666
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:45,330
Why are you shooting?
Are you crazy?

667
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:48,041
In this traffic,
you could have shot me!

668
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,335
The bullet passed me by so close!

669
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:53,213
-Sorry!
-Now you say sorry? You're crazy!

670
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:56,592
<i>Stay away! Stay away!</i>

671
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:04,349
<i>Don't talk, don't talk!
Just go to the trucks!</i>

672
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:07,352
<i>Keep on walking, keep on walking!
Don't talk!</i>

673
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:19,239
<i>Come here, you fuckin' Jew!</i>

674
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:21,783
<i>Stand still!
I said, stand still!</i>

675
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:21,969
She's good as dead.
Leave her.

676
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:25,639
Give me a moment.
Just let me bring her inside.

677
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:34,857
You can join her,
or join the line.

678
01:03:39,194 --> 01:03:42,030
- Women to the left!
- Wilhelm! - Rose!

679
01:03:42,072 --> 01:03:44,575
-Men to right.
-Women to the left!

680
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:47,661
- Women to the left.
- Let me go! I won't leave my husband!

681
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:56,170
Women to the left,
and men to the right.

682
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:01,341
Your government
is in the wrong country!

683
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:09,349
Mama! Mama!

684
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:59,566
Mila!

685
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:26,885
Oh, God, Danka!

686
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:34,893
- You have a blue card.
- Blue card doesn't matter any more.

687
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:38,313
- They are cleaning out the ghetto.
- There's not enough room for you.

688
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:42,150
What are you talking about? We tried it
before. There's more than enough room.

689
01:05:42,192 --> 01:05:45,195
- I changed my mind!
- Mama!

690
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:49,741
Look at the space in there.
Now look at me. You are just scared.

691
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:52,035
I can fit the girl, but not you.

692
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:54,621
- Mama, I'm coming out!
- Stay where you are.

693
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:56,874
I'd rather you be here
than who knows where.

694
01:05:56,915 --> 01:05:59,042
<i>Mama!</i>

695
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:21,648
Commander!

696
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:23,358
Very good saluting.

697
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,362
I respectfully report I've been given orders
to clear the bundles from the road.

698
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:30,365
So there will be no obstructions
to the thoroughfare.

699
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:35,954
Finish and join the lines,
little Polish clicking soldier.

700
01:06:57,851 --> 01:06:59,853
Mrs. Dresner?

701
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:01,980
Yes.

702
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:04,399
Oh, you are a friend
of my son's.

703
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:06,568
Don't worry, I'll go quietly.
I'll be no trouble.

704
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:11,281
No, get under the stairs. They'll be done
searching soon. You'll be safe there.

705
01:07:11,281 --> 01:07:14,701
- Please hide! Please!
- Warmed by the sun.

706
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:17,162
Hide under the stairs!

707
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:21,834
I've searched the building.
There's no one here.

708
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:26,004
- Okay, then we're going to the next block.
-Understood!

709
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:35,430
- Danka!
- Mama!

710
01:07:40,894 --> 01:07:43,021
Hello, Adam.

711
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:45,315
Hello, Danka.

712
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:55,200
Come with me.
I will put you in the good line.

713
01:07:57,035 --> 01:08:00,205
Do you know the saying,
"An hour of life is still life"?

714
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:04,626
You are not a boy any more.
I'm saying a blessing for you.

715
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,143
Oh, please, let's go.
Let's go, please!

716
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:47,312
Come on!

717
01:10:56,089 --> 01:10:58,091
Mark it...

718
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:00,260
...mark it!

719
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:31,226
- What is it? Is it Bach?
- No, no. It's Mozart.

720
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:33,353
- Mozart?
- Yes!

721
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:56,543
- Can we still manage today?
- No way!

722
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,300
We can't manage it.

723
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:06,845
I wish this fucking
night were over.

724
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:48,554
<i>Appeal!
Line up! In rows of five!</i>

725
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:51,431
<i>Line up!</i>

726
01:13:53,016 --> 01:13:56,019
<i>Line up!</i>

<i>Come on, in rows of five!</i>

728
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:03,443
Caps off!

729
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:06,905
Sort the names!

730
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:10,659
Those who're announced will raise
their hands and shout a clear "Yes"!

731
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:13,453
<i>Yes!</i>

732
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:17,165
<i>Yes!</i>

733
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:20,502
- Keller, Fanni!
- Yes!

734
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:25,048
- Adalbert, Hermann!
- Yes!

735
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:27,509

-Warmberger, Markus!
-Yes!

738
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:38,645
Edelstein, Max!

739
01:14:56,538 --> 01:14:59,124
Disband!

740
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:04,838
The worst is over.
We are workers now.

741
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:39,122
<i>No excuses!</i>

742
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:47,005
Oh, God, Amon!

743
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:56,014
<i>Go to your barracks immediately!</i>

<i>Come here, come here!</i>

01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:43,478
<i>Come on, come here!</i>

746
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:49,359
Amon, you're
such a damned fuckin' child!

747
01:16:49,484 --> 01:16:51,945
Wakey, wakey.

748
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:05,250
- Make coffee.
- Make it yourself.

749
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:24,811
<i>The SS will manage
certain industries itself inside Plaszow.</i>

750
01:17:24,811 --> 01:17:27,272
<i>A metalworks, brush factory...</i>

751
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:30,442
<i>...another for reprocessing
jewish clothing from the ghettos...</i>

752
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:33,111
<i>...for use by
bombed-out families back home.</i>

753
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:36,573
But it's private industry like yours
that stands to benefit most...

754
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:39,284
...by moving inside the wire of
Commandant Amon Goeth's camp...

755
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:41,995
No, no, no. Sit, sit.
Julian, how are you?

756
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:43,455
Good to see you, my friend.

757
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:46,583
- Oskar Schindler.
- Leo John.

758
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:53,131
- Franz, good to see you.
- Hello, Oskar. Glad you could join us.

759
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:56,718
- My pleasure. Julius.
- How are you? You lost weight.

760
01:17:56,844 --> 01:18:00,722
Only in the shoulders.
Please, everybody, sit down.

761
01:18:00,764 --> 01:18:03,433
How are you doing?
Oskar Schindler.

762
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:08,605
- We started without you.
- Fine. I miss anything good?

763
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:11,900
I was explaining to Herr Bosch
and Herr Madritsch...

764
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:14,862
...some of the benefits of moving
their factories into Plaszow.

765
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:17,573
I meant the food.

766
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:23,620
Since your labour is housed on-site,
it's available to you at all times.

767
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:26,456
You can work them
all night if you want.

768
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:30,919
Your factory policies, whatever they've
been in the past, they'll continue to be.

769
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:33,213
They'll be respected.

770
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:37,509
I have to know, where do you get a suit
like that? What is that? Is that silk?

771
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:39,511
Of course!

772
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:43,932
Yeah, it's, it has a nice sheen
about it.

773
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:45,934
- Thank you.
- Very nice.

774
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:49,688
I'd say I'd get you one, but the man
who made it is probably dead.

775
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:52,357
I don't know.

776
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:56,111
<i>I go to work the other day.</i>

777
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:58,322
<i>Nobody's there.</i>

778
01:18:58,363 --> 01:19:02,075
<i>Nobody tells me about this.
I have to find out. I have to go in.</i>

779
01:19:03,076 --> 01:19:05,787
<i>Everybody's gone.</i>

780
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:07,956
No!

781
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,959
No!

782
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,131
They're not gone.
They're here.

783
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:21,303
They're mine!
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money.

784
01:19:21,386 --> 01:19:24,264
Every worker that is shot costs me money.
I have to find somebody else.

785
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:25,140
I have to trade them!

786
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,268
We are going to be making so much
money that none of this is going to matter.

787
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:31,855
It's bad business.

788
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:44,701
Thank you.

789
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:47,287
Leave the bottle.

790
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,749
Take that.

791
01:19:50,874 --> 01:19:54,461
Lena, thank you.

792
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:07,182
Scherner told me
something else about you.

793
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:11,436
Yeah? What's that?

794
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:16,316
That you know the meaning
of the word "gratitude. "

795
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:19,736
That it's not some vague thing with you...

796
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:23,073
...like it is with others.

797
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:26,618
You want to stay where you are.

798
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:29,913
You've got things
going on the side.

799
01:20:29,913 --> 01:20:32,040
Things are good.

800
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:36,628
You don't want anybody
telling you what to do.

801
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:41,216
I can understand all that,
you know? I know you.

802
01:20:43,302 --> 01:20:48,640
What you want...
is your own sub-camp.

803
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:57,357
Do you have any idea what is involved?
The paperwork alone?

804
01:20:57,357 --> 01:21:01,945
You've got to build the fucking thing. Getting
the fucking permits is enough to drive you crazy.

805
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:05,657
Then the engineers show up, they stand
around, they argue about drainage, foundations...

806
01:21:05,782 --> 01:21:11,121
...codes, exact specifications, fences 4
kilometres long, 1,200 kilograms of barbed wire...

807
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:14,541
...6,000 kilograms of electrified
fences, ceramic insulators...

808
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:16,126
...three cubic metres
of air space per prisoner.

809
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:20,380
I'm telling you, you want to shoot
somebody. I've been through it. I know.

810
01:21:20,506 --> 01:21:24,259
Well, you know.
You've been through it.

811
01:21:26,386 --> 01:21:29,431
You could make things
easier for me.

812
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:34,394
I'd be grateful.

813
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:40,275
<i>Clear the road!</i>

814
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:54,414
<i>Keep moving!
Keep moving!</i>

815
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:03,298
<i>-Keep moving!
-Turn left!</i>

816
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:12,266
Where's Stern?

817
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:19,439
Goldberg and Chilowicz,
make sure I see my cut...

818
01:22:19,606 --> 01:22:23,026
...from the, uh,
factory owners in this camp...

819
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:26,446
...leaving you to take care
of my main account...

820
01:22:26,572 --> 01:22:29,867
...the Schindler account.

821
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:34,037
He wants his independence.
I gave it to him.

822
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:37,040
But independence costs money.

823
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:40,043
This you understand?

824
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:46,466
Look at me!

825
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:01,231
Don't forget
who you are working for now.

826
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:13,785
<i>- Yes!
- Make sure he stays. He's a slippery bastard!</i>

827
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:17,664
<i>Yes!
Now, girls, everyone.</i>

828
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:23,128
- We need more wine.
- More wine!

829
01:23:23,253 --> 01:23:26,840
<i>Stand on my friend.
Don't let him leave.</i>

830
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:46,401
- What happens in life...
-Cheers, cheers!

831
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:51,323
Thank you, Mr. Director.

832
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:53,408
Cheers, Mr. Director!

833
01:23:57,579 --> 01:24:01,124
- What are you doing?
- What? Scratching my head.

834
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:05,587
Makes them think we have lice.
Helps make them keep their distance.

835
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:08,173
- Do you have lice?
- Do you have your notebook?

836
01:24:08,298 --> 01:24:11,885
The calendar on my desk has the birthdays
of our SS friends' wives and children.

837
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:14,304
Don't forget to send something.

838
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:18,016
Record pay-offs to the Main Administration
and Economics Office, the Armaments...

839
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:20,477
- Slowly, Stern, slowly.
- The Armaments Board...

840
01:24:20,602 --> 01:24:25,023
...Governor General's Division of the
Interior and Chief of Police as "fees"...

841
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,192
...and make them
on the first of each month...

842
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:29,736
...as opposed to individual pay-offs
to our SS contacts.

843
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,864
The list is
in the lower drawer of my desk...

844
01:24:31,864 --> 01:24:34,992
-... which you...
-"First of month... "

845
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,744
SS contacts: List, lower drawer
of my desk, which you handle...

846
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:42,207
...as cash contributions to legitimate
charities sent to each official's office.

847
01:24:42,332 --> 01:24:45,752
Dealings with our black market contacts,
listed as suppliers...

848
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:48,755
-... in the legitimate ledger, are more complicated.
- Forget it!

849
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:53,218
- What do you mean, you can't forget it!
- It gives me a headache!

850
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:03,353
- I couldn't get you out of here.
- I'll be all right.

851
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,774
Anyway, I'm here almost every week.
Wednesdays, usually.

852
01:25:07,941 --> 01:25:11,486
I'll look in on you,
see how you're doing.

853
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:16,950
Here,
put these in your pocket.

854
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:19,077
Come on!

855
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:27,544
Mr. Director, don't let things fall apart.
I've worked too hard.

856
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:40,557
Thanks for...
Good luck!

857
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:04,706
Attention! Caps off!

858
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:17,469
-Work!
-Back to work!

859
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:35,654
-What are you making?
-Hinges, sir!

860
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:41,618
Yeah, I've got some workers coming in
tomorrow. Where are they from again?

861
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:43,745
Yugoslavia, Mr. Commander!

862
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:46,331
I've got to make room.

863
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:52,337
- Make me a hinge.
- Yes, sir!

864
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:26,788
Keep going, you're doing well.

865
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:28,957
Says he's doing well.

866
01:27:35,547 --> 01:27:38,258
Oh, that's very good.

867
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:42,095
But I'm a bit confused,
and perhaps you can help me.

868
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:45,849
What I don't understand
is that you've been working...

869
01:27:45,849 --> 01:27:50,395
.. since I think, what,
about 6.00 this morning?

870
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:55,567
Yet such a small pile of hinges.

871
01:28:24,721 --> 01:28:27,724
- Oh, Christ.
- May I try that, sir?

872
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:30,018
Check the angle lever.
Maybe it's bent.

873
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:33,438
No, no. You wouldn't hear a click
if it was the angle lever.

874
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:35,983
- Maybe the pin shaft is greasy.
- Yeah, come on.

875
01:28:36,024 --> 01:28:39,194
What did I just say?
Here.

876
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:43,323
Mr. Commander!

877
01:28:43,323 --> 01:28:48,912
I beg to report that my heap
of hinges was so unsatisfactory...

878
01:28:48,996 --> 01:28:53,041
...because the machines
were being recalibrated this morning.

879
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:57,921
I was put on to shoveling coal.

880
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:23,822
Strange, huh?

881
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:25,949
Yeah!

882
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:33,832
Thank you, Muek.

883
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:37,669
Ah, Lisiek. Don't touch the leather,
it's just been oiled.

884
01:29:37,794 --> 01:29:39,630
- Squad leader!
- Oh, for me?

885
01:29:39,671 --> 01:29:43,383
-Oh, thank you very much, Mr Director.
-Mr. Director!

886
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:46,094
Mr. Director!

887
01:29:48,555 --> 01:29:51,141
Mr. Director!

888
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:54,269
<i>He was making hinges slowly.</i>

889
01:29:54,269 --> 01:29:59,566
So the man can turn out a hinge in
less than a minute. Why the long story?

890
01:30:28,303 --> 01:30:31,306
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome!

891
01:30:34,476 --> 01:30:38,438
- Nobody knows who stole the chicken?
- Tell him about the chicken.

892
01:30:38,438 --> 01:30:43,318
A man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this.

893
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:45,904
Save yourselves.

894
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:48,448
<i>Tell him about the chicken.</i>

895
01:31:04,047 --> 01:31:06,216
Still nobody knows?

896
01:31:17,811 --> 01:31:21,648
It was you!
You committed this crime!

897
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:24,109
- No, sir.
- But you know who, though.

898
01:31:24,234 --> 01:31:26,528
- Yes.
- Who?

899
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:29,656
Him!

900
01:31:33,076 --> 01:31:36,955
- He's very gifted.
- Yeah, sure. Bring him over.

901
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:43,670
Sir, thank you.

902
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:52,554
- Thank you again, Mr. Director!
- You're welcome again.

903
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,140
It's an honour to work
for such a great company.

904
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,225
It's great to have you!

905
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:59,978
I promise to learn everything there's
to know about enamelware production.

906
01:31:59,978 --> 01:32:01,522
That's great!

907
01:32:13,116 --> 01:32:17,412
- Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here.
- I only need five minutes.

908
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:20,290
She wants to speak
to Mr. Director.

909
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:42,020
Yes.

910
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:49,027
He won't see you.

911
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:21,226
Please, sit down.

912
01:33:24,354 --> 01:33:27,608
- Pernod? Cognac?
- Uh, no. No, thank you.

913
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:32,070
So, what can I do for you?

914
01:33:36,074 --> 01:33:38,660
They say that no one dies here.

915
01:33:38,785 --> 01:33:42,331
They say your factory is a haven.

916
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:46,251
They say you are good.

917
01:33:49,254 --> 01:33:51,548
Who says that?

918
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:53,800
Everyone.

919
01:34:00,098 --> 01:34:02,559
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.

920
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:06,230
I've been living in Krakow
on false papers since the ghetto massacre.

921
01:34:06,271 --> 01:34:07,856
My parents are in Plaszow.

922
01:34:07,981 --> 01:34:12,444
Their names are
Chana and Jakob Perlman.

923
01:34:12,569 --> 01:34:16,281
They are older people. They are killing
older people now in Plaszow.

924
01:34:16,281 --> 01:34:20,577
They bury them
up in the forest. Look...

925
01:34:20,702 --> 01:34:23,413
...I don't have any money.

926
01:34:23,455 --> 01:34:26,959
I, I borrowed these clothes.

927
01:34:29,127 --> 01:34:31,171
I'm begging you.

928
01:34:31,296 --> 01:34:35,050
Please, please
bring them here.

929
01:34:35,175 --> 01:34:37,636
I don't do that.

930
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:41,431
You've been misled.
I ask one thing:

931
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:45,018
Whether or not a worker
has certain skills.

932
01:34:45,185 --> 01:34:47,604
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

933
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:52,192
Such activities are illegal.
You will not entrap me!

934
01:34:52,317 --> 01:34:56,446
Cry, and I will have you arrested.
I swear to God!

935
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:08,750
People die.
It's a fact of life.

936
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:12,504
He wants to kill everybody? Great!
What am I supposed to do about it?

937
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:15,340
Bring everybody over?
Is that what you think?

938
01:35:15,465 --> 01:35:18,343
Send them over to Schindler.
Send them all!

939
01:35:18,468 --> 01:35:22,222
His place is a haven,
didn't you know? It's not a factory.

940
01:35:22,347 --> 01:35:24,516
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.

941
01:35:24,641 --> 01:35:27,352
It's a haven for rabbis
and orphans...

942
01:35:27,477 --> 01:35:30,939
...and people with
no skills whatsoever!

943
01:35:32,816 --> 01:35:35,235
You think
I don't know what you're doing?

944
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,947
You're so quiet all the time.
I know, I know!

945
01:35:38,947 --> 01:35:41,658
- Are you losing money?
- That's not the point!

946
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:47,080
- What other point is...
- It's dangerous! It's dangerous to me!

947
01:35:49,917 --> 01:35:53,545
You have to understand.
Goeth is under enormous pressure.

948
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:56,965
You have to think of it
in his situation.

949
01:35:57,299 --> 01:35:59,968
He's got this
whole place to run.

950
01:35:59,968 --> 01:36:02,679
He's responsible
for everything here, all these people.

951
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:06,099
He's got a lot of things
to worry about.

952
01:36:06,308 --> 01:36:10,145
And he's got the war
which brings out the worst in people.

953
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:13,732
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.

954
01:36:15,984 --> 01:36:20,572
But in normal circumstances he
wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right.

955
01:36:20,697 --> 01:36:24,117
There'd just be the good
aspects of him which...

956
01:36:24,993 --> 01:36:27,996
He's a wonderful crook.

957
01:36:27,996 --> 01:36:32,417
A man who loves good food,
good wine, the ladies, making money...

958
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:34,753
Killing!

959
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:37,589
He can't enjoy it.

960
01:36:37,714 --> 01:36:40,759
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped...

961
01:36:40,884 --> 01:36:43,887
...from a work detail
outside the wire.

962
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:47,724
Goeth lined up everybody
from the missing man's barracks.

963
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:51,728
He shot the man to the left of Bejski,
the man to the right of him.

964
01:36:51,728 --> 01:36:55,732
He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.

965
01:37:00,737 --> 01:37:03,323
Twenty-five!

966
01:37:07,202 --> 01:37:10,914
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Nothing, nothing.

967
01:37:10,914 --> 01:37:13,333
We're just talking.

968
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:26,930
"Perlman. "

969
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,642
Perlman!

970
01:37:31,518 --> 01:37:33,520
Husband and wife.

971
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:37,774
Jakob and Chana Perlman!

972
01:37:50,662 --> 01:37:53,957
Have Goldberg bring them over.

973
01:37:55,834 --> 01:37:59,254
<i>Caps off!</i>

974
01:37:59,254 --> 01:38:01,381
<i>Ready for inspection!</i>

975
01:38:49,054 --> 01:38:53,308
I'm sure this will be better
than those rags, Lisiek.

976
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:57,187
Mr. Director, I was just
helping Lisiek to find something...

977
01:38:57,271 --> 01:39:00,315
...to clean the stains
from the Commander's bathtub.

978
01:39:00,315 --> 01:39:03,318
- Go clean it.
- Pardon me, Sir!

979
01:39:06,905 --> 01:39:10,200
You don't have to report to me, Helen.

980
01:39:10,284 --> 01:39:13,203
You know who I am?

981
01:39:21,211 --> 01:39:24,506
I'm Schindler.

982
01:39:24,631 --> 01:39:28,177
Of course. I, I have heard and...

983
01:39:28,343 --> 01:39:31,513
...you have been here before.

984
01:39:33,223 --> 01:39:36,059
Here, why don't you
keep this someplace?

985
01:39:36,101 --> 01:39:39,646
- Go on, take it.
- I get extra food here.

986
01:39:39,771 --> 01:39:45,110
Well, if you don't want to eat it,
trade it. Or give it to Lisiek.

987
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:49,656
Why not build yourself up?

988
01:39:54,077 --> 01:39:57,998
My first day here, he beat me...

989
01:39:58,081 --> 01:40:02,085
...because I threw out
the bones from dinner.

990
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:09,843
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...

991
01:40:09,968 --> 01:40:12,679
...he asked me where they were.

992
01:40:15,098 --> 01:40:19,686
For his dogs, you understand?

993
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:26,109
I said to him, I,
I don't know how I say this.

994
01:40:26,109 --> 01:40:29,696
I never could say it now,
I said to him...

995
01:40:29,696 --> 01:40:33,116
..."Why are you beating me?"

996
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:39,122
He said, "The reason
I beat you now...

997
01:40:39,122 --> 01:40:43,418
...is because you ask
why I beat you. "

998
01:40:45,003 --> 01:40:47,881
I know your sufferings, Helen.

999
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,719
It doesn't matter.

1000
01:40:54,471 --> 01:40:57,432
I have accepted them.

1001
01:40:57,474 --> 01:40:59,726
Accepted them?

1002
01:41:01,603 --> 01:41:03,313
One day he will shoot me.

1003
01:41:03,438 --> 01:41:06,316
No, no, no, no,
he won't shoot you.

1004
01:41:06,316 --> 01:41:10,028
I know. I see things.

1005
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:13,615
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I...

1006
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:17,619
and we saw the Commander
come out of the front door and...

1007
01:41:17,744 --> 01:41:22,499
...and down the steps by the patio
right there below us and...

1008
01:41:22,624 --> 01:41:27,504
...and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he...

1009
01:41:27,629 --> 01:41:30,924
...shot a woman
who was passing by.

1010
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:35,304
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.

1011
01:41:35,345 --> 01:41:39,057
Just-Just a woman
on her way somewhere, you know.

1012
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:42,811
She was no fatter or thinner...

1013
01:41:42,936 --> 01:41:45,355
...or slower or faster
than anyone else...

1014
01:41:45,397 --> 01:41:50,527
...and I couldn't guess
what had she done.

1015
01:41:53,947 --> 01:41:57,367
The more you see
of the Commander...

1016
01:41:57,534 --> 01:42:02,706
...the more you see there is
no set rules that you can live by.

1017
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:08,921
You can't say to yourself,
"If I follow these rules, I will be safe. "

1018
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:15,552
He won't shoot you
because he enjoys you too much.

1019
01:42:15,802 --> 01:42:19,848
He enjoys you so much
he won't even let you wear the star.

1020
01:42:19,973 --> 01:42:25,270
He doesn't want anyone else
to know, it's a Jew he's enjoying.

1021
01:42:28,106 --> 01:42:35,113
He shot the woman from the steps
because she meant nothing to him.

1022
01:42:35,405 --> 01:42:41,537
She was one of a series
neither offending or pleasing him.

1023
01:42:43,997 --> 01:42:47,167
But you, Helen!

1024
01:42:51,004 --> 01:42:56,301
It's all right.
It's not that kind of a kiss.

1025
01:43:01,265 --> 01:43:03,183
Thank you!

1026
01:43:07,896 --> 01:43:09,773
Here!

1027
01:43:15,654 --> 01:43:18,198
Right, the wine!

1028
01:43:25,038 --> 01:43:28,792
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.

1029
01:43:36,508 --> 01:43:39,970
Why do you drink that motor oil?

1030
01:43:40,053 --> 01:43:42,806
I send you
good stuff all the time.

1031
01:43:42,931 --> 01:43:46,810
Your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.

1032
01:43:46,935 --> 01:43:49,646
You know, I look at you...

1033
01:43:49,771 --> 01:43:52,232
...I watch you!

1034
01:43:54,651 --> 01:43:56,069
You're never drunk.

1035
01:43:57,070 --> 01:43:59,698
Oh, that's...

1036
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:02,910
...that's real control.

1037
01:44:03,076 --> 01:44:05,412
Control is power.

1038
01:44:06,246 --> 01:44:08,790
That's power.

1039
01:44:12,377 --> 01:44:16,548
Is that why they fear us?

1040
01:44:17,549 --> 01:44:21,261
We have the fucking power to kill,
that's why they fear us.

1041
01:44:21,428 --> 01:44:25,265
They fear us because
we have the power to kill arbitrarily.

1042
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:27,518
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.

1043
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:30,270
We have him killed,
and we feel pretty good about it.

1044
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:34,566
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.

1045
01:44:35,692 --> 01:44:38,570
That's not power, though.

1046
01:44:38,695 --> 01:44:43,408
That's justice.
It's different than power.

1047
01:44:45,702 --> 01:44:50,874
Power is when we have
every justification to kill...

1048
01:44:50,999 --> 01:44:53,585
...and we don't.

1049
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:56,421
You think that's power?

1050
01:44:58,298 --> 01:45:01,593
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something...

1051
01:45:01,593 --> 01:45:03,178
...he's brought in
before the emperor...

1052
01:45:03,303 --> 01:45:07,432
...he throws himself
down on the ground, he begs for mercy.

1053
01:45:07,474 --> 01:45:11,019
He knows he's going to die.

1054
01:45:13,021 --> 01:45:17,192
And the emperor, pardons him.

1055
01:45:17,609 --> 01:45:21,864
This worthless man.
He lets him go.

1056
01:45:24,324 --> 01:45:27,327
I think you are drunk.

1057
01:45:28,453 --> 01:45:31,456
That's power, Amon.

1058
01:45:31,456 --> 01:45:35,502
That, is power!

1059
01:45:42,509 --> 01:45:46,471
Amon the good!

1060
01:45:48,348 --> 01:45:51,351
I pardon you!

1061
01:45:58,650 --> 01:45:59,776
What do they want?

1062
01:45:59,818 --> 01:46:03,238
I don't know, but they're in my office
right now reviewing our books.

1063
01:46:03,322 --> 01:46:06,658
As my accountant, tell me,
should I be alarmed...

1064
01:46:06,783 --> 01:46:09,369
...that the auditors
are reviewing my books?

1065
01:46:09,411 --> 01:46:12,122
- Or have you done your job properly?
- You needn't be alarmed.

1066
01:46:12,247 --> 01:46:14,416
I needn't be alarmed!

1067
01:46:18,837 --> 01:46:21,840
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Do you know how much this saddle is worth?

1068
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:25,260
Do you know how much it costs?

1069
01:46:29,264 --> 01:46:31,266
All right!

1070
01:46:32,976 --> 01:46:35,103
All right!

1071
01:46:38,398 --> 01:46:42,110
Stern, what the hell are you
doing following me around?

1072
01:46:51,286 --> 01:46:54,122
<i>Barracks one, eleven...</i>

1073
01:46:54,289 --> 01:46:56,750
<i>...fifteen and thirty-two...</i>

1074
01:46:56,875 --> 01:47:00,003
<i>...apply to inspection area.</i>

1075
01:47:29,032 --> 01:47:31,618
She was smoking on the job.

1076
01:47:34,329 --> 01:47:37,583
Tell her not to do it again.

1077
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:55,767
I have to report, sir...

1078
01:47:56,185 --> 01:48:00,522
...I've been unable to remove
the stains from your bathtub.

1079
01:48:03,775 --> 01:48:07,946
- What are you using, Lisiek?
- Soap, Commander.

1080
01:48:09,907 --> 01:48:12,910
Soap? Not lye?

1081
01:48:21,543 --> 01:48:25,839
Go ahead, go on, leave.
Leave, I pardon you.

1082
01:48:47,694 --> 01:48:50,405
I pardon you!

1083
01:50:41,683 --> 01:50:45,270
Although I am not a rabbi,
in these circumstances...

1084
01:50:45,395 --> 01:50:48,106
...I pray to the Almighty
that he will forgive me...

1085
01:50:48,106 --> 01:50:51,276
...if I intone the blessings.

1086
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:46,039
So...

1087
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:50,335
...this is where you come
to hide from me.

1088
01:51:50,627 --> 01:51:54,047
I came to tell you...

1089
01:51:54,339 --> 01:52:01,054
...that you, um, you really are
a wonderful cook and a well-trained servant.

1090
01:52:01,054 --> 01:52:05,517
I mean it. If you need a reference
after the war...

1091
01:52:05,517 --> 01:52:10,898
...I'd be, I'd be happy
to give you one.

1092
01:52:11,523 --> 01:52:13,233
It must get lonely down here
when you're..

1093
01:52:13,358 --> 01:52:18,363
...listening to everyone upstairs
having such a good time.

1094
01:52:24,536 --> 01:52:26,788
Does it?

1095
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:30,959
You can answer.

1096
01:52:32,961 --> 01:52:37,382
But what's the right answer?
That's what you're thinking:

1097
01:52:37,382 --> 01:52:40,385
"What does he want to hear?"

1098
01:52:45,557 --> 01:52:50,687
The truth, Helen,
is always the right answer.

1099
01:52:52,397 --> 01:52:54,983
Yes, you're right.

1100
01:52:55,108 --> 01:52:58,570
Sometimes
we're both lonely.

1101
01:52:58,570 --> 01:53:01,573
Yes. I...

1102
01:53:02,866 --> 01:53:05,869
...I mean...

1103
01:53:12,167 --> 01:53:15,587
...I would like so much to...

1104
01:53:15,587 --> 01:53:20,175
...reach out and touch you
in your loneliness.

1105
01:53:20,342 --> 01:53:24,304
Wh- what would that be like,
I wonder? I mean...

1106
01:53:24,721 --> 01:53:27,432
...what would be wrong with that?

1107
01:53:27,474 --> 01:53:31,186
I realize that you're not
a-a person in the...

1108
01:53:31,311 --> 01:53:35,440
...the strictest sense
of the word, but...

1109
01:53:35,899 --> 01:53:39,194
No, maybe you're right
about that too, you know, maybe what's...

1110
01:53:39,319 --> 01:53:42,739
...what's wrong isn't...

1111
01:53:42,781 --> 01:53:45,450
...it's not us!

1112
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:47,911
It's, no, it's this!

1113
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:54,501
I mean, when they
compare you to...

1114
01:53:54,585 --> 01:53:58,755
...to, uh, vermin
and to rodents and to lice...

1115
01:54:01,508 --> 01:54:03,927
...I just, uh...

1116
01:54:06,513 --> 01:54:09,516
No, no, you,
you make a good point.

1117
01:54:09,516 --> 01:54:12,936
You make a very good point.

1118
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:23,697
Is this the face of a rat?

1119
01:54:25,949 --> 01:54:30,078
Are these the eyes of a rat?

1120
01:54:31,663 --> 01:54:34,833
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1121
01:54:49,723 --> 01:54:54,978
I feel for you, Helen.

1122
01:55:10,744 --> 01:55:13,872
No, I don't think so.

1123
01:55:15,123 --> 01:55:18,710
You're a Jewish bitch!

1124
01:55:19,461 --> 01:55:24,466
You nearly talked me into it,
didn't you?

1125
01:55:28,887 --> 01:55:31,473
Bravo!

1126
01:55:53,453 --> 01:55:57,332
-Bravo!
- Cheers! Cheers!

1127
01:56:05,757 --> 01:56:12,222
On behalf of the, of the workers, sir,
I, I wish for you a happy birthday.

1128
01:56:12,222 --> 01:56:13,932
Happy birthday!

1129
01:56:13,932 --> 01:56:15,517
Well, the staff, please.

1130
01:56:15,601 --> 01:56:19,646
Thank you very much
for the lovely cake.

1131
01:56:38,081 --> 01:56:42,544
Thank you very much.
Tell them "Thank you" from me.

1132
01:56:57,726 --> 01:57:02,397
The trains arrived and the people
were driven out with clubs.

1133
01:57:02,397 --> 01:57:06,568
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.

1134
01:57:06,693 --> 01:57:10,697
One was marked "Cloak Room"
and the other "Valuables. "

1135
01:57:10,697 --> 01:57:13,116
And there they
were made to undress.

1136
01:57:13,283 --> 01:57:17,746
A Jewish boy handed them pieces
of string to tie their shoes together.

1137
01:57:18,288 --> 01:57:20,582
They shaved their hair.

1138
01:57:20,582 --> 01:57:25,587
They told them it was needed to make
something special for U-boat crews.

1139
01:57:25,963 --> 01:57:29,883
And then they were herded
down a big corridor...

1140
01:57:30,008 --> 01:57:34,012
...to bunkers with
Stars of David on the doors...

1141
01:57:34,179 --> 01:57:38,016
...and signs that said
"Bath and Inhalation Room"

1142
01:57:38,183 --> 01:57:40,310
SS gave them soap.

1143
01:57:40,435 --> 01:57:46,191
They told them to breathe all the time
because it's good for disinfecting.

1144
01:57:46,316 --> 01:57:49,611
And then they gassed them.

1145
01:57:49,736 --> 01:57:52,906
Mila, why soaps?

1146
01:57:53,031 --> 01:57:54,908
So that they would agree
to go in, I think.

1147
01:57:55,033 --> 01:57:58,745
Come on, Mila, stop it.
Your bedtime stories are scaring everyone.

1148
01:57:58,912 --> 01:58:01,331
- I just don't believe it.
-Ja. You know it's ridiculous.

1149
01:58:01,456 --> 01:58:03,500
- I don't believe it either.
- I cannot believe it.

1150
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:07,045
-I didn't say I believed it. I said I heard it.
-From who?

1151
01:58:07,045 --> 01:58:09,798
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.

1152
01:58:09,923 --> 01:58:14,595
You know, if they were there,
they would have been gassed.

1153
01:58:14,803 --> 01:58:18,056
- Yes!
- It doesn't make any sense.

1154
01:58:18,056 --> 01:58:20,225
We're their workforce.

1155
01:58:20,225 --> 01:58:24,062
What sense does it make
to kill your own workforce?

1156
01:58:24,062 --> 01:58:29,067
To go to all this trouble
of assembling a workforce only to...

1157
01:58:29,067 --> 01:58:32,529
No, it can't be true.

1158
01:58:32,613 --> 01:58:35,699
We are very, very
important for them.

1159
01:58:35,991 --> 01:58:38,827
Yes, we do now!
Goodnight.

1160
01:58:38,952 --> 01:58:42,497
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Sweet dreams.

1161
01:58:50,964 --> 01:58:53,550
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

1162
01:58:53,675 --> 01:58:56,094
<i>Everyone who is alive...</i>

1163
01:58:56,094 --> 01:58:59,681
<i>...is to come to the roll-call area!</i>

1164
01:58:59,723 --> 01:59:04,269
- Attention, attention!
- We have to go to the roll-call area!

1165
01:59:04,269 --> 01:59:06,104
- Everyone who is alive...
The list makers are here.

1166
01:59:06,104 --> 01:59:08,857
- ... is to come to the roll-call area.
- There is going to be a selection.

1167
01:59:08,857 --> 01:59:13,278
<i>Attention, attention.
Everyone who is alive...</i>

1168
01:59:13,403 --> 01:59:17,282
<i>...is to come to the roll-call area!</i>

1169
01:59:31,839 --> 01:59:33,423
-Gentlemen!
-Gentlemen!

1170
01:59:37,427 --> 01:59:39,596
100.000 Hungarian is coming.

1171
01:59:41,723 --> 01:59:45,602
<i>All stand in a single row!</i>

1172
01:59:45,727 --> 01:59:49,731
You could afford
to lose some weight, Amon.

1173
01:59:49,898 --> 01:59:52,442
And you've got to
cut down on the cognac.

1174
01:59:52,484 --> 01:59:55,445
Morning.
What's going on?

1175
01:59:55,487 --> 01:59:58,448
It's another
semi-annual physical.

1176
02:00:00,325 --> 02:00:05,080
- There!
-I've got another shipment coming in of...

1177
02:00:05,205 --> 02:00:07,332
What are they this time?

1178
02:00:07,457 --> 02:00:09,334
- Hungarians.
- Oh, yeah, Hungarians!

1179
02:00:09,501 --> 02:00:13,964
We've got to separate the sick
from the healthy to make room.

1180
02:01:11,855 --> 02:01:13,440
Look alive, Rebeka.

1181
02:01:13,565 --> 02:01:15,692
<i>Quicker!</i>

1182
02:01:36,296 --> 02:01:38,882
That's my mechanic.

1183
02:01:39,174 --> 02:01:42,594
Whose bright idea was it
to get rid of him?

1184
02:02:45,532 --> 02:02:48,535
No, no, no!
Wait, go away. She can work.

1185
02:02:48,619 --> 02:02:52,372
Come here. Look,
separate the sick from the healthy.

1186
02:02:52,372 --> 02:02:54,833
Those who can work
and those who can't. She can work.

1187
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:59,129
You can work, you can come.

1188
02:03:38,001 --> 02:03:40,420
<i>On your feet!
On your feet!</i>

1189
02:04:24,214 --> 02:04:29,636
Those not selected for transport,
put your clothes back on.

1190
02:04:29,761 --> 02:04:34,766
- Go back to the barracks.
- Return to the barracks.

1191
02:04:40,355 --> 02:04:42,524
<i>Go back to the barracks!</i>

1192
02:04:45,944 --> 02:04:48,655
Oh, my God!

1193
02:05:10,677 --> 02:05:15,098
- Olek? Olek?
- Danka?

1194
02:05:15,098 --> 02:05:20,103
Olek? Olek?

1195
02:05:20,145 --> 02:05:23,690
Olek! Olek!

1196
02:05:29,863 --> 02:05:32,866
- Olek?
- Danka?

1197
02:05:32,866 --> 02:05:34,868
- Danka?
- Olek?

1198
02:05:34,868 --> 02:05:37,996
Back to the barracks!
Go back to your barracks!

1199
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:42,000
- I didn't see him!
- They're hiding. I'm telling you, they're hiding.

1200
02:05:42,167 --> 02:05:45,712
I know Danka. She knows a good place.
She took all of them together.

1201
02:05:45,712 --> 02:05:48,423
<i>Back to the barracks!</i>

1202
02:06:08,026 --> 02:06:13,740
Find your own hiding place. There's
no room for you here. Go away, quick!

1203
02:06:37,222 --> 02:06:40,934
Get out. This is our place.
Get out!

1204
02:07:03,957 --> 02:07:07,377
- Oskar!
- Amon! Gentlemen!

1205
02:07:07,377 --> 02:07:10,797
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried to call you. Here, Hujar, move.

1206
02:07:10,839 --> 02:07:13,675
- Quite a picnic, huh? Madritsch!
- Oskar!

1207
02:07:13,675 --> 02:07:16,428
They're running a little late.
It's taking longer than I thought.

1208
02:07:16,553 --> 02:07:19,389
- A drink?
- Something cold. Bowle.

1209
02:07:19,431 --> 02:07:22,100
The Bowle!

1210
02:07:23,727 --> 02:07:26,980
Oh, another beautiful day.

1211
02:07:40,118 --> 02:07:42,579
The loading of the
transport wagons is finished.

1212
02:07:42,579 --> 02:07:44,998
We can start!

1213
02:07:45,123 --> 02:07:47,584
Water! Water!

1214
02:07:47,584 --> 02:07:50,712
Water, water!

1215
02:07:58,136 --> 02:08:01,014
- To your health!
- Oh, thank you.

1216
02:08:06,895 --> 02:08:12,192
What do you say we get your fire hoses out
here and hose down the cars? Thank you.

1217
02:08:15,070 --> 02:08:17,322
Indulge me!

1218
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:20,450
- Hujar!
- Yes, sir!

1219
02:08:20,576 --> 02:08:24,621
- Go bring the fire hoses.
- Where's the fire?

1220
02:08:27,749 --> 02:08:31,336
<i>In the windows.
That's it, that's it.</i>

1221
02:08:31,461 --> 02:08:35,507
<i>On the roof. That's it, good, good.
In the window, in the window.</i>

1222
02:08:38,635 --> 02:08:42,347
Come on. Come on.

1223
02:08:42,347 --> 02:08:44,349
That's it, more, more!

1224
02:08:49,229 --> 02:08:52,524
That's it, that's it.
More, more!

1225
02:08:52,524 --> 02:08:56,236
This is really cruel, Oskar.
You are giving them hope.

1226
02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:00,073
You shouldn't do that.
That's cruel!

1227
02:09:00,115 --> 02:09:03,660
Come on, try and
reach the far end. Look out!

1228
02:09:03,785 --> 02:09:06,788
<i>Water!- More water!</i>

1229
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:12,961
I've got some 200 metre
hoses back in Emalia.

1230
02:09:13,086 --> 02:09:14,963
I have 20 metres
at home in my garden.

1231
02:09:15,088 --> 02:09:17,257
We can reach the cars at the end.

1232
02:09:17,257 --> 02:09:19,718
What? What?

1233
02:09:24,264 --> 02:09:26,975
- Hujar!
- Yeah, sure.

1234
02:09:45,410 --> 02:09:47,704
Don't forget the roof!

1235
02:09:47,871 --> 02:09:50,582
On the roof
on the other side.

1236
02:09:50,707 --> 02:09:55,003
<i>Water!</i>

1237
02:09:57,464 --> 02:10:00,300
Lieutenant,
every time the train stops...

1238
02:10:00,425 --> 02:10:02,135
...you open the doors,
you give them water, yeah?

1239
02:10:02,177 --> 02:10:05,430
- Okay!
- Okay!. This car! This car!

1240
02:10:29,913 --> 02:10:33,333
I'm not saying you'll
regret it, but you might.

1241
02:10:33,333 --> 02:10:38,213
- You should be aware of that.
- We will have to risk regret.

1242
02:10:38,213 --> 02:10:42,634
All right, sure. It's a nice day.
I'll go for a drive with you.

1243
02:11:17,961 --> 02:11:19,838
What about you?

1244
02:11:19,963 --> 02:11:23,550
I violated
the Race and Resettlement Act.

1245
02:11:23,675 --> 02:11:27,846
Though I doubt anyone can point out
the actual provision to me.

1246
02:11:27,971 --> 02:11:31,266
I kissed a Jewish girl.

1247
02:11:34,978 --> 02:11:37,856
Did your prick fall off?

1248
02:11:56,416 --> 02:11:59,586
<i>He likes women.</i>

1249
02:12:00,587 --> 02:12:04,716
He likes good-looking women.

1250
02:12:05,425 --> 02:12:09,721
He sees a beautiful woman,
he doesn't think.

1251
02:12:12,182 --> 02:12:15,310
I mean,
he has so many women.

1252
02:12:15,435 --> 02:12:17,479
And they love him.

1253
02:12:17,604 --> 02:12:20,607
Yeah, they love him.
I mean, he is married, yeah, but he's...

1254
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:25,779
All right, no. She was Jewish.
He shouldn't have done it.

1255
02:12:25,904 --> 02:12:29,616
But you didn't see this girl.

1256
02:12:29,741 --> 02:12:33,078
I saw this girl.
This girl was, woof...

1257
02:12:33,203 --> 02:12:35,455
...she was very good-looking.

1258
02:12:39,501 --> 02:12:41,920
They cast a spell on you,
you know, the Jews.

1259
02:12:42,045 --> 02:12:44,339
When you work closely with them,
like I do, you see this.

1260
02:12:44,506 --> 02:12:48,385
They have this power. It's like a virus.
Some of my men are infected with this virus.

1261
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:50,762
They should be pitied, not punished.
They should receive treatment.

1262
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:53,765
This is as real as typhus.
I see this all the time.

1263
02:12:53,932 --> 02:12:57,352
It's a matter of money?

1264
02:12:57,519 --> 02:13:00,105
You're offering me a bribe?

1265
02:13:01,648 --> 02:13:07,237
A bribe? No. No, please.
It's a gratuity.

1266
02:13:07,362 --> 02:13:08,655
Heil Hitler!

1267
02:13:13,076 --> 02:13:15,370
Hello, Amon!

1268
02:13:18,832 --> 02:13:20,542
Sit down!

1269
02:13:22,836 --> 02:13:26,423
We give you Jewish girls
at five marks a day, Oskar.

1270
02:13:26,548 --> 02:13:28,842
You should kiss us, not them.

1271
02:13:28,842 --> 02:13:32,721
God forbid you ever get
a real taste for Jewish skirt.

1272
02:13:32,846 --> 02:13:36,266
There's no future in it.
They don't have a future.

1273
02:13:36,850 --> 02:13:41,146
That's not just good,
old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.

1274
02:13:41,271 --> 02:13:44,107
It's policy now.

1275
02:13:44,858 --> 02:13:48,862
<i>Yeah, beautiful, good!</i>

1276
02:13:54,576 --> 02:13:58,747
-Again, yes!
-Good!

1277
02:14:29,862 --> 02:14:31,071
<i>Come on faster!</i>

1278
02:14:31,196 --> 02:14:35,075
<i>Be quick!</i>

1279
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:37,494
<i>Move your ass!</i>

1280
02:14:39,454 --> 02:14:40,789
It could be done quicker!

1281
02:14:40,914 --> 02:14:43,208
<i>Hurry up, don't sleep!</i>

1282
02:14:43,333 --> 02:14:47,462
<i>Only the whole pieces,
leave the small parts!</i>

1283
02:14:53,302 --> 02:14:54,887
What's going on here?

1284
02:14:54,928 --> 02:14:57,222
You can do it with your hands,
quick!

1285
02:14:58,056 --> 02:14:59,224
Come here!

1286
02:14:59,349 --> 02:15:01,768
Only the whole pieces,
leave the fucking small parts!

1287
02:15:11,904 --> 02:15:15,824
<i>Now you better make it quick,
get rid of this shit!</i>

1288
02:15:24,374 --> 02:15:28,837
That's it! Immortals!
Immortals are all around!

1289
02:15:33,550 --> 02:15:35,427
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

1290
02:15:35,552 --> 02:15:38,722
As if I don't have enough to do,
they come up with this?

1291
02:15:38,847 --> 02:15:43,268
I have to find every rag
buried up here and burn it.

1292
02:15:44,436 --> 02:15:47,523
The party's over, Oskar. They're closing
us down, sending everybody to Auschwitz.

1293
02:15:47,523 --> 02:15:48,982
-When?
-I don't know.

1294
02:15:49,024 --> 02:15:50,275
As soon as
I can arrange the shipments.

1295
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:54,571
Maybe 30, 40 days.
That ought to be fun.

1296
02:16:15,050 --> 02:16:17,761
- I've been talking to Goeth.
- I know the destination.

1297
02:16:17,886 --> 02:16:20,556
These are the evacuation orders.

1298
02:16:20,597 --> 02:16:23,600
I'm to help organize the shipments,
put myself on the last train.

1299
02:16:23,725 --> 02:16:26,854
That's not what
I was going to say.

1300
02:16:26,895 --> 02:16:30,649
I made Goeth promise me
he'll put in a good word for you.

1301
02:16:30,732 --> 02:16:34,152
Nothing bad is going to happen to you
there. You'll receive special treatment.

1302
02:16:34,194 --> 02:16:38,198
The directives coming in from Berlin
mention "Special Treatment" more and more often.

1303
02:16:38,282 --> 02:16:42,619
- I'd like to think that's not what you mean.
- Preferential treatment, alright?

1304
02:16:42,744 --> 02:16:47,666
- Should we invent a whole new language?
- I think so.

1305
02:16:49,918 --> 02:16:52,588
You're staying, I take it.

1306
02:16:55,757 --> 02:17:01,221
- In Krakow? What on earth for?
- What for? You have a business to run.

1307
02:17:01,763 --> 02:17:03,932
Of course, you'll have
to hire new workers. Poles, I guess.

1308
02:17:03,974 --> 02:17:07,644
They cost a little more, but...

1309
02:17:09,354 --> 02:17:12,191
What are you going to do?

1310
02:17:14,943 --> 02:17:18,071
You ran my business.

1311
02:17:20,824 --> 02:17:23,076
No, I'm going home.

1312
02:17:23,076 --> 02:17:29,333
I've done what I came here for. I've got
more money than any man can spend in a lifetime.

1313
02:17:39,092 --> 02:17:45,140
Some day, this is all
going to end, you know.

1314
02:17:48,268 --> 02:17:51,688
I was going to say
we'll have a drink then.

1315
02:17:55,275 --> 02:17:58,862
I think I better have it now.

1316
02:19:34,082 --> 02:19:38,295
I don't understand.
I mean, you want these people?

1317
02:19:38,378 --> 02:19:40,964
"These people"?
My people, I want my people.

1318
02:19:41,089 --> 02:19:44,092
Who are you, Moses?
Come on, what is this?

1319
02:19:44,134 --> 02:19:45,677
Where's the money in this?
Where's the scam?

1320
02:19:45,677 --> 02:19:47,012
It's good business.

1321
02:19:47,095 --> 02:19:48,847
It's good business
in your opinion.

1322
02:19:48,972 --> 02:19:53,685
Look, you've got to move them,
the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia.

1323
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:56,980
Pay for all that and build another camp.
Doesn't make any sense.

1324
02:19:57,105 --> 02:20:00,317
- Look, Amon, it's good for me...
- You're not telling me something.

1325
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:03,237
I know them. I'm familiar with them.
I don't have to train them.

1326
02:20:03,278 --> 02:20:05,405
- You're not telling me something.
- It's good for you. I'll compensate you.

1327
02:20:05,447 --> 02:20:07,991
- That's right.
- It's good for the army.

1328
02:20:08,116 --> 02:20:10,661
- You know what I'm going to make?
- What?

1329
02:20:10,702 --> 02:20:13,121
- Artillery shells.
- Everyone is making artillery shells.

1330
02:20:13,121 --> 02:20:14,998
- Tank shells, they need that.
- Tanks shells, yeah!

1331
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:17,584
- Everybody's happy.
- Everyone's happy, except me.

1332
02:20:17,709 --> 02:20:20,712
You're probably
scamming me somehow.

1333
02:20:20,754 --> 02:20:23,757
If I'm making a hundred,
you've got to be making three.

1334
02:20:23,882 --> 02:20:27,261
And if you admit to making three,
then it's four actually. But how?

1335
02:20:27,302 --> 02:20:31,056
- I just told you.
- You did, but you didn't.

1336
02:20:33,183 --> 02:20:35,352
Yeah, all right, don't tell me.

1337
02:20:35,435 --> 02:20:39,731
I'll go along with it.
It's just irritating I can't work it out.

1338
02:20:39,773 --> 02:20:44,570
Look, all you have to do
is tell me what it's worth to you.

1339
02:20:44,611 --> 02:20:47,322
- What's a person worth to you?
- No, no, no, no.

1340
02:20:47,364 --> 02:20:50,909
What's one worth to you?

1341
02:20:58,292 --> 02:21:02,754
Poldek Pfefferberg,
Mila Pfefferberg...

1342
02:21:02,796 --> 02:21:05,340
...and uh...

1343
02:21:06,216 --> 02:21:07,801
...uh, Stagel, Stagel...

1344
02:21:07,926 --> 02:21:09,469
- Paul.
- Paul! Paul Stagel.

1345
02:21:09,928 --> 02:21:12,181
Doctor...

1346
02:21:13,348 --> 02:21:17,186
- The investors. I want all of them.
- Yes, sir.

1347
02:21:17,227 --> 02:21:20,105
Uh, Fischer. Ismail Fischer.

1348
02:21:20,189 --> 02:21:23,233
Fischer, Ismail.

1349
02:21:23,358 --> 02:21:26,945
- Josef Scharf.
- One moment, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

1350
02:21:26,987 --> 02:21:29,531
Come on, Stern.
Scharf, Scharf.

1351
02:21:32,075 --> 02:21:36,121
The children,
all the children!

1352
02:21:39,917 --> 02:21:42,002
- Herbert Stier.
- Thank you.

1353
02:21:42,085 --> 02:21:46,673
- How many?
- 400, 450.

1354
02:21:48,675 --> 02:21:51,428
More, more!

1355
02:21:56,850 --> 02:21:58,644
Good morning.

1356
02:22:14,660 --> 02:22:19,998
- Feigenbaum, Jakob.
- Wolf. Wolf Wein.

1357
02:22:24,253 --> 02:22:29,049
Feigenbaum: Lutek, Jakob, Nacha.
Yes? Nacha.

1358
02:22:29,174 --> 02:22:31,009
Nacha, that's right.

1359
02:22:31,176 --> 02:22:33,011
And Wolf.

1360
02:22:33,053 --> 02:22:35,472
How many?

1361
02:22:37,057 --> 02:22:40,727
- 600.
- More!

1362
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:43,272
You can do
the same thing I'm doing.

1363
02:22:43,313 --> 02:22:46,024
- You might even make money at it.
- I don't know.

1364
02:22:46,149 --> 02:22:49,361
Come on, Julius, I know about
the extra food and clothes you give them.

1365
02:22:49,444 --> 02:22:52,072
Paid for out of your own pocket.
If we make a combined approach...

1366
02:22:52,197 --> 02:22:54,449
...we could get more than
4,000 out, mine and yours.

1367
02:22:54,449 --> 02:22:55,617
-Oskar!
-We could relocate them...

1368
02:22:55,617 --> 02:22:59,162
...in something like safety,
in Moravia.

1369
02:22:59,496 --> 02:23:01,331
I don't know.

1370
02:23:03,208 --> 02:23:05,961
How many cigarettes
have you smoked tonight?

1371
02:23:05,961 --> 02:23:06,920
Too many!

1372
02:23:07,045 --> 02:23:11,800
For every one you smoke,
I smoke half.

1373
02:23:12,217 --> 02:23:14,178
- I've done all I can.
- I will not accept that.

1374
02:23:14,219 --> 02:23:17,514
- No, Oskar, I can't do any more.
- I will not accept that.

1375
02:23:17,639 --> 02:23:19,308
No!

1376
02:23:29,318 --> 02:23:32,070
- How many? How many?
- 850, give or take.

1377
02:23:32,112 --> 02:23:36,992
Give or take what, Stern?
Count them. How many?

1378
02:23:46,627 --> 02:23:50,839
That's it.
You can finish that page.

1379
02:23:54,968 --> 02:23:58,847
What... did... Goeth...
say about this?

1380
02:23:58,972 --> 02:24:03,644
You just told him how
many people you needed and...

1381
02:24:05,938 --> 02:24:08,649
You're not buying them?

1382
02:24:10,567 --> 02:24:13,695
You're buying them? You're
paying him for each of these names?

1383
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:17,282
If you were still working for me,
I'd expect you to talk me out of it.

1384
02:24:17,324 --> 02:24:20,661
It's costing me a fortune.

1385
02:24:21,119 --> 02:24:25,123
Finish the page and leave
one space at the bottom.

1386
02:24:46,895 --> 02:24:49,147
You...

1387
02:24:54,736 --> 02:24:58,907
The list is an absolute good.

1388
02:24:58,991 --> 02:25:02,327
The list... is life.

1389
02:25:03,370 --> 02:25:08,792
All around its margins
lies the gulf.

1390
02:25:08,917 --> 02:25:12,796
Oskar, there's a clerical error here
at the bottom of the last page.

1391
02:25:12,921 --> 02:25:15,632
No, there's one more name
I want to put there.

1392
02:25:15,757 --> 02:25:20,220
I'll never find a maid as well trained as her
at Brinnlitz. They are all country girls.

1393
02:25:21,763 --> 02:25:23,182
No!

1394
02:25:32,191 --> 02:25:33,901
No!

1395
02:25:33,942 --> 02:25:36,111
- One hand of twenty-one.
- No!

1396
02:25:36,236 --> 02:25:39,072
- If you win, I pay you 7,400 reichsmarks.
- No!

1397
02:25:39,198 --> 02:25:42,951
- Hit a natural, I make it 14,800.
- No!

1398
02:25:43,076 --> 02:25:46,246
If I win,
the girl goes on my list.

1399
02:25:46,371 --> 02:25:49,625
- I can't wager Helen in a card game.
- Why not?

1400
02:25:49,666 --> 02:25:50,709
Wouldn't be right.

1401
02:25:50,792 --> 02:25:52,544
She's just going to
Auschwitz Number Two, anyway.

1402
02:25:52,544 --> 02:25:54,838
- What difference does it make?
- She's not going to Auschwitz.

1403
02:25:54,838 --> 02:25:59,259
I'd never do that to her. No, I want her
to come back to Vienna with me.

1404
02:25:59,384 --> 02:26:02,387
I want her to come
to work for me there.

1405
02:26:02,513 --> 02:26:06,975
- I want to grow old with her.
- Are you mad?

1406
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:13,398
- Amon, you can't take her to Vienna with you.
- No, of course I can't.

1407
02:26:13,815 --> 02:26:16,401
That's what I'd like to do.

1408
02:26:16,443 --> 02:26:22,407
What I can do, if I'm any sort of a man,
is the next most merciful thing.

1409
02:26:22,533 --> 02:26:27,538
I shall take her into the woods and shoot
her painlessly in the back of the head.

1410
02:26:36,630 --> 02:26:41,051
What was it you said
for a natural 21?

1411
02:26:41,301 --> 02:26:43,595
Was it 14,800?

1412
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:47,182
<i>Jews of Schindler, to these tables!
Say your names clearly.</i>

1413
02:26:47,182 --> 02:26:50,602
- We are the family Dresner.
-Juda, Jonas...

1414
02:26:50,644 --> 02:26:53,021
...Donata and Chaja.

1415
02:26:53,146 --> 02:26:56,733
- We are Rosners. Henry, Manci...
- And Leo.

1416
02:26:56,859 --> 02:27:00,195
- And our son.
- I am Olek.

1417
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:01,780
Maria Mischel.

1418
02:27:01,905 --> 02:27:04,741
Chaim Nowak.

1419
02:27:04,867 --> 02:27:07,202
Wulkan, Markus.

1420
02:27:07,327 --> 02:27:09,621
Michael Lemper.

1421
02:27:10,497 --> 02:27:12,666
Itzhak Stern.

1422
02:27:12,958 --> 02:27:16,044
Rebeka and Joseph Bau.

1423
02:27:16,587 --> 02:27:18,881
- Rosalia Nussbaum.
- Wilhelm Nussbaum.

1424
02:27:19,339 --> 02:27:21,758
Jakob Levartov.

1425
02:27:22,342 --> 02:27:25,053
- Farber, Rosa.
- Farber, Andrzej.

1426
02:27:25,220 --> 02:27:27,931
- Sara.
- Friehof, Fischel.

1427
02:27:29,308 --> 02:27:31,226
Mietek Pemper.

1428
02:27:31,226 --> 02:27:33,770
Poldek and Mila Pfefferberg.

1429
02:27:33,812 --> 02:27:36,356
Horowitz, Dolek.

1430
02:27:37,524 --> 02:27:39,526
Adam Levy.

1431
02:27:39,610 --> 02:27:41,820
Marcel Goldberg.

1432
02:27:41,945 --> 02:27:45,365
Klipstein, Isak David.

1433
02:27:45,490 --> 02:27:47,367
Altmann, Eduard.

1434
02:27:47,492 --> 02:27:49,536
Grunberg, Miriam.

1435
02:27:49,661 --> 02:27:51,705
Luftig, Eliasz.

1436
02:27:51,788 --> 02:27:53,832
Hilmann, Eduard.

1437
02:27:53,957 --> 02:27:56,251
Erna Rothberg.

1438
02:27:56,376 --> 02:27:59,379
Zuckermann, Jetti.

1439
02:27:59,671 --> 02:28:02,382
Helen Hirsch.

1440
02:28:03,425 --> 02:28:06,553
The worst is over.

1441
02:28:07,095 --> 02:28:11,266
<i>Men to this transport
and women to this transport.</i>

1442
02:28:11,266 --> 02:28:16,146
<i>Be careful! Men to this transport
and women to this transport.</i>

1443
02:28:16,271 --> 02:28:20,734
<i>Watch your step! Men to this transport
and women to this transport.</i>

1444
02:28:58,730 --> 02:29:03,318
Wonderful Olek, wonderful.

1445
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:08,156
You know how we make
ice into water?

1446
02:29:08,866 --> 02:29:11,076
Olek, get another one!

1447
02:29:49,406 --> 02:29:52,659
<i>Position yourselves
all in a single row!</i>

1448
02:29:52,784 --> 02:29:57,664
You'll be pleased with the level
of efficiency I get from these workers.

1449
02:29:58,957 --> 02:30:01,126
Budzyn, under my command...

1450
02:30:01,251 --> 02:30:04,129
...was the envy of every other commandant
in the labour camp system.

1451
02:30:04,213 --> 02:30:05,714
- The prisoners, however...
- Excuse me!

1452
02:30:05,797 --> 02:30:08,967
...they would have rather been
somewhere else.

1453
02:30:22,981 --> 02:30:26,276
The train with the women
has already left Plaszow...

1454
02:30:26,401 --> 02:30:30,155
...and will be arriving
here very shortly.

1455
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:32,991
I know you've had
a long journey.

1456
02:30:33,033 --> 02:30:36,286
But it's only a short walk
further to the factory...

1457
02:30:36,411 --> 02:30:41,834
...where hot soup and bread
is waiting for you.

1458
02:30:41,875 --> 02:30:44,461
Welcome to Brinnlitz!

1459
02:30:53,887 --> 02:30:56,974
- Beans in chunt?
- Beans are the best part.

1460
02:30:57,015 --> 02:30:59,309
I don't like beans.

1461
02:30:59,351 --> 02:31:03,272
Beans and meat
and potatoes and bread.

1462
02:31:03,313 --> 02:31:06,191
That's not the way
you make chunt.

1463
02:31:10,028 --> 02:31:13,198
- Eggs in chunt?
- Yes!

1464
02:31:15,450 --> 02:31:18,287
- I don't like chunt.
- No, you don't.

1465
02:31:18,328 --> 02:31:23,458
- What do you like?
- I like caviar!

1466
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:24,918
One day on the fire...

1467
02:31:24,918 --> 02:31:27,045
-Oh, yes!
-One day...

1468
02:32:32,277 --> 02:32:34,154
Position yourselves
in front of the wagons!

1469
02:32:35,697 --> 02:32:39,034
You've got to stay together.

1470
02:32:39,117 --> 02:32:43,413
Leave the wagons!
Leave the wagons!

1471
02:32:44,331 --> 02:32:46,708
I said, leave the wagons!

1472
02:32:48,043 --> 02:32:50,462
<i>Bagaze zostawic!</i>

1473
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:54,883
<i>Faster! Quick! Quick!</i>

1474
02:32:55,008 --> 02:32:57,261
<i>What's going on back there?</i>

1475
02:32:59,847 --> 02:33:01,723
Move it!

1476
02:33:06,562 --> 02:33:10,440
Come on, out!
Hurry up, out!

1477
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:16,738
Thirty, thirty-five,
forty, forty-five...

1478
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:18,740
<i>Out!</i>

1479
02:33:18,782 --> 02:33:21,201
<i>Get out!</i>

1480
02:33:21,326 --> 02:33:24,204
<i>Quicker, get out!</i>

1481
02:33:27,916 --> 02:33:30,627
<i>All of you, out!</i>

1482
02:33:31,503 --> 02:33:35,215
- Where are the list makers?
- Where are the tables?

1483
02:33:38,218 --> 02:33:39,803
<i>Move the line!</i>

1484
02:33:40,345 --> 02:33:42,347
<i>Get out!</i>

1485
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:50,480
<i>- Quick! Get out!
- Faster!</i>

1486
02:33:53,066 --> 02:33:55,068
<i>Quicker!</i>

1487
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:57,529
<i>Come on, be quick!</i>

1488
02:33:57,529 --> 02:34:01,074
Mama, where are we?

1489
02:34:01,658 --> 02:34:04,828
- 17, 18, 20-
- They're in Auschwitz.

1490
02:34:04,953 --> 02:34:08,916
The train was never routed here.
A paperwork mistake.

1491
02:34:17,257 --> 02:34:19,676
<i>Take off your shoes!</i>

1492
02:34:32,564 --> 02:34:35,526
<i>Quicker, quicker!</i>

1493
02:34:38,862 --> 02:34:40,405
<i>Take off your clothes!
Hurry up!</i>

1494
02:34:40,531 --> 02:34:43,158
<i>Hurry up! Stay in a row
and take off your clothes!</i>

1495
02:34:44,701 --> 02:34:46,411
<i>Quicker!</i>

1496
02:35:01,176 --> 02:35:04,179
<i>Quicker!</i>

1497
02:35:04,263 --> 02:35:07,474
<i>Take off your clothes quickly!
Hurry up!</i>

1498
02:35:11,270 --> 02:35:13,313
SHOWERS AND DISINFECTION

1499
02:35:14,648 --> 02:35:16,608
<i>Go in, hurry up!</i>

1500
02:35:19,611 --> 02:35:21,071
Quicker!

1501
02:35:21,196 --> 02:35:23,991
<i>Go to the showers, quickly!</i>

1502
02:35:26,034 --> 02:35:30,289
<i>Quicker! Quicker!</i>

1503
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:02,357
Eyes on the necks!

1504
02:38:05,068 --> 02:38:07,821
Hands on the shoulders!

1505
02:38:07,905 --> 02:38:11,074
<i>- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-eight.</i>

1506
02:38:11,116 --> 02:38:16,663
- Cough for me, mother.
- They say to fall against the fence is a kindness.

1507
02:38:16,955 --> 02:38:19,416
Don't kill yourself
against the fence, Clara.

1508
02:38:19,541 --> 02:38:23,378
If you do, you'll never
know what happened to you.

1509
02:38:25,255 --> 02:38:27,799
- How old are you, mother?
- Sixty-six, sir.

1510
02:38:27,841 --> 02:38:30,093
- Sir?
- Good morning.

1511
02:38:30,135 --> 02:38:33,096
A mistake has been made.
We are not supposed to be here.

1512
02:38:33,222 --> 02:38:36,975
We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews.

1513
02:38:37,017 --> 02:38:40,521
- Who is Oskar Schindler?
- He had a factory in Krakow.

1514
02:38:40,562 --> 02:38:44,983
- Enamelware.
- A pot maker.

1515
02:38:45,442 --> 02:38:47,653
How old are you, mother?

1516
02:38:51,865 --> 02:38:57,704
You are not the only industrialist
who needs labour...

1517
02:38:57,871 --> 02:39:00,123
...Mr. Schindler.

1518
02:39:00,249 --> 02:39:03,126
I remember earlier this year,
IG-Color ordered...

1519
02:39:03,168 --> 02:39:09,007
...a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory.

1520
02:39:09,049 --> 02:39:13,011
The train came in
through the archway...

1521
02:39:13,053 --> 02:39:18,725
...and the officer in charge
of the selection went immediately to work...

1522
02:39:18,767 --> 02:39:21,478
...and sent 2,000 of them...

1523
02:39:21,562 --> 02:39:25,148
...straight away
to "special treatment".

1524
02:39:25,858 --> 02:39:31,446
It is not my task to interfere with
the processes that take place down here.

1525
02:39:32,614 --> 02:39:37,661
Why do you think I can help you
if I can't help IG-Color?

1526
02:39:37,744 --> 02:39:41,039
Allow me to express the reason.

1527
02:39:49,506 --> 02:39:53,051
I'm not making
any judgement about you.

1528
02:39:53,051 --> 02:39:55,637
It's just that I know
that in the coming months...

1529
02:39:55,637 --> 02:39:59,474
...we're all going
to need portable wealth.

1530
02:40:02,060 --> 02:40:04,771
I could have you arrested.

1531
02:40:04,938 --> 02:40:10,194
I'm protected by powerful friends.
You should know that.

1532
02:40:12,529 --> 02:40:16,491
I do not say
I am accepting them.

1533
02:40:16,533 --> 02:40:21,830
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.

1534
02:40:35,385 --> 02:40:38,639
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.

1535
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:41,099
I'll cut you 300 units from it.

1536
02:40:41,141 --> 02:40:45,103
New ones.
These are fresh.

1537
02:40:48,857 --> 02:40:52,861
- The train comes, we turn it around.
- Yes, yes, yes!

1538
02:40:52,986 --> 02:40:54,446
- It's yours.
- I understand.

1539
02:40:54,863 --> 02:40:57,658
I want these.

1540
02:41:00,118 --> 02:41:03,872
You shouldn't
get stuck on names.

1541
02:41:10,587 --> 02:41:14,842
That's right.
It creates a lot of paperwork.

1542
02:41:14,883 --> 02:41:18,887
Zoldinger, Ernestina!
Waldergrun, Hilda!

1543
02:41:19,012 --> 02:41:21,181
Waldergrun, Leonora!

1544
02:41:21,306 --> 02:41:24,643
Laast, Anna!
Pfefferberg, Mila!

1545
02:41:24,726 --> 02:41:28,313
Dresner, Ruth!
Dresner, Danka!

1546
02:41:28,355 --> 02:41:32,067
Nussbaum, Sidonia!
Rosner, Manci!

1547
02:41:32,192 --> 02:41:38,198
Hirsch, Helen! Grosz, Chaja Sara!
Seelenfreund, Estella!

1548
02:41:53,046 --> 02:41:55,215
<i>Move it!
Move it, quick!</i>

1549
02:41:55,299 --> 02:41:59,803
<i>- Faster! Faster!
-Come on!</i>

1550
02:42:01,513 --> 02:42:04,349
<i>Quick, quick!
Faster!</i>

1551
02:42:06,226 --> 02:42:10,355
<i>- Faster!
-Hurry up!</i>

1552
02:42:18,655 --> 02:42:21,700
No! No! No!

1553
02:42:36,089 --> 02:42:39,843
No! No! No!

1554
02:42:43,514 --> 02:42:45,807
No! No! No!

1555
02:42:47,851 --> 02:42:51,855
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

1556
02:42:51,939 --> 02:42:56,735
These are mine! These are my workers!
They should be on my train!

1557
02:42:56,860 --> 02:42:59,446
They're skilled munitions workers!
They're essential!

1558
02:43:00,155 --> 02:43:02,741
Essential girls!

1559
02:43:04,952 --> 02:43:09,289
Their fingers polish the insides
of shell metal casings.

1560
02:43:09,414 --> 02:43:12,835
How else am I to polish the inside of
a 45 millimetre shell casing?

1561
02:43:12,876 --> 02:43:16,713
You tell me.
You tell me!

1562
02:43:18,173 --> 02:43:22,302
Back on the train!
Back on the train!

1563
02:45:16,583 --> 02:45:20,879
Under Department "W" provisions...

1564
02:45:20,963 --> 02:45:25,300
...it is unlawful
to kill a worker without just cause.

1565
02:45:25,425 --> 02:45:28,428
Under the Businesses
Compensation Fund...

1566
02:45:28,470 --> 02:45:32,766
...I am entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths.

1567
02:45:32,891 --> 02:45:35,853
If you shoot without thinking...

1568
02:45:35,894 --> 02:45:40,190
...you go to prison, I get paid.

1569
02:45:40,315 --> 02:45:42,609
That's how it works.

1570
02:45:42,651 --> 02:45:47,865
So, there will be no
summary executions here.

1571
02:45:48,615 --> 02:45:53,370
There will be no interference
of any kind with production.

1572
02:45:53,453 --> 02:45:58,625
In hopes of ensuring that, guards will
no longer be allowed on the factory floor...

1573
02:45:58,750 --> 02:46:02,337
...without my authorization.

1574
02:46:07,176 --> 02:46:11,930
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

1575
02:46:12,514 --> 02:46:14,683
Come on, come!

1576
02:46:15,350 --> 02:46:17,352
<i>Oh, boy! I haven't seen
something like that since years.</i>

1577
02:46:17,519 --> 02:46:20,355
Come on, boys, come!

1578
02:46:46,006 --> 02:46:51,970
No doorman or maitre d'
will ever mistake you again...

1579
02:46:52,095 --> 02:46:54,389
...I promise.

1580
02:47:01,104 --> 02:47:04,858
- This is Itzhak Stern, my accountant.
- You must be Mrs. Schindler.

1581
02:47:04,858 --> 02:47:07,569
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Emilie has volunteered to work in the clinic.

1582
02:47:07,569 --> 02:47:09,571
- Very generous of you.
- I know.

1583
02:47:09,571 --> 02:47:12,282
We need to talk
when you have a moment.

1584
02:47:12,324 --> 02:47:14,952
This is my wife, Stern.
I don't keep any secrets from my spouse.

1585
02:47:14,993 --> 02:47:17,996
Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.

1586
02:47:18,121 --> 02:47:18,997
- Madam.
- Hello!

1587
02:47:19,039 --> 02:47:19,998
What is it?

1588
02:47:19,998 --> 02:47:22,835
We've received an angry complaint
from the Armaments Board.

1589
02:47:22,876 --> 02:47:25,045
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings!

1590
02:47:25,170 --> 02:47:27,840
Apparently all of them
have failed quality control tests.

1591
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:28,882
That's to be expected!

1592
02:47:28,966 --> 02:47:32,177
Start-up problems. This isn't pots
and pans. This is a precise business.

1593
02:47:32,261 --> 02:47:34,179
- I'll write them a letter.
- They're withholding payment.

1594
02:47:34,263 --> 02:47:38,433
Sure, so would I, so would you. I wouldn't
worry. We'll get it right one of these days.

1595
02:47:38,433 --> 02:47:42,896
There's a rumour you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.

1596
02:47:42,980 --> 02:47:47,734
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.

1597
02:47:48,861 --> 02:47:51,196
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.

1598
02:47:51,321 --> 02:47:53,448
- Pass them off as ours.
- I don't see the difference...

1599
02:47:53,448 --> 02:47:54,449
...whether they're made here
or somewhere else.

1600
02:47:54,491 --> 02:47:55,909
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.

1601
02:47:55,993 --> 02:47:57,327
You'll lose a lot of money.

1602
02:47:57,369 --> 02:48:00,664
Fewer shells will be made.
Stern, if this factory ever produces...

1603
02:48:00,747 --> 02:48:06,170
...a shell that can actually be fired,
I'll be very unhappy.

1604
02:48:06,211 --> 02:48:09,298
- Hello, madam.
- How do you do?

1605
02:48:22,686 --> 02:48:27,232
How are you doing, Rabbi?
Rabbi!

1606
02:48:29,401 --> 02:48:32,196
Good, Mr. Director.

1607
02:48:33,363 --> 02:48:35,616
Sun's going down.

1608
02:48:37,826 --> 02:48:39,953
Yes, it is.

1609
02:48:41,205 --> 02:48:45,250
What day is this? Friday?
It is Friday, isn't it?

1610
02:48:45,375 --> 02:48:47,377
Is it?

1611
02:48:50,797 --> 02:48:55,802
What's the matter with you?
You should be preparing for the Sabbath.

1612
02:48:55,844 --> 02:48:58,680
Shouldn't you?

1613
02:49:04,728 --> 02:49:09,858
I've got some wine.
In my office. Come!

1614
02:50:24,516 --> 02:50:27,603
<i>What?</i>

1615
02:50:27,644 --> 02:50:32,608
Do you have any money,
uh, hidden away someplace...

1616
02:50:32,649 --> 02:50:35,819
...that I don't know about?

1617
02:50:38,780 --> 02:50:41,325
No!

1618
02:50:45,662 --> 02:50:49,666
Why?
Am I broke?

1619
02:50:52,669 --> 02:50:54,796
Well...

1620
02:50:55,672 --> 02:51:02,095
<i>Yesterday morning, at 2:41 a. m...</i>

1621
02:51:02,137 --> 02:51:06,099
<i>...at General Eisenhower's
headquarters...</i>

1622
02:51:06,225 --> 02:51:08,936
<i>...General Jodl...</i>

1623
02:51:08,977 --> 02:51:13,106
<i>...signed the Act
of Unconditional Surrender...</i>

1624
02:51:13,148 --> 02:51:19,238
<i>...of all German land,
sea and air forces in Europe...</i>

1625
02:51:19,279 --> 02:51:23,408
<i>...to the Allied
Expeditionary Force.</i>

1626
02:51:23,408 --> 02:51:27,579
<i>And simultaneously
to the Soviet High Command.</i>

1627
02:51:28,288 --> 02:51:32,125
<i>The German war is,
therefore, at an end.</i>

1628
02:51:32,167 --> 02:51:34,169
<i>But let us not forget for a moment...</i>

1629
02:51:34,253 --> 02:51:38,549
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.

1630
02:51:38,590 --> 02:51:41,760
<i>...Japan, with all
her treachery and greed...</i>

1631
02:51:41,885 --> 02:51:47,349
The unconditional surrender
of Germany has just been announced.

1632
02:51:47,432 --> 02:51:52,062
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.

1633
02:51:54,022 --> 02:51:56,358
Tomorrow you'll
begin the process...

1634
02:51:56,441 --> 02:52:00,195
...of looking for survivors
of your families.

1635
02:52:02,614 --> 02:52:08,078
In most cases,
you won't find them.

1636
02:52:09,329 --> 02:52:12,082
After six long years
of murder...

1637
02:52:12,207 --> 02:52:17,588
...victims are being mourned
throughout the world.

1638
02:52:17,629 --> 02:52:20,757
We've survived.

1639
02:52:20,799 --> 02:52:25,053
Many of you have come up
to me and thanked me.

1640
02:52:27,055 --> 02:52:29,224
Thank yourselves.

1641
02:52:30,350 --> 02:52:33,770
Thank your fearless Stern...

1642
02:52:33,770 --> 02:52:36,190
...and others among you
who worried about you...

1643
02:52:36,231 --> 02:52:40,235
...and faced death
at every moment.

1644
02:52:43,238 --> 02:52:45,824
I'm a member of the Nazi party.

1645
02:52:45,949 --> 02:52:49,244
I'm a munitions manufacturer.

1646
02:52:49,369 --> 02:52:51,705
I'm a profiteer of slave labour.

1647
02:52:51,788 --> 02:52:55,542
I am a criminal.

1648
02:52:55,626 --> 02:53:00,672
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.

1649
02:53:01,256 --> 02:53:04,718
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight...

1650
02:53:04,843 --> 02:53:11,099
...after which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me I have to flee.

1651
02:53:13,268 --> 02:53:16,980
I know you have received orders
from our commandant...

1652
02:53:17,022 --> 02:53:22,110
...which he has received from his superiors
to dispose of the population of this camp.

1653
02:53:22,236 --> 02:53:24,571
Now would be
the time to do it.

1654
02:53:24,696 --> 02:53:30,702
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.

1655
02:53:34,748 --> 02:53:38,460
Or you could leave...

1656
02:53:38,585 --> 02:53:40,879
...and return
to your families as men...

1657
02:53:41,004 --> 02:53:44,883
...instead of murderers.

1658
02:54:25,048 --> 02:54:29,219
In memory of the countless
victims among your people...

1659
02:54:29,344 --> 02:54:33,515
...I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.

1660
02:55:28,153 --> 02:55:33,408
- Thank you, Mr. Jereth.
- Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1661
02:55:33,450 --> 02:55:35,869
Open wide.

1662
02:55:37,538 --> 02:55:39,581
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

1663
02:55:58,183 --> 02:56:00,435
Thank you, Mr. Jereth!

1664
02:56:24,501 --> 02:56:28,755
As soon as peace occurs,
I want...

1665
02:56:28,922 --> 02:56:33,051
...um, I want that cloth
distributed to the workers.

1666
02:56:33,051 --> 02:56:35,637
Two and a half metres each.

1667
02:56:35,762 --> 02:56:38,932
Also, each person is
to get a bottle of vodka.

1668
02:56:38,974 --> 02:56:42,060
They won't drink it.
They know its value.

1669
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:45,606
Likewise those Egipshi cigarettes
we organized.

1670
02:56:45,647 --> 02:56:49,943
It'll be done.
Everything you ask.

1671
02:57:09,004 --> 02:57:13,258
We've written a letter,
trying to explain things...

1672
02:57:13,383 --> 02:57:16,553
...in case you are captured.

1673
02:57:17,846 --> 02:57:21,099
Every worker has signed it.

1674
02:57:31,109 --> 02:57:32,986
Thank you!

1675
02:57:59,888 --> 02:58:02,182
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.

1676
02:58:02,266 --> 02:58:08,313
It says:
"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire. "

1677
02:58:47,227 --> 02:58:50,689
I could have got more out.

1678
02:58:51,940 --> 02:58:54,359
I could have got more.
I don't know.

1679
02:58:54,985 --> 02:58:56,778
If I just...

1680
02:58:57,946 --> 02:58:59,072
I could have got more.

1681
02:58:59,072 --> 02:59:04,620
Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are
alive because of you. Look at them.

1682
02:59:04,953 --> 02:59:07,497
If I'd made more money...

1683
02:59:11,502 --> 02:59:16,298
I threw away so much money.

1684
02:59:18,258 --> 02:59:21,261
You have no idea.

1685
02:59:21,386 --> 02:59:22,387
If I had just...

1686
02:59:22,429 --> 02:59:26,683
There will be generations
because of what you did.

1687
02:59:27,851 --> 02:59:30,270
I didn't do enough.

1688
02:59:30,395 --> 02:59:33,273
You did so much.

1689
02:59:36,693 --> 02:59:39,154
This car...

1690
02:59:39,279 --> 02:59:40,989
...Goeth would've bought this car.

1691
02:59:41,532 --> 02:59:46,286
Why did I keep the car?
Ten people right there.

1692
02:59:48,705 --> 02:59:51,583
Ten people.

1693
02:59:52,292 --> 02:59:55,170
Ten more people.

1694
02:59:57,005 --> 02:59:58,465
This pin...

1695
02:59:58,590 --> 03:00:02,302
...two people.

1696
03:00:03,011 --> 03:00:04,763
This is gold.

1697
03:00:04,888 --> 03:00:06,473
Two more people.

1698
03:00:06,890 --> 03:00:09,726
He would have given me
two for it, at least one.

1699
03:00:09,852 --> 03:00:13,188
He would have given me one,
one more.

1700
03:00:15,649 --> 03:00:18,443
One more person.

1701
03:00:20,070 --> 03:00:25,450
A person, Stern,
for this!

1702
03:00:27,452 --> 03:00:31,331
I could have gotten...

1703
03:00:31,456 --> 03:00:36,211
...one more person and I didn't.

1704
03:00:36,753 --> 03:00:40,215
And I, I didn't!

1705
03:02:08,720 --> 03:02:11,431
You have been liberated...

1706
03:02:11,598 --> 03:02:14,852
...by the Soviet Army!

1707
03:02:22,317 --> 03:02:23,902
Have you been in Poland?

1708
03:02:24,027 --> 03:02:27,489
I just came from Poland.

1709
03:02:28,740 --> 03:02:31,451
Are there any Jews left?

1710
03:02:36,498 --> 03:02:39,042
Where should we go?

1711
03:02:39,168 --> 03:02:41,211
Don't go east, that's for sure.

1712
03:02:41,336 --> 03:02:44,506
They hate you there.

1713
03:02:44,923 --> 03:02:48,760
I wouldn't go west either,
if I were you.

1714
03:02:49,678 --> 03:02:52,806
We could use some food.

1715
03:02:54,516 --> 03:02:58,520
Isn't there a town over there?

1716
03:04:11,426 --> 03:04:54,179
