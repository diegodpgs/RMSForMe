00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:09,165
Hey, Jenny.
That was awonderful share, tonight.

2
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,415
<i>"Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck.</i>

3
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,111
<i>"Enter Ahab. Then, all.</i>

4
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,649
<i>"It was not a great while
after the affair of the pipe,</i>

5
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,386
<i>"that one morning, shortly after breakfast,
Ahab, as was his wont,</i>

6
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,190
<i>"ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.</i>

7
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:59,979
<i>"'It's a white whale, I say, ' resumed Ahab,
as he threw down the top-maul.</i>

8
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:04,045
<i>"'A white whale.
Skin your eyes for him, men,</i>

9
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,649
<i>"'look sharp for white water,
if ye see but a bubble, sing out. "'</i>

10
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,450
Tommy?

11
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,816
Jesus!

12
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,196
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,631
Well, I was just passing through

14
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,569
and I figured why not have a belt
with the old man.

15
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,402
Yeah.

16
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,205
She looks good.

17
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,177
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

18
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,214
Well, you always did take good care of her.

19
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,190
Paddy Conlon.

20
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,886
Man of priorities.

21
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,431
I got a little something foryou.

22
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,602
Mom always said,
"Never go anywhere empty-handed."

23
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,936
She did.

24
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,777
That's not for me anymore, Tommy.

25
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,483
What? You changed brands?

26
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,849
Let's go inside, huh?

27
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,422
Tommy!

28
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,093
Come on, let's go inside.

29
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,977
I like what you've done with the place.

30
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,523
Yeah, I appreciate that.

31
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,627
There's not much of awoman's touch
around here.

32
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,488
Yeah, well...

33
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,233
And no more women for me, Tommy.

34
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,935
Yeah.

35
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,238
It must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

36
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,410
Here you go.

37
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,076
Coffee?

38
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,020
You haven't seen a guy in 14years
and you're not gonna have a drinkwith him?

39
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,219
-Come on.
-I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.

40
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,193
I'm coming up on 1,000 days.

41
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:04,162
-Come on, it's just a drink.
-No.

42
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,799
He's a school teacher down in Philly.

43
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,069
Remember Tess?

44
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,833
They had two beautiful little girls.

45
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,328
So, you found God, huh? That's awesome.

46
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,173
I think Mom kept calling out for him,
but he wasn't around.

47
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:20,640
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all the drunks, huh?

48
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,040
Who knew?

49
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,720
So, you gonna ask about her,

50
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,623
oryou just gonna sit there all sober?

51
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,327
-I know.
-You know? What do you know? Huh?

52
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,634
Do you know it wasn't enough to drive west
to get away from you,

53
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,398
that once we hit the water,
we drove north, too?

54
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,208
When I got sober, I hired a man to find you.

55
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,571
And is that one ofthe 12 steps?

56
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,843
Or does a guy like you get 24?

57
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,148
Just 12.

58
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,225
Did your guytell you
what you needed to know?

59
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,997
Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

60
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,192
But you were in the Marines.

61
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,428
That was all.

62
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,205
That was enough.

63
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,712
Well, that's too bad,

64
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,011
'cause you could've gotten
some good details.

65
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:36,051
You could've heard about her
coughing up blood on her knees

66
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,986
in a shit boxwith no heat.

67
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:45,729
Having me rub her down with holywater,
because, well, she didn't have no insurance.

68
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:51,462
All the time waiting foryour pal,
Jesus, to save her.

69
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,265
Did your man tell you that?

70
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,946
I'm sorry, Tommy.

71
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,222
Well, it's good to know
that you're sorry, Pop.

72
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,318
It goes a long way.

73
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,800
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

74
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,979
All right, then. All right, all right, all right.

75
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,679
You say I can, but you say I can't.

76
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,984
-What about ifwe all get a unicorn?
-No.

77
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,615
-Don't you want a unicorn?
-No.

78
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,260
What's going on up here?

79
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,993
-Oh, my goodness.
-Well, I'm not sure,

80
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,730
but I think Daddy is now a princess.

81
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,602
-Daddy, you look so handsome.
-Do l?

82
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,436
-He's avery pretty princess.
-We're painting Daddy's face.

83
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,610
Yeah, you are.

84
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,611
Okay. Yeah.
Em, you wanna open your presents?

85
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,849
-Yeah? You wanna do present time? Okay.
-Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?

86
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,556
-All right! It's time for presents!
-I have to put this down.

87
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,592
-Here. You wanna put it down?
-Presents time!

88
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,558
-Everybody, come bring your presents!
-What is it? What is it?

89
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,421
Let's start with this one.
How about that, Emily?

90
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,762
-All right.
-Happy birthday, Emily.

91
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,503
-What did you get? What did you get?
-Babe?

92
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,272
It's an awfully big box.

93
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,166
It's her birthday. Come on.

94
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,004
I know, babe,
but that's why you call it a budget.

95
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,670
You set it and you don't budge.

96
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,680
-This one's mine.
-Hey, open the big box!

97
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,213
It's okay.

98
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,849
-I love you. Be good, okay?
-Bye, Mommy.

99
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,186
Daddy's gonna give you a bath.

100
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,691
-Hey, babe. I'm late.
-Hey.

101
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,195
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls,
she's got to get on the road.

102
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,630
-They've been fed, they just need a bath.
-I'm on it.

103
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,065
Okay, can you get them to bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

104
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,398
Because, after the party,
they're just exhausted.

105
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,768
Where's the rest ofthat skirt?

106
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,202
Babe.

107
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,577
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle
in that joint tonight,

108
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,042
you give me a call, okay?

109
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,010
Yeah, just like you gave me a call
when those Temple frat boys

110
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,843
decided to smash up your face.

111
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,110
I told you, most nights,
I sit on the stool and grade papers,

112
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,244
but, every now and then,
I need some action.

113
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:27,250
All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.
I'll see what I can do about that.

114
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,991
Promises, promises.

115
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,558
And we return here on MMA Live,

116
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,003
Jon Anik, alongside the billionaire
fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,

117
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,098
the Tapout crew is here,
Punk and Skrape are in the building.

118
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,101
Now, J.J., what led to this project

119
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,645
that is really redefining
mixed martial arts here in the States?

120
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,210
Well, mixed martial arts is a sport
I've been incredibly passionate about,

121
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,945
and as far as where
the idea for Sparta came from,

122
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,819
I've always really dug the Grand Prix format,
so I tracked these guys down.

123
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,083
And when J.J. came to us,
he said he wanted to create

124
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,716
the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts.

125
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,886
And he decided to put up
the $5 million purse, too.

126
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,933
Well, there you have it, it shall be done.
Hedge fund king, J.J. Riley,

127
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,560
going from the lions' den of Wall Street
to the cage,

128
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:16,335
and promoting the biggest winner-take-all
tournament in MMA history. Sparta...

129
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,431
Doing good. One more time.

130
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,568
Fitzy still own this?

131
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,910
I don't know no Fitzy.
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

132
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,644
Can I help you with something?

133
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,247
How does it work?

134
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,222
Thirty-five a month with locker.

135
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,487
We're open at 7:00, lights out at 11:00.

136
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,996
So you want to join?

137
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,555
Sure.

138
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,364
Put your name and contact info on the card.

139
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,502
Thankyou.

140
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,509
All right. There's a lesson in this, too, okay?

141
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:02,847
Hold on, Tito.

142
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,149
So, we have a body at rest,

143
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,753
and you have the bat which needs...

144
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,690
-Acceleration.
-Acceleration, okay.

145
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,124
Ifyou have enough acceleration,

146
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,754
you might have a chance
of breaking the body at rest.

147
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,489
-Okay. All right. You ready?
-Piece of cake.

148
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,160
Everybody got the glasses on? Okay, go!
Piece of cake!

149
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:18,692
Come on, man!

150
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,531
Come on, son!

151
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,436
All right! All right. There we go.
Well done, Tito. Well done.

152
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,443
Remind me not to mess with you.

153
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,518
Sit down, everybody. Dial it down.

154
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,882
So, have we got it?

155
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,614
Force equals mass times acceleration,
we got it.

156
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,124
All right. Has everybody else got it?

157
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,289
-Yeah.
-Yes? Okay, good. All right.

158
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,152
The third law...

159
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,323
How many laws this dude got?

160
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,232
-The dude?
-Yes, the dude.

161
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,199
The dude has three, all right?

162
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,166
Newton, the dude, says that
for every action,

163
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,135
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

164
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,579
For example,

165
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,844
if K.C. does not stop the action
of sending texts in class

166
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,612
and tell her posse outside to beat it,

167
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,451
then my reaction might be
to send her down to Principal Zito's office.

168
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,856
Thus setting the world back
in proper balance.

169
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,189
Mr. C, I put it away.

170
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:23,659
All right, before you go,
I have yourtests from last week.

171
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,628
Just work it out.

172
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,306
Stop clowning.

173
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,566
Pick up the hands.

174
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,344
Tighten it up!

175
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,413
Use your right.

176
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,018
Seal his hands, come on.

177
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,781
Seal his hands. Keep your hands up!

178
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,818
Go light!

179
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,858
I said, go light!

180
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,959
God damn it!

181
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:56,995
Where do you find these girls?

182
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,999
We got atournament coming up,
you're gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?

183
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,107
Oh, jeez.

184
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,173
Fenroy, get me some ice.

185
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,980
And call that Puerto Rican kid,
the one that fights out ofthe bottoms.

186
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,015
If he's here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

187
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,709
Yo, I'll fight him.

188
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,411
Do me a favor, guy, go backto your bag.

189
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,751
We don't need anybody else getting hurt.
Take awalk.

190
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,223
Let's go. Watch his neck.

191
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,551
Yo, Rock, what did you do,

192
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,322
did you leave Mick and Paulie
at home today?

193
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,802
His phone's disconnected.

194
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,599
Then go through the list.
Find me somebody. Get me Joe Bones.

195
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,138
All I'm saying is
that ifyou need somebodyto help you,

196
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,902
I'm happyto keep your boywarm foryou.

197
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,518
You ever fought before?

198
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,626
Yeah.

199
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,462
Hey, this guy signed awaiver?

200
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,561
All good.

201
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,906
-What's your name?
-Tommy.

202
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,575
-You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tom.
-Sure, no problem. No problem.

203
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,110
Come on in.

204
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,087
Let's go. All right, let's go.

205
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,117
Hey. Watch that teeth.

206
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,357
Are you gonna be a hero? All right.

207
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,629
Come on. Checkthat kick.

208
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,104
Easy.

209
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,833
Come on, Dog, you can do it.
Let's go, come on.

210
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,668
-Good jab. Good jab!
-There we go!

211
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,978
No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.
Don't let him take your back!

212
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,087
-Dog, get up.
-Get up!

213
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,081
Cover up, cover up!

214
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,652
Don't give him your back.
Don't give him your back!

215
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,023
-Cover up!
-Come on, Dog!

216
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:09,959
Cover up, damn it!

217
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,583
You owe me 200 bucks.

218
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,934
This one here.
See, this is the new appraisal figures

219
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,100
-that came in.
-Yeah.

220
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,371
And this is how it affects the monthly,
it turns into that.

221
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,312
And the total value ofthe loan,
overthe life ofthe loan, is that.

222
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,677
As you can see, that's just the way it is.

223
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,375
It puts you upside down,
that's the problem.

224
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,612
It's the countythat did the assessment,
not the bank.

225
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,086
So, the numbers are what they are,
Mr. Conlon...

226
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,214
-Brendan.
-The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

227
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,360
I mean, you're a math teacher, right?
You can appreciate that.

228
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,122
I'm a physics teacher. I teach physics.

229
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:14,754
Physics, okay. But the bank has got to go
by the new appraisal figures.

230
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,495
And, according to these figures,
you're upside down on your mortgage,

231
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,230
-you understand?
-God, you said that like three times.

232
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,303
I'm sorry, but I get that.

233
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,672
I am asking you,
is there something else you can do?

234
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,276
Not the bank, you.
Can you shift things around, restructure?

235
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,847
You refinanced twice already.

236
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,609
'Cause you advised us to do that.

237
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,076
-You told me.
-Well, I presented you with that option,

238
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,448
but that was your choice.

239
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:40,324
I'm also showing that you netted
a substantial payout with the refi.

240
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,727
We had that conversation.

241
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,156
I was paying medical bills.

242
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:50,201
Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's kidney?

243
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,096
-Heart.
-Heart. Right, sorry.

244
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,566
A lot of stories.

245
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,705
All right, so, ifthat's my option,
I have no options.

246
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,076
You're not even gonnatry and help me.
You're not even gonnatry.

247
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,945
No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan,
I can get you 90 days to get even.

248
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,041
Ninety days is not enough.

249
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,821
Mywife and l,
we have three jobs between us.

250
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,526
And that doesn't cut it.

251
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,125
So, what do you suggest?

252
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,827
Well, let me askyou a question?
Have you thought about bankruptcy?

253
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,963
It's aviable option.

254
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,960
There's no shame in this these days.

255
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,439
That's not how I do things.

256
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,646
Okay, well, then
you're looking at foreclosure.

257
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:50,522
Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,
the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.

258
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,156
The prodigy has yet to yield a single point
in the entire tournament.

259
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,427
Tommy, trained by his father
since the age of five.

260
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,368
-Talking about Paddy Conlon?
-The controversial Paddy Conlon.

261
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,063
Say what you will about the methods
of the former Marine,

262
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,870
but he's led his son
to six straight Junior Olympic titles

263
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,707
and nowjust moments away
from a High School State Championship.

264
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,940
And there it is! Wow!

265
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,944
There's just no limit
to what the future holds for this kid.

266
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,645
Tommy told me that he's chasing
the record of Theogenes,

267
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:19,451
apparently, a mythical Greek fighter
said to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.

268
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,621
Hi, how're you doing, sir?
I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.

269
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,326
-Who?
-Tommy Riordan.

270
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,296
My name is Colt Boyd.

271
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,203
What business you got with Tommy?

272
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,432
Well, none yet, that's why I'm here.
I manage fighters.

273
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,438
So, Tommy's been working out at my gym,

274
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,413
and he put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

275
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,852
So, I want to know
a little bit more about the guy.

276
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,821
Maybe help him out.

277
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,358
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

278
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,961
Conlon. The name is Conlon.

279
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,655
And anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

280
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,462
you gotta ask him yourself.

281
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,603
Look, I'm just asking
for some general information here.

282
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,133
Like I said, anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

283
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,764
you gotta ask him yourself.

284
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,533
Look, I don't mean
to interrupt your night, okay?

285
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,941
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

286
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,942
He doesn't live here.

287
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,251
-All right, then.
-Okay. Good night.

288
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,396
All right, listen, kiddo.
I need you to put Mommy back on, okay?

289
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,592
I love you.

290
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,800
Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling in,
I'm gonna have to go.

291
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:44,398
No, they got an open mic night thing on,
it's gonna be a quiet one.

292
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,974
All right, sleep well.

293
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,513
You, too. All right, bye.

294
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,647
It's about time foryournext contest.

295
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:03,053
Introducing first, in the red corner,
he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.

296
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:07,928
Please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore.

297
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,100
Say, "Uncle!"

298
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,698
Go, Mike. Go!

299
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:19,868
And his opponent in the blue corner,
he fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

300
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:24,342
Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon.

301
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,923
This bout is scheduled
for three, five-minute rounds,

302
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,890
and when the action begins,
your referee is Mr. Rick Fike.

303
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,520
Fighters to the center.

304
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,291
Come on, gentlemen.

305
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,426
I want you to obey my commands
at all times.

306
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,663
I want you to protect yourselves at all times.

307
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,070
If you have no questions,
touch gloves, back up.

308
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,642
And on my signal, let's come out fighting.

309
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,614
Fighter, are you ready?

310
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,044
Are you ready?

311
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,277
Do it!

312
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,696
Come on, Mike, let's go!

313
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,341
You gotta move with that one.

314
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:44,562
Come on, Mike!

315
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,099
Don't let him do that to you, Mike!

316
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:02,814
Get up, Mike, get up!

317
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,560
-First five minutes, out.
-Another 15? Great.

318
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,601
Hey! Hey, kid!

319
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,303
Nice fight.
Two more wins, you take home the bacon.

320
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,669
Hey, good job...

321
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,555
Hey, babe.

322
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,883
Hey.

323
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,852
Howwas work?

324
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,919
Oh, my God!

325
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,691
What happened?

326
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,797
You said it was gonna be a slow night.

327
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,736
I'm not bouncing at a club.

328
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,873
What do you mean you're not bouncing?

329
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,063
You've been lying to me?

330
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,898
I went in to apply

331
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,208
and theywere paying nine bucks an hour.

332
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:24,645
Then I saw a sign forthis otherthing.

333
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,697
They're putting us out ofthe house
in three months.

334
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:34,822
We're running out of options.

335
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,560
Then they put us out ofthe house
in three months.

336
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,426
I'd rather go backto the old apartment

337
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,597
than see you in the back
of an ambulance again.

338
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,768
I thought we agreed
that we weren't gonna raise our children

339
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,403
in a familywhere their father
gets beat up for a living.

340
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,942
We're not giving up the house.

341
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,849
It's our home.

342
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,817
We're not going backwards.

343
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,667
We'll figure it out.

344
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,736
This is what we're not going backto.

345
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,503
You wanted to talk?

346
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,397
Yeah.

347
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,944
I'm gonna start fighting.

348
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,836
Is that right?

349
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:29,971
Don't play babe in the woods with me.

350
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,379
I knowthat guy from the gym
came to see you.

351
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,951
Colt Boyd.

352
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,152
Yeah. I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.

353
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,649
I wouldn't be sitting here
with you now ifyou did.

354
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,022
-Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
-No. Thankyou. I'm fine.

355
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:46,128
-Hon, would you like a cup of coffee? Okay.
-Sure. Thankyou.

356
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,262
All right.

357
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,436
There's this tournament,

358
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,104
it's a big tournament.

359
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,468
Top 16 middleweights in the world.
Single elimination.

360
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,340
Winnertakes all. It's a lot of money.

361
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,811
-Okay.
-I'm gonna dothat.

362
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,780
But ifI'm doing it,

363
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,919
then I'm gonna need atrainer.

364
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,753
Now, that much, you were good at.

365
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,293
What?

366
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,400
No, no, no.
This doesn't mean anything, okay?

367
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,560
I'm serious.

368
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,736
We train. That's it.

369
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,365
I don't want to hear aword
about anything but training.

370
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,966
You understand?

371
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,972
You want to tell yourwar stories,
you can take them down to the VFW.

372
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:40,447
Oryou can take it to a meeting, orto church,

373
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,918
orwhateverthe hell it is
that you do nowadays.

374
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,754
What about Colt Boyd?

375
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,324
What about him? I told him
I don't train with people that I don't know.

376
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,825
-The devil you know.
-Excuse me?

377
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,923
The devil you know
is better than the devil you don't.

378
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,600
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

379
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,899
There's your coffee, hon.

380
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:02,833
-Thankyou.
-You're welcome.

381
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,435
Chasing Theogenes.
It'll be kind of like the old times.

382
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,209
I just told you, this doesn't mean anything.

383
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:15,116
Now, get that through your skull right now
or I'm walking.

384
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,017
All right. All right.

385
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,721
But you get something
through your skull, too.

386
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:23,988
You called me, so don't go
threatening to walk every five minutes.

387
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,125
And since this is about training,

388
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,129
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those pills are concerned.

389
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,102
I don't wanna see them.

390
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,340
In fact, hand them over right now.

391
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,242
I knowthey're on you, Tommy.

392
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,074
You sounded like a goddamn maraca
coming through the door.

393
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,757
That's not gonna do.

394
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,491
When you came through that door, it was...

395
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,464
Three.

396
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,574
That'a boy.

397
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,944
And anotherthing.
You don't eat crap like this.

398
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,179
This is for losers and old men.

399
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,983
And we're gonna have to bunk up.

400
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,286
Ifwe're gonna do this right,
you're gonna stay at the house.

401
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,030
I watch your diet.
We followthe old regimen.

402
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,927
You copy?

403
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,537
All right.

404
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,367
Copy.

405
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:57,743
Your brother's a liar.

406
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,346
-...went in the middle ofthe night...
-Yeah.

407
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,925
...and hewent to a strip club,
and he said he saw Mr. C...

408
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,220
-Noway.
-Front and center.

409
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,592
-Like MMAtype stuff.
-You weren't there, so you don't know.

410
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,664
What's MMA?

411
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:07,731
-Mixed martial arts.
-Like, fighting.

412
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,197
Like, different styles of fighting.

413
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,564
He was just, like,
dropped him on the floor...

414
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:17,964
It's true?

415
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,976
Take your seats.

416
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,375
Now, please.

417
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,654
Hey, yo, Mr. C.

418
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,161
Hey, my brotherwas at the titty bar
last night,

419
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,754
and he said you was choking brothers out.
I mean, what's up, is it true?

420
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,956
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, like, is it true?

421
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,864
Did you reallywork on some fools
or something?

422
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,869
-You have to tell us.
-Yeah.

423
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,215
All right.
I want examples of forms of energy.

424
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,404
Come on. It's not as bad as it looks.

425
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:28,602
Are you being literal or figurative?
Because, literally, it looks bad.

426
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,114
And figuratively, it looks even worse.

427
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,410
The superintendent's coming by.
Few minutes.

428
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,389
Oh, man.

429
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,682
So, come on, Brendan.
Give me a little help here.

430
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,158
I mean, could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

431
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,534
I need the money, Joe.

432
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,268
Yeah, but this is...

433
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,067
We can't have this.

434
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,474
This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's,
for Christ's sake.

435
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,472
Shit, Brendan.

436
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,448
Leaving everything else aside,
which we can't,

437
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,381
are you out ofyour mind?

438
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,646
You're gonna get yourself killed.

439
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,313
I mean, you're a goddamn teacher.

440
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,857
You got no business in the ring
with those animals.

441
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,456
Actually, I used to be one ofthose animals.

442
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,501
I fought for a living.

443
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,105
Guess I forgot to put that down
on my application.

444
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,866
Yeah, I guess you did.

445
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,375
Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just...

446
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,278
Look, look,
the school district is not gonnatolerate

447
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,442
teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

448
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,178
It was a parking lot of a strip club.

449
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,619
Wherever it was, you can't be doing it.

450
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:50,622
All right? I mean, this is a serious...
Shit, he's here.

451
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:53,094
This is a serious problem.

452
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,628
Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9/11.

453
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,242
What are we gonna do?

454
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,373
You say, "Yes, sir," and you say, "No, sir,"

455
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,381
and you say,
"lt will never happen again, sir."

456
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,814
And then we just prayto God
that he's in a good mood.

457
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,150
UFC?

458
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,964
Yeah.

459
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,666
Son of a bitch.

460
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,268
-Superintendent Yorn. Good to see you, sir.
-Principal Zito.

461
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,382
What are you doing?

462
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,352
Well,

463
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,797
the girls have an important piano recital
in the morning.

464
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,697
And we have an equipment malfunction.

465
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,441
How'd it go?

466
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:17,446
They're gonna reviewyour case
at the end ofthe semester.

467
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:21,985
But until then,
you're suspended without pay.

468
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,322
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

469
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,065
Howthe hell are we gonna pay
for an attorney?

470
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,329
He talked to me for free as a favorto Joe.

471
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,631
That's nice.

472
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,330
He said there's no precedent forthis.

473
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,632
You'll be back by next semester.

474
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,677
The next semester?

475
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,454
Tess,

476
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,686
they have these smoker fights all over.

477
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:09,700
There's one in Lancaster next week,
there's two in Dover the week after.

478
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,860
Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore.

479
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,737
That could keep us afloat.

480
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:25,008
You're gonna put yourselfthrough this
over and over for 500 bucks a pop?

481
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,285
Some ofthem pay a lot more than that.

482
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:37,151
I wouldt have to bounce for a month
to make what I made in two hours last night.

483
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,096
Yeah.

484
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,191
And these guys, they're not real fighters.

485
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,836
They're just guys that have seen
too much UFC on TV.

486
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,414
Now, ifyou have a better solution,

487
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,747
I'm all ears, but...

488
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,223
And what are we gonnatell the girls?

489
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,353
It'll be fine.

490
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,055
I'll just leave the house as usual,

491
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,156
except, onlythis time,
I'll be going to the gym.

492
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,805
The duck goes
quack, quack, quack, quack

493
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,683
And the cow goes
moo, moo, moo!

494
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:41,918
But that rooster
That rooster, he knew everything

495
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,184
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

496
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,594
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

497
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,428
Let's go, kiddo. Let's get moving.

498
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,962
Look what I found

499
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,704
in that disaster of a...

500
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,074
...basement.

501
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,548
What do you say we sit down

502
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,744
and update this?

503
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:13,282
And you can fill me in
on how close you got to that record.

504
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:21,130
Did you continue wrestling
afteryou left with your mother?

505
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,930
Come on, Tommy. Tell me something.

506
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,032
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

507
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,738
You can take that back
to where you found it,

508
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,281
you can leave the coffee in the pot.

509
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,181
I can pourthat myself.

510
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,686
And I can wake myself up, too.

511
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,758
Hurt my knees
coming up and down those stairs.

512
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,302
Yeah?

513
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:04,932
I'll leave the coffee pot on until 0500,
then I dump it.

514
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,048
I give command dismiss.
You'll wash your nasty bodies.

515
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,820
You can square your gear away.

516
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,619
Corporal Bradford, take this to CSC,
let them knowwe're back.

517
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,125
Roger, sir.

518
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,326
Detail, a-ten-hut!

519
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,297
7-3-4, this is Gealer Base.
Sitrep, over.

520
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,530
What's up, Mark?

521
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,162
Here, sir. William's Company's back in.

522
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,298
Damn, dude! That's brutal.

523
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,070
-Did you see that? Oh, my God.
-What?

524
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,235
What's that?

525
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:45,008
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes is getting tuned up
by some dude at a gym in Pittsburgh.

526
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,549
Who is Mad Dog Grimes?

527
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,118
Shit, Bradford,
the stuffyou don't know amazes me.

528
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,947
-Dude. Oh, my God, did you see that?
-Wow. Oh, my God.

529
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,388
-Wait. Rewind that.
-Okay.

530
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,392
Right there, pause, pause, pause.

531
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,999
What's up, man?

532
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,199
Dude, what's his deal?

533
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,105
You're not gonna get your 11.

534
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,280
-AV, I need to see the tape.
-What tape?

535
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,307
-What tape?
-The tape!

536
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,621
Hoolihan, fill in for me?

537
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,057
Get the camera.

538
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,258
That's him.

539
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,493
That's him.

540
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,401
Let the music sink into you.
This is Beethoven.

541
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,996
I want you to breathe. I don't want
you boxing like this. No more stiff, right?

542
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:20,076
You listen to the music.
You relax, you breathe. One, two...

543
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,780
Again. One, two. One, two. One, two.

544
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,024
Good.

545
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,552
Good, good, good. Yos.

546
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:41,293
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it.
All right? Two more rounds.

547
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,666
Do I knowyou?

548
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,399
-Oh, man!
-Wow.

549
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,308
-Long time, brother. Too long.
-Howyou doing?

550
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:56,709
-Too long.
-Look at your place.

551
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:57,781
-You like?
-Yeah.

552
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,715
You see this beast? Marco Santos.

553
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,684
-He's training for Sparta.
-Yeah, right.

554
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,118
Not bad, right?

555
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,917
It's amazing, man.

556
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,790
Onlythe best. Move! Move! Move!
Move or die!

557
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,590
-You look good, brother.
-Thanks.

558
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,030
How are the girls?

559
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,936
Good. Yeah. I had another little one, Rosie.

560
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,000
I know. I know because Johnny C. told me
that she was in the hospital for a bit.

561
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,374
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

562
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,540
You know,

563
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,510
I was gonna call you
and then time went by and...

564
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:39,452
I'm a piece of shit. I should've called you.
I'm sorry.

565
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,524
-No. Come on.
-No.

566
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:44,188
Brendan, I'm sorry.

567
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,159
It's all good. She's good now.

568
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,198
-She's okay?
-So beautiful.

569
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:58,040
It's good to see you, man.
So everything's going great, huh?

570
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,541
Yeah.

571
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:04,002
Well, I've got a little problem.

572
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,083
The guys at the bank
want to take my house away.

573
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,881
-What?
-Yeah.

574
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,488
That's kind ofwhy
I came to see you, actually.

575
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,332
You know, I got most of my dough
tied up in this joint,

576
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,559
but how much do you need?

577
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,463
I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.

578
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,300
I mean, I was hoping that

579
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,766
you would train me.

580
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,578
Train you forwhat?

581
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,976
I wanna get back in the cage.

582
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,349
Are you serious?

583
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,085
Come on, Brendan.

584
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,013
I won an event the other night.

585
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:50,158
You won an event. That's what this is.

586
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,889
Let me guess. It was in a parking lot?
DJ from a local radio station,

587
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:57,456
a couple of ring card girls
you wouldn't bang on a dare? Am I right?

588
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,064
-lsh.
-lsh.

589
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,505
Brendan. I love you.

590
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,038
Why am I gonnatrain you?

591
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,712
When you were on the right side of 30,
you were barely a.500 fighter.

592
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,783
You never listened to me.

593
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,251
You don't listen to anyone.
These guys are animals.

594
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,416
You're ateacher, right?
What are you gonna do?

595
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:26,053
You're gonna come down here
a couple of days aweek after detention?

596
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,724
You're gonna skip out
ofthe girls' volleyball game early?

597
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,691
I've got loads oftime. Time's not an issue.

598
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,969
Parking lot thing kind of got me suspended.

599
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:46,506
I need to keep working the smokers.

600
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,979
Tess know about this?

601
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,521
Yeah?

602
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,785
'Cause the last time you fought,
I got read the riot act,

603
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,760
sitting in a hospital waiting room.
You rememberthat?

604
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,955
I was unconscious.

605
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,967
-You were more than unconscious.
-I was.

606
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:09,403
She's not gonna come down here
with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

607
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:13,135
It's not gonna happen.

608
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,232
What do you say, Frank?

609
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,142
What do I say?
What am I gonna sayto you? "No"?

610
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,308
I mean, all mytime
is wrapped up with Marco.

611
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,444
You know, you come down, I throwyou
in a rotation, you sparwith these guys.

612
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:29,117
But I can't promise you
much more than that, Brendan.

613
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,557
That's all I need.

614
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,919
Great. All right.

615
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,463
Yeah.

616
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,556
-I appreciate it.
-What, are you kidding me?

617
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,934
-You need anything, you call me.
-I will.

618
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,366
Let me knowwhen you're coming down.

619
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,996
Well, I'm just gonna get
my stuff from the car.

620
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,408
Now?

621
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,564
Hey, Brendan.

622
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,929
Brendan, it's me, Pop.

623
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,771
What are you doing here?

624
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:25,978
I have some news foryou.

625
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,919
Something wrong with your hands?

626
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,353
-No.
-lfthere's nothing wrong with your hands,

627
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,788
there's no reason foryou not to phone.

628
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,424
-That's the deal.
-Yeah. I forgot.

629
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,553
The phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.

630
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:43,656
Hey, Brendan.
You ever seen my hands so steady?

631
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,359
Ever seen that?

632
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,129
I'm going inside.

633
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,537
I got 1,000 days, Brendan.

634
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,009
Thousand days sober, today.

635
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,807
Well, that's great, Pop,
but it doesn't change anything.

636
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:58,973
What do you mean,
doesn't change anything?

637
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,141
Have a heart, Brendan.

638
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,609
You listen to me.

639
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,746
You take your "have a heart" bullshit
and you run it down the road.

640
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,918
Yeah, run it out with someone
that doesn't knowyou like I do.

641
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:14,361
All right, listen to me.
I thought maybe we could break bread.

642
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,627
You know,
just open some lines of communication.

643
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:22,970
You got two lines of communication.
You got the telephone and the post office.

644
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,506
God! Just 'cause you decide
it's a special day,

645
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,734
it doesn't make it one for me.

646
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,811
I've got awife and kids inside,
and they're waiting for me,

647
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,538
so I don't have time forwhateverthis is.

648
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,446
I knowyou got awife and kid in there.
I've got a granddaughter in there

649
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,313
I haven't seen in three years.

650
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,147
And another one I haven't even ever met.

651
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,255
Yeah. Why is that, Pop?

652
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,222
Why is that?

653
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,391
Do you remember
having anything to do with that?

654
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,361
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

655
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,761
That shit you pulled.

656
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,163
Never again.

657
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,697
And all that shit I saw growing up,

658
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,334
-that doesn't happen here.
-Look...

659
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:04,774
Take care ofyourself.

660
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,042
Tommy's back.

661
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,356
He's in the 'Burgh.

662
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,062
You say Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

663
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,396
Yeah, he came to see me.

664
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,868
He came to see you?

665
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,632
Yeah. He's over at the house.

666
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:37,675
We're doing a little training at Fitzy's.

667
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,475
You remember Fitzy's?

668
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,414
It ain't Fitzy's anymore.

669
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,486
You and Tommy are training together?

670
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,215
Yeah.

671
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,223
-Tommy Conlon?
-Riordan.

672
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:53,327
-He's using your mother's maiden name.
-Yeah, I knowwhat her name is.

673
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:58,094
Well, I thought you'd wanna know he's back.
So that's why I drove all the way over here.

674
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,261
I thought you came to break bread
over 1,000 days.

675
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,601
No, I did, Brendan, that's most important.

676
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,436
That, too.

677
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,973
All right. Did he say if he wants to see me?

678
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,416
He doesn't say much, Brendan.

679
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,492
He's just not that happy kid he was,
you know?

680
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:25,785
-Wow. Look at you.
-What?

681
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,022
Mr. Inside Man.

682
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,930
Inside? What?

683
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:33,060
You and Tommytraining together like
nothing ever happened. It's unbelievable.

684
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,865
-Look...
-Now I knowwhat you're really doing here.

685
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,371
-What's that?
-You came to gloat.

686
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,203
I did not come to gloat.
I came to get my son back.

687
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,436
Wow. There you go.
Yeah, you got your son back.

688
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,537
-No, I'm talking about you, Brendan. You.
-You got your son back.

689
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,381
You know...

690
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,152
Forget it.

691
00:49:55,392 --> 00:50:01,388
Yeah, I'll tell you. Part ofthe reason...
Part ofthe reason I stuck around,

692
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,557
'cause I thought I'd finally get you
all to myself.

693
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,502
But you didn't have any interest
in training me.

694
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:13,039
-You thought Tommywas the one.
-Brendan, I was a drunk.

695
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,169
I mean, you know, Brendan, I'm sorry.

696
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,246
Forget it.

697
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:22,848
You were always a frontrunner.
Never had any interest in the underdogs.

698
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:28,255
-But I was your son.
-You are my son, Brendan.

699
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,485
-Am l?
-Yeah, you are.

700
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,487
I'm just asking you ifyou can find...

701
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:42,667
Find a little bit of space in your heart
to forgive me a little bit.

702
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:49,005
Yeah? All right, I forgive you.

703
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,044
-Okay.
-But I do not trust you.

704
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,746
Listen, tell Tommy, if he wants to see me,
this is where I am.

705
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,114
-Okay. But they're not different things.
-All right?

706
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,125
You gottatrust to forgive.

707
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,189
Night, Pop.

708
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,388
My God.

709
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:11,496
Is that Emily? Jeez, she's grown, Brendan.

710
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,366
-ls that Rosie?
-Daddy, who is that?

711
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,803
It's just a nice, old man. Come on. Let's go.

712
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,772
How about a cup of coffee?

713
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,686
Huge news just broken here at ESPN

714
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:41,855
that Koba is coming to America
and will fight at Sparta.

715
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,863
Universally considered
the greatest pound-for-pound fighter

716
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,766
who ever lived, the mighty,
mythical Russian has never fought

717
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,099
on US soil in his legendary career.

718
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,434
Slow to half guard.
Slow to half guard, hammer fist.

719
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:58,708
Now start on the other side.
And slip back in, there you go.

720
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,147
Tommy,

721
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,583
I got some news for you.

722
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:04,711
I got you into Sparta.

723
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,620
It took some doing,

724
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,748
but I made it happen.

725
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:15,798
You know thank you and 10% is customary?

726
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,078
Pilar? Hey, it's Tommy.

727
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,345
Tommy?

728
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,254
Okay. Sorry.

729
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,722
Good. I'm good. How are you doing?

730
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,998
Okay. You know me, Tommy.

731
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,471
I was getting really worried about you.

732
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,908
How's things? How are the kids?
The kids good?

733
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,206
Yeah, they're good.

734
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,272
-Maria's getting so big.
-Yeah?

735
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:10,047
She looks more and more like Manny
every day.

736
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:15,591
-How's little man?
-He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy.

737
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:19,458
He's a real good boy.
He takes care of his sister.

738
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,861
-He's a great kid. Everyone's good.
-Good.

739
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,762
-We're good.
-Good.

740
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,401
You know...

741
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:32,468
Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute

742
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:35,670
what I promised you.

743
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,146
What I promised Manny.
I got opportunities coming up, so...

744
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,718
Whatever you can do, Tommy.

745
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,344
Help you guys out.
I'm gonna take care of you guys.

746
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:48,822
I know. Manny would really appreciate it.

747
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,453
-I wanna help you.
-You know what? You worry too much.

748
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,689
You worry so much about us. It's okay.

749
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,096
You know what? We're hanging in there.

750
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,034
"Captain Pollard once more sailed
for the Pacific in command of another ship,

751
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:05,335
"but the gods shipwrecked him again
upon unknown rocks and breakers.

752
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:08,673
"For the second time,
his ship was utterly lost,

753
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:12,077
"and forthwith forswearing the sea,
he has never tempted it since. "

754
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,042
Stop for a second. Listen to the music.
This is Beethoven.

755
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:20,218
Could you do another thing?
Or are you gonna do the same thing?

756
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,850
I need you to relax and listen.
Forget about how to lose the fight.

757
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,951
And two, and three.

758
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,686
With eight weeks left to Sparta,

759
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,560
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew

760
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,601
take time out from their international
press tour to join us.

761
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,330
J.J., we've never seen
this kind of Grand Prix tournament

762
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,407
in this country before.
Tell us, why the unique format?

763
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:42,402
Well, look, Jon, you know as well as anyone
that in mixed martial arts,

764
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,707
anyone can beat anyone on a given night.

765
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,543
But with this type of format,

766
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,277
it's gonna be tough
to deny who the champion is.

767
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:54,323
You got four fights in two nights,
16 fighters down to one,

768
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,119
winner's gonna be the last man standing.

769
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,126
Thirty-one. Thirty-two!

770
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,790
Breathe, breathe. Keep your eyes open.

771
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,632
You gotta keep moving.
You gotta keep moving. Keep moving.

772
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:08,431
Good! And listen to the music. You breathe.
He's getting it. He's getting it.

773
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,129
You see? You feel it? Feel the music.

774
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,232
-Come on!
-Nice.

775
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,239
Come on, baby!

776
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,838
...with Rashad Evans and Stephan Bonnar
andjust five weeks left until Sparta,

777
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:23,908
as the hype continues for the war
on the shore this Fourth of July weekend

778
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,920
in Atlantic City. You know what that means.

779
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,752
The great Koba bringing his act stateside.

780
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:30,655
But I gotta ask you about the other guys.

781
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,695
What are they thinking,
entering a winner-take-all tournament

782
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,355
against a guy
that seemingly can't be beaten?

783
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,193
They're thinking $5 million
and $5 million seems a lot of money,

784
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,826
but they gotta remember one thing.
They're going against Koba.

785
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,269
Mission impossible, game over, go home.

786
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:45,034
Well, the winner takes home $5 million.

787
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:47,769
You can be sure
this will dominate the sports landscape

788
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:49,742
Fourth of July weekend in Atlantic City.

789
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:53,839
The great Koba making his presence felt
in the United States.

790
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,415
Two... Come on, Tommy.

791
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,679
Hits you soft, right? Flow like water.

792
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,614
Get on your arm,
watch what's gonna happen.

793
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,889
There it is. Look, look, look.
He's going to sleep.

794
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,460
You train with the best
to be the best, Brendan.

795
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,533
Pittsburgh Beatdown has become
one ofthe most watched videos

796
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:14,296
on YouTube this year.

797
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:17,737
Nowjoining us, via satellite,
is the victim of the infamous incident,

798
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:18,899
Mad Dog Grimes.

799
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:22,876
Mad Dog, what is your response
to all the hoopla surrounding the video

800
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:24,037
and Tommy Riordan?

801
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,638
This guy's a nobody.
It's a sparring session.

802
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,241
It is what it is,
and he's gonna pay for it next month

803
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,718
in Atlantic City.

804
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:34,080
Good. Always move. Always move.

805
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,557
I don't know, Marco. You're getting
a good game here from a physics teacher.

806
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:39,790
Good! Good.

807
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,588
You see? You see? Beautiful.

808
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,963
Top ofthe food chain.
He's the next champ, right here.

809
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,143
So, with Sparta now
just two short weeks away,

810
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,079
J.J. Riley and the Tapout crew
return to the US

811
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:03,642
after a world tour that saw them visit
10 fighters in 10 different countries.

812
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,347
They stopped in Philadelphia today
to check in on renowned trainer,

813
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,581
Frank Campana,

814
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,420
and top contender, Marco Santos.

815
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,927
You gotta relax and stay calm in there.

816
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,860
The cage is your home.

817
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,363
You set the pace.

818
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:18,093
You set the rhythm.

819
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,202
Feel the Beethoven.

820
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:24,000
Be smarter than him, more patient.
Wait for him to make a mistake.

821
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,904
And when he does, that's your moment.

822
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,739
I see it. I see it. I see it.

823
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:32,140
No, he did not tap you!

824
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,983
Physics teacher!
That's the best in the business, son.

825
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,451
You can do this, Son!

826
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:42,286
Smoother. There's more in you!
You got more in you!

827
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,416
We're not done yet!

828
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:46,359
He's beating you! He's beating you!

829
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,398
You better push harder, Marco!
Brendan's running away!

830
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:55,470
And the winner by tap out

831
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,370
"Irish" Brendan Conlon.

832
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,983
"...to each and every man in turn
but mirrors back his own mysterious self.

833
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:13,044
"Great pains, small gains
for those who ask the world to solve them.

834
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,647
"It cannot solve itself. "

835
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,039
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

836
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,476
-You wanna grab a bite?
-No. I'm gonna head home.

837
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,310
I gotta call the boys and break the news.

838
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,086
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Okay.

839
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,329
Coach!

840
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:02,227
Hey, I knowthis is not a really great time,

841
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:05,466
and it's too bad about Marco.

842
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:09,877
But how about me?

843
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,515
Are you talking about Sparta?

844
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,183
Yeah.

845
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,877
Brendan, you've got a better shot
at starting a boy band.

846
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:17,953
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

847
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,824
It's a Grand Prix tournament.

848
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,662
Which means anything could happen.
You knowthat as well as I do.

849
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,238
Yeah.

850
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,074
Come on. They'd have to kill me
to get me out ofthe cage.

851
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:43,012
That's what I'm afraid of.

852
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,579
Frank, I need this.

853
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,647
You're real tight with these guys.
You could call them.

854
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:52,553
You're the guy. Theytrust you.

855
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:58,555
Brendan.

856
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,629
You realize
what you're asking me to do here?

857
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,197
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

858
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:05,392
We go down to AC,
you get tapped out in five seconds.

859
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,298
How does that benefit either one of us?

860
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,600
-It's not gonna happen.
-Not gonna happen?

861
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,607
Wish I had a nickel
for everytime somebodytold me that.

862
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,903
It's not gonna happen.

863
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,827
I'll make a call.

864
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:41,966
I love my coach!

865
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,816
Yeah, they're good. The girls are good.
They're good.

866
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,009
Yeah, he should.

867
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,644
I mean, you've been spending
so much time with Brendan these days,

868
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:01,747
it's like you're part ofthe family
or something.

869
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,452
Yeah, he's right here. It's your boyfriend.

870
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,123
Frank. Hey, man.

871
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,473
That's unbelievable.

872
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,580
Wow! Wow, Frank, I can't thankyou enough.
I don't knowwhat to say.

873
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:30,318
All right, listen, I gotta call you back, okay?

874
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,188
All right. Bye.

875
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:41,053
I'm in.

876
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,461
-I'm going.
-Really?

877
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:49,071
That's your decision? You decided?

878
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,368
'Cause I really enjoyed the conversation
we just had

879
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,445
about making that decision together.

880
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:04,911
You told me you were gonna fight guys
that watched too much UFC.

881
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,216
I sawthe Koba dude on the television,

882
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,188
and he's the guythey're watching.

883
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,259
It's a lot of money, Tess.

884
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:12,827
I don't give a shit about the money,
Brendan. I told you that.

885
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:16,088
We're gonna end up
cashing in your life insurance policy

886
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:17,598
before we pick up that prize money.

887
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,526
You don't think I can do it, right?

888
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,600
I thinkyou could get killed.

889
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:28,706
-I'm not gonna get killed.
-You're not gonna get killed,

890
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:30,210
but you promised me
you're not gonna get hurt.

891
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,907
You're not gonna end up in the hospital.
You're not gonna end up paralyzed.

892
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,506
We have no prize money, we have no house.

893
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:38,610
-We have payments for hospital bills.
-Tess! Listen, I'll promise you this.

894
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,216
If I don't try in three weeks,
they're gonnatake the house.

895
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:46,853
How's that for a promise?

896
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,731
So, I'm gonna go, okay?

897
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:57,067
But I'd really love it
ifyou'd be with me on this.

898
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,615
I'm not gonnawatch you fight again,
I'm not.

899
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:09,082
I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.

900
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:42,477
Fourth of Julyweekend
doesn't officially getstarted until tomorrow,

901
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,019
but fight fans are already descending
on Atlantic City

902
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:48,921
for the Super Bowl
of mixed martial arts, Sparta!

903
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:51,823
We've got the dancing girls,
we've got the paparazzi,

904
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,293
we've got the red carpet!

905
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:56,888
And here comes J.J. Riley,
the man who started it all.

906
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,797
J.J., you've made a fortune
with your hedge funds.

907
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,592
You turned your back on Wall Street

908
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:04,036
and dedicated your life
to making Sparta happen.

909
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,337
Tell us why this tournament
is so important to you?

910
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:08,567
Growing up, we all wanted to know

911
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,873
who the toughest kid
in the neighborhood was, right?

912
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,777
I wanna know
who the toughest man on the planet is.

913
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:14,577
And that's why I put this thing together.

914
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,448
That's what all these people are here to see,
come Saturday night.

915
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,885
-That's what we're gonna find out.
-Thank you, J.J.

916
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:24,653
And here's something fans never thought
they'd see. Koba is here.

917
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,161
The legend arriving to fight on US soil
for the very first time.

918
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,253
-Koba! Koba!
-Koba! Koba!

919
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:32,300
Olympic gold medalist in wrestling,
world Sambo champion,

920
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,199
undefeated in his mixed martial arts career.

921
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:38,330
Nobody's survived a round
with the Russian in five years.

922
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,932
He is the greatest fighter...

923
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,754
I mean, you've seen our logos.

924
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:56,051
No, yeah, I've seen your stuff. It looks good.

925
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,726
I mean, is he fighting after Sparta?

926
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:59,886
I mean, we're trying to find
some info on him.

927
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,463
No, I'm not sure.

928
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,520
Hey, where'd you go? Where'd you go?

929
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:38,293
You can't leave me like that.
Theywant to talkto you, not me.

930
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:39,534
-Frank Campana?
-Yeah.

931
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,330
Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

932
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,200
-Julia, how are you?
-Brendan Conlon?

933
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,137
-Yeah, hi. Hey.
-Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

934
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,401
-Right, hi. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

935
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,703
A fewthings I want to let you guys know.

936
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,711
-Press conference will start in 20 minutes.
-Okay.

937
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:52,974
Brendan, you're gonna be sitting up
on the stage.

938
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:54,344
Tommy!

939
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,551
Hey, Tommy! Where you going?

940
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:58,548
Can we stand with J.J.?

941
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,222
"Hearing the tremendous rush
of the sea-crashing boat,

942
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:02,124
"the whale wheeled round
to present his blank forehead at bay.

943
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:05,252
"the whale wheeled round
to present his blank forehead at bay.

944
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:09,593
"But in that evolution, catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship,

945
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:13,430
"seemingly seeing in it
the source of all his persecutions,

946
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:17,666
"bethinking it,
it may be a larger and nobler foe.

947
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:21,368
"Of a sudden,
he bore down upon its advancing prow,

948
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:25,379
"smiting his jaws
amid fiery showers of foam.

949
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:28,913
"Ahab staggered,
his hand smote his forehead.

950
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,747
"'I grow blind... "'

951
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,582
Now, the only person missing
from the event

952
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,179
was dark horse entry, Tommy Riordan.

953
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:39,193
Recent revelations that Riordan
was not only a United States Marine,

954
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:43,129
but a hero in the Iraq War,
has cast an even wider spotlight

955
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:45,826
on a fighter
who seems to have come out of nowhere.

956
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,961
Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's
Web testimony to Riordan,

957
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,539
who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq,

958
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,575
is now spreading like wildfire
throughout the media.

959
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,769
Tommy!

960
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,368
And the bridge just crumbled.

961
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,210
Tommy, come here.
Come on. You got to see this.

962
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:05,015
The amtrac was upside down
and water was coming in from everywhere.

963
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:09,153
And the water pressure was too much.
We couldn't get the back hatch open.

964
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,391
We were all drowning, man.

965
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:14,026
It was a death trap.

966
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,092
I couldn't have had more
than another minute.

967
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,900
Then suddenly,
the back ramp gets ripped off.

968
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,664
There he was.

969
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,633
And before I could get out and thank him,
he was gone.

970
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,609
-He just vanished like a ghost.
-Tommy?

971
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,944
-Tommy, did you... Where you going?
-Taking a walk.

972
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:36,475
Tommy!

973
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:39,787
I reallyjust wanted to say thank you.

974
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,049
You saved my life, brother.

975
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:48,557
And anyone seeing this at Sparta,
anybody out in Pittsburgh,

976
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:52,563
you reach out to Tommy Riordan
and tell him Mark said, "Thank you. "

977
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:55,569
Footage taken from a helmet cam
on the ground in Iraq

978
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,003
captured the heroic incident.

979
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,369
Hello?

980
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:00,933
Brendan?

981
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,445
Been looking all over for you.

982
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:49,056
How's it going?

983
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,819
It's going.

984
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:56,093
I was thinking we should go grab a coffee.

985
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,533
I don't drink coffee, man.
What do you want?

986
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,064
You don't wanna go sit down somewhere?

987
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:08,771
I'm good right here.

988
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:11,973
Okay.

989
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:21,547
Shit, Tommy, howwas I supposed to know
I was never gonna see you guys again?

990
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:22,988
Yeah, well, you were briefed.

991
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,326
You had the information.

992
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:31,558
You chose the old man and the girl.

993
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,658
She wasn't just some girl.

994
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,068
I married her.

995
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,900
She's mywife.

996
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,173
See?

997
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,647
That's Tess.

998
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,116
That's Emily and Rosie.

999
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,346
They're your nieces, Tommy.

1000
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,046
I don't knowthem.

1001
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:57,956
I knowyou don't knowthem.
Of course you don't knowthem.

1002
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:01,559
So why am I looking at pictures
of people I don't know?

1003
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,665
'Cause that's my family.

1004
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:08,664
And who are you exactly?

1005
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,106
I'm your brother, man.

1006
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,811
You were in the Corps?

1007
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,749
What?

1008
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:25,081
-I said I didn't knowyou were in the Corps.
-I wasn't in the Corps.

1009
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,516
Then you ain't no brotherto me.

1010
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,123
My brotherwas in the Corps.

1011
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:33,351
Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.

1012
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:36,896
I was a 16-year-old kid.
What the hell did I know?

1013
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,424
I don't knowwhat you know.

1014
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:40,092
Why don't you go askyour girlfriend
about it?

1015
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,794
She's mywife, Tommy.

1016
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:45,168
So, that's it? I staywith Tess,
I never get to see you guys again?

1017
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,640
Not a single phone call? Nothing?

1018
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:51,644
God, man, I don't understand this.

1019
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,813
What? You...

1020
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:57,545
So, you won't forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

1021
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:03,886
No, he's just some old vet that I train with,
you know? He means nothing to me.

1022
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:08,325
And what I hear,
he means nothing to you, either.

1023
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:13,028
You got balls talking about forgiveness.

1024
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,864
That has nothing to do with forgiveness.

1025
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,768
I got children, man. I got a familyto protect.

1026
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,807
Everything I do is forthem.

1027
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,367
I forgave Pop.

1028
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:24,275
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

1029
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,177
You forgave us?

1030
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,386
Yeah.

1031
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,485
Well, I'm not surprised
you made the tournament, Brendan.

1032
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,654
You got some stones, man.

1033
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:44,324
I fell in love.
What the hell was I supposed to do?

1034
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:47,129
You were supposed to stickto the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

1035
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:50,672
Mom needed you, I needed you.
You're my big brother. You bailed on me.

1036
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,634
Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.
Everything worked out foryou.

1037
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:55,732
God.

1038
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:59,473
You leave, you get the opposite. Okay?

1039
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,209
You leave, you get to bury people.

1040
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,219
You're not the only one
that suffered, Tommy.

1041
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,420
I didn't even know she was sick.

1042
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:14,554
I never even got the chance to say goodbye
to my own mother.

1043
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:21,091
You had no right to keep that from me.
That was not your decision to make!

1044
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,569
You know what?

1045
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:29,075
You walk around
with your pictures ofyourwife,

1046
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,442
and you're all, "l forgive you.

1047
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:34,071
"l forgive Pop.

1048
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:36,344
"l forgive everyone."

1049
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:37,919
Brendan, you know,

1050
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,384
you're full of shit.

1051
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:50,190
Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?

1052
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,753
You realize you're supposed to seek
mywise counsel

1053
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:14,948
while school's actually in session, right?

1054
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,957
-Yes, Principal Z.
-Tell him.

1055
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,323
Okay, we wanna use the auditorium
this weekend

1056
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:21,396
to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

1057
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,124
What do you say?

1058
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,893
So, you want to use the auditorium

1059
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,595
to watch a suspended teacher engage
in the activity that he was suspended for?

1060
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:29,932
-Right.
-Am I hearing this correct?

1061
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,869
Right. Okay, we thought you would say that,

1062
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,771
so it could turn into a fundraiser,
you know?

1063
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,934
You know,
I thinkyou need to talk to your parents,

1064
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:38,137
because you guys might need
to be in summer school.

1065
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,646
-Everybodywants this.
-Come on, Mr. Zito.

1066
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,215
We've been telling everybody
about it already.

1067
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:42,305
-Exactly.
-And the gym's the only place

1068
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,682
-that's big enough to fit everyone.
-Look, it's never gonna happen.

1069
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,278
-What ifwe get a petition signed?
-We'll get the whole school to sign it.

1070
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:49,220
-The power of democracy.
-What are they gonna do about that?

1071
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:50,291
Mr. Z, please?

1072
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:53,418
Look, look, you guys. I appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher, I really do,

1073
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,521
but there is nothing I can do for you.

1074
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:34,163
The roof is about to blow clean off
Boardwalk Hall Arena.

1075
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:39,172
It might be Fourth of July weekend,
but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.

1076
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:43,472
This is Atlantic City.
This is the War on the Shore,

1077
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:46,446
and this is
what everyone's been waiting for.

1078
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:51,383
Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24-hour period

1079
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,888
for the largest purse
in mixed martial arts history.

1080
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,982
In the town everyone knows
from the game of Monopoly,

1081
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:01,085
we got ourselves a winner-take-all affair.

1082
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:06,498
Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice,
and take a ride on the Reading.

1083
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:09,662
Sparta is here!

1084
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:11,769
Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,

1085
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,604
along with bestselling fight author,
Sam Sheridan.

1086
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:17,769
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,

1087
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,745
he wanted to create, quite simply,

1088
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:23,716
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle
in history.

1089
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:27,045
$5 million, Bryan. $5 million.

1090
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:29,555
J.J. Riley put his moneywhere his mouth is

1091
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:33,059
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen.

1092
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,924
It's unprecedented, Sam.

1093
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:39,330
As is the hoopla surrounding
one Tommy Riordan, the war hero,

1094
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,868
who has become an overnight sensation

1095
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,938
and captured the imagination
and attention...

1096
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,774
...Jujitsu black belt Francisco Barbosa,

1097
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:53,109
who has a 19 to four record
in his mixed martial arts' career.

1098
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,913
Our rules of the cage are brought to you
by Tapout.

1099
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:01,650
-Five minutes, Paddy.
-Okay.

1100
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:07,286
It looks as though the moment of truth
has arrived,

1101
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,092
-because here comes Tommy Riordan.
-Wow!

1102
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:12,393
Tommy Riordan's
captured the media's attention,

1103
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,401
but the question still remains.

1104
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:15,864
Who is this guy?

1105
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,438
And more importantly,

1106
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:20,440
can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win?

1107
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,271
I wish I knew. I wish I knew who he was.

1108
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:26,074
And I say the fact that I don't know
is very strange.

1109
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:28,308
In an lnternet age
where there are no secrets,

1110
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,282
this guy's a complete mystery.

1111
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:32,319
I can't find out anything about him.

1112
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:35,456
Tommy Riordan is officially Google-proof.

1113
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,124
Get your hands off me.

1114
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:42,452
Okay, let's go.

1115
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,860
You gotta love this guy, Sam.

1116
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:46,833
No walk-out music,
no sponsors, no interviews.

1117
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,766
He skipped the press conference,

1118
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,236
wouldn't have his picture taken
forthe program.

1119
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,069
He's breaking every rule.

1120
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:56,403
The only reason, really,
that Tommy Riordan is in this tournament

1121
01:16:56,511 --> 01:17:01,005
is an MMAvideo making the rounds of him
beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.

1122
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,812
But the reason
that a lot of his fans are in the stands

1123
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:05,477
is because of anothervideo.

1124
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:08,215
It's even more stunning
than the Mad Dog Grimes video.

1125
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:10,052
This guy... Let me describe it to you, folks,

1126
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,456
forthe fewthat haven't seen it,
and I don't know anybodywho hasn't,

1127
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:16,053
but Tommy Riordan ripped the door
off atank

1128
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:19,133
in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,

1129
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:21,168
and then walked away
without claiming a medal.

1130
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,566
-Listen...
-He ripped the door off atank.

1131
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,536
Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero.

1132
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,973
I'm not taking anything away from the guy,
he's avery, verytough guy,

1133
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,704
-but the tank don't hit back, you know.
-Sam...

1134
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,212
We've seen YouTube sensations fail
on a big stage before.

1135
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,749
Sam, he ripped the door off atank!

1136
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,351
Tommy Riordan,
he has definitely got his hands full

1137
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,924
in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa.

1138
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:45,459
-Francisco Barbosa...
-He's nothing to scoff at.

1139
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,255
Yeah, he's the octopus. He's the real deal.

1140
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:51,525
He's a very, very tough guy,
a very high-caliber fighter.

1141
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,260
Now, Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere,

1142
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,734
and I'd imagine he's gonna disappear
just as quickly.

1143
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:56,826
It's a great story,

1144
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:59,930
but I think your boy
is gonna be exposed here

1145
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:01,508
-as a YouTube sensation.
-Well, well,

1146
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,670
a lot of fans here in Boardwalk Hall
hope you're wrong, Sam.

1147
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,942
All right, gentlemen,
you've been given your instructions.

1148
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,573
I expect a clean fight.

1149
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:09,981
Obey my command at all times,

1150
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,347
defend yourselves at all times.

1151
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,244
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1152
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,882
Tommy, cut offthe corners,
feel this guy out,

1153
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,426
just like we know. Just like we know.

1154
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,395
We're about to get the big answer
to the big question.

1155
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:24,658
Is Tommy Riordan for real?

1156
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,961
-Gentlemen, you ready?
-They are both game fighters.

1157
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,798
-And here we go.
-You ready?

1158
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,028
Let's go to war!

1159
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:31,696
Keep your focus, Tom.

1160
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:33,502
And here we go. We're gonna see this.

1161
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:34,973
Barbosa's gonna be looking for atakedown.

1162
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,102
He's definitely looking for atakedown here.

1163
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,947
Barbosa is down!
Barbosa has been knocked out!

1164
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:48,216
Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real.

1165
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:51,850
And now he's walking out ofthe cage.
He's leaving the cage.

1166
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,484
Hey, Tommy!

1167
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:55,654
There goes another rule, out the window!

1168
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:57,796
Where you going?

1169
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,928
Francisco Barbosa is out cold,

1170
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,664
and he is out ofthis tournament, Bryan.

1171
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,597
-A huge left hook, launching...
-Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

1172
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:09,541
-...Tommy Riordan into the second round.
-One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.

1173
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:12,169
Good. Two, three.

1174
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,941
Good. Good, good, good.

1175
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:16,882
-Good. Come on. Good. One, two.
-Tommy Riordan is the real deal.

1176
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:21,047
-Showtime.
-All right. Come on, give me eight.

1177
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,719
Yes! That's my boy.

1178
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,329
Let's go, move your head around.

1179
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,302
You ready?

1180
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:23,515
Look at me.

1181
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:29,118
You can do this.

1182
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,493
I wanna hearyou say it.

1183
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,130
I can do this.

1184
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,632
Let's go do this.

1185
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:49,604
Yeah.

1186
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:55,942
Yeah.

1187
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:07,586
J.J. Riley only had 48 hours,
less than 48 hours, to fill the spot.

1188
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,563
And basically, he had to go on the road
to Frank Campana.

1189
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,724
Well, then he chose Brendan Conlon,

1190
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:14,563
which is really something
I don't understand.

1191
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:16,603
I just... I'm shocked.

1192
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,706
Hey, Brendan. Brendan, go get him.

1193
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,076
Go. Good luck.

1194
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:30,844
Let's go, Brendan.

1195
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:33,584
You go get him, Son!

1196
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:35,747
You know, I can understand
coming out to no music,

1197
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:39,349
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance?

1198
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:42,259
This is Beethoven.
This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.

1199
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,264
My apologies, Mr. Renaissance Man.

1200
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:47,494
Go get him, Son.

1201
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:51,163
Ifyou wannatalk about Renaissance men,
you gottatalk about Frank Campana.

1202
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:54,265
Very unorthodoxtrainer,
but one ofthe best trainers in the game,

1203
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:58,602
and he's well known for using classical
musicto teach his fighters to remain calm,

1204
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:02,114
to remain patient,
and to remain composed under pressure.

1205
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:05,812
You know, I'll tell you, classical music
is about as fitting to this setting

1206
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,617
as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.

1207
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,121
-Come on.
-ln fact, let me showyou something.

1208
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,214
Right here. Let me tell you...

1209
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:12,691
-What?
-You see that, right there?

1210
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:16,594
That, right there...
That, my friend, is Brendan Conlon.

1211
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:20,562
Okay? Brendan Conlon's about
to be dropped into a sharktank.

1212
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:21,930
He's a feeder fish.

1213
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,504
Come on, give the guy a break.

1214
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,937
You know, the guy...
At least we've seen him fight.

1215
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,475
I mean, he's fought real guys.
He's been in the UFC.

1216
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:30,510
-We remember him from that.
-I remember him, too.

1217
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,637
I remember him being very unmemorable.

1218
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,163
Midnight Le getting ready
to climb into the cage and go to work.

1219
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:57,328
When the brackets were announced,

1220
01:22:57,438 --> 01:22:59,235
he thought he'd be going up
against Marco Santos.

1221
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:02,275
He's got to be thrilled to be seeing
Brendan Conlon across from him.

1222
01:23:02,376 --> 01:23:04,435
Hey! You asked for it.

1223
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:07,840
Brendan retired from fighting
some years ago.

1224
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:10,474
He's actually
a high school physics teacher now,

1225
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:13,486
and Midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday.

1226
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:16,250
Well, he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson,

1227
01:23:16,357 --> 01:23:19,690
and that getting killed was no way
to spend a summervacation.

1228
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:23,423
Midnight is known fortalking trash,
he's also known for backing it up.

1229
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,465
No question, Bryan.
He's in a lot oftrouble here.

1230
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:29,161
-Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.
-Gentlemen.

1231
01:23:31,839 --> 01:23:33,170
Go get him.

1232
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:37,934
All right, guys,
you've been given your instructions.

1233
01:23:38,045 --> 01:23:39,444
I expect a clean fight.

1234
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:43,039
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

1235
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,243
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1236
01:23:46,754 --> 01:23:48,619
Go have some fun, baby.

1237
01:23:52,893 --> 01:23:54,121
Gentlemen, you ready?

1238
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:57,789
You ready? Let's go to war!

1239
01:24:01,969 --> 01:24:03,698
Workyour kicks!

1240
01:24:03,804 --> 01:24:05,135
Workyour kicks!

1241
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:09,667
Come on, Brendan, come on.

1242
01:24:10,044 --> 01:24:11,602
Move! You gotta move, you gotta move.

1243
01:24:12,513 --> 01:24:14,208
Let it out! Come on, move!

1244
01:24:18,419 --> 01:24:20,080
Stay away from the legs! Circle!

1245
01:24:20,254 --> 01:24:21,585
In and out!

1246
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:29,462
Get offthe fence!

1247
01:24:31,098 --> 01:24:32,963
Get through this. Sprawl down!

1248
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:36,532
Get offthe fence! Get offthe fence!

1249
01:24:38,005 --> 01:24:39,404
There he goes!

1250
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:40,804
Come on, Brendan. Get out ofthere!

1251
01:24:41,475 --> 01:24:42,737
Come on!

1252
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:44,702
Get up!

1253
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,340
-Come on! Come on!
-Watch the back ofthe head!

1254
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:50,610
-Relax, you're okay. You're okay!
-Midnight is all over Brendan.

1255
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:53,186
Well, this can't last much longer.
This won't last much longer.

1256
01:24:53,287 --> 01:24:55,687
The teacher just has no answers.

1257
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,758
Get out ofthere! Get out ofthere!

1258
01:24:59,293 --> 01:25:01,557
-And now, he's got the hooks in.
-The hooks are in.

1259
01:25:01,662 --> 01:25:03,687
-Brendan in very big trouble.
-The end is close.

1260
01:25:03,831 --> 01:25:05,696
Can Brendan make the end ofthe round?

1261
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,589
Well, he's got the choke.

1262
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:09,260
-He's got 20 seconds left in the round...
-Come on.

1263
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:12,430
...and Conlon's face is turning purple.
This looks like it's over.

1264
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,838
Get up! Find his legs!

1265
01:25:14,942 --> 01:25:16,807
Hips! Hip down!

1266
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:19,243
Hip down! Get yourweight down!

1267
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:20,780
Get yourweight down!

1268
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:23,349
Well, Midnight is squeezing
with all his might. He's got itvery deep.

1269
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:25,976
-Ten seconds! Don't you tap!
-Ten seconds, Bryan, 10 seconds.

1270
01:25:26,153 --> 01:25:28,246
Don't tap! Brendan, don't you tap!

1271
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:29,812
Hold on, Brendan.

1272
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:31,391
Conlon doing his best to hang on,

1273
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:33,426
'cause his whole world's about to go
from dayto night.

1274
01:25:33,527 --> 01:25:35,757
Don't you tap! Don't you tap, Brendan!

1275
01:25:38,899 --> 01:25:41,060
I cannot believe that, Sam!

1276
01:25:41,168 --> 01:25:43,295
I thought for sure this guy
was going to sleep.

1277
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,931
Midnight can't believe it either, bythe way.

1278
01:25:48,909 --> 01:25:50,433
Jesus.

1279
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:55,847
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1280
01:25:55,983 --> 01:25:57,917
You should've had him in the first round.

1281
01:25:58,018 --> 01:25:59,815
You should've had him in the first round.

1282
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:04,082
Beautiful. Beautiful.
He doesn't knowwhat hit him.

1283
01:26:04,191 --> 01:26:05,988
He doesn't knowwhat hit him. Breathe.

1284
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:07,754
Deep breaths. Come on now.

1285
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:10,223
Small sip, small sip. Small sip.

1286
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,629
Deep breath, deep breath.
I want you to do something.

1287
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,429
I want you to get him to pull, okay?

1288
01:26:15,536 --> 01:26:18,266
When he pulls, I want you to hit him a bit
and I want you to shoot on him.

1289
01:26:18,372 --> 01:26:21,432
I'd love to be a fly on the wall,
listening to Frank Campana right now

1290
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:22,566
and hearwhat he's saying in there.

1291
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:24,303
In and out. In and out. In and out.

1292
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:27,381
And I want you to trade punches
with him, all right? You're doing beautiful.

1293
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:30,345
Let's go, seconds out!

1294
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:31,645
Knock him out. Knock him out.
Knock him out.

1295
01:26:31,752 --> 01:26:32,878
This round, knock him out.

1296
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:35,012
-Let's do it.
-He doesn't deserve to be here.

1297
01:26:35,122 --> 01:26:37,090
Beautiful. Breathe.

1298
01:26:37,191 --> 01:26:38,419
Let's go!

1299
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:44,158
And here we go. The teacher
answering the bell for round two.

1300
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:45,323
Nice and easy!

1301
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,391
Set the pace! Set the pace, Brendan!

1302
01:26:48,502 --> 01:26:50,470
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1303
01:27:06,353 --> 01:27:09,049
Circle around! Circle around!

1304
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:10,746
Nice and easy!

1305
01:27:11,959 --> 01:27:13,324
Good, good!

1306
01:27:13,427 --> 01:27:15,395
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1307
01:27:17,698 --> 01:27:22,067
Get out ofthere! Hitch him! Hitch him!
Hitch him!

1308
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,869
Get out ofthere!
Get out ofthere! Get out ofthere! Come on!

1309
01:27:28,175 --> 01:27:29,335
Do something.

1310
01:27:32,179 --> 01:27:33,237
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1311
01:27:33,914 --> 01:27:35,040
Shoot on him!

1312
01:27:37,818 --> 01:27:38,876
Yes!

1313
01:27:38,986 --> 01:27:41,045
Conlon shoots on Midnight Le
and gets him down.

1314
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:42,622
Midnight istrying to get to his...

1315
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:45,689
-Scissorstakedown.
-A beautiful scissors takedown.

1316
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:47,658
-Really nice.
-Conlon showing signs of life

1317
01:27:47,761 --> 01:27:49,524
and not backing down.

1318
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:50,790
Knees, knees!

1319
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:55,459
Good!

1320
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:57,628
Take his arm! Good!

1321
01:27:58,772 --> 01:28:01,639
-He's got a kimura lock!
-He's got avery good kimura.

1322
01:28:01,742 --> 01:28:05,007
Turn your hips in! In!

1323
01:28:05,145 --> 01:28:08,080
Up! Staywith him. Turn your hips in!

1324
01:28:10,017 --> 01:28:11,985
Hips up! Turn your hips in!

1325
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:13,314
Turn your hips in!

1326
01:28:13,854 --> 01:28:16,015
You got it, Brendan. Your round. You got it!

1327
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,283
Turn your hips up and in!

1328
01:28:18,659 --> 01:28:20,456
Hips up! Very good!

1329
01:28:21,061 --> 01:28:22,153
He's in a lot oftrouble.

1330
01:28:22,263 --> 01:28:24,060
That's it! Come on! Come on!

1331
01:28:24,164 --> 01:28:27,099
-Wow! He's got it very, very deep.
-Midnight is in avery, very bad position.

1332
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:28,259
Midnight is in big trouble.

1333
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:31,304
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1334
01:28:31,405 --> 01:28:33,032
Brendan Conlon is going
to finish it right here!

1335
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:34,937
Brendan Conlon has got
him in avery, very dangerous position

1336
01:28:35,042 --> 01:28:36,703
-and Midnight is in big trouble.
-Midnight...

1337
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:38,209
I don't think Midnight has anywhere to go.

1338
01:28:38,412 --> 01:28:40,403
You got it! You got it!

1339
01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:43,976
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1340
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:47,613
And this isn't... This isn't happening!

1341
01:28:47,721 --> 01:28:49,552
-This can't happen.
-lt just did, Bryan.

1342
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:50,824
He tapped!

1343
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:52,955
Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!

1344
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:55,528
-I can't believe that.
-Oh, my goodness!

1345
01:28:55,629 --> 01:28:58,291
You got him! Wayto go, Brendan!

1346
01:29:02,536 --> 01:29:04,629
Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.

1347
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,236
Honey, he tapped him out!

1348
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:09,467
He did it! He did it! He did it! He did it!

1349
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:12,171
Wayto go, Brendan! Wayto go! Yeah!

1350
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,080
This iswhat's so great
about mixed martial arts.

1351
01:29:15,182 --> 01:29:16,911
There's so manyways to lose.

1352
01:29:17,017 --> 01:29:21,317
One tiny miscalculation,
anyone can win at anytime.

1353
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,822
Which is probablywhy Frank Campana's
embracing his man.

1354
01:29:23,924 --> 01:29:28,691
And I honestly don't think either
one ofthem can believe what just happened.

1355
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:31,264
Great show of sportsmanship here
from the teacher.

1356
01:29:31,365 --> 01:29:33,993
Well, that's a hallmark
of Frank Campana's philosophy,

1357
01:29:34,101 --> 01:29:35,693
something all his fighters buy into,

1358
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,737
and, obviously, none more so than Brendan.

1359
01:29:37,871 --> 01:29:39,532
And Midnight Le is shocked.

1360
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,631
He thought he'd get a free pass
into the second round,

1361
01:29:41,742 --> 01:29:43,004
but, instead, he's going home.

1362
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:47,308
Dominated the fight the entire way,
but he falls preyto averytechnical finish.

1363
01:29:47,414 --> 01:29:49,439
Averytechnical finish, but that's a fluke.

1364
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,484
-I don't care what anybody says. That is a...
-I don't know.

1365
01:29:51,585 --> 01:29:54,383
You can call it a fluke, but I'm gonna call it
a guy maintaining composure

1366
01:29:54,488 --> 01:29:56,285
and waiting for his opportunity.

1367
01:29:57,324 --> 01:30:00,555
Conlon beats Midnight! Unbelievable!

1368
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:04,194
I hope you got a receipt foryour goldfish.

1369
01:30:27,154 --> 01:30:28,280
Yes!

1370
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:31,157
Okay.

1371
01:30:43,303 --> 01:30:45,294
We're down to eight fighters,
and soon to be seven,

1372
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:48,136
as Koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight.

1373
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:54,807
-Right hand.
-Huge right hand.

1374
01:30:54,915 --> 01:30:56,246
-Huge right hand.
-Oh, my goodness.

1375
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,676
Oh, my God! This is over.

1376
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:00,651
Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.

1377
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:03,615
You got to be kidding me. I'm afraid
he might have broken something else.

1378
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:05,089
That's certainly possible.

1379
01:31:05,225 --> 01:31:07,659
Koba moving on to tomorrow night.

1380
01:31:07,761 --> 01:31:09,695
-Koba! Koba!
-Koba! Koba!

1381
01:31:11,031 --> 01:31:13,465
Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed.

1382
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,295
Like a man with something to prove,

1383
01:31:15,402 --> 01:31:19,395
reminding everyone why he is a
serious contender to win this whole contest.

1384
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,736
He wanted to send a message to
Tommy Riordan, and there it is, right there.

1385
01:31:24,344 --> 01:31:26,471
Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.

1386
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:28,980
The teacher miraculously
passed his first test,

1387
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,573
but now he's got to face The Dane.

1388
01:31:30,684 --> 01:31:33,175
Brendan! You can do it.

1389
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:38,787
Halfwaythrough round three, now,
and the beating continues.

1390
01:31:38,892 --> 01:31:42,919
I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon
can take this kind of punishment.

1391
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,930
He has been battered without mercy

1392
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:46,465
-in both of his fights today.
-Relax! You're okay!

1393
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,194
He's still standing, Bryan.

1394
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:51,398
Beethoven!

1395
01:31:51,505 --> 01:31:53,029
No! No, no, no!

1396
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:56,337
Good, take him down!

1397
01:31:57,745 --> 01:31:59,337
Look at this, he's taking The Dane down!

1398
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,469
Hold on to him.

1399
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:03,179
He's looking forthat arm.
He's looking forthe armbar.

1400
01:32:03,283 --> 01:32:05,114
-He's got an armbar.
-He's got that armbar.

1401
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:06,982
He's looking to be boss of it, once again.

1402
01:32:07,087 --> 01:32:08,611
Tap, tap, tap! Come on, tap, tap, tap!

1403
01:32:09,556 --> 01:32:11,956
Palms flat! Palms flat! Thumbs up!

1404
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,124
He's got that arm, Sam!

1405
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:16,694
-Break, break, break, break!
-Yes!

1406
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:17,821
Are you kidding me?

1407
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:19,723
Yes!

1408
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:22,165
Do it once, it's a fluke.
Do it twice, and it's something else.

1409
01:32:22,269 --> 01:32:25,534
Pull the bandwagon over,
I think I am hopping on.

1410
01:32:25,906 --> 01:32:27,203
I think I'm a believer.

1411
01:32:27,674 --> 01:32:30,108
You did it! Wayto go, Brendan!

1412
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:31,834
-I'm doing this!
-Okay.

1413
01:32:31,945 --> 01:32:33,139
-I'm doing it!
-Okay.

1414
01:32:33,247 --> 01:32:34,407
Okay, Son.

1415
01:32:35,115 --> 01:32:38,084
The crowd catching fire
forthe hero Tommy Riordan.

1416
01:32:39,686 --> 01:32:41,415
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1417
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:44,116
He doesn't seem to want
anything to do with all this adulation.

1418
01:32:44,224 --> 01:32:45,919
He's just here to fight.

1419
01:32:46,026 --> 01:32:48,460
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1420
01:32:48,562 --> 01:32:49,961
Gentlemen, you ready?

1421
01:32:50,931 --> 01:32:52,057
Are you ready?

1422
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:54,361
-Let's go to war!
-Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!

1423
01:32:55,435 --> 01:32:57,562
Well, here he comes again like a buzz saw!

1424
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:03,405
-Yeah.
-He is all over Diego Santana.

1425
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:08,680
He's swarming all over him,
and now he's beating on him without mercy!

1426
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:09,783
Oh, my goodness!

1427
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:21,486
There he goes again,
storming out ofthe cage!

1428
01:33:21,595 --> 01:33:24,393
Tommy Riordan marching off
through the crowd

1429
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:28,161
and straight into the final four,
ladies and gentlemen.

1430
01:33:28,268 --> 01:33:30,862
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1431
01:33:57,598 --> 01:33:59,759
-So where is he?
-Yeah. Mr. Conlon.

1432
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,092
Make a right at that white sign...

1433
01:34:11,645 --> 01:34:14,375
Hey! Can't sleep, huh?

1434
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:24,922
I knowthat that otherthing is

1435
01:34:27,394 --> 01:34:29,954
bothering the hell out ofyou.

1436
01:34:31,398 --> 01:34:33,525
I'm proud ofyou, Tommy.

1437
01:34:34,501 --> 01:34:37,129
What you did forthat kid in thetank,

1438
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:39,896
thatwas really something.

1439
01:34:43,076 --> 01:34:45,169
How about deserting my unit?

1440
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:48,908
Is that really something, too?

1441
01:34:52,085 --> 01:34:53,313
Yeah.

1442
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:58,114
I was on myway out ofthe country
when I came across those guys.

1443
01:34:58,992 --> 01:35:00,755
What was I supposed to do?
Let them drown?

1444
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:01,953
No.

1445
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:07,530
-What did you do?
-What did I do?

1446
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:11,736
I took off.

1447
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:17,504
That's why you go by Riordan.

1448
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:21,939
That's why they can't
find your service records.

1449
01:35:25,285 --> 01:35:28,049
What the hell happened over there, Tommy?

1450
01:35:29,289 --> 01:35:31,120
That is none ofyour business, man.

1451
01:35:31,224 --> 01:35:34,022
Come on, kiddo. You know, I've been there.

1452
01:35:34,127 --> 01:35:36,561
I've done it, I've seen it.

1453
01:35:36,663 --> 01:35:38,221
You can trust me. I understand.

1454
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:41,358
Will you spare me the
compassionate father routine, Pop?

1455
01:35:42,669 --> 01:35:44,466
The suit don't fit.

1456
01:35:45,339 --> 01:35:46,499
Tommy.

1457
01:35:47,441 --> 01:35:49,432
I'm reallytrying here.

1458
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:53,038
-You're trying?
-Yeah, really. I'm trying.

1459
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:54,272
Now?

1460
01:35:56,984 --> 01:35:59,282
Where were you when it mattered?

1461
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:04,356
I needed this guy backwhen I was a kid.
I don't need you now.

1462
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:08,492
You know, it's too late now.
Everything's already happened.

1463
01:36:09,529 --> 01:36:12,589
You and Brendan
don't seem to understand that.

1464
01:36:13,333 --> 01:36:16,234
Let me explain something to you, okay?

1465
01:36:16,336 --> 01:36:19,601
The onlything that I have in common
with Brendan Conlon

1466
01:36:19,706 --> 01:36:21,571
is that the pair of us,

1467
01:36:22,776 --> 01:36:25,438
we have absolutely no use foryou.

1468
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:31,348
Look at you.

1469
01:36:32,652 --> 01:36:35,143
Yeah, I was right.

1470
01:36:35,922 --> 01:36:37,947
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

1471
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:40,185
At least you had some balls then,
not like now,

1472
01:36:40,293 --> 01:36:44,423
tiptoeing around,
like some beggarwith your cup out.

1473
01:36:47,267 --> 01:36:49,428
Take it somewhere else.
In fact, you knowwhat?

1474
01:36:49,536 --> 01:36:50,560
Here's a cup.

1475
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:54,037
Why don't you take this and go get yourself
some more ofyour shittytapes...

1476
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,972
-Don't do this, Tommy.
-...and you go backto the room

1477
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:57,737
-and you listen to some more...
-Don't do this.

1478
01:36:57,844 --> 01:37:01,302
...fish stories that no one gives a shit about.
Now get out of here.

1479
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,381
Get the fuck out of here! Go on.

1480
01:37:44,724 --> 01:37:46,214
God pitythem!

1481
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:49,328
All shall perish except me!

1482
01:37:53,366 --> 01:37:56,858
Bastards. Bastards!

1483
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:01,107
You bastards. You bastards!

1484
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:04,738
Stop the ship, you bastards!

1485
01:38:04,845 --> 01:38:07,143
Ishmael. God pity them.

1486
01:38:07,881 --> 01:38:11,248
Stop the ship. Please, stop the ship.

1487
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,045
Stop the ship! Somebody.

1488
01:38:17,524 --> 01:38:18,821
Ahab.

1489
01:38:19,559 --> 01:38:21,993
You godless son of a bitch!

1490
01:38:22,095 --> 01:38:23,960
You stop the ship!

1491
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:27,158
You godless son of a bitch!

1492
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:31,237
"'The whale! The ship!'
cried the cringing oarsmen.

1493
01:38:31,338 --> 01:38:33,329
"'Oars! Oars! Slope downward..."'

1494
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,600
Stop it.

1495
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:37,366
"'O sea that ere it be for ever too late,

1496
01:38:37,477 --> 01:38:40,878
"'Ahab may slide this last,
last time upon his mark!"'

1497
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:44,081
Captain...

1498
01:38:45,318 --> 01:38:47,218
Stop the...

1499
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,618
Captain, stop...

1500
01:38:49,723 --> 01:38:51,987
Stop the ship, Ahab.

1501
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,528
For the love of God.

1502
01:38:56,663 --> 01:38:58,221
They're lost.

1503
01:38:59,299 --> 01:39:01,199
Stop it... The ship.

1504
01:39:05,205 --> 01:39:06,399
Ahab...

1505
01:39:09,609 --> 01:39:11,167
You stop the...

1506
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:17,139
Oh, no.

1507
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:23,680
-Come on, give me the Walkman.
-No.

1508
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:25,951
-No, no.
-Come on.

1509
01:39:26,059 --> 01:39:27,924
Come on, come on.
Come, give me the bottle.

1510
01:39:28,028 --> 01:39:29,996
Come here, come here, come here.

1511
01:39:30,096 --> 01:39:32,360
-Come on. Give me.
-No.

1512
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:44,006
Tommy.

1513
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:46,706
We're lost.

1514
01:39:48,515 --> 01:39:50,210
We're lost, Tommy.

1515
01:39:51,952 --> 01:39:55,012
It's over. We'll never make it back.

1516
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:59,619
-Stay down.
-We'll never make it back.

1517
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:11,798
I'm here.

1518
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:19,273
I always loved you.

1519
01:40:21,481 --> 01:40:23,813
You knowthat, don't you, Tommy?

1520
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:26,381
I always loved you.

1521
01:40:27,954 --> 01:40:31,321
You and your brother. Mytwo boys.

1522
01:40:46,873 --> 01:40:50,104
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1523
01:41:03,723 --> 01:41:07,250
Tommy Riordan coming down the tunnel
without his trainer.

1524
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:14,460
Once again, no walk-out music.

1525
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:20,172
I'd hardly say no music, Sam.

1526
01:41:25,045 --> 01:41:28,208
Bryan, it sounds like V-J day
in Times Square.

1527
01:41:28,315 --> 01:41:30,283
I've never seen anything like this.

1528
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,296
Tommy acknowledging his comrades
forthe first time

1529
01:41:50,403 --> 01:41:52,496
and climbing into the cage.

1530
01:41:57,243 --> 01:41:59,438
Mad Dog Grimes has been
waiting for revenge

1531
01:41:59,546 --> 01:42:02,242
ever since the day Tommy Riordan
walked into his gym in Pittsburgh

1532
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:04,180
and turned his life upside down.

1533
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:07,947
It's been avery long and very miserable
few months for Mad Dog, to saythe least.

1534
01:42:09,522 --> 01:42:13,959
Grimes mocking Riordan by having
a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,

1535
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:17,325
and the Marines are really
letting Mad Dog have it.

1536
01:42:20,967 --> 01:42:22,366
All right, gentlemen.

1537
01:42:27,073 --> 01:42:28,597
All right, gentlemen,
we've been overyour instructions.

1538
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:29,970
I expect a clean fight.

1539
01:42:30,076 --> 01:42:33,011
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1540
01:42:33,113 --> 01:42:34,944
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1541
01:42:35,048 --> 01:42:36,879
It's not gonna happen again.

1542
01:42:38,451 --> 01:42:42,046
Mad Dog chomping at the bit here.
He can't wait to get a piece ofTommy.

1543
01:42:42,155 --> 01:42:43,554
He predicted an early knockout.

1544
01:42:43,656 --> 01:42:46,318
He said he was gonna
take Tommy out with one punch.

1545
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:48,951
And bythe way, he said,
"They're gonna have to pull me off him."

1546
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:51,929
We'll see what Tommy has to say about that.

1547
01:42:53,466 --> 01:42:54,933
Gentlemen, you ready?

1548
01:42:55,568 --> 01:42:56,728
You ready?

1549
01:42:58,705 --> 01:43:00,866
-Let's go to war!
-Here they go and they are off!

1550
01:43:02,475 --> 01:43:04,875
Tommytackles him, and he's on top!

1551
01:43:04,978 --> 01:43:06,570
He's raining bombs!

1552
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:09,073
-Cover up!
-Come on, work it.

1553
01:43:10,216 --> 01:43:11,808
-Raining bombs.
-Mad Dog is out.

1554
01:43:11,918 --> 01:43:14,011
Mad Dog's in trouble. Please stop this.

1555
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:15,610
Stop it! Stop the fight!

1556
01:43:17,657 --> 01:43:19,648
Break! Break! Break!

1557
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:24,192
That's the fastest knockout I think
I've ever experienced!

1558
01:43:24,297 --> 01:43:27,733
Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
He is not moving.

1559
01:43:29,569 --> 01:43:33,266
You do that to someone on the street,
they lockyou up and throw awaythe key.

1560
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:34,931
Break out the yellowtape, Sam.

1561
01:43:35,041 --> 01:43:37,771
This guy's walking away from the cage
like he's leaving a crime scene!

1562
01:43:37,877 --> 01:43:41,005
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1563
01:43:46,786 --> 01:43:49,653
-Everybodythrough. Come on, move it out.
-Sparta!

1564
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,563
Yeah!

1565
01:44:04,604 --> 01:44:06,071
Mr. C! Mr. C!

1566
01:44:06,172 --> 01:44:07,571
I'm on your side.

1567
01:44:16,683 --> 01:44:18,150
Let's go.

1568
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:21,283
-Principal Zito, there he is.
-Nice.

1569
01:44:25,358 --> 01:44:27,019
Let's go, Brendan.

1570
01:44:30,363 --> 01:44:33,992
Brendan Conlon came into this tournament
as 1,000-to-one underdog,

1571
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:36,295
and now here he is in the final four.

1572
01:44:36,402 --> 01:44:39,963
The crowd showing their appreciation.
He's getting quite the reception.

1573
01:44:40,073 --> 01:44:43,941
He's got a huge reception.
I mean, this guy shocked everybody.

1574
01:44:45,245 --> 01:44:47,145
Come on, come on. You all right?

1575
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:51,413
You've got avisitor.

1576
01:44:53,653 --> 01:44:55,587
Second row, 10 o'clock.

1577
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:05,291
You all right with that?

1578
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:11,259
I love you.

1579
01:45:14,774 --> 01:45:16,935
And here comes the great Russian, Koba.

1580
01:45:17,043 --> 01:45:20,740
Koba is so intimidating
and his reputation is largerthan life.

1581
01:45:20,847 --> 01:45:24,078
-Koba! Koba!
-Koba! Koba!

1582
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:32,825
I want you to look right at him
when he comes in here. Look right at him.

1583
01:45:32,926 --> 01:45:35,622
All right? Don't take your eyes off him.

1584
01:46:03,122 --> 01:46:05,147
I'm proud ofyou, brother.

1585
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:07,487
This is your cage.

1586
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:20,704
Gentlemen.

1587
01:46:28,648 --> 01:46:30,172
All right, gentlemen,
we've been overyour instructions.

1588
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:31,716
I expect a clean fight.

1589
01:46:31,818 --> 01:46:34,582
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1590
01:46:34,687 --> 01:46:37,178
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1591
01:46:41,094 --> 01:46:43,722
Should I be nervous for Brendan?
'Cause I am.

1592
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:45,991
I wanna stop the fight
before it even gets going.

1593
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:49,159
-Well, here we go.
-He's like a machine. Look at him.

1594
01:46:51,871 --> 01:46:53,463
Gentlemen, you ready?

1595
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:55,701
You ready? Let's go to war!

1596
01:46:55,808 --> 01:46:57,298
Keep your hands up, Brendan. Hands up.

1597
01:46:57,410 --> 01:47:01,278
But now, the question is, how long
can Brendan Conlon stay alive?

1598
01:47:01,547 --> 01:47:02,639
Angle out of it!

1599
01:47:04,717 --> 01:47:06,184
Keep moving!

1600
01:47:07,787 --> 01:47:10,255
Get out ofthere! Get out ofthere!

1601
01:47:14,527 --> 01:47:16,757
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Get away from him!

1602
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:18,558
Hit him, babe! Hit him! Get in there!

1603
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:22,692
-Crushing body shots.
-Relax, you're okay.

1604
01:47:22,802 --> 01:47:24,702
Conlon's down,
and Koba pounces and starts pounding!

1605
01:47:24,804 --> 01:47:26,169
Get up! Get up!

1606
01:47:26,272 --> 01:47:28,206
He's just pounding on him
like a side of beef.

1607
01:47:28,474 --> 01:47:29,805
Go, go, go. Get up!

1608
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:31,799
He's getting his ass whooped.

1609
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:36,148
And now he's got him in the air!

1610
01:47:36,249 --> 01:47:37,876
Oh, God.

1611
01:47:37,984 --> 01:47:40,214
Relax, tie up his arm! Tie him up!

1612
01:47:43,923 --> 01:47:46,221
I think Campana has to think
seriously about...

1613
01:47:46,325 --> 01:47:48,657
-How much abuse can one man take?
-...continuing another round ofthis.

1614
01:47:48,761 --> 01:47:49,819
Go to war!

1615
01:47:53,733 --> 01:47:57,362
Just relax! Relax! Relax! Offthe fence!

1616
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:01,698
Brendan's going for a ride!

1617
01:48:01,841 --> 01:48:04,401
That one shookthe entire building!

1618
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:08,445
Man, he just threw him against the fence
like a rag doll.

1619
01:48:08,548 --> 01:48:12,314
Get up! Get up! Come on!
Hold on! Turn it in! Turn in!

1620
01:48:12,418 --> 01:48:14,113
And now he's on top! Koba's on top,

1621
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:17,189
and he's finishing him, here. Look at this.
On the edge of blowing it.

1622
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:19,155
Get offthe fence, Brendan!

1623
01:48:19,258 --> 01:48:21,920
You wonder how Conlon can
take this kind of beating on his arms.

1624
01:48:22,028 --> 01:48:25,088
-His forearms and his hands.
-Drop that neck!

1625
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:26,665
How much can one man take?

1626
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,033
Break! Break! Break!

1627
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:33,565
Everybody has got to be
a little bit concerned

1628
01:48:33,673 --> 01:48:36,403
about Brendan Conlon's bravery
getting him in trouble here.

1629
01:48:36,509 --> 01:48:38,443
His bravery could get him killed, frankly.

1630
01:48:38,544 --> 01:48:40,671
And bythe way,
he's got nothing more to prove.

1631
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,577
-He's lasted two rounds with Koba.
-That's true, that's true.

1632
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:44,775
And you wonderwhat's keeping this guy up.

1633
01:48:45,918 --> 01:48:47,818
Sit down. Sit down.

1634
01:48:48,955 --> 01:48:50,547
Breathe. Breathe!

1635
01:48:51,324 --> 01:48:53,417
Look at me. Look at me!

1636
01:48:53,526 --> 01:48:56,757
Wait up. Small sips. Hold it.
Hold it, small sips.

1637
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:02,232
Why are we here?
Why are we here, Brendan?

1638
01:49:02,335 --> 01:49:03,768
Why are we here?
Are we here to win this fight?

1639
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:05,098
Are we here to win this fight?

1640
01:49:05,204 --> 01:49:07,832
You tell me.
'Cause ifwe're not, I will throw in the towel.

1641
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,908
We will get Tess and we will go home.

1642
01:49:10,009 --> 01:49:11,943
We'll go home, okay?

1643
01:49:12,745 --> 01:49:14,940
You don't knock him out, you lose the fight.

1644
01:49:15,248 --> 01:49:17,011
Do you understand me?

1645
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:20,843
You don't knock him out,
you don't have a home.

1646
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:23,288
Let's go! Seconds out! Seconds out!

1647
01:49:42,542 --> 01:49:44,840
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1648
01:49:49,148 --> 01:49:52,549
Conlon somehow
answering the call to round three.

1649
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:55,052
And Koba's all over him once again.

1650
01:49:58,157 --> 01:49:59,351
Brendan's giving back, Bryan.

1651
01:49:59,458 --> 01:50:01,255
I mean, there's signs of life
in Brendan Conlon.

1652
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:03,657
He's starting to mix it up.

1653
01:50:11,838 --> 01:50:13,169
Pummel, pummel, pummel.

1654
01:50:16,008 --> 01:50:18,374
He's taking Koba down,
but the Russian's back up.

1655
01:50:19,178 --> 01:50:20,975
Brendan shoots him again,
pressing him against the cage.

1656
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:23,810
-Yes!
-Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.

1657
01:50:23,916 --> 01:50:25,747
Well, Conlon trapped in an iron vice here,

1658
01:50:25,852 --> 01:50:27,820
and Koba now squeezing his neck
for all it's worth,

1659
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:28,887
trying to choke the teacher out.

1660
01:50:28,988 --> 01:50:31,821
Hips, hips, hips! Breathe! Breathe!

1661
01:50:31,924 --> 01:50:33,892
Ride it out! Ride it out!

1662
01:50:34,827 --> 01:50:36,488
Conlon looking for away out.

1663
01:50:36,596 --> 01:50:39,394
-What is this?
-Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?

1664
01:50:39,498 --> 01:50:42,160
He just shook off a guillotine
and tossed Koba.

1665
01:50:42,268 --> 01:50:44,429
Conlon's looking for an armbar.
He's looking forthat armbar,

1666
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:47,062
-and he's trying to submit the Russian bear.
-Hips, hips, hips!

1667
01:50:47,173 --> 01:50:48,504
Yeah, you got him!
You got him! You got him!

1668
01:50:49,175 --> 01:50:50,938
Koba slips right out.

1669
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:54,377
Conlon's staying after him.
He's squeezing the bear.

1670
01:50:54,747 --> 01:50:58,205
The tables have turned and the boy scout
is actually messing with the bear.

1671
01:50:58,317 --> 01:51:00,410
The teacher springing offthe fence and
going for a mountain,

1672
01:51:00,519 --> 01:51:01,508
-but Koba's on his feet.
-Get up, get up!

1673
01:51:01,621 --> 01:51:03,088
He does not want to be
on the ground with Brendan

1674
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:05,157
and his endless bag of submissions.

1675
01:51:05,258 --> 01:51:08,694
Kobatrying to reestablish his dominance
with brutal shots to the face.

1676
01:51:08,794 --> 01:51:11,661
But Conlon's showing no fear.
This is a fight!

1677
01:51:11,764 --> 01:51:13,994
We have got ourselves a fight!

1678
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:20,000
Wow, that's a huge elbowto the head.

1679
01:51:20,106 --> 01:51:22,370
And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar.
He's got it very deep!

1680
01:51:22,475 --> 01:51:24,443
He's got it very, very deep!

1681
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:25,834
He's deep on that.

1682
01:51:26,612 --> 01:51:28,011
He's got Koba in a lot of pain.

1683
01:51:28,114 --> 01:51:29,911
We sawthis with Midnight,
we saw it against The Dane,

1684
01:51:30,016 --> 01:51:31,677
and we're seeing it here! Brendan Conlon...

1685
01:51:32,051 --> 01:51:34,542
Break it! Break it! Break it!

1686
01:51:35,288 --> 01:51:36,687
Not letting out!

1687
01:51:36,789 --> 01:51:38,848
Conlon wrenching that knee
for all it's worth.

1688
01:51:38,958 --> 01:51:40,687
He's putting everything he has into it.

1689
01:51:42,228 --> 01:51:44,526
And Koba is screaming in pain.

1690
01:51:44,630 --> 01:51:45,619
Kobataps.

1691
01:51:45,731 --> 01:51:48,131
Koba has tapped!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1692
01:51:48,234 --> 01:51:52,000
I can't believe it!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1693
01:51:52,104 --> 01:51:54,664
He's tapped Koba!

1694
01:51:54,774 --> 01:51:57,504
And Frank Campana can't believe it.

1695
01:51:57,610 --> 01:52:00,135
This whole place can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

1696
01:52:00,246 --> 01:52:03,409
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba.

1697
01:52:04,116 --> 01:52:07,643

01:52:12,825 --> 01:52:15,555
-I don't knowwhat to say. It's amazing!
-I don't knowwhat I just saw.

1701
01:52:15,661 --> 01:52:17,822
I just don't know
howto put this into context.

1702
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:20,728
That's gotta be the biggest upset
in MMA history.

1703
01:52:20,833 --> 01:52:22,926
I have never seen anything like this.

1704
01:52:23,035 --> 01:52:26,436
He tapped aworld Sambo champion
in a knee bar!

1705
01:52:28,307 --> 01:52:31,572
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba!

1706
01:52:31,677 --> 01:52:35,477
Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!
Brendan Conlon, the civilian!

1707
01:52:35,748 --> 01:52:37,739
He's done the impossible.

1708
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:41,286
He has done the impossible.
He's pulled off a miracle.

1709
01:52:41,687 --> 01:52:45,487
This place is going crazy
because they've just seen a miracle.

1710
01:52:57,336 --> 01:52:59,804
This is CNN Breaking News.

1711
01:53:00,539 --> 01:53:04,305
A surprising turn in the story
of Iraq War hero, Tommy Riordan.

1712
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:07,879
CNN has learned that Riordan's true identity

1713
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:10,813
is that of Marine Staff Sergeant
Thomas Conlon,

1714
01:53:10,916 --> 01:53:13,749
who went AWOL from his unit
earlier this year,

1715
01:53:13,853 --> 01:53:16,720
following the friendly fire death
of his brother-in-arms,

1716
01:53:16,822 --> 01:53:18,153
Sergeant Manny Fernandez.

1717
01:53:18,524 --> 01:53:21,391
Fernandez's wife, Pilar Fernandez,
spoke with me

1718
01:53:21,494 --> 01:53:24,088
in an exclusive interview, moments ago.

1719
01:53:24,764 --> 01:53:26,664
The bombs started dropping.

1720
01:53:27,466 --> 01:53:30,299
They were coming from US planes.

1721
01:53:30,403 --> 01:53:34,203
Tommy and Manny were waving their flags

1722
01:53:35,207 --> 01:53:37,641
to let them know they were Americans,

1723
01:53:37,743 --> 01:53:39,335
but they didn't stop.

1724
01:53:40,913 --> 01:53:42,403
Everyone died.

1725
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:45,014
Everyone except Tommy.

1726
01:53:45,885 --> 01:53:49,321
And, you know, my Manny used to say,

1727
01:53:52,124 --> 01:53:54,592
that Tommy was the brother he never had.

1728
01:53:55,294 --> 01:53:59,230
Conlon, who is fighting in the mixed
martial arts mega tournament, Sparta,

1729
01:53:59,331 --> 01:54:02,698
is expected to be taken into custody
by military police,

1730
01:54:02,802 --> 01:54:05,896
following tonight's winner-take-all finale
in Atlantic City.

1731
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:10,339
If victorious, he has pledged
his $5 million purse

1732
01:54:10,443 --> 01:54:12,308
to the widow of his fallen comrade.

1733
01:54:14,046 --> 01:54:16,014
We've just got some incredible news,

1734
01:54:16,115 --> 01:54:18,743
that I'm having trouble
putting into context, but here it is.

1735
01:54:19,151 --> 01:54:23,019
The two men
fighting for the championship tonight,

1736
01:54:23,122 --> 01:54:25,283

1737
01:54:25,424 --> 01:54:28,860
for the middleweight championship
of the world,

1738
01:54:28,961 --> 01:54:30,428
are brothers.

1739
01:54:56,655 --> 01:54:58,885
All right, let's get this off.

1740
01:55:16,142 --> 01:55:17,973
What are you gonna do?

1741
01:55:22,915 --> 01:55:24,610
I'm gonna fight him.

1742
01:56:35,487 --> 01:56:38,923
-Mr. C, Mr. C!
-Mr. C, Mr. C!

1743
01:57:24,703 --> 01:57:27,831
-Tommy! Tommy!
-Tommy! Tommy!

1744
01:58:26,198 --> 01:58:27,529
Gentlemen.

1745

Gentlemen, this is the final.
I expect a clean fight.

1746

Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1747
01:58:40,045 --> 01:58:41,842
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1748
01:58:41,947 --> 01:58:43,312
Where's Pop?

1749
01:59:03,769 --> 01:59:05,737
Gentlemen, are you ready?

1750
01:59:07,005 --> 01:59:08,370
Are you ready?

1751
01:59:09,775 --> 01:59:10,867
Let's go to war!

1752
01:59:22,988 --> 01:59:24,922
Relax, Brendan, relax!

1767
02:00:11,737 --> 02:00:13,102
Hey, come on, Josh!

1768
02:00:13,405 --> 02:00:14,429
What's up with that?

1769
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,535
Hey, step back!

1770
02:00:16,642 --> 02:00:18,166
Watch that late blow!

1771

1772
02:00:28,353 --> 02:00:30,218
Come on, Josh! I mean, what is that?

1773
02:00:30,322 --> 02:00:32,483
Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

1774

Sit... Brendan, sit down.

1778
02:00:45,037 --> 02:00:47,528
Breathe. Beethoven.

1779
02:00:48,173 --> 02:00:51,540
Okay. He's coming right at you, right?
Exactly like we planned.

1780
02:00:51,643 --> 02:00:54,737
I want you to angle out,
hit and move every time. All right?

1781
02:00:54,847 --> 02:00:56,144
-Angle out and move.

-All right.
-He's in the way.

1786
02:01:06,825 --> 02:01:09,157
Seconds out. Wrap it up.

1787
02:01:09,261 --> 02:01:11,627
Taking a little more time forthe cheap shot.

1788

All right, you got two rounds. Two rounds.

1836
02:04:29,127 --> 02:04:30,355
We need both rounds.

1837
02:04:33,165 --> 02:04:34,223

1840
02:04:54,686 --> 02:04:57,018
Tommy, what are you doing?

1841
02:04:57,823 --> 02:04:59,415
Shut up. Come on.

1842
02:05:00,392 --> 02:05:01,825
Stand back.

1843
02:05:02,594 --> 02:05:05,688
Come on. What? Have you gone crazy?

1844

What are you doing? What are you doing?

1848
02:05:19,978 --> 02:05:21,605
It's over, Tommy.

It's over, Tommy. Come on.

1851
02:05:40,031 --> 02:05:42,363
Tommy, we don't have to do this.

1852
02:05:54,212 --> 02:05:56,737
Come on.
Why do you want to do this, Tommy?

1853
02:05:57,115 --> 02:05:58,412
Am I gonna have to watch you do this?

1854
02:06:06,124 --> 02:06:08,354
Okay? You all right there?

1855
02:06:09,161 --> 02:06:10,492
Tommy!

1856
02:06:20,939 --> 02:06:23,407
Quick, finish him! You finish him!

1857
02:06:30,115 --> 02:06:31,446
Come on.

1858
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:45,195
Break, break, break! Back up, back up!

1859
02:08:42,747 --> 02:08:46,308
I'm sorry, Tommy. I'm sorry.

1860
02:08:49,554 --> 02:08:51,488
Tap, Tommy.

1861
02:08:52,157 --> 02:08:54,591
It's okay. It's okay.

1862
02:09:04,602 --> 02:09:06,092
I love you.

1863
02:09:07,339 --> 02:09:08,806
I love you, Tommy.
