1
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,285
She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.

2
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,333
l let her hear my footsteps.

3
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,005
She only goes stiff for a moment.

4
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,175
Care for a smoke?

5
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,263
Sure. I'II take one.

6
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,850
Are you as bored
by that crowd as I am?

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:05,314
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,735
I've watched you for days.

9
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,364
You're everything
a man couId ever want.

10
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,658
It's not just your face.

11
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,039
your figure. or your voice.

12
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,877
It's your eyes.

13
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,048
AII the things I see in your eyes.

14
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,345
What is it you see in my eyes?

15
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,060
I see a crazy caIm.

16
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,189
You're sick of running.

17
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,402
You're ready to face
what you have to face.

18
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,697
But you don't want to face it aIone.

19
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,075
No.

20
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,286
I don't want to face it aIone.

21
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,380
The wind rises electric.

22
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,050
She's soff and warm
and almost weightless.

23
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,513
Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.

24
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,600
l tell her that everything
will be all right.

25
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:30,274
That l'll save her from whatever she's
scared of and take her far, far away.

26
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,363
l tell her l love her.

27
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,453
The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.

28
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,458
l hold her close until she's gone.

29
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,797
l'll never know
what she was running from.

30
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,969
l'll cash her check in the morning.

31
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,336
Just one hour to go.
My last day on the job.

32
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,339
Early retirement. Not my idea.

33
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,259
Doctor's orders. Heart condition .

34
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,095
"Angina" , he calls it.

35
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,015
l'm polishing my badge
and getting myself used

36
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,599
to the idea of saying good-bye to it.

37
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,186
lt, and the 30-odd years
of protecting and serving and tears

38
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:18,108
and the blood and terror
and triumph it represents.

39
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,069
l'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.

40
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,990
About the thick. fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher's today.

41
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,453
And l'm thinking about
the one loose end l haven't tied up.

42
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,955
A young girl
who's out there somewhere.

43
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,791
helpless in the hands
of a drooling lunatic.

44
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,757
Damn it. Hartigan.
I won't Iet you do this.

45
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,467
You're gonna get yourseIf kiIIed.

46
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,970
You're gonna get us both kiIIed.
I won't Iet you. I'm warning you.

47
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,722
Let go of my coat. Bob.

48
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,224
You're dragging me down with you.

49
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,436
I'm your partner. They can kiII me. too.

50
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,229
I ain't putting up with that.

51
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,939
I'm getting on the horn
and caIIing for backup.

52
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,317
Sure. Bob. We'II just wait.

53
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,444
Sit on our hands whiIe that Roark brat

54
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,780
gets his sick thriIIs
with victim number four.

55
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,823
Victim number four.

56
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,159
Nancy CaIIahan. age 11.

57
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,995
And she'II be raped
and sIashed to ribbons.

58
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,707
And that backup that we're waiting on
wiII just so happen to show up

59
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,878
just Iate enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

60
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,506
Take a deep breath. Hartigan.

61
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,883
SettIe down and think straight.

62
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,137
You're pushing 60
and you got a bum ticker.

63
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,015
You ain't saving anyone.

64
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,852
You got a great attitude. Bob.

65
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,064
ReaI credit to the force. you are.

66
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:43,193
EiIeen's at home waiting for you.
Think about EiIeen.

67
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,739
Heck. Bob.

68
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,160
maybe you are right.

69
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,955
I'm gIad to hear
you're finaIIy taIking sense.

70
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,917
Hell of a way to end a partnership.

71
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,461
Hell of a way to start my retirement.

72
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,506
Nancy Callahan, age 11.

73
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,092
For all l know, she's dead already.

74
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,222
You've been a very good girI. Nancy.

75
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,640
You've been very quiet.

76
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,144
Don't be scared.

77
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,438
We're gonna be
taking you home reaIIy soon.

78
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,900
But first. we're going
to introduce you to somebody.

79
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,945
He's a very nice man.

80
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,574
Halfway to the warehouse where

81
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,951
we evil said they took her, and it hits.

82
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,370
wicked spot of indigestion .

83
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,581
At least that's what l pray it is.

84
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,378
The briefest induIge-ment
in automotive pIeasure.

85
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:47,757
For cheap thriIIs.
Such short-Iived durabiIity. Mr. ShIubb.

86
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,095
You wouId risk engender-ating iII wiII
on the part of our empIoyers.

87
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,264
Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump,

88
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:58,435
two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs
with delusions of eloquence.

89
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,646
This Jaguar you so pin-headedIy covet.

90
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,316
temporariIy remanded
to our custody though it may be.

91
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,611
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

92
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,989
Gotta keep this quiet.
Take them down fast.

93
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,283
A singIe dent.
the merest scratch thereupon.

94
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,618
and the before
mentioned consequences

95
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:19,247
of which I so recentIy made mention
shaII sureIy be athwart us.

96
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,635
Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.

97
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,429
But it won't slow down.

98
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,141
Get over it.

99
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,977
She needs you.

100
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,479
We're aII done here. Benny.

101
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,982
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

102
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,026
Be with you in a minute. Lenny.

103
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,820
I'm just making sure
they get aIong reaIIy weII.

104
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,531
And what kind of beast
couIdn't get aIong

105
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,659
with a precious IittIe girI Iike this?

106
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,787
You must be awfuIIy scared now.

107
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,457
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

108
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,295
AII we're gonna do
is have a nice IittIe taIk.

109
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,217
That's aII. Just a nice taIk.
Just you and me.

110
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,470
Don't you cry now.

111
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,682
Doctor said it'd be like this.

112
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,017
Just take the pill he gave you .

113
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,653
No need to play it quiet.

114
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,697
Not any more.

115
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,369
Breathe steady, old man .
Prove you're not completely useless.

116
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,289
what the hell? Go out with a bang.

117
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,207
He likes to hear them scream.

118
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,876
l've seen his victims
and their twisted little faces.

119
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,878
all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed,

120
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,381
frozen in their last
horrible moment of living.

121
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,425
No screams.

122
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,511
Either l'm just in time,
or l'm way too late.

123
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:11,776
lt's nothing. Barely a flesh wound.
On your feet, old man.

124
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,951
Roark. Give it up.

125
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,078
Let the girI go.

126
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,998
You can't do
a goddamn thing to me. Hartigan.

127
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,833
You know who I am.

128
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,710
You know who my father is.

129
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,588
You can't touch me.
you piece of shit cop.

130
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,968
Look at you. You can't even Iift
that cannon you're carrying.

131
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,221
Sure. I can.

132
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,649
Cover your eyes. Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

133
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,234
I mean it. baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

134
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,697
I take his weapons away.

135
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,993
Both of them.

136
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,631
Hell of a way to end a partnership.

137
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,550
For God's sakes.
don't make it any worse.

138
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,097
-Don't make me kiII you.
-Doing fine. Bob.

139
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,307
Never better.

140
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,812
I'm ready to kick your ass.

141
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,898
Keep him talking. Buy time.

142
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,359
Just a few more minutes.
Just till the backup gets here.

143
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,571
Sit down and stay down.
I'II kiII you if I have to.

144
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,325
Keep his mind off the girl,
skinny little Nancy.

145
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,411
He can't kill her
once the backup gets here.

146
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,038
Run home. Nancy. Run for your Iife.

147
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,083
Hey. Don't Iisten to him.
He's a crazy man.

148
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,378
-What a tough man you are. huh?
-You stay right where you're at.

149
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:58,508
You shoot your partner in the back
then you try to scare a IittIe girI.

150
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,677
Maybe I'II puII my spare rod.

151
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,138
pIug you a coupIe of times.
show you how it's done.

152
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,390
We couId've worked something out.
but you've bIown that.

153
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,852
Sit down or I'II bIast you in haIf.

154
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,855
-You're so sIow. you'II never stop me.
-Sit down.

155
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,691
You'II never be abIe to stop me.

156
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,287
I finally sit down,
just like you told me to.

157
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,999
The sirens are close now.

158
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,835
She'll be safe.

159
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:46,222
Things go dark. l don't mind much .

160
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,894
Getting sleepy. lt's okay.

161
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,979
She'll be safe.

162
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,398
An old man dies.

163
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,942
a little girl lives.

164
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,986
Fair trade.

165
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,952
The night is hot as hell.

166
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,664
lt's a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town .

167
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,751
l'm staring at a goddess.

168
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,504
She's telling me she wants me.

169
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,466
l'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how l've gotten so lucky.

170
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,926
I want you.

171
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,640
She smells like angels ought to smell.

172
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,354
The perfect woman .

173
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,318
The goddess.

174
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,658
I need you.

175
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,079
Goldie.

176
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,289
She says her name is Goldie.

177
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,301
Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.

178
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,471
And that cold thing
happens to my stomach .

179
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:12,475
And l realize Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.

180
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,895
You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers

181
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,940
aren't moving like they would
if she was breathing.

182
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,651
She was murdered and l was
right here when it happened.

183
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:26,447
Lying next to her,
stone drunk, just like she was.

184
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,869
Damn it, Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?

185
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,204
Who were you
besides an angel of mercy,

186
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,541
giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?

187
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,335
lt sure as hell wasn't my looks.

188
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,046
So why the sleazy saloon?

189
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,424
why the kindness, Goldie?

190
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,346
The cops, they're telling me too much ,

191
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,682
showing up before anybody
but me and the killer

192
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,851
could know there's been a murder.

193
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,187
Somebody paid good money
for this frame.

194
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,524
No reason at all to play it quiet.

195
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,652
No reason to play it any way
but my way.

196
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,993
Whoever killed you
is gonna pay, Goldie.

197
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,750
Open up. poIice!

198
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,627
I'II be right out.

199
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,117
l don't know why you died, Goldie.

200
00:15:55,704 --> 00:16:00,083
l don't know why and l don't know how
l never even met you before tonight,

201
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,586
but you were a friend and more
when l needed one.

202
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,589
And when l find out who did it.

203
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,592
It won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you .

204
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,262
lt'll be loud and nasty, my kind of kill.

205
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,599
And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I send him to

206
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,686
will seem like heaven
after what l've done to him.

207
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,896
l love you, Goldie.

208
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,627
CIaire?

209
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,183
Now. don't worry. LuciIIe.
I was just grazed.

210
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:04,105
-You got any beers around this pIace?
-No way am I giving you any aIcohoI.

211
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,526
Besides. it's not what
you came here for anyway. is it?

212
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,278
No.

213
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,780
Go ahead. You're worse without them.

214
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,324
Thanks. You're the best.

215
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,785
Lucille's my parole officer.

216
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,329
She's a dyke, but God knows why.

217
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,083
With that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.

218
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,878
The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.

219
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,631
She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.

220
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,135
Haven't seen you Iike this in a whiIe.

221
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,846
Got in a fight with some cops.

222
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,890
Didn't happen to kiII any of them.
did you?

223
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,266
Not that I know of.

224
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,352
But they know they've been in a fight.
that's for damn sure.

225
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,105
How the hell do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

226
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,358
There ain't no squaring it.
Not this time.

227
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,861
This isn't some barroom brawI.

228
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,198
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

229
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,783
Hey. hey. This is big.

230
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,661
-SettIe down. Marv. Take another piII.
-Hey. there ain't no settIing down !

231
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,790
This is bIood for bIood.
and by the gaIIons.

232
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:08,377
This is the oId days and the bad days.
the all-or-nothing days.

233
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,172
They're back. There's no choices Ieft.

234
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,216
And I'm ready for war.

235
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,719
Prison was heII for you. Marv.
It's gonna be Iife this time.

236
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,891
HeII's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

237
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,644
But I'm out now.

238
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:28,397
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting kiIIed to do it.

239
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,401
But I'm out.
I know exactIy what I gotta do.

240
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,991
So you were scared,
weren't you, Goldie?

241
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,786
Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.

242
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,831
So you hit the saloons, the bad places,

243
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,584
looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.

244
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,004
Well, l'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you ,

245
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,882
and l'm gonna give him
the hard good-bye.

246
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,262
walk down the right back alley
in Sin City. . .

247
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,888
Leave your hands off Nancy.

248
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,807
. . .and you could find anything.

249
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,268
That coat Iooks Iike Baghdad.

250
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,521
So does your face. Take off!

251
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,946
He's new here. Marv. He didn't know.

252
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,240
Kadie's is my kind of joint.

253
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,119
Nancy's just getting started
with her gig,

254
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,496
but already the crowd's
breathing hard.

255
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,833
Plenty of nights
l've drooled over Nancy,

256
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,920
shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.

257
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,923
But that's not
what l'm looking for tonight.

258
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,634
What'II it be. Marv?

259
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,470
A shot and a brew. SheIIie.
and keep them coming.

260
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,307
Sure. honey. You take it sIow. now.

261
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,909
Most people think Marv is crazy.

262
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,996
He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.

263
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,498
He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield.

264
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,001
swinging an axe into somebody's face.

265
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,669
Or in a Roman arena

266
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,505
taking a sword
to other gladiators like him.

267
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,676
They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then .

268
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,307
Show's over. dickwad. Drink up.

269
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,685
Now. that's one fine-Iooking coat
you're wearing there.

270
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,981
Your kiIIing days are over.

271
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,109
you over-the-hiII.
do-gooder son of a bitch.

272
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:42,281
l love hit men . No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad.

273
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,583
-Take it off.
-What?

274
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,211
A fine coat Iike that.
and you're bIeeding aII over it.

275
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,880
AII right. it's aII yours. Oh. God !

276
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,342
It wasn't you Iosers who kiIIed GoIdie.

277
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,721
The guy who did that.
he knew what he was doing.

278
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,058
So teII me. man. Who sent you?

279
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,772
I don't hear you giving me any names.

280
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,442
So I guess when I shot you in the beIIy
I aimed a IittIe too high.

281
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,406
You keep holding out on me like this,

282
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,908
and l'm gonna have to get really nasty.

283
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:34,667
It was TeIIy. . .
TeIIy Stern passed me the order.

284
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,629
He runs the tabIes over
to the TripIe Ace CIub.

285
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,424
Thanks again.

286
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,265
Then the damnedest thing happens.

287
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,311
For a second, I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.

288
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,771
Just need my medicine, is all.

289
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,107
Bastard.

290
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,110
You're gonna pay
for what you did to me.

291
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,032
FeeI Iike taIking. Louie?

292
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,534
How many got paid off
for the frame. Louie?

293
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,536
How many for the kiII?

294
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,289
It was ConneIIy. He set me up.

295
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,418
He'II never taIk.

296
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,883
I don't know about you.
but I'm having a baII.

297
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,763
Connelly talks. They all talk.

298
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,350
And what have been
your sins. my son?

299
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,061
WeII. Padre.
I don't want to keep you up aII night.

300
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,022
so I'II just fiII you in on the Iatest batch.

301
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,317
These here hands of mine.
they got bIood aII over them.

302
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,402
You're speaking figurativeIy.

303
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:48,199
When I need to find something out.
I just go out and Iook for somebody

304
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,659
that knows more than me.
and I go and I ask them.

305
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,329
Sometimes. I ask pretty hard.

306
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:58,584
By way of a for instance.
I kiIIed three men tonight.

307
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,504
Tortured them first.

308
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,758
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

309
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,677
First two were minnows.
smaII-time messengers.

310
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:13,307
But it was ConneIIy. the money man.
who fingered you. Padre.

311
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,602
Dear Lord. man. this is a house of God.

312
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,188
Just give me a damn name.

313
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,857
Roark.

314
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,776
You reaIIy are pushing your Iuck.
Padre.

315
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,778
feeding me garbage Iike that.

316
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,030
It can't be that big.

317
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,157
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

318
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,035
It's all there. Find out for yourseIf.

319
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,037
And whiIe you're at it.

320
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:40,126
ask yourself if that corpse of a sIut
is worth dying for.

321
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,170
Worth dying for.

322
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,047
Worth kiIIing for.

323
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,550
Worth going to heII for.

324
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,677
Amen.

325
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,308
His keys say
the padre drove a Mercedes,

326
00:23:56,393 --> 00:24:00,062
or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.

327
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,524
Modern cars.
they all look like electric shavers.

328
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,575
GoIdie.

329
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,370
GoIdie!

330
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,300
It couldn't be Goldie.

331
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,387
It's my own fault, and nobody else's,
that l got confused.

332
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,224
I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.

333
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,477
That wasn't Goldie back there.

334
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,061
Goldie's dead.

335
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:45,065
and that's the whole reason that l've
been doing what l've been doing.

336
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,777
When you got a condition ,
it's bad to forget your medicine.

337
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,157
The cold thing,

338
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,286
It creeps into my gut and tells me
one more time it won't let go.

339
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,414
This is a bad place, this farm.

340
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,458
People have died here,

341
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,711
the wrong way.

342
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,424
I don't want to fight. pooch.

343
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,472
I got no gripe with you.

344
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,309
Easy. boy.

345
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,774
No way l was gonna use
my gun on you , buddy.

346
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,485
It's whoever owns you
I'm curious about.

347
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:33,739
because there's blood on your breath ,
and l think l know what kind.

348
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,408
So I sniff around to see what's buried.

349
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,497
Here we go.

350
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,297
It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.

351
00:25:55,762 --> 00:26:00,516
I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.

352
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,645
Nobody except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.

353
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:08,190
It was you. you bastard. You kiIIed her.

354
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,693
You kiIIed GoIdie.

355
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,194
It was. . .

356
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,198
l blew it. Goldie.

357
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,368
l found your killer,
but he was better than me.

358
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,620
Too quiet, too quick.

359
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,872
A killer born.

360
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,500
why didn't he finish the job?

361
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,267
He keeps the heads. He eats the rest.

362
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,812
-LuciIIe?
-It's not just that woIf of his.

363
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,317
The woIf just gets scraps.

364
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,736
Bones.

365
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,487
It's him.

366
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,451
He eats peopIe.

367
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,247
-He cooks them Iike they were steaks.
-Let's get you warm.

368
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,541
Just Iike they were steaks.

369
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,585
Now he's got both of us.

370
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,589
It's all right. Take a nice. sIow breath.

371
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,717
Just Iook at the heads on the waII.

372
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:21,263
The heads on the wall.

373
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,893
Son of a bitch !
He kept smiIing that damned smiIe.

374
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,938
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

375
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,858
-He made me watch.
-Oh. Jesus.

376
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,903
He made me watch !

377
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,790
Christ. I couId use a cigarette.

378
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,294
Dames. Sometimes all they
gotta do is let it out.

379
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,589
And a few buckets later.
there's no way you'd know.

380
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,384
You've brought us
some big troubIe this time. Marv.

381
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,302
Whoever's behind this whole thing

382
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,888
has his connections right
in the department.

383
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,807
Any leads?

384
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,311
One guy I taIked to toId me
it was Roark running the show.

385
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,022
Whoever it is.
he knew I was checking out

386
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,233
that hooker aImost before I did.

387
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,653
-What hooker?
-The one you've been obsessing over.

388
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,822
The dead one.

389
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,573
GoIdie.

390
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,410
I didn't know she was a hooker.

391
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,538
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

392
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:34,002
-But I didn't know that.
-She was high-cIass stuff.

393
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,422
She must have shown you quite a time.

394
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,007
Quiet. There's a car coming.

395
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,971
Kevin.

396
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,810
All i've got is a face and a name.

397
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,937
I'II see you later. Kevin.

398
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,031
Let's go.

399
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,633
They're done checking the house.

400
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,927
They're coming this way.

401
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,430
Bastards. I'll show them.

402
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,730
You're not gonna get
either of us kiIIed. Marv.

403
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,942
No. don't shoot. PIease.

404
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,361
Listen to me. I'm his paroIe officer.

405
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,489
He's unconscious and unarmed.

406
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,991
so there's no need to kill him.

407
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,334
Captain. the target.
there's no sign of him.

408
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,710
Here's a sign.

409
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:15,437
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

410
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,615
I keep coming back to that cop
I just killed and what he told me.

411
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,451
l was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille.

412
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,454
so l took my time
with that son of a bitch.

413
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,458
lt wasn't till I showed him all those
pieces of himself that he said it.

414
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:42,130
Just a name.
Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth .

415
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,175
Could've become president,
but he chose to serve God.

416
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,302
Along the way,
he just happened to become

417
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,805
the most powerful man in the state.

418
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,308
He's brought down mayors
and governors like they were nothing.

419
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,855
He even made his rotten brother a
US senator without breaking a sweat.

420
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,900
And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.

421
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,903
I'm getting used to the idea.

422
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,447
More and more.
I'm liking the sound of it.

423
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,743
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.

424
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,663
what if I'm wrong?

425
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,498
I've got a condition .

426
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,667
I get confused sometimes.

427
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,504
And with Lucille dead.
I can't get my medicine.

428
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,215
what if i've imagined all of this?

429
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,175
what if i've finally turned into what

430
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,761
they've always said
l was gonna turn into?

431
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,306
A maniac.

432
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,683
A psycho killer.

433
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:39,021
Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.

434
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,189
I've gotta know for sure.

435
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,986
The merchandise is on display

436
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,530
by the time i make my way
to Old Town.

437
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,199
For an hour or so.
I asked around about Goldie.

438
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,952
l don't get any answers,
but l know I'm bound to.

439
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,288
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker.

440
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,333
and if she was. she has roots here.

441
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,793
friends, maybe even family.

442
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,927
You can't be Goldie. Goldie's dead.

443
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,316
Goldie. Yeah. sure. right.

444
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,737
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

445
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,906
No wonder I'm seeing things.

446
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,240
Bastard.

447
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,207
He's crazy.

448
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,585
Hit him again. Wendy. Harder.

449
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,422
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

450
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,758
Because that's my name. you ape.

451
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,554
Goldie was my sister. My twin sister.

452
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,224
I guess she was the nice one.

453
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,442
Goldie and the other six.
where are they?

454
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,277
What did you do to them?

455
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,613
You crazy goddamn broad.

456
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,032
Just take a look at this mug.

457
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,744
WouId any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

458
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,832
None of you wouId. but Goldie.

459
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,168
And she onIy did because
she thought I couId protect her.

460
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:29,631
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girIs. did they?

461
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,385
But as soon as they had me
for a fall guy.

462
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,138
they showed up. guns blazing.

463
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,889
But they didn't get me.

464
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,143
and I've been killing my way
to the truth ever since.

465
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,395
So. go ahead. doll.

466
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:48,775
Shoot me now.
or get the hell out of my way.

467
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,368
Aw. nuts.

468
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,372
Okay. I'm gIad we got
all that sorted out.

469
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:08,128
-What the hell?
-I tied those knots. That's my speciaIty.

470
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,130
You sat there and took it.

471
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,175
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to.

472
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,596
Well. sure. I thought I might be abIe
to talk some sense into you.

473
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,016
And I probably wouId have had
to paste you one.

474
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,268
and I don't hurt girIs.

475
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,604
I need a pair of handcuffs.

476
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,607
What styIe do you want?
I got a collection.

477
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,651
Just give him the ones
you got with you. Gail.

478
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,822
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie.

479
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,367
but it was CardinaI Roark who
was behind it. and I don't know why.

480
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,703
I know that sounds crazy.

481
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,165
No. it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

482
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:49,461
Just like that, a whopper of
a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap.

483
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:52,255
l'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet,

484
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,592
but she fires up two cigarettes
and hands me one.

485
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,385
and i taste her lipstick on it.

486
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,890
And suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud i can't hear anything else.

487
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,642
l want to reach over and touch her

488
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,561
and taste Goldie's sweat
one more time.

489
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,897
But she isn't Goldie.

490
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,941
Yeah , yeah . This'll do.

491
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:16,655
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing

492
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,033
and a spool of razor wire

493
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:25,413
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

494
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,083
Beefing up the old home security. huh?

495
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,252
You can bet your ass.

496
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:34,172
She was my sister.
so I'm in this one to the end.

497
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,091
But why are you willing
to go up against Roark

498
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,759
for someone you barely knew?

499
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:42,597
She was nice to me. gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

500
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,935
I wasn't never even able
to buy a woman.

501
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,771
You know. the way I look.

502
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:55,110
I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.

503
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,071
It's almost killing time,
and I'd better get sharp.

504
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:02,534
I check the list.
rubber tubing, gas, saw,

505
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:06,496
gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,

506
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,082
Gladys and my mitts.

507
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,794
-We're close enough. Pull over.
-Yes. Marv.

508
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,714
Keep the engine running.

509
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:20,468
If I'm not back in 20 minutes. you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

510
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,429
KiII him for me. Marv.

511
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,641
KiII him good.

512
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,768
I won't let you down. Goldie.

513
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,912
Heading downstairs to the kitchen .

514
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:51,416
Getting himself a midnight snack,
and I can guess what kind.

515
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,682
Come on. you son of a bitch.

516
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,227
Damn . he's slick.

517
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,033
Is that the best you can do. creep?

518
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,538
That's right. Get personal, get close.
I can take it.

519
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,794
I got you. you littIe bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

520
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:45,220
l try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.

521
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,182
My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.

522
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,894
Let me do it. Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

523
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,438
You wasn't supposed
to come down here. Wendy.

524
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,524
Oh. but I want to. . .

525
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,445
l'm sorry, kid, but I haven't
even started with this creep,

526
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,950
and I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.

527
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,995
God. I gotta tell you.
I'm good and bushed.

528
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,123
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in. either.

529
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,001
It's all that sawing and tying.

530
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,087
It's not as easy as it looks.

531
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,298
Could have been
a real mess around here

532
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,010
If I didn't have that tubing
for tourniquets.

533
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:30,765
I gotta admit. there was a spurt or two.

534
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,643
to get the scent in the air.

535
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,105
to get that friend of yours
to come running.

536
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,610
Well. what do you know?

537
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,863
Look who's here.

538
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,282
Here he comes.

539
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,915
That's a good dog.

540
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,754
He doesn't scream.
not even when the mutt's had its fill

541
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,340
and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.

542
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,427
Somehow the bastard is still alive.
still staring at me.

543
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,847
Not even when i grab the saw
and finish the job.

544
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,892
He never screams.

545
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,815
I put in a call to Kadie's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on

546
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,277
and meet me at her place.
She says, "Yes" , like always.

547
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,280
Hey. Nancy. you got any beers?

548
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,075
Sure. Marv. Who's the babe?

549
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,036
There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.

550
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,830
Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up

551
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,249
and I straightened him out but good.

552
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,961
It really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames.

553
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,880
So. what do you want me
to do with her?

554
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:48,510
Well. your best bet is drive her
all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

555
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,679
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

556
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,641
Hell. no. I like it here.

557
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,397
I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit

558
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,857
so as not to get any attention .

559
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:07,028
My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.

560
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,905
I owe you, Goldie.

561
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,116
I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.

562
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,536
So, if going after Roark
means dying, win or lose,

563
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,957
hell, l'll die laughing
if l know l've done this one thing right.

564
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,089
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

565
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,007
All right, keep a lookout.

566
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,111
-Kevin?
-What's left of him. anyways.

567
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,781
The dog ate the rest.

568
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:03,501
Oh. my God. You monster.

569
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,671
You demon.

570
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,090
Don't scream or I'll pIug you.

571
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:15,013
He had the voice of an angel.
yet he spoke only to me.

572
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:19,017
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

573
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:24,355
It's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while I'm around.

574
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,233
When he came to me

575
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,778
he was a tormented boy.

576
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,991
Tormented by guilt.

577
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,786
I tried to counsel him.

578
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:45,126
But the eating.
it filled him with white light.

579
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:49,631
Tearful. he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

580
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,800
What the hell do you know?

581
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,512
I know it's pretty damn weird
to eat people.

582
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,431
He didn't just eat their bodies.

583
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,267
he ate their souls.

584
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,979
And I joined in.

585
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,527
They were all whores.

586
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,198
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

587
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:21,162
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything.

588
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,540
She stayed in public places.

589
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,750
And then with you .

590
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,585
You were so convenient.

591
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,463
You'd broke a man's jaw
that very night.

592
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,882
Who would beIieve a thug like you?

593
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,968
Kevin killed her.

594
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,888
I ordered the police in for you ,
but you wouldn't be caught.

595
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,390
You wouldn't stop.

596
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,309
And now he's dead and you're here to

597
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,688
eliminate me.

598
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,109
Will that give you satisfaction. my son?

599
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:57,699
Killing a helpless old fart?

600
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,743
The killing. no.

601
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,662
No satisfaction.

602
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,459
Everything up until the killing
will be a gas.

603
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,131
Kevin.

604
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,011
we're going home.

605
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,058
You can scream now if you want to.

606
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:36,321
It's beautiful. Goldie.
It's just like I promised, only better.

607
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,364
And when his eyes go dead,

608
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:42,368
the hell I sent him to must seem like
heaven after what l've done to him.

609
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,622
Freeze!
Oh. my God !

610
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,048
Jerks.

611
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,926
They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure.

612
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,845
It's so stupid.

613
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,097
Everybody knows what's coming,

614
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,891
but they go through
the motions anyway.

615
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,060
what a waste of time.

616
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:11,564
Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.

617
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:15,276
Night after night, I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.

618
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:19,614
After a while. I realize
it's not gonna be so easy as that.

619
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,367
I'm on my feet for about 10 minutes

620
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,994
before the cops kick them out
from under me.

621
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,080
They don't ask me any questions.

622
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:29,457
They just keep knocking
the crap out of me

623
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,876
and waving a confession in my face.

624
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,961
And I keep spitting blood all over it

625
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,298
and laughing at how many
fresh copies they come up with .

626
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,258
Then along comes this worm

627
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,095
assistant district attorney
who turns the recorder off

628
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:46,724
and says if I don't sign
their confession , they'll kill my mom.

629
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,144
I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.

630
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,314
From then on .
it's the circus everybody wants it to be.

631
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,777
They nail me for the works,
not just the people l did kill,

632
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,948
but even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate.

633
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,158
and even Goldie.

634
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,455
The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.

635
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,876
Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away,

636
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,004
when I get my first surprise
in 18 months.

637
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,174
My only visitor.

638
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,845
I'm ready for anything but that scent.

639
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,265
I got them for you good.
didn't I. Goldie?

640
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:37,400
I'm sorry. Wendy. I got confused again.

641
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,945
Just seeing you like this.

642
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,867
You can call me Goldie.

643
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,962
She smells like angels ought to smell.

644
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,298
The perfect woman .

645
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,800
The goddess.

646
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,553
Goldie.

647
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,473
She says her name is Goldie.

648
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:15,229
They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.

649
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,939
They even throw in a brew.

650
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,734
It's the first I've had
since back at Nancy's.

651
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:24,447
Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.

652
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,408
And it's about damned time.
if you ask me.

653
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,077
"Yea. though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death. . ."

654
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,830
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

655
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,750
You heard the man. Hit it.

656
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:48,012
Is that the best you can do.
you pansies?

657
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,276
He's gone.

658
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,213
Forget it. man.

659
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,340
You can bang on that door
aII night if you want to.

660
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,134
There is no way in hell
I'm letting you in.

661
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,221
I can't believe
you're doing this to me. Shellie.

662
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,726
Everything we've shared.
it has to mean something to you.

663
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,353
It meant plenty.

664
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,273
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to fIirt with a waitress

665
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,984
whose face is all purpIe
and swollen up with bruises.

666
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,652
I know you're angry. baby.

667
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,905
And I forgive you for that
without you even asking me to.

668
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,740
There's a difference
between getting honked off

669
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,659
at a guy who's generally not so bad.

670
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:55,746
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk Ioser

671
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,374
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

672
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,168
every time he gets drunk.
which is way too often.

673
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,171
Especially the kind of totaI jerk loser

674
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,341
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

675
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,844
That hurt. Shellie.

676
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:13,055
It's one thing for you
to pIay hard to get.

677
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,516
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

678
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,185
I am impossibIe to get.

679
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:23,274
Do yourself a favor. Jackie Boy.
and get help. like a shrink.

680
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,695
Get help and get lost.

681
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,238
Just open the door.

682
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:34,201
Go ahead and open the door. Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

683
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:38,414
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

684
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:43,252
Oblige him. Shellie. I'm ready for him.

685
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,463
No! If he knew
that you were here with me.

686
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,548
you don't know how bad this couId get.

687
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,718
This clown's got a big. mean drunk on.

688
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,970
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall.

689
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,598
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

690
00:48:55,682 --> 00:49:00,770
Hey. I couId swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

691
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:06,776
Somebody! Jackie Boy.
it's a regular African Iove fest in here.

692
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,654
-I'm no racist.
-I mean. I got me all five starters.

693
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:13,324
and half the bench of the Basin City
Blues keeping me company.

694
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,284
You feel like taking them on?

695
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,329
You are teasing me. baby.

696
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,832
Some of my best friends. . .

697
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,752
But you're really pushing my buttons.

698
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,088
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this.

699
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,132
I've been too polite to point out
that at any time I want to.

700
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,677
I could kick this damn door to splinters.

701
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,222
Okay. baby. you know what I can do.

702
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:39,183
-You know what I can do. One. two. . .
-All right. then.

703
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:42,186
All right. All right. all right.

704
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,858
Troops. make yourseIf at home.

705
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,619
You brought your whole pack with you?

706
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,540
None of these bozos got lives.
they gotta hang out with you?

707
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,291
You're gonna love this. baby.

708
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,294
You're gonna call up some
of your friends who work in the saloon.

709
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,548
With you and the bunch of us.
we're gonna hit every joint in town.

710
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,633
and it's gonna be great.

711
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,802
I ain't caIIing up nobody.

712
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:24,145
That's a man's shirt.
and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

713
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:28,274
You got somebody's love stink
aII over you.

714
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:32,153
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

715
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,989
-Who is he?
-He's Superman.

716
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,660
He fIew out the window just as soon
as he heard you were coming.

717
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,204
'cause you scared him so bad.

718
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,835
You think I have no feeIings at all.

719
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,588
If you're gonna slug me.

720
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,591
just go ahead and get it over with.
you sick bastard.

721
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,678
There you go. lying about me again.

722
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,347
right in front of my friends.

723
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,642
I have never hit a woman in my Iife.

724
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,192
That's showing her. man.

725
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:16,489
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

726
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,365
Baby. we're all here
to have a good time.

727
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,408
Yeah.

728
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,952
I gotta take a leak.

729
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,165
Wish you'd dropped by earIier.
Jackie Boy.

730
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,043
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

731
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,046
Could've seen
what a real man looks like.

732
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,800
There you go. after my nuts again.

733
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,927
But I forgive you.

734
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,887
I'm a generous guy.

735
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:44,308
He is generous.
But that temper of his. . .

736
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,937
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

737
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,482
My temper you don't have
to worry about.

738
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,859
Shut up and keep your hands
to yourseIf

739
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,570
or I'll cut your littIe pecker off.

740
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,115
Oh. I've been told.

741
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:04,995
Hey. baby.
I don't hear you making those calls.

742
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,623
Answer me.

743
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,960
Oh. I don't need this grief.

744
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:15,714
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

745
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,468
You ever so much
as taIk to Shellie again.

746
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,595
you even think her name.

747
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,224
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useIess to a woman.

748
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:29,812
You're making a big mistake. man.
A big mistake.

749
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,522
Yeah?

750
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,233
You already made
a big mistake yourself.

751
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,861
You didn't fIush.

752
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,833
Troops. get outta here.

753
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,793
No questions. damn it. No questions.

754
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,629
Now!

755
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,108
Dwight. what in the devil
did you do to him?

756
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,986
I just gave him a taste
of his own medicine.

757
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,489
I don't think
he'll be bothering you again.

758
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:07,451
-How's your jaw?
-I've been slapped around worse.

759
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:11,038
Dwight. he was from a while back.

760
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,250
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

761
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,711
And it was onIy
'cause I felt sorry for him.

762
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,297
And it was only once.

763
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,259
I've done some dumb things.

764
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,261
Seeing as how
I'm one of those dumb things.

765
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,097
I can't give you
too hard a time about that. Shellie.

766
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,767
But this guy. he's a menace.

767
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,104
He might kill somebody
if I don't stop him.

768
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,565
I'll call you later.

769
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,276
No. don't go.

770
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,778
Shellie shouts something
I can't quite make out

771
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,406
over the racket
of a passing police 'copter.

772
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,032
Stop!

773
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,243
It sounds like "stop" ,
but I can't be sure.

774
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,745
It's a chance i shouldn't be taking,

775
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,747
but I can't just go home
and forget about it,

776
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,042
and let Jackie Boy
and his pals find their fun .

777
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,836
They're a pack of predators

778
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,631
and they're out for blood tonight,
a woman's blood.

779
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,509
Damn it. Dwight. Damn it.

780
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,761
You fool.

781
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,889
You damned fool.

782
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,309
I cut my Caddy across the park

783
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,687
to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.

784
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,647
l'm speeding.

785
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,608
That's a good way
to get yourself noticed.

786
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,736
And if you're a murderer
with a new face

787
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,404
who's one fingerprint check away

788
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,157
from the fast track
to the gas chamber like I am,

789
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,285
the last thing you want
is to get noticed.

790
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,915
I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop, and even if i did,

791
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:40,461
there's always the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.

792
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,755
Do I try to talk my way out of this,

793
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:45,716
or do l take this cop down
and risk it all?

794
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:50,471
Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great, big, steaming pile of trouble.

795
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,639
Watch it. Jack.

796
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,981
Cops. They're right on our ass.

797
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,276
Not for Iong. Not where we're headed.

798
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,279
My gut tightens up.

799
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:11,867
Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.

800
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,455
The cop shuts off his siren .

801
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,750
He knows he's not the law.
not in Old Town.

802
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:24,171
The ladies are the law here.
beautiful and merciless.

803
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,173
If you've got the cash
and you play by the rules,

804
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,509
they'll make all your dreams
come true.

805
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:32,262
But if you cross them, you're a corpse.

806
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,273
Hey. baby. Hey. baby.

807
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,612
Hop in. sugar. We'll get you there.

808
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:53,200
Sweetheart. I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

809
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,203
Besides. I don't do group jobs.

810
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:00,207
Get in the car. baby.
We'll just taIk. It'll be nice.

811
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,459
I don't do talk jobs. either.

812
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:07,798
Babydoll. I've had me
one hell of a bad day.

813
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:11,552
I've been beat up
every time I turn around.

814
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,887
But the day I get turned down
by a hooker

815
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,391
when I got good.
hard-earned cash to pay her with.

816
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:22,396
Well. there's onIy so much
a man can take.

817
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,731
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

818
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,942
That's the Alamo. not the Amigo.

819
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,528
The Amigo's a fag joint.

820
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,407
Are you having a good time
humiliating me

821
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,410
Like this for no damn reason at all?

822
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,289
That's far enough. Dwight.

823
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,040
We've been on top
of these peckerwoods

824
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,585
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them.

825
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,587
Everything's under control.

826
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,756
Enjoy the show.

827
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,634
There's no use arguing with her.

828
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,471
The ladies are their own enforcers.

829
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,431
So. how's the barmaid?

830
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,932
You know.
the one that never shuts up?

831
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,477
Not right now. Gail.

832
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,271
Wound up a littIe tight. aren't we?

833
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,983
That's your whole problem. Dwight.
You worry too much.

834
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:11,278
That. and your lousy taste in women.
These days. anyway.

835
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,989
Damn it. Gail. Not right now.

836
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:18,285
Those clowns down the way.
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

837
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,120
One of them thinks he is.

838
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,955
He's outta control.

839
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,959
I followed him here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girIs.

840
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,254
Us helpless littIe girls.

841
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:34,426
All kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us,

842
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,930
and still it's hard
to take my eyes off her.

843
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,766
Us girls are safe
as we can be. LanceIot.

844
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,393
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

845
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,354
from seeing what Miho can do.

846
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,525
And she's been aching
for some practice.

847
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:54,821
She guides my glance upwards to
the pixie perched on the roof's edge.

848
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,533
Deadly little Miho.

849
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,826
You're running out of alley. cowboy.

850
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:04,498
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

851
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,833
You're a sassy littIe thing.

852
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:11,880
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

853
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:15,968
The trap is set,
locked and ready to spring.

854
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:20,055
So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.

855
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,684
So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?

856
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,853
They haven't killed anybody
I know about.

857
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:31,483
It got pretty bad at Shellie's pIace.
but they didn't kill anybody.

858
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,068
And they won't.

859
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,362
why this rotten feeling?

860
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,824
Something Shellie said. l can't place it.

861
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:43,203
Okay. okay. okay. I sounded off
a littIe more than I shouId have.

862
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,582
-I'm a little on edge.
-Over the edge.

863
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,626
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

864
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:53,005
You couldn't handle a woman.
the state you're in.

865
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,300
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes. Jack.

866
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,053
You wanna see it?

867
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,016
You wanna see what I got?

868
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:09,062
I've seen all shapes. all sizes.

869
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,898
You seen this one?

870
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,153
Get in the car.

871
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:21,074
Sugar. you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

872
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,593
Oh. God. no.

873
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,971
This is crazy.

874
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,892
Out of nowhere. for no reason at all.

875
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,484
Go ahead.

876
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,778
Go ahead. Go ahead.

877
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,448
-He's got the drop on her.
-He's got squat.

878
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,660
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

879
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:11,375
I got you right where I want you.

880
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:15,212
This is a career-ending wound. whore.

881
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:19,299
-And there's gonna be hell to pay.
-Watch your step. Jackie Boy.

882
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,136
Yeesh.

883
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,813
This isn't funny.

884
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:37,234
Don't anyone Iaugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

885
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,820
Everyone of you is gonna burn.

886
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,990
 Hang it up she`s just playing with you.

887
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,993
-You're only making it worse.
-You shut the hell up.

888
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:51,498
Don't pull the trigger.
She bIocked the barrel. It'll backfire.

889
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:54,668
I toId you to shut up.

890
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,008
I can't see.

891
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,219
What's happening?

892
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,014
I can't see.

893
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,684
I can't hear anything.

894
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:14,104
For God's sake. Miho. finish him.

895
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:18,066
Yeah. Make it quick. will you?

896
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,363
She doesn't quite chop his head off.

897
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,161
She makes a Pez dispenser
out of him.

898
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,873
Then it's straight to business,

899
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,125
stretching the corpses out
on the alley floor

900
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:38,879
and going through their pockets,
divvying up cash when they find it.

901
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,506
I'm fishing around
in Jackie Boy's pants.

902
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,341
His wallet is packed.

903
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:47,304
Master Card. Discover.
Platinum American Express,

904
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,723
and nearly 300 bucks
worth of twenties

905
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,893
that l'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.

906
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,896
Then l find an atom bomb.

907
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,900
Jackie Boy,

908
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,903
you son of a bitch .

909
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,910
There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket,

910
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,454
I couldn't quite make out
what she said.

911
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,415
I thought Shellie said "Stop."

912
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,459
She said "Cop" .

913
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,254
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.

914
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,466
Iron Jack, the papers call him.

915
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,761
A goddamn hero cop.

916
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,225
It's held for years, the shaky truce.

917
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,143
The cops get a slice of the profits

918
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,437
and free entertainment
when they throw a party.

919
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,398
The girls get to administer
their own brand of justice.

920
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:43,318
They get to defend their own turf.

921
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,445
If a cop blunders
into the neighborhood

922
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,739
and he's not shopping
for what the girls are selling,

923
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:52,118
they send him packing,
but they send him back alive.

924
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,621
That's the rules.

925
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,540
That's the truce.

926
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,959
The cops stay out.

927
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:02,462
That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.

928
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,257
Old Town will be left wide open.

929
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,967
It'll be war.

930
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,470
The streets will run red with blood.

931
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,223
women's blood.

932
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,142
The cops. The mob.

933
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,645
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be.

934
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:22,482
The hell they will. We got guns.

935
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,985
We'll fight the cops and the mob

936
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:28,280
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

937
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:30,156
-We'll go to war.
-Don't be stupid. Gail.

938
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,159
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

939
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,621
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

940
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,164
I'II hide the bodies.

941
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,501
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

942
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,004
The cops know Rafferty came here.

943
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,173
They'll check the river.
they'll check the sewer.

944
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,718
They'll find him
and they'll come gunning for us.

945
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:52,721
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check the pits.

946
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,848
Get that gun out of my face
or I'll smack you.

947
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:58,184
Who do you think you are.
giving orders?

948
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,438
-You got what you wanted out of us.
-Shut up. Gail.

949
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,899
You got what you wanted out of me.

950
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,736
And you were gone.
off playing with that barmaid.

951
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:11,156
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

952
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:14,826
Miho moves to my back.

953
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,164
One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.

954
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:23,043
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

955
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:26,046
It'll be the bad old days all over again.

956
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:29,299
The pimps. the beatings.
the drugs. the rapes.

957
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,301
They won't be watching the roads.
Not yet. they won't.

958
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,094
Get me a damn hardtop.

959
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,555
If I don't make it.
you can have your war.

960
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,391
Get that gun out of my face now.

961
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,270
Bastard !

962
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,569
I forgot how quick you are.

963
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,156
My warrior woman .

964
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,742
She almost yanks my head clean off,

965
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:59,245
shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.

966
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,832
An explosion that blasts away
the dull, gray years

967
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:07,212
between the now and that one
fiery night when she was mine.

968
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:10,715
A hardtop with a decent engine.

969
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,593
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

970
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:17,847
I'll always love you. baby.

971
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:22,143
Always and never.

972
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,570
Where'd you find that heap?

973
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:36,116
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit them all in.

974
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,786
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do.

975
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,788
you think maybe I couId go home?

976
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:45,917
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

977
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,253
Sure. Becky. go home.

978
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:51,172
But don't you talk to anybody.
not even your mom.

979
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,717
They'll never fit in that trunk.

980
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:57,637
Not like this. they won't. Miho.

981
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,306
Dry your hair as soon as you get home.

982
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,350
You'll catch cold if you don't.

983
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,610
Yeesh.

984
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:17,157
Hey. Becky. Gail said no calls.

985
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:20,744
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

986
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,996
PIease. don't say nothing to Gail.

987
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,375
Hey. Mom?

988
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,089
Dizzy dames.

989
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,215
what were they thinking,

990
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,218
sticking me with a beat-up bucket
of bolts like this?

991
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:40,013
we were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was,

992
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,598
we packed it so tight.

993
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:46,519
There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,

994
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:50,482
out where anybody who cares to look
will see him.

995
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,695
Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes.

996
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,198
It'll help.

997
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:27,102
It's got you smoking there. bud.

998
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,901
You shut the hell up. Jackie Boy.

999
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,903
You're dead.

1000
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,824
I'm just imagining this.
so shut the hell up.

1001
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:46,079
Well. it tells you something
about your state of mind. don't it?

1002
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:49,207
It's got you hearing things.

1003
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,835
It's got your nerves shot.

1004
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,046
It's got you smoking.

1005
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:58,133
You know it's true.

1006
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:02,512
Nobody ever really quits.

1007
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:09,310
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

1008
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:13,314
-And your chips are down.
-I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

1009
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:17,902
Will you look at that?

1010
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:23,783
Those hookers let you down.

1011
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:28,872
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas. call AAA?

1012
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:34,043
You sucker for the babes. you.

1013
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:37,422
You ain't even gonna make it
to the pits.

1014
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:40,341
You shut the hell up. I'll make it.

1015
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,803
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road. sugar pie.

1016
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,513
Watch it!

1017
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,768
This is great.

1018
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,813
Just like being in a buddy movie.

1019
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,648
Shut up!

1020
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,323
Boy. you're screwed.

1021
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:05,325
It's over.

1022
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,702
You're flushed.

1023
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,414
This time. I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

1024
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:14,000
Sure. he's an asshole.

1025
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,337
Sure. he's dead.

1026
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,715
Sure. I'm just imagining
that he's talking.

1027
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:25,637
None of that stops the bastard from
being absoluteIy right.

1028
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:29,224
I don't have a chance in hell
of out running this cop.

1029
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,351
Not in this heap.

1030
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,811
Pull over.

1031
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:39,108
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

1032
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,194
Tough call.

1033
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,948
For all I know.
he's an honest cop. regular guy.

1034
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:48,910
a working stiff with a mortgage.
a wife and a pile of kids.

1035
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,579
My hand moves all on its own.

1036
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:55,541
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

1037
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,170
I don't know what to do.

1038
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,757
You better stop.
You're making him mad.

1039
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,052
Whatever you say.

1040
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:18,231
Your friend here.
party a littIe too hard tonight?

1041
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,818
I'm the designated driver.

1042
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,201
You're driving with a busted tail light.

1043
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,626
I'll let you off with a warning.

1044
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,760
What next?

1045
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:56,352
The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits.

1046
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,731
l shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.

1047
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:03,067
A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over.

1048
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:06,487
Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,

1049
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,992
l'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks.
go home and call it a. . .

1050
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,964
No more questions. Dallas.
Do what I say.

1051
01:12:24,964 --> 01:12:28,302
Clear the streets, We`re in lockdown

1052
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,720
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

1053
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,597
Not tonight.

1054
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,854
Don't struggle. You'll only hurt yourself.

1055
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,648
Your cause is lost.

1056
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,567
We know everything.

1057
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:48,529
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession.

1058
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:53,743
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1059
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:57,038
There'll be arrests. There'll be deaths.

1060
01:12:57,122 --> 01:13:01,125
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

1061
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:05,630
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1062
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:10,843
But. it is within your power
to save many lives

1063
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:15,139
by facilitating the process of transition.

1064
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:21,270
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1065
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:24,065
Son of a bitch. I know you.

1066
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:28,820
I have suffered your kind before.
the dregs of Sin City.

1067
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,155
I serve a new master now.

1068
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:34,534
and soon you
and all your wretched kind

1069
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,035
will serve him as well.

1070
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:41,541
Now. get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must.

1071
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,211
because. by now. he is surely dead.

1072
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:47,171
You don't know him.

1073
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:50,216
My man will find a way.

1074
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:53,886
He always finds a way.

1075
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:58,015
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1076
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:01,227
and going on about
how they got it so bad.

1077
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,771
This is a fine. grand country.

1078
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,274
Guiding light of the modern world. it is.

1079
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:09,527
Low taxes. land of opportunity.

1080
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,114
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1081
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:16,075
Sure beats the living hell out of
blowing up airports and churches

1082
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,411
without shite to show for it.

1083
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,789
Yeesh.

1084
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,209
You find something. Murphy?

1085
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:28,296
Looks to be a poor. dead cop's badge.

1086
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,298
It's all bent up.

1087
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:32,425
What's this stuck in it?

1088
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,761
Bloody hell. It's the bullet.

1089
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:47,940
You son of a bitch ! Bastard !

1090
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:52,111
They weren't cops, these four.

1091
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,113
They were mercenaries.

1092
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,574
And if they were hired
by who i think they were,

1093
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:59,118
the bad times haven't even started yet.

1094
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:02,955
And everything seemed
to be going so well.

1095
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:17,136
Remember. we don't have to deliver

1096
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,889
every last inch of the man. Brian.

1097
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:22,350
You got a good point there. Ronnie.

1098
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,435
Lend me your knife.

1099
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:28,898
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1100
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:31,484
I'm at the bone. all right?

1101
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,322
There we go.

1102
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:43,329
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1103
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:47,542
We'll be back for the three of you.
and if anyone happens by.

1104
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:50,378
use your imagination. okay?

1105
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:03,391
Silence. now.

1106
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,768
No air to breathe.

1107
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,855
Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.

1108
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:15,486
Let it in . Let it fill your lungs.

1109
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:19,115
They were counting on you
and you blew it.

1110
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:24,370
Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.

1111
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:27,415
Miho, you're an angel.

1112
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,042
You're a saint.

1113
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,295
You're Mother Teresa.

1114
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,213
You're Elvis.

1115
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,465
You're God.

1116
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,802
And if you'd shown up
10 minutes earlier.

1117
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:42,388
we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.

1118
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,183
Dwight. they got Gail.

1119
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,688
It's a cinch.
You got yourseIves a spy in OId Town.

1120
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:53,274
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1121
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:56,360
We gotta find out who it is
and rescue Gail.

1122
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:58,696
But first. we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head

1123
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,072
before it gets to wherever it's going

1124
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,867
and this whole situation
blows wide open.

1125
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:08,122
Miho. I hope to hell you Ieft
one of them alive enough to talk.

1126
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:19,133
I let him know l'm not fooling around.

1127
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,389
we talk.

1128
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,444
Stay smart. Stay cool.

1129
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:42,365
It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn .

1130
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,409
Sometimes, that means dying.

1131
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:49,080
Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people.

1132
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,208
There they are. What do we do?

1133
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,418
We stop them. Dallas.

1134
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:04,637
Jackie Boy's head is so close to me

1135
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:08,057
I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.

1136
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,981
Get the head ! Get the head !

1137
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:19,985
I got it! I got it!

1138
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:29,286
Suck on this. you stupid slag.

1139
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:35,918
I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead.

1140
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:40,548
but I'm on my feet and every ounce
of me wants to get some killing done.

1141
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:47,763
You want the head now.
sweetheart? So come down and get it.

1142
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,311
Brave lad.

1143
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:58,357
I couId've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now.

1144
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:02,319
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1145
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,030
You got the drop on me. love.

1146
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:07,616
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1147
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,543
I got to come clean with you.
sweetheart.

1148
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:22,298
It was an outright lie I was giving you
about me revolver being wet.

1149
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,092
You see. I'm not too fond of shooting.

1150
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,137
It's my preference to blow things up.

1151
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,307
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1152
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:34,226
and seen all the parts fIying off peopIe.

1153
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,189
a littIe bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1154
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:41,942
And here's me.
with all these fine grenades

1155
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,987
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1156
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:48,240
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.

1157
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,493
You killed me mates.

1158
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:53,162
Someone should have told you.

1159
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:56,248
never give an Irishman
good cause for revenge.

1160
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:59,585
Deadly little Miho.

1161
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:03,255
You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to.

1162
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,674
She twists the blade.

1163
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:08,093
He feels it.

1164
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:14,725
I tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it.

1165
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:16,894
I grab poor Dallas's car phone

1166
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:19,355
and make the most important call
of my life.

1167
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:23,859
First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill.

1168
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:27,238
The big, fat kill.

1169
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,460
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1170
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:43,796
What. are you kidding me. man?

1171
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:47,299
I couId watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it.

1172
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:48,801
I mean. the man's an artist.

1173
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:53,639
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1174
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:56,100
Your skin is perfect.

1175
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:59,019
Your nerves. responsive.

1176
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,479
Beautiful.

1177
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,940
Just give them what they want. Gail.

1178
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:10,406
-Becky?
-It's over. Gail.

1179
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:15,369
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1180
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:17,580
They got what's left
of that cop we killed.

1181
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,540
The mob's gonna turn it over
to the police chief.

1182
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:20,833
the cops are gonna mow us down.

1183
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,626
We gotta cut a deal.

1184
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:26,130
You littIe bitch. You sold us out.

1185
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:29,341
I didn't have no choice.
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1186
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,552
You gotta cut a deal with these people.

1187
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,804
It's selfish. you holding out like this.

1188
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:36,682
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1189
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:39,018
It wasn't your mom.

1190
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:42,021
We couId have protected her
and you know it.

1191
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,149
It was the money. you stupid little bitch.

1192
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:46,692
Sure. there's money.

1193
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,111
Sure. you couId've moved my mom
into Old Town

1194
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:51,822
and let her know that her daughter's
a goddamn whore.

1195
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,074
Breaks your heart. doesn't it?

1196
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:58,996
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me. a way out.

1197
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,081
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1198
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,750
Your neck.

1199
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:06,795
Your precious. scrawny. littIe neck!

1200
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:15,262
You're crazy. You could have
ripped my throat out. you crazy whore.

1201
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:20,351
Schutz. fetch my blades.

1202
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:24,605
-Stuka. kill this one.
-No. I was promised.

1203
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:27,399
Stupid little bitch. You deserve worse.

1204
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,569
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1205
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:33,822
Hey!

1206
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,662
Nobody. I don't see nobody.

1207
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:43,165
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys. Iook.

1208
01:22:43,249 --> 01:22:45,668
There's something wrapped around it.

1209
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:48,212
Some kind of note.

1210
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:49,922
Give it to me.

1211
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:53,467
It's poked right through me. Guys. look.

1212
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:57,763
-It's starting to really hurt

1213
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,306
Now, back everyone.
And bring the women.

1214
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:03,060
Do you think somebody
shouId call me a doctor or something?

1215
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:06,021
McCarthy. you fool.

1216
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:10,484
Guys?

1217
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:21,453
Dozens of them. armed to the teeth .

1218
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:25,416
I'm outnumbered, outgunned.

1219
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:30,713
But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow.

1220
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:33,507
They can't surround me.

1221
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,676
Sometimes, you can beat the odds

1222
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,429
with the careful choice
of where to fight.

1223
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:46,228
You can have Old Town. I don't care.

1224
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,564
Just give me the woman.

1225
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:52,443
Shut up.

1226
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:55,779
Dwight. don't do this.

1227
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,865
Hey. wait a minute.
Something's not right.

1228
01:23:57,949 --> 01:24:00,492
Shut up. or I'll plug you.

1229
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:03,996
Of course. Mr. McCarthy. A fair trade.

1230
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,165
She's all yours.

1231
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:19,636
Now. if you'll explain to me why we
shouldn't bIow both of you to pieces.

1232
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,182
Dwight. what have you done?

1233
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,434
Exactly what I had to.

1234
01:24:26,686 --> 01:24:29,021
Every step of the way.

1235
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:35,069
No. It isn't right.
There wasn't no tape over his mouth.

1236
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:37,780
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1237
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:52,044
where to fight counts for a lot.

1238
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:56,590
Cute trick. McCarthy.
but it will do you no good.

1239
01:24:56,758 --> 01:25:01,220
But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns.

1240
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:04,515
No! McCarthy. you shit!

1241
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:09,103
The girls all know the score.

1242
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:15,818
No escape, no surrender, no mercy.

1243
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,988
We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of them.

1244
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,199
Every last one.

1245
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:26,161
Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,

1246
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,790
not because it'll make
the world a better place.

1247
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:33,043
we need a heap of bloody bodies

1248
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:36,922
so when mob boss Wallenquist looks
over his charts of profits and losses,

1249
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:41,051
he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town.

1250
01:25:41,594 --> 01:25:44,638
The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing

1251
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:48,934
with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,

1252
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:52,146
and so am l .

1253
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:59,361
The fire, baby.

1254
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:01,697
It'll burn us both.

1255
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:06,118
There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire.

1256
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:10,414
my warrior woman , my Valkyrie.

1257
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:13,292
You'll always be mine.

1258
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:17,588
Always and never.

1259
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:33,145
Evening. officer.

1260
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:39,484
I don't have to introduce myseIf. do I?
You read the papers.

1261
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:42,988
This being an election year.
you've seen plenty of my picture.

1262
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,325
You know who I am and what I can do.

1263
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:49,161
And I'm doing you. Hartigan.

1264
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:51,747
Cold and hard. I'm doing you.

1265
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:54,833
You blew my son's ear off.

1266
01:26:56,336 --> 01:27:01,298
You bIew his arm off. You even
blew his nuts and his pecker off.

1267
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:07,387
He's in a coma right now.
They say he may never come out of it.

1268
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,722
My boy.

1269
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:10,390
He could've been the first Roark

1270
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,059
to become the President
of the United States.

1271
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:16,063
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged. dickless freak.

1272
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:20,025
Pulling that trigger
make you feel powerful?

1273
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:25,197
Power don't come
from a badge or a gun.

1274
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,492
Power comes from lying.

1275
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:33,247
Lying big. and getting the whole
damn world to play along with you.

1276
01:27:33,873 --> 01:27:35,165
Once you got everybody agreeing

1277
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:36,917
with what they know in their hearts
ain't true.

1278
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:39,419
you've got them by the balls.

1279
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:43,423
There's what.
maybe 500 peopIe in this hospital?

1280
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:51,390
I could pump you full of bullets right
now. and I wouIdn't even be arrested.

1281
01:27:51,474 --> 01:27:54,726
Everyone would lie for me.
everyone who counts.

1282
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:57,604
Otherwise. all their own lies.
everything that runs Sin City.

1283
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,816
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

1284
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:08,740
But I want you firm and fit and healthy.

1285
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:11,743
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

1286
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,746
Fix that heart condition of yours.

1287
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:18,959
You're gonna keep on living
a long time.

1288
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:20,877
I'm gonna make sure of that.

1289
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:27,217
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that littIe brat. and shooting my boy.

1290
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:29,761
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison.

1291
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:32,681
disgraced. destroyed.

1292
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:35,517
alone.

1293
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:38,437
Your wife?

1294
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:40,814
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

1295
01:28:40,898 --> 01:28:43,900
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

1296
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:47,821
They won't let me testify.

1297
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:51,908
I toId the cops that you saved my Iife
and they just acted like I was crazy.

1298
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:55,078
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

1299
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,622
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

1300
01:28:57,707 --> 01:29:00,292
I told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep.

1301
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:04,421
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

1302
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:08,759
I'm still a virgin. still aIive.
thanks to you.

1303
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:11,595
They got it all backwards.

1304
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:14,848
Sometimes. the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

1305
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:18,393
But you'll always
remember things. right.

1306
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:20,937
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

1307
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:26,943
But stay away. Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

1308
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,863
Don't visit me.

1309
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:31,698
Don't write me.

1310
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,408
Don't even say my name.

1311
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:38,538
Maybe you won't let me visit.
but I'll still write to you. Hartigan.

1312
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,041
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia."

1313
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:44,836
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

1314
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:48,673
I'll write you every week. for forever.

1315
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:51,176
Sure. kid.

1316
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:54,679
Now. run on home.

1317
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,848
It's not safe for you here.

1318
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,521
Bye. Nancy.

1319
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:07,692
I love you.

1320
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:18,745
John Hartigan.

1321
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:21,706
Mr. Law and Order.

1322
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:25,252
Mr. By the Book.

1323
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,547
Mr. High and Mighty.

1324
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:34,386
I gotta give you credit. being such a
straight arrow for so damn many years

1325
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,805
without it catching up with you.

1326
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:39,808
It's catching up with you now.
friend of mine.

1327
01:30:39,892 --> 01:30:42,227
It's catching up with you but good.

1328
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:50,235
Maybe I ought to look at him.
He doesn't look too good.

1329
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:53,738
He's hale and hearty. Tammy. See?

1330
01:30:55,658 --> 01:30:57,784
He's the picture of health.

1331
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,913
That Tammy. there.
she's fine. isn't she?

1332
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,916
I rented her out of Old Town.

1333
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:09,129
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of. not in prison.

1334
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,006
You hear me. Hartigan?

1335
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:14,468
If you stop being stupid.
start pIaying aIong with us.

1336
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:17,304
you might just get some of Tammy.

1337
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:20,599
You see that? She fIinched.

1338
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:23,727
You make her sick.

1339
01:31:23,936 --> 01:31:26,855
She heard about you and that littIe girl.

1340
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:28,607
This is nothing but a price i promised

1341
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,276
myself I'd pay, and I'm paying it.

1342
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,278
You don't save a little girl's life,

1343
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,780
then turn around
and throw her to the dogs.

1344
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:37,782
Not in my book, you don't.

1345
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:41,036
They want a confession .
They won't get it.

1346
01:31:44,415 --> 01:31:48,168
There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.

1347
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:51,713
She calls herself Cordelia.
just like she promised.

1348
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:55,467
She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away.

1349
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:58,428
At first, l figure
she'll send another note or two

1350
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:01,473
before her young mind
moves on to better things.

1351
01:32:01,807 --> 01:32:04,643
But every Thursday,
another one arrives.

1352
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:06,811
what a sweet kid.

1353
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:11,483
I do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when l reach for it.

1354
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:15,070
She's the only friend I've got,
the daughter I never had.

1355
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,031
My sweet Cordelia.

1356
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:20,784
Skinny little Nancy Callahan.

1357
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,788
Eight years pass.

1358
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,379
Then comes a Thursday
when I bound from my cot,

1359
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:34,506
excited as a kid at Christmas.

1360
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:38,176
only to find myself staring
at the damn floor of my damn cell,

1361
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:41,429
looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there.

1362
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:44,474
Then another Thursday with no letter.

1363
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,351
Is she all right?

1364
01:32:46,435 --> 01:32:48,853
Did something happen to her?

1365
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:50,230
Nothing.

1366
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,734
Two months now.
not a word from Nancy.

1367
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:58,321
Did they find her? Did they get to her?

1368
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:02,117
Of course. Stupid old man.

1369
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:05,537
Do your math . Nancy's 19 years old.

1370
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,582
How long did you expect her
to keep writing?

1371
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:11,835
She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did.

1372
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,879
She's forgotten you, old man.

1373
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:16,881
You're alone.

1374
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,384
You're all alone.

1375
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:31,313
This guy smells awful, like bad food.

1376
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:34,899
Like a corpse left in a garbage
dumpster in the middle of summer.

1377
01:33:34,942 --> 01:33:37,527
He stinks so bad, l want to throw up.

1378
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:51,041
Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard.

1379
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:53,752
when i come to. I see it.

1380
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:56,880
The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,

1381
01:33:57,381 --> 01:33:59,633
but there's no letter inside of it.

1382
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,676
There's something soft,

1383
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:06,139
something that ought to be alive,
a hunk of meat and bone

1384
01:34:06,223 --> 01:34:10,226
that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.

1385
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,395
How the hell did they find her?

1386
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,397
She was so careful.

1387
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,942
She never gave away
where she lives or where she works.

1388
01:34:22,281 --> 01:34:25,116
I've got to get out. l've got to help her.

1389
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:29,954
Nothing else matters,
not my life and not my pride, either.

1390
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:33,500
It's only one final surrender they want.

1391
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:36,294
You got me, Roark. You beat me.

1392
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:41,466
I say everything they want to hear,
just the way they want to hear it.

1393
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:45,053
I tell them l'm a twisted.
wretched child molester.

1394
01:34:45,137 --> 01:34:47,806
I agree to everything
they want from me.

1395
01:34:48,557 --> 01:34:50,225
I love you , Nancy.

1396
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:05,323
It's a lot of miIes into town. Hartigan.

1397
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:12,622
-You care for a ride?
-Long as you stay in front of me.

1398
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:16,459
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

1399
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:17,711
Christ.

1400
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:20,630
Eight years.

1401
01:35:22,007 --> 01:35:24,843
Yeah. Eight years.

1402
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:29,472
Well. if it's any consolation to you.

1403
01:35:31,517 --> 01:35:33,643
you made me hate myseIf.

1404
01:35:36,188 --> 01:35:38,815
-Any word from Eileen?
-Yeah.

1405
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:43,194
She got remarried four years ago.

1406
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:49,325
She had two kids. I'm sorry. John.

1407
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,036
Don't be.

1408
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:54,038
I'm glad.

1409
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,958
Eileen always wanted kids.

1410
01:35:58,085 --> 01:35:59,878
She'll make a good mother.

1411
01:36:02,214 --> 01:36:05,717
Like you said. Bob.
water under the bridge.

1412
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:20,732
Bob and I get on
with our fond farewells to each other.

1413
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,942
then I go looking
for the only human being on the planet

1414
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,944
who means a damn to me.

1415
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,404
Nancy.

1416
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:30,241
How could they have found out it was
you writing all those letters to me?

1417
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:32,744
How did they find out who you are?

1418
01:36:32,828 --> 01:36:35,413
And what have they done to you ,
baby?

1419
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:41,628
Not a sound.

1420
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:43,588
No sign of life.

1421
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:48,468
Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man ,

1422
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:52,096
like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?

1423
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:54,474
what has he done to Nancy?

1424
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:57,769
It's like all she ever does
is read and study and write.

1425
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:02,440
No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere.

1426
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:08,613
Closest thing to a clue is a pack
of matches from a lousy saloon .

1427
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:12,033
It's a long shot, but maybe she's got
some friends there.

1428
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,126
A dead-end.

1429
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:23,962
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do

1430
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:26,381
with a pack of drunks and losers
like this.

1431
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:28,633
But if there's anything
to be found here.

1432
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:30,301
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is

1433
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:33,638
or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her, this is the place.

1434
01:37:33,722 --> 01:37:36,975
Excuse me. Miss.
Wondering if you couId heIp me.

1435
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:38,643
I'm Iooking for somebody.

1436
01:37:38,727 --> 01:37:42,146
CoId night like this. everybody's
looking for somebody. stranger.

1437
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:44,983
It's not like that. Her name is Nancy.

1438
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:47,402
Eyes to the stage. pilgrim.

1439
01:37:47,486 --> 01:37:49,863
She's just warming up.

1440
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:01,833
Skinny little Nancy Callahan.

1441
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:03,751
She grew up.

1442
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:05,795
She filled out.

1443
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:10,174
Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.

1444
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:15,513
And here I was.
expecting a skinny little bookworm,

1445
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:18,182
maybe a bit too shy for her own good.

1446
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:24,022
How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years.

1447
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,779
How the hell did they find her?

1448
01:38:31,864 --> 01:38:33,489
Then it hits me.

1449
01:38:34,533 --> 01:38:36,534
They were bluffing.

1450
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:39,746
I've led them straight to her.

1451
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:50,965
She hasn't spotted you yet.

1452
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:54,677
Turn around and walk out the door.

1453
01:38:55,554 --> 01:38:57,388
Lead the creep outside.

1454
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:00,850
Get that Beretta away from him
somehow. and kill him.

1455
01:39:02,811 --> 01:39:06,064
I'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer.

1456
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:09,567
Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.

1457
01:39:10,486 --> 01:39:13,571
No, Nancy. Don't notice me.

1458
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:15,406
Don't recognize me.

1459
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:28,586
There's no time to explain.

1460
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:31,589
I've made a terrible mistake.
put you in terrible danger.

1461
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:33,841
We need to get out of here
right this second.

1462
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:37,470
Whatever you say. Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

1463
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:42,767
And here I'd figured
you'd forgotten all about me.

1464
01:39:42,851 --> 01:39:44,602
Me and my dumb letters.

1465
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:46,729
Kept me going.

1466
01:39:48,607 --> 01:39:50,692
Kept me from killing myseIf.

1467
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:54,570
Hurry up. will you?

1468
01:40:00,285 --> 01:40:02,912
Maybe I shouId drive.
Not a chance.

1469
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:06,791
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

1470
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:15,967
Besides. from the sound of things.
you might have to shoot somebody.

1471
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:18,720
-I don't have a gun.
-Under the seat.

1472
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:22,724
It's loaded and it works.

1473
01:40:24,643 --> 01:40:26,978
Yeah. this'll do.

1474
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:30,773
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

1475
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:38,823
Hartigan. there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

1476
01:40:40,325 --> 01:40:42,827
You've never been far
from my thoughts.

1477
01:40:42,911 --> 01:40:45,621
I've lain awake nights. thinking of you.

1478
01:40:46,498 --> 01:40:47,957
What are you talking about?

1479
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:53,504
Keep driving. Nancy. Keep driving
and keep the car on the road.

1480
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,177
She's counting on you, old man.

1481
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:01,012
What are you doing?

1482
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:03,389
Prove you're still worth a damn .

1483
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:12,023
Try and keep it on the road. Nancy!

1484
01:41:15,027 --> 01:41:16,569
He's a decent shot.

1485
01:41:16,653 --> 01:41:19,572
He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry.

1486
01:41:19,656 --> 01:41:22,533
Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.

1487
01:41:26,705 --> 01:41:28,748
He doesn't know how to take his time.

1488
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:31,918
Aim careful
and look the devil in the eye.

1489
01:41:40,552 --> 01:41:43,012
Stop the car. Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

1490
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:45,139
-What?
-Stop the car. now!

1491
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:47,892
Right. Stop the car. confirm the kill.

1492
01:41:54,691 --> 01:41:57,527
Sorry. I got a littIe rattled.

1493
01:41:57,569 --> 01:42:02,281
It's okay. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

1494
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:04,283
No. Let me stay close.

1495
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:07,078
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

1496
01:42:07,162 --> 01:42:10,581
PIease? Let me stay close.

1497
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:23,719
The stink. I almost gag.

1498
01:42:23,762 --> 01:42:25,721
His blood smells
even worse than he does.

1499
01:42:25,764 --> 01:42:26,764
Jesus.

1500
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:28,891
And it's all over the place.

1501
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:32,270
But the creep himself, he's gone.

1502
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:35,273
We're out of time.

1503
01:42:35,607 --> 01:42:39,610
The sirens.
I used to welcome the sound.

1504
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:43,447
There's nothing to do now but
find a place to hole up for the night,

1505
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:45,283
get Nancy calmed down ,
and figure out

1506
01:42:45,367 --> 01:42:47,326
what on Earth l'm going to do next.

1507
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:51,497
The stink, somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel.

1508
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:53,583
Nancy. I went to your apartment.

1509
01:42:53,625 --> 01:42:57,670
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

1510
01:42:57,754 --> 01:42:59,797
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

1511
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:03,843
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year.

1512
01:43:03,927 --> 01:43:07,305
I swore if I ever saw you again.
I'd show you I grew up strong.

1513
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:10,683
But there I was. just like before.
scared and helpless.

1514
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:13,978
-I'm such an asshole.
-You should sit down.

1515
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:17,815
You'll feeI a little bit better
if you sit down.

1516
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:21,068
I've never been
all that good with people.

1517
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:24,363
when it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19-year-old,

1518
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:28,326
I'm as expert as a palsy victim doing
brain surgery with a pipe wrench .

1519
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:30,995
It's aIways been you. Hartigan.

1520
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:33,456
All these years.

1521
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:37,001
It's just nerves
making you say that. Nancy.

1522
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:40,463
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

1523
01:43:40,505 --> 01:43:43,257
-Sleep with me.
-Stop it. Nancy.

1524
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:45,968
Eight years.

1525
01:43:46,261 --> 01:43:49,055
Why do you think
I keep writing you those letters?

1526
01:43:49,848 --> 01:43:51,974
It wasn't just gratitude.

1527
01:43:52,684 --> 01:43:55,019
I tried to faII in Iove with boys.

1528
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:57,521
Even thought I did once or twice.

1529
01:43:58,023 --> 01:44:02,068
But I was aIready in Iove with you.

1530
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:04,862
That's enough. Jesus Christ.

1531
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:06,989
I'm oId enough to be your grandfather.

1532
01:44:07,032 --> 01:44:09,533
-You're just scared.
-I'm not scared.

1533
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:12,036
No.

1534
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:50,574
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

1535
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:53,244
For God's sakes. you're just a kid.

1536
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:56,038
I Iove you.

1537
01:45:00,919 --> 01:45:03,087
I Iove you. too.

1538
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,256
With aII my heart.

1539
01:45:06,758 --> 01:45:09,927
Cold shower, it helps.

1540
01:45:10,012 --> 01:45:11,262
No. Nancy.

1541
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:17,184
Recognize my voice. Hartigan?

1542
01:45:17,269 --> 01:45:20,771
Recognize my voice.
you piece of shit cop?

1543
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:24,567
I Iook different.
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

1544
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:28,863
Sure. I recognize your voice. Junior.

1545
01:45:32,117 --> 01:45:34,702
Everything's gone straight to hell.

1546
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:37,371
l've been suckered
into betraying the only friend l've got,

1547
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:39,290
and put her in the hands
of a murdering rapist

1548
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:41,500
l thought l'd put down for good.

1549
01:45:41,585 --> 01:45:44,712
Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator.

1550
01:45:45,213 --> 01:45:47,298
lt's all gone to hell.

1551
01:45:47,382 --> 01:45:49,300
KIump. it's me.

1552
01:45:49,384 --> 01:45:51,635
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

1553
01:45:52,387 --> 01:45:54,347
I want you to set me up for a party.

1554
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:57,224
I've aIready got the girI. you dumb shit.

1555
01:45:57,309 --> 01:46:00,019
Hey. it better be perfect
or I'm caIIing my dad.

1556
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:02,313
My tooIs better be cIean and sharp.

1557
01:46:02,397 --> 01:46:05,024
It better be ready. It better be perfect.

1558
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:12,740
I get to do whatever I want.
however I want. whenever I want it.

1559
01:46:12,824 --> 01:46:16,327
My dad. I'd Iove him if I didn't hate him.

1560
01:46:16,411 --> 01:46:19,246
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the pIanet

1561
01:46:19,331 --> 01:46:22,541
to grow back that equipment
you bIew off from between my Iegs.

1562
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:26,587
just so the oId fart can hoId out some
kind of hope of having a grandkid.

1563
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:31,175
AIthough. as you can see.
there were some side effects.

1564
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:33,344
I'm not compIaining. though.
Since you've been gone.

1565
01:46:33,428 --> 01:46:35,137
I've been having the time of my Iife.

1566
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:38,432
And now you've Ied me back
to your darIing CordeIia.

1567
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:40,976
We aII wondered
who wrote aII those Ietters.

1568
01:46:41,019 --> 01:46:42,978
She Ieft not a cIue.

1569
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:47,858
CIever girI. And so pretty. so pretty.

1570
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:54,407
A IittIe oId for my taste.
but I can forgive that just this once.

1571
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:57,284
Nancy. don't scream.

1572
01:46:57,702 --> 01:47:00,204
Whatever he does to you.
don't scream.

1573
01:47:00,288 --> 01:47:01,872
She'II scream.

1574
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:04,625
I'm gonna take aII night
doing dear oId Nancy.

1575
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:08,045
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's aII your fauIt.

1576
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,423
They've aII screamed. Hartigan.

1577
01:47:11,216 --> 01:47:13,259
Dozens of them. maybe a hundred.

1578
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:17,221
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

1579
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:19,265
And if there weren't
so many peopIe hereabout.

1580
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:23,352
I wouId show you how I'm gonna make
dear oId Nancy scream.

1581
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:25,855
It's gonna be one heII of a show.

1582
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:38,367
This is it. No way to fight it now.

1583
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:40,494
No hope left.

1584
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,371
No chance.

1585
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:46,667
This is it. This is the end.

1586
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:50,212
No.

1587
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:55,301
Give it a shot. old man.
Keep your neck tight. Move.

1588
01:47:55,385 --> 01:47:59,096
The window, maybe there's an alarm.
The window.

1589
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:02,099
Keep your neck tight, God damn it.
Stay conscious.

1590
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:04,018
Stay conscious.

1591
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:06,228
No alarm.

1592
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:08,522
The glass. Cut the rope.

1593
01:48:09,107 --> 01:48:11,942
You can do it. You can do it.

1594
01:48:11,985 --> 01:48:13,777
It is incIement upon me

1595
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:18,115
to comment with marked dispIeasure
on your rash impuIsiveness

1596
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:24,622
in seIecting such an eye-catching
and impracticaI car to heist. Mr. ShIubb.

1597
01:48:24,956 --> 01:48:28,626
IrreIevant to said mission
is the foIIowing query.

1598
01:48:28,668 --> 01:48:30,628
which I now put forth to you.

1599
01:48:31,254 --> 01:48:37,134
Wherein this most streamIined
and trunkIess of transports.

1600
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:39,637
boner-inspiring though it may be.

1601
01:48:39,721 --> 01:48:44,475
wherein are we to reposit
our recentIy deceased cargo?

1602
01:48:47,979 --> 01:48:51,565
I can onIy express puzzIement
that borders on aIarm.

1603
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:59,657
TeII me where Roark takes the girIs
or I'II cut your damn head off.

1604
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,325
In pIain EngIish. creep.

1605
01:49:01,409 --> 01:49:05,454
The answer you seek is ruraI.
even agrarian.

1606
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,165
The farm.

1607
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:11,168
That's aII I need to hear.

1608
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:14,004
Every cop on the force
knows about the Roark family's farm

1609
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:16,131
and to stay away from it.

1610
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:19,176
Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal.

1611
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:22,179
Once things get loud,
l'll probably have use for the cannons.

1612
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:24,765
But at first, l'll have to play it quiet.

1613
01:49:25,183 --> 01:49:26,976
Quiet and nasty.

1614
01:49:28,061 --> 01:49:31,355
Nancy's car, six miles from the farm.

1615
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:34,775
"Nobody but me can keep
this heap running" , she told me.

1616
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:36,485
Good girl.

1617
01:49:36,695 --> 01:49:38,529
The car stalled out
on that yellow bastard

1618
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:40,698
and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again .

1619
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:44,535
You kept your mouth shut.
l'll bet Junior was furious.

1620
01:49:44,953 --> 01:49:47,538
l'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.

1621
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:51,208
But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes.

1622
01:49:51,876 --> 01:49:53,877
There's still a chance, Nancy.

1623
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,546
Don't scream.

1624
01:49:56,965 --> 01:49:58,799
l ditch the car a mile or so
from the farm

1625
01:49:58,883 --> 01:50:00,884
and make my way through the woods.

1626
01:50:00,969 --> 01:50:03,220
l'm not halfway there when it hits.

1627
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:08,726
My heart. Can't be my heart.

1628
01:50:09,227 --> 01:50:10,686
l was cured.

1629
01:50:11,896 --> 01:50:14,815
Bad cough , blood in it.

1630
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,026
Doesn't matter now.

1631
01:50:17,068 --> 01:50:20,321
l don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway.

1632
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:28,120
Rotten way to kill a man , but it's quiet.

1633
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:35,336
Hate yourself later.

1634
01:50:47,849 --> 01:50:50,142
You're onIy
making this worse for yourseIf.

1635
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:51,310
you stupid cow!

1636
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:02,613
Do you think I'm tired?

1637
01:51:02,697 --> 01:51:04,782
Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

1638
01:51:04,866 --> 01:51:07,326
You're the one who's gonna crack.

1639
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:09,328
You'II crack.

1640
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:12,331
You'II cry and beg.

1641
01:51:12,707 --> 01:51:14,333
You'II scream.

1642
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:18,545
Oh. yeah. you'II scream.
you big. fat. ugIy cow!

1643
01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:20,798
You'II scream.

1644
01:51:26,596 --> 01:51:29,431
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I couId do?

1645
01:51:29,516 --> 01:51:31,266
That was forepIay.

1646
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:35,145
Hartigan was right about you.

1647
01:51:36,314 --> 01:51:38,691
You can't get it up unIess I scream.

1648
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:45,364
You're pathetic.

1649
01:51:47,784 --> 01:51:50,577
It's not wise at aII
to make fun of me Iike that.

1650
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:54,832
It brings out the worst in me.

1651
01:52:01,548 --> 01:52:03,257
Stupid old man.

1652
01:52:03,341 --> 01:52:05,259
ln too much of a hurry.

1653
01:52:06,845 --> 01:52:10,013
Damn. It can't be.

1654
01:52:10,515 --> 01:52:13,851
Charging in like Galahad,
just like l told myself l wouldn't!

1655
01:52:14,018 --> 01:52:15,602
Stupid old man.

1656
01:52:15,687 --> 01:52:16,812
You tagged him good.

1657
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:19,732
Don't take no chances.
Perforate the fooI.

1658
01:52:24,279 --> 01:52:26,029
Good advice.

1659
01:52:36,541 --> 01:52:38,542
Give it up. Junior.

1660
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:40,836
It's over. Let her go.

1661
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:42,880
You're dreaming. Hartigan.

1662
01:52:42,964 --> 01:52:45,090
I get to see your eyes whiIe I fiIIet

1663
01:52:45,175 --> 01:52:47,593
the woman of your dreams
right in front of you.

1664
01:52:47,677 --> 01:52:51,013
Look at you. You're about to keeI over.

1665
01:52:51,055 --> 01:52:53,265
You can't even Iift that cannon.

1666
01:52:53,558 --> 01:52:55,267
Sure. I can.

1667
01:53:03,067 --> 01:53:05,819
You gave me a scare there
for a second. oId man.

1668
01:53:05,904 --> 01:53:09,239
Nancy. I'm sorry.

1669
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:11,825
I'm taking no chances with you.

1670
01:53:14,746 --> 01:53:18,582
First I soften you up.
and then it's showtime.

1671
01:53:21,586 --> 01:53:23,420
Here it comes.

1672
01:53:25,423 --> 01:53:26,840
It's gonna hurt.

1673
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:29,426
You're right about that.

1674
01:53:33,264 --> 01:53:34,932
Sucker.

1675
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:40,270
l take away his weapon .

1676
01:53:42,315 --> 01:53:43,690
Both of them.

1677
01:53:55,286 --> 01:54:00,040
Eight Iong years. son of a bitch !

1678
01:54:00,124 --> 01:54:01,959
After a while, all l'm doing is pounding

1679
01:54:02,043 --> 01:54:05,712
wet chunks of bone
into the floorboards, so l stop.

1680
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:08,632
So Iong. Junior.

1681
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:11,301
Been a pIeasure.

1682
01:54:17,433 --> 01:54:21,103
I didn't scream. Hartigan. not once.

1683
01:54:22,355 --> 01:54:23,730
I didn't scream.

1684
01:54:23,815 --> 01:54:25,607
I know it. baby.

1685
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:28,443
You grew up strong.

1686
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:43,375
By the time l get her to the car,
Nancy stops shaking.

1687
01:54:43,459 --> 01:54:47,421
Her skin is warm again .
She's herself again.

1688
01:54:47,505 --> 01:54:49,715
Thanks for remembering my coat.

1689
01:54:51,342 --> 01:54:53,343
And for aII the IittIe things.

1690
01:54:54,012 --> 01:54:57,389
Like saving my Iife. twice.

1691
01:54:58,349 --> 01:55:01,602
-You better get roIIing.
-You're not coming aIong?

1692
01:55:01,686 --> 01:55:06,565
No. I have friends on their way.
to coIIect evidence.

1693
01:55:06,649 --> 01:55:09,276
I'm gonna bIow
this whoIe sick mess wide open.

1694
01:55:09,527 --> 01:55:11,194
I'm gonna cIear my name.

1695
01:55:11,821 --> 01:55:15,073
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he beIongs.

1696
01:55:16,034 --> 01:55:19,244
I can't Iose you. not again.

1697
01:55:22,123 --> 01:55:24,291
You'II never Iose me. Nancy.

1698
01:55:37,847 --> 01:55:41,808
Nancy Callahan, the love of my life.

1699
01:55:43,061 --> 01:55:47,356
Shame to lie to her.
l hope she forgives me for it.

1700
01:55:47,398 --> 01:55:51,109
Get Senator Roark behind bars? Sure.

1701
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:52,986
And maybe after
l've pulled off that miracle,

1702
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:54,905
l'll go and punch out God.

1703
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:58,659
There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark.

1704
01:55:58,743 --> 01:56:00,327
l killed his only son .

1705
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:03,163
The bloodline is cut.

1706
01:56:03,247 --> 01:56:05,916
Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.

1707
01:56:06,125 --> 01:56:08,919
He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me.

1708
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:12,798
He'll go after me through Nancy.
He'll find her again .

1709
01:56:12,882 --> 01:56:14,758
There'll be no end to it.

1710
01:56:15,176 --> 01:56:16,927
She'll never be safe.

1711
01:56:17,595 --> 01:56:19,346
Not as long as l'm alive.

1712
01:56:20,139 --> 01:56:22,641
There's only one way to beat him.

1713
01:56:23,434 --> 01:56:25,102
An old man dies.

1714
01:56:26,187 --> 01:56:27,980
a young woman lives.

1715
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:30,649
Fair trade.

1716
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:36,613
l love you , Nancy.

1717
01:56:42,161 --> 01:56:43,161
Uh-huh.

1718
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:46,289
Yes.

1719
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:49,001
Mom. don't go on Iike that.

1720
01:56:49,085 --> 01:56:53,296
It's not the city. I couId've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

1721
01:56:54,465 --> 01:56:57,968
Yeah. just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a cIean break.

1722
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:00,345
It shouId be right as rain in no time.

1723
01:57:04,267 --> 01:57:05,267
Uh-huh.

1724
01:57:14,736 --> 01:57:15,736
Mmm-hmm.

1725
01:57:19,782 --> 01:57:22,284
Turn the right corner in Sin City

1726
01:57:23,202 --> 01:57:26,455
and you can find anything.

1727
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:28,874
Becky.

1728
01:57:31,502 --> 01:57:33,211
Care for a smoke?

1729
01:57:36,215 --> 01:57:38,008
Love you. too. Mom.

1730
01:57:40,595 --> 01:57:41,845
Anything.
