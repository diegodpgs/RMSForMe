1
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,790
You keep your work station
so clean, Jerome.

2
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,850
It's next to godliness.

3
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,420
- Isn't that what they say?
- "Godliness."

4
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,260
I reviewed your flight plan.
Not one error in a million keystrokes.

5
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,770
Phenomenal. It's right that
someone like you...

6
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,600
is taking us to Titan.

7
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,700
Has the committee
approved the mission?

8
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,540
There's been talk of delay.

9
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,010
You shouldn't listen to talk.

10
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,570
You leave in a week.

11
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,350
You've got a substance test.

12
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,750
If you have been notified
for substance analysis...

13
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,950
please report
to the testing center.

14
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,230
Never shy.
Pisses on command.

15
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,730
I ever tell you that's
a beautiful piece of equipment?

16
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,430
Every time I'm here.

17
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,340
Occupational hazard.

18
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,070
I see many in the course of any day.

19
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,440
Yours happens to be
an exceptional example.

20
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,120
I don't know why my folks
didn't order one like that for me.

21
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,960
By the way...

22
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,510
have I told you about my son?

23
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,670
- No, you haven't.
- Remind me to sometime.

24
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,510
So you're about to go up.

25
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,980
One week left.

26
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,980
Please tell me you're excited.

27
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,710
I'll tell you
at the end of the week.

28
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,040
Congratulations, Jerome.

29
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,140
Thank you.

30
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,480
How many launches are there
in a day? A dozen?

31
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,690
Sometimes more.

32
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,390
You're the only one
who watches them all.

33
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,790
If you're going to pretend
like you don't care, don't look up.

34
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,360
The most unremarkable
of events.

35
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,070
Jerome Morrow,
navigator first class...

36
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,870
is about to embark on a one-year
manned mission to Titan...

37
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,970
the 14th moon of Saturn.

38
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,050
A highly prestigious assignment.
Although for Jerome...

39
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,610
selection was
virtually guaranteed at birth.

40
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,260
He's blessed with all the gifts
required for such an undertaking.

41
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,820
A genetic quotient
second to none.

42
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,290
No, there is truly
nothing remarkable...

43
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,460
about the progress
of Jerome Morrow.

44
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,730
Except that
I am not Jerome Morrow.

45
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,480
I was conceived
in the Riviera.

46
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,990
Not the French Riviera,
the Detroit variety.

47
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,010
They used to say that
a child conceived in love...

48
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,220
has a greater chance of happiness.

49
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,300
They don't say that anymore.

50
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,090
I'll never understand what possessed
my mother to put her faith...

51
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,230
in God's hands rather than
those of her local geneticist.

52
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,840
Ten fingers, ten toes.
That's all that used to matter.

53
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,510
Not now.
Now, only seconds old...

54
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,610
the exact time and cause
of my death was already know.

55
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,720
Neurological condition:
60% probability.

56
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,390
Manic depression:
42% probability.

57
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,370
Attention deficit disorder:
89% probability.

58
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,400
Heart disorder--

59
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,660
99% probability.

60
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,670
Early fatal potential.

61
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,870
Life expectancy: 30.2 years.

62
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,410
Thirty years.

63
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,310
The name?

64
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,010
- Anton.
- No!

65
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,020
Vincent Anton.

66
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,120
Yeah. That's a good name.

67
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,160
I know he'll do something.

68
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,370
From an early age I came to think
of myself as others thought of me.

69
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,380
Chronically ill.
Every skinned knee and runny nose...

70
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,780
was treated like
it was life-threatening.

71
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,370
I'm sorry.
The insurance won't cover it.

72
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,580
- If he fell--
- I was told everything--

73
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,210
I wish there was
something I could do.

74
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,600
Like most parents of their day...

75
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,660
they were determined that
their next child would be born...

76
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,570
in what has become
the natural way.

77
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,770
Your extracted eggs, Marie...

78
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,980
have been fertilized
with Antonio's sperm.

79
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,650
After screening, we are
left with two healthy boys...

80
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,880
and two very healthy girls.

81
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,260
Naturally, no critical predispositions
to any major inheritable diseases.

82
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,460
All that remains is to select
the most compatible candidate.

83
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,220
First, we let's decide on gender.
Have you given it any thought?

84
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,500
We would want Vincent
to have a brother, you know...

85
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,560
to play with.

86
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,800
Of course.
Hello, Vincent.

87
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,150
You have specified hazel eyes,
dark hair and fair skin.

88
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,250
I've taken the liberty of eradicating
any potentially prejudicial conditions.

89
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
Premature baldness, myopia...

90
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,920
alcoholism and
addictive susceptibility...

91
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,960
propensity for violence,
obesity, etc.

92
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,760
We didn't want--
Diseases, yes, but--

93
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,600
We were just wondering if it's good
to leave a few things to chance?

94
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,040
You want to give your child
the best possible start.

95
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,630
Believe me, we have enough
imperfection built in already.

96
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,510
Your child doesn't need
any additional burdens.

97
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,840
Keep in mind
this child is still you.

98
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,180
Simply the best of you.

99
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,750
You could conceive naturally a thousand
times and never get such a result.

100
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,720
That's how my brother, Anton,
came into the world.

101
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,890
A son my father considered
worthy of his name.

102
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,380
What did I tell you?
See how he's grown?

103
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,030
By the time we were
playing at blood brothers...

104
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,260
I understood that there was something
different flowing through my veins...

105
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,740
and I'd need
more than a drop...

106
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,740
if I was going to get anywhere.

107
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,760
Our favorite game was chicken.

108
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,200
When our parents weren't watching,
we'd swim out as far as we dared.

109
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,900
It was about who would get scared
and turn back first.

110
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,820
Come on, you coward!

111
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,980
Of course,
it was always me.

112
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,590
Anton was by far
the stronger swimmer...

113
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,820
and he had no excuse
to fail.

114
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,140
Maybe it was the love of the planets...

115
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,180
or my growing dislike for this one.

116
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,270
But for as long as I can remember,
I have dreamed of going into space.

117
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,750
700 million. 750 million.
800 million.

118
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,480
850 million.

119
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,320
How many astronauts are there?

120
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,690
I bet I could be one
if I wanted.

121
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,230
Don't eat that.
It's Pluto.

122
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,970
My goals didn't change a lot
in the intervening years...

123
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,600
much to my parents' dismay.

124
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,820
You have to be realistic.
With your heart condition--

125
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,850
Mom, there's a chance there's
nothing wrong with my heart.

126
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,090
One in a hundred.

127
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,790
- I'll take it.
- The trouble is, they won't.

128
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,730
Listen. For God's sake...

129
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,740
you gotta understand something.

130
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,900
The only way you'll see the inside
of a spaceship is to clean it.

131
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,810
My father was right.

132
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,580
It didn't matter how much
I lied on my resume.

133
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,590
My real resume
was in my cells.

134
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,960
Why should anybody invest
all that money to train me...

135
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,490
when there are a thousand other
applicants with a far cleaner profile?

136
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,120
Of course, it's illegal
to discriminate.

137
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,400
"Genoism," it's called.

138
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,270
But no one
takes the law seriously.

139
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,350
If you refuse to disclose...

140
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,710
they can always take a sample
from a door handle or a handshake...

141
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,780
even the saliva
on your application form.

142
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,920
If in doubt, a legal drug test
can just as easily become...

143
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,220
an illegal peek
at your future in the company.

144
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,340
You sure you wanna do this?
You know you're gonna lose.

145
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,550
It was the last time
we swam together...

146
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,650
and out into the open sea...

147
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,690
like always, knowing each stroke
to the horizon...

148
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,700
was one we'd have to
make back to the shore.

149
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,210
But something was very different
about that day.

150
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,340
Every time Anton
tried to pull away...

151
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,680
he found me right beside him.

152
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,350
Until finally,
the impossible happened.

153
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,470
It was the one moment
in our lives that my brother...

154
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,810
was not as strong as he believed
and I was not as weak.

155
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,880
It was the moment that made
everything else possible.

156
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,020
Like many in my situation...

157
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,500
I moved around in the next few years,
getting work where I could.

158
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,460
I must've cleaned
half the toilets in the state.

159
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,900
I belonged to a new underclass...

160
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,540
no longer determined
by social status or skin color.

161
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,180
- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- No.

162
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,450
We now have discrimination
down to a science.

163
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,750
There's your cleaning material.

164
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,290
Start from the front,
clean all the way back.

165
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,430
And I wanna see my smiling face
on that floor.

166
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,300
What about you, Your Majesty?
You dreaming of space?

167
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,780
Come here.

168
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,820
You can start by
cleaning this space right here.

169
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,680
I was never more certain of
how far away I was from my goal...

170
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,990
than when I was
standing right beside it.

171
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,770
When you clean the glass,
don't clean it too well.

172
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,630
What do you mean?

173
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,170
You might get ideas.

174
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,230
But if it's clean, it'll be easier to
see me when I'm on the other side of it.

175
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,720
For all my brave talk,
I knew it was just that.

176
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,700
No matter how much I trained
or how much I studied...

177
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,100
the best test score wouldn't matter
without the blood test to go with it.

178
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,740
I made up my mind to resort
to more extreme measures.

179
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,040
The man who
showed up at my doorstep...

180
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,880
didn't exactly advertise
in the Yellow Pages.

181
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,890
Stand straight.

182
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,150
- How did you hear about me?
- People.

183
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,460
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birthmarks?

184
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,470
No. I don't think so.

185
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,560
You're serious about this?
I hope you're not wasting my time.

186
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,070
No, I'd give 100%.

187
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,300
That'll get you halfway there.

188
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,580
That's an old edition,
but I know it all by heart.

189
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,380
By heart?

190
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,860
You realize the commitment
is binding.

191
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,590
You have somebody?

192
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,210
For the genetically superior,
success is easier to attain...

193
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,250
but is by no means guaranteed.

194
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,520
After all, there is no gene for fate.

195
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,890
And when,
for one reason or another...

196
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,950
a member of the elite
falls on hard times...

197
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,690
their genetic identity becomes a
valued commodity for the unscrupulous.

198
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,430
One man's loss is another man's gain.

199
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,470
His credentials are impeccable.

200
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,560
An expiration date
you wouldn't believe.

201
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,480
The guy's practically
gonna live for ever.

202
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,350
He's got an I.Q. off the register.

203
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,150
Better than 20/20 in both eyes.

204
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,280
And the heart of an ox.
He could run through a wall.

205
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,600
If he could still run.

206
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,530
Actually, he was
a big-time swimming star.

207
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,200
You could go anywhere with this guy's
helix tucked under your arm.

208
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,450
What did I tell you? You look so right
together I wanna double my fee.

209
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,010
- We don't look anything alike.
- It's close enough.

210
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,390
When was the last time anybody
looked at a photograph?

211
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,320
You could have my face on your name tag,
for Christ's sake.

212
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,620
- How do I explain the accident?
- That's the beautiful thing.

213
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,030
It happened out of the country.

214
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,560
There's no record he broke his back.
As far as anyone's concerned...

215
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,160
he's still a walking, talking,
fully-productive member of society.

216
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,540
You just have to get him clean
and fill in the last year of his life.

217
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,110
You're a foreigner.

218
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,080
They don't care
where you were born, just how.

219
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,980
Blood has no nationality.

220
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,540
As long as it's got
what they're looking for...

221
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,680
it's the only passport you need.

222
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,990
Who lives up there?

223
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,430
I certainly don't.

224
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,230
So began the process
of becoming Jerome.

225
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,860
Myopia is one of the most obvious
signs of a disadvantaged birth.

226
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,910
Isn't there another way?

227
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,880
Surgery's no good.
They'll see the scars.

228
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,810
It's contact lenses or a white cane.

229
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,950
Besides, the color doesn't match.

230
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,010
He's right.
My eyes are prettier.

231
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,460
You understand
I take 25% of everything you make.

232
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:06,830
If it doesn't work out, this equipment
must be returned within seven days.

233
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,160
And you don't get your deposit back.

234
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,360
- I thought you said 20%.
- He told me 20%.

235
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,430
- Twenty percent.
- It's not negotiable.

236
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,010
I guess that's it.

237
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,050
Not quite.

238
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,960
- Why? What?
- There's still the matter of height.

239
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,260
- How tall are you?
- 4'6".

240
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,320
How tall were you
before the accident?

241
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,600
Unfortunately,
his profile says he's 6'1".

242
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,460
I'll wear lifts.

243
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,570
Even with lifts,
you're not that tall.

244
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,150
So, what?

245
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,490
We never discussed that.

246
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,530
I thought you were serious.

247
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,960
I am. I'm not doing that.

248
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,100
I won't.

249
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,410
Jerome never
questioned my commitment again.

250
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
I took my mind off the pain
by reminding myself...

251
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:39,390
that when I eventually did stand up
I'd be two inches closer to the stars.

252
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,890
You all right?

253
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,900
Yeah.

254
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,330
Wanna go dancing?

255
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,570
You had to be a right-hander.

256
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,370
I guess no one orders
southpaws anymore.

257
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,840
Jerome Morrow.

258
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,080
It's a nice name.

259
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,720
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.

260
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,190
What makes you think
you can be me at all?

261
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,770
Look at this.

262
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,100
Look at it.

263
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,810
It's nice.

264
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,840
I'm impressed. Is it real?

265
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,310
Are you colorblind too?

266
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,080
- It's silver.
- So?

267
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,210
Jerome Morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium.

268
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,790
With all I had going for me...

269
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,690
I was still second best.

270
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,000
Me.

271
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,660
So how do you expect
to pull this off?

272
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,870
I don't know exactly.

273
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,310
Your signature needs work.

274
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,610
It soon came time to put
our preparations to the test.

275
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,450
Jerome was engineered with everything
needed to get into Gattaca...

276
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,490
except the desire to do so.

277
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,490
Do you really wanna be in there?

278
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,960
I don't wanna be in there.
I wanna be up there.

279
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,260
What's up there?

280
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,600
That's what I wanna find out, Jerome.

281
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,940
Call me Eugene.

282
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,880
My middle name.

283
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,150
If you're gonna be Jerome,
you better start getting used to it.

284
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,490
Where's my sample?

285
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,620
In the refrigerator!
Door on the left!

286
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,930
Which pouch?

287
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,630
Oh, any of them.

288
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,640
Should I test it?

289
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,640
If you like!

290
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,140
- What's wrong with the machine?
- Nothing!

291
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,350
It's a hot sample.
You've been drinking again.

292
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,910
- I haven't!
- Christ, it's 8:00 in the morning!

293
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,520
I haven't!

294
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,590
This is no joke!
My interview is in an hour!

295
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,380
There is more vodka in this piss
than there is piss!

296
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,350
I'm sorry.
I had half a glass to celebrate.

297
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,250
Try Friday's.
That one will be okay.

298
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,780
- There's only Wednesday left.
- That's the one.

299
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,300
Listen. It's not too late
to back out.

300
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,640
This is the last day you're gonna be you
and I'm gonna be me.

301
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,310
Well?

302
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,910
Congratulations.

303
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,550
Well, what about the interview?

304
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,020
That was it.

305
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,390
I got it.

306
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,270
Of course you got it.

307
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,170
And that's the way it was.

308
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,180
Daily, I disposed of as much loose skin,
fingernails and hair as possible...

309
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,450
to limit how much of my In-Valid self
I would leave in the Valid world.

310
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,400
Meanwhile, Eugene prepared samples of
his own superior body matter...

311
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,440
so that I might pass for him.

312
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,910
Customized urine pouches
for the frequent substance tests...

313
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,910
fingertip blood sachets
for security checks...

314
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,670
vials filled with other traces.

315
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,050
While Eugene supplied me
with a new identity, I paid the rent...

316
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,520
and kept him in the style
to which he'd become accustomed.

317
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,380
Eugene never suffered from the routine
discrimination of a "utero"...

318
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,490
"faith birth" or "In-Valid"
as we were called.

319
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,900
A "Valid," a "vitro," a "made man,"
he suffered under a different burden.

320
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,600
The burden of perfection.

321
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,000
I was now a member
of a relatively new...

322
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,480
and particularly detested
segment of society.

323
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,170
One of those who refuses
to play the hand that he was dealt.

324
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,310
I am most commonly known
as a "borrowed ladder" or...

325
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,250
a "de-gene-erate."

326
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,130
In the guise of Jerome Morrow...

327
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,930
I have risen quickly
through the ranks of Gattaca.

328
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,470
Only one of the mission directors
has ever come close...

329
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,330
to discovering my true identity.

330
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,100
Strange to think, he may have more
success exposing me in death...

331
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,010
than he ever did in life.

332
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,360
We apologize for any inconvenience.

333
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,300
- I think we can rule out suicide.
- Excuse me?

334
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,300
Nothing.

335
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,740
Thank you.

336
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,240
This will take a while.
We might have to push things back.

337
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:00,530
Irene, I want you to
assist the investigators.

338
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,630
My work, Director.
That would put me behind.

339
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,730
I appreciate your sacrifice.

340
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,310
Will you see that
I don't lose my place in line?

341
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,810
Your place is assured.

342
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,370
So, will you kindly inform
the authorities...

343
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,750
that we will cooperate
in any way...

344
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,180
although we can't tolerate
a major disruption.

345
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,310
- Director--
- Thank you.

346
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,080
Thank you.

347
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,030
How will this affect the mission?

348
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,230
We're still going ahead
as planned.

349
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,130
The launch window's only open
until week's end...

350
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,110
and tragic though
this event may be...

351
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:45,300
it hasn't stopped
the planets' turning, has it?

352
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,750
- What happened?
- I'm going up.

353
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,460
When?

354
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,590
End of the week.

355
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,090
That soon?

356
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,930
What about the mission director?

357
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,090
He's dead.

358
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,500
Are you serious?

359
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,180
He was found in his office today beaten
so badly they had to check his name tag.

360
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,350
You are serious.

361
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,480
So that's it.

362
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,790
There's nothing between us
and ignition.

363
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,360
I'm going up.

364
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,490
- The man was murdered.
- So? I didn't do it.

365
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,830
I didn't say you did, but the place
is gonna be crawling with Hoovers.

366
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,530
I'll take my chances with the
"J.Edgars" over the mission director.

367
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:52,370
Besides, what if they do find something?
I'll be out of their jurisdiction.

368
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,310
We have to get drunk immediately.

369
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,460
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- I hope our table's ready.

370
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,560
- I understand you're leaving us.
- Looks that way.

371
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,260
- We're going to miss you.
- You've opened the wine, I hope?

372
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,830
- Of course, sir.
- Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish.

373
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,030
Thank you, sir.

374
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,860
How old?

375
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,870
- Me?
- The specimen.

376
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,870
I kissed him five minutes ago.
A real good one.

377
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,570
I'll see what I can do.

378
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,270
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.

379
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,410
Thank you.

380
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,980
Good luck.

381
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:19,060
Some samples may be consumed
in the sequencing process.

382
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,330
9.3. Quite a catch.

383
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,270
Yes. Quite a catch.

384
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,400
How many times have I told Cavendish?

385
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,770
This can't have been opened
more than five minutes ago!

386
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,540
A wine like this needs to breathe.
Remember that.

387
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,210
You know, they say
when you're weightless...

388
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,380
it's the closest thing
to being in the womb.

389
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,620
I can't believe
you pulled this off.

390
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,160
They're sending you up there.

391
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,720
Up there, for Christ's sake.
You, of all people.

392
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,090
I hate to think of you
alone in that room for a year.

393
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,330
Don't think about it.
Anyway...

394
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,200
the room I'm stuck in
is bigger than your tin can.

395
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,530
You know what I'm saying.
What are you gonna do?

396
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,330
I have my books.
I go places in my head.

397
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,200
- I'd be happier if you had company.
- I have visitors!

398
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,050
- None that you don't pay.
- I wouldn't have it any other way.

399
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,750
Seriously,
what are you gonna do?

400
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,950
I'm gonna finish this.

401
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,930
What's Titan like
this time of year?

402
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,110
What's Titan like?

403
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,840
Titan is exactly like this.

404
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,990
All the time.

405
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,290
It's got a cloud around it so thick
nobody can tell what's underneath.

406
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,100
Maybe there's nothing there.

407
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,400
There's something there.

408
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,910
You should be going
instead of me.

409
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,550
Why?

410
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,120
Because up there
your legs wouldn't matter.

411
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,130
I'm scared of heights.

412
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,820
I'm sorry!

413
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,690
Do you want this?
I'll save some for you, shall I?

414
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,100
- I'm really sorry.
- You're not that sorry.

415
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,830
Don't give me a hard time.
Give me a break.

416
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,380
Come on!

417
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,940
- I'm sorry.
- Help!

418
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,190
I wasn't drunk.

419
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,160
- What do you mean?
- When I walked in front of that car.

420
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,560
What car?

421
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,930
I stepped right out
in front of it.

422
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,700
I'd never been more sober
in my life.

423
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,510
- Go to sleep.
- Couldn't even get that right.

424
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,410
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again."

425
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,420
Go to sleep.

426
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,660
I'm proud of you, Vincent.

427
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,290
You must be drunk
to call me Vincent.

428
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,140
- How much do you need?
- Twenty minutes.

429
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,100
You can go.

430
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,180
It's all right, Irene.
You're excused.

431
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,870
We found our man. It's the only
specimen we can't account for.

432
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,000
Every ten years or so,
things go our way.

433
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,570
The eyelash?
What do you know about him?

434
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,770
He's an unregistered In-Valid.

435
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,280
He was a janitor here until
a few years back when he disappeared.

436
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,610
So the specimen could have
been here since then.

437
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,490
Take a look at the floor.
Nothing lays around here for very long.

438
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,190
And motive? Would a janitor come back
to kill a man he never knew?

439
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,730
His profile does suggest
a violent temperament.

440
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,290
If I'm not mistaken, it also
suggests that he's a sick man.

441
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:07,240
There's a 90% chance the owner of this
eyelash has died of natural causes.

442
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:11,270
Then there's a ten percent chance he's
alive. It's a lost-and-found case, sir.

443
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,940
We find the man who's lost an eyelash,
we have the murderer.

444
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,140
I'll do a cross check,
find out about his family--

445
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,810
I've already run it. There's no record
of any living relative.

446
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,320
That's a damn shame, sir.

447
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:26,190
Check the entry log,
alibis, grudges.

448
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,190
I look around,
I see a lot of dry eyes.

449
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,160
The mission director
was not universally loved.

450
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,120
He was leading the cutbacks
in the program.

451
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,100
With all due respect, sir--

452
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,570
Whatever you say.

453
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,860
Jerome, Jerome,
the metronome.

454
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,120
I could play the piano
by that heartbeat of his.

455
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,000
Mr.Director, you will be pleased
to know we have a suspect.

456
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,200
That is a relief.
Who is it?

457
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:18,070
We found an unaccounted for specimen
in the south wing. Here's his picture.

458
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:23,310
- An In-Valid.
- We are still following other leads.

459
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,010
Be that as it may,
I'm having this posted immediately.

460
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:27,980
I'm curious.

461
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,910
An advantage, I should imagine,
in your line of work.

462
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,590
Your hiring practices.

463
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,190
Our recruitment philosophy.

464
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,430
Who do you have to be
to be here?

465
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:46,060
Naturally, our standard is beyond
that of the common citizen.

466
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,400
Even amongst your people, you must
have varying levels of excellence.

467
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:54,040
Occasionally we've had to accept
candidates with minor shortcomings...

468
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:57,550
but nothing that would prohibit
someone from working in a field...

469
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,070
such as law enforcement,
for example.

470
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,020
But now there are enough
of the right kind of people...

471
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,890
to warrant a new measuring stick.

472
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,990
Bodies with minds to match.

473
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:15,060
Essential as we push out further
and further.

474
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,230
Yet you still
closely monitor performance.

475
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,530
We have to ensure that people
are meeting their potential.

476
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,370
- And exceeding it.
- No one exceeds his potential.

477
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,570
If he did?

478
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,440
It would simply mean we did not
accurately gauge him in the first place.

479
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,890
- Are you all right?
- Terrific.

480
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,720
This is the entry log
for the last seven days.

481
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,530
What about you?

482
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,860
Do you have an alibi?

483
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,330
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.

484
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,500
Excuse me.

485
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,810
I'll take care of that.

486
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,100
I see I'm not the only one who
looks up every time there's a launch.

487
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

488
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,410
It's awful about the director.

489
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,530
Awful it didn't happen sooner.

490
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,810
Didn't the director threaten to
cancel your mission more than once?

491
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,780
- Yes, he did.
- Somebody did you a favor.

492
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,080
Do they have any idea whose hand
I should be shaking?

493
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,620
They found an eyelash
in the south wing.

494
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,520
- Does it have a name?
- Just some In-Valid.

495
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,890
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.

496
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,060
I'm sorry.

497
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,110
Seems you're everything
they say you are and more.

498
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,040
What about you? You're engineered
just like the rest of us.

499
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,280
Not quite.

500
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,420
"Unacceptable likelihood
of heart failure."

501
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,550
I think that's what the manual says.

502
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:00,430
The only trip I'll take in space is
around the sun on the satellite here.

503
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,360
If there's anything wrong with you,
I can't see it from here.

504
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,810
If you don't believe me--

505
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,150
Here. Take it.

506
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,650
If you're still interested,
let me know.

507
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,360
I'm sorry.
The wind caught it.

508
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:16,530
Is this the approach path
that we discussed?

509
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,210
Absolutely, Director.

510
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,210
Quite right.

511
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,770
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

512
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,060
I want what I ordered.

513
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,770
It's a completely different color.

514
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,140
Now, I'm bored of talking to you.

515
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,470
I'm bored.
I'll call you back.

516
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,200
That was the company
that sent us your hair dye.

517
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,220
They sent me "summer wheat"
instead of "honey dawn."

518
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,620
Any fool knows
it's two shades lighter.

519
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,780
She said.
"Why don't you try a change?"

520
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,790
We can't use a change.

521
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,690
Now I'm probably gonna have to pay
for the five boxes they've sent me.

522
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,200
We can't stay here.

523
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,670
Idiots I have to deal with,
you wouldn't believe.

524
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:18,130
They think I killed
the mission director.

525
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,540
- What makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.

526
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,380
Where?

527
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,310
In the corridor.

528
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,580
Well, it could be worse.
They could've found it in your eye.

529
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,180
They've got my picture
plastered up all over the place.

530
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,720
I can't turn around
without seeing my own face.

531
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,690
- They'll recognize me.
- They won't recognize you.

532
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,200
I don't recognize you!
They won't marry the eyelash to you.

533
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,730
They won't believe
that one of their elite...

534
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,100
could have suckered them
all this time.

535
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,430
No, no, no.
We change nothing.

536
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,970
We do as we planned.

537
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,570
You're Jerome Morrow,
navigator first class.

538
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,040
I'm not Jerome Morrow.

539
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,240
I'm a murder suspect.

540
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,680
What are you doing?

541
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,840
That's more than a day's work!

542
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,550
- Wait.
- We can't stay here.

543
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,560
Stop that!

544
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,750
Oh, fine!

545
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:18,990
You leave if you want,
but you're not taking that stuff.

546
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,000
That stuff is mine!

547
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:25,770
I could've rented myself out
to somebody with a spine...

548
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,860
if I'd known you were going to go
belly-up on me at the last gasp.

549
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,170
You can't quit on me now.

550
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:37,050
I've put too much into this.
What do you want me to do?

551
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,050
Wheel in there
and finish the job myself?

552
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,220
They're going to find me.

553
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,360
You still don't understand, do you?

554
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,020
When they look at you,
they don't see you anymore.

555
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,690
They only see me.

556
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,480
Keep your lashes on your lids
where they belong.

557
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,890
How could you be so careless?

558
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,490
I'm going out.

559
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,580
Where are you going?

560
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,920
If I'm gonna get arrested tomorrow,
I'm gonna go out tonight.

561
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,120
- You sure that's a good idea?
- Well, it was your idea...

562
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,360
not to change anything.

563
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,400
- Who's going?
- Just everybody.

564
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,300
Everybody.

565
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,810
If I don't go,
it'll look suspicious.

566
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:16,040
You don't want
to look suspicious, do you?

567
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,450
Thanks.

568
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,010
Who ordered this?

569
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,350
What are we doing here?

570
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,250
I'm following a lead.
Forgive me, but that's what I do.

571
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,520
I'm a detective.
I follow leads.

572
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:34,750
What makes you think
the owner of the eyelash is here?

573
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:38,850
He's an In-Valid, sir. Where do we look
for In-Valids but where In-Valids are?

574
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,690
He's an In-Valid?

575
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,900
He's an In-Valid clever enough
to go unregistered all these years.

576
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,600
Do you think he's likely
to lie down for us now?

577
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,400
- Well, what would you suggest?
- Move the inquiry...

578
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,910
back to the scene.

579
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,070
Draw a five-mile radius around Gattaca,
sweep again, random stops.

580
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:21,710
You're a navigator?
At Gattaca?

581
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,930
That's what it says, doesn't it?

582
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,610
It doesn't say you're crippled.

583
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,180
I'm not crippled.

584
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:33,150
I hurt my leg training, you moron.

585
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,150
How dare you question me?

586
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,590
Yeah, right.

587
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,780
- What's your number?
- All right, forget it.

588
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,450
What's your number,
you fucking flatfoot?

589
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,160
I said forget it.
What do you want, an apology?

590
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,790
It gets to you, doesn't it?

591
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:50,840
It gets to you that I can do
what you can only dream of!

592
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,070
I'm getting off this ball of dirt!
How dare you question me?

593
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,900
- That's harassment.
- My mistake.

594
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,910
What's your number?

595
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:05,350
May I remind you
that this is a crime scene?

596
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,480
What's this man doing here?

597
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:11,490
- What are you doing, old man?
- Doing my job, sir.

598
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:16,230
- This is evidence.
- But it's just trash.

599
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,050
You didn't know?

600
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,180
- Oh, yes.
- Wonderful, wasn't it?

601
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,820
Twelve fingers or one,
it's how you play.

602
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,990
That piece can only
be played with 12.

603
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,680
What's all this about?

604
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,450
It's probably nothing.

605
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,660
You better not. I don't want to give you
a contaminated specimen.

606
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,730
Get my meaning?

607
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,620
Thanks.

608
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,630
You never know
where those swabs have been.

609
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:09,130
I want to show you something.

610
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,240
Come on!
We'll miss it!

611
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,410
Come on.
We'll miss it.

612
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,690
What did I tell you?

613
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,710
- Strange.
- What?

614
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,720
- Your eyes look different.
- I guess it must be the light.

615
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,690
Must be.

616
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,040
Positive match.

617
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,710
I'm impressed.

618
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,480
The cup was definitely used
since the original sweep?

619
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,390
Two samples. Two days.

620
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:24,050
Either the suspect returned to the scene
of the crime to get a drink of water...

621
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,820
or he still works there.

622
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,660
I thought we checked
all the service staff.

623
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,000
I don't think he cleans up
the place anymore.

624
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:34,330
I have a feeling he might be there
under false pretenses.

625
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:37,860
A borrowed ladder?
At Gattaca?

626
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,110
It's far-fetched,
but it's not impossible.

627
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:44,340
I find it hard to believe
he could be one of their elite workers.

628
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,780
He wouldn't have the mental faculty
or the physical stamina.

629
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,790
Maybe you're underestimating him.

630
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:53,020
Maybe he is an impostor,
and maybe the director found out.

631
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:57,750
That could be his motive. Let's sample
every internal employee intravenously.

632
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,760
Two-thirds of their work force
fall under that category.

633
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:04,790
We'd close them down for days.
A fingertip or urine sample is sufficient.

634
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:09,810
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I'm not out of line.

635
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:41,670
It's only a matter of time, sir.

636
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,470
What's with the plungers, Lamar?

637
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:52,150
You open up a blood bank?

638
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:55,980
The gentlemen of law enforcement
are concerned...

639
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:59,890
that my testing methods
may have been compromised.

640
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:14,640
- Goddamn!
- I'm sorry.

641
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:17,330
- Are you out of practice?
- Here, let me look at that.

642
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:18,840
It's all right.

643
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,140
Luckily, it looks as though
we have enough.

644
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:26,780
If you need more, you can always
get it off his shoes.

645
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:49,910
So you didn't do it, after all.

646
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,210
I guess somebody beat me to it.

647
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,870
I guess.

648
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,380
I leave in two days.

649
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,820
I guess you know that.

650
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,330
But--

651
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:26,070
That's the last.

652
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,510
- Something's not right.
- He's not here.

653
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:34,070
No, we missed something.
I say we test again.

654
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,520
Test? I cannot allow you...

655
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,350
to disrupt operations any further.

656
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:41,290
You're not concerned about having
a murderer in your midst?

657
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,820
Right now your presence
is creating more of a threat.

658
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,860
The window for our latest launch
is open for seven days...

659
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,870
once every 70 years...

660
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:52,200
so it's rather crucial
we leave on time.

661
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,070
The mission means a great deal
to you, doesn't it?

662
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:59,670
And your late colleague
opposed it, didn't he?

663
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:02,710
Take another look
at my profile, Detective.

664
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,750
You won't find a violent bone
in my body.

665
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:09,310
My apologies, Director.
We won't trouble you any further.

666
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:14,020
This is not the only place
we can look.

667
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,890
Let's start making our rounds.

668
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:26,560
I'm luckier than most.
Not as lucky as some.

669
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:31,370
- I know something about that.
- You, Jerome?

670
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:34,970
What heart problem
did you ever have?

671
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,130
Did you get yours broken once?

672
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:44,080
I had this crazy idea...

673
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,420
that you were more interested
in the murder case than me.

674
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:50,620
You're right.

675
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:55,690
That's a crazy idea.

676
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:00,820
Would you like to dance?

677
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,470
It's funny.

678
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,030
You work so hard...

679
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:45,910
and you do everything you can
to get away from a place...

680
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,910
and when you finally
get your chance to leave...

681
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,370
you find a reason to stay.

682
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,220
A year is a long time.

683
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:05,890
Not so long.
Just once around the sun.

684
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,640
Hello, everyone!

685
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:20,580
I'm your detective for the evening.
Please don't leave the premises.

686
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,680
I said nobody leave!
Am I speaking...

687
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:28,010
in some strange foreign language?

688
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:30,110
Check for hairpieces, lenses, dentures.

689
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:34,350
I want napkins. I want cigarette butts.
I want the saliva off teacups.

690
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:38,760
That's a familiar face.
Check him out, will you?

691
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,290
I thought you wanted to dance.

692
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:48,360
- Excuse me. Where are you going?
- Yeah. I know. Just a minute.

693
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,440
- Are you insane?
- Come on!

694
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,900
Where did they go?

695
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,680
Come here. Come on.

696
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:46,930
- Don't you understand? I can't do that.
- You just did.

697
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:51,230
Don't touch your face!
Don't swallow! Don't spit!

698
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,240
Let's clean his teeth.

699
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,320
Who's Vincent?

700
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,970
Don't say anything.

701
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,380
What happened?

702
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,850
The scars on your legs?

703
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,720
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?

704
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,460
This is the exact height
of the front fender.

705
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:45,160
I looked left instead of right.

706
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,760
Did you just make that up,
or do you use it all the time?

707
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,070
I use it all the time.

708
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:59,070
I know you had something to do
with the director's death.

709
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,010
That's not true, Irene.

710
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:12,630
Isn't that the man from last night?

711
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,290
He's nobody.

712
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:29,610
He's one of our best.

713
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,770
I'm certain he has nothing
to do with this business.

714
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:50,060
You don't look well, Jerome.

715
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:52,330
Why don't you go home?

716
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,950
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Jerome Morrow.

717
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,650
I'm sorry. He's ill with nausea.
It's quite common before a mission.

718
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,650
Really?

719
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,660
I ought to pay him a visit.
I understand you can show me the way.

720
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:02,310
You don't know who he is, do you?

721
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:23,060
Hello?

722
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,750
Eugene, I need you
to be yourself for the day.

723
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:28,320
I was never very good at it,
remember?

724
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,300
The investigators are coming by.
I'm supposed to be sick.

725
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:34,630
So you keep telling me.
How long have I got?

726
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,140
Not long.

727
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:25,910
I guess he's not home.

728
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:31,750
- Hello?
- I'm here to see Jerome Morrow.

729
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,790
Yes, that's me.
Come up.

730
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:37,590
I guess he's home.

731
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,460
Come in!

732
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:21,940
Hello, sweetheart.

733
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,440
Where's my kiss?

734
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,750
Good to see you're feeling better.

735
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,310
Of course. Now that you're here.

736
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,830
Who's your friend?

737
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:51,400
How can I help?

738
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:53,700
It's about the director.

739
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:55,640
Oh. Again?

740
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:58,700
- I hope it's no trouble.
- No. No trouble.

741
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,440
Forgive me for not giving you
a guided tour.

742
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,810
- Couldn't we do this another time?
- This won't take a moment.

743
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,780
Maybe he can tell me what I've got.

744
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,520
Who were you expecting?

745
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,430
- Yes?
- We have our man, sir.

746
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,030
- You have him?
- We have him in custody.

747
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:36,040
I'll come right away.

748
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,990
How are you, Jerome?

749
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:04,000
Not bad, Jerome.

750
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:10,500
- How the hell did you get up here?
- Oh, I could always walk.

751
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:12,730
I've been faking it.

752
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:34,120
- Don't touch me!
- Listen to me.

753
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,130
I don't even know who you are.

754
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,860
I'm the same person I was yesterday.

755
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:41,870
I can't hear any more
of your lies, Jerome.

756
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,200
My name is Vincent!
I am Vincent Anton Freeman.

757
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,800
I'm a faith birth, de-gene-erate,
whatever you want to call it.

758
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,810
But I am not a murderer.

759
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,470
You're a God child?

760
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:59,110
But we do have one thing in common.

761
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:03,720
Only I don't have 20 or 30 years left.
Mine is already 10,000 beats overdue.

762
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:07,950
- It's not possible.
- You are the authority...

763
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:11,490
on what is not possible,
aren't you, Irene?

764
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,260
They have got you looking
so hard for any flaw...

765
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,740
that after a while
that's all that you see.

766
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,980
For whatever it's worth...

767
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:28,070
I'm here to tell you
that it is possible.

768
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,150
It is possible.

769
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:13,160
Congratulations, sir.
We did it.

770
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:17,030
His spit was found
in the dead director's eye.

771
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:21,130
While I was busy obsessing
about an eyelash, your instincts...

772
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,730
took us in the right direction.

773
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:27,140
So the In-Valid had nothing
to do with this?

774
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:30,270
Our friend here acted alone.
This mission meant everything to him.

775
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,410
Didn't it?

776
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:39,820
If they miss this launch window,
he won't live to see the next one.

777
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:44,420
And since nothing can stop the launch
now, he's being very cooperative.

778
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,060
So I imagine...

779
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:52,970
you'll be celebrating tonight, sir.

780
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,470
Of course.

781
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:12,520
I think she likes us.

782
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,590
Yeah, sure. Just give her a little time.
She'll get used to the idea.

783
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:21,600
- What was he like?
- Who? The cop?

784
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,100
- He was just a cop.
- Did you catch his name?

785
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:25,760
My name was the topic.

786
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,860
Yeah, well, he'll be back.

787
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,870
They have their man.
It's over.

788
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:33,500
No, it's not over.
I have to meet him.

789
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,820
My God, you have changed.

790
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:20,520
Don't you recognize
your own brother?

791
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,860
Are we brothers?

792
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:26,450
Our parents both died
thinking they'd outlived you.

793
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,000
I had my doubts.

794
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:31,330
What are you doing here, Anton?

795
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,730
I should ask you that question.

796
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,930
I have a right to be here.
You don't.

797
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:42,310
You almost sound
as if you believe that.

798
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:47,210
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.

799
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,680
You committed fraud.

800
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,520
You're in trouble.
I can get you out of here.

801
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57,250
Do you have any idea
what it took to get in here?

802
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:00,020
You've gone as far as you can go.
Come with me now!

803
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:03,460
There is still a few million
miles left to go.

804
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:05,020
It's over!

805
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:08,200
Is that the only way you can succeed
is to see me fail?

806
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:12,500
God! Even you are gonna tell me
what I can and can't do now!

807
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:18,070
In case you haven't noticed,
I don't need any rescuing.

808
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,710
But you did once.

809
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:27,050
Well, you've got all the answers.
How do you explain that?

810
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,460
You didn't beat me that day.
I beat myself.

811
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,490
Who are you trying to convince?

812
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:35,560
Do you want me
to prove it to you?

813
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:40,330
It's not important, Anton.
It's forgotten.

814
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,730
Do you want me to prove it to you?
I'll prove it to you!

815
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:47,470
I do.

816
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,180
Where's the shore?

817
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,410
- You wanna quit?
- We're too far out!

818
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:35,380
How are you doing this?

819
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:38,250
How have you done any of this?

820
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,260
- We have to go back.
- It's too late for that.

821
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,490
We're closer to the other side.

822
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,990
What other side?
You wanna drown us both?

823
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:50,160
You wanna know how I did it?

824
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:54,860
This is how I did it, Anton. I never
saved anything for the swim back.

825
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:42,540
You couldn't see, could you?

826
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:45,440
That night, crossing the street.

827
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:49,080
You crossed anyway.

828
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,500
If you're still interested...

829
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:08,770
let me know.

830
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:16,840
Sorry.

831
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:24,020
The wind caught it.

832
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:20,200
You're flying today, aren't you?

833
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:23,210
Look at what a mess you're in.

834
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:28,950
Come on.
I have your samples ready.

835
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:32,180
I don't need any samples
where I'm going.

836
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:38,890
You might when you get back.

837
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:45,060
Everything you need
to last you two lifetimes.

838
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:49,670
Why have you done all this?

839
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:54,100
So Jerome will always be here
when you need him.

840
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:58,200
- Where are you going?
- I'm traveling too.

841
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:04,550
I don't know how to thank you.

842
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,490
I got the better end of the deal.

843
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,790
I only lent you my body.

844
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,320
You lent me your dream.

845
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:28,740
Not until you're upstairs.

846
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:03,010
What is this?

847
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:04,670
New policy.

848
01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:13,550
Flight got you nervous?

849
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:17,890
Well, there's a problem, Lamar.

850
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:21,860
I never told you about my son, did I?
He's a big fan of yours.

851
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:28,330
Just remember...

852
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:32,070
that I was as good as any
and better than most.

853
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:34,230
He wants to apply here.

854
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:38,370
I could've gone up and back,
and nobody would've been the wiser.

855
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:42,650
Unfortunately, my son's
not all that they promised.

856
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,920
But then, who knows
what he could do?

857
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,190
Right?

858
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:09,570
For future reference...

859
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:12,910
right-handed men
don't hold it with their left.

860
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:15,350
Just one of those things.

861
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:30,760
You're gonna miss your flight, Vincent.

862
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:19,730
For someone who was never
meant for this world...

863
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,640
I must confess I'm suddenly
having a hard time leaving it.

864
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:30,600
Of course, they say every atom
in our bodies was once part of a star.

865
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:34,510
Maybe I'm not leaving.

866
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:36,520
Maybe I'm going home.
