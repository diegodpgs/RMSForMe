Now, in a dream,

We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

"l will split up my father's empire."

663
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:12,802
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

664
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,763
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

-Can we run with that?

We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

a positive emotional reaction to all this.

-You had no right.

This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

I trusted him.

01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,389
When? When he promised you
half his share?

926
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:47,809
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

927
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:50,061
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

928

That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

931
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,449
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

932
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,076
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.
