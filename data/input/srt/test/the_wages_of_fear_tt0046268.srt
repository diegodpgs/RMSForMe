1
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,340
ΤHE WAGES OF FEAR

2
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,940
Shaved ice!

3
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:34,821
Lemon, vanilla, coffee, horchata!

4
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,044
Alms for the poor, sir.

5
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,396
You should use some bleach
on that dark skin of yours.

6
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,274
I'll bleach that tongue of yours!

7
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,318
Come on, Perla.
Show me what you've got.

8
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,530
You're asking too much, wise guy.

9
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,282
Fine. Κeep it then.

10
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,535
What a disgrace!

11
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,577
I hate mutts!

12
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,329
Who asked you?

13
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,880
Listen, doc,
no one asked your opinion.

14
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,131
Some guys have all the luck.

15
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,301
I wouldn't mind a job like that.

16
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,596
It's for voters only.
Got your card?

17
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,817
Godforsaken land. Never thought
I'd be begging for work.

18
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,986
Τhere's never work for tramps.

19
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,491
Well, what'll you have?

20
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,334
Make up your minds.
What do you feel like?

21
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,669
A soda.

22
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,005
One soda for the bunch of you?

23
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,756
Get it and leave us alone!

24
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,968
You think I'm here
to wait on you hand and foot!

25
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,263
Rosa, a soda for the doctor.

26
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,182
Right away, sir.

27
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,924
You're asking for it!

28
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,595
Τhere's so little
to entertain us here.

29
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,514
If it wasn't for this heat -

30
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,189
What are we hanging
around here for?

31
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,818
- You coming tonight?
- Maybe.

32
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,071
You got them?
- In the flour sack.

33
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,743
Give me a kiss.

34
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,081
Hey, watch the clothes!

35
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,832
Linda, come here!

36
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,461
At the flour again, eh?

37
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,171
Don't I feed you?

38
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,924
I didn't eat your flour.

39
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,009
Caught in the act!

40
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,636
I'll show you!

41
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:09,804
Forget it.

42
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,555
Mind your own business.

43
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,599
He's itching for trouble.

44
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,351
You got some objection?

45
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,729
You're just a pack of tramps.

46
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,733
All you do is loaf around

47
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,904
and scare away the customers.

48
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,156
Scram or I'll call the cops.

49
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,075
You squealer.

50
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,536
Τhey may be interested
in your papers.

51
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,787
You'd turn us in?

52
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,790
I'm a citizen here,
not a lousy foreigner.

53
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,543
A real credit to the white race!

54
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,592
What are you waiting for?

55
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,219
Did you hear me?

56
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,804
Beat it!

57
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,473
If I ever hear

58
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,600
that you even touched
a hair on her head -

59
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,937
Me? I wouldn't hurt her.

60
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,482
On the contrary.

61
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,735
I only want to do her good.
Don't I, baby?

62
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,073
Go to my room.
I'll be right up.

63
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,075
Yes, sir.

64
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,162
Leave that.

65
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,502
You and your tricks!

66
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,088
Clear out of here,
you lousy bum!

67
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,215
Cheap tramp!

68
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,008
Cheap tramp!

69
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,885
Τake it easy!

70
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,220
- Get lost!
- You don't own the street.

71
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,139
Stay out here, then.

72
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,893
In the morning you can take a stroll
down to immigration.

73
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,895
Dirty rat! Louse!

74
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,730
Your insults go in one ear -

75
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,569
You going up or not?

76
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,911
Where's that lazy hooligan?

77
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,121
Right here.

78
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,041
The mail!
Didn't you hear the plane?

79
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,460
You should already be
at the airport!

80
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,712
Hurry up!

81
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,924
You'll drive me out of business!

82
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,886
- What's this?
- Can I go with you?

83
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,638
Move over, quick.

84
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,092
One day I'll find the right pilot.

85
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,762
He'll let me ride with the baggage.

86
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,223
I'll show him my US visa.

87
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,101
It's authentic.
Did I ever show it to you?

88
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,437
To me and everyone else -
a bad mistake.

89
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,233
Some guys might get ideas.
Put it away.

90
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,452
Attention, please.

91
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,788
Everyone clear the field.

92
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,752
The International Airlines
flight from the capital

93
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,630
is now landing
on runway number one.

94
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:37,303
All passengers
please proceed to customs.

95
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,807
Hi, Pepito. What's new?

96
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,770
Listen, boss,
I've got a passport.

97
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,428
Your papers.

98
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,057
Next.

99
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,194
Next.

100
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,532
Step around.

101
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,870
Any baggage?

102
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,622
No.

103
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,209
- And no passport either, eh?
- Yes, I have one.

104
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,465
What brings you here?

105
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,967
I don't know yet.

106
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,774
We'll put down "tourist."

107
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,458
- What's the problem?
- A traffic jam.

108
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,420
Tito! Come on!

109
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,256
Come on, now!

110
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,550
The lady and the child.

111
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,094
That's right.

112
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,847
Smile.
Don't move, please.

113
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,196
Hey, that'll be a dollar.

114
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,658
Wait. I may not stop here.

115
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,832
Alms for the poor?

116
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,160
You want an autograph or what?

117
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,101
You French?

118
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:18,732
A pleasure running into someone
like you, kid, 'cause frankly -

119
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,321
- Where you from?
- Paris, rue des Pyrénées.

120
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,031
I'm from Propriano.

121
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,616
Ah, a Corsican.

122
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,493
But I used to work in Paris.

123
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,411
They pay us too, you know.

124
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,707
Swell! This won't be
as bad as I thought.

125
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,001
You just come from Tegucigalpa?

126
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,419
Could be.

127
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,382
Give me the lowdown.

128
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,176
I'm dead broke.

129
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,303
Anything doing here?

130
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:52,140
Let's try the saloon.
Hernández isn't a bad guy.

131
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,725
Is it far?

132
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,400
Let's take the taxi.
It'll look better.

133
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,652
The Corsair.

134
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,089
Hey, boss.
I brought a pal along.

135
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,967
Haven't you screwed me over
enough?

136
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,260
Wait a minute!

137
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,722
A sight for sore eyes.

138
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:36,184
Hi, buddy.
Pay the taxi.

139
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,107
- Who is this guy?
- I thought he was your pal.

140
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,819
- You know him?
- By reputation.

141
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,286
Come along, kid.

142
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,414
Set one up for my pal too.

143
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,541
Sit down.

144
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,795
- Much obliged, sir.
- Don't start with the formalities now.

145
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,590
You can call me Jo.

146
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,301
But to the others,

147
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,887
I'm Mr. Jo.

148
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,097
Get it?

149
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,977
Here's to you, Jo.

150
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,062
Cheers.

151
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,903
It'll all work out.
Don't worry.

152
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,572
Not a bad joint.

153
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,741
You get tired of it.

154
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,078
It's none of my business,
but how'd you ever pick this dump?

155
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,747
You don't always get a choice.

156
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,334
I had to beat it fast.
Couldn't even get to the bank.

157
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,753
I hightailed it to the airport,

158
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,173
emptied my pockets
and said, "Give me a $50 ticket."

159
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,342
And here I am.

160
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,893
This is Linda.
A sweet kid.

161
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,313
So I see.

162
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,943
Say something.
Be polite.

163
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,446
She's nice,
but she's got no manners.

164
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,031
She's half savage.

165
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,283
I popped a button.
Go on, now.

166
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,206
Get a load of the locals.

167
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,460
That one fell right out of
a coconut tree.

168
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,298
You had any chow?

169
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,592
On the plane.

170
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,928
The meal was included.

171
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,222
Then pardon me
while I get some grub.

172
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,932
Can't you get it here?

173
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,353
No, I've got a place in town.
A man's gotta be independent.

174
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,188
Of course.

175
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,607
I won't be long.

176
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,615
You see?
Didn't even have to look for it.

177
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,659
Of course.

178
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,506
Hey, pal!

179
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,592
You been mixing cement today?

180
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,761
I finished the framework.

181
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,555
We got a new mixer.

182
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,558
They might even give us a machine.

183
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,227
You don't know
what I've been through.

184
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,024
Say, you rob a bank?
Or is it your birthday?

185
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,692
It was a present.

186
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:35,030
Pasta again?
- Stop your grumbling.

187
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,783
I'll make you a swell sauce.

188
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,619
No time.
I'll eat it plain.

189
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,371
I've got a date.
- With a woman?

190
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,706
What woman?

191
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,334
A man - a real one!

192
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:52,964
There.

193
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,634
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

194
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,475
I'm thirsty.

195
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,436
Got any money?

196
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,188
Take it out of my back wages.

197
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,398
Let's see.

198
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,151
Poor guy.

199
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,823
Two beers outside.

200
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,885
You must have gulped it down.

201
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,179
When I'm happy,
I have no appetite. Here.

202
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,764
Thanks, kid.

203
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,725
Just enjoying some good cognac.

204
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,855
- They served you the best.
- I helped myself.

205
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,700
- Allow me, milord.
- Cool it, kid.

206
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,127
- Turn that off. I don't like music.
- Sorry.

207
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,952
Hey!

208
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:51,124
Turn that thing off.
It's driving me crazy.

209
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:08,141
- You won't see us anymore.
- Out! Out!

210
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,936
We won't set foot
in your place again.

211
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,606
We're going someplace else.

212
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,108
Go get some fresh air.

213
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,364
A bunch of bellyachers!

214
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,116
A bunch of bellyachers.

215
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,952
Naturally.

216
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,954
Not one of us here has any work.

217
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,748
Just occasional odd jobs.

218
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,960
Just enough to eat
and buy a drink.

219
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,878
Why don't you clear out?

220
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,006
I would if I could.

221
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,883
This is no cage.
Plenty of space here.

222
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,845
That's the trouble. It takes
too much effort to cross it.

223
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,348
- Hit the rails.
- No trains here.

224
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,810
- The highway?
- It ends at the oil wells.

225
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,020
- A plane?
- Too expensive.

226
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,148
Caracas is too close

227
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,942
and too hot.

228
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,445
Besides, it costs $300.

229
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,698
You got that much?

230
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,158
Me neither.

231
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,577
And you need a visa.

232
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,081
- That can be arranged.
- A real one?

233
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,666
That too.

234
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,586
That takes dough,
for dough you need a job,

235
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,630
and there are no jobs here.

236
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,132
Look.

237
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,843
They started that building
two years ago

238
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,594
but then just gave up.

239
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,305
Can't blame 'em with this sun.

240
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,851
It's like prison here.

241
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,979
Easy to get in.
"Make yourself at home."

242
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,482
But there's no way out, and if
you don't get out, you croak.

243
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,361
- Well, I don't feel like croaking.
- Nobody does.

244
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,447
But they do anyway.

245
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,575
Here's the proof.
- He couldn't stand up anymore.

246
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,827
Not with that fever.

247
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,204
And it's not just
mosquitoes here.

248
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,542
It's spiders too,
and critters that eat your liver.

249
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,878
Even leprosy.

250
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,131
Everyone checks their wrists
for spots in the morning.

251
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,176
And that's just the small stuff.

252
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,928
No, there's only
one real chronic sickness:

253
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,055
hunger.

254
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,683
That's what kills most of us.
But not them.

255
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,894
That spot's for the yanks.

256
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,688
- Americans here?
- You kidding?

257
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,066
If there's oil around,
they're not far behind.

258
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,359
SOC is their company.

259
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,320
They've got a camp.

260
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,155
They're organized:

261
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,325
houses, cafeteria, cemetery,

262
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,243
all prefabricated.

263
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,914
O'Brien comes by once a week
to check on things.

264
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,750
Bill O'Brien?

265
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,335
A big guy?
- Κnow him?

266
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:44,089
You kidding? We ran
contraband together back in '32.

267
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,715
Sorry.

268
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,592
That changes everything.

269
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,486
When I need dough,
I get mean.

270
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,706
You've got 900 miles of pipeline.

271
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,793
That's fragile stuff.

272
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,962
A little dynamite...

273
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,423
makes a lot of noise.

274
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,261
Just let the cops
try and pin it on me.

275
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,392
- No go, eh?
- For now. But that'll change.

276
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,395
There's gotta be dough
to nab around here somewhere.

277
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,399
Better shoot for oil.
When that stops, everything stops.

278
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,860
Look at that guy.

279
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,821
They fired him.

280
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,907
Look at him now.

281
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,540
- Excuse me.
- Who's he?

282
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,251
My pal Luigi.
A good guy.

283
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,631
Haven't seen
much of you lately.

284
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,259
If you only knew
how busy we are.

285
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,511
Let's swap jobs.

286
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,348
We work...

287
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,059
with our brains.

288
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:05,355
- How's the job?
- So-so. Could pay better.

289
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,983
This guy's greedy as hell.
Never has enough.

290
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,069
Earns two bucks,
squirrels one away.

291
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,488
Have to.
I'm saving to go home.

292
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:18,243
Sorry, this rat doesn't seem
to like us talking.

293
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,289
See what I mean?
Got his nose to the grindstone.

294
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,874
We share a room.

295
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:29,921
He does all the ironing and cooking.
A terrific guy!

296
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,923
A real chump.

297
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,641
Why's your pal sore at me?

298
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,893
It's only natural.

299
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,646
He used to see a lot of me.

300
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,691
Now I'm always with you,
and he's left high and dry.

301
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,651
What a jerk.

302
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,780
Now what?

303
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:56,990
Look!

304
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,200
Don't be afraid.

305
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,703
Ugly critters here!

306
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,663
Let's go get a haircut.

307
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,791
- I just got one Saturday.
- Keep me company.

308
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,167
It's just that -

309
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,337
I've got a date with Linda.
It's her day off.

310
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,798
Ah, sorry.
That changes everything.

311
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,383
Very well.

312
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,509
Sore at me?

313
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,805
Who do you think you are?
Get a load of yourself.

314
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,640
Wait, Jo!

315
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,312
- Where are you going?
- I've got some business with Jo.

316
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,607
Look at the pretty new dress
I made.

317
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,318
It's this one.

318
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,988
Exactly the same, isn't it?

319
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,658
Very pretty.
But you'll ruin it by wearing it.

320
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,119
- I'll make another.
- Coming or not?

321
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,498
Won't you lend him to me,
Mr. Jo?

322
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,335
One day a month
isn't much to ask.

323
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,339
He's old enough
to decide for himself.

324
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,383
- I'm coming.
- Too late!

325
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,971
- Happy now?
- Beat me if you'd like.

326
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,932
I don't know what stops me!

327
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,186
Come on. If we gotta go out,
let's get going.

328
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,190
And stop pouting!

329
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,988
I'm in a bind, sir.
My visa expires in a month,

330
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,948
and I don't have the fare.

331
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,203
A hundred dollars
would save my life.

332
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,996
Please help me out.

333
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,210
I'll pay you back.
I'm from a good family.

334
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,046
You're a decent man too.

335
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,799
Beat it, kid.
You're bugging me.

336
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,013
That'll teach you!

337
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,556
You give her a piece of your mind?

338
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,683
I can't take the nagging.

339
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,936
Women are a waste of time
for guys like us.

340
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,739
No luck.
This goes to the cleaners.

341
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,866
What'll I wear in the meantime?

342
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,787
I can't go around bare-assed -
not at my age.

343
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,290
Don't worry.
We're well stocked here.

344
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,417
Here.

345
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,086
Wear a pair of Luigi's.

346
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,963
Is this gangster here
Luigi's old man?

347
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,965
Not bad, eh?

348
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,134
Will these do?
- Let me see.

349
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,510
Say,

350
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,720
you see my museum?

351
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,597
These are my pinups.

352
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,101
Gives you something to think about
while pawing the savages here.

353
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,938
And that's the treasure.

354
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,107
The crown jewel.

355
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,111
Get a load of this.

356
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,865
No kidding.
I haven't seen one in years.

357
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,410
Pigalle.

358
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,912
Last ride I took.

359
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,248
It took me to the train,
the train to the boat,

360
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,875
and the boat got me here.

361
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,586
A longer trip
than I bargained for.

362
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,172
It used to cost a franc.

363
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,091
But it costs $1,000 to get back!

364
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,343
And the price keeps going up.

365
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,974
I'll handle this.

366
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,981
Hello, old buddy.

367
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,198
Very nice.
Make yourself right at home.

368
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,493
Those are my pants.
I worked hard for 'em.

369
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,122
- What's he saying?
- Stop beefing. You'll get them back,

370
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,124
all cleaned and disinfected.

371
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,834
Ah, keep 'em.

372
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,504
Give them to anyone you like.

373
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,589
Cut it out, now.
We're not married.

374
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,842
If you don't like it,
I'm clearing out.

375
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,552
- What does he want?
- Nothing. He's nuts.

376
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,304
Let's go before I get sore.

377
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,348
That's it - get out!

378
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,225
I won't miss you.

379
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,853
See how I handled him?

380
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,105
Wait.

381
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,611
Couldn't leave this.

382
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,563
- Guess what.
- What?

383
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,690
- Luigi's on his way.
- Really?

384
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,067
I'll go tell the others.

385
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:17,226
- There's gonna be trouble.
- A real brawl.

386
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,824
Good evening, Pepito.

387
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,785
Getting married?

388
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,704
I'm treating the gang.

389
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,873
Drinks are on me, boys.

390
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,796
- What will it be?
- Hey, you!

391
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,507
Two whiskeys.
- Right away, Mr. Jo.

392
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,093
I ordered first.

393
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,137
Sure. Sodas for five?

394
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,973
Sodas?
We're not broke!

395
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,391
Champagne!

396
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,479
Sparkling champagne!

397
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,485
- Real champagne, Luigi?
- Of course.

398
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,655
You're rich!
Can I have a taste?

399
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,823
My pleasure.

400
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,118
That's right.
Some music will cheer things up.

401
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,499
Your buddy's getting
on my nerves.

402
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,003
May I have the honor?

403
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,172
It would be my pleasure.

404
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,340
Two for supper

405
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,393
Two for supper

406
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,831
Waiter!
We're starving!

407
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,125
Coming!

408
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:51,881
Well?

409
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,429
The gentleman has been served.

410
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,369
What are you waiting for?

411
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,922
I'm warning you.

412
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,801
I can't afford to duke it out
like a dockhand.

413
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,093
I'll shoot.

414
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,596
Easy to show off with that.

415
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,019
Here.

416
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,527
Well, shoot.

417
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,866
I can't do it just like that.

418
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,285
How about like this?

419
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,228
You don't look so good.

420
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,439
A gun's not enough.
It takes guts.

421
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,191
I'm not a killer.

422
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,489
- Now, where's that whiskey?
- Right away.

423
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,367
- You scared the shit out of me.
- That was nothing.

424
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,662
Did you have to slap him?
It could have gotten ugly.

425
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,207
That was just
to spice things up.

426
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,880
They came around with their money.
"To make you rich," they said.

427
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,049
No! To ruin our lives!

428
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,052
To send our boys to their death.

429
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,307
And yesterday
a catastrophe happened.

430
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,559
It's not fair.

431
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,978
We're always the ones to suffer.

432
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,606
We're always the ones to die.

433
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,232
She's right.

434
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,069
The gringos never die!

435
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,406
They kill my father
or your brother.

436
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,825
They give you a handful of money,
and that's that.

437
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,829
- That's right! They killed my brother!
- And my husband.

438
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,707
Francisco lost a leg
in one of their machines!

439
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,584
But they paid you.

440
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,210
Practically nothing!

441
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,255
What's going on, a revolution?

442
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,508
An accident at an oil well
about 300 miles from here.

443
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,928
It's been burning all night.

444
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:48,223
Thirteen victims,
all from around here.

445
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,935
The mountain's on fire.

446
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,270
You can see the flames
from heaven itself.

447
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,064
- Who's dead?
- No one knows.

448
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,941
We have a right to know!

449
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,567
Here they come!

450
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,059
Good pay.

451
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,895
Apply at the SOC office.

452
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,942
This is the break
I've been waiting for!

453
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:56,490
Experienced drivers sought

454
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,909
for dangerous work.

455
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,661
Good pay.

456
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,958
You hear that?

457
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,377
$2,000 a piece.

458
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,588
In a week we'll be far away,
rolling in dough!

459
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:15,801
And we'll remember
what a swell guy Hernández was!

460
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:44,663
A little more.
Take a deep breath.

461
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,084
Your lungs are full of cement.

462
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,463
These spots here
are packed solid.

463
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,634
Keep this up
and you won't last long.

464
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,970
How long?

465
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:04,433
- Six months, a year - maybe more.
- Maybe less.

466
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,481
What should I do?
- Clear out immediately.

467
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,360
- How can I?
- That's the question.

468
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:17,821
Seeking experienced drivers.

469
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:22,617
Dangerous work.
Very good wages.

470
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,122
- What are you paying?
- $2,000.

471
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:47,929
You mustn't go!
You'll be killed!

472
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,765
Don't go with him!
It's dangerous!

473
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,101
You'll all be killed!

474
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,764
But I've got a visa. I drive well.
It's those bastards' fault.

475
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,016
Who's up next?

476
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,271
But I've got a visa. I drive well.
It's those bastards' fault.

477
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,107
If anyone tries any tricks,

478
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,277
I'll grab the first guy I see

479
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,447
and smash his mug
on a roll bar!

480
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,407
I'll kill myself.

481
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,035
It'll be on your conscience.
I'll kill myself!

482
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,709
And they're made of iron!

483
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,922
That makes one.

484
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,850
You drove like a pro.

485
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,602
You were way better.

486
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,455
I told you.

487
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,088
What about me?

488
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,881
Filthy tricks!

489
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,264
He had 'em picked out beforehand.

490
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,308
You could have just said so.

491
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:31,176
- Come on.
- No, you go on ahead.

492
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:36,348
Don't worry.
You and I'll manage fine.

493
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:43,772
The show's over now.
You can stop playing big boss.

494
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,108
It's just you and me now -
Bill and Jo -

495
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,194
and we're gonna talk straight.

496
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:55,116
Cut it out!
We've known each other too long.

497
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:58,078
You know I can drive.
So what gives?

498
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,499
You're too old, Jo,
and so am I.

499
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,627
We're played out.

500
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,513
Well, I don't feel old.

501
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:21,267
One of those guys'll back out.
- We'll see.

502
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,770
- Wanna bet?
- $2,000.

503
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,941
If anyone backs out,
the job's yours.

504
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,944
Now you're talking.

505
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:55,969
Dear Mama, I found a job.

506
00:50:56,137 --> 00:51:00,306
If I don't write for a while,
don't worry.

507
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,100
Love, Bernardo.

508
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:11,192
One, two, three, four,
five, six, on the house!

509
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,778
- Mud in your eye!
- To the millionaires!

510
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,449
- Linda, please.
- Not now.

511
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,242
Let him talk.

512
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,035
It's very important.

513
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,290
Please mail this
in the morning.

514
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:28,293
Stop crying.
You'll go next time.

515
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,712
Why act like this?
You're a man.

516
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,506
You guys are men, not me.

517
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,510
Where's Jo?

518
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:41,222
He came in after you
and holed up in his room.

519
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:46,936
He did his dirty work
and now he's hiding.

520
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,689
You leave
while he stays behind.

521
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,530
One more hour.

522
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,950
That's enough!
Go bawl outside!

523
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,751
An hour can be a long time.

524
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:41,032
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

525
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,827
Blessed art thou among women,

526
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:47,163
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

527
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,332
Holy Mary, mother of God,

528
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,879
pray for us sinners.

529
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,600
Quick! Everybody, come!

530
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:08,977
Hurry!

531
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,937
What's eating you?

532
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:14,858
He's dead.
He hanged himself outside.

533
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:16,943
Who, Jo?

534
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:20,029
No, the kid.

535
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,448
The Italian, Bernardo.

536
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,620
Mr. O'Brien's first victim.

537
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,176
We sure look classy.

538
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,473
Can't kick off without a uniform.

539
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,059
Even when they guillotine you,

540
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,688
they dress you up first.

541
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,090
It's not like him to be late.

542
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,134
No, not him.

543
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,056
I'll call the hotel just in case.

544
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:30,892
Wait.

545
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,894
Here he comes.

546
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,945
Hello, boys.

547
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:44,447
I came to see my pal off.

548
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,330
What's the matter?

549
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,248
Looks like a funeral.

550
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,001
Did you happen
to see Smerloff?

551
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:00,838
Why? Hasn't he shown up?

552
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,967
That's irresponsible of him.

553
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,469
Who saw him last?

554
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:11,015
He had a drink with us,
and then he left with Jo.

555
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:16,813
We had things to talk about.
Any law against that?

556
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,864
Think we're making
a big mistake?

557
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,533
- What's wrong?
- I'm scared stiff.

558
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,912
Scared I won't have what it takes.

559
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,625
Don't worry, kid.
I'll show you how it's done.

560
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,195
Where's the stuff?

561
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,802
They're off to dinner.

562
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,806
Easy on the booze.
It's bad for the reflexes.

563
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,443
- Heads or tails?
- What for?

564
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:27,128
Makes no goddamn difference.

565
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,839
Like hell it doesn't!

566
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,424
Let's flip for it.

567
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,847
Tails.
- Heads.

568
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,852
I always lose.

569
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,604
Talk about luck!

570
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,798
- Shall we?
- Hold your horses.

571
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,259
I'm not leaving just yet.

572
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,723
Wait a minute.

573
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,480
What's the pressure?

574
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,484
Yeah, right.

575
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,612
If anything goes wrong,
I'm the one who'll get it.

576
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,447
So excuse me!

577
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,074
Climb in, kid.

578
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:43,621
Every minute you lose
costs dough!

579
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,584
Light 'em up.

580
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:51,629
Running lights.

581
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,757
Headlights.

582
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,262
Searchlights.

583
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,598
All right.

584
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,272
If you want to drive this heap,
go ahead.

585
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,483
Are you the one
with the bomb on his tail?

586
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,110
Then leave me alone.

587
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,620
I brought you something, Jo.

588
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:27,623
This is for you.

589
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,208
You're crazy.

590
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,793
Take it.

591
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:36,173
- You sure?
- It's no good anymore anyway.

592
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,218
Yeah, pal.

593
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:41,178
Break a leg.

594
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,405
Hey, didn't you fill the tank?

595
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,907
The contact.

596
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,330
It's okay now.

597
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,190
Right - good luck!

598
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,484
Coca-Cola! Some deal!

599
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,388
He knows his stuff.

600
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,654
Mario, my darling,
why are you doing this?

601
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,199
I begged you not to go.

602
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:53,621
I'd have robbed or killed

603
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,331
to keep you by my side.

604
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,959
You don't care if I'm unhappy.

605
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,962
I hate you!
I despise you!

606
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,173
Watch the bumps!

607
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,800
Have pity on me, darling!

608
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,220
That's enough!
Beat it, okay?

609
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:16,227
Good-bye, my love.

610
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:20,272
Promise you'll be careful.

611
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,525
Promise you'll come back!

612
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,901
Get lost, damn it!

613
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,329
Made it this time.

614
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,748
And next time too.
Stop worrying.

615
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,585
Is it hot or cold?

616
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,420
Hot. Why?

617
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,505
I'm freezing.

618
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,424
Want your sweater?

619
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,009
Not now.

620
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,514
Thanks, kid.

621
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,193
Wipe my brow.

622
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,903
Something wrong?

623
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,655
I think I'm sick.

624
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:54,908
- You got a fever?
- I'm shivering.

625
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:57,870
A touch of malaria.

626
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,455
We're off to a good start.

627
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,294
Where are we?

628
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,297
Two hundred yards from the bend.

629
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:11,508
Only 300 miles to go.

630
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:36,158
Hey, do you smell oil?

631
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,203
No.

632
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:42,998
Maybe the engine's hot.
We've been in second for an hour.

633
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,877
Okay, let's let it
cool down a bit.

634
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:59,556
- It's warm but not overheated.
- Better safe than sorry.

635
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:04,436
I feel better now.
How about a bite?

636
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,146
Already?

637
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,649
We've only gone ten miles

638
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,485
and we're already falling behind.

639
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:18,409
They're expecting us, you know.
- We didn't punch any clock.

640
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,327
I don't give a damn
about their oil.

641
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:23,205
Think we'll get
year-end dividends?

642
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,338
Come on, let's go!

643
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:32,881
Are you nuts?

644
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,007
Look!

645
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,848
- Oh, God.
- Rest later. Let's move!

646
01:07:57,407 --> 01:08:01,368
Hear that?
Must be nice to have dough.

647
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,537
It's funny.

648
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:05,831
Yesterday we were
like other people,

649
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,208
just like everyone else.

650
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:11,462
We had fun, we slept, we ate.

651
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,423
We knew men and women.

652
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:17,593
And now

653
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:20,137
there's nobody.

654
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,431
Just us two.

655
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,016
Two's enough.

656
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,769
Enough to drive a truck.

657
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,522
But I like to be with people.

658
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,778
Sitting outside in the evening,
drinking wine

659
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,654
and talking.
- About what?

660
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:41,158
I don't know.
Whatever comes into my head.

661
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:46,789
Then you take a girl into the corner,
give her a tickle.

662
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,167
Don't you like women?

663
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,297
You've had too easy a life.
- You think so?

664
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,176
You were daddy's little boy.
What does your father do?

665
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:00,969
I'm an orphan.

666
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,222
How old are you?

667
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:05,766
A hundred.

668
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:08,393
A hundred? Come on!

669
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:12,272
Just takes a few months
to get to be a hundred...

670
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:18,111
if you're in the right place
at the right time.

671
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,949
Not even time for coffee.

672
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:30,707
- Feeling sick again?
- I don't like to be rushed.

673
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:36,004
How am I supposed to hold that?
- With your hands.

674
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,925
What if we get a flat?

675
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,761
With new tires?
Come off it.

676
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:44,388
It's happened.

677
01:09:44,973 --> 01:09:46,682
Want me to throw it out?

678
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,684
Hold it up for me.

679
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,522
That's right.
Drink it down, pops.

680
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:57,526
What's the matter now?

681
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:03,323
Take the wheel.

682
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,170
I told you not to stuff your face!

683
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,154
What happened?
Did you break down?

684
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,239
He's sick.

685
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,409
Sick? Him?

686
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,453
He's drunk, or scared stiff.

687
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:51,955
Jo, scared?
Go say that to his face.

688
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:56,376
Damned right I will.
We're talking to you, big shot!

689
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:58,921
- Up yours.
- Leave him alone.

690
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,633
Relax, I won't steal him from you.

691
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,385
Now get moving!
I'm not spending the night here!

692
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,846
We'll move
when we're good and ready.

693
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:10,849
We're not taking orders from you.

694
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,185
And we're not stopping
every 10 miles.

695
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,189
Forget it, kid.
Let 'em go ahead if they want to.

696
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,525
Your orders were to stay
a half hour ahead of us.

697
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,570
Forget it.
You saw how they drive.

698
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,366
With them in the lead,
we'll crawl along like snails.

699
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,327
Some drivers!

700
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,997
A couple of lugs!

701
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,820
We'll see how they like it
when things get tough.

702
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,197
Why?
Does it get bad further on?

703
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:11,159
It's okay until the corral.

704
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:14,913
After that, the road gets ugly.

705
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:18,291
You know what corrugated iron is?

706
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,419
Yeah, you use it to cover a shack.

707
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:24,172
That's what they call bad road here -
"the washboard."

708
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,926
The wind blows ruts
into the road,

709
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,679
and they shake the hell
out of the chassis.

710
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:34,683
- The nitro could blow.
- Not if you go fast.

711
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:38,812
At 40 miles an hour,
you fly over the bumps.

712
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,189
But you have to keep
your speed up.

713
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,859
Under 30, you start vibrating,

714
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,861
and you're done for.

715
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,989
How long is it like that?

716
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:51,867
For about 20 miles
past the corral.

717
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:54,911
Here's the corral.

718
01:12:55,997 --> 01:12:57,414
After that, the washboard.

719
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:58,999
Pump six is in the middle.

720
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,584
The Americans laid down
some concrete.

721
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:04,337
Even there, you can't slow down.
No time to speed up again.

722
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,673
You gotta stay at full speed.

723
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,259
Or we can take it slow.

724
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:12,012
You'll vibrate, man.
It's bad washboard.

725
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,057
To be safe, we'd have to stay

726
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,391
under six miles an hour.

727
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:17,726
Okay.

728
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,895
Let's take it slow.

729
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:21,646
Are you nuts?

730
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,649
Twenty miles
will take us four hours.

731
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:29,404
After the bridge,
speed up to 40 miles an hour.

732
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:39,247
30...

733
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,917
35...

734
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,586
40.

735
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:49,966
Here's the corral.

736
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,397
That's it.
Make those tires sing

737
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,982
and don't stop!

738
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,242
You hear that?

739
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,127
It's okay now.

740
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,379
Are you sure?
Could be water in the gas tank.

741
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:30,298
- Don't even say that.
- We're on the bad road.

742
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,885
If it's the engine, we're fucked.

743
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,514
Time to go.

744
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,184
Let me finish my smoke.

745
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:44,729
- Finish it on the way.
- I can't drive and smoke.

746
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,399
I can't enjoy it.

747
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:52,279
- You okay?
- Yeah.

748
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:56,741
Get ready to head down.
- Give it some gas.

749
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,911
Really floor it.
Build up some speed.

750
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,764
- Can you see?
- Yes.

751
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:23,518
Start slowing down a little.

752
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:27,105
It won't be easy.

753
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,624
We won't make it,
I'm telling you.

754
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,378
The sign's right there.
We're close.

755
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,301
Start accelerating, Jo.

756
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,428
- Shouldn't we -
- No.

757
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:00,222
Twelve minutes at high speed!

758
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,057
- It can't blow up.
- Knock on wood.

759
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:03,975
My hands are full of it.

760
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:20,784
Move it. Fourth gear.

761
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,580
Floor it. Speed up!

762
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:33,964
Push it, man!
Just 100 yards to go!

763
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,139
Come on, man!

764
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:46,351
Step on the gas,
for God's sake!

765
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,527
Are you crazy?
You blew it!

766
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:57,612
Why didn't you go?
What happened?

767
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,699
It's not my fault.
It's this lousy truck!

768
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:04,494
That can't be.
A brand-new truck should go fast.

769
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:06,496
It might have a throttle governor.

770
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,833
The Americans are worried
we'll mess up their stuff.

771
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:14,462
If that's true,
they're gonna hear from me!

772
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,506
I'm sure that's it.

773
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:20,635
Nothing else it could be.

774
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,485
We're gonna try again.

775
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,113
- Nothing in the engine?
- Nothing.

776
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,907
Back up so I can see.

777
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,452
Move it!

778
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,842
Come here and look.

779
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:05,305
Look.

780
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,683
If we turn around,
we'll dig in deeper.

781
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:11,811
- So?
- We have to back up in our tracks.

782
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:15,148
Are you nuts?
You'll end up in the ruts.

783
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:18,401
If you spin out,
we're in a real mess.

784
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:22,030
We won't spin out.
Now come guide me.

785
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,408
If I had the bastard
who filled up the tank!

786
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,537
I bet he started
to put in diesel,

787
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,875
and when he realized it,
the jerk didn't say a word.

788
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:38,880
Don't worry.
I'll find the guy.

789
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:41,925
Stop your moaning.
Now you'll get clean gas.

790
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:46,304
I'm thinking. We don't
have room to speed up.

791
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,224
Too bad.
We'll take the last part slow.

792
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:52,102
What about the others?
If they're moving too fast,

793
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,354
they won't be able to stop.

794
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:56,272
They'll smash into us.

795
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,734
Trust me.
They're crawling along.

796
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:04,572
Otherwise they'd be here already.

797
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:08,451
I still want to leave them a sign.

798
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,662
Go ahead while I finish up here.

799
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,414
You got a handkerchief?

800
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,793
What a shame.
It's brand-new.

801
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:17,919
Wait.

802
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,090
At least I used it once.

803
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,116
- Make up your mind!
- You're out of the tracks.

804
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,537
That's far enough. Get in.

805
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:55,623
- Maybe 100 more yards.
- Let's go.

806
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,646
Another mile or two
and we'll be okay.

807
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:02,357
We're doing just fine, my boy.

808
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,858
You brought it.

809
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:41,372
- Are you nuts? What's wrong?
- Don't you see 'em?

810
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,499
- Who?
- Them. The Dodge.

811
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:46,252
I can't see.
It's too far.

812
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,337
Look!

813
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,506
You're right. It's them.

814
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,810
They're getting close.
Speed up!

815
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,736
How far away are they?

816
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:16,658
- About half a mile.
- Half a mile? We're really moving.

817
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,451
It's all over.

818
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:24,916
No, it's not over.
Look.

819
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:28,586
The silver marker
is the end of the washboard.

820
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,254
Ten seconds.

821
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,925
1 ... 2...

822
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,343
Shut up!

823
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,845
3... 4...

824
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,347
5...

825
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:40,848
6...

826
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,433
7...

827
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:46,854
10...

828
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:48,690
Leave it!

829
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:52,527
12, 13, 14!

830
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,077
Look, idiot!

831
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:02,870
They're speeding up!

832
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,041
That's it, Jo.

833
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:08,835
We made it.

834
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,960
Looks bad.

835
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:53,004
Doesn't look pretty.

836
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,926
They're widening the road.

837
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,429
We can't get by.

838
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,473
We gotta maneuver around it.

839
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,435
We'll have to come around here
as far as possible...

840
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,482
then back up here...

841
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:15,234
and then take off.

842
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,740
Okay. Come on.

843
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,134
Slowly.

844
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,725
Back up.

845
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:31,352
You got lots of room.

846
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,851
It's nothing.
Just some rotten wood.

847
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,030
Will it hold?

848
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,365
Give it a try!

849
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,981
Thanks, Luigi.

850
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:44,235
It was nothing. Just takes
a good eye and a little muscle.

851
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,406
Come see.

852
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:54,745
Man, that's what you call a -

853
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:59,500
A real rat trap!

854
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:02,795
We gotta warn the others.

855
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:05,840
How are they gonna get through?

856
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,217
They'll manage.

857
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:10,302
Anyway, they should've
stayed in the lead.

858
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:14,890
Hear that?

859
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:17,309
It's them!

860
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:45,504
Are those for guys
who got flattened up here?

861
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,008
They used to cart
three-ton iron hunks.

862
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:52,678
On these roads, it was suicide.

863
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:56,640
- You think this is any better?
- Sure it is.

864
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:45,147
- What does that mean?
- Who cares!

865
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:48,609
This is the end of the line for me.
- For you?

866
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:52,029
For you too. How do you expect
to get by here?

867
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,281
You can't fly over it!

868
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:57,034
Let's go back - right now.

869
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:15,970
Looks better over here.

870
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:19,473
We'll have to go
right to the edge.

871
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:22,184
The wood's completely rotten!

872
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:30,526
It's like a sponge!

873
01:31:35,365 --> 01:31:38,159
- Are you out of your mind?
- The others made it!

874
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,828
Our truck's twice as heavy.

875
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,746
The nitro's got to your brain!

876
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:47,293
Look at it.
Slippery as a skating rink.

877
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,129
You'll either go
through it or off it!

878
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:56,969
Listen to me, Jo.

879
01:31:57,137 --> 01:32:00,181
There's $2,000 waiting.
- I'd rather save my hide.

880
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,391
You should have thought
of that before.

881
01:32:02,559 --> 01:32:05,561
I didn't beg to come.
I told you I was scared.

882
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:09,023
"Don't worry, kid. I'll show you
how it's done." Remember?

883
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:11,483
We're going through.

884
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:15,905
- It's crazy!
- It was crazy taking on this job.

885
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:18,782
You got me into this -
don't forget that.

886
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:22,161
Now get back there
and guide me.

887
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:27,917
Poor sap!

888
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:30,794
You'll get a medal...

889
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:32,880
posthumously.

890
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,219
Ready.

891
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:40,512
Easy!

892
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,015
Easy!

893
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:06,330
Okay, hold it!

894
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:08,791
Hold it!

895
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:11,669
I said to the edge!

896
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,275
How much further?

897
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:53,919
My God!

898
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,329
Jo, answer me!

899
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:35,544
Stop kidding around!

900
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,386
What a spot!

901
01:35:14,084 --> 01:35:15,542
You louse!

902
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:21,757
Don't try to hide!

903
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:23,634
I see you!

904
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:29,348
I see you!
Get back down here, you bastard!

905
01:38:56,514 --> 01:38:58,432
Wait for me, Mario!

906
01:39:04,731 --> 01:39:06,481
Mario says, "Screw you!"

907
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:10,962
Well? You coming or not?

908
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:28,772
You low-down rat!

909
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:31,316
- Listen -
- I know.

910
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:32,734
You got the jitters.

911
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:34,361
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

912
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,321
Mr. Big Shot's got the shakes.

913
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,865
Some tough guy!

914
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:41,201
A real Al Capone!

915
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:45,122
Malaria, my ass!

916
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:49,126
You're scared stiff.
You're a woman.

917
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:51,670
Lay off! If you knew
what I've been through -

918
01:40:51,838 --> 01:40:53,422
Don't give me that!

919
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:57,342
Maybe you were a man once -
in my grandma's time.

920
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:01,722
Now you play it safe
and shoot a guy in the back

921
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:05,225
'cause you don't like risk.
- 'Cause I know what risk is.

922
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:09,563
You just plunge ahead.
You think you're invincible.

923
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:12,649
You can't see
10 feet ahead of you.

924
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,069
I see every pebble, every hole
that could send us sky-high.

925
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:20,157
I've died 50 times
since last night.

926
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:25,704
I can see the explosion up here.
I see myself blown to bits.

927
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:30,083
'Cause I've got brains
in my head!

928
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:34,004
If only you had balls too.

929
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:37,507
Keep talking.
Yours'll be hanging from a tree,

930
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:39,259
like a couple of cherries.

931
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:50,437
Hey, want a drag?

932
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:54,107
I'll buy you one
day after tomorrow.

933
01:41:54,817 --> 01:41:56,359
We'll each have one.

934
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,278
That's right.

935
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:01,156
Bimba, why are you so sad?

936
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:04,367
No more mixing cement.

937
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:06,119
We're gonna be rich...

938
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:08,789
if we don't die first.

939
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,082
And if we do,
it'll be over anyway.

940
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:16,254
But if we don't,
it'll be nice to get away.

941
01:42:16,422 --> 01:42:18,965
- Where to?
- Anywhere.

942
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,176
To swap mosquitoes?
No, thanks.

943
01:42:21,928 --> 01:42:23,887
The ones here are just fine.

944
01:42:24,931 --> 01:42:27,098
Those back home are better.

945
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:30,977
I'm going back to Calabria
with the dough.

946
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:32,896
I'll buy a house

947
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:37,442
and marry a pretty girl.

948
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:45,242
If you're scared,
you can get out.

949
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:47,577
This truck's not a rest home.

950
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:52,249
I'm staying.
I need to earn the dough.

951
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,751
Earn the dough?
I'm doing all the work.

952
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,087
I'm not some charity.

953
01:42:57,672 --> 01:43:00,006
I do the work, and you collect.

954
01:43:00,174 --> 01:43:02,676
$2,000 and so long!

955
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:07,013
You can forget that.
You've got to pump the pedal for it.

956
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,140
That's what they pay you for.

957
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:11,601
Think they pay you to drive?

958
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:13,770
They pay you to be terrified.

959
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:16,815
There's your division of labor.

960
01:43:16,983 --> 01:43:20,861
You drive and I worry myself shitless.
You got the better deal.

961
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:55,061
That's all we needed.

962
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:07,741
This is too much.

963
01:44:11,621 --> 01:44:13,371
We're jinxed!

964
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:19,085
Lousy rock!
How'd you ever get here?

965
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:21,671
It came from up there.

966
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:28,803
Goddamn rocks!

967
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:36,811
Rotten luck.

968
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:38,772
It's all over now!

969
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:40,523
Wait.

970
01:44:42,652 --> 01:44:44,903
We'll move it with a crowbar.

971
01:44:45,071 --> 01:44:48,031
You crazy?
It weighs at least 50 tons.

972
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,577
So what do we do?

973
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:00,877
We'll blow it up.

974
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:04,547
With what?

975
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:07,175
Think what we've got won't do it?

976
01:45:07,343 --> 01:45:09,886
A whole jerrican?

977
01:45:10,054 --> 01:45:13,139
A jerrican?
Why not a ton?

978
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:16,977
No, a quart will do it.

979
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:18,603
Thank God.

980
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:22,691
But how'll you get it out?

981
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:24,776
I'll siphon it out.

982
01:45:25,486 --> 01:45:29,656
Meanwhile, take this bar
and make me a hole -

983
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:35,829
A hole right in the stone.

984
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:38,623
About 30 inches deep.

985
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,077
That enough?

986
01:46:58,704 --> 01:47:02,415
Yeah. Now get me
the jack handle and the hammer.

987
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:04,060
What's going on, guys?

988
01:48:04,228 --> 01:48:07,147
- You got eyes.
- He's blowing it up.

989
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:09,190
What? You're nuts!

990
01:48:09,358 --> 01:48:11,401
Gotta clear the road, don't we?

991
01:48:12,778 --> 01:48:14,195
What do you say?

992
01:48:16,699 --> 01:48:17,782
Nothing.

993
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:21,619
Everyone gets his say here.
Even you.

994
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:25,081
I don't give a damn.

995
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:28,334
Isn't that a bit risky?

996
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:30,670
The whole load could blow,
and us with it.

997
01:48:30,838 --> 01:48:31,963
Of course.

998
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:36,509
We'll get the trucks out of the way.
Yours first.

999
01:48:36,677 --> 01:48:37,927
Then ours.

1000
01:48:39,597 --> 01:48:41,181
Hear that?

1001
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:43,391
Hey, big shot, you hear that?

1002
01:48:45,603 --> 01:48:47,812
Okay. Let's back it up.

1003
01:48:52,484 --> 01:48:54,194
What's with him?

1004
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:55,778
He's got the jitters.

1005
01:48:56,405 --> 01:48:59,532
If you need a tough guy,
he's all yours.

1006
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:01,701
Just look at him.

1007
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:04,662
Get going, you!

1008
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:12,212
Can't you see
he's just a walking corpse?

1009
01:49:12,379 --> 01:49:14,714
You think we're not?

1010
01:49:14,882 --> 01:49:19,219
Mario, get the jerrican
as far away as you can.

1011
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:23,932
Luigi, hand me the thermos.

1012
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:41,741
Is there enough in here?

1013
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:44,786
- Maybe too much.
- Pretty slick.

1014
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:47,956
It's simple.
I light the cord,

1015
01:49:48,749 --> 01:49:51,251
and when it reaches here,

1016
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,586
the hammer falls and - bingo!

1017
01:49:56,465 --> 01:49:58,925
Go find me a palm branch.

1018
01:50:28,455 --> 01:50:29,580
Here.

1019
01:50:32,543 --> 01:50:34,919
Okay. Now clear out.

1020
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:36,546
So this is it?

1021
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:40,216
First go back up the truck,

1022
01:50:41,719 --> 01:50:42,927
and then -

1023
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:46,973
We can't take
unnecessary risks.

1024
01:50:47,683 --> 01:50:49,309
So long.

1025
01:50:55,816 --> 01:50:57,233
Your cigar.

1026
01:51:23,886 --> 01:51:25,178
Stop!

1027
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,808
We're good here.

1028
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:34,145
Sure, we're great.

1029
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:16,729
Keep coming.

1030
01:52:31,495 --> 01:52:33,246
How's it going down there?

1031
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,081
Fine.

1032
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:18,416
It's taking a while.

1033
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:48,858
Take cover!

1034
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:56,907
The trucks!
What if rocks fall on 'em?

1035
01:55:57,075 --> 01:55:58,868
- Back 'em up more!
- Too late!

1036
01:55:59,828 --> 01:56:01,287
I'll put it out!

1037
01:56:01,455 --> 01:56:04,040
- Come with us!
- It's safer!

1038
01:56:16,762 --> 01:56:18,346
Get down, idiot!

1039
01:58:11,752 --> 01:58:13,335
Is he dead?

1040
01:58:14,171 --> 01:58:15,588
He's breathing!

1041
01:58:15,756 --> 01:58:18,215
Breathing the smell
of your stinkin' feet!

1042
01:58:19,259 --> 01:58:20,342
Bastard!

1043
01:58:20,677 --> 01:58:22,303
You had us worried!

1044
01:58:23,847 --> 01:58:27,266
Are you hurt?
- Wait. Let me see.

1045
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:31,771
You really scared us.
We thought you'd had it.

1046
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:34,940
So did I.

1047
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:48,078
Blessed are the poor in spirit.

1048
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:50,539
The blast just knocked him over.

1049
01:58:51,291 --> 01:58:53,083
And the rock too. Look.

1050
01:58:53,627 --> 01:58:55,503
Not a bad job at all.

1051
01:58:56,838 --> 01:58:58,297
Congratulations.

1052
01:58:58,507 --> 01:59:00,466
We do what we can.

1053
01:59:01,176 --> 01:59:03,177
- Nothing left.
- All gone.

1054
01:59:03,762 --> 01:59:05,346
See that?

1055
01:59:06,932 --> 01:59:08,724
This sure is twisted.

1056
01:59:09,309 --> 01:59:10,893
You're the twisted ones.

1057
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:13,771
It worked, didn't it?
So shut up.

1058
01:59:14,314 --> 01:59:15,940
Let's pour a toast.

1059
01:59:16,817 --> 01:59:19,151
If you're going,
I've gotta go too.

1060
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:20,903
Yeah, let's pour one.

1061
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:24,990
So I'm not invited, eh?

1062
01:59:28,662 --> 01:59:30,496
I'll make my own toast.

1063
01:59:45,846 --> 01:59:48,597
Careful. No shaking.

1064
01:59:48,849 --> 01:59:50,724
You sure are something.

1065
01:59:51,476 --> 01:59:53,727
Mario's got guts.
So have I.

1066
01:59:53,895 --> 01:59:55,688
Jo has none at all.

1067
01:59:55,856 --> 01:59:59,024
But you take the cake.

1068
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:02,361
Ever worked in a salt mine?

1069
02:00:03,071 --> 02:00:05,573
The Nazis gave me three years of it.

1070
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:08,409
I was half dead when I got out.

1071
02:00:08,952 --> 02:00:11,704
Compared to that,
a little nitroglycerine -

1072
02:00:11,872 --> 02:00:13,789
Sure, but even so.

1073
02:00:14,291 --> 02:00:15,749
Why shave?

1074
02:00:17,419 --> 02:00:18,878
Listen, Luigi.

1075
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:21,714
Before he was hanged,

1076
02:00:22,716 --> 02:00:26,176
my father asked to take a shower.

1077
02:00:27,512 --> 02:00:29,638
It runs in the family.

1078
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:32,433
I've never come to the table
without washing my hands.

1079
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:39,523
If I've gotta be a corpse,
I want to be...

1080
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:42,610
presentable.

1081
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:51,744
You should eat.

1082
02:00:52,495 --> 02:00:55,080
I couldn't eat
anything right now.

1083
02:00:57,918 --> 02:01:01,670
But I'd like a cold drink...

1084
02:01:02,422 --> 02:01:04,131
in a Paris bistro.

1085
02:01:04,299 --> 02:01:07,092
Want a smoke?
- Roll me one.

1086
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:16,268
Good old French tobacco

1087
02:01:17,103 --> 02:01:19,021
Ever hear that one?

1088
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:21,106
No, but you're off-key.

1089
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:23,192
That's 'cause
my conscience is clear.

1090
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:24,777
No kidding.

1091
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,926
No more Luigi.

1092
02:01:50,303 --> 02:01:54,014
Play with fire
and you end up getting burned!

1093
02:01:54,766 --> 02:01:56,642
It could have been us.

1094
02:01:57,644 --> 02:01:59,186
Poor guy.

1095
02:01:59,354 --> 02:02:01,397
Forget it.
They took a chance and lost.

1096
02:02:01,564 --> 02:02:03,315
That's life.

1097
02:02:03,483 --> 02:02:06,652
Your buddy goes up in smoke
and that's all you can say?

1098
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:08,445
What's it matter anyway?

1099
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:13,534
I'll smack you!
- Are you crazy?

1100
02:02:14,119 --> 02:02:16,036
Stop!

1101
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:21,333
- Shut the door.
- I've had it!

1102
02:03:01,499 --> 02:03:02,708
Drop it!

1103
02:03:02,876 --> 02:03:04,668
Drop the rock!

1104
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:06,086
You first!

1105
02:03:14,512 --> 02:03:16,138
Bastard!

1106
02:03:22,937 --> 02:03:26,315
It might not be right,
but I'm the strongest,

1107
02:03:26,483 --> 02:03:28,233
so it buys me some time.

1108
02:03:29,486 --> 02:03:30,527
Get up!

1109
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:46,126
Why are you so lousy to me?

1110
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:49,004
You still don't get it?

1111
02:03:49,756 --> 02:03:52,716
I need your help.
It's just you and me now.

1112
02:03:52,884 --> 02:03:55,010
So you're gonna stick with me

1113
02:03:55,929 --> 02:03:57,721
to the very end.

1114
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:00,933
Get back to the truck.

1115
02:04:07,148 --> 02:04:09,650
You're lucky I'm an old man!

1116
02:04:09,818 --> 02:04:11,860
I'm washed up, a coward!

1117
02:04:16,074 --> 02:04:16,949
Faster.

1118
02:04:38,805 --> 02:04:42,266
What an explosion.
Take a look at this.

1119
02:05:56,216 --> 02:05:58,091
It's like they just fell in.

1120
02:05:58,259 --> 02:06:00,928
The tracks go right
to the edge and stop.

1121
02:06:02,222 --> 02:06:03,764
Funny.

1122
02:06:03,932 --> 02:06:06,975
Like tracks of a plane
that took off.

1123
02:06:07,227 --> 02:06:09,061
That's just what happened.

1124
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:12,022
They took off.

1125
02:06:16,361 --> 02:06:18,237
I wonder what happened.

1126
02:06:18,404 --> 02:06:20,030
How would I know?

1127
02:06:21,532 --> 02:06:23,116
We'll never know.

1128
02:06:23,743 --> 02:06:25,661
I'm sure even they didn't know.

1129
02:06:45,932 --> 02:06:47,349
It's not deep.

1130
02:06:47,976 --> 02:06:49,601
But it'll rise.

1131
02:06:51,145 --> 02:06:53,146
Look at that.
Even the pipe's broken.

1132
02:06:53,314 --> 02:06:55,857
In half an hour
it'll be one big lake of oil.

1133
02:06:57,568 --> 02:07:00,737
We get all the lousy breaks!

1134
02:07:09,122 --> 02:07:10,289
Look.

1135
02:07:10,456 --> 02:07:12,040
Bimba's cigarette holder.

1136
02:07:13,459 --> 02:07:15,085
That's all that's left.

1137
02:07:15,628 --> 02:07:19,256
Okay. Let's go.
Otherwise we'll need a boat.

1138
02:07:21,009 --> 02:07:24,136
Test the bottom
while I get the truck.

1139
02:07:47,327 --> 02:07:50,078
I'll be back in two minutes.

1140
02:07:51,122 --> 02:07:52,664
Yeah, yeah.

1141
02:07:53,958 --> 02:07:56,668
Two minutes, next year -
what's it matter now?

1142
02:08:14,395 --> 02:08:15,979
Well?

1143
02:08:18,649 --> 02:08:20,067
It's slick.

1144
02:08:21,069 --> 02:08:23,070
I said it's slick.

1145
02:08:23,237 --> 02:08:26,990
You'll spin out. If you stop,
you'll never get started again.

1146
02:08:28,743 --> 02:08:30,369
We got no choice.

1147
02:08:32,205 --> 02:08:33,163
Okay.

1148
02:08:34,957 --> 02:08:36,833
Just don't stop!

1149
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:38,418
I'm right behind you.

1150
02:09:09,742 --> 02:09:12,202
- It's deep.
- Keep going.

1151
02:09:21,254 --> 02:09:23,130
Hurry up!

1152
02:09:26,801 --> 02:09:28,718
Wait, wait!

1153
02:09:42,442 --> 02:09:43,358
Stop!

1154
02:09:43,526 --> 02:09:45,861
Get out of the way!

1155
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:48,238
I can't!

1156
02:09:48,448 --> 02:09:49,990
I'm stuck!

1157
02:09:51,451 --> 02:09:52,451
Move!

1158
02:09:54,871 --> 02:09:56,788
Mario, stop!

1159
02:11:40,893 --> 02:11:43,103
My leg!

1160
02:11:43,271 --> 02:11:46,648
Why didn't you get out of the way?
Don't we have enough problems?

1161
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:50,443
You bastard. You knew
you were running over me.

1162
02:11:50,611 --> 02:11:53,238
But you ran
right over your buddy.

1163
02:11:53,406 --> 02:11:55,907
Buddy or not, I had to.

1164
02:11:59,787 --> 02:12:01,413
You're hurting me!

1165
02:12:10,256 --> 02:12:12,757
It's your fault. I told you
to get out of the way.

1166
02:12:12,925 --> 02:12:14,301
If I hadn't hesitated -

1167
02:12:14,468 --> 02:12:16,219
- You did?
- Yes, I did!

1168
02:12:16,387 --> 02:12:18,305
If not, I'd have made it.

1169
02:12:18,556 --> 02:12:21,016
Now we're stuck
on account of you.

1170
02:12:21,183 --> 02:12:23,018
Out of the running.

1171
02:12:23,603 --> 02:12:28,148
And not even blown up -
just stuck in the mud.

1172
02:12:28,316 --> 02:12:29,774
Some heroes!

1173
02:12:30,192 --> 02:12:33,612
Do something.
You can't imagine the pain!

1174
02:12:33,779 --> 02:12:35,530
Like I've got the time.

1175
02:12:37,867 --> 02:12:39,284
I'm in agony!

1176
02:12:40,536 --> 02:12:43,204
Here's your chance
to take it easy.

1177
02:12:43,372 --> 02:12:45,749
It's just what you wanted!

1178
02:13:29,168 --> 02:13:31,086
Hurry up. This is bad.

1179
02:16:15,334 --> 02:16:16,876
The ride too rough for you?

1180
02:16:17,044 --> 02:16:19,170
I'm not made of nitroglycerine.

1181
02:16:19,839 --> 02:16:21,464
I'm not dangerous.

1182
02:16:23,175 --> 02:16:24,592
Not anymore.

1183
02:16:31,183 --> 02:16:32,934
Stinks in here, doesn't it?

1184
02:16:33,102 --> 02:16:34,269
Yeah.

1185
02:16:36,188 --> 02:16:39,148
- It's my leg.
- Come off it.

1186
02:16:39,316 --> 02:16:40,942
It's just the oil.

1187
02:16:42,653 --> 02:16:45,029
It's me.
I smell like rotting flesh.

1188
02:16:45,197 --> 02:16:46,823
Stop talking nonsense.

1189
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:50,702
It's terrible to rot alive.

1190
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:53,496
Get all worked up
and you're done for.

1191
02:16:53,706 --> 02:16:55,790
Look at my nails.

1192
02:16:55,958 --> 02:16:57,542
They're purple.

1193
02:16:59,461 --> 02:17:01,421
This is the end.

1194
02:17:01,589 --> 02:17:05,383
Stop it, all right? You're not gonna
let yourself die, are you?

1195
02:17:06,427 --> 02:17:08,303
It's out of my hands.

1196
02:17:22,276 --> 02:17:24,068
Talk to me, Jo.
Say something.

1197
02:17:24,737 --> 02:17:26,404
I feel like sleeping.

1198
02:17:26,572 --> 02:17:28,948
No, you gotta keep on fighting!

1199
02:17:29,116 --> 02:17:30,992
I'm tired.

1200
02:17:32,995 --> 02:17:35,496
You gotta force yourself.

1201
02:17:36,957 --> 02:17:40,084
Come on, Jo.
- What do you wanna talk about?

1202
02:17:40,377 --> 02:17:42,462
Anything you like.

1203
02:17:44,006 --> 02:17:45,590
Where did you live in Paris?

1204
02:17:48,010 --> 02:17:49,594
On the rue Galande.

1205
02:17:50,429 --> 02:17:53,097
No kidding.
I know that street.

1206
02:17:53,265 --> 02:17:55,099
That was a long time ago.

1207
02:17:55,768 --> 02:17:57,352
That's funny.

1208
02:17:58,145 --> 02:18:00,730
You remember
the tobacco shop on the corner?

1209
02:18:00,898 --> 02:18:03,608
- Is it still there?
- Sure is.

1210
02:18:04,902 --> 02:18:06,653
Next to the hardware store.

1211
02:18:07,738 --> 02:18:11,824
In my time,
there was a fence there.

1212
02:18:11,992 --> 02:18:15,536
No, you're right.
There's a fence.

1213
02:18:15,704 --> 02:18:19,499
I never knew
what was beyond it.

1214
02:18:20,334 --> 02:18:22,460
Nothing. Just an empty lot.

1215
02:18:25,923 --> 02:18:29,217
- Feeling worse?
- I'm okay.

1216
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:33,972
What a long street.

1217
02:18:34,807 --> 02:18:36,557
I'm all out of breath.

1218
02:19:14,013 --> 02:19:15,805
Jo, old buddy.

1219
02:19:16,682 --> 02:19:18,182
Hold on.

1220
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:20,101
We're almost there.

1221
02:19:25,649 --> 02:19:27,233
You asleep?

1222
02:19:29,319 --> 02:19:30,903
I'm trying to remember.

1223
02:19:32,948 --> 02:19:34,115
What?

1224
02:19:35,868 --> 02:19:37,493
The fence.

1225
02:19:39,371 --> 02:19:42,081
What was beyond the fence?

1226
02:19:42,249 --> 02:19:44,000
I told you: nothing.

1227
02:19:45,878 --> 02:19:46,836
Nothing.

1228
02:19:53,844 --> 02:19:55,428
There's nothing!

1229
02:20:17,409 --> 02:20:19,160
Look, we made it!

1230
02:20:31,423 --> 02:20:32,840
Old pal.

1231
02:20:37,262 --> 02:20:38,888
That's right.

1232
02:20:39,973 --> 02:20:41,599
Take a little nap.

1233
02:20:44,978 --> 02:20:46,938
Not like that.
It scares me.

1234
02:22:54,066 --> 02:22:55,775
Amazing!

1235
02:22:57,027 --> 02:22:58,903
Tell me, what was it like?

1236
02:25:34,226 --> 02:25:37,103
Hello? What?

1237
02:25:39,648 --> 02:25:41,065
It can't be.

1238
02:25:41,233 --> 02:25:45,444
Bad news. Luigi and Bimba
were blown up. Jo's dead.

1239
02:25:45,612 --> 02:25:48,781
- What about Mario?
- He'll be here in two hours.

1240
02:25:48,949 --> 02:25:51,575
Are you sure?

1241
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:54,495
Praise God!

1242
02:25:54,746 --> 02:25:57,946
Doc, did you hear that?
He'll be here in two hours!
