1
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,802
Anything goes

2
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,271
Anything goes

3
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,542
Anything goes

4
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,252
Anything goes.

5
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,607
Be careful.

6
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,667
You never told me you spoke
my language, Dr. Jones.

7
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,670
Only on special occasions.

8
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,089
So, it is true?

9
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,800
You found Nurhachi?

10
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,635
You know I did.

11
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,055
Last night one of your boys
tried to get Nurhachi

12
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,557
without paying for him.

13
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,559
You have insulted my son.

14
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,769
No, you have insulted me.

15
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,188
I spared his life.

16
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,983
Aren't you going to introduce us?

17
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,321
This is Willie Scott.

18
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,784
This is Indiana Jones,
famous archeologist.

19
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,455
Well, I thought archeologists
were always funny little men

20
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,665
searching for their mommies.

21
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,000
Mummies.

22
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,711
Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me,

23
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,798
and he's going to deliver him now.

24
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,218
Say, who is this Nurhachi?

25
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,846
Put the gun away, sonny.

26
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,394
I suggest you give me what you owe me

27
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,729
or anything goes.

28
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,824
Open it.

29
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,374
The diamond, Lao.

30
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,211
The deal was for the diamond.

31
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,902
Oh, Lao...

32
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,366
To your very good health.

33
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,409
Lao! He put a hole...

34
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,830
He put two holes
in my dress from Paris!

35
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,248
Sit down!

36
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:39,922
Now, you bring me Nurhachi.

37
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,007
My pleasure.

38
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,510
Who on Earth is this Nurhachi?

39
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,349
Here he is.

40
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,273
This Nurhachi's a real small guy.

41
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,320
Inside are the remains of Nurhachi,

42
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,783
first Emperor of Manchu Dynasty.

43
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,452
Welcome home, old boy.

44
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,799
And now, you give me the diamond.

45
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,760
Are you trying to develop
a sense of humor,

46
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,721
or am I going deaf?

47
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,436
What's that?

48
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,396
Antidote.

49
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,398
To what?

50
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,235
The poison you just drank, Dr. Jones.

51
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,659
The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.

52
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,961
- Lao.
- Lao!

53
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,131
You keep the girl. I find another.

54
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,970
Good service here.

55
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,764
That's not a waiter.

56
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,850
Wu Han's an old friend.
Game's not over, Lao.

57
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,144
Antidote.

58
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,202
Indy...

59
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,291
Don't worry, Wu Han,
I'll get you out of here.

60
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,543
Not this time, Indy.

61
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,964
I followed you on many adventures,

62
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:49,218
but into the great unknown mystery,
I go first, Indy.

63
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,016
Don't be sad, Dr. Jones.

64
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,644
You will soon be joining him.

65
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,944
Too much to drink, Dr. Jones?

66
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,289
Oh, nuts!

67
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,343
- The antidote.
- Where's the diamond?

68
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,916
No!

69
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,338
Stay there!

70
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,381
Come on.

71
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,385
I don't want to die!

72
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,231
Who are you?

73
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,863
Wow! Holy smoke!

74
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,447
Crash landing!

75
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,159
Short Round, step on it.

76
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,328
Okeydokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.

77
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,039
For crying out loud,
there's a kid driving the car!

78
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,849
Wow! Wow.

79
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,353
Where's the antidote? Let me have it.

80
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,771
Listen, I just met you, for Christ's sakes.

81
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,565
Give me...

82
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,025
I'm not that kind of girl.

83
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,319
Hey, Dr. Jones, no time for love.

84
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,237
We got company.

85
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,368
Oh, I hope you choke.

86
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,874
No shooting.

87
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,183
Okay, you asked for it.

88
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,580
This is fun!

89
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,500
Here, hold this.

90
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,008
Where's my gun? Where's my gun?

91
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,886
I burned my fingers,
and I cracked a nail!

92
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,731
Dr. Jones... I'm Art Weber.

93
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,441
I spoke with your assistant.

94
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,527
We've managed to secure three seats,

95
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,404
but there might be
a slight inconvenience

96
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,116
as you will be riding
on a cargo full of live poultry.

97
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Is he kidding?

98
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,661
Madam, it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

99
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,332
Heavens, aren't you Willie Scott,
the famous American female vocalist?

100
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,961
Owe you a gin.

101
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,638
Nice try, Lao Che.

102
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,271
Good-bye, Dr. Jones.

103
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,311
So, what are you supposed to be,
a lion tamer?

104
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,147
I'm allowing you to tag along,

105
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,275
so why don't you give
your mouth a rest?

106
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,652
Okay, doll?

107
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,821
What do you mean, "tag along"?

108
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,448
Ever since you got into my club,

109
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,658
you haven't been able
to take your eyes off me.

110
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,243
Oh, yeah?

111
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,674
Oh, no.

112
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,094
Oh, no! Mister, mister...

113
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,846
Oh, mister, wake up. Please, mister...

114
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,848
You call him Dr. Jones, doll!

115
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,518
Okay, Dr. Jones, Dr. Jones.
Oh, wake up, please!

116
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,479
Are we there already? Oh, good.

117
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,730
No.

118
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,569
- No one's flying the plane!
- Oh, boy...

119
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,405
They've all gone!

120
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,495
You know how to fly, don't you?

121
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,246
No. Do you?

122
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,706
Oh, no.

123
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,208
- Oh, my God!
- How hard can it be?

124
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,418
- I'm gonna faint.
- Altimeter! Okay.

125
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,837
Air speed. Okay.

126
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:46,922
Fuel...

127
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,216
Fuel?

128
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,051
Fuel?

129
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,150
I think we got a big problem.

130
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,735
- Dr. Jones!
- Shorty!

131
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,696
Dr. Jones! No more parachutes!

132
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,449
Shorty!

133
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,117
- Come on, give me a hand!
- What's that?

134
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,536
Move the box!

135
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,496
Dr. Jones, you're crazy!

136
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,794
Shorty, get our stuff!

137
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,426
A boat? We're not sinking.

138
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,262
We're crashing!

139
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,431
Grab on, Shorty! Grab on!

140
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,684
- Lady, I can't breathe!
- Tight!

141
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,725
Slow it down!

142
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,812
That wasn't so bad, was it?

143
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,995
Put on the brakes!

144
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:48,710
I hate the water, and I hate being wet,

145
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,920
and I hate you!

146
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,048
Good. Good!

147
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,949
Dr. Jones?

148
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,535
I'm all right, Shorty.

149
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,162
You okay?

150
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,256
Where are we, anyway?

151
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,805
India.

152
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,390
How do you know that?

153
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,629
I sure hope this means dinner.

154
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,380
God, I'm starving.

155
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,549
Thank you.

156
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,308
I can't eat this.

157
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,979
That's more food
than these people eat in a week.

158
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,564
They're starving.

159
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,483
Oh, I'm sorry. You can have...

160
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,776
Eat it.

161
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,988
I'm not hungry.

162
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,118
You're insulting them,
and you're embarrassing me.

163
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,247
- Eat it.
- Eat it.

164
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,873
Eat.

165
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,889
Bad news coming.

166
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,644
Can you provide us with a guide
to take us to Delhi?

167
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,564
I'm a professor.
I have to get back to my university.

168
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,858
Yes. Sajnu will guide you.

169
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:47,615
On the way to Delhi,
you will stop at Pankot.

170
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,411
Pankot is not on the way to Delhi.

171
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,746
You will go to Pankot Palace.

172
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,624
I thought the palace had been deserted
since the 1850s.

173
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,502
No. Now there is a new Maharajah,

174
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:04,632
and again the palace
has the power of the Dark Light.

175
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,428
It is that place kill my people.

176
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,763
What has happened here?

177
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,974
The evil start in Pankot,

178
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,852
then like monsoon,

179
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,481
it moves darkness

180
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,486
over all country,

181
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,989
over all country.

182
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,824
The evil?

183
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,412
What evil?

184
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,164
See? Bad news.

185
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,667
You listen to Suwamu. You leave Lanka.

186
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,005
They came from palace

187
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:50,136
and took Sivalinga from our village.

188
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,388
Took what?

189
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,265
It's a stone, a sacred stone

190
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,184
from a shrine that protects the village.

191
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,020
It is why Siva brought you here.

192
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,740
We weren't brought here.

193
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,117
Our plane crashed.

194
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,078
It crashed.

195
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,704
No, no.

196
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:22,543
We prayed to Siva to help us
find the stone.

197
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:28,841
It was Siva who made you fall
from the sky.

198
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,723
So you will go to Pankot Palace
to find Sivalinga

199
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,351
and bring back to us.

200
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,895
Bring back to us.

201
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,981
Bring back to us.

202
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,233
Bring back to us.

203
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,112
Dr. Jones, did they make
the plane crash

204
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,822
to get you here?

205
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,159
No, Shorty, it's just a ghost story.
Don't worry about it.

206
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,791
They took the stone from here.

207
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,675
Was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river?

208
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,843
Yes.

209
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,803
With three lines across it

210
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,346
representing the three levels
of the universe.

211
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,015
- That's right.
- Yes.

212
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,809
I've seen stones like the one you lost.

213
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,063
But why would Maharajah
take the sacred stone from here?

214
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,734
They says we must pray
to their evil god.

215
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,237
We says we will not.

216
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,490
Excuse me, I don't understand
how one rock

217
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,242
could destroy a whole village.

218
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,999
He's saying when
the sacred stone was taken,

219
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,626
the village wells dried up,
and the river turned to sand.

220
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,341
The crops were swallowed by the earth,

221
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,636
and the animals laid down
and turned to dust.

222
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,307
Then one night
there was a fire in the fields.

223
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,019
The men went out to fight the fire.

224
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,230
When they came back,
the women were crying in the darkness.

225
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,493
Children.

226
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,205
He says they stole their children.

227
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,840
Sankara! Sankara...

228
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,053
Ranjit!

229
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,140
Ranjit!

230
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,292
Sankara.

231
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,436
Little boy escaped from the evil palace.

232
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,315
Many other children still there.

233
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,442
What we do, Dr. Jones?

234
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,285
What you think?

235
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,999
I think that somebody believes
the good luck rock from this village

236
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,543
is one of the lost Sankara Stones.

237
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,253
What is Sankara?

238
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,673
Fortune and glory, kid.

239
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,968
Fortune and glory.

240
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,204
Willie, quit monkeying around
on that thing.

241
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,298
Oh, wait a second! Indy!

242
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,634
I can't go to Delhi like this!

243
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,680
We're not going to Delhi, doll.
We're going to Pankot Palace.

244
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,348
Pankot?

245
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,850
I can't go to Pankot! I'm a singer.

246
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,561
Oh, I need to call my agent.
Is there a phone?

247
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,313
Anybody, I need a phone!

248
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,200
Oh, quit complaining.
This is expensive stuff.

249
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,371
You come to America with me,
and we get job in circus.

250
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,582
You like that? You like America?

251
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,542
You're my best friend.

252
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,627
You're my best friend.

253
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,964
What big birds!

254
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,134
Those aren't big birds, sweetheart.

255
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,762
They're giant vampire bats.

256
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,764
Bats?

257
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,484
Pipe down, you big baboon.
This doesn't hurt.

258
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,987
You know what you really need?
You really need a bath.

259
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,207
Ha-ha, very funny.

260
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,876
Very funny.

261
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,128
Very funny.

262
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,797
All wet.

263
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,425
I was happy in Shanghai.

264
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,805
I had a little house and a garden.

265
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,182
My friends were rich.

266
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,643
We went to parties
all the time in limousines.

267
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,937
I hate being outside!

268
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,692
I'm a singer! I could lose my voice!

269
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,823
I think we'll camp here tonight.

270
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,118
Cut it out.

271
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,209
- What do you got?
- Two sixes.

272
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,962
Aha-ha, three aces. I win.

273
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,673
Two more game, I have all your money.

274
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,553
It's poker, Shorty, anything can happen.

275
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,556
Where did you find
your little bodyguard?

276
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,016
I didn't find him, I caught him.

277
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,226
What?

278
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,563
Shorty's family were killed
when the Japanese bombed Shanghai.

279
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,648
He's been living on the streets
since he was four.

280
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,444
I caught him trying to pick my pocket,
didn't I, short stuff?

281
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,158
Biggest trouble with her is the noise.

282
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,127
Hey! You cheat, Dr. Jones. You cheat!

283
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,753
- What do you mean?
- You take four card.

284
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,632
- You pay now.
- Oh, they were stuck together.

285
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,009
- No stuck. No mistake.
- They were stuck together.

286
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,135
It's a mistake.

287
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,262
I'm very little. You cheat very big.

288
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,348
Dr. Jones, you cheat!

289
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,267
You pay money. You owe me ten cent.

290
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,978
Look at this. Look at this.

291
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,567
You accuse me of cheating.
You're cheating.

292
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,783
You make me poor. No fun.

293
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,577
Play with you no fun.

294
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,538
- I quit.
- I quit, too.

295
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,749
This place is completely surrounded.

296
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,043
The entire place is crawling
with living things.

297
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,504
That's why they call it
the jungle, sweetheart.

298
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,088
Oh, my God, what else is out there?

299
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,798
Willie, wait...

300
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,597
Willie, Willie...

301
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,391
What is that?
Is that short for something?

302
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:43,312
"Willie" is my professional name,
Indiana.

303
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,524
Hey, lady, you call him Dr. Jones.

304
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,442
My professional name.

305
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,863
Why are you dragging us off
to this deserted palace?

306
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,573
Fortune and glory?

307
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,075
Fortune and glory.

308
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,078
Well...

309
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,789
this is a piece of an old manuscript.

310
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,876
This pictograph represents Sankara,
a priest.

311
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,127
Scram.

312
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,006
Gentle. Gentle.
This is hundreds of years old.

313
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,466
Is that some kind of writing?

314
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,134
Yeah, it's Sanskrit.

315
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,219
Cut it out.

316
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,721
It's part of the legend of Sankara.

317
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,182
He climbs Mount Kalisa
where he meets Siva,

318
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,684
the Hindu god.

319
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,812
That's Siva?
And what's he handing the priest?

320
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,147
- Rocks.
- Stop.

321
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,693
He told him to go forth and combat evil.

322
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,153
And to help him,
he gave him five sacred stones

323
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,989
with magical properties.

324
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,574
Magic rocks?

325
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,075
My grandpa was a magician.

326
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,452
He spent his entire life
with a rabbit in his pocket

327
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,537
and pigeons up his sleeves.

328
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,957
He made a lot of children happy
and died a very poor man.

329
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,085
Magic rocks. Fortune and glory.

330
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,129
Sweet dreams, Dr. Jones.

331
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,715
Where are you going?

332
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,134
I'd sleep closer, if I were you.

333
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,678
For safety's sake.

334
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,181
Dr. Jones, I'd be safer
sleeping with a snake.

335
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,769
I said, cut it out!

336
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,775
I hate that elephant.

337
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,639
Indy, look!

338
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,393
I see it, Shorty. That's it. Pankot Palace.

339
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,141
Dr. Jones, what you look at?

340
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,144
Don't come up here.

341
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,402
No! No, no, no, no! Don't leave! No!

342
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,405
No, no, no, no, no!

343
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,240
Oh, baby elephant, stay here!

344
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,117
Oh, no! Indy!

345
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,786
They're stealing our rides!

346
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,830
We walk from here.

347
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,785
Hello.

348
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,579
I should say you look rather lost.

349
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,832
But then I cannot imagine
where in the world

350
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,918
the three of you would look at home.

351
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,629
We're not lost.
We're on our way to Delhi.

352
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,631
This is Miss Scott.

353
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,508
This is Mr. Round.

354
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:23,967
Short Round.

355
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,886
My name is Indiana Jones.

356
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,306
Dr. Jones, the eminent archeologist?

357
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,558
Hard to believe, isn't it?

358
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,979
I remember first hearing your name
when I was up at Oxford.

359
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,149
I'm Chattar Lal,
Prime Minister to His Highness,

360
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,109
the Maharajah of Pankot.

361
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,070
I'm enchanted.

362
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,323
Enchanted. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

363
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,408
Welcome to Pankot Palace!

364
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,247
Enchanted, huh?

365
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,094
Shorty, where's my razor?

366
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:36,373
We are fortunate tonight
to have so many unexpected visitors.

367
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,500
- This is Captain...
- ...Blumburtt.

368
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,043
11th Poona Rifles.

369
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,005
And you, sir, are Dr. Jones, I presume.

370
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,590
I am, Captain.

371
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:48,719
Captain Blumburtt and his troops
are on a routine inspection tour.

372
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,347
The British find it amusing
to inspect us at their convenience.

373
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:56,852
I do hope, sir, that it's not
inconvenient to you, sir.

374
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,564
The British worry so about their empire.

375
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,650
Makes us all feel like
well-cared-for children.

376
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,330
You look beautiful.

377
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,207
I think the Maharajah
is swimming in loot.

378
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:22,836
Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
coming here after all.

379
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,213
You look like a princess.

380
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:29,009
Mr. Lal, what do they call
the Maharajah's wife?

381
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,179
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.

382
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,347
How interesting.

383
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,433
Well, maybe it's because
he hasn't found the right woman.

384
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,282
His Supreme Highness,

385
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,911
guardian of Pankot tradition,

386
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,706
the Maharajah of Pankot,

387
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,876
Zalim Singh.

388
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,441
That's the Maharajah?

389
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,235
A kid?

390
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,198
Maybe he like older women.

391
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,625
Captain Blumburtt was just telling me

392
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,169
something of the interesting
history of the palace,

393
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,880
the importance it played in the mutiny.

394
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:53,218
It seems the British never forget
the Mutiny of 1857.

395
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,680
Yes, well, you know, I think
there are other events,

396
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,974
before the mutiny, going back a century,

397
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,852
back to the time of Clive,
that are more interesting.

398
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,354
And what events are those, Dr. Jones?

399
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,691
Well, if memory serves me correctly,
this area, this province,

400
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,610
was the center of activity
for the Thuggee.

401
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,574
Snake... Surprise.

402
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,868
What's the surprise?

403
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,380
Dr. Jones, you know perfectly well

404
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,924
the Thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century.

405
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,634
Yes, of course.

406
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,137
The Thuggee was an obscenity

407
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,307
that worshipped Kali
with human sacrifices.

408
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,435
The British Army
nicely did away with them.

409
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,983
Well, I suppose stories
of the Thuggee die hard.

410
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,277
There are no stories anymore.

411
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,654
I'm not so sure.

412
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,407
We came from a small village.

413
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,658
The peasants there told us

414
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,078
Pankot Palace was growing
powerful again

415
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,330
because of some ancient evil.

416
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,582
Village stories, Dr. Jones.

417
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,418
They're just fear and folklore.

418
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,173
You're beginning to worry
Captain Blumburtt.

419
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:19,429
I'm not worried, Mr. Prime Minister,
just interested.

420
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,823
What? You are not eating?

421
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,535
I had bugs for lunch.

422
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,915
Give me your hat.

423
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,709
Why?

424
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,920
'Cause I'm gonna puke in it.

425
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,218
You know, the villagers also told us
Pankot Palace had taken something.

426
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,263
Dr. Jones, in our country,

427
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,599
it's not usual for a guest
to insult his host.

428
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,018
I'm sorry.

429
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,938
I thought we were talking about folklore.

430
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:14,067
Excuse me, sir,
do you have anything simple, like soup?

431
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,947
What exactly was it
they say was stolen?

432
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,491
A sacred rock.

433
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,746
You see, Captain, a rock!

434
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,932
Something connected the villagers' rock

435
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,102
and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones.

436
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:53,440
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors.

437
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,109
I seem to remember that in Honduras

438
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,236
you were accused of being
a grave robber

439
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,030
rather than an archeologist.

440
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,450
Well, the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident.

441
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,786
And wasn't it the Sultan of Madagascar
who threatened to cut your head off

442
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,205
if you ever returned to his country?

443
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,331
No, it wasn't my head.

444
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,707
Then your hands, perhaps.

445
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,792
No, it wasn't my hands,

446
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:13,960
it was my...

447
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,630
My misunderstanding.

448
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,007
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.

449
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,969
I have heard the evil stories
of the Thuggee cult.

450
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:26,306
I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.

451
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,060
Later, I learnt
the Thuggee cult was once real

452
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,479
and did of unspeakable things.

453
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,566
I am ashamed of what happened here
so many years ago,

454
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:37,984
and I assure you

455
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:42,155
this will never happen again
in my kingdom.

456
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,908
If I offended you,

457
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,619
then I am sorry.

458
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,507
Dessert!

459
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,522
Chilled monkey brains.

460
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,956
I think I'll just check on Willie.

461
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,459
That's all you better do.

462
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,714
Tell me later what happened.

463
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,465
Am-scray.

464
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,061
I've got something for you.

465
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:59,399
There's nothing you have
that I could possibly want.

466
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,942
Right.

467
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,790
You're a very nice man.

468
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,543
Maybe you could be my palace slave.

469
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,847
Wear your jewels to bed, Princess?

470
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,974
Yeah.

471
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,102
And nothing else.

472
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,104
That shock you?

473
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,856
Nothing shocks me.

474
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,525
I'm a scientist.

475
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,404
So, as a scientist,
you do a lot of research?

476
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,865
Always.

477
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,451
And what sort of research
would you do on me?

478
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,456
Nocturnal activities.

479
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,584
You mean like what sort of cream
I put on my face at night,

480
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,336
what position I like to sleep in?

481
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,879
Mating customs.

482
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,005
Love rituals?

483
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,008
Primitive sexual practices.

484
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,802
So you're an authority in that area?

485
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,553
Years of fieldwork.

486
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,649
I don't blame you for being sore at me.

487
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,402
I can be hard to handle.

488
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,113
I've had worse.

489
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,949
But you'll never have better.

490
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,620
I don't know.

491
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,956
As a scientist,
I don't want to prejudice my experiment.

492
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,707
I'll let you know in the morning.

493
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,378
Why, you conceited ape.

494
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,713
I'm not that easy.

495
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,426
I'm not that easy, either.

496
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,553
Trouble with you is, Willie,

497
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,847
you're too used to getting your own way.

498
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,932
And you're just too proud to admit

499
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,185
that you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones.

500
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,730
If you want me, Willie,
you know where you can find me.

501
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,774
Five minutes.

502
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,860
You'll be back over here in five minutes.

503
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,486
I'll be asleep in five minutes.

504
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:09,779
Five.

505
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,198
You know it, and I know it.

506
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,882
Five minutes.

507
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,052
Four and a half.

508
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,108
"Palace slave."

509
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,736
"Nocturnal activities."

510
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,281
I'm a "conceited ape"?

511
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,367
"I'll tell you in the morning."

512
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,995
I can't believe it.

513
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,622
He's not coming.

514
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,707
She's not coming.

515
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,503
I can't believe I'm not going.

516
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,316
Indiana Jones!

517
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,069
This is one night you'll never forget!

518
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,239
This is the night
I slipped right through your fingers!

519
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,617
Sleep tight,

520
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,369
and pleasant dreams!

521
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,958
I could have been
your greatest adventure.

522
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:38,678
Dr. Jones, your whip!

523
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,284
Shorty,

524
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,493
turn off the switch.

525
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,251
Indy.

526
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,587
Be gentle with me.

527
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,339
Be gentle with me.

528
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,138
But I'm here.

529
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:34,901
There's nobody here.

530
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,236
No, I'm here.

531
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:41,032
Indy, you're acting awfully strange.

532
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,894
Hey, I'm right here.

533
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,244
"Follow in the footsteps of Siva."

534
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,246
What does that mean?

535
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,627
"Do not betray these truths."

536
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:37,296
Shorty, go get our stuff.

537
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,494
Stay behind me, Short Round.

538
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:13,082
Step where I step,
and don't touch anything.

539
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,054
I step where you step.

540
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,098
I touch nothing.

541
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,351
Indy!

542
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,749
I step on something.

543
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,211
Yeah, there's something on the ground.

544
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,630
Feel like step on fortune cookies.

545
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,425
It's not fortune cookies.

546
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,221
Let me take a look.

547
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,277
That's no cookies.

548
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,738
It's all right. I got him.

549
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,035
Go. There, go.

550
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,076
Stop.

551
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,413
Look, just stand up against the wall,
will you?

552
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,555
You say to stand against the wall!

553
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,973
I listen to what you say!

554
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,142
- Not my fault! Not my fault!
- Willie, get down here!

555
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,102
We're in trouble!

556
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,063
Willie! Willie!

557
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,733
Bet I get all dirty again.

558
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,735
- Willie, get down here!
- Not my fault!

559
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,903
We're in trouble!

560
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,281
Trouble? Trouble? What sort of...

561
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,340
This is serious!

562
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,801
There are two dead people down here!

563
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:14,138
There're going to be
two dead people in here! Hurry!

564
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,390
I've almost had enough of you two.

565
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,725
Willie!

566
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,518
What's the rush?

567
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,813
It's a long story, Willie.
Hurry, or you don't get to hear it.

568
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,610
God, what is this?

569
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,155
Indy, what is this?

570
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,532
I can't see a thing!

571
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,451
Hurry!

572
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,161
All right!

573
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,663
I broke a nail.

574
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,804
Willie, hurry!

575
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,889
They're in my hair!

576
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,724
Shut up, Willie!

577
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,520
- Indy, let me in!
- No, let us out!

578
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,647
- Let me in!
- Let us out!

579
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,440
- Shut up!
- I'm down here!

580
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:07,900
They're all over me!

581
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:11,320
There's got to be
a fulcrum release lever somewhere.

582
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,405
What?

583
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,407
A handle that opens the door.

584
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,325
- Go on!
- They're just, just square holes!

585
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,994
Go to the right hole.

586
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,705
Hurry, Willie!

587
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,589
The other one! The other right.
Your other right!

588
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,092
- The one on your right!
- There's slime inside!

589
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,052
I can't do it.

590
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,179
You can do it. Feel inside.

591
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,597
Okay.

592
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,269
You feel inside!

593
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,229
Do it now!

594
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,689
Okay!

595
00:58:55,866 --> 00:59:00,453
Willie, we are going to die!

596
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,205
It's soft.

597
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,376
It's moving!

598
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,594
Got it!

599
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,235
Get 'em off of me! Get 'em off of me!

600
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:36,155
They're all over me! Get 'em off me!

601
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,117
No!

602
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,080
It wasn't me! It's her!

603
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,249
Come on!

604
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:50,544
Go! Move! Come on, move! Come on!

605
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,482
It's a Thuggee ceremony.

606
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,067
They're worshipping Kali.

607
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,288
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

608
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,582
Nobody's seen this for a hundred years.

609
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:49,390
Kali Ma. Kali Ma...

610
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,517
Kali Ma!

611
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,014
He's still alive.

612
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,600
Kali Ma.

613
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:01,123
That's the rock
they took from the village.

614
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,709
It's one of the Sankara Stones.

615
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,926
Why they glow like that?

616
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,513
The legend says

617
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:17,848
when the rocks are brought together,

618
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,309
the diamonds inside them will glow.

619
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,019
Diamonds?

620
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,187
Diamonds.

621
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:24,480
Diamonds!

622
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:25,606
Diamonds.

623
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:43,999
Hey, hey.

624
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:47,836
Look, I want you two
to stay up here and keep quiet.

625
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,254
Shorty, you keep an eye on her.

626
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,048
- Why, where are you going?
- Down there.

627
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:54,176
Down there? Are you crazy?

628
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,387
I'm not leaving here without the stones.

629
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,682
You could get killed chasing after
your damn fortune and glory!

630
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:01,767
Maybe.

631
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:05,270
But not today.

632
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,306
Be careful.

633
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,919
Where's he going?

634
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,382
Let me go!

635
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,804
Run, Willie! Run!

636
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,274
Dr. Jones!

637
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:22,944
I keep telling you,

638
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:26,072
you listen me more, you live longer.

639
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,533
Please, let me die.

640
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:31,495
I pray to Siva,

641
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:35,332
"Let me die," but I do not.

642
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,752
Now... Now the evil of Kali take me.

643
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:41,588
How?

644
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:44,466
They will make me drink
the blood of the Kali.

645
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,886
Then I'll fall into
the Black Sleep of the Kali Ma.

646
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,346
What is that?

647
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:51,765
We become like them.

648
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,104
We'll be alive, but like a nightmare.

649
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,691
You drink blood,
you not wake up from nightmare.

650
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:17,415
You were caught trying to steal
the Sankara Stones.

651
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,585
There were five stones in the beginning.

652
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,339
Over the centuries,
they were dispersed by wars,

653
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,550
sold off by thieves like you.

654
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,510
Thieves like me, huh?

655
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,305
Still missing two.

656
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,267
A century ago,
when the British raided this temple

657
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,227
and butchered my people,

658
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:41,690
a loyal priest hid the last two stones
down here in the catacombs.

659
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,943
So that's what you've got
these slaves digging for, huh?

660
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:46,862
They're innocent children.

661
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,698
They dig for the gems
to support our cause.

662
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,827
They also search
for the last two stones.

663
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,875
Soon we will have
all the five Sankara Stones,

664
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:02,836
and the Thuggees will be all powerful.

665
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,089
What a vivid imagination.

666
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:14,222
You don't believe me?

667
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,101
You will, Dr. Jones.

668
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:24,691
You will become a true believer.

669
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,376
Hi.

670
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,110
Dr. Jones!

671
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:10,654
Don't drink, it's bad!

672
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,739
Don't drink!

673
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,240
Spit it out!

674
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,985
Dr. Jones...

675
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:11,381
You dare not do that.

676
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,609
Leave him alone, you bastards!

677
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:44,539
The British in India will be slaughtered.

678
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,875
Then we will overrun the Muslims.

679
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,711
Then the Hebrew God will fall.

680
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,465
And then the Christian God
will be cast down and forgotten.

681
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,054
Soon, Kali Ma will rule the world.

682
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,479
Dr. Jones...

683
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,751
Kali Ma protects us.

684
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,004
We are her children.

685
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,340
We pledge our devotion to her

686
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,342
with an offering of flesh...

687
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:03,219
What are you doing?

688
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,266
...and blood.

689
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:21,613
Your friend has seen,
and she has heard.

690
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,617
Now she will not talk.

691
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,753
I'm not going to have
anything nice to say

692
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,713
about this place when I get back.

693
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:42,383
Indy! For God sakes, help me!

694
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,761
What's the matter with you?

695
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,528
No, no.

696
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,061
Come.

697
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,148
Come.

698
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,548
Indiana...

699
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,553
Indiana, help us.

700
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,485
Please, snap out of it.

701
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:28,239
You're not one of them.

702
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:32,493
You're not one of them.

703
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,623
Please come back to us.

704
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,418
Don't leave me.

705
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:56,142
No!

706
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,938
What are you doing?

707
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:02,732
Are you mad?

708
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:22,019
This can't be happening,
this can't be happening.

709
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,731
Wake up, Willie, wake up.

710
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,724
No! No! No!

711
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:13,654
No, no, no!

712
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:16,699
Wake up, Dr. Jones, wake up!

713
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,705
Dr. Jones!

714
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,764
Indy, I love you.

715
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:43,935
Wake up, Indy! Wake up!

716
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:49,065
You're my best friend! Wake up, Indy!

717
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:56,322
Wait! Wait!

718
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,741
He's mine!

719
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:04,497
I'm all right, kid.

720
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,209
Mola Ram!

721
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,168
Give me some slack!

722
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,981
Willie, Willie, wake up!

723
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:40,528
Willie, Willie, it's me! I'm back!

724
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,032
Indy.

725
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,104
Indy, my friend.

726
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,149
I'm sorry, kid.

727
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:27,783
Indy, now, let's get out of here.

728
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,997
Right. All of us.

729
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,113
No!

730
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:05,756
I've got to save him!

731
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,092
- He can take care of himself.
- He needs me.

732
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:12,012
I've got to save Indy!

733
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,777
Okay, save him.

734
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:31,866
Drop him down!

735
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,159
I kill you! Drop him down!

736
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:06,984
What's the matter with him?

737
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,363
Here. Try this.

738
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:09,106
Go, Indy!

739
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:13,629
It was the Black Sleep of Kali.

740
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:28,060
Short Round!

741
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:32,356
Quit fooling around with that kid!
Get down in the cart, now!

742
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:33,941
Okeydokey, Indy!

743
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:37,361
Please listen.
To get out, you must take the left tunnel.

744
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:39,071
Thank you.

745
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,328
Shorty! Quit stalling!

746
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:30,581
Come on, Indy!

747
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:31,915
Go!

748
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,375
Go! Go!

749
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,755
Shorty, look out!

750
01:34:46,306 --> 01:34:47,598
- Come on!
- Indy!

751
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:54,813
Hurry!

752
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,029
Hurry! Hurry up!

753
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:11,038
Indy, take the left tunnel!
The left tunnel!

754
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:13,874
No, Indy! You missed it! Left tunnel!

755
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:46,573
We got company!

756
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,621
- Stop.
- Let her go!

757
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,498
- Let go of the brake.
- What?

758
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,375
- What?
- Let her go.

759
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:57,876
Our only chance is to outrun them.

760
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,061
Shorty?

761
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,146
Come up here and take the brake.

762
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:21,858
Watch it on the curves,
or we'll fly right off the track.

763
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:23,193
Okay.

764
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,693
- What are you doing?
- Short cut.

765
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,320
- Yes, Indy.
- Short, cut.

766
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,304
Watch it!

767
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:19,768
Indy, help!

768
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,189
- Hang on!
- Indy!

769
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,484
- Pull him in.
- Let me go! Let me go!

770
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:30,570
Let go of him!

771
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,949
No! No!

772
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:35,075
Pull him in!

773
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,243
- I'll catch him!
- No!

774
01:39:22,915 --> 01:39:23,540
Duck!

775
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:44,936
- All right.
- What?

776
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,605
Brakes. Brakes.

777
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:48,648
- Slow us down.
- Okay.

778
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:56,406
Big mistake. Big mistake, Indy.

779
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:57,574
Figures.

780
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:20,347
We're going too fast!

781
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,515
Too fast!

782
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:23,183
We're going to crash!

783
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,405
Water, water, water!

784
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:38,949
- Look! Look there!
- Water!

785
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:41,368
- Fire! You're on fire!
- Water, water!

786
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:44,371
- Look...
- Water, water.

787
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,332
Water, water.

788
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,126
Come on. Come on!

789
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:05,225
Let's go!

790
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:11,064
Run, run!

791
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:25,203
Willie, look out!

792
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:36,464
No!

793
01:41:36,549 --> 01:41:39,301
Head for the bridge. Go!

794
01:41:40,595 --> 01:41:42,012
Come on, Willie, this way.

795
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:56,735
Oh, God.

796
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,820
Come on, let's go. Strong bridge.

797
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:01,740
Come on, let's go. Strong bridge.

798
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:03,867
Look, strong wood.

799
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:06,036
Come on!

800
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,412
Look!

801
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:09,372
Shorty!

802
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:13,835
Help! I'm falling down.

803
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:18,048
Help!

804
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:21,051
Not very funny.

805
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:47,744
Back!

806
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:15,271
Welcome.

807
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:29,911
Let her go, Mola Ram.

808
01:43:29,995 --> 01:43:33,957
You are in a position
unsuitable to give orders.

809
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:35,667
Watch your back!

810
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:46,594
You want the stones, let 'em go.

811
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:52,600
Let her go!

812
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:56,730
Drop them, Dr. Jones.

813
01:43:56,814 --> 01:43:59,190
They will be found.

814
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:01,067
You won't.

815
01:44:04,155 --> 01:44:05,238
Indy!

816
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:06,906
Behind you!

817
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:17,667
Oh, shit.

818
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:29,929
Go on.

819
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:32,515
Go.

820
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:43,359
Go on! Go on!

821
01:44:44,445 --> 01:44:46,321
Get moving.

822
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:52,035
Shorty...

823
01:44:57,583 --> 01:45:00,168
Hang on, lady. We going for a ride.

824
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:03,797
Oh, my God!

825
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:09,093
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

826
01:45:09,553 --> 01:45:11,179
Is he nuts?

827
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:13,515
He no nuts.

828
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:15,183
He's crazy.

829
01:45:15,518 --> 01:45:20,271
Mola Ram, prepare to meet Kali

830
01:45:20,356 --> 01:45:22,106
in hell.

831
01:45:23,192 --> 01:45:24,317
What are you doing?

832
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:26,236
You fool!

833
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:28,172
Indy, cover your heart!

834
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:30,216
Cover your heart!

835
01:46:30,843 --> 01:46:32,552
Oh, my God!

836
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:43,813
Oh, my God.

837
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,191
- Look out!
- No!

838
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,218
No!

839
01:47:59,682 --> 01:48:01,391
Come on. Let's go!

840
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:04,310
The stones are mine!

841
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:07,355
You've betrayed Siva.

842
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:13,194
You betrayed Siva.

843
01:48:22,579 --> 01:48:23,997
You betrayed Siva!

844
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:58,114
Well, it's about time.

845
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,800
Hold your fire.

846
01:51:20,382 --> 01:51:22,592
We know you are coming back

847
01:51:22,926 --> 01:51:25,761
when life return to our village.

848
01:51:29,766 --> 01:51:36,272
Now you can see the magic
of the rock you bring back.

849
01:51:36,565 --> 01:51:40,359
Yes, I understand its power now.

850
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:47,617
You could've kept it.

851
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,619
What for?
They'd just put it in a museum.

852
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:52,121
It'd be another rock collecting dust.

853
01:51:52,206 --> 01:51:55,750
But then it would've given you
your fortune and glory.

854
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:57,585
Anything could happen.

855
01:51:57,669 --> 01:51:59,879
It's a long way to Delhi.

856
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:01,047
No, thanks.

857
01:52:01,131 --> 01:52:03,382
No more adventures with you,
Dr. Jones.

858
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:07,053
Sweetheart, after all the fun
we've had together?

859
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:11,224
If you think I'm going to Delhi with you,
or anyplace else

860
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:13,309
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into,

861
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:15,102
think again, buster!

862
01:52:15,187 --> 01:52:17,605
I'm going home to Missouri
where they never feed you snakes,

863
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:20,399
before ripping your heart out
and lowering you into hot pits!

864
01:52:20,484 --> 01:52:23,986
This is not my idea of a swell time!

865
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:26,948
Excuse me, sir. I need a guide to Delhi.
If you could...

866
01:52:46,843 --> 01:52:48,594
Very funny.

867
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:56,018
Very funny.
