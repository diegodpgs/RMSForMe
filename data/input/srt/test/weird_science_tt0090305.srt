00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:29,827
This is so beautiful.

2
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:31,866
You know it, Gary.

3
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:36,304
Look at her.

4
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:47,014
Do you know
what I'd like to do?

5
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,016
Shower with them.

6
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:51,819
Then we hit
the city, baby,

7
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,320
dead on,

8
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,253
for a little drinks,

9
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,849
a little nightlife,
dancing...

10
00:00:57,926 --> 00:00:59,154
Dancing.

11
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:03,665
<i>We throw a huge party,
I mean huge party...</i>

12
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:06,416
Everybody's invited,
women everywhere.

13
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,101
All these girls,
they're all there.

14
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:11,537
Naked bodies everywhere.

15
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:12,699
Gary.

16
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:14,275
They'll know my name.

17
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:15,741
What?

18
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:18,075
Nobody likes us.
Nobody.

19
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:21,582
Why are you messing
with the fantasy?

20
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,244
We know about
the reality.

21
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,753
Don't ruin
the fantasy, okay?

22
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:28,255
And then,

23
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:30,257
we're a hit, man.

24
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:32,259
We're popular.
We're revered.

25
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:34,318
Man, we're studs.

26
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:39,793

right...

27
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:43,566
those two dames

00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,572

completely,

00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:49,838
and totally in love
with us, Wyatt.

Cincinnati.

would marry Chloe?

Chet's coming home from
college for the weekend.

He's in charge.

Chet? Shit!

81
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,987
You should have
told me this

82
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,996
before I agreed
to sleep over.

83
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,965
How do you
put up with him?

84
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:29,470
If I don't, he beats the shit out of me.

85
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:33,667
It's a habit he picked
up in military school.

86
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,209
He's very
protective of me.

105
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,654
<i>the brain

106

00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,630

<i>In 15 minutes,

Making a girl.

112
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,572
Actually making a girl...

113
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:51,985
just like Frankenstein,

114
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,544

00:05:58,527 --> 00:05:59,960
<i>Sorry, Doctor.</i>

118
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:01,928
You're serious.

119
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:03,328
Yes.

120
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,968
Look me in the eyes.

121
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,971
Do I look serious?

122
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,470
<i>You're crazy.!</i>

123
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,007
<i>Crazy am I?</i>

124
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:14,473
<i>We'll see</i>

125
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,977
<i>whether I'm crazy or not.</i>

126
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:20,310
Gary Wallace,
that's absolutely gross.

127
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:23,374
I'm not digging up
dead girls.

128
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,157
I'm not talking about
digging up a dead girl.

129
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:33,126
I'm talking about
your computer, idiot.

130
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:36,687
You can simulate stuff
on your computer.

131
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:39,632
Why can't we
simulate a girl?

132
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:42,670
I guess I could,
but why?

133
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,672
It's two-dimensional
on the screen.

134
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,300
It's not
flesh and blood.

135
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,345
But we can
ask it questions.

136
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:55,281
We'll put it in
real-life sexual situations

137
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,682
and see how it reacts.

138
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:01,518
Well, what about
your girl in Canada?

139
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,285
She lives in Canada.

140
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:05,292
She has no morals.

141
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,295
I don't like that
in a girl.

142
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:10,194
Anyway, get to work.

143
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:17,104
Very nice.

144
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:25,372
Hold it, Wyatt.
I know female stats.

145
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,880
Anything bigger
than a handful,

146
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,383
you're risking
a sprained tongue.

147
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:31,942
Yeah.
Yeah.

148
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:35,983
Perfect.

149
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:37,991
Okay. Now what?

150
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,358
Should we give her
a brain?

151
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,592
Yeah. We'll play chess
with her.

152
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,692
Chess? Just give her
a brain.

153
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:59,044
That's all we can do
with my stuff.

154
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:03,107
Did you get a free
toaster with this, too?

155
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:07,120
The problem is,
this is a lame idea.

156
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:09,622
Your computer
is a wimp.

157
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,626
We need
a lot more power.

158
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:14,685
What do you suggest?

159
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:13,118
We're in.

160
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:15,122
We're in trouble, Gary.

161
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,624
This is highly illegal.

162
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:20,684
We got to fill this thing with data.

163
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:23,697
We'll make her
as real as possible.

164
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:26,029
I want her
to live, breathe.

165
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,592
I want her
to aerobicize.

166
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,540

00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,444
Party's over.

335
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:50,450
Party's over,
says the girl.

336
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,577
Here's money for you...

337
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:55,588
$50 for you,
$50 for you.

338
00:20:55,656 --> 00:21:00,525
I'll bet $5 that boy won't
make it through the club.

339
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:04,997
Woo, baby

340
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,556
You know I love you

341
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:13,496
I really shouldn't
be driving.

342
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,541
Listen,
I appreciate it.

343
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,043
I don't feel
like driving.

344
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:20,046
Okay, forget it.

345
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:21,547
I'll drive.

346
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,549
Give me the keys!

347
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,051
Will he
be all right?

348
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,954
I warned him about
that blind dog bourbon.

349
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:32,458
He don't have
a license.

350
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:36,087
I don't even have
a learner's permit.

351
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:38,961
Hey, let's scout
another party, man.

352
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:42,035
What will you
tell Chet about me?

353
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,570
Nothing.

354
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,070
Nothing?

355
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:47,607
That's not very
realistic, Wyatt.

356
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,644
I'm just trying to
concentrate on the road.

357
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,145
Concentrate harder.

358
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:55,774
You're running
a red light.

359
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,374
Oh, shit!

360
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:08,923
I hate that stuff!
I never listen to it!

361
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:11,157
I hate this car!

362
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:13,166
Are you okay?

363
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:16,668
My nuts
are halfway up my ass.

364
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,466
Other than that,
I'm perfect.

365
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:23,009
Think of what
you'll do about Chet.

366
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:25,477
He's one serious idiot.

367
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,575
You're stewed, butt-wad!

368
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:30,749
Who, me?

369
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:32,752
Know what time it is?

370
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,118
Uh, 2:00?

371
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,680
Time to pay the fiddler.

372
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:46,264
I was kind of
counting on you

373
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:48,835
to be human about this.

374
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,308
Here's the
bottom line, Wyatt.

375
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:59,244
I'm telling Mom and Dad
everything.

376
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:03,511
And I'm even considering
making up some shit.

377
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:09,255
All right, Chet.
Name your price.

378
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:11,757
$175 and zero cents,
cash...

379
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:14,259
New bills,
crisp and clean,

380
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,819
in my wallet by 7 A.M.

381
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,732
Thank you.

382
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,258
Hey, what are
big brothers for?

383
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:25,464
See you upstairs.

384
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,808
How to be jilted.

385
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,778
Pllllttt.

386
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,781
Shh.

387
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,283
The boozehounds return.

388
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:40,786
What a joke!

389
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,344
Hi, girls.

390
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:56,067
<i>Feeling kind of queasy?</i>

391
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:01,699
How about a nice
greasy pork sandwich

392
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,778
served in
a dirty ashtray?

393
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:18,257
He pukes, you die.

394
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:21,488
He's not laughing
at you, Chet.

395
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:23,621
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

396
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:28,259
Did you tell Chet about
the woman we made tonight?

397
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:29,700
He's drunk.

398
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,964
No shit.

399
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:33,369
No shit, Chet.

400
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:36,966
You donkey dicks couldn't
get laid in a morgue.

401
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:39,011
You're absolutely right.

402
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,013
You're absolutely
right, Chet.

403
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:42,514
Hey, Gary.

404
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,141
What?

405
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,953
Ha ha ha ha!

406
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:56,997
He's an asshole.

407
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,861
Look at his haircut.

408
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:02,561
Anybody with
a haircut like that

409
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,570
<i>is an asshole.</i>

410
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:22,813
Psst. Lisa.

411
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:27,987
Where are you?

412
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:31,464
I'm right behind you.

413
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:37,300
Surprise!

414
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,445
I won't hurt you.

415
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:50,449
Your lips feel like
rigor mortis has set in.

416
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:52,451
Relax a little bit.

417
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,955
I wasn't expecting you
to kiss me.

418
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:58,389
I mean, I was just...

419
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,051
I was... uh...

420
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:07,431
<i>Oh</i>

421
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:13,128
That was better.

422
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,970
Want to try it again?

423
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:18,010
If you don't mind.

424
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:21,241
I mean,
yes, please, ma'am.

425
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,078
<i>Oh oh oh oh</i>

426
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:31,387
<i>Oh</i>

427
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,085
Mmph!

428
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,791
You sure
you're only 15?

429
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:44,394
I'll be 16 in June.

430
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,040
You made me.

431
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,076
You control me.

432
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,982
What are you
thinking about, huh?

433
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,712
Um...

434
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,544
women's gymnastics.

435
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:05,991
Well, I don't know.

436
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,993
I'll do my best.

437
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:09,551
Good.

438
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:44,091
Oh.

439
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,727
Wyatt, Wyatt,

440
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,498
Wyatt, where are you?

441
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:53,540
I'm right here, Gary.

442
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:55,040
What happened?

443
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,973
I don't know.

444
00:27:57,044 --> 00:28:00,480
I think
it was a dream.

445
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:02,242
What?

446
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:04,250
Everything...
Last night, Lisa.

447
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:06,980
It had to be a dream.

448
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:09,318
<i>We were both in it.</i>

449
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:13,257
Two people can't have
the same dream.

450
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:16,160
It had to be a dream.

451
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,027
<i>In your dream,</i>

452
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:23,001
did I get up in the middle of the night

453
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,630
<i>and yak
in your sink?</i>

454
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,673
<i>Didn't throw up. No.</i>

455
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:31,177
Maybe it was a dream,
you know...

456
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:33,179
A very weird, bizarre,

457
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:40,119
<i>vivid, erotic, wet,
detailed dream.</i>

458
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:43,281
Maybe we have malaria.

459
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:44,756
Shit.

460
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,925
Gary! Wyatt!

461
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:56,492
<i>Breakfast.!</i>

462
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,137
I don't
have the bucks

463
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:05,542
to pay Chet off
about this.

464
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:08,513
You can't fear Chet
the rest of your life.

465
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:11,107
Why not?
Please...

466
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:13,516
I don't know, Wyatt.

467
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:18,149
I mean, it's seriously
affecting your sex life.

468
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,160
<i>10 seconds into
my gymnastics routine,</i>

469
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:23,162
<i>you passed out.</i>

470
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,629
You slept.

471
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:26,222
I did my toes.

472
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,133
By the way,
you're very cute.

473
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,693
We'll try it again
sometime.

474
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:37,267
Good morning,
turd brain.

475
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:38,811
Hi, Chet.

476
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,241
You spit in this?

477
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:48,311
Not that
I'm aware of, no.

478
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:51,255
Hey, that looks
pretty good.

479
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:59,721
Now make yourself one,
dick weed.

480
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:08,707
I like your panties.

481
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,208
[Burp]

482
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:12,370
It's a joke, Chet.

483
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:14,209
That's not a joke!

484
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:17,216
That is a severe
behavioral disorder.

485
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,047
Those are women's
underpants!

486
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,215
Next you'll be wearing
a bra on your head.

487
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,226
The old man's
going to have a stroke.

488
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,728
All right, Chet.
How much?

489
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:31,195
How much?

490
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:34,756
This goes way beyond
payment, pal.

491
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:36,768
Come on, Chet.
Please?

492
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:39,761
Well...

493
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:44,743
your VCR
should cover it...

494
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:46,244
for openers.

495
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:47,746
Thank you.

496
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:51,807
For Christ's sakes,
will you cover yourself?

497
00:31:11,772 --> 00:31:16,709
You guys looking for
something for your mom?

498
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:20,713
I really don't
think so... Sue.

499
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:25,150
Do you guys have,
uh... girlfriends?

at the homecoming
game, right?

508
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:51,444
Do you think
you could wrap up

509
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:54,742
a bottle of
this scent for me?

510
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:56,146
<i>Um, two.</i>

511
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:59,379
Set yourself up
with one, too.

512
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:01,978
Three scents, please.

513
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:05,889
If you were
a 15-year-old boy,

514
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:08,393
would these
turn you on?

515
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:11,920
I think so, too.
I'll take them.

516
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:22,408
Do you have a bra
to match that...

517
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:25,411
something leather,
rubber, or barbed wire?

518
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,470
Give me a break.

519
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:31,917
Check it out.

520
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:33,316

521
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,424
Five bucks?

will you do?

524

For the first time
in my life,

525
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:55,975
I don't feel like
a total dick.

526
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,771
Yeah, me either.

Momentary loss

<i>You guys getting
tired of this?</i>

534

We're not impressed.

Can I have some
of that, please?

536
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:37,416
Their shit bores me.

537
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:39,042
Should we dump them?

538
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,054
We've been with them
three months.

539
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:45,057
We've been
to all the parties.

540
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:48,060
We won't go
to any more parties.

541
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:51,063
We'll go into
a social coma.

542
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:52,530
Sorry.
Sorry.

543
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,067
Let's give them
another chance.

544
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:57,069
Okay.

545
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:58,968
Will you
forgive us?

546
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:00,972
Oh, you guys.

547
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:04,043
What will
we do with you?

548
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:39,038

There's a party tonight

What's there
to understand?

582
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:54,680
They're oppressive,
meddlesome,

583
00:36:54,748 --> 00:36:57,182
difficult, demanding,
and totally bizarre.

584
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,115
They're normal parents.

Why do you do things
I don't want?

588
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:09,627
You and Gary want friends,

589
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:11,596
you want popularity,

590
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:14,599
you want
all that stuff, right?

I was thinking
the same thing.

What do you do
for a living, Al?

611

Party.

626
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:56,761

to redefine their terms.

832
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,208
And you're completely
loyal to them?

833
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:15,583
I do whatever they say.

834
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:27,888
Hi.

835
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:34,529
Could you excuse us
for a minute, please?

836
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:38,065
No problem.
We'll be in here.

837
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,609
Okay, fine.

838
00:49:52,124 --> 00:49:54,058
They're stoked
for us.

839
00:49:54,126 --> 00:49:56,560
Should we go for it?

840
00:49:56,629 --> 00:49:58,494
What about Lisa?

841
00:49:58,564 --> 00:50:00,532
She said we should party.

842
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,329
Let's score points
with these two.

843
00:50:03,402 --> 00:50:06,269
We'll deal with
the mechanics later.

844
00:50:06,372 --> 00:50:07,566
Sounds good.

845
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:10,073
Let's not hurt
Lisa's feelings.

846
00:50:10,142 --> 00:50:11,973
She wants
a bone job from me.

847
00:50:12,044 --> 00:50:14,877
Ready to party?
Let's break!

848
00:50:26,258 --> 00:50:30,194
Those guys are weird,
but they're kinda cute.

849
00:50:30,262 --> 00:50:31,661
Hi.

850
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,665
Where did you two
disappear to?

851
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:38,464
We were in the bathroom.
We were in the kitchen.

852
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:40,471
Eating.
Doing our hair.

853
00:50:40,573 --> 00:50:43,508
Have you met
Gary and Wyatt?

854
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:45,009
Yes.
No.

855
00:50:45,077 --> 00:50:46,476
Sort of.

856
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:51,849
If you get the chance,
shower with them.

857
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:53,350
I did.

858
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:55,887
It's a mind scrambler!

859
00:50:55,955 --> 00:50:58,788
Oh, hurts so good.

860
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,287
She took a shower
with them.

861
00:51:06,365 --> 00:51:09,300
I have a wonderful
idea, Henry.

862
00:51:09,368 --> 00:51:13,202
After dinner, let's
stop by and visit Wyatt.

863
00:51:13,272 --> 00:51:15,740
He's alone
at home tonight.

864
00:51:15,808 --> 00:51:18,743
Doesn't he have
anything to read?

865
00:51:18,811 --> 00:51:20,745
I don't know, dear,

866
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:24,749
but nothing's more
important to a teenage boy

867
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:26,682
than his grandparents.

868
00:51:26,752 --> 00:51:28,583
We'll drop by.

869
00:51:35,127 --> 00:51:38,119
Ha ha ha!
Yeah! Woo!

870
00:51:42,968 --> 00:51:48,167
I'd like to apologize
for the Ice today at the mall.

871
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:51,209
It was very immature.
I'm sorry.

872
00:51:51,277 --> 00:51:54,371
It was just,
like, tomfoolery.

873
00:51:54,446 --> 00:51:56,710
<i>We are sorry.</i>

874
00:51:56,782 --> 00:51:58,841
It happened.

875
00:51:58,918 --> 00:52:01,216
What's the deal
with Lisa?

876
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:02,914
Can we borrow her?

877
00:52:02,988 --> 00:52:05,422
We can't do that, guys.

878
00:52:05,491 --> 00:52:07,425
Common decency
prohibits us.

879
00:52:07,493 --> 00:52:09,757
We can't.
It's not cool.

880
00:52:09,828 --> 00:52:12,729
Well, she said
it was cool.

881
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:16,256
We can't take advantage
of her loyalties.

882
00:52:16,302 --> 00:52:18,497
That's really
selfish.

883
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,538
Just forget it, guys.

884
00:52:20,572 --> 00:52:23,132
We can't do it,
you know?

885
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:25,767
Come on.

886

<i>Regardless of what
she may have told you,</i>

888
00:52:31,784 --> 00:52:35,242
our feelings for Lisa
run very deep.

889
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:38,222
So do ours
for Deb and Hilly.

890
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:41,726
It's respect, the time
you spent together.

891
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:43,853
You guys deserve them.

<i>We want to make
a deal with you.</i>

893

a crack at Lisa

894

are yours.

895
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:56,364

keep a secret?

896
00:52:56,475 --> 00:52:57,601
Sure.

897
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,972

898

00:59:29,368 --> 00:59:31,268
They're
better than fine.

998
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:33,702
They're not aging
anymore.

There are motorcycles

There are killer mutants

01:02:26,845 --> 01:02:30,008
Screw the house.
Screw the house.

Ha ha ha ha!

Guys, you have
uninvited guests.

1035
01:03:11,056 --> 01:03:12,990
Ask them to leave.

1036

They're getting
pretty rowdy.

Ha ha ha ha!

1038
01:03:21,166 --> 01:03:23,157
This is
an excellent chance

for you to prove your
bravery and courage.

1040

Those are outdated concepts.

Don't let John Wayne
hear you say that.

The man is dead!

Gary, do you feel
like a chicken?

1047
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:53,053
If I could shoot an
egg out my ass, I would.

1048
01:03:53,131 --> 01:03:57,568
Will all these people
think we're cowards?

Is this your party?

1059
01:04:40,745 --> 01:04:42,679
Uh... well, kind of.

1060
01:04:42,747 --> 01:04:47,343
I don't know if
you can call it a party.

1061
01:04:47,419 --> 01:04:50,320
It's, um,
just a few friends.

1062
01:04:50,388 --> 01:04:56,691
How come two unpopular dicks like you

<i>I don't know.</i>

I don't know.

1067
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:11,208
How would you like
all your friends here

1068
01:05:11,276 --> 01:05:16,213
to know that you wear
a bra on your heads?

You can
leave in peace...

1111
01:07:36,821 --> 01:07:39,813
or you can stay and die.

1112
01:07:41,693 --> 01:07:42,955
Ugh!

1113
01:07:51,169 --> 01:07:53,160

Can we keep this

God bless you.

1122

I can't believe it.

We're heroes.

Where did you
get that thing?

You really weren't
afraid of those guys?

1137

I was scared.

1138
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:10,106
But what could I do?

1139
01:10:17,648 --> 01:10:21,084
I probably shouldn't
ask too many questions

can I ask you
something strange?

1144
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:38,628
Would you kiss me?

01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:42,468
What about Ian?

Where do you want it?

1149
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:03,621
Can I ask you
a question?

1150
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:05,093
Yeah.

it's definitely a
different kind of love.

You know,

But she's
so beautiful.

Yeah, she's
really beautiful.

01:11:43,968 --> 01:11:45,560
So...

1163
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:51,599
I mean, what would I be compared to her?

1164
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:58,114
Deb, Lisa is everything
I ever wanted in a girl...

1165
01:11:59,617 --> 01:12:02,552
before I knew
what I wanted.

1166
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:06,556
<i>I know that if
I could do it again,</i>

1167
01:12:06,624 --> 01:12:09,616
I'd make her
just like you.

1168
01:12:11,429 --> 01:12:13,090
Honest.

1169
01:12:21,639 --> 01:12:23,072
Dead honest.

1170
01:12:23,141 --> 01:12:27,100
I'm like... I'm really honest
when I say that.

1171
01:12:27,211 --> 01:12:28,508
I'm so very honest.

1172
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:30,570
<i>I mean that.</i>

1173
01:13:20,998 --> 01:13:23,592
What the hell?

1174
01:13:23,668 --> 01:13:25,397
<i>Ucch.!</i>

1175
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:27,460
That little bastard.

1176
01:13:29,674 --> 01:13:33,337
If my room's okay,
I won't kill him.

1177
01:13:33,411 --> 01:13:36,869
I'll just hurt him
real bad.

1178
01:14:06,444 --> 01:14:07,911
Freeze.

1179
01:14:09,213 --> 01:14:10,646
Chet!

1180
01:14:10,715 --> 01:14:12,683
Where's my brother?

1181
01:14:13,684 --> 01:14:15,879
Ow.

1182
01:14:15,953 --> 01:14:17,386
Uh...

1183
01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:19,685
I don't know.

1184
01:14:19,757 --> 01:14:21,748
You're dead meat,
pilgrim.

1185
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:25,328
Uh...

1186
01:14:25,396 --> 01:14:27,956
Chet, Chet,
that's her nose.

1187
01:14:28,032 --> 01:14:31,229
She has nothing
to do with it.

1188
01:14:31,302 --> 01:14:33,031
Okay. You die.

1189
01:14:33,137 --> 01:14:37,471
She walks out of here
with a severe limp.

1190
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:47,140
I'll be back.

1191
01:14:52,256 --> 01:14:54,588
That's Wyatt's
older brother, Chet.

1192
01:14:54,659 --> 01:14:56,490
He's an asshole.

1193
01:14:59,263 --> 01:15:00,992
Oh, hi, Chet.

1194
01:15:01,065 --> 01:15:04,501
What the hell's
going on around here?

1195
01:15:04,568 --> 01:15:07,002
Chet, it was
an accident.

1196
01:15:07,071 --> 01:15:08,538
An accident?

1197
01:15:08,572 --> 01:15:12,440
Do you realize
it's snowing in my room,

1198
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:13,909
goddamn it?

1199
01:15:13,978 --> 01:15:16,538
<i>Some weird shit
happened, Chet.</i>

1200
01:15:16,614 --> 01:15:20,550
It doesn't take a genius
to figure that out,

1201
01:15:20,618 --> 01:15:22,051
monkey dick.

1202
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:23,552
Start talking.

1203
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:27,717
Gary and I made a
woman with the computer.

1204
01:15:27,792 --> 01:15:31,626
She went crazy and
messed up the house.

1205
01:15:31,696 --> 01:15:34,597
Don't smart-mouth me,
you shit!

1206
01:15:34,665 --> 01:15:36,462
Leave him alone.

1207
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:38,728
This is a family
matter, bimbo.

1208
01:15:38,803 --> 01:15:41,465
Chet, just let me
find Lisa.

1209
01:15:41,572 --> 01:15:43,472
She'll clear
everything up.

1210
01:15:43,574 --> 01:15:46,270
You can have
my college money

1211
01:15:46,344 --> 01:15:50,576
and my social security,
Chet.

1212
01:15:54,852 --> 01:15:59,516
So you guys think
you can fool me, huh?

1213
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,182
Huh?

1214
01:16:01,258 --> 01:16:05,024
You've synched everybody
to the same bullshit story.

1215
01:16:05,096 --> 01:16:08,588
This is
a Pershing missile, Chip.

1216
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,691
My name is Chet.

1217
01:16:10,768 --> 01:16:17,037
And I didn't think
it was a whale's dick, honey.

1218
01:16:17,108 --> 01:16:18,837
[Burp]

1219
01:16:21,212 --> 01:16:23,180
Hi, Nanny.
Hi, Grampy.

1220
01:16:25,282 --> 01:16:27,546
I'm not a moron.

1221
01:16:27,618 --> 01:16:29,051
I...

1222
01:16:31,055 --> 01:16:33,046
Was that
my grandparents?

1223
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:40,163
Are they dead?

1224
01:16:40,231 --> 01:16:42,426
No. They're
just resting.

1225
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,469
What are they
doing in here?

1226
01:16:45,503 --> 01:16:47,971
<i>I put them in there.</i>

1227
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:53,101
<i>They weren't having a very
good time at the party.</i>

1228
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:57,146
<i>Do you think
they're having a good time</i>

1229
01:16:57,214 --> 01:16:59,739
catatonic in a closet?

1230
01:17:02,086 --> 01:17:06,386
Do you have any idea
how disrespectful that is?

1231
01:17:06,457 --> 01:17:09,654
I wouldn't give
a squirt of piss

1232
01:17:09,727 --> 01:17:12,195
for your ass right now.

1233
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,760
<i>You guys
get the girls home.</i>

1234
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:21,929
<i>Wyatt,
take the Porsche.</i>

1235
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:24,132
Gary, take the Ferrari.

1236
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:25,572
The Ferrari?

1237
01:17:25,643 --> 01:17:28,669
I want to be alone
with Chet.

1238
01:17:28,746 --> 01:17:30,611
Good to see you.

1239
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:32,615
Get out of here!

1240
01:17:32,683 --> 01:17:35,174
Take your little
hussies home!

1241
01:17:37,188 --> 01:17:41,522
I want to get to
the bottom of this,

1242
01:17:41,592 --> 01:17:43,287
A.S.A.F.P.

1243
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,521
Oh, so do I.

1244
01:17:47,665 --> 01:17:51,328
First, I'd like to
butter your muffin.

1245
01:17:51,402 --> 01:17:53,495
Why must you be
such a wanker?

1246
01:17:53,571 --> 01:17:57,098
Because
I get off on it.

1247
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:59,938
I want you to
keep your big mouth shut

1248
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:02,672
about everything
that's happened here.

1249
01:18:02,746 --> 01:18:06,477
Treat Wyatt and Gary
with dignity and respect.

1250
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:08,381
Oh, really?

1251
01:18:08,452 --> 01:18:10,147
Yeah. Really.

1252
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:13,657
I can be
a real serious bitch...

1253
01:18:13,724 --> 01:18:17,854
if I don't get
what I want.

1254
01:18:17,928 --> 01:18:22,729
Ooh. Hit me
with your best shot.

1255
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:29,570
How fast
are you going?

1256
01:18:29,673 --> 01:18:31,140
About 35.

1257
01:18:36,914 --> 01:18:39,883
[Siren]

1258
01:18:42,152 --> 01:18:44,552
Wait.
This can't be right.

1259
01:18:44,622 --> 01:18:46,920
<i>Are you looking
at the RPMs?</i>

1260
01:18:46,991 --> 01:18:50,154
No. I'm looking at
about 50 tickets.

1261
01:19:05,342 --> 01:19:06,809
Bye!

1262
01:19:36,974 --> 01:19:39,442
This happens
every time!

1263
01:19:39,543 --> 01:19:41,738
Oh, my. Whew!

1264
01:19:41,812 --> 01:19:43,780
That was great!

1265
01:19:53,157 --> 01:19:55,751
You son of a bitch!

1266
01:19:55,826 --> 01:19:58,852
Al, Al!
Al, that was Gary!

1267
01:19:58,929 --> 01:20:01,295
Who is this
Gary character?

1268
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:06,929
I had a great time
last night.

1269
01:20:07,037 --> 01:20:12,771
I'll probably be grounded
for a month or so, but...

1270
01:20:12,843 --> 01:20:14,811
I'll wait for you.

1271
01:20:18,015 --> 01:20:27,856
<i>Oh</i>

1272
01:20:30,394 --> 01:20:32,760
Mmph!

1273
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,263
Mmm.

1274
01:20:34,331 --> 01:20:42,830
<i>Whoa</i>

1275
01:20:48,379 --> 01:20:50,711
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1276
01:20:50,781 --> 01:20:52,112
Hilly!

1277
01:20:52,983 --> 01:20:54,951
I love you!

1278
01:21:01,792 --> 01:21:03,453
All right!

1279
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:11,367
I want to thank you
for a great night.

1280
01:21:11,468 --> 01:21:12,867
Same here.

1281
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:17,031
I have kind of
a confession to make.

1282
01:21:20,577 --> 01:21:23,137
I'm really
not this cool.

1283
01:21:24,915 --> 01:21:27,008
That's not my car.

1284
01:21:27,084 --> 01:21:29,450
This is not my suit.

1285
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,148
Those people
weren't my friends.

1286
01:21:32,222 --> 01:21:35,658
Why are you telling me
all of this?

1287
01:21:35,726 --> 01:21:38,854
Because I want you
to like me

1288
01:21:38,929 --> 01:21:40,396
for what I am.

1289
01:21:40,464 --> 01:21:43,456
Whatever you are,
I like it.

1290
01:22:01,485 --> 01:22:02,918
Whew!

1291
01:22:02,986 --> 01:22:05,921
Well, I'd better
get going.

1292
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:10,358
Wyatt and I still
have to deal with Chet.

1293
01:22:10,994 --> 01:22:12,393
Quit screwing around!

1294
01:22:12,463 --> 01:22:15,626
This isn't funny,
you stupid bitch!

1295
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:18,759
Careful, Chet.
Don't make me angry.

1296
01:22:18,869 --> 01:22:20,461
Sorry.

1297
01:22:23,507 --> 01:22:25,407
That's better.

1298
01:22:25,476 --> 01:22:27,944
Turn me back
to normal.

1299
01:22:28,011 --> 01:22:30,878
I haven't done
anything to you.

1300
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:33,883
You've done plenty
to your brother.

1301
01:22:33,951 --> 01:22:35,316
Like what?

1302
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:37,876
You've nagged him,
harassed him...

1303
01:22:37,955 --> 01:22:39,388
Huh, me?

1304
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:43,950
Supressed him,
extorted money from him.

1305
01:22:44,027 --> 01:22:46,086
It was done
out of love.

1306
01:22:46,163 --> 01:22:50,065
I should give you
a set of elephant balls.

1307
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:52,260
Heeagghh!

1308
01:22:54,471 --> 01:22:58,908
Promise me you'll leave
Wyatt and Gary alone,

1309
01:22:58,976 --> 01:23:02,070
and I'll change you back.

1310
01:23:02,179 --> 01:23:04,010
Oh, all right.

1311
01:23:04,081 --> 01:23:06,072
Shake on it, huh?

1312
01:23:09,086 --> 01:23:12,522
No, thanks.
I'd rather not.

1313
01:23:12,589 --> 01:23:14,614
Wait!
Where are you going?

1314
01:23:14,691 --> 01:23:17,819
I have to
go and get changed.

1315
01:23:17,895 --> 01:23:19,089
What about me?

1316
01:23:19,163 --> 01:23:23,065
The effect
will wear off, okay?

1317
01:23:35,212 --> 01:23:36,679
Well?

1318
01:23:38,048 --> 01:23:39,982
I'm in love.

1319
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:41,483
Isn't it great?

1320
01:23:41,552 --> 01:23:42,849
The best.

1321
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,649
I'll tell you what.

1322
01:23:44,721 --> 01:23:47,622
Things are
