1
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,508
Hello again, everybody,
I'm Jim Lampley.

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,708
Certain athletes are born enemies:

3
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,147
Bird and Magic. Ali and Frazier.

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,029
Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding.

5
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,309
But the fiercest rivalry was between
two fighters from Pittsburgh...

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,622
...with the names Razor and Kid.

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,346
The fight of the year!
Both men exhausted.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,229
<i>1982, Pittsburgh.</i>

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,589
<i>Razor and Kid, both undefeated
top-ranked contenders...</i>

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,981
<i>...divide the city in
a spectacular war.</i>

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,063
Now Kid's smelling
blood, punishing Razor...

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,551
...with a relentless fury.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,987
And down goes Razor.
Down goes Razor.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,346
Down goes Razor.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,990
<i>The brutal 15-round bout...</i>

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,423
<i>...is still considered one of
the greatest fights of the '80s.</i>

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,828
<i>Kid and Razor quickly rose
to superstardom.</i>

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,742
<i>And the man behind their meteoric ascent
was the late fight impresario, Dante Slate.</i>

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,750
My dad was king of the ring
and bringer of the bling.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,581
And that makes me royalty,
blessed with all his powers.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,068
Really good, Dante, but don't
look into the camera. Just look at me.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,905
I don't know. It's better when
I'm connecting with people.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,267
- Yeah, I don't think...
- What's up, people?

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,263
<i>As the world
clamored for a rematch...</i>

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,867
<i>...Slate knew that ratings would turn
to dollar signs for both fighters.</i>

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,626
What a turn of events!
Unbelievable!

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,782
<i>The rematch drew
the biggest audience...</i>

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,261
<i>...since the Thrilla in Manila
nine years earlier.</i>

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,021
Kid goes down!

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,143
<i>But this time,
the story was different.</i>

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,430
<i>Razor soundly defeated Kid in a lopsided
victory that was over in four rounds.</i>

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,471
<i>What lay ahead was the grudge match that
would've brought each fighter millions.</i>

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,147
<i>Then came an announcement
that shocked the world.</i>

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,985
Today, I'm announcing my retirement
from professional boxing.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,226
The man's a coward.
I'm gonna get my rematch.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,906
You hear me, Razor?
I'm getting my ****ing rematch!

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,621
Sharp has declined to comment further
on his decision to this very day.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,351
And sadly, like many
former professional athletes...

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,623
...he lost his fortune just years
after his retirement.

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,590
<i>Razor went back to Benson
Shipbuilders in 1987...</i>

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,742
<i>...where he had worked
before he went pro.</i>

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,509
As the spotlight faded, Kid became a pitchman
for everything from Jockey to jock itch.

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,267
<i>Today, he runs a successful car dealership
and a popular restaurant in Pittsburgh.</i>

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,467
Hey!

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,700
<i>Still, one can almost
imagine him tonight...</i>

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,107
<i>...on the 30th anniversary
of the fight that never was...</i>

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,661
<i>...contemplating yet another year
of growing older...</i>

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,181
<i>...obsessed with a fight
that never happened...</i>

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,785
<i>...and never will.</i>

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,702
And just for the record,
I never had jock itch.

51
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,191
I'm just a great actor.

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,230
Hey, champ. How's it going?

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,860
Don't call me "champ."
Come on. I got your "champ."

54
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,711
Ha-ha-ha!
A little early to start drinking.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,305
You still got it!

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,344
I got nothing!

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,824
Guys. All right, yeah.

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,391
- Walter.
- Hey.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,783
- What the hell is happening?
- You didn't see yourself on TV?

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,671
I don't have a TV.
Bad for the brain.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,221
There was this thing on
about you and Kid.

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,469
Oh, who cares about that?

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,985
Man, come on, like...

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,142
Why'd you drop out? Seriously.

65
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,671
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,664
Never told anybody this...

67
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,390
...but, deep inside...

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,070
...I wanna dance.

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,421
- I wanna dance. The Bristol Stomp.
- Ha-ha-ha.

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,271
- The Ching-a-Ling. Pony.
- Stop, you really need to get a TV.

71
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,549
You don't know a good thing
when you see it.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,424
<i>- What's it like?
- It's strong, but it goes down easy.</i>

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,263
No, but seriously. Did you know that
Razor Sharp was ambidextrous?

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,746
No, I hadn't heard that.

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,109
Yeah, you can knock him out
with either hand.

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,423
Kind of like how you went down
over and over in that last fight.

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,460
- Ooh.
- Got a comedian in the house.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,231
Sir, why do you have to be so rude
to me in my own place?

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,382
Easy, Kid, that's a
lady you're talking to.

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,305
Are you sure, Joey, because this guy's
got a real set of balls on him.

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,464
Hey, asshole. It's been 30 years since
those fights. Your shit's getting boring.

82
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,147
Look, I wasn't prepared for that fight.
I was arrogant. I was overconfident.

83
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,665
I just didn't train enough.

84
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,467
Unless you call having sexual intercourse
16 times a week adequate training.

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,662
But don't worry, honey,
you would've been safe.

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,345
Ooh!

87
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,225
Aha! We got a good
audience tonight.

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,190
- Mr. Conlon, come on. Let me in, man.
No, go away!

89
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,742
Hey, what's going on?
What's the problem?

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,983
He barricaded himself in with his
scooter. Second time this week.

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,347
Second time? Sorry, Nora.

92
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,026
Lightning, it's me.
What's the problem?

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,110
That degenerate out there!
He replaced my girl, Maria!

94
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,742
Hey, don't say that. You don't even
know the guy. He looks like a nice guy.

95
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,307
No! Maria gives me the sponge bath!

96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,748
Not this guy. His hands are
like 80 grit sandpaper.

97
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,023
And he's throwing himself into it
too much, if you know what I mean.

98
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,020
Christ, I've never been so clean
in my entire life.

99
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,864
- Hey, I'm just doing my job.
- I know.

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,182
Yeah, that's what my
scoutmaster said.

101
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,471
Mr. Sharp, we've
had this conversation before.

102
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,181
I appreciate it, but he's just going
through a bad time. He'll get over it.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,542
He's gonna have to start looking
for another facility.

104
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,021
- Okay. No problem.
- Sorry.

105
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,388
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me back up. Wait!

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,064
What kind of man knowingly takes a job
where he's gotta wash another man's balls?

107
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,700
He's a hero as far as I'm
concerned, pal. Heh.

108
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,544
You watch that TV show last night?

109
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,145
Yeah, I heard.

110
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,224
- Listen, uh, your thing. Turn it down.
- What?

111
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,430
Oh, the hearing aid.
Goddamn thing drives me crazy.

112
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,789
- Feel like RZ-freaking-DZ.
- Heh.

113
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,989
Well, I'm still steamed up
over that show last night.

114
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,381
- You could've beaten that punk.
- Save your breath.

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,981
That book is closed. Why does
everybody wanna open that book?

116
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,508
Just forget about it. Let it go.
Sleeping dogs and all that.

117
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,662
They told me about the new meds.
You try them?

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,064
They say they'll add a couple of years to
your life. Maybe you'll reach, heh, 1000?

119
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,264
What difference does it make? I can't
afford them and you're not paying.

120
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,831
You done enough already.

121
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,109
Hey. No, no. It's all right. I'll
take care of it. Don't worry.

122
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,308
You're the only one
that's never screwed me over.

123
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,428
That's gotta count for something.

124
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,743
Don't change the subject. I'm still
very, very pissed off at you.

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,949
Pissed off at me? The fight was
30 years ago. You gotta let it go.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,149
Man, we had so much on the table.
Why did you walk away?

127
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,747
We could be sitting in hot tubs
now with big-ass blonds.

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,631
Heh, heh. Yeah. You can't swim.

129
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,910
You would've drowned.

130
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,143
On that note, I'll leave you
with the blonds you'll never have.

131
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,264
Tell Mr. Sandpaper Hands
I want my two sleeping pills.

132
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,422
- It's 10 in the morning.
- Then I want four.

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,789
I wanna be dreaming of all them
hookers that you deprived me of.

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,306
Hey!

135
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,503
Hey, you can't park here.

136
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,826
Take it easy, man.
I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present.

137
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,027
Really?

138
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,428
Oh, come on, Razor. Razor.

139
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,981
It's Dante Jr. Don't act like I didn't
grow up to be a fine looking man.

140
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,188
Right. Too bad your father
didn't show up...

141
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,503
...so I can belt him for taking
what was left of my purses.

142
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,052
Dad passed away last year.

143
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:53,686
If you didn't see him dead,
I wouldn't trust that.

144
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,060
I did.

145
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,664
Now you make me feel a little bad.

146
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,190
- Wanna come in or something?
- I would love to come in, Razor.

147
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,949
You look good. Hey, should I roll
my window up? Is this a good area?

148
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,587
Tuna fish, some overripe bananas
that you probably bought on sale.

149
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,901
You shop like my grandmom.

150
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,781
Bananas are a good source of potassium
and I had double coupons for the fish.

151
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,025
That's not fish. Fish is like a sushi.
That's a step above cat food, Razor.

152
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,026
It's dolphin safe and I don't sweat the
extra nickel because it's the right thing.

153
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,309
Not my business. Your house, sorry.

154
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,783
What is this?
It's like a mouse or something?

155
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,061
- What is that?
- A dog.

156
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,467
- A dog?
- It's a dog.

157
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,544
- So why you here, Junior?
- Why am I here?

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,631
You know what this is, Razor?

159
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,384
A bad movie?

160
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,224
- It's a video game.
- Right.

161
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,462
When did they unfreeze you,
Captain America?

162
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,984
"Captain America"? You know, I'd
like to take you down a peg...

163
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,302
...but it looks like
somebody beat me to it.

164
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,506
A height joke.
That was good. That's original.

165
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,469
Height ain't nothing but a number.

166
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,703
See, in Thailand, I'm in the 95th
percentile. I'm okay over there.

167
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,511
So, what you say can't hurt
my feelings. Let's talk turkey.

168
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,987
The guys that made this game
saw your HBO special.

169
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,950
They loved it. I loved it.
Did I tell you? I really did.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,068
Anyway, they wanna put
you and Kid in the game.

171
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,427
Okay? Before you say
anything, hear me out.

172
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,505
All they do is videotape you throwing a
couple punches, record you making noises.

173
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,901
Unh! Unh! Ugh! I'm gonna kill you.

174
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,506
Except in a white guy's voice.
They don't wanna scare anybody.

175
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,679
- That's how simple this is.
- It ain't that simple.

176
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,626
- I can't be in the same room as that guy.
- Okay, okay. Now listen. Slow down.

177
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,067
That's the case, I'll bring
you in on separate days.

178
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,621
You're talking less than
an hour for 10 grand.

179
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,587
Ten grand, man. Easy.

180
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,028
No. Not worth it.

181
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,950
The hell you mean, it ain't worth it?
I'm looking at your house!

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,704
No. You're obviously doing well...

183
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,864
...with all this F-you mouse
sculpture making money you got.

184
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,261
It's a dog and I don't
do it for money.

185
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,747
Tell you what, you wanna
play hardball? Twelve Gs.

186
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,062
Twelve Gs. I pulled it out my ass.
Twelve Gs.

187
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,621
I'll get 12 Gs, you
knickknack-making son of a bitch.

188
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,541
I don't like the way you
looking at me, as if...

189
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,462
Stubborn piece of shit.

190
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,146
You were right to rip him off,
Daddy. You should've.

191
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,500
Come here with a perfectly damn good deal,
you gonna throw it back in my face?

192
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,982
Like I'm crazy? Okay. That's fine.

193
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,905
Piece of shit!

194
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,747
Damn it!

195
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,504
I'll do it for 15.

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,341
But I don't wanna see him.

197
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,980
Done and done. That is done.

198
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,591
Ha, ha.

199
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,311
Hey, Raze, real quick.
Do you got any jumper cables?

200
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,664
You think you can give me a jump?

201
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,901
No.

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,746
Okay, it's fine.

203
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,066
I'll figure it out.

204
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,269
You've made the right decision.
It's gonna be great.

205
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,390
Thank you, Raze!

206
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,427
He said yes! Whoo!

207
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,385
Excuse me!

208
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,150
Come on! It's like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Just come in here and get it over with.

209
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,064
This is stupid. What is this mess?

210
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,222
"This mess" is the future.

211
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,589
Now, come on, Razor. I don't got
time to be playing with you all day.

212
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,222
You got male camel toe.

213
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,385
You look like Buzz Lightyear.

214
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,188
"To infinity and beyond!" Stop it.

215
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,263
I'm playing. Come on, man.

216
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,983
- I'm not doing this.
- What you talking about? You look great.

217
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,826
- I wish I could put you in a martini glass.
- I've never been this uncomfortable.

218
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,268
Will you relax? It's gonna take you a
few minutes. How bad could it be?

219
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,581
And fix your crotch, man.

220
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,380
- We're ready.
- We're good, Raze. Let's go.

221
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,309
- Looks good, huh?
- Money time, baby.

222
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,748
Looks good. Okay, Razor. Let's throw
some jabs at Wilbur the dummy.

223
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,741
- We're recording your punch form.
- Okay.

224
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,025
One, two. One, two.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,467
Okay. Can you put a
little oomph into it?

226
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,021
Heh. This is stupid.

227
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,545
Let's try, okay?

228
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,941
Act like the dummy is real
and the dummy's hitting back.

229
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,187
Imagine that somebody just sold you a
overpriced can of tuna. There you go.

230
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,263
Come on, Razor! Imagine it's Kid.

231
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,300
- That's good.
- Huh? Damn right, it's good.

232
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,787
Hey, I hope I don't look
like that big of an asshole.

233
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,147
- You set me up?
- Nobody set anybody up, Razor.

234
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,460
What'd I tell you?
I told you to come in 1:00.

235
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:52,310
I came early.

236
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,669
I wanted to see my old friend. He's
been ducking me 30 years. I missed him.

237
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,630
It don't look like you're missing
any meals. I'm out of here.

238
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,785
No, you're not. Not till you admit that
you quit because you were scared of me.

239
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,860
- Why do you talk like that?
- What do you mean?

240
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,108
- Just admit it. It's true.
- You know what?

241
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,228
I'm getting out of here,
and I'm asking nice.

242
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,984
- Or what?
- Just get out of the way.

243
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,464
Listen. Those punches might get these nerds
all hot under the pants, but you know what?

244
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,665
They're the same half-assed punches you
threw 30 years ago when you ran from me.

245
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,505
- Move, or I'm moving you.
- Try and move me. Go ahead.

246
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,743
You know, maybe you're right. I might
pop a disc, you're just so fat.

247
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,789
What weight class you
fighting at now, LAP-BAND?

248
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,308
- I can still take you.
- Maybe to the prom if you ask nice.

249
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,985
- Pushing your luck now.
- Hey! Hey!

250
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,181
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,184
- I'm sorry. I did it to you, all right?
- You're just sorry?

252
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,830
You're a lucky guy.

253
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,500
No, no. No! No, man!
What are you doing?

254
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,742
- No, no. Razor!
- What you doing with that?

255
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,624
- Stop! Stop it!
- Oh, man.

256
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,343
What are you doing?
Stop it. Don't do that!

257
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,501
I would have beat you!

258
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,500
You done lost your mind?

259
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,986
Come on, come on, come on.

260
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,710
Come on. Come on.

261
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,986
What are you doing?

262
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,031
Guys, this is...

263
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,864
It's not the behavior of old men!

264
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,186
Yo, guys, you gotta see this.
Come here.

265
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,100
Check this out.

266
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,349
And the number one play of the week.

267
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,310
Check out this clip of two former
Light Heavyweight Champs...

268
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,349
...that is blowing up online.

269
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,062
In fact, Razor Sharp and Kid McDonnen's
brawl has gotten so popular...

270
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,506
...it's gone animated.

271
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,781
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

272
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,749
<i>Unh! You're a lucky guy.</i>

273
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,348
You two some kind of superheroes?

274
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,430
Yeah, I'm the Green Champion
and he's the Emerald SuperPussy.

275
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,511
Yeah, must be tough for you, huh?
SuperPussy?

276
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,150
SuperPussy.

277
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,267
You can't run or hide anymore, can you?
And you can't ignore me anymore.

278
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,105
Huh? You can't ignore me.
Can't ignore me.

279
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,661
Will one of you hurry up
and rape this guy, already?

280
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,106
Yo, Sharp, McDonnen.
You made bail.

281
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,109
Soon as we get out of these cops'
eyelines, I'm gonna punch you again.

282
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,944
Tell me so I know when to say "Ow."

283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,263
Ladies! My God, please don't embarrass
yourselves any further out here.

284
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,104
Come look at this.
Look at this video.

285
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,989
- What's this?
- It's going viral.

286
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,461
It's got over,
like, a million views right now.

287
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,782
You don't know what I mean
by "going viral."

288
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,624
Razor, you know what YouTube is?

289
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,626
Neither one of you know what "viral" means?
What type of two out-of-touch, old...

290
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,861
- Hey.
- Hey.

291
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,829
Sorry. No, no. Uncalled-for.
Forget it.

292
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,382
- Look, it's a video of your fight.
- That's me? Hey, that's me.

293
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,987
- They say the camera adds 10 pounds.
- What's your excuse for the other 20?

294
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,905
Do me a favor? Save the verbal
jousting for a more important time.

295
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,744
I'm about to lay
something huge on you.

296
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,149
I got a company that wants the rematch.
December 15th, Palace Theatre.

297
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,780
- They want to pay each of us 75 grand.
- Each of us?

298
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,591
I meant each of you. They're
gonna pay you 100 grand.

299
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,711
You just said 75.
Now you went to 100?

300
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:03,288
I was thinking about
the thing at the house.

301
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,070
Don't worry, it ain't gonna happen.

302
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,666
Just give me the 15 grand
you promised for the game.

303
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,788
Hey, jagoff, you
promised him 15 grand?

304
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,146
He did. Give me the money.

305
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,671
They're not gonna pay you.

306
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,266
Lucky if they don't sue
for breaking the equip...

307
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,185
- I needed that money.
- I should be doing this for the 15.

308
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,786
You should get off me
in front of this police station.

309
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,044
I got more money for you.

310
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,526
Nothing you could offer me.
I ain't fighting.

311
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,025
You're still a chickenshit.

312
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,581
- Razor, don't walk away.
- Why don't you wanna do it?

313
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,186
- Please.
- It's a chance of a lifetime, you moron.

314
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,501
Not helping. Razor!

315
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,630
- What are you provoking him for?
- I'm not. I didn't do anything.

316
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,109
Well, I did do something,
but that's a long time ago.

317
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,702
And that's probably what it is.

318
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,664
I banged his girlfriend.

319
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,824
- I'm sorry, what?
- I knocked her up. His girlfriend.

320
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,506
Great segue into information
I needed to know earlier.

321
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,822
Probably wasn't a good idea.

322
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,141
A momentary lapse in judgment.

323
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,671
I'll say.

324
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,630
Putting your thing where it
doesn't belong. That's what you...

325
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,182
I can't... This is white
people shit, man.

326
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,791
Son of a bitch. He ain't
ever gonna fight me.

327
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,062
Can't believe you would.
It's insane.

328
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,383
Oh, yeah? What? Give me one reason.

329
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,542
You're old. You're fat.

330
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,220
You got a bad back.
You got weak knees.

331
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,381
You're fat.

332
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,225
Hey, you know, don't sugarcoat it.
Be honest.

333
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,749
Ah...

334
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,022
It ain't gonna happen anyway.

335
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,581
It's never gonna happen.

336
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,742
Thank God for that.

337
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,509
Walter, where you going?

338
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,381
More layoffs, man. After 30 years,
they let me go just like that.

339
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,587
You're kidding.

340
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,505
Hey, Razor, boss needs to see you.

341
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,828
Least you don't have a family, man.

342
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,261
Okay, Razor.

343
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,104
No, done and done.

344
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,150
Hey, hey, look, get off my phone
before you change your mind.

345
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,109
Okay, man. Bye.

346
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,944
I am done with you! That's right.
It is over, you piece of shit.

347
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,945
Hell, yeah!

348
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,631
Yo! Get back in your car!

349
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,067
Ain't my car no more, bitch! Okay?
I'm getting a new one!

350
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,463
Sorry! I just won a cracker lottery!

351
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,985
Thank you, Jesus!

352
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,670
Thirty years! Thirty goddamn years!

353
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,467
Yes! Yes! Yes!

354
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,621
Yes, yes, yes!

355
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,424
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

356
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,231
Yes! Yes!

357
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,790
Phew.

358
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,910
I gotta get in shape.

359
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,867
All right, Pittsburgh.
Who's ready to make history, huh?

360
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,021
I love it.

361
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,150
Okay, without further ado, I'd like
to reintroduce to the world...

362
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,429
...Billy "The Kid" McDonnen
and Henry "Razor" Sharp!

363
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,701
Come on, now!

364
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,100
- Thought you said there'd be a crowd.
- Trust me. Sit.

365
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,308
I want you all to
forget two things:

366
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,191
The Rumble in the Jungle,
the Thrilla in Manila.

367
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,223
But what you will never forget...

368
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,269
Grudgement Day! Questions.

369
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,344
- Uh, is this fight some kind of joke?
- No, it's not. Next question.

370
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,107
If one of you gets knocked down, is it safe to
say that you've fallen and you can't get up?

371
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,020
Okay. Does anybody
have a real question?

372
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,990
Razor, who do you think is in
better shape? You or the Kid?

373
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,063
Depends what kind of shape
you're talking about.

374
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,700
- If it's round, he is.
- Ha, ha.

375
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,228
- So who's gonna train you?
- Who's gonna train me? Frankie Brite.

376
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,427
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

377
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,067
- Isn't he training Geronimo Padilla?
- He is, but he's gonna train me too.

378
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,431
What precautions are you taking? At your age,
this really does seem dangerous, even deadly.

379
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,551
Understand something. This fight will be
cleared as if it was any other bout, okay?

380
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,778
Are either of you worried
that you won't pass?

381
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:31,889
No, I'm not worried.
I had all my shots.

382
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,590
Johnny Walker, Jack Daniel's.

383
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,664
- Jose Cuervo.
- Ha-ha-ha.

384
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,169
Dante, is there any shot
this would be the first

385
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,294
fight that features
Life Alert necklaces?

386
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,190
You're being very disrespectful.

387
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,265
A man turns 60, all of a sudden he's washed
up and you kick him out of the workplace.

388
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,106
That may have been fine 100 years ago,
when men were dying at the age of 50.

389
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,389
But in this world, it's different.
The elderly are strong.

390
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,260
Their spirit is strong.
And they have a voice.

391
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,430
And that voice is in these two
men and they will be heard.

392
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,623
Respect, bitches.

393
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,940
Get up, right now.

394
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,463
- That's the way you sell a fight.
- You bet your old grizzly ass it is.

395
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,188
Hey, Razor.

396
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,104
- Whoa, Sally Rose.
- Hey.

397
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,149
I thought I saw you. I wasn't sure.

398
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,906
- Hey.
- You look good. How you been?

399
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,107
So why you here?

400
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,469
- I came to see you.
- You did?

401
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,108
Why would you want
to do something like that?

402
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,661
To talk you out of
this crazy fight.

403
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,226
I know what you mean. It's a little crazy.
You think it's kind of a joke, right?

404
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,590
I just don't want you to get hurt.
That's all.

405
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,511
That's good.

406
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,665
Nice seeing you.

407
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,907
How many alcoholic beverages
do you consume?

408
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,023
Normal. Five, maybe six.

409
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,344
- A week?
- Well, maybe a little more than normal.

410
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,868
Ah! Oh, baby Jesus.

411
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,545
It feels normal.

412
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,710
To you, maybe.

413
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,628
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.

414
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,029
- There they are.
- Hey! Ha, ha.

415
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,342
Just like I said.
Paragons of health, huh?

416
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,144
Passed with flying colors.

417
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,545
Clean bill of health.

418
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,180
Not quite "with flying colors."

419
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,707
But it's our paintbrushes
that we painting with.

420
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,023
So look, I'm gonna introduce you
to a guy that's making this happen.

421
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,287
Lou Camare, our promoter.

422
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,692
I would've met you at
the press conference...

423
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,381
...but Junior begged me to let him go
in front of the cameras by himself.

424
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,668
This face needs solo exposure.
You know that.

425
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,061
You know, my brother's
the doctor who saw you.

426
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,063
And my other brother,
he's the commissioner.

427
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,383
I can get a dogfight sanctioned if I
needed to. This one was tricky.

428
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,781
Are you saying that I can
bring my dog here too?

429
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,183
That's not what he said. Why do I
feel like there's something coming?

430
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,820
Here's the thing. The
conference didn't go as planned.

431
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,187
We gotta sell 5000 tickets, baby.
Five thousand.

432
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,024
So I'm gonna need
help promoting it.

433
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,184
Not individuals, both of you.
Together. As a group, okay?

434
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,111
I could never spend more than
three minutes with this bum...

435
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,702
- ...unless I was beating the brains out of him.
- He's got it backwards.

436
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,749
He's punch-drunk.
I was smacking him around.

437
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,982
I smacked him from ring
post to ring post.

438
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,582
A little too much of this in
the head. Little too much.

439
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,742
- When's the fight?
- Boom.

440
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,740
Hey, listen. Bottom line is this: if we
don't sell tickets, we don't make money.

441
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,227
- No tickets, no money.
- "No tickets, no money." I'm in.

442
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,590
- That's my guy. No ticket, no money.
- No tickets, no money. No money, no fight.

443
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,430
No ticket, no money.

444
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,948
No fight, no money, no tickets. Either
way you put it, all three ways:

445
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,865
No tickets, no fight, no money.
No money, no fight, no tickets.

446
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,102
No fight, no money, no tickets.
What's the third one?

447
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,980
- All three ways.
- You got it covered.

448
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,147
What's your problem?

449
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,304
You gonna fight, fight.
You're not gonna fight, don't fight.

450
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,269
You fight,
you have to do these things.

451
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,788
The point that I'm making, in
order to do it, we gotta do it together.

452
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,942
Yeah, together. Okay.

453
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,744
<i>It's show time
at the Miroquois Casino.</i>

454
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,268
<i>Slots, entertainment and the best
buffet on the Monongahela River!</i>

455
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,581
<i>Just ask these two.</i>

456
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,823
Whoa, will you get a load
of that hunk of meat?

457
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,588
Hey, watch your mouth, Billy "The Kid"
McDonnen, onetime Light Heavyweight Champ.

458
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,989
I'm right over here. Right over
by the delicious prime rib.

459
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,986
Sorry, Henry "Razor" Sharp,
onetime Light Heavyweight Champ.

460
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,828
I didn't hear you as I am distracted
by this mouth-watering chicken breast.

461
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,665
If you got a gambling problem,
if you're a degenerate...

462
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,505
...I wouldn't come down here
because gambling is a cancer.

463
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,504
Cut! Please just follow
the script, Razor.

464
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,786
It's not that.

465
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,501
The pictures make this look glamorous
but it could be a problem for people...

466
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,469
...and I'm saying
it should be known.

467
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,464
What is this, improv night at Chuckles?
Come on, say the words.

468
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,146
Well, maybe I just happened
to hit a sore spot, huh?

469
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,144
Didn't you lose 200 grand
betting the Buffalo Bills?

470
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,481
Who loses the Super
Bowl four times in a row?

471
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:56,647
I don't know. You.

472
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,710
- I thought they'd win once.
- Maybe you got a talent for losing.

473
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,340
- I got a talent for busting your...
- Hey, hey!

474
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,946
- You're getting personal.
- I'm standing here.

475
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,023
<i>I'm gonna put that
shit right up your ass!</i>

476
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,467
Heh. No such thing as bad publicity.

477
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,271
<i>Those two ex-fighters
are making news again...</i>

478
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,701
<i>...and are trending on Twitter.
We'll have that...</i>

479
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,261
- What a lot of crap.
- What's the matter?

480
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,505
You gotta fight in 12 weeks, you're doing
stupid publicity stunts. Who's training you?

481
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,862
Well, here's a hint:
Somebody I can trust.

482
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,188
Well, that's easy,
because you don't trust nobody.

483
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,229
- I trust you.
- Ha, ha.

484
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,028
Forget it. I'm a dinosaur.

485
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,106
Come on, we did pretty good
for 13 years together.

486
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,060
In case you haven't noticed, I can hardly
take care of myself. I'm like an infant baby.

487
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,745
Except I got three
white pubic hairs.

488
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,222
Heh. You can do this.

489
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,589
I haven't got time.
I gotta find myself a place to stay.

490
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,027
You can stay with me
until I find you a new place.

491
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,990
No. Don't spend any more money
on me. I'm almost done.

492
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,904
It's like polishing a turd.

493
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,426
Do you remember the first time
I came to the gym?

494
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,904
Do you remember what you
said to me? I do.

495
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,744
I said, "it looks like the garbage man
forgot to take out the trash."

496
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,982
Heh. Yeah. Something
cheerful like that.

497
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,745
Then you said:

498
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,426
"if I take you on, kid,
you're stuck with me."

499
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,945
You said that.

500
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,546
Don't quit on me, Light.
I won't quit on you.

501
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,950
Oh, here we go.

502
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,625
Call it.

503
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,261
It's a quarter.

504
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,344
Come on. Light, I need your help.

505
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,787
It'd be fun. One last time.

506
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,626
You know why I said what
I did about the garbage?

507
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,781
No.

508
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,305
I didn't want your head to get swelled
up. You were so goddamn good.

509
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,705
Thanks, buddy.

510
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,544
- Raze?
- Hmm?

511
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,464
Give me my quarter back.

512
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,791
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

513
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,630
How can you be so cheap?

514
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,260
I haven't got any money.
Give me my damn quarter.

515
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,626
Okay. Fine.

516
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,825
Nice car.

517
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,303
Oh, wow! This is exciting. Look who's
here to meet me. Kid McDonnen.

518
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,145
You know him from the Internet.
"Two old guys fighting."

519
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,827
He used to be Light Heavyweight Champ.
Wow, you put on a couple pounds?

520
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,784
- You're gonna get me in shape.
- Oh, really?

521
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,061
He's gonna get me in shape.

522
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,148
- Give us a couple minutes.
- They can come.

523
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,984
Watch a real reality show.

524
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,461
- Watch us negotiate.
- Okay. Okay! Ha, ha.

525
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,106
Hey! Ho-ho! All right.

526
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,906
- Let's get real, Kid.
- Okay, let's get real.

527
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,789
Me training you,
it ain't happening.

528
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,831
Well, this might be a problem, because
I already made the announcement.

529
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,028
You, my friend,
are embarrassing yourself.

530
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,547
A great performer knows when
it's time to get off the stage.

531
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,785
- What? Foreman fought when he was old.
- He was 15 years younger than you.

532
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,385
Listen, you know what I'm gonna do?

533
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,067
I'll go down there and fight
any one of those fighters, the best one.

534
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,669
And then if you see that I don't
have what you want, I'll walk away.

535
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,346
It's over.

536
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,911
Where's your dignity?

537
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,269
You're in my office, begging me
for a comeback you don't deserve?

538
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,900
- Well, take your best shot now.
- Whoa, Kid.

539
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,346
What are you flexing for?

540
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,741
Don't try it. I'm warning you.
I'll lay you out.

541
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,868
- Don't worry, I won't.
- All right.

542
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,590
Oh. Come on, Kid.

543
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,550
- What?
- I saw your fist clench 10 seconds ago.

544
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,351
I saw your eyes dart at my gut
five seconds ago.

545
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,940
You're an old man.
You're washed up.

546
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,904
- Ooh!
- Did you see that five seconds ago?

547
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,506
Huh? Huh? What?
My eyes darted there first.

548
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,950
I can't believe you. After what I
did for your father, your family...

549
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,222
...how you ever could say no to me.

550
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,587
You wouldn't have all
this if it wasn't for me.

551
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,391
You wouldn't have this gym
if it weren't for me.

552
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,544
I don't understand.

553
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,180
You mention my father. That's a low blow.
I respect what you did for my family.

554
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,741
- What are you gonna do?
- Okay, I'll let you train here.

555
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,462
Good.

556
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:15,134
I'll even get some of
my guys to help you out.

557
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,706
But you and I both know
I won't be doing jack.

558
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,464
Okay. Thanks.

559
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,748
- Long as we're clear.
- Yeah, all right.

560
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,631
See? You got me moving
faster already.

561
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,424
Hey. You again?

562
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,266
- Think I can talk to you for a second?
- Why do you keep following me around?

563
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,663
My name's BJ. I'm your son, Kid.

564
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,389
We should get some coffee.

565
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,391
Yeah, I'd like that.

566
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,546
Excuse me, can I just
ask you something real quick?

567
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,987
- You're in training, right?
- Uh-huh.

568
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,507
What are you training for?
A pie-eating contest? Heh.

569
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,503
That's all carbs.

570
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,549
That's good. Maple syrup.
It's healthy.

571
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,511
Some Scotch?

572
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,347
- So when did your mother tell you about me?
- Just last week.

573
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,027
Gotta tell you, if you weren't all over
the news, I don't think she would've.

574
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,185
So how is she?

575
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,028
Well, she's, uh...

576
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,343
She's emotional, you know?

577
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,870
My dad. Her husband, the guy who raised
me, he passed away recently so...

578
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,706
- Ah. Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

579
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,544
- Was he good to you?
- Oh, yeah.

580
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,190
Yeah, he was the best.

581
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,065
So.

582
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,825
What'd she say about me?

583
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,341
That you were pretty
much the worst.

584
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,070
- Really?
- Yeah.

585
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,781
Anything specific?

586
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,426
More specifically.
All right. All right.

587
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,390
She, um... She said
you turned into an asshole.

588
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,030
Heh, that's what she said.

589
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,346
She said you became a womanizer
and a drunk. Loudmouth, you know?

590
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,911
- Is that all?
- That's it.

591
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,542
- That's bullshit.
- Ha, ha.

592
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,067
Well, I was all those things
way before I met your mother.

593
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,384
Yeah, she wasn't too happy about
me coming to see you today so...

594
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,984
Yeah. Well...

595
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,506
Well, why did you?

596
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,784
Guess I was curious.

597
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,390
You were never curious about me?

598
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,540
Your mother asked me to not make any
contact with you so I respected that.

599
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,350
You respected that, but...

600
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,423
You did know you had a son, right?

601
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,027
I wasn't ready to be a dad and your
mother got pregnant accidentally.

602
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,789
You had me and I was a mistake
you didn't want to deal with, right?

603
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,103
- I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay, I get it.

604
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,945
- Don't take it like that.
- I'm not taking it any way.

605
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,583
You're not a mistake. You're here.
The situation was a mistake. I don't know.

606
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,868
It's okay. You don't owe me nothing.
Take that.

607
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,864
- Put that towards your double bypass.
- What's all this about?

608
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,466
When I came here today,
I was pissed off at my mom...

609
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,420
...because she kept you a secret from
me, but I think I get why she did it.

610
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,821
Good luck.

611
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,947
Home, sweet home.

612
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,944
It's exactly the
same as it was 20 years ago.

613
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,381
What's that?

614
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,504
It's my hobby. I got a creative side.
Didn't know that, did you?

615
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,707
No.

616
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,669
So where's the TV?
You don't got a TV?

617
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,504
I don't do TV.

618
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,788
- You don't do TV.
- Mm-mm.

619
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,430
You got an iPad?

620
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,991
No, I got a regular couch.

621
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,510
It's not a couch, dummy.

622
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,986
I know what an iPad is.
I'm just jerking your chain.

623
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,671
Do you know what an iPad is?

624
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,428
Yeah, I do. It's one of those flat things
you push around with your fingers.

625
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,029
It sounds great. Makes me wanna buy one
because you're making it sound so appealing.

626
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,791
Don't use sarcasm on me.
I'm an old man. I confuse easy.

627
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,151
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

628
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,144

anthem as sung by boxing legends...</i>

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,147
Oh, shit.

00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,264

<i>Gave proof to the night</i>

637

Unnecessary.

638

Time to train.

639
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,909
All right. I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

640
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,786
Just...

641
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,071
Unnecessary!

642
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,228
I said it's time to train.

643
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,341
What have I done?

644
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,267
Where's Frankie?

645
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,264
Frankie's not coming till later.
I'm your trainer, Mikey.

646
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,981
You can't be my trainer.
Maybe I'd believe you ate my trainer.

647
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,301
Nice.

648
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,782
<i>Forty-six and chilly downtown.</i>

650
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,267
<i>Highs today in Pittsburgh
only around the 60s.</i>

651
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,548
<i>Grab a sweater and maybe
an extra cup of Joe.</i>

652
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,941
<i>Right now, here's today's six at 6.</i>

653
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,624
Do fighters still do this?
Seems like a lot of cholesterol.

654
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,941
Quiet.

655
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,220
Drink up.

656
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,070
And don't throw up.

657
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,662
Anything good in the
magazine, Mike?

658
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,471
Besides the crumbs from
your breakfast burrito?

659
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,351
Same shit.

660
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,987
Can you believe how bad these Hollywood
stars look without their makeup?

661
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,551
It's horrifying.

662
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,745
What's so funny?

663
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,746
- I was thinking about something.
- Bullshit.

664
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,107
- What are you laughing at?
- Your moobs.

665
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,307
Huh?

666
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,588
- Your moobs.
- My what?

667
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,984
Your moobs, they bounce when
you jump. It's like bad Baywatch.

668
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,344
Let's go, let's go!
You've only got 50 feet to go.

669
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,944
My ass is numb from
this goddamn scooter.

670
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,951
Hey.

671
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,625
You need a lift?

672
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,382
Why'd you come find me again?

673
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,862
Because I knew you didn't mean it.

674
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,386
How you been?

675
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,391
You mean since the last time I saw
you in 1984? I've been okay, thanks.

676
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,065
Hey! You got 50 more feet!

677
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,508
- Don't quit on me now!
- In a minute, Light.

678
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,710
- Lightning?
- Yeah.

679
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,983
Oh, my God.
I can't believe he's still alive.

680
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,381
I mean, not in a bad way.

681
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,584
So why are you here, Sally?

682
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,741
I just think we got off on the wrong
foot at the press thing...

683
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,062
...and I just thought
we could go and talk.

684
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,584
Well, I'm training right now.
Can't do it.

685
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,425
Look, lately,
I've seen a lot of clips of you.

686
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,868
You know, because of the fight
and all and clips of us...

687
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,190
...and I thought I had filed all of
that away some place really neatly...

688
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,581
Well, that's good.
I mean, you were always neat.

689
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,061
You know, Henry, it's taken me
almost 30 years to say this...

690
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,505
...but I truly am sorry.
I apologize.

691
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,111
It's okay.

692
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,388
You look cold. I'm cold.

693
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,742
It's good seeing
you, but I gotta go.

694
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,588
I'm in the phone
book under Anderson.

695
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,462
My late husband's name,
if you ever wanna talk about this.

696
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,464
Why would I ever
wanna talk about this, Sally?

697
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,991
Hey!

698
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,064
Is he a good kid?

699
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,147
The best.

700
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,470
You'd like him.

701
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,985
Well, well.

702
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,705
She's single.

703
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,181
Call her before she remembers
that you're you.

704
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,820
Don't eavesdrop on my
private conversations, okay?

705
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,670
I had my hearing aid turned down.

706
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,141
But you could see she was
sending all the signals.

707
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,066
You could be doing the bone dance with
her instead of welding mice out of crap.

708
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,267
They're dogs.

709
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,030
And I said mind your own business.

710
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,420
Damn it!

711
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,504
Why don't you have a goddamn TV? I could
be watching <i>Dancing With the Stars.</i>

712
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,188
I'm an old guy. I gotta be watching
<i>Dancing With the Stars</i>. I'm serious.

713
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,182
Come on, baby. Come on, old man.

714
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,385
Your timing's off, Kid.

715
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,223
He's out-hustling you, Kid.

716
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,544
Your timing's way off.

717
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,065
Touch him with the jab.

718
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,665
Move your head.

719
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,587
Tap him with that jab.

720
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,061
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop. Shmoo,
ease up. He's like 80 years old.

721
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,745
I am easing up, baby. Come on.

722
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,471
Kid, let's call it a session.
I'm tired just watching.

723
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,391
I can't quit, he's moving too fast.
I can't land anything.

724
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,383
Hey, you think I could just make
a suggestion real quick?

725
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,264
- Come again?
- I won't interrupt.

726
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,066
Just a quick suggestion.
He's got a hitch in his jab.

727
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,222
Try timing it with the right.
See what happens.

728
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,070
- Hey, you his trainer?
- No, I'm not.

729
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,386
Then back the hell off!

730
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,780
All right.

731
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,304
Let's go. Ready? Come on.

732
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,740
Oh!

733
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,784
- Good tip.
- Hey, Kid.

734
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,420
I don't need this shit.
I was doing you a favor.

735
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,901
If you wanna listen to him,
be my guest, all right?

736
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,621
That's my son. He's the first person to talk
to me like a boxer instead of a pair of tits.

737
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,341
Get out of here.

738
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,669
You know what? I'm gonna show you
something, you fat piece of shit.

739
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,390
- What the hell?
- Come back here.

740
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,941
Come back, you fat bastard,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

741
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,465
I'll show you a pair of tits!

742
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,110
So Why'd you come back?

743
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,951
I just wanna give you
these back, all right?

744
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,431
I have a dealership. I can't have my son
drive around in that old piece of shit.

745
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,981
I appreciate the gesture,
all right, but just...

746
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,461
You're not buying me into your life.
It's not gonna happen.

747
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,624
Just take the keys.
Take the keys, please.

748
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,747
- Fine.
- Let it go, Kid.

749
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,867
Hey, what's "BJ" stand for?

750
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,589
Bradley James. It stands for
Bradley James, but I just...

751
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,821
I like BJ.

752
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,141
We all do, kid.

753
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,110
It's one thing to get one
and it's another to be called one.

754
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,581
Oh, that is clever,
I gotta tell you.

755
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,310
Kids in school use to say that...

756
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,145
...until I smacked the loudest one
and made the rest stop.

757
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,501
I'll bet.

758
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,940
So I spent like a month in the principal's
office because of people saying that.

759
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,063
I guess I actually
kind of liked it.

760
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,150
- Fighting, you mean?
- No, the principal. She was hot.

761
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,870
Yeah, well, that sounds familiar.

762
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,149
So you like boxing too?
Noticed this.

763
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,183
I surely got the nose, huh?
Nothing like you.

764
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,709
I had some amateur fights, went to
nationals, but Mom made me quit.

765
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,181
My dad, he signed
me up for football.

766
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,671
How'd you do?

767
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,788
Played corner in college.

768
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,864
But I coach now. I do strength
and conditioning over at Pitt.

769
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,944
- Wow. Panthers. Impressive.
- No.

770
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,229
It's just I got a knack for kicking
fat asses into shape, that's all.

771
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,621
Where'd you get that
smart mouth on you?

772
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,545
- Did the guy who raised you give you that?
- Definitely not.

773
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,830
Ha, ha. No, sir. Funny, nobody could ever
figure it out where I got that from.

774
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,022
Now I'm thinking maybe Mom
had a pretty good idea.

775
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,864
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

776
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,750
Hey, how about you help me?

777
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,947
With What?

778
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,300
Help get me back in shape.

779
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,319
- Like you want me to train you?
- Yeah.

780
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,229
Ha, ha. You're crazy.

781
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,501
- I ain't helping you.
- Huh?

782
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,384
- No, I don't wanna do that.
- Come on.

783
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,589
- I don't think so.
- Come on, just till I find somebody else.

784
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,820
This'll be your salary.

785
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,664
It's a Dodge Dart, not a Porsche. You
act like you're giving me something.

786
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,867
That's a piece of shit.

787
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,864
It is a piece of shit, isn't it?

788
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,301
How about I kick a dent in it,
you'll like it better?

789
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,191
- There's an idea.
- Want me to scratch it up with a key?

790
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,986
Huh?

791
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,384
I tell you what. You've got yourself a
deal. You start tomorrow. Six a.m.

792
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,944
- How about 10:30?
- How about 6 a.m.?

793
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,580
- How about 8:30?
- How about 6 a.m.?

794
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,029
And do me a favor. Lay off the, uh, flapjacks
and the Scotch, all right, Stay Puft?

795
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,622
Mom is not gonna like this one.

796
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,430
Well, we'll turn her.

797
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,309
"We'll turn her"? Good luck.

798
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,303
Oh, by the way, Kid, you, uh...
You got a grandson.

799
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,462
His name's Trey and he's 8.

800
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,142
How do I look in this thing?
Pretty good?

801
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,263
Don't get into an accident.

802
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,787
I'm not sure about this place. Why
don't we go outside and do road work?

803
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,264
No, your legs are fine. It's just the rest
of your muscles are as rusty as my balls.

804
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,105
Hey, Light. Filter.

805
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,466
Hey.

806
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,630
- Your head's making noise.
- You wanna hear a noise?

807
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,989
It's gonna be the sound of you
crying if you don't get out of here.

808
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,825
That was nice.

809
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,348
Like I was saying. We're gonna focus
on your endurance and your speed...

810
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,505
...so you get so fast, he's gonna crawl
right back up into his mama's vagina.

811
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,345
- Hey, Light.
- What?

812
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,343
"What?" Take a Walk.

813
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,981
You sit down right here.

814
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,030
Hey, Moses. Looks like Dundee
found your new sparring partner.

815
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,580
Another funny one, Frank.

816
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,789
- He's closer to a pro fighter in
age than you are.
- Keep it up.

817
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,866
Kid, there's somebody I want
you to meet. My son, Trey.

818
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,307
No way.
My family gets bigger and bigger.

819
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,508
- Can I call you Grandpa?
- No.

820
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,464
No. Kid. Call me Kid.

821
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,344
That seems weird
because you're old.

822
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,039
- Just call him Billy.
- Nice to meet you, Billy.

823
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,079
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm gonna go do my homework.

824
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,545
- Okay.
- Go get them.

825
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,021
- Okay, Dad.
- You ready, Grandpa?

826
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,824
- Don't call me Grandpa.
- Don't like that?

827
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,302
Last night I decided we're going to
train in a very particular way.

828
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,383
We're going to train old school.

829
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,703
None of this...
None of this Pilates crap.

830
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,024
I'm talking real old school. I'm talking
Johnson, I'm talking Dempsey, I'm talking Louis.

831
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,104
And today, we're gonna start
with pool punching.

832
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,830
What's pool punching?

833
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,824
Let's go! Joe Frazier did this three hours
a day! You're not even going five minutes.

834
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,630
Joe Frazier didn't do this.

835
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,066
So what?

836
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,359
Let's go. Let's go. Give me 10.
What do you say?

837
00:45:19,385 --> 00:45:21,055
Attaboy. Let's go, there's one.

838
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,025
And...

839
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,591
...a...

840
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,741
...half.

841
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,265
Are you kidding me?

842
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,582
Really? That's it?

843
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,980
One and a half?

844
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,781
Ali-Frazier.

845
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,786
What did Frazier do? He drove him nuts by
rolling under that right hand and, barn...

846
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,102
...he threw the left hook.
Roll and throw, Kid.

847
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,548
So you work on that,
I'm gonna surprise you with balls.

848
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,146
It reminds me of a woman
I met in Bangkok...

849
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,711
Surprise!

850
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,265
What do you think he's got here?
Hundred? Two hundred acres?

851
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,981
All this stuff here just rusting.

852
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,266
He's sitting on a gold mine.
He's got endless piles of crap.

853
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,991
- Light, you're killing me.
- Put up 100, 150...

854
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,902
...500 condominiums here.

855
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,108
You gotta be quiet. Unh.

856
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,470
Five, six hundred. I bet you $10,000,
he'd sell the whole goddamn thing.

857
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,664
- Unh.
- Don't stop. Don't stop!

858
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,104
Ha, ha!

859
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,467
- Didn't I tell you not to stop?
- Aah!

860
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,100
Ha!

861
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,661
Attaboy.

862
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,101
Let's go, get your elbows up.
Find a rhythm.

863
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,588
Attaboy. Attaboy.

864
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,822
Through the bell, through the bell,
through the bell!

865
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,511
Time! Attaboy. Attaboy.

866
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,910
Sorry you had to see that, Trey.

867
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,347
Hey, Kid.

868
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,464
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm sore.

869
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,223
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I thought you wanted me to hit this.

870
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,384
What are you gonna do? Beat up
the meat? That's not sanitary.

871
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,389
No, we're just here to buy dinner.

872
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,026
- You don't have to punch everything.
- Right.

873
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,701
Let's go, up! Pop. Pop.
Attaboy. Come on! Up! Up!

874
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,708
What is it exactly
that you're doing right now?

875
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,225
- What are you doing?
- Resting.

876
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,781
Taking a rest, huh?
That's gonna get the job done.

877
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,102
Jesus Christ, did you
just fart on me?

878
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,390
Did you just fart on me? Are you
kidding me? You gotta be kidding me.

879
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,430
Good God, come on.
You're better than that.

880
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,107
You kidding me?
You know, my head's right there.

881
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,429
Hey. This is insane.

882
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,271
What? You paratrooped in 'Nam.
What's the problem?

883
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,781
Hey, that was 40 years ago,
for crying out loud.

884
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,546
Shut up! Get out of the plane!
This is great promotion!

885
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,306
Guys, go get ready. Because
the target is right there.

886
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,427
All right, let's go!

887
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,109
- Go now?
- You're good!

888
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,541
Oh, Shit!

889
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,141
Ha-ha-ha!
- God, that felt good.

890
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,463
You jagoff!

891
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,462
- You threw his old ass out the plane!
- Why are you laughing?

892
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,430
I forgot to tell you, first one
down gets an extra five grand.

893
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,588
- Shit!
- Don't forget to pull the string!

894
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,351
Oh.

895
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,190
That's just beautiful! Precious!

896
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,991
Magic!

897
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,663
<i>Sharp and McDonnen made quite the
splash when the two 60-plus fighters...</i>

898
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,664
- Oh, my God. They're nuts!
<i>- ...parachuted into a parking lot.</i>

899
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,340
- Nuts!
<i>- Although their landing...</i>

900
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,871
<i>...didn't go exactly as planned...</i>

901
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,940
<i>- Thank you.
- ...both men walked away...</i>

902
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,869
<i>...with only a few bruises.</i>

903
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,941
Wow.

904
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,029
Okay, new regimen.

905
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,310
Starting today, you're gonna be soaking your
hands in this stuff. Make them leathery.

906
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,867
- What is it?
- It's horse urine.

907
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,382
I'm not sticking my
hand in horse urine.

908
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,020
Oh, you're telling me you're
better than Jack Dempsey?

909
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,862
Because every day Jack Dempsey would
soak his hands in horse urine.

910
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,870
And nobody had a tougher punch
than Jack Dempsey.

911
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,387
Did you heat it up or is it fresh?

912
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,350
- Ha!
- What?

913
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,706
It's vinegar.

914
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,587
- I knew that.
- I'm kidding.

915
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,665
It's horse piss.

916
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,060
It's vinegar.

917
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,746
I'm kidding.

918
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,061
Vinegar.

919
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,867
- I am kidding, actually.
- Come on!

920
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,910
Take a shower. Wash your
hands very, very thoroughly.

921
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,500
- You can still smell the horse piss.
- Wait, don't put it...!

922
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,581
Don't put it in there.
Just throw it in my room.

923
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,027
- Why? What's wrong with...?
- Just get it off the box.

924
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,879
- What do you got in there, the Hope Diamond?
- Don't worry about it.

925
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,948
- Your porn stash?
- It's not funny.

926
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,181
Letters from Sally.

927
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,582
Aw, for God's sakes, call her up!

928
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,225
What are you talking about?

929
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,381
Deal with Sally, or your head won't be clear
and she's gonna screw up your fight again.

930
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,900
- What do you mean, "again"?
- Oh, for God's sakes.

931
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,745
A guy has sex with my girl,
I want to knock his teeth out.

932
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,267
- Why didn't you?
- Because Kid loved boxing.

933
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,111
I wanted to take from him
the one thing he cared about most...

934
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,081
...because that's
what he took from me.

935
00:51:44,107 --> 00:51:46,410
- Well, you sure have a
funny way of showing it.

936
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,940
You're my buddy.
But be careful where you're going...

937
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,904
...because you don't
know anything about it.

938
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,862
Forgive me, but you keep talking
about how much she meant to you.

939
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,462
All I remember is you would show up
at the gym first thing in the morning.

940
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,883
You would be the last
person to leave at night.

941
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:04,173
You didn't have time for
anybody or anything.

942
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,428
You blamed her for ruining
the relationship.

943
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,150
Well, maybe the real
problem was you.

944
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,745
- Trey, you have a good time?
- Yeah, I did.

945
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,461
- I know you're kidding.
- Hey, Sally. Long time.

946
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,319
- Ma, look...
- You're not training this guy.

947
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,627
- It was my idea. Don't get mad at him.
- I'm serious.

948
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,145
- I understand.
- BJ, I'm serious.

949
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,190
What's the point of telling me if you
don't want me interacting with him?

950
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,661
Interacting's one thing.
Working with is another.

951
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,424
- Why?
- You can't be trusted.

952
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,025
He's training me. That's all.

953
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,741
- I don't care!
- Stop yelling!

954
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,188
I think everyone's a little cranky
because they haven't eaten.

955
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,501
I say we do this.

956
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,828
- Burger, burger...
- Salad.

957
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,425
And a glass of white wine.

958
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,181
Works, right?

959
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,865
- That sounds good.
- Sound good?

960
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,386
You know, it might be helpful if you told
us what you hated about the guy so much.

961
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,224
Yeah. He doesn't seem that bad.

962
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,348
- You know I offered to marry her?
- You did?

963
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,504
- He didn't want to marry me.
- No, I offered to marry you.

964
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,871
You also offered to sleep
with my sister the same night.

965
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,505
I can still hear you!

966
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,904
- You did sleep with Carol, my friend.
- That's what she said.

967
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,746
You must be really tired if you fall
asleep with all these people.

968
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,385
- Sometimes people make you tired.
- You know what?

969
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,908
I've got some quarters. Why don't
you go play a game? That'd be fun.

970
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,542
Come on! This is the best dinner
conversation we ever had.

971
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,509
Trey. Why don't you go ahead, okay?

972
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,071
So, what happened?

973
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,746
- I was an idiot.
- No, you weren't an idiot.

974
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,427
- You were young and confused.
- "Confused"? Oh, man.

975
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,106
You thought you liked him.
You realized you loved me.

976
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,629
One thing led to another and I
couldn't handle settling down.

977
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,260
So I was gonna do the right thing.
I was gonna marry you.

978
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,751
I didn't want to marry you.

979
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,749
I didn't love you. I loved him.

980
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,271
Why did you sleep with me?

981
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,581
I was stupid.

982
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,942
Well, girls have slept
with me for less.

983
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,263
There was this one girl, slept with me.
She thought I was Marv Albert.

984
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,503
- Because my haircut was different.
- You are unbelievable.

985
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,863
Why couldn't you pick George Foreman?
We would've been rolling in grill money.

986
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,463
I've been with three people.
Three men in 30 years.

987
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,746
- Mom...
- Two, I loved.

988
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,187
Your father, not him. And Razor.

989
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,064
Ma, don't go.

990
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,541
What a bunch of nonsense.
What is this?

991
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,226
What are you talking about?
It's called promotion, Kid.

992
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,586
- Hey.
- Yes, Razor.

993
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,983
I know we've got a contract, but I
can't stand being around that clown.

994
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,225
What is up with you? Huh? Did you wake
up on the wrong side of the tenement?

995
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,542
Hey, Webster.
Show a little respect.

996
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,426
And I choose to believe that you called me
Webster because of my vocabulary...

997
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,829
...not because of my height and race.
- No, it's because you're short and black.

998
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,709
That's funny. That's real funny.

999
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,828
What was Jesus like?
I'm curious. Was he cool?

1000
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,345
They're ready for you.

1001
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,071
They call your names,
head right up to the octagon.

1002
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,591
The octagon?

1003
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,424
Well, what kind of
stupid sport is this?

1004
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,504
Boxing's better? They fight in a
square and they call it a ring.

1005
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,991
What is the problem, guys?

1006
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,909
- Good point.
- Thank you.

1007
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,460
Walk up on me and I promise
I'm gonna bust your ass.

1008
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,510
Please welcome boxing
legends, Billy "The Kid" McDonnen...

1009
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,344
...and Henry "Razor" Sharp.

1010
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,465
Pleasure to see you.

1011
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,951
Thank you for your time.

1012
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,511
Guys, thank you very much. Welcome.
Thanks for joining us.

1013
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,747
Thanks for having us.

1014
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,709
So, what do you guys
think of the event?

1015
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,104
I mean, no offense, but to me,
next level beyond boxing, huh?

1016
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,308
I don't... I don't get it.

1017
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,184
- Yeah, me either.
- What are you doing?

1018
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,708
If I wanted to see two guys grab
each other's balls...

1019
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,880
...I'd try the men's room
at Kid's restaurant.

1020
00:55:54,906 --> 00:55:56,890
- That's why we throw
him out all the time.

1021
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,705
Called Knocked Out, by the way.
337 Charles Street.

1022
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,703
- Everybody's invited.
- Come on, Kid!

1023
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,830
Listen. You gotta hold it down
because you're driving me crazy.

1024
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,307
I'm sorry. Do I give a shit? No!

1025
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,384
Man, are you gonna be feisty
when you hit puberty.

1026
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,302
What is it that you do not like
about mixed martial arts?

1027
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,940
It's okay. We had a name for guys
that kicked when they fought:

1028
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,147
Girls.

1029
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,663
You know what? I think our audience
is taking offense to the fact...

1030
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,141
...that you don't believe
this is a skilled art form.

1031
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,587
Look at this! Look at this!

1032
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,151
They booing us!

1033
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,067
- What did...?
- Say whatever you want.

1034
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,830
That's great. That's great.

1035
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,426
You can kiss my black ass
if this shit don't happen.

1036
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,546
That's fine.

1037
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,749
Kid, compare MMA to boxing.

1038
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,062
Well, to me,
it's more like pro wrestling.

1039
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,949
Really? Interesting.

1040
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,947
<i>- Chael Sonnen!</i>
- Hey, Grandpa!

1041
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,944
Is this what they call manners?

1042
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,341
You come here to our venue
in front of our fans.

1043
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,548
You're gonna compare
us to rassling?

1044
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,311
Ha. Did he say "rassling"?

1045
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,384
Why don't you stand there in your
sweatshirt and look stupid...

1046
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,470
- ...while I speak to your fellow geriatric?
- Hey.

1047
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,624
Look at this guy. Who are you?
I don't even know what your name is.

1048
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,626
I'm the guy asking you to pick up one of
your arms and throw it in my direction...

1049
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,785
...so I can put you on your ass and you
can tell these fans if it felt scripted.

1050
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,941
Go.

1051
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,386
- Hey.
- Go ahead.

1052
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,147
You know what? Yeah, be my guest. You
take your first shot. I challenge you.

1053
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,109
Hit him! What are you
wasting your time?

1054
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,707
Why are you interrupting? You got some
courage? You want to take a shot?

1055
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,471
I don't want to take a shot.
I want you to smash him.

1056
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,648
Go ahead. Hit him. Hit him.
He wants to be hit.

1057
00:57:35,674 --> 00:57:36,649
Shut up, old man.

1058
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,665
Oh, shit!

1059
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,663
Guess that's that.

1060
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,745
That was a lucky shot.

1061
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,981
<i>Hello?</i>

1062
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,183
Why didn't you say anything?

1063
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,780
It was busy.

1064
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,227
No one's phone is busy
anymore with call waiting.

1065
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,830
It's probably her.

1066
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,431
What? How'd she know?

1067
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,344
Caller ID.

1068
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,388
Would it be easier if I said
she had magic powers?

1069
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,111
- Don't.
- Hold on, Sally.

1070
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,181
Sally. How you doing?

1071
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,183
- Hello.
<i>- Hi. Hey.</i>

1072
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,501
Well, hey.

1073
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,301
Uh, call and hang up,
just like the good old days.

1074
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,784
<i>Heh. You know, I just saw you on TV
punch some guy out.</i>

1075
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,987
<i>I mean, wow.</i>

1076
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,786
I mean, your punch is really great.

1077
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,180
<i>Yeah, I was lucky.</i>

1078
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,183
- No, really.
<i>- I appreciate it. Thanks.</i>

1079
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,549
Listen, I was thinking about
what you were saying about meeting.

1080
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,510
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, you know, just to catch up.

1081
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,549
<i>Sure. I'd love to.</i>

1082
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,190
<i>When?</i>

1083
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,069
Whoa. Wow.

1084
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,143
<i>- Wow, what?
- No, I was just...</i>

1085
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,951
I don't know, maybe tomorrow?
Tomorrow would be good.

1086
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,147
<i>Okay.</i>

1087
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,271
<i>So I'll see you then, okay?</i>

1088
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,181
Whenever you're ready,
come see us. Thank you.

1089
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,585
Judd, what's with the crowd?

1090
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,505
Well, apparently, everybody
wants to buy a car from you.

1091
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,025
Well, that's a good change.

1092
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,864
Hey, what's going on, Lou?

1093
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,103
Nothing. I'm in my office right now.

1094
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,910
Hey, hey, how we selling?

1095
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,381
Oh, that's good.

1096
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,383
No, that's real good, Lou.

1097
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,141
What?

1098
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,711
Are you kidding me right now?

1099
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,743
- Hey, shut up!
- Hold on.

1100
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,069
Don't tell me to shut up! You shut up!
I found out I'm about to be rich.

1101
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,984
You know what?
I'm gonna buy this place...

1102
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,189
...and turn it into a gentlemen's
club and I'm not gonna hire you.

1103
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,105
I'm gonna hire everybody else,
except you two.

1104
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,629
Uh! Uh!

1105
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,664
Hey, way to do it, Kid!

1106
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,423
Look who's here.
Look who's here. Wow.

1107
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,344
Did you see this guy
on TV last night?

1108
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,344
Was that amazing or what?
I mean, you really kicked ass.

1109
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,468
You made us old-timers
look real good last night.

1110
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,300
Kid, you know what I was thinking?
Thought I'd train you today.

1111
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,588
- Yeah? Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1112
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,026
Follow me.

1113
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,508
Johnny, get up in the ring.
Spar with Kid.

1114
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,187
Looking good. Good job, Kid.
It was great last night. All right.

1115
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,190
- Thanks, Frankie.
- Stay loose.

1116
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,911
I like it. You're looking like
new money in there. Ha, ha.

1117
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,266
All right.

1118
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,143
I thought you were
his trainer, Dad.

1119
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,631
Yeah, buddy, so did I.

1120
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,101
Yeah, Frank.

1121
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,343
You know, this is great, Frankie.

1122
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:26,026
Being in the main ring with you and the crew
and all that, but I already have a trainer.

1123
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,989
- Can you stop filming?
- No, don't stop.

1124
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,625
Stop filming.

1125
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,064
What's your problem, Kid?

1126
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,580
I thought you'd be thankful
I was offering to work with you.

1127
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,861
I'm trying to do you a favor.

1128
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,667
I'm grateful. Nice of you to come down
from your mountain to do me this favor...

1129
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,663
...but I don't need a favor.
I need a trainer.

1130
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,900
You stuck me with that guy,
who's such a dumbshit...

1131
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,307
...he doesn't even know
I'm talking about him right now.

1132
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,905
- See?
- It's what it is.

1133
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,381
The only reason you give a shit
is I finally got some heat.

1134
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,747
- Let's be honest, Frank.
- Oh.

1135
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,026
- Really?
- Yeah.

1136
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,545
- Really?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

1137
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,510
Oh, okay. You're the
original media whore.

1138
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,879
- Your mother's a whore.
- What?

1139
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:06,065
Your mother's a whore. And I named my
son after her best trick. Right, BJ?

1140
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,507
Trey, you stay here.

1141
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,947
You call my mother a whore?
You call my mother a whore?

1142
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,864
You call my... Unh!

1143
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,911
Well, that's that.

1144
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,586
Start the car.

1145
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,230
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

1146
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,870
Let's go, yeah. Let's go, Dad.

1147
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,107
Dad? What do the letters in your
name mean? The B and the J?

1148
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,945
You gotta be kidding me.
You see what you started?

1149
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,102
You started this.

1150
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,501
Well, you know, Trey?
I'll answer that.

1151
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,180
B and J stands for...

1152
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,465
"butterscotch jellybeans." Really?

1153
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,588
A lot of guys
like butterscotch jellybeans.

1154
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,151
But you know the problem?

1155
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,105
Sometimes, women don't like to
give guys butterscotch jellybeans.

1156
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,747
- Ha-ha-ha.
- I love butterscotch jellybeans a lot.

1157
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,109
I like to have, like, 100 a day.

1158
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,230
Well, what an appetite you have.
Boy, oh, boy.

1159
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,264
Hey, you know, uh,
what you did back there...

1160
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,470
...you stepping up like that.

1161
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,305
I appreciate it.
I just want to let you know.

1162
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,148
I don't have any use
for that jagoff.

1163
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,746
Crap, I'm gonna be late
for football practice.

1164
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,187
- Hey, Trey-Trey, you got your stuff, right?
- Yep.

1165
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,071
I'm gonna drop you off at
grandma's on the way to Kid's.

1166
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,506
I wanna stay with Kid.

1167
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,788
Oh, you wanna stay
with Kid? Well, you can't.

1168
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,511
No, you know what?
Maybe he could stay over tonight.

1169
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,106
We can have like a sleepover.
What do you think? Huh?

1170
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,581
- Yeah!
- You like that?

1171
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,505
Your grandmother will have my hide.
It ain't happening.

1172
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,185
- Come on!
- Look what you started.

1173
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,468
- Come on! Please!
- You gotta jump in there too?

1174
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,304
Yeah, you're the dad. Come on.

1175
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,667
- Please.
- All right, all right. I tell you what.

1176
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,189
You can stay, as long as we
make it a dudes-only secret.

1177
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,311
Works for me. You know dude secrets
are very important in life, Trey.

1178
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,428
Your buddies, they
gotta look out for you.

1179
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,266
Like, if you're in a movie and you start
crying, you don't want people to know.

1180
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,661
They won't tell anybody
because they're your buddies.

1181
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,948
They cover for you when
you get in trouble...

1182
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,900
...like when you have a gambling problem
or an unexpected visit in the drunk tank.

1183
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,951
- I think he probably he gets the point.
- No, he's a very smart, intelligent kid.

1184
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,590
It's amazing you're 8 years old.

1185
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,505
I thought you'd be maybe
like 9 or 10, or even 11.

1186
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,503
- I'm almost 9.
- Almost 9.

1187
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,028
Dad, for my birthday can I
have butterscotch jellybeans?

1188
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,461
Ha-ha-ha. I don't know, bud.

1189
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,544
- You got a few years to wait on that one.
- Please?

1190
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,105
So...

1191
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,344
...anyone in your life these days?

1192
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,187
There's been a few over the years.

1193
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,791
They stick around for a while, and
then they see these kind of, uh...

1194
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,147
...Oprah shows about relationships.

1195
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,065
They tell me, "How come you don't
talk about your feelings more?"

1196
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,064
And I say, "Well, women are
more verbal than men."

1197
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,383
And they go, "Huh?"
And "What?" Heh.

1198
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,905
Then they leave.

1199
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,301
Wow, listen to you.

1200
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,303
"Women are more verbal than men."

1201
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,964
Yeah, I read an article in
Time magazine that's called:

1202
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:00,570
"Women are More Verbal than Men."

1203
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,751
It's true.

1204
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,471
You know, I know it was
a long time ago, but...

1205
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,383
...what happened? Really.

1206
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,744
You were everything in my life.

1207
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,990
Then Kid beat you.

1208
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,941
And you were different.

1209
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,226
And I was lost.

1210
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,348
And everything started
to fall apart.

1211
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,226
Listen. This is ancient history.

1212
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,262
I put it behind me. And I don't
wanna get emotional about it.

1213
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,430
I hope you've put it behind you.
I just want to keep it calm.

1214
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,627
But why him?

1215
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,431
I mean, seriously,
of all the people in the world?

1216
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,068
I can't get it through my head.

1217
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,625
I lay in bed at night.

1218
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,590
I want to pound my head against...
I dream about killing this guy.

1219
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,744
Why him? He's the worst
guy in the world.

1220
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,471
- Why?
- Okay. Okay.

1221
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,984
Remember when you went to
the Catskills to train?

1222
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,428
You wanted to be alone.
You wouldn't return my calls.

1223
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,991
Six months turned into a year.

1224
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,269
I know that now, but I was
focused on winning the title.

1225
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,220
I know that. I know that.
But I was so in love with you.

1226
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,827
And I even flew up to surprise you.

1227
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,630
And then I saw you with that woman.

1228
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,626
I didn't know her. Nothing happened. I had
no idea who she was. She just showed up.

1229
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,827
What did I know?

1230
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,143
I just wanted to hurt you as much
as I thought you had hurt me.

1231
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,301
And so...

1232
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,667
Kid.

1233
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,827
Kid.

1234
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,504
Kid. All right.

1235
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,150
I understand.

1236
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,464
Wow.

1237
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,351
I think we've depressed the shit
out of these pigeons.

1238
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,468
- No, don't say that. Right?
- Ha, ha.

1239
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,701
It's the first time taking
you alone. You nervous?

1240
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,548
For you, maybe. If I told my dad you
used a 12 pack of beer for a car seat...

1241
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,906
...he will not be happy.

1242
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,388
He should've given us one, but you
know what? It'll be our secret.

1243
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,067
- And I'll drive slow. All right?
- Mm-hm.

1244
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,703
So, what do you wanna do
tonight, huh? Go to the movies?

1245
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,902
If it's PG-13 or R. I don't do G.

1246
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,703
- Oh, wow. You're old for your years.
- You too.

1247
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,146
Yeah. Dante.

1248
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,870
We bigger than Pittsburgh, Kid!

1249
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,068
<i>- Well, what do you mean?</i>
- What's it mean?

1250
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,063
It means we sold too many seats.
It means we need a bigger venue.

1251
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,143
<i>Dude, the UFC thing
put us over the top.</i>

1252
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,101
- How we gonna get a new venue?
<i>- What do you mean? It's already done!</i>

1253
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,911
<i>The Consol Energy Center wants us!
Eighteen thousand seats.</i>

1254
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,984
- You messing with me?
- No, I ain't messing, you geriatric prick.

1255
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,103
<i>Pay-per-view and HBO too.
I forgot that.</i>

1256
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,504
<i>Let me tell you, if people buy this thing,
do you understand this will set us straight?</i>

1257
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,071
<i>A different type of money.</i>

1258
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,383
I'm talking about that Kardashian
sex tape type money.

1259
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,781
- Don't mess with me, man.
- This is real, man.

1260
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,101
<i>This is money, baby!</i>

1261
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,103
Yeah, good. All good. Good.

1262
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,821
- I just wanted to let you know.
- Good.

1263
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,749
- Bye, man.
- Thanks.

1264
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,626
Yeah.

1265
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,863
I'm making it, baby!

1266
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,941
I left my keys in the house.
Goddamn it.

1267
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,024
So since we established
that I've never been that verbal...

1268
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,469
...and even you told me I had a hard
time communicating. Remember that?

1269
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,022
- Uh, yeah.
- You didn't have to say it like that. Heh.

1270
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,710
Well, you were right.

1271
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,624
And I worked at it.

1272
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:35,581
I started making things
from junk or objects...

1273
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,304
...that I found at the yard.
And I made this for you.

1274
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,383
Oh, it's darling.

1275
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,427
- It's...
- A mouse, I guess.

1276
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,301
No, it looks more like a dog.
Yeah, it's a dog.

1277
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,425
- When did all this start?
- I don't know. A long time ago.

1278
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,103
It's just that some people look at old rusty
scrap metal and say, "Ah, that's just junk."

1279
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,671
But I see something else.

1280
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,825
Oh!

1281
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,984
That's beautiful! I love that.

1282
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,985
Excuse me, Mr. Sharp.

1283
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,302
You have a phone call
from a Mr. Dante Slate.

1284
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,666
Please tell him I'm busy.

1285
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:14,667
I'm afraid he insisted that it was quote, "mad
important," and that "shit just got real."

1286
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,431
Maybe you should take it
because it's mad important.

1287
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,820
Shit just got real.

1288
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,670
Heh. Okay.

1289
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,826
- Am I missing something here?
- What?

1290
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,221
Dante just told you you're
playing the Consol Center.

1291
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,701
- Yeah?
- And you act more nervous than excited.

1292
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,703
No, listen, I'm excited.

1293
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,340
I don't drive a lot at night
and I'm concentrating.

1294
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,621
This is gonna be huge...

1295
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,190
- Unh. Ooh.
- Sally!

1296
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,107
Are you okay?
No, you're cut up here.

1297
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,353
I never saw that guy.
He came out of nowhere.

1298
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:51,250
I swear to God, I never saw him.
Jesus!

1299
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,545
You guys all right?

1300
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,947
You guys Okay?

1301
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,588
Pay-per-view! Pay-per-view!
Pay-per-view!

1302
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:03,910
- It's gonna be real.
Can you believe this?

1303
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,506
I'm not believing
you brought this boy to the bar.

1304
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,866
We're going to the movies.

1305
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,024
We will. We're just gonna
celebrate for a little bit, okay?

1306
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,909
Keep an eye on him, Joey, okay?

1307
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,230
Now you all have to chug!

1308
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,785
Now we all have to chug!

1309
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,062
Let's you and I get out of here.

1310
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,830
Well, I can't, I got him, so...

1311
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,028
He's fine. He's having fun.

1312
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,023
Look. Time of his life.

1313
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,746
Come on.

1314
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,430
We'll be quick about it.

1315
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,343
What do you think?
Will it leave a scar?

1316
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,016
Well, it's running right
along your hairline,

1317
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,974
so I doubt you'll notice a thing.

1318
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,785
- Unless I go bald.
- Which, of course, you won't.

1319
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,461
You won't, I promise.
But if you do...

1320
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,082
...you're gonna be one
smoking hot bald lady with

1321
01:11:08,108 --> 01:11:10,412
a little scar that I'd
love to hang outwith.

1322
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,781
- Okay. You folks have a good evening.
- Same.

1323
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,781
- Thank you.
Look at the two of you.

1324
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,311
Who would have thunk it?

1325
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,985
Lightning, hi.

1326
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,466
- Good to see you, Sally.
- Hi.

1327
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,782
Strange how life works out, huh?

1328
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:25,268
Oh, I'm flashing on to a stripper
I knew once in Korea.

1329
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,227
She never charged me. Not even
for the most daring requests.

1330
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,826
I keep hoping I'd run
into her again someday.

1331
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,302
- Her and her ping-pong ball.
- Ooh. Hey.

1332
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,304
I'm just saying, seeing the two
of you together gives me hope.

1333
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,189
Aw, that's sweet.

1334
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,183
- No, it's not.
- I think.

1335
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,990
You look good. So how you feeling?

1336
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,826
- Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. No big deal at all.
- Good.

1337
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,740
Listen, can I talk to
you for a minute?

1338
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,991
- So, what'd you want to talk about?
- Call it.

1339
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,264
Come on, I wasn't paying attention.

1340
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,309
When were you going to tell me
you're blind in one eye?

1341
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,581
How'd you know?

1342
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,187
How'd I know? When that bum
bitch-slapped you at the UFC fight.

1343
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:14,026
A two-year-old could've seen that
coming. When were you gonna tell me?

1344
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,386
What happened?

1345
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,867
A crucible blew up at the yard
a couple of years ago.

1346
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,863
Detached the retina. I
thought it would heal.

1347
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,083
I figured I could get by.

1348
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:29,572
"Get by"? Not only did
you put Sally at risk...

1349
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,670
...if he finds out he can hit you
on the right, he can kill you.

1350
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,949
Then I go to my left.
I need to do this, Light.

1351
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,384
Look, I know you're doing this for my
sake and I appreciate it. Believe me.

1352
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,545
It's too dangerous.

1353
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,669
We gotta call off the fight.

1354
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,346
I'm tired. Have you seen Kid?

1355
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,703
No. You know, go over
there and try his office.

1356
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,866
He's cute.

1357
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,510
You're cute.

1358
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,867
You look exactly
like Angelina Jolie.

1359
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,026
Kid?

1360
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,591
You in here?

1361
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,980
Kid?

1362
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,746
- Holy shit!
- Trey!

1363
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,064
- What are you doing?
- You scared me!

1364
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,466
Stop the car!

1365
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,749
- Why is your shirt off?
- Stop the car. Turn around and stop the car.

1366
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,631
- I can't reach the brakes, Grandpa!
- Don't call me Grandpa.

1367
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,624
- Get off the seat and press the brake.
- Sir! Go on! Get it!

1368
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,066
Press the brake down there.

1369
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,264
Go down and press the brake.
Press the brake!

1370
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,062
- Ugh.
- Please don't tell my dad.

1371
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,463
Oh, no, no. Never. This is our big
dude secret. Never. Lifelong.

1372
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,101
Uh-oh.

1373
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,944
Oh, my goodness.

1374
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,784
- Lightning's right.
- Why is he right?

1375
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,591
- Why is he right and I'm wrong?
- You can't do this fight.

1376
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,665
- I'm in the best shape I've been in 20 years.
- You can't risk it. Why?

1377
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,949
What have you wanted
most for the last 30 years?

1378
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,181
This fight...

1379
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,544
...or something else?

1380
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,106
Excuse me.

1381
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,785
Trey? Trey?

1382
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,186
Dad!

1383
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,141
I turned my back, like,
for a minute. That was it.

1384
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,827
Turn your back in a bar? What'd you
say to me? What did you say?

1385
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,029
You said, "Dinner, maybe a movie."
Then you took my son to a bar.

1386
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,818
Dad, it's not his fault.
Or the naked lady's.

1387
01:15:05,844 --> 01:15:06,527
What?

1388
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,861
One night I ask you to step up, like a
father, and you can't keep it together.

1389
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,069
Come on, BJ. Nobody got hurt.
Everybody's okay. Come on.

1390
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,700
"Everybody's okay"?
Who's okay? I'm not okay.

1391
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,544
Kid, all right? It's my son.

1392
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,670
He means everything to me. A concept
you would never understand.

1393
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,027
- Come on.
- No, no. Listen to me.

1394
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,427
I'm gonna need you
to stay away from us, okay?

1395
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,823
You stay away from me. You stay
away from my son. That's it.

1396
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:44,543
Hey! Look at you.
Still alive, defying the odds. Heh.

1397
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:49,667
Ha, ha. Good one. Makes it a lot
easier for me to say what I gotta say.

1398
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,547
- He's out.
- "Out"? What do you mean "out"?

1399
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,101
- Fight's off. See you.
- "See you"?

1400
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,098
Hey! Wait, ain't
no damn "see you."

1401
01:15:57,124 --> 01:16:00,246
Get back here, you wrinkled,
Hobbit-faced son of a bitch.

1402
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,501
I got a contract.

1403
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,822
- Razor is gonna fight.
- He's not gonna fight.

1404
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,269
Take some of the money your father skimmed
off Razor, get yourself a new guy.

1405
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,070
Razor's not gonna fight.

1406
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,427
You know what?
Screw you and screw my dad.

1407
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,708
You think you the only one
that got ripped off? Huh?

1408
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,106
Only thing my dad left
me was a bad reputation,

1409
01:16:17,132 --> 01:16:18,890
which is why I need
this to happen.

1410
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,103
I got a boy in private school,
which means he has white friends...

1411
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,183
...which means he wants
white people shit.

1412
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:27,469
He asked me for a bar mitzvah. Any
idea how expensive that shit is?

1413
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,707
It's expensive!

1414
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:34,586
I feel your pain and I'm sorry your father was
such a prick, but Razor's not doing the fight.

1415
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,907
Let me tell you something.
I'll tell you what's...

1416
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,266
I'm talking to you.

1417
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,782
You not even gonna storm off in a
fast fashion? You gonna walk slow?

1418
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,105
For you to walk off makes me look...

1419
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,902
Oh, shit!

1420
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,228
Yo, I gotta take the car back?

1421
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,188
<i>Gone astray is the bluebird</i>

1422
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,743
<i>Here to stay is the new bird</i>

1423
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:04,264
<i>He sings a love song
As we go along</i>

1424
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,828
Dante. This better be good news
because I can't handle anything bad.

1425
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,710
- Where are you, Sally Rose?
- Hey.

1426
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,907
Hey.

1427
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,506
- I've got a really great idea.
- Okay, let's hear it.

1428
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,707
How about this?

1429
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,669
Ow. Heh, ow.

1430
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,026
- We go out of town.
- Yeah?

1431
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,660
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay. Let's do it. Where?

1432
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,302
Do you remember how we always loved
the Adirondacks and we never went?

1433
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,064
- Yeah.
- Millions of times, right?

1434
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,346
Right. Millions of leaves.

1435
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,867
- And we regretted it, right?
- Yeah.

1436
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,506
Well, okay, what? No more regrets?

1437
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,423
Jesus! Aah!

1438
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,426
You gonna quit again?
Again, you're gonna quit?

1439
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,947
- Get out of here, Kid.
- No way. I don't think so.

1440
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,502
No, no. I'm not gonna get out of here
till you say you're gonna fight me.

1441
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,308
- Oh! What are you doing, you moron?
- Oh, will you look...? I can't believe this.

1442
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,709
- Get out of here, Kid.
- Is that why you quit? Because of her?

1443
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,505
- Because of her? Did she make you quit?
- Henry.

1444
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,021
Hey, you made me wait 30 years to prove
to the world I could kick your ass.

1445
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,984
And that's what I'm gonna do,
kick your ass

1446
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,547
- You're gonna move on. Move on!
- What, move on?

1447
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,863
Now that you got her, you want me
to move on? And what do I got?

1448
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,221
Nothing. Nothing.

1449
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,031
How do you live with yourself
knowing that we tied?

1450
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,390
There was no grudge match.
You never beat me.

1451
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,508
I was there! He kicked your ass!

1452
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,910
He didn't kick my ass. He knew I wasn't
ready for that fight. He didn't do shit.

1453
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,062
I lost because I was out of shape.

1454
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,666
The first one, I kicked his ass
because I was in shape.

1455
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,663
- You're pathetic.
- "You're pathetic."

1456
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,551
Go ahead, tell her!
Tell her! Tell her!

1457
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,226
- He wasn't ready.
- Yeah, see?

1458
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,528
You were afraid of that fight.

1459
01:18:48,554 --> 01:18:50,581
Not even a little. I
was gonna knock you out!

1460
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,989
- Yeah? Well, let's do it now, then!
- Look at us. What are you talking about?

1461
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,864
Yeah, look at us! We're not dead!

1462
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,427
- Everybody's laughing! The world's laughing!
- Right.

1463
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:04,108
But we're not dead. In fact, this whole thing
has made me feel more alive than ever!

1464
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,741
You? What about you?

1465
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,261
- Huh? Don't let her get in the way.
- Leave her out of it.

1466
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,141
- Or what? You're not gonna fight?
- Leave her out of it. You and me.

1467
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,581
- Yeah! It's me and you! Right!
- You're a child.

1468
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,256
What are you doing? Give
him his balls back!

1469
01:19:16,282 --> 01:19:18,971
Let him fight me! Let him
reclaim his manhood!

1470
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,102
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.

1471
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:26,107
This is our last chance. Let's finish
this once and for all. Come on. Come on!

1472
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,387
Come on.

1473
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,424
It ain't gonna happen.

1474
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,226
Wha...?

1475
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,224
What are you doing?

1476
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,665
I'm done. Come on.

1477
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,347
Hey.

1478
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,902
Don't make a mess,
or I have to clean it up.

1479
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,985
Walter. Are you working here now?
I didn't know that.

1480
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:24,027
Yeah, man. You know, well, it's always
been my life passion, to wait tables.

1481
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,069
Well, a job's a job, right?

1482
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,585
- I am not complaining.
- Right.

1483
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,185
I'm happy to have a job.

1484
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,941
It would kill me
if I couldn't bet on you, man.

1485
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:37,501
I don't know about the betting. You know,
things happen. You never know for sure.

1486
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,022
Me and a bunch of guys from the plant,
we're gonna be in the nosebleeds.

1487
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,227
That's nice of you.

1488
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,180
Don't let this high-paying job
fool you. We could all use a win.

1489
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,503
- And that sorry-ass burger is on me.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1490
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,027
- Be cool, man.
- All right, man.

1491
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,386
I got it.

1492
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,715
Hey, Trey. Let's go!
Breakfast is on the table.

1493
01:21:38,741 --> 01:21:40,968
I don't wanna be waiting on you.
Five minutes.

1494
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,301
Okay, Dad.

1495
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,189
- Hey.
- Hey.

1496
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,390
- You're BJ?
- Yeah, that's right. How you doing?

1497
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,101
Mom, she's told me all about you.

1498
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,546
You know, recently.

1499
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,903
- You look like her.
- Really?

1500
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,107
No, not really.

1501
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,262
Heh. I was gonna say.
Come on inside.

1502
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,468
Hey, Ma, Razor's here.

1503
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,708
Can I get you something?
Some juice?

1504
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,544
No, I'm okay.

1505
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,591
Listen, don't tell my morn I said this.
If she knew, she'd stab me with a fork...

1506
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:13,540
...but I think she's really glad you're
around. She thinks you're a good guy.

1507
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,385
I don't know,
I just wanted you to know that.

1508
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,426
- Thank you. I like that.
- Good.

1509
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,945
Hey, Ma.

1510
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,741
Excuse me. Heh.
I'm gonna let you guys be.

1511
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,947
Okay.

1512
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,191
- Good kid.
- He's a good boy.

1513
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,304
I'm gonna fight.

1514
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,230
Don't let him use me to
shame you into doing this.

1515
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,951
I'm not. I'm not.

1516
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,705
Not at all.

1517
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,867
I made so many mistakes, Sally.
I made so many.

1518
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,103
Maybe I shouldn't have
quit boxing 30 years ago.

1519
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,025
Maybe I should've spent more time
with you. I ignored you so much.

1520
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,104
Maybe I could've forgiven you
and helped raise your kid.

1521
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,826
Maybe I could've done so
many things that I didn't do.

1522
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,950
I just don't wanna make any
more mistakes. I'm done with that.

1523
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,865
I let him take from me...

1524
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:09,662
...the two things
that mattered most:

1525
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,949
You and boxing. I just shut it out.

1526
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,742
I don't even have a TV.

1527
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,021
Can you believe that?

1528
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,627
Because I'm afraid I might flip
to a fight by accident...

1529
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:25,142
...and be embarrassed because I'm
a fighter. I was born to be a fighter.

1530
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,428
I had some talent. I did.

1531
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,146
And I just walked away so early.

1532
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,585
I love you.

1533
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,782
Always have. Always will.

1534
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,906
You're stuck with me, believe me.

1535
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:50,071
But I've always regretted
not beating Kid at his best.

1536
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,541
No matter how hard you guys work,
it won't be your best.

1537
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,149
It's the best we got.

1538
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,907
Then go kick his ass.

1539
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,307
Well, since you put it like that.

1540
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,989
Heh, he's a dead man.

1541
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,140
Stay left.

1542
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,747
Stay left.

1543
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,664
Left. Left!

1544
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,304
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo!

1545
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,986
I think I might be ready.

1546
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,981
Yeah, you're ready.
You're a one-eyed monster.

1547
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,591
Agh!

1548
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:48,062
Okay, so this is my VIP section,
I need to fill it with VIPs. Understand?

1549
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,661
I want a Kardashian.
Give me a big-tittied Playmate.

1550
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,188
Whatever pussy actor that played
a boxer in a movie, I want him.

1551
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,024
- Lou, you got anybody?
- My mother.

1552
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:59,024
These are VIP. That woman can't see.
I can put her up top. She can hear.

1553
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,679
- She's looking forward to this.
- I'm not gonna waste that time.

1554
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:03,350
Down! Set.

1555
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,346
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1556
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,581
BJ, you got a visitor.

1557
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,505
They're yours, coach.

1558
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,386
All right, listen up!

1559
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,221
Look, I know you got every right
to hate me. And I don't blame you.

1560
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,902
But I need you now.
I need you in my corner.

1561
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,950
You're the best person for me.

1562
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,307
I know I wasn't there
for you and Trey.

1563
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,427
I can't take that back.
I can't fix it.

1564
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,465
I brought him these.

1565
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,702
- Butterscotch jellybeans.
- Heh.

1566
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,187
Figure he's old enough now.

1567
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,025
- Yeah, you're really not very good at this.
- No, I'm not.

1568
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,740
But I'm trying, you know.

1569
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,344
And I brought this too.

1570
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,869
I collected these over the years.
Just so you know the whole story.

1571
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,389
Hello again, everybody. I'm Jim
Lampley and welcome to Pittsburgh...

1572
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:33,102
...where a raucous sold-out crowd has
assembled for this unique grudge match.

1573
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,104
Now, you stand to the left
and you keep him in your vision.

1574
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,910
- I will. Don't worry.
- I am worried.

1575
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,946
I love you like a son,
but I'm telling you right now:

1576
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,068
If you're taking a beating,
I'm throwing this in.

1577
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,109
- Don't do that.
- I'm gonna. I'm not asking.

1578
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,864
I am telling you.

1579
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,704
I'll also tell you something else.

1580
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,989
If you beat this mug, there's gonna be
a new television in the living room.

1581
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,221
I don't want one.

1582
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,462
Not for you. For me.

1583
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,429
I gotta tell you. It's probably the
shittiest wrap job I ever seen.

1584
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,311
Thought maybe you could
use a little help today, huh?

1585
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,747
Yeah, I could. Sure.

1586
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,823
Remember what I taught you.
Don't mess this up.

1587
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,982
Just sit back and relax.
I'm doing it perfect.

1588
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,599
- You've got fragile hands.
- You're a stubborn son of a bitch.

1589
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,067
Where do you think I got it from?
Ha-ha-ha.

1590
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,825
- Guys, it's time.
- Showtime.

1591
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,501
Okay.

1592
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,030
- Be careful.
- Let's go! You ain't getting any younger!

1593
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,781
Nice.

1594
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,146
Time, guys.

1595
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,302
All right. All right,
we'll be right there.

1596
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,586
Breathe for me.

1597
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,305
Breathe, that's it.

1598
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,030
Okay. That's it.

1599
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,350
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1600
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,065
You think I still got it?

1601
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,710
I think you still got it.

1602
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,864
Hey, somehow,
you never lost it. All right?

1603
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,667
Good.

1604
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,860
Let's go to work.

1605
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,665
Let's do this.

1606
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,746
I guess the city of Pittsburgh missed all the
fanfare about what a joke this fight is.

1607
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,380
- This is some crowd.
- This could be good.

1608
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,991
Holy shit.

1609
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,706
Well put.

1610
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,189
Going without the scooter?

1611
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,421
You kidding me?

1612
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:09,062
With all that hot talent out there,
I can land me some snapper tonight.

1613
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,745
I just threw up in my mouth.

1614
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,626
<i>And here comes
Billy "The Kid" McDonnen.</i>

1615
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:36,023
<i>McDonnen, if you're dusting off your history
book, was 41-1 in his 12-year career.</i>

1616
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,626
<i>The one loss was against Sharp.</i>

1617
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,625
That's the Kid!

1618
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,304
<i>And now, Razor Sharp
makes his way into the arena.</i>

1619
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,508
<i>It's not very often
we've seen a crowd in one city...</i>

1620
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,981
<i>...so evenly divided, Jim.</i>

1621
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:35,506
<i>In his nine-year career, Sharp
had 33 professional wins and only 1 loss.</i>

1622
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,469
<i>And we all know who that was to.</i>

1623
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,185
Welcome to this evening's
very special main event.

1624
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,229
Ladies and gentleman...

1625
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:50,705
...let's get ready to rumble!

1626
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,100
Introducing first, fighting
out of the blue corner...

1627
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,501
...wearing his trademark
kelly-green trunks...

1628
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:00,506
...and weighing in at 175 pounds,
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania...

1629
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,821
Yeah, Kid!

1630
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,062
"Fighting out of the
Kid McDonnen Auto Mall...

1631
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,945
...where zero percent financing
will knock you out."

1632
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,544
- Open Sundays!
- Oh, come on, man.

1633
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,671
The former Light Heavyweight
Champion of the world...

1634
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:19,224
...Billy "The Kid" McDonnen!

1635
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,384
And fighting out of
the red corner...

1636
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,144
...wearing white with black...

1637
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,190
...weighing in at 178 pounds...

1638
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,581
...also from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania...

1639
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,747
...former Light Heavyweight World
Champion...

1640
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:41,225
...Henry "Razor" Sharp!

1641
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,870
All right, boxers out.

1642
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,742
Boxer out, one second.

1643
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:57,064
All right, gentlemen.
You had my detailed instructions.

1644
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,700
I expect you to obey
my commands at all times.

1645
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,425
Protect yourself at all times.

1646
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,911
Are there any questions?

1647
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,540
Gutsy move going without a bra.

1648
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:09,108
I've got a surprise for you when you
get home. I took a shit on your porch.

1649
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,184
- We are live, guys. We are live right now.
- Touch them up.

1650
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,589
Is this about me and you? Or her?

1651
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,109
Me and you.

1652
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,230
Oh, thank God. I thought he was
gonna say it was about the shit.

1653
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,066
And here we go.

1654
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,906
Box!

1655
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,703
<i>We can expect both men
to feel each other out at this point.</i>

1656
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,910
<i>Sharp not looking
very Sharp at the moment.</i>

1657
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,461
<i>Well, that's no surprise
after a 30-year layoff.</i>

1658
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,941
<i>And there's a wild hook by
Billy "The Kid" that misses by a mile.</i>

1659
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,148
Don't load up, Pop! Don't load up!

1660
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,587
<i>Lots of rust on both sides.</i>

1661
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:56,823
<i>- What do you think of this so far?
- It's not pretty at all.</i>

1662
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,823
Let's go, let's go.
Let's start the fight.

1663
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,382
<i>Now Sharp stepping forward
a little more assertively behind that jab.</i>

1664
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,905
<i>McDonnen says, "Come on."</i>

1665
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,824
Come on, Kid! Roll and throw.

1666
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,823
<i>Sharp jabbing, then backing up.</i>

1667
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,666
- That's it!
<i>- Razor was hurt by that punch!</i>

1668
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,421
- Dear God.
<i>- And, boom, there it is.</i>

1669
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,823
- Kid's famous left hook finally showed up.
<i>- Might've hurt Razor.</i>

1670
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,422
- Razor appears cut above his right eye.
<i>- Razor is cut.</i>

1671
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,261
Come on!

1672
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,541
<i>Bell sounds.</i>

1673
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,543
- What?
- Hey.

1674
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,191
<i>That was a hard right
hand immediately after the bell.</i>

1675
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:50,307
- That will lead to a point deduction.
- That can cost the Kid a round.

1676
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:51,700
Give him some water.

1677
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,386
- You're doing real good, you pussy.
- That's not helping.

1678
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,224
I'm 800 years old,
I say what I want.

1679
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,060
- Can you stop the bleeding?
- For a while.

1680
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,069
What are you doing,
hitting him after the bell?

1681
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,826
You're gonna get us thrown out.
I need you to be smart.

1682
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,784
- All right?
- Relax.

1683
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,711
- He's gonna figure you out.
- Either way, I'm taking him out.

1684
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,504
- Do it quick.
- Right.

1685
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,148
<i>And now round two
is about to get underway.</i>

1686
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,383
<i>Have to give round
one to Sharp after that foul.</i>

1687
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,951
Roll and throw, Kid!

1688
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,743
<i>And Razor Sharp will waste
no time pressing his advantage.</i>

1689
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,026
Come on, Kid. Move that head.

1690
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,426
- Unh!
- Oh!

1691
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,911
<i>Razor is unrelenting.
Pounding away.</i>

1692
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,865
- All right! All right!
- Roll and throw!

1693
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,264
<i>Razor continues to unload.</i>

1694
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,706
- Down goes Kid on a massive left hand.
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>

1695
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,541
<i>Referee Pat Russell
will pick up the count.</i>

1696
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,748
You got him! You got him!
Now finish him!

1697
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,183
<i>The Kid is taking
a ton of punishment...</i>

1698
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,502
<i>...but that's always
been a part of his game.</i>

1699
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,624
<i>- He's stronger than he looks.</i>
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

1700
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,545
<i>He's got Kid in trouble.</i>

1701
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,945
<i>- Oh, got him.
- Down he goes!</i>

1702
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,749
Get over there! Two!

1703
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,790
He must just be thinking:
"Why in the hell did I do this?"

1704
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,704
Roll and throw! Do it now!

1705
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,706
You have got to start slipping punches and
letting your hands go. Roll and throw.

1706
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,591
- You hear me? Roll and throw.
- Seven! You getting up?

1707
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,310
Eight! Walk to me.

1708
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,221
You okay, Kid?

1709
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,791
Show me something. Box!

1710
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:35,105
Get out of the corner! It's a trap!
Get out of the corner!

1711
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,671
Now! Right now!

1712
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,301
Oh, boy!

1713
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,825
- Attaway, Kid!
- Goddamn it!

1714
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,505
Now, let your hands go! That's it!

1715
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,670
- Bell! Time!
<i>- No boxing here.</i>

1716
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,629
<i>This is an all-out war.</i>

1717
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:55,827
Let's go, baby!

1718
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,667
Attaboy! Attaboy! Way to work!

1719
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,584
Listen, he's got you figured out.

1720
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,505
- So what?
- So I'm gonna call the fight.

1721
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,948
He's slipping. Now you're fighting smart.
Keep that pressure on him.

1722
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,511
Do not let up. Do not let up.

1723
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,584
- You want to get your head bashed in?
- Don't worry about it.

1724
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,186
- I'm watching that.
- It's all right.

1725
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,580
I'm fine.

1726
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,500
He's going down.
He's a sucker for the left.

1727
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,344
Stay on him.
Breathe for me. That's it.

1728
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,941
<i>I have to give that round to Kid.</i>

1729
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,502
<i>That round dominated by Sharp.</i>

1730
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,824
<i>It's been a hellacious
display of courage by both fighters.</i>

1731
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,541
<i>Kid has Razor in trouble.</i>

1732
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,226
That's it! Bell!

1733
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,191
I'm taking you out.

1734
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,548
- Are you stupid?
- Calm him down!

1735
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,749
- He's done. Best man won.
- No, you're beating a guy with one eye.

1736
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,311
- That's all.
- What do you mean?

1737
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,985
Your eye's almost swollen shut.

1738
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:14,950
Didn't work anyway.
At least you don't have to cut me.

1739
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,547
- You don't listen to a thing I say, do you?
- Not this time. He's hurting too. He is.

1740
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,465
Sharp's right eye
is badly swollen...

1741
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,304
...fighting half blind.

1742
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,907
Every time you come from the left, you
knock the snot out of him. He can't see it.

1743
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,630
- That's bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

1744
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,305
- How do you know?
- Mom told me.

1745
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,707
What do you think? She made it up?
That's the way it is.

1746
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,510
It don't matter.
I'm kicking his ass.

1747
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,981
What are you gonna do that for?
You attack his blind eye.

1748
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:39,220
Everyone's gonna say
you didn't beat him at his best.

1749
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,508
You're not gonna be
able to sleep at night!

1750
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,708
Screw that.
I'm taking what's coming to me.

1751
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,670
Kid, do this right. Stand in
front where he can see you!

1752
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,351
Go knock him out!
Now, hurry up! I gotta pee.

1753
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,107
Box!

1754
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:56,991
<i>Final round! Too close to call!</i>

1755
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,820
<i>So many times in a
three-fight rivalry...</i>

1756
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:04,267
<i>...the rubber match is the best.</i>

1757
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,345
<i>- Kid on the attack.</i>
- No!

1758
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,421
Oh!

1759
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,826
What a pounding!

1760
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:12,941
Lightning!

1761
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,030
<i>Sharp is in trouble.</i>

1762
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,510
<i>Razor backpedals woozily.</i>

1763
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,027
<i>And down goes Razor.</i>

1764
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,180
<i>- Sharp was hurt by that punch.</i>
- It's your fight!

1765
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,866
You wanna keep going?

1766
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,702
Yeah. You bet your ass.

1767
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,741
Hey, you can't do that!

1768
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,061
I just did. Come on.

1769
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,705
<i>Kid lifted Razor off the canvas.</i>

1770
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,345
What's he doing?

1771
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,583
Unbelievable! In all my years of
covering boxing, I've never seen it.

1772
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,105
- I told him to do that!
- Oh!

1773
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,103
That's my idea!
I told him to do that!

1774
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,101
<i>Now, Pat Russell
is gonna confer with the judges.</i>

1775
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,271
Give me those gloves.

1776
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,900
And now the ref, in good
sportsmanship, is gonna wave them on.

1777
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,866
I'm right in front of you.
No excuses.

1778
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,707
No excuses.

1779
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,940
<i>They touch gloves one last time.</i>

1780
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:47,466
Now Kid has stopped ducking
and going to Sharp's left.

1781
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,227
He's playing right into Sharp's strength.
Almost like he's challenging him.

1782
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,668
Nail him! Now!

1783
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,381
- That's it!
<i>- Kid attacking with the left hook!</i>

1784
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,780
<i>Sharp is in trouble.</i>

1785
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:05,226
The fighters exchange a flurry.
Brutal stuff. Finally, toe-to-toe!

1786
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,904
<i>Fifteen seconds left.</i>

1787
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,586
<i>Oh, there's a massive
right hand by Razor...</i>

1788
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,504
...and Kid is on the canvas.
He is down!

1789
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,310
Yeah, yeah!

1790
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,663
<i>Kid is not getting up.</i>

1791
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,345
<i>This fight could be over!</i>

1792
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,343
Hey, Kid. <i>No mas?</i>

1793
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,625
<i>Razor pulls Kid up
before the count of 10.</i>

1794
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,430
Oh, for God's sakes.

1795
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,301
I might actually cry now.

1796
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,663
Oh, shit, I'm cry...
It's coming down a little bit.

1797
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,662
- I didn't need your help.
- Right.

1798
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,306
Are you okay, Kid?

1799
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,380
Not really.

1800
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,906
I'm dying, but I've
never felt better.

1801
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,347
Heh. Hey, you did the right thing.

1802
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:34,740
Thanks, son.

1803
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,386
I love you, Dad.

1804
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,947
Well, I'll never call
you a pussy again.

1805
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,148
- Stupid, that's what I'll call you.
- Heh.

1806
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,746
- I am so proud of you!
- Oh, yeah.

1807
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,061
I told you it'd be okay.

1808
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:54,908
Ladies and gentlemen,
we go to the scorecards.

1809
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:00,430
Judge Alfredo Padillo
scores it 92-91 for Sharp.

1810
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:04,505
Judge James Caballa
scores it 90 to 89...

1811
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,583
...for McDonnen.

1812
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,791
And Judge Marco
Rosario scores it...

1813
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,386
...91 to 89...

1814
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:15,783
...to the winner by
split decision...

1815
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:20,343
...Henry "Razor" Sharp!

1816
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,507
Sorry you lost, Kid.

1817
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,071
No. He didn't lose nothing.

1818
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,222
Trey, call me Grandpa.

1819
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,229
Guess it was a mistake,
picking me up.

1820
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,870
No, I wanted you at your best.

1821
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,471
Well, you got it.

1822
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:49,388
- Thanks for the shot.
- Anytime.

1823
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,785
But I still hate you.

1824
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,749
I hate you too.

1825
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,381
Wanna do this again?

1826
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,308
- Definitely not.
- You sure?

1827
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,827
Yeah.

1828
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,029
Bullshit! Fix!

1829
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,944
- Who paid off those judges?
- Light!

1830
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,626
- What?
- Light! We won.

1831
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,066
Who did? What?

1832
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,267
We won.

1833
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,940
- We won? Get the hell out of here!
- Heh, no.

1834
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,465
- Goddamn hearing aid.
- Yeah.

1835
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,145
See? This is why I don't do TV.
I'm going to Sally's.

1836
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,109
Sit down.
There's gonna be a big finish.

1837
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:38,231
<i>I wanna know if you're with me</i>

1838
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:40,621
<i>Can't stand stickin' around</i>

1839
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,111
<i>Hey!</i>

1840
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,667
- Now I wish I was blind in both eyes.
- Oh, wow.

1841
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,701
See you.

1842
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,861
- He has a certain elegance, doesn't he?
- Yeah, a little bit. A little bit.

1843
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,900
I guarantee you, he's gonna
get some snapper tonight.

1844
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,388
Dude, you're a pervert. Like, it
goes right to sex with you. I'm done.

1845
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:10,908
Give me a towel so I can get this
vinegar off my feet. It's strong!

1846
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,425
Why is it that strong?

1847
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,026
It might be bad. I think
the vinegar might be bad.

1848
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:25,108
Listen. If you thought Grudgement Day
was big, then this is gonna be huge.

1849
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,343
They're talking Wembley Stadium for
the rematch. Ninety thousand people.

1850
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,588
I can get you seven figures,
maybe eight.

1851
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,584
Bottom line is I can get you
guys paid. What do you say?

1852
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:36,061
- I'm in.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1853
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,427
- What about you, Evander?
- No.

1854
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,027
Come on, Evander! So the man went
a little batshit and bit your ear off.

1855
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:45,064
- It's not like he liked the way you tasted.
- Taste like ass.

1856
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,109
Did you hear?
You didn't taste good.

1857
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,262
Mike, do me a favor?
Tell him you're sorry.

1858
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,661
- I'm sorry.
- Mike, like you mean it.

1859
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,711
- Sorry.
- I felt that.

1860
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,664
- Come on, Evander. What do you say?
- No.

1861
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,506
- I get you one month at the Playboy Mansion.
- No.

1862
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,271
- Okay, final offer. I'll throw in a Bentley.
- No.

1863
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:10,387
- I'll get you a part in Hangover IV.
- I'm listening.

1864
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,264
- You son of a bitch.
- Now hold on!

1865
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,950
- Guard your ears.
- Wait, Mike! No!
