1
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Shh...

2
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,192
Go back to sleep.

3
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,717
<i>Once upon a time,
before I came,</i>

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,837
<i>you cried and cried</i>

5
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,912
<i>and watched TV all day,</i>

6
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,920
<i>until you were a zombie,</i>

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,480
<i>but then I zoomed down
from heaven</i>

8
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,914
<i>through Skylight</i>

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,071
<i>into Room.</i>

10
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,880
<i>Whoosh-pshew!</i>

11
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,236
<i>And I was kicking you
from the inside.</i>

12
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,755
<i>Boom, boom!</i>

13
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,800
<i>And then I shot out onto Rug
with my eyes wide open,</i>

14
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,636
<i>and you cutt-ed the cord
and said, "Hello, Jack."</i>

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,478
Ma, I'm five!

16
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,560
- You are.
- I'm so old now.

17
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,234
You're such a big boy now.

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,152
Yeah.

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,119
Good morning, lamp.

20
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,639
Good morning, plant.

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,952
Good morning, Eggsnake.

22
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,554
Good morning, rug.

23
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,195
Good morning, wardrobe.

24
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,273
Good morning, TV.

25
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,555
Good morning, sink.

26
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,916
Morning, toilet.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,719
Morning, everyone.

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Okay.

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,920
It's my birthday.
I'm five.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I get it.

31
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,274
Take your vitamin.
It's the last one.

32
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,680
Vitamins.

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,514
- Is bad tooth hurting?
- Mm-hmm.

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,954
But you know,

35
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,396
mind over matter.

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,995
If you don't mind,
it doesn't matter.

37
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,469
You're right.

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,194
Hey, do you know

39
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,396
what we're gonna do today?

40
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,199
What?

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,239
We are going to bake
a birthday cake.

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,640
A birthday cake?

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,392
Mm-hmm.

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,354
- Like in TV?
- Mm-hmm, but for real.

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
No way!

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,473
The back.

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,599
Now go, one, two, three.

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,037
Four, five.
One, two, three, four, five--

49
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
There you are.

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,680
<i>I love you.</i>

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,755
Okay, TV off.

52
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,914
I'm gonna grow and grow
until I'm a giant.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,832
Look, Ma, I'm strong as Samson.

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,479
Yeah. You are.

55
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,870
I'm going to be
Jack the Giant, Giant-Killer

56
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,758
and burst out of Skylight
into space

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,035
with my dog, Lucky,

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,274
and boing, boing, boing
to all of the planets.

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,113
Let's start with some stretch.

60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,035
Great job. Great job.

61
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,553
Other leg, quickly.

62
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,111
Switch legs. Hup.

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,360
- Yeah.
- I'm doing it.

64
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,319
- Yeah.
- I'm doing...

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,120
jump, jump...

66
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,270
like a frog.

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,558
Feet back
and then do a push-up down.

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,837
Up. Okay, time for track.

69
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,149
Now this wall.

70
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,913
Oh, I meant this wall.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,150
Did I say this wall?

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,674
I meant this wall,

73
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,080
but I actually meant,
I meant this wall,

74
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,753
and this one,

75
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,399
but this one needs it, too.

76
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,038
Yeah!

77
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,152
Mm.

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,471
Oh, it's
a beautiful egg.

79
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,040
Pretty good.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,270
Is that the batter?

81
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
That's the batter.

82
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,396
We're gonna add
some butter, too.

83
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,630
How about that?

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,359
- Butter!
- Urgh!

85
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,830
- Ho, ho!
- Oh, yeah, mash that in.

86
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,680
Well, we got it!

87
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,592
Why don't you do some of that?

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,240
- Can you... handle that?
- Yeah.

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,478
Abracadabra!

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,593
Now the candles!

91
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,114
We don't have any candles.

92
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,351
I know.

93
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,716
You said a birthday cake,
for real.

94
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,156
That means candles on fire.

95
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,120
Jack...

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,720
it's okay
without the candles.

97
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,917
It's still a birthday cake.

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,598
You should ask for candles
for a Sunday Treat,

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,115
not dumb jeans.

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,558
You know, I have to ask
for stuff that we really need,

102
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,359
stuff that he can get easily.

103
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,796
But Old Nick gets anything,
by magic.

104
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,440
Why don't we try your cake?

105
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,637
No!

106
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,029
Jack.

107
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,720
Let's try a bite of it.

108
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,354
I said, no!

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,829
Come here.

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,877
Next week when I'm six,

111
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,838
you'd better ask
for real candles.

112
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,393
Next year, you mean.

113
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,399
<i>And Edmond tears free
out of the bag,</i>

114
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,110
<i>and swims and swims
to the island of Monte Cristo,</i>

115
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,232
<i>and he digs up the treasure</i>

116
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,359
<i>his friend
was telling him about.</i>

117
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,116
<i>He buys a big yacht...</i>

118
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,557
<i>and sails back to France,</i>

119
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,869
<i>and when he gets there,</i>

120
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,792
<i>he decides to buy the island,</i>

121
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,998
<i>and call himself "The Count,"</i>

122
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,673
and vows to take revenge

123
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,991
on all of the people
that were mean to him.

124
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,032
Can we have more birthday cake?

125
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Tomorrow.

126
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,120
Just a bite?

127
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,594
We brushed our teeth already.

128
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,717
One last story?
Please.

129
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,677
Come on, Jack.
It's late.

130
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,399
Let's go to bed.

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,070
...47, 48, 49.

169
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,914
50, 51...

170
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,553
Shh...

171
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,039
Oh.

172
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,638
What is it?

173
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,519
It's a bad tooth.

174
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,078
Mm-hmm.

175
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,714
Can I hold it?

176
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,875
Wow!

177
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,152
You made him gone!

178
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,595
He was an alive thing.

179
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,956
He was real!

180
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,112
He would have stolen our food.

181
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,600
Mouse can have my food.

182
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,114
I'm not hungry.

183
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,193
He would have brought in germs,
bit us in our sleep.

184
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,834
Mouse is my friend,

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,673
and you splattered him dead.

186
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
No, I didn't.

187
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,400
He's hunky-dory.

188
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,233
Are you tricking me?

189
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,073
No, Jack, I swear.

190
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,438
He is safe at home
in the backyard with his Ma.

191
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,799
What backyard?

192
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,435
Mouse lives in a yard in TV?

193
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,638
Here, why don't you make a UFO
out of this?

194
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,114
Why you didn't tell Old Nick
it was my birthday?

195
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,198
Because he's not our friend.

196
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,640
He said he'd bring me a present.

197
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,120
You're not supposed
to be listening to that.

198
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,475
You're supposed to be asleep.

199
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,199
I never had a present.

200
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,954
Well, he didn't mean it.

201
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,398
It might be my dog, Lucky.

202
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,880
Jack, we can't have a dog.

203
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,240
There's not enough room--
space--

204
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,316
there's not enough space,

205
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,880
with the barking
and the scratching.

206
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,235
Lucky won't scratch.

207
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
He promises.

208
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,550
There is no Lucky!

209
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,154
Yes, there is!

210
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,118
No, there's not.

211
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,320
You made him up
in your head.

212
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,392
He's not real.

213
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,230
Jack, I'm sorry.

214
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,517
Come here, come here, come here.
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,917
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,310
You're right.
That wasn't nice.

217
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,759
Where do we go
when we're asleep?

218
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,792
Right here in Room.

219
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,515
But dreams--

220
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,197
do we go to,
into TV for dreaming?

221
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,634
Mm-mm.

222
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,473
We're never anywhere
but here.

223
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,554
Can I open it?

224
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Mm-hmm.

225
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,434
Yes!

226
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,558
Why the aliens
never scream back?

227
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,474
I guess
they still can't hear us.

228
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,438
We'll do it even louder, okay?

229
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Okay.

230
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,234
I'll kill you!

231
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,358
Would you like to kill me now?

232
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,392
Ma, he's attacking me!

233
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,755
Oh, no!

234
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,076
Got you. Ow!

235
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,560
Ow!

236
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,239
Ma, what smells bad?

237
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,632
Fuck.

238
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,519
Ugh.

239
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,237
Shh...

240
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,674
What's that smell?

241
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,752
Sorry, I burned some cheese.

242
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,231
- Here.
- I just wasn't thinking.

243
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,040
Well, thinking
is not your strong suit.

244
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,872
I know.

245
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,478
Yeah.

246
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,110
Why don't you sit down?

247
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,358
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

248
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,437
So how did he
like his truck?

249
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,434
Yeah?

250
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,916
Yeah.

251
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,319
I know boys.

252
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,439
The vitamins.

253
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,557
Ah, it's a waste
of money.

254
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,394
There's nothing in them.

255
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,516
Well, if we had a better diet.

256
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,398
Oh, fuck,
here we go again.

257
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,631
Maybe if you could
stop complaining

258
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,240
and be a little grateful.

259
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,275
Thank you.

260
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,795
God, it's fucking
pulling teeth sometimes.

261
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,791
Thank you for everything.

262
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,719
You just have no idea
about the world of today.

263
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,235
- No.
- No.

264
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,800
Who pays the power bill?

265
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,200
Who pays for everything?

266
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,396
- You.
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
And how do you think

268
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,518
I'm gonna be able
to keep doing that?

269
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,512
What do you mean?

270
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,120
Nothing.

271
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,231
No, but what
does that mean?

272
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,232
Six months.
I've been laid off.

273
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,073
Six months.

274
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,230
Yeah.

275
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,152
If you had to worry
your little head--

276
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,118
What are you gonna do about it?

277
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,355
Are you looking for a job?

278
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,830
There are no fucking jobs!

279
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,514
Jesus.

280
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Hey there.

281
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,952
He's asleep.

282
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,713
I don't think so.

283
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,718
Do you keep him in the closet
all day as well as all night?

284
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,870
What, does the little freak
got two heads or something?

285
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,877
Hey.

286
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,794
- Hey.
- Shh.

287
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,674
- Come to bed.
- Hey, Jack.

288
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,751
- Hey.
- Let's go to bed.

289
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,797
You want some candy?

290
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,031
Do you like candy, huh?

291
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,598
Come on out and get some candy.

292
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,717
Come to bed.

293
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,393
Please?

294
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,234
Please?

295
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,237
Didn't your momma ever teach you
any manners, young lady?

296
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,796
Oh, hey sonny.

297
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,553
Get away from him!

298
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,916
Don't touch him!
Don't touch him!

299
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,639
Fuck!

300
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,631
Don't touch him!

301
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,234
Quit the noise!

302
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,835
Quit the noise.
Quit the noise.

303
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,115
Do you want to breathe?

304
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Yeah?

305
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,754
Do you want to breathe?

306
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,195
Then shut the fuck up.

307
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,550
God!

308
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Fuck.

309
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,313
Don't touch him.

310
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,716
Fuck.

311
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,358
If you ever
touch me like that again,

312
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,113
if you grab me like that,

313
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,236
I'll fucking kill you.

314
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,073
- Do you understand that?
- Don't touch him.

315
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,677
Yeah. Don't you forget
where you got him.

316
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,040
Jack? Jack?

317
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,354
I'm sorry!

318
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,838
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

319
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,275
- It's okay.
- I won't do it again.

320
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Hmm?

321
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,434
Hmm.

322
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,556
Ma, I'm a dragon.

323
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,839
I'm a dragon.

324
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,120
He cut the power.

325
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
"For, you see,

326
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,878
so many out-of-the-way things
had happened lat-ely, that--"

327
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,076
- Lately.
- Lately.

328
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,391
"...That Alice
had begun to think

329
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,512
"that very few things, indeed,

330
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,035
"were really impossible.

331
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,832
There seemed to be no use
in waiting by the little door."

332
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,995
Ma?

333
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,199
Hey, Jack,
do you remember Mouse?

334
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Yeah.

335
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Yeah?

336
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,396
You know where he is?

337
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,917
Hmm.

338
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,639
I do.

339
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,398
He's on the other side
of this wall.

340
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,512
What other side?

341
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,069
Jack, there's two sides
to everything.

342
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,509
Not on an octagon.

343
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,557
Yeah, but--

344
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,233
An octagon has eight sides.

345
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,950
But a wall, okay,
a wall's like this, see?

346
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,110
And we're on the inside

347
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,192
and Mouse is on the outside.

348
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,999
In Outer Space?

349
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,355
No, in the world.

350
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,160
It's much closer
than Outer Space.

351
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,233
I can't see the outside-side.

352
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,232
Listen, I know that I told you
something else before,

353
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,039
but you were much younger.

354
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,190
I didn't think
that you could understand,

355
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,351
but now you're so old,
you're so smart.

356
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,870
I know that you can get this.

357
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,029
Where do you think
that Old Nick gets our food?

358
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,515
From TV by magic.

359
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,717
There is no magic.

360
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,476
What you see on TV,

361
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,914
those are pictures
of real things,

362
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,354
of real people.

363
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,159
It's real stuff.

364
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,599
Dora's real, for real?

365
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,911
No, that's a drawing.

366
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,952
Dora is a drawing.

367
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,032
But other people,

368
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,351
they have faces like us.

369
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,477
Those are pictures
of real things,

370
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,676
and all the other stuff
you see on there,

371
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,598
that's real, too.

372
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,520
That's real oceans, real trees,
real cats, dogs.

373
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,398
No way.

374
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,875
Where would they all fit?

375
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,753
They just do.
They just fit.

376
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,640
They just fit
out in the world.

377
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,711
Jack, come on, you're so smart.

378
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,031
I know that you've been
wondering about this.

379
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,635
Can I have something else
to eat?

380
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,991
There's a leaf.
Do you see that?

381
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,156
Where?

382
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,755
- Look.
- I don't see a leaf.

383
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,674
Come here.
I want you to see.

384
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,350
You can have a closer look.

385
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
You see that?

386
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,472
See?

387
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,915
Dumbo Ma.

388
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,310
That's not a leaf.
Leaves are green.

389
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Yeah, on trees,

390
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,357
but then they fall,
and they rot,

391
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,760
like salad
in the fridge.

392
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,593
Where's all the stuff
you said?

393
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,117
Trees, and dogs,
and cats, and grass?

394
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,520
We can't see it from here

395
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
because Skylight looks upwards
instead of sideways.

396
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,557
You're just tricking me.

397
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,994
No, I'm not.

398
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,470
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

399
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,994
Jack.

400
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,594
I couldn't explain it before,
because you were too small.

401
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,716
You were too small
to understand,

402
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,235
so I had to make up a story,
but--

403
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,993
but now I'm doing the opposite,
okay?

404
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,190
I'm doing the opposite of lying.

405
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,033
I am un-lying,
because you're five now.

406
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,635
You're five,

407
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,392
and you're old enough

408
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,591
to understand
what the world is.

409
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,440
You have to understand.

410
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,636
We can't keep living like this.

411
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
You need to help me.

412
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,270
I want to be four again.

413
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,040
Do you remember how...

414
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,279
do you remember how Alice
wasn't always in Wonderland?

415
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,791
She fell down, down, down,
deep in a hole.

416
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,519
Right, well,
I wasn't always in Room.

417
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,716
I'm like Alice.

418
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,359
I was a little girl
named Joy.

419
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,635
Nah!

420
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,275
And I lived in a house
with my mom and my dad.

421
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,352
You would call them
Grandma and Grandpa.

422
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,954
What house?

423
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,197
A house.
It was in the world.

424
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
And there was a backyard,

425
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,640
and we had a hammock,

426
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,836
and we would swing
in the hammock,

427
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,791
and we would eat
ice cream.

428
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,593
A TV house?

429
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,875
No, Jack,
a real house,

430
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,474
not TV.

431
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,677
Are you even listening to me?

432
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,077
When I was a little older,

433
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,470
when I was 17--

434
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,960
- I was walking home from school-
- Where was I?

435
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,917
You were still up in heaven.

436
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,036
But there was a guy.

437
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,871
He pretended that
his dog was sick.

438
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,871
What guy?

439
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,110
Old Nick.

440
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
We call him "Old Nick."

441
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,960
I don't know
what his real name is.

442
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,400
But he pretended
his dog was sick--

443
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,399
- What's the dog's name?
- Jack, there wasn't a dog.

444
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,235
He was trying to trick me, okay?

445
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,709
There wasn't a dog.
Old Nick stole me.

446
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,632
I want a different story!

447
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,110
No! This is the story
that you get.

448
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,155
He put me
in his garden shed.

449
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,718
Here.

450
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,156
Room is the shed.

451
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,879
He's locked the door.

452
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,917
He's the only one
that knows the code--

453
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,150
you know, the secret numbers
that open the door?

454
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,720
He's the only one that knows,

455
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,792
and I've been locked in here
for seven years.

456
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,109
I've been in here
for seven years.

457
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,395
Do you understand?

458
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,960
This story's boring!

459
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,159
Jack, the world is so big.

460
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,720
It's so big,
you wouldn't even believe it.

461
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,554
And Room is just
one stinky part of it.

462
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,040
Room's not stinky.

463
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,873
Only when you do a fart.

464
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,753
My God. Okay.

465
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,197
I don't believe
in your stinky world!

466
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,238
It's warm again.

467
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,954
Ma.

468
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,159
Ma.

469
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,592
- Ma?
- Hmm.

470
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,271
<i>Eggsnake's our longest friend</i>

471
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,880
<i>and fanciest.</i>

472
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,552
<i>Meltedy Spoon's
the best to eat with</i>

473
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,472
<i>because he's more blobbier.</i>

474
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,916
<i>Labyrinth is the twistiest</i>

475
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,640
<i>and she hides things
so I don't know where they are.</i>

476
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,191
<i>Toilet's the best
at disappearing poo.</i>

477
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,393
<i>Lamp's the brightest,</i>

478
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,359
<i>except when the power's cut.</i>

479
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,636
<i>You're the best at reading
and songs and lots,</i>

480
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,157
<i>except if you're having
a Gone Day.</i>

481
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,955
<i>I'm the best at drawing,
and jumping, and growing,</i>

482
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,640
<i>and nearly everything!</i>

483
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,433
Are turtles real?

484
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,034
Yeah. They're totally real.

485
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,157
I had a turtle as a pet.

486
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,837
Crocodiles and sharks?

487
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,559
Yeah, they're all real.

488
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,150
Real?

489
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,600
Sort of.

490
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,392
So, these are real people,
but they're playing dress-up.

491
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,709
They're pretending

492
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,600
that they're people
from hundreds of years ago.

493
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,197
Just TV?

494
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,793
You're getting it.

495
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,720
When Old Nick comes back,

496
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,519
I'm gonna kick him in the butt.

497
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,276
Let me tell you something.

498
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,555
You know, one time,

499
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,110
I tried to kick Old Nick
in the butt.

500
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,192
I hid behind the door,

501
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,040
and I was holding the lid
from the toilet tank.

502
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,316
There used to be a lid on it.

503
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,232
It was the heaviest thing
in Room.

504
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,595
When he came in,

505
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,399
I smashed it on his head,

506
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,439
but I messed up.

507
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,673
He shoved the door closed,
and he grabbed me by the wrist.

508
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,798
That's why it's sore now.

509
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,950
We could wait
'til he's asleep

510
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,951
and kill him dead.

511
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,236
Yeah, we could, but...

512
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,516
then what?

513
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,359
We'd run out of food

514
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,159
and we don't know the code
to the door.

515
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,676
Hey, the Grandma and the Grandpa
could come.

516
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,837
Jack, they don't know
where we are.

517
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,674
Room's not on any map.

518
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,471
Jack, listen to me.

519
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,432
Now, we've got a chance.

520
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,917
We've nearly missed it,
but we've got our chance.

521
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,474
So you're gonna help me.

522
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,077
You're gonna help me
trick Old Nick.

523
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,909
I don't get it.

524
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,878
I'm going to make
your face so hot,

525
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,360
that Old Nick will have to
take you to the hospital

526
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
in his truck,

527
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,709
and then when you get there,

528
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,917
you're gonna say to the doctors,
"Help! Police!"

529
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,152
Well, maybe next year
when I'm six.

530
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,390
Tonight.

531
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,479
It has to be tonight, Jack.

532
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,798
We'll tell Old Nick
that because of the power cut,

533
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,360
you got so cold,
that you got a fever.

534
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,999
Tomorrow, please.

535
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,400
No. I'm your Ma,

536
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,120
so, sometimes, I have to pick
for the both of us.

537
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Ow!

538
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,674
It's okay.
It's okay.

539
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,591
You've got
to stay floppy.

540
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,796
Okay?

541
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,030
Stay floppy,

542
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,475
and you're not going to move
or say a word.

543
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,040
You're too weak, okay?

544
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,591
Ew, what are you doing?

545
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
What are you doing?

546
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,396
Sorry.

547
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,870
I've just got to make you
smell sick.

548
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,553
Good. That's good.

549
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,194
Show me how--

550
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,475
Show you me how

551
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,397
you're gonna pull the note
out of your pocket.

552
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,397
Show me the note.
Come on.

553
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,351
When you're at the hospital...

554
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,871
Show me.
What's this?

555
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,156
What's that? Oh.

556
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,949
You see? You've got a bit of me
all the time.

557
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,875
Okay. Put it
back in your pocket.

558
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
Okay, good.

559
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,553
Okay.

560
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,154
And you've got your strong, too.

561
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,276
Okay?

562
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,039
I'm scared.

563
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,594
I know.

564
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,509
Come on.

565
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,239
It's okay.

566
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
There you are.

567
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,311
You know the drill.

568
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,959
Not a peep 'til the door's shut.

569
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
Sorry. It's--

570
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,679
Jack's sick.

571
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,592
It was so cold.

572
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,509
Well, you brought
that on yourself.

573
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,716
Well, I couldn't
keep him warm,

574
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,712
and now he's burning up.

575
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,598
Give him some of
those painkillers.

576
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,720
I tried, but he just keeps
puking them back up.

577
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,480
Don't. Don't!

578
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,114
Stay still.

579
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,836
Jesus, he's on fire.

580
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,278
Okay, well I'll get him
something stronger.

581
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,510
But he--he's five.

582
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
He's dehydrated.

583
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,915
He has a fever.

584
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,070
He could go into convulsions
at any minute.

585
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,913
Just shut up
and let me think!

586
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,310
Okay. All right. Okay.

587
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,760
I'll-- I'll get him some
tomorrow night.

588
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,513
No! He-- you need to take him
to the E.R. right now.

589
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,954
Stop the hysterics.

590
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,679
Please, I'm begging you!

591
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,793
Am I still gonna go?

592
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,673
No, not this time.

593
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,559
It's okay.

594
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,917
<i>So you remember how Edmond</i>

595
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,631
<i>pulls his friend out of a bag
and hides him,</i>

596
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,110
<i>and then he gets in the bag,</i>

597
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,480
<i>and he lays in there
really still</i>

598
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,477
<i>until the guards come?</i>

599
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,399
<i>So that's
what you're going to do.</i>

600
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,960
You see?

601
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,271
How that's even tricks-ier
than pretending to be sick,

602
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,477
because you're gonna...

603
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,153
play dead.

604
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,279
Folding over.

605
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,518
I don't want to be dead.

606
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,916
You're just
pretending to be dead.

607
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,639
Stay stiff.

608
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,679
We're gonna roll you up in Rug
so that Old Nick won't see you,

609
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,029
won't see
that you're alive inside.

610
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,351
Old Nick's
going to pick you up like this.

611
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,113
Stay stiff, stiff, stiff.

612
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,759
<i>And, and you're not gonna be
wobbly and floppy this time.</i>

613
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,117
<i>You're gonna be real stiff,
like a--like a robot.</i>

614
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,356
It's gonna shake.

615
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,279
Now, that is what
it'll feel like.

616
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,875
And that's when you know
that Old Nick's driving.

617
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,280
That means he's busy,

618
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,595
and so it's time
for you to roll.

619
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,797
<i>And you're not gonna
make a sound,</i>

620
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,075
<i>and I'm gonna be there
in your head,</i>

621
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,480
<i>talking to you the whole time.</i>

622
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,153
Come on.
Roll, roll, roll.

623
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,991
Now, wiggle,
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

624
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,275
Get yourself out.

625
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,589
I can't. Stop!

626
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,558
- Come on, Jack.
- Ma, I can't!

627
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,120
<i>And Old Nick's gonna come,</i>

628
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,680
<i>and he's gonna pick you up
in the rug,</i>

629
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,035
<i>and he's gonna
take you outside,</i>

630
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,760
<i>and he's gonna put you
in his truck,</i>

631
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,317
<i>and he's gonna...</i>

632
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,438
<i>find a place to--
to lay you down.</i>

633
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,953
No.

634
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,716
<i>It'll be okay, though,</i>

635
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,757
because you're gonna wiggle out,

636
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,880
<i>and you're gonna run away.</i>

637
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,559
Head over here.

638
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,080
Arms like this.

639
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,640
Okay, there was
too many turns that time.

640
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,870
I'll shorten the rug.

641
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,951
Okay.

642
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,110
Ooh.

643
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,033
Roll, roll, roll!

644
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,349
Roll, Jack, roll, come on!

645
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,794
Roll.

646
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,195
You've got it. Now wiggle,
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

647
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,749
- Yes!
- I hate you!

648
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,952
Okay, okay.

649
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,719
Truck, wiggle out, jump, run.

650
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,678
Okay, you'll jump,

651
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,638
jump when you hit
the first stop sign,

652
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,439
and the truck
rolls to a stop.

653
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,280
And you're gonna shout
when you see somebody.

654
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,320
You say, "My Ma is Joy Newsome."

655
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Who's Somebody?

656
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,951
Anybody. It's the first person
that you see.

657
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,080
An actual

658
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,395
real-life person?

659
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,392
Mm-hmm.

660
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,312
What if Old Nick unwraps me?

661
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,920
He won't.

662
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,516
You got Bad Tooth?

663
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,513
He's in here
so I don't lose him.

664
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,119
You are amazing.

665
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,152
And you're going to love it.

666
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,509
What?

667
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,435
The world.

668
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,955
My house with the hammock

669
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,277
and Grandma and Grandpa.

670
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,235
And you?

671
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,114
Yeah.

672
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,600
Stay stiff.
I'm sorry, Jack.

673
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,000
Stay stiff.

674
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,277
You can do this.

675
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,750
Antibiotics.

676
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,956
What are you doing?

677
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,357
He got worse in the night.

678
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,756
He didn't wake up.

679
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,913
Oh, jeez.

680
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,912
You poor girl.

681
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,598
Well, I guess it must have been
pretty serious.

682
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,115
You killed my baby.

683
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,350
Okay, take it easy.

684
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,311
Okay, let me have a look.

685
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,670
Don't touch him!

686
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,916
Okay.

687
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,790
Are you sure?

688
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,714
Am I sure?

689
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,193
Okay. Well, he can't stay here,
you know?

690
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,634
No.

691
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,000
Where are you gonna take him?

692
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,672
I don't know.

693
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,798
I, I'm thinking. Um...

694
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,559
Somewhere nice.

695
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,074
It can't be here.

696
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,197
I'll feel him.

697
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,316
Okay.

698
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,238
Somewhere with trees.

699
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,676
Trees, sure, yeah.

700
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,479
I want to swear to me

701
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,270
you won't even
lay your filthy eyes on him.

702
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,671
Swear to me that
you won't look at him!

703
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,519
I swear.

704
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,833
Okay, well, it's about
an hour until dark.

705
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,080
Now!

706
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,675
I can't bear it.

707
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,912
Okay, all right, all right.

708
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,476
Gentle, please!

709
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,400
Okay. Okay.

710
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,192
Please!
Please, please, be gentle.

711
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,680
I got him now! I got him.
I got him.

712
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,400
Step back.

713
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,591
Face the wall.

714
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,910
<i>Truck.</i>

715
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,559
<i>Wiggle out.</i>

716
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,997
<i>Jump, run, somebody.</i>

717
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,359
God. Stupid bitch.

718
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,679
Oh! Boomer!

719
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,638
I'm really sorry, man.
She just came out of nowhere.

720
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,111
I'm-- hey, hey,
I'm really sorry.

721
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,680
Is your little girl okay?

722
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,796
It's under control.

723
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,996
Okay.

724
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,719
Has she been in
some kind of accident?

725
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,039
Would you like me
to phone someone?

726
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,919
Help!

727
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,195
I'll take care of it.

728
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,150
What's that you've
got there, honey?

729
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,435
Come on!

730
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,314
Is that for me?

731
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,357
Come on.

732
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,352
Why don't you just
mind your own business?

733
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,556
Ma!

734
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,120
- I'm calling the cops, Mister--
- Help me!

735
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,316
Fuck!

736
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,039
Hey, whoa, hey, hey!

737
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,079
Come here. Sit.
Sit down.

738
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,798
Hi, honey.

739
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,951
This is Boomer.
He's not gonna hurt you.

740
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,152
He's all gone now.
I'm gonna call somebody.

741
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It was a red pick-up.

742
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,957
She was running away
from this guy.

743
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,235
He grabbed
her.

744
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,152
- I tried to stop him and--
- Thank you.

745
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,596
Hey. Hey, there.

746
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,592
I'm Officer Parker.
Can you tell me your name?

747
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,033
Hi.

748
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,554
Jack.

749
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,791
Can you say that
a little louder for me?

750
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,271
Okay.

751
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,991
So, um, do you...

752
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,719
have another name?

753
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,756
Jack?

754
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,080
Okay, it's okay.

755
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,392
Can you tell me how old you are?

756
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,915
I'm five.

757
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,560
Five?

758
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,632
That's great, okay.

759
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,032
Now, uh, can you tell me
where you live?

760
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,880
Why don't
we call Child Services?

761
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,752
Do you have a mom, Jack?

762
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,396
Ma.

763
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,039
Okay, good.

764
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,760
Does she have another name?

765
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,273
I can't remember.

766
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,834
Um, where's Ma right now?

767
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,280
- Room.
- What room?

768
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,952
Jack, where's this room?

769
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,080
That guy with the truck,
is that your dad?

770
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,591
Is that Ma's boyfriend?
Do you know him?

771
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,559
What's that, Jack?

772
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,555
A bit of Ma.

773
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
That's okay, buddy.

774
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,151
That's good.
Thank you, Jack.

775
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,799
That's good.
You did real good, okay?

776
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,394
You did good.

777
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,992
So Jack,
anything you recognize, buddy?

778
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,719
Jack, anything?

779
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,237
Your room, Jack.

780
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,630
What's outside the room?

781
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,273
Space.

782
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,159
No--the world.

783
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,197
You think
the kid's on something?

784
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,355
Okay, listen,
when you step out the door...

785
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,910
No? No, you don't?

786
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,151
We don't know
how to open the door.

787
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,560
My money's
on some kind of cult--

788
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,438
the tooth, the long hair.

789
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,716
Is there daylight in your room?

790
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,794
Okay, good.
How many windows?

791
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,274
Zero.

792
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,352
Well, then,
how does the sun come in?

793
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,635
Through Skylight.

794
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,074
Skylight?

795
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,196
Okay, excellent.

796
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,920
So you live in a house
with a skylight?

797
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,080
No, it's not a house.

798
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,629
Okay.

799
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,760
- It's a...
- Yeah?

800
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,115
It's a...

801
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,993
Uh, you'd get more out of him
after he's had some sleep.

802
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,080
Tom, give it a second.

803
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,753
Room's a--a shed.

804
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,957
A shed, Jack? A shed?

805
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,040
Okay, good boy.

806
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,440
Yeah, it's a needle
in a haystack.

807
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,520
Okay, listen to me.

808
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,155
What made you jump
out the truck, Jack?

809
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,317
Ma said in my head.

810
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,995
Okay, what exactly
did she say?

811
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,036
Jump when it slows down,
but I couldn't.

812
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,316
All right.
So, what did you do?

813
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,995
What did you do?

814
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,192
Third time, I got bent.

815
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,193
The... third time
of what, Jack?

816
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Third slow.

817
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,080
Everything went sideways,

818
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,833
and then it stopped,
then I jumped...

819
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,957
- I got it.
- ...into...

820
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
I got it, buddy.
I got it.

821
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,112
- 54-09 call.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

822
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,192
Dispatch. Listen carefully.
We have a rough location.

823
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,795
All right, uh, south on Elm,

824
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,837
three stop signs
past the junction with Beech.

825
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,719
Look for a garden shed
with a skylight.

826
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,996
Also check the most recent
satellite images

827
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,594
for a red pick-up
in the driveway.

828
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,433
54-09 on route.

829
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,034
- Unbelievable.
<i>- Okay, copy that, 54-09.</i>

830
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,680
Good boy, Jack.

831
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,798
...<i>A possible
active hostage situation.</i>

832
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,911
<i>27-Adam calling in.</i>

833
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,037
We are at 40019 Pine Street.

834
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,360
Stay with the kid.

835
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,479
Everything's
gonna be okay, Jack.

836
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,996
Settle in.

837
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,437
Hey, Parker, backyard.

838
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,994
Ma!

839
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,672
Ma...

840
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,678
Ma.

841
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,394
Ma!

842
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,918
Open the door! Open!

843
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,990
- Jack! Where is he?
- Ma! Ma, I'm in this one!

844
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,719
Jack!

845
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,955
Ma.

846
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,118
Can we go to bed?

847
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,839
Yeah.

848
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,636
They'll take us somewhere
to sleep soon.

849
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,077
No, but Bed...

850
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,799
in Room.

851
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,551
- Ma! Ma!
- Oh.

852
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,992
Good morning, sleepyhead.

853
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,400
I was waiting
so long for you to wake up,

854
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,711
I fell asleep again.

855
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,154
Are we on another planet?

856
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,754
Mm-mm.

857
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,758
Same one, just a different spot.

858
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,238
This one is...

859
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,271
a bedroom in a hospital.

860
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,353
Are we sick for real or pretend?

861
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,760
We're not sick.

862
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,593
We're the opposite
of sick.

863
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
How long are we staying?

864
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,071
Not long.

865
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,480
Grandma saw us last night,

866
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,394
and she's gonna get us
once they say we're okay.

867
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,039
And Grandpa?

868
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,600
He was away for work,

869
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,070
but he's on a plane
coming back home.

870
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,635
I wetted the bed before.
I'm sorry.

871
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,591
Yeah?

872
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,029
It was by accident.

873
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:10,473
It's okay.

874
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,473
Hello?

875
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,876
Yeah.

876
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,316
Just now.

877
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,750
Uh, yeah, that would be great.

878
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,194
Can you bring it in 20 minutes?

879
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,915
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

880
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,120
Step out, okay.

881
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,560
- Ma that's waste.
- We'll get you new ones.

882
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,632
For Sunday Treat?

883
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,638
There will be
so many treats,

884
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,359
and not just on Sunday.

885
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,273
Ma, where's the bath?

886
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,600
There's a shower.

887
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,194
It's splashier.

888
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,030
Jack, come here.

889
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,600
That's us.

890
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,552
Ma, will he find us?

891
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,557
No.

892
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,154
He will never find us.

893
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,916
Come on.

894
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,913
Bath before bed.
That's the rule.

895
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,352
There are no rules, Jack.

896
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,874
We can do what we like.

897
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,073
Are you hurting?

898
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,073
No.

899
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,160
You wanna come in?

900
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,714
Mm-mm.

901
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,872
Ma, the door's ticking.

902
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,838
Hey, it's okay.

903
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,958
- Good morning.
- Hi.

904
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,713
Hey, it's okay.
Come on.

905
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,600
So I hear
we're all awake now?

906
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,638
Yeah.

907
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,393
Just put it
right there.

908
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,914
It's okay Jack.

909
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,833
Hi, Jack.

910
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,320
How are you doing?

911
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,959
My name's Dr. Mittal,

912
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,236
and you were asleep
when I showed up this morning.

913
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,920
You hungry?

914
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,195
Do you want
some breakfast?

915
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,396
Yeah, you must be starved.

916
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,239
He's gonna bring you
some breakfast.

917
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,159
Check out what we've got.

918
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,516
It's pancakes and fruit.

919
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,229
Mm.

920
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,000
Let's check it out.

921
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,191
Wow! Pancakes.

922
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,352
Looks really good.

923
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,397
Really, really good.

924
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,800
You want to try it?

925
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,439
- It goes with syrup, too.
- Everything's looking good.

926
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,796
You want to try syrup?
It's very sweet.

927
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,436
So...

928
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,432
I brought you some goodies.

929
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,870
Sunglasses.

930
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,996
Okay.

931
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:57,957
That'll make you
more comfortable,

932
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,360
if you need to go outside,

933
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,352
and, um, sunscreen.

934
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,590
That's for him, mainly.

935
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,353
This is important.
That's-that's for Jack.

936
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,880
Is that really necessary?

937
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,555
Well, there's a lot of
germs in the air

938
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,916
that he still needs
to get used to.

939
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,593
And, uh, my colleague

940
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,990
prescribed this
for your pain,

941
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,400
for your wrist,

942
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,153
until they can get you
set up for surgery.

943
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,640
And that's
to help you sleep.

944
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:20,870
Just take it
if you need it.

945
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,235
Okay.

946
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,277
Thank you.

947
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,476
Come on, Jack.

948
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,314
Let's try some pancake, huh?

949
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,550
So, have you had a chance

950
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,120
to think about what we discussed
this morning?

951
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,720
Yeah, I thought--
I did think about it.

952
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,799
Thank you, but...

953
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,156
I-I really want to go home.

954
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,560
Okay.

955
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,597
You know my view.

956
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,751
Yeah.

957
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,038
And with everything
you two have experienced,

958
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,120
and, uh,

959
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,352
just to assess Jack properly.

960
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,119
But nothing happened to Jack.

961
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,320
No, no, no, I understand.

962
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,440
I understand.

963
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,670
He's gonna be
okay, right?

964
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,711
The most important thing you did

965
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,600
was get him out
while he's still plastic.

966
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,790
What?

967
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,075
I'm not plastic.

968
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,913
What's that, Jack?

969
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,229
He says that he's--

970
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,640
he's real.

971
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,552
He's not plastic.

972
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,996
Well, you got me there, Jack.

973
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,080
You're real.

974
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,476
And you're very brave.

975
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,274
Um... Yeah, let's talk
about this later.

976
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,680
Dad?

977
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,797
Dad!

978
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,639
I'm sorry. We just couldn't
wait any longer.

979
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,756
It's okay.

980
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,876
Don't worry about it.

981
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,194
Hello, Jack.

982
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,670
Thanks for saving
our little girl.

983
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:00,713
<i>I've been in the world
37 hours.</i>

984
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,029
<i>I've seen pancakes,</i>

985
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,952
<i>and a stairs,</i>

986

01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,313
<i>But Ma says</i>

994
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,995
<i>they don't live together
in the hammock house anymore.</i>

995
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,832

with her friend, Leo, now,</i>

996
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,310
<i>and Grandpa lives far away.</i>

997
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,880
Sorry. I'm sorry.

998
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,197
<i>I've seen persons
with different faces</i>

999
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,192
<i>and bigness and smells,</i>

1000
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,317
<i>talking all together.</i>

1001
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,834
<i>Now, we are getting
unconfirmed reports</i>

1002
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,274
<i>that an individual
has just been arrested...</i>

1003
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,635
<i>The world's like</i>

1004
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,394
<i>all TV planets
on at the same time...</i>

1005
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,994
Hello?

1006
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,878
<i>...So I don't know which way
to look and listen.</i>

1007
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,960
I just want to come home.

1008
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,714
<i>There's doors and more doors,</i>

1009
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,314
<i>and behind all the doors,</i>

1010
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,471
<i>there's another inside,</i>

1011
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,631
<i>and another outside,</i>

1012
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,360
<i>and things happen,
happen, happening.</i>

1013
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,238
<i>It never stops.</i>

1014
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,239
<i>Plus, the world's always
changing brightness and hotness,</i>

1015
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:19,793
<i>and there's invisible germs
floating everywhere.</i>

1016
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,998
<i>When I was small,
I only knew small things,</i>

1017
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,800
<i>but now I'm five,
I know everything.</i>

1018
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,395
Here we are.

1019
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,199
We're outside the Newsome home.

1020
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,880
We're waiting,
and there are two vans...

1021
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,316
We're walking out in this?

1022
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,880
We're getting out here.

1023
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,076
Come on, sweetie. It's okay.
Just pick him up.

1024
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,200
Come here, Jack.

1025
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,633
Mrs. Newsome, Channel 5--

1026
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,032
Don't worry about it.
They'll get bored quickly.

1027
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,315
- The back of the property...
- Are you okay?

1028
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,516
...Is screened-in really well,

1029
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,590
and we've taken care
where necessary.

1030
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,870
Okay.

1031
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,757
So if you keep
the front drapes closed...

1032
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,840
You're home now.

1033
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,070
...You'll have
complete privacy.

1034
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,355
We'll be outside
if you need anything at all.

1035
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,557
All right. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1036
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,120
Your father's still
talking to the lawyer.

1037
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,276
Do you want to take
your shoes off?

1038
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:15,958
Wow!

1039
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,634
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1040
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,720
Okay.

1041
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,439
Let's check out downstairs.

1042
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,400
You can do it.

1043
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,073
You want to hold my hand?

1044
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,674
Oh, that's good.

1045
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,956
Come on, one step at a time.

1046
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,438
- Okay, one more. Good.
- Hello.

1047
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,320
- Welcome home, honey.
- Hi.

1048
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,914
I'm very, very happy to see you.

1049
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,231
- Hey, Jack.
- You, too.

1050
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,320
This is Leo.

1051
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,834
Hey there, sport.

1052
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,195
Leo's been our friend
since your mom was little.

1053
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,237
Jack, Jack, come on. Say--

1054
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,152
It's okay. It's okay.
Yeah, it's all right.

1055
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,232
It's all right, sweetie.

1056
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,231
- Let's just--
- Sorry.

1057
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,720
It's okay. Come on in.

1058
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,838
So, what can I get you?

1059
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,400
Anyone hungry?

1060
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,596
We have everything.

1061
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,319
Yeah, people have been so kind.

1062
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,313
Um, hey, Jack, would you like
something to drink?

1063
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,153
Jack?

1064
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,550
Grandma asked you a question.
Do you want something?

1065
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,313
Are you hungry?

1066
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,274
Juice.

1067
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,870
Uh, he would like some juice.
Please.

1068
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:23,791
- Okay.
- Coming right up.

1069
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,880
Thank you.

1070
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,235
- What about--
- I'm fine.

1071
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,913
- Okay.
- Okay.

1072
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,000
Hey. You know when your Grandma
asks you a question?

1073
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,839
You can answer her.

1074
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,037
You don't need to say everything
to me, okay?

1075
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,554
Just...

1076
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,590
- Ma.?
- What?

1077
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,000
What are those?

1078
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,673
Those are toys,
some gifts for you,

1079
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,516
from people that are very happy
that we got home safe.

1080
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,759
What people?

1081
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,475
Just people.

1082
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,999
Do you have
the glasses and the tray?

1083
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,550
Where's the ice cream
and the hammock?

1084
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,194
I don't know.

1085
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,439
Work it out later.

1086
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,469
What is that?
Let me see that.

1087
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,389
Where'd you get this?

1088
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,675
Over there.

1089
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,479
Just in case.

1090
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,517
Do you have a dog?

1091
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,829
Oh.

1092
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,559
It's Leo's dog, Seamus.

1093
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,231
He's on furlough
at the moment.

1094
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,437
There's a pal of mine
out of town,

1095
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,749
so living
the country life.

1096
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,234
You know,
people at the hospital

1097
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,519
said to avoid pets
until your immunity's back up.

1098
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,115
What?

1099
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,190
The lawyer said
they're expecting a plea,

1100
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,794
but we can't rule out a trial.

1101
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,633
He wanted to get
into everything.

1102
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,597
I said not today.

1103
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,478
Good.

1104
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,517
I made it clear
there'd be no further contact,

1105
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,829
no statements,

1106
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,390
to respect our family.

1107
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,872
Ah, sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm--

1108
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,997
Can I get you
a drink, Bob?

1109
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,799
Thank you.

1110
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,792
Scotch, if you have--
whatever you have.

1111
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,837
Sure.

1112
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,074
Well, sweetie,

1113
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,230
is there anything you'd like,

1114
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,677
or like to do, or...

1115
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,757
You got it.
You got it.

1116
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,080
Go on.

1117
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,640
Yeah.

1118
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,912
This is your mom's
room, Jack.

1119
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,800
Hey.

1120
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:03,951
Uh, maybe tomorrow,

1121
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,110
we can cut that hair.

1122
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,520
What do you say, Jack?

1123
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,715
Ma?

1124
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,991
What? What?

1125
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,958
It's where my strong is...

1126
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,475
That's true.

1127
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,313
He says
that's where his strong is.

1128
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,357
Oh. Yeah.

1129
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,590
Um...

1130
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,875
Maybe I'll just
let you rest, huh,

1131
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,792
and we'll--
we'll see you downstairs.

1132
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,155
We'll be downstairs, okay?

1133
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,240
- Okay.
- Okay.

1134
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,436
Mm. It's really good, Nancy.

1135
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,155
Want to try some?

1136
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,799
No?

1137
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,439
It's apples.
You like apples.

1138
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,000
How about some ice cream?

1139
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,958
Here you go.

1140
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,998
What do you say?

1141
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,400
Thank you.

1142
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,436
I know you can say it
louder than that.

1143
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,590
Thank you.

1144
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,440
- It's okay.
- Thank you for being polite.

1145
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,191
- Leo?
- It's good.

1146
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,190
Ice cream hurts.

1147
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,670
You've got a brain freeze
there, Jack.

1148
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,355
You've just
got to eat slower. Okay?

1149
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,158
I think I'll turn in.

1150
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,956
Is there something wrong?

1151
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,351
Mm-mm. No.

1152
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,994
Why are you in such a hurry?

1153
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,835
Been a big day.

1154
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,356
You haven't said
one word to Jack.

1155
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,916
Joy. Joy.

1156
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,391
Um...

1157
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,631
We're not going
to have to talk about this now?

1158
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,913
Yes, we do, Dad.

1159
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,520
Look at him.

1160
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,120
Dad.

1161
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,631
Robert.

1162
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,552
Please.

1163
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,599
Dad.

1164
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,479
I'm--I'm sorry.

1165
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,392
I'm sorry. I can't.

1166
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,511
- We're out of here.
- Robert.

1167
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,636
Joy. Joy.

1168
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,040
Put your spoon down.
Let's go.

1169
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,200
- Hey.
- We're going to bed.

1170
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:43,991
No, Joy, don't-- Joy!

1171
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,440
Robert.

1172
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,272
Where's Grandpa?

1173
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,960
He had to go home for a while.

1174
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,156
You want to play
with some of those toys?

1175
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,714
Do you know who that is?

1176
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,836
This?

1177
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,240
That's you.

1178
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,118
Yeah, that's me.

1179
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,591
And Stacey Benton

1180
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:51,909
and Heather Noel

1181
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,676
and Laura Sullivan.

1182
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,912
We were on a relay team.

1183
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,912
I was the anchor.

1184
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,391
I was really fast.

1185
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,153
We did track.

1186
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,038
- Real track?
- Mm-hmm.

1187
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,118
On a field.

1188
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,756
You know what happened to them?

1189
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,237
- No.
- Exactly.

1190
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,720
Nothing.

1191
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,110
Just lived their life
and nothing happened.

1192
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,158
Nothing new at this point.

1193
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,993
Just a family reunited.

1194
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:01,911
How is Jack doing?

1195
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,355
How is the family doing?

1196
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,670
Jack, get away from the window.

1197
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,957
Jack?

1198
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,030
Wonderful.

1199
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,589
So, the other thing
that we need to discuss

1200
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,558
is some sort of media strategy.

1201
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,429
God, we're not ready
for talking like that, not yet,

1202
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,431
so...

1203
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,318
Okay, um...

1204
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,120
There's gonna be
expenses moving forward

1205
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,720
and a "Prime Time" interview,

1206
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,439
just one
"Prime Time" interview,

1207
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,920
means a lot of money.

1208
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,551
Ma, how long
are we going to be here for?

1209
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,312
This is
where we live now, Jack.

1210
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,474
...As much information
as I can give you.

1211
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,074
I'm sure Nancy knows more.

1212
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,311
I'll get her to call you
when she gets in.

1213
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,160
- Thanks.
- Thanks again.

1214
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,796
Okay, so...

1215
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,679
What am I gonna do now?

1216
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,037
I wonder if there's
anybody around that would...

1217
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,397
play with me or talk to me.

1218
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,956
I guess not.

1219
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,120
I'm pretty hungry.

1220
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,350
Oh, I know.

1221
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,511
I got something
in the kitchen, I think.

1222
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,991
Oh, yes,
I've got something very...

1223
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,635
tasty in the kitchen, I think.

1224
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,358
Let me see what's here.

1225
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,360
Hello.

1226
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,397
I didn't know you were up.

1227
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,550
Pretty good, hmm?
Am I right?

1228
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,797
I like this kind, too.

1229
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,075
Kind of sweet,

1230
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,310
but they're pretty good.

1231
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,793
Do you really have a dog?

1232
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,634
I do.

1233
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,720
Named Seamus.

1234
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,311
He's very small.

1235
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:37,156
He's not very smart.

1236
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,233
You should meet him sometime.

1237
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,278
He'll shake your hand.

1238
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,798
I had a dog once named Lucky.

1239
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:49,920
- Mm?
- But he wasn't real.

1240
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,838
Yeah?

1241
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,190
He lived in Room.

1242
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,471
Hmm.

1243
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,311
So we've got
some fluffy clouds in the sky.

1244
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,711
Mm-hmm.

1245
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,678
It looks like a nice day.

1246
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,991
Which one of these
guys is you?

1247
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,193
- That guy?
- Mm-hmm.

1248
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,516
And who's this?

1249
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,190
What is that?

1250
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,351
It's a whale.

1251
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,477
This guy
sees blood under the eyes,

1252
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,750
so he wants to go diving...

1253
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,840
I'm sorry.

1254
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,030
...to help too.

1255
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,839
No, it's okay.

1256
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,240
No, don't worry about it.

1257
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,320
Let her rest.

1258
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,197
I'm almost done here.

1259
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,794
Okay.

1260
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,360
Well, I'm really
looking forward

1261
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,715
to seeing how
this masterpiece turns out.

1262
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,031
Don't worry about it.

1263
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,190
I just--

1264
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,350
I just couldn't
get her to come down.

1265
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,556
Don't worry about it.

1266
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,313
It's perfectly normal.

1267
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,392
Yes, I understand.

1268
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,000
It's gonna take time
for her to heal.

1269
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:51,033
- She's been home, what, 10 days?
- Mm-hmm.

1270
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,389
Mm.

1271
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,674
<i>I need your help!</i>

1272
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,240
<i>Will you check my backpack</i>

1273
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,512
<i>for something we can use
to fix the wheel?</i>

1274
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,069
The same backpack has vanished--

1275
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,317
Jack, can you go downstairs,
please?

1276
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,636
Now.

1277
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,193
<i>- Great!</i>
- Jack!

1278
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,560
Come here.

1279
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,954
Look! You have all these toys.

1280
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,395
I don't want to.

1281
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,631
Any kid would be so happy
to have these, and you--

1282
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,796
you barely even touched them.

1283
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,439
Try your Lego.

1284
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,432
See these?

1285
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,158
Put these together, like this.

1286
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,153
You see how I'm doing it?

1287
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,240
Try it.

1288
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,194
Is it fun?

1289
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,469
Jack?

1290
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,714
Can you say something?

1291
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,552
Jack!

1292
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,356
He needs to play
with something real.

1293
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,160
I'm worried about him
being on the phone.

1294
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,469
He's doing fine.

1295
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,836
Well, I don't give him my phone,

1296
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,990
so I'd appreciate it
if you didn't give him yours.

1297
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:23,991
Okay, I won't.

1298
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,480
Great.

1299
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,993
I just want him
to connect with something.

1300
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,957
Joy.

1301
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:43,590
Joy, he's really
doing fine.

1302
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,240
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1303
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,710
I'm supposed
to be happy.

1304
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,234
You just need to rest, okay?

1305
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,357
No, I don't.

1306
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,556
I don't need to rest!

1307
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,596
That's--
that's what the doctor--

1308
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:57,557
That is not
what the doctor said.

1309
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:58,720
You don't know
what he said,

1310
01:25:58,760 --> 01:25:59,876
because it was
a confidential conversation,

1311
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,110
and you don't know
what he said.

1312
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,634
All right, all right, all right!

1313
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,910
You're impossible to talk to
right now.

1314
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,229
Well, sorry.

1315
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,313
- No. No, you're not sorry!
- Yeah, I'm not sorry!

1316
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,232
You have no idea what's
going on in my head.

1317
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,391
Yeah. Well, try me!

1318
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,351
I have asked you.

1319
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,800
And then what?

1320
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,758
Then, every time you look at me,
that's all that you see?

1321
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,072
When I look at you, Joy,
I will see my daughter.

1322
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,517
You don't need me.

1323
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,353
You've been doing just fine
without me.

1324
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,432
Oh.

1325
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,956
How can you say that, huh?

1326
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,435
Do you think that

1327
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,558
you were the only one
whose life was destroyed?

1328
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,154
Actually, that's
exactly what I think.

1329
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,240
Yeah? How would you feel

1330
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,111
if somebody took
Jack away from you?

1331
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,077
Oh, shut up!

1332
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,160
Go easy.

1333
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,879
Look at him!

1334
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,077
You should be thinking
about him!

1335
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:47,153
Oh, don't you tell me
how to look after my son.

1336
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,993
I'm sorry
that I'm not nice anymore,

1337
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,400
but you know what?

1338
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,632
Maybe if your voice saying
"Be nice"

1339
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,040
hadn't been in my head,

1340
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,720
then maybe
I wouldn't have helped the guy

1341
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,393
with the fucking sick dog!

1342
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,320
Stay there, Jack.

1343
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,879
I'm calling
the fucking lawyer.

1344
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,678
I can't stay in this place.

1345
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,551
Isabel, so, what are thinking
for the walk and talk?

1346
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,757
And I want you to know that
you guide this interview, okay?

1347
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,479
So, what you feel
comfortable with,

1348
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,511
you talk about it,

1349
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,600
and when you don't,

1350
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,194
you just say,
"not comfortable,"

1351
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,640
and we move on
to another question.

1352
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,720
Okay.

1353
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,870
And I'm gonna...
you know?

1354
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,996
My lawyer said--
said that it's nice...

1355
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,480
You're good.

1356
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,358
Thanks.

1357
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,794
And speed.

1358
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,195
Did you ever think
you would see this house again?

1359
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,351
- I hoped.
- You hoped?

1360
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:55,760
Yes.

1361
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,160
It's time
to go downstairs, Jack.

1362
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,919
Remember what your mom said?

1363
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,913
...So many silly things.

1364
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,515
Jokes with friends and...

1365
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,996
Sure, absolutely.

1366
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,751
- It can get hot, can't it?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. The lights.

1367
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,593
The lights, they get very warm.

1368
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,000
Just let me get this
out of the way.

1369
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,640
<i>...Two touchdowns were decisive</i>

1370
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,393
<i>in that game against Michigan</i>

1371
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,711
<i>and would've won in overtime
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

1372
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,270
<i>...But I think they got
a false start...</i>

1373
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,033
<i>Listening to you,</i>

1374
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:44,160
<i>I'm sure you must have felt
at times as if...</i>

1375
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:47,278
God had deserted you.

1376
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,352
In those
very black moments...

1377
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,193
Yeah.

1378
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,875
...did you consider
taking your own life,

1379
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,280
just to escape?

1380
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,191
I'm getting
the feeling my client's very--

1381
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,280
It's okay. I'm okay.

1382
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,760
- Can you give her a minute?
- Sure.

1383
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,353
I'm fine.
Can I just have a tissue?

1384
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,039
Of course. Can we get
her a tissue, please?

1385
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,680
- Here you go.
- Hard to talk about.

1386
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,195
- I'm sure.
- Sorry.

1387
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,913
You don't have to apologize.

1388
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,798
Nobody's expecting you to be,

1389
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,997
you know,
the pillar of strength.

1390
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,679
You can cry.

1391
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,400
You know, why don't we just
go on to the next question?

1392
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,437
Would that be okay?

1393
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,432
Do you want to put your tissue
maybe under your chair?

1394
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,398
Oh, yeah.

1395
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,630
There you go, huh?

1396
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,594
There's snot in my nose.

1397
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,313
- Let's see? Good.
- Okay.

1398
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:38,193
So...

1399
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,114
when Jack came along,

1400
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,509
was it different for you then?

1401
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,035
Um, when Jack came,

1402
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,910
everything was different.

1403
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:52,757
He was so beautiful, and...

1404
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,470
I just knew that
I had to keep him safe.

1405
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,515
Of course.

1406
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,240
When he's older,

1407
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,995
will you tell Jack
about his father?

1408
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,193
Jack's not his.

1409
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,080
He's not his--

1410
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,596
So are you saying that
there were other men?

1411
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,314
No!

1412
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:19,278
No.

1413
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,360
Um...

1414
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,359
a father is...

1415
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,960
a man who loves his child.

1416
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:25,951
Of course.

1417
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,040
That's so true

1418
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,955
in a very real sense, but the...

1419
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,872
...the biological relationship
that you--

1420
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,838
That's not a relationship.

1421
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:40,597
Jack is--
is nobody's but mine.

1422
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,839
When he was born, did it--

1423
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,832
did it ever occur to you

1424
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,195
to ask your captor

1425
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,670
to take Jack away?

1426
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,509
Away?

1427
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,950
Well, to take him to a hospital,

1428
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,714
say, leave him there,
where he could found?

1429
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,232
Why-- why would I do that?

1430
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,960
So Jack could be free.

1431
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,714
Now, this is
the ultimate sacrifice--

1432
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,076
and I understand that--

1433
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:20,870
but did you think about him
having a normal childhood?

1434
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,554
But he had me.

1435
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,394
Of course he did.

1436
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:30,156
But was that
the best thing for him?

1437
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,354
Ma?

1438
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,157
Ma?

1439
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,800
Ma!

1440
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,077
- Ma! Ma!
- What, what, Jack?

1441
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,833
- Ma!
- What? What is it?

1442
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,957
- Ma!
- Jack!

1443
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,076
Joy!

1444
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,310
- Come here, Jack. Come here.
- Ma!

1445
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,471
Come here, come here, come here.

1446
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,711
Come on, Joy. Wake up.

1447
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,314
- Ma! Ma!
- I'll call 911!

1448
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,359
Hello? Hi.

1449
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,636
How's she doing?

1450
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,599
I don't know.
He's upstairs.

1451
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,990
Jack?

1452
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,714
Come on.

1453
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,349
Phone's for you.

1454
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,398
Here, here.
Here you go.

1455
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,236
- Say, "Hello".
- Hello.

1456
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,313
<i>Jack? Jack?</i>

1457
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,080
<i>Are you there?</i>

1458
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,919
Ma?

1459
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,480
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1460
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:06,915
Come back.

1461
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,675
<i>I-I can't just yet.</i>

1462
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,149
Come back now!

1463
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,320
<i>I'll be there soon.</i>

1464
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,993
<i>I just have to be here
just a little while longer.</i>

1465
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:16,391
I pick!
I pick for both of us.

1466
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,752
<i>I-- I'm coming back soon!
Jack. Jack?</i>

1467
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,753
<i>Hello? Leo?</i>

1468
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,032
<i>There's so much
of place in the world.</i>

1469
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,800
<i>There's less time,</i>

1470
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,360
<i>because the time
has to be spread extra thin</i>

1471
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,920
<i>over all the places,</i>

1472
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,673
<i>like butter.</i>

1473
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,832
<i>So all the persons say,</i>

1474
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,391
<i>"Hurry up. Let's get going.
Pick up the pace.</i>

1475
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,950
<i>Finish up now."</i>

1476
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,116
<i>Ma was in a hurry
to go boing up to heaven,</i>

1477
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,751
<i>but she forgot me,
Dumbo Ma.</i>

1478
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,953
<i>So the aliens
threw her back down,</i>

1479
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,236
<i>crash!</i>

1480
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,638
<i>And broke her.</i>

1481
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,473
Okay.

1482
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,515
You good?

1483
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,159
Can you help me carry
a bag of groceries?

1484
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,400
Yep.

1485
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,194
- Is that okay?
- Yep.

1486
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:30,834
Okay, cool.

1487
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,555
Thank you.
It's light.

1488
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:35,760
All right.

1489
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:39,435
Been shopping?

1490
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,113
Yes, we have.

1491
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,078
We're making cupcakes.

1492
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,160
Oh, yum!

1493
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:46,960
- Have a good day.
- See you.

1494
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,634
Okay. Come on.

1495
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,436
Hmm.

1496
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:01,876
You're really good at that.

1497
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,759
I did it before,
in Room.

1498
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,797
Hmm, you did? Wow.

1499
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:10,994
What else did you do there?

1500
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,080
Lots of stuff.

1501
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,840
Sometimes, I miss it.

1502
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,920
Wasn't it awfully small?

1503
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,719
Mm-mm.

1504
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,870
It went
every direction,

1505
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,354
all the way to the end.

1506
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,954
It never finished.

1507
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,832
And Ma was always there.

1508
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,872
Yeah.

1509
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,037
But it was small
in wardrobe.

1510
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,759
Hmm?

1511
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,399
What did you do in wardrobe?

1512
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,637
Sleep.

1513
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:47,110
When Old Nick came.

1514
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:51,673
I want to see Ma.

1515
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:52,637
Yeah, I know.

1516
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,030
She's, um...

1517
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:58,790
she just needs to be on her own
for a little while.

1518
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,436
Jack?

1519
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,159
Someone here
would like to meet you.

1520
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,193
Jack. Here, let me
get this for you.

1521
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,237
Come on.
Let's go see.

1522
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,358
Jack...

1523
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,794
meet Seamus.

1524
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,714
Would you like to pet him?

1525
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,753
Yeah.

1526
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:51,915
There he goes, shaking again.

1527
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It makes him feel good.

1528
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,190
Makes him... feel good?

1529
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,320
Yeah, makes him feel good.

1530
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,360
You should try that.

1531
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,992
Well, he's moving.

1532
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,879
Grandma?

1533
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:50,996
Yes.

1534
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,400
I need the scissors.

1535
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,675
What for?

1536
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,080
For cutting my hair.

1537
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,439
Do you really want to do that?

1538
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,432
I want to send it to Ma.

1539
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,710
How come?

1540
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,359
She needs my strong
more than me,

1541
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,715
so I want to send it to her,

1542
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,360
or you could take it to her?

1543
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:13,316
I could help you, if you'd like?

1544
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,629
Yes, please.

1545
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:17,679
Okay. Okay.

1546
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:20,395
Let's do this right.

1547
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,000
I have been wanting
to cut that hair...

1548
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,271
for a very long time.

1549
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,238
Come on.

1550
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,993
I used to cut
your mother's hair all the time,

1551
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,720
and your Grandpa's.

1552
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,800
I hope I've still got it.

1553
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,559
Do you think this will work?

1554
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,917
Can my strong
be her strong, too?

1555
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,560
Oh. Of course it can.

1556
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:44,234
We all help each other
stay strong.

1557
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,320
No one is strong alone.

1558
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,750
You know, you and your mom,

1559
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,672
you help each other through,
don't you?

1560
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,116
- Yep.
- Mm-hmm.

1561
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,600
And you and me,
you and Leo,

1562
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,512
Leo and me.

1563
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,274
We all have the same strong.

1564
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,272
- I guess we do.
- Okay.

1565
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,520
All righty.

1566
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,039
Are you ready?

1567
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,719
Steady...

1568
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,432
Here. See?

1569
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,360
See?

1570
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,149
What do you think?

1571
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,240
Wow!

1572
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:41,233
Ooh! Oh, yeah.

1573
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,952
You can't get
soap in my eye.

1574
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,156
No, there's a towel right there
if you need it.

1575
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:47,515
Here we go.

1576
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:50,360
- And my mouth.
- Your mouth, too.

1577
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:54,593
This is the best part. Oh!

1578
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:56,956
- Mm.
- Doesn't it feel good?

1579
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:01,319
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

1580
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:02,550
Oh, let's see.

1581
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,914
There.

1582
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:16,989
I love you, Grandma.

1583
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,158
I love you, too, Jack.

1584
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,514
Keeps on happening.

1585
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,560
I'm sorry, Jack.

1586
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:56,960
It's okay.

1587
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,800
Don't do it again.

1588
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:03,395
I promise.

1589
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:08,200
Are you better now?

1590
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:12,756
Yeah, I'm starting to be.

1591
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:30,400
Hey, Jack.

1592
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:31,440
Yeah?

1593
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,118
When Grandma
brought this to me...

1594
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:45,278
I knew that I could get better.

1595
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,596
You saved me...

1596
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,680
again.

1597
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,200
Can I...

1598
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,038
No.

1599
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:03,680
There's no more left, sorry.

1600
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:10,272
Okay.

1601
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,594
I'm not a good enough Ma.

1602
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:22,874
But you're Ma.

1603
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,350
I am.

1604
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,839
I am.

1605
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:44,632
I'm going to play with Aran now.

1606
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:46,479
He's my friend.

1607
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:53,920
Okay.

1608
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,432
<i>When I was four,</i>

1609
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,791
I didn't even know
about the world,

1610
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,712
and now me and Ma
are going to live in it

1611
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,157
forever and ever
until we're dead.

1612
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:17,880
<i>This is a street</i>

1613
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
<i>in a city</i>

1614
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,312
<i>in a country called America,</i>

1615
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:22,834
<i>and Earth,</i>

1616
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:26,197
that's a blue and green planet,
<i>always spinning,</i>

1617
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,954
<i>so I don't know
why we don't fall off.</i>

1618
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,310
<i>Then, there's Outer Space.</i>

1619
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:34,916
<i>And nobody knows
where's heaven.</i>

1620
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,994
Pull yourself out!

1621
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:45,152
<i>Ma and I have decided</i>

1622
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,038
<i>that because we don't know
what we like,</i>

1623
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,952
<i>we get to try everything.</i>

1624
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:57,636
<i>There are so many things
out here.</i>

1625
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:00,076
<i>And sometimes, it's scary,</i>

1626
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,874
<i>but that's okay,</i>

1627
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,555
<i>because it's still
just you and me.</i>

1628
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,556
Can we go back to Room?

1629
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,871
Jack...

1630
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:20,872
Just for a visit.

1631
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:30,556
Watch your step.

1632
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,795
Is this Room?

1633
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:40,880
Yeah.

1634
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:45,119
Has it gotten shrinked?

1635
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,913
Where is everything?

1636
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:51,558
Taken for evidence.

1637
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:54,798
Proof that we were here.

1638
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,832
It's because Door's open.

1639
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:28,475
What?

1640
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:32,310
It can't really be Room
if Door's open.

1641
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,634
Do you want me to close it?

1642
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,110
Nah.

1643
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:47,874
Jack, can we go?

1644
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:57,715
Bye, Plant.

1645
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:00,315
Bye, Chair number one.

1646
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,472
Bye, Chair number two.

1647
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:04,560
Bye, Table.

1648
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,793
Bye, wardrobe.

1649
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,997
