00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,167
- A dead mouse!
- (FEAR SCREAMS)

160
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,049
ANGER: Great. This is just great.
DISGUST: I'm gonna be sick.

161
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,565
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

162
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,085
- Get off of me!
- (FEAR SCREAMING)

163
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,486
Hey. All through the drive,

164
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,449
Dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

165
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,567
- (FEAR SIGHS)
- Let's go check it out!

166
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,727
DISGUST: Let's go!
ANGER: It's gonna be great!

167
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,801
FEAR: Yes, yes, yes.

168
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,486
DISGUST: I'm starting
to envy the dead mouse.

170
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,561
ANGER: Get out the rubber ball,

171
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,971
we're in solitary confinement.

172
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,041
Riley can't live here.

173
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,121
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

174
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,611
FEAR: Really bad.
DISGUST: It's absolutely the worst.

175
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
DISGUST: It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

176
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,162
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

178
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,691
- Where did you read that?
- It doesn't matter.

179
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I read it and it's great.

180
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,921
We'll put the bed there.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,081
JOY: And the desk over there.

182
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,321
FEAR: The hockey lamp goes there.

183
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,402
ANGER: Uh, put the chair there.

184
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,040
JOY: The trophy collection goes there.

185
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,684
FEAR: Stars! I like that!

186
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,841
JOY: Now we're talking!

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,680
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van!

188
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,565
DAD: All right. Goodbye.

189
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,681
Well, guess what?

190
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,480
The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

191
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,965
- You're kidding.
- Mmm-hmm.

192
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,327
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

193
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,960
DISGUST: That figures. The van is lost.

194
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,526
You said it would be here yesterday!

195
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,886
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,047
FEAR: Mom and Dad are stressed out!

197
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,969
ANGER: They're stressed out?
FEAR: What are we going to do?

198
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,560
- (ALL TALKING AT ONCE)
- I've got a great idea!

199
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,250
Did you even read the contract?

200
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,887
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

201
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,961
Hey! (LAUGHS)

202
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,041
DAD: Oh, no, you're not!

203
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,207
She's lining up for the shot!

204
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,281
DAD: Coming behind you.

205
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,124
- DAD: Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores!

206
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,810
- Yeah!
- (ALL CHEERING)

207
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,962
- Come on, Grandma!
- Ha!

208
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
"Grandma"?

209
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,004
Uh-oh, she put her hair up,
we're in for it!

210
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,606
Whoo!

211
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,529
- Hey, put me down!

- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Ah! Sorry.

215
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,687
Hold on. Hold on.

216
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,562
- Hello?
- Wait. Wh...

217
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,846
DAD: You're kidding.

218
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,285
(SIGHS) All right. Stall for me.

219
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,401
I'll be right there.

220
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,370
The investor's supposed
to show up on Thursday,

221
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,601
not today!

222
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,131
- (SIGHS)
- I got to go.

223
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,605
It's okay. We get it.

224
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,926
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

225
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
See you, sweetie.

226
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,320
FEAR: Dad just left us.

227
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,004
He doesn't love us anymore.

228
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,241
That's sad.

229
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,890
I should drive, right?

230
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,447
Joy?

231
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,286
What are you doing?

232
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,970
Uh, just give me one second.

233
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,089
Um, you know what I've realized?

234
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,561
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

235
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,606
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.

236
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,761
Maybe we could try that?

237
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,205
Pizza sounds delicious.

238
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,850
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

239
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,760
FEAR: What the heck is that?
JOY: Who puts broccoli on pizza?

240
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,921
That's it. I'm done.

241
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,122
Congratulations, San Francisco,

242
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,406
you've ruined pizza!

243
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,686
First the Hawaiians

244
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,001
and now you!

245
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,447
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

246
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,883
MOM: Must be
a San Francisco thing, huh?

247
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,250
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.

248
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,288
- At that diner in Nebraska.
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,761
The spoon stood up in the soup by itself!

250
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,080
RILEY: That was disgusting.

251
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,650
JOY: Oh, good. Family is running.

252
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,080
RILEY: Dad's got a steel stomach.

253
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,804
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?

254
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
What was your favorite part?

255
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,645
Spitting out the car window!

256
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,200
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

257
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,281
Wearing a seat belt!

258
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,120
Oh! What about the time
with the dinosaur?

259
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,120
- Oh, that's the one.
- Definitely!

260
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,641
DAD: Say cheese!

261
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,250
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

262
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,640
DAD: Now hold still.
MOM: The car!

263
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,929
Stop! No, no, no! (GRUNTING)

(DAD GROANS)

265
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,961
(LAUGHS) Nice one, Joy.

266
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,610
I liked that time at the dinosaur.

267
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,284
- That was pretty funny.

269
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,085
Wait. What? What happened?

270
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,320
FEAR: She did something
to the memory.

271
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,727
- What did you do?
- I just touched it.

272
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,683
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

273
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,006
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

274
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,049
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, Sadness.

275
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,810
Now when Riley thinks
of that moment with Dad,

276
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,120
she's gonna feel sad.

277
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,805
- Bravo.
- I'm sorry, Joy.

278
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,120
I don't really know...

279
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,685
I thought maybe if you...

(STAMMERING)

281
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,363
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

282
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,046
Just don't touch any other memories

283
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
until we figure out what's going on.

284
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,727
- Okay.
- JOY: All right.

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,048
Get ready. This is a monster railing

286
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,083
and we are riding it all the way down!

287
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,200
- Wait, what? What happened?
- (CLATTERING)

288
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
- (FEAR AND JOY GASP)
- A Core Memory!

289
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,561
Oh, no!

290
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,846
Sadness, what are you doing?

291
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,921
SADNESS: It looked like
one was crooked

292
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,929
so I opened it and then it fell out.

293
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,041
I...

294
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,241
Whoo-hoo!

295
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,724
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

- FEAR: Joy!
- Whoa, whoa!

297
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,562
Sadness, you nearly
touched a Core Memory.

298
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,001
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

299
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,241
I know. I'm sorry.

300
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,084
Something's wrong with me.

301
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,089
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

302
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,248
You're not having
a breakdown. It's stress.

303
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,011
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

304
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,242
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

305
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,289
(STUTTERING) You know what?

306
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,289
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

307
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,084
There's always a way to
turn things around,

308
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,605
to find the fun.

309
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,484
Yeah. Find the fun.

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,240
I don't know how to do that.

311
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,731
Okay. Well,

312
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,290
try to think of something funny.

313
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,641
Um... Oh!

314
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,445
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

315
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,483
Oh. Yeah, that's not...

316
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,284
What about that time with Meg

317
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,283

957
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,806
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

958
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,564
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

959
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,360
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

960
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,601
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

961

JOY: Oh, I am so glad we ran into you!

962
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,251
The station is right
through here. After you.

963
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,606
- Joy.
- What?

964
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,404
I read about this place

965
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,124
in the manual. We shouldn't go in there.

966
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,203
Bing Bong says
it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

967
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,368
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

968
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,560
What are you talking about?

969
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,411
I go in here all the time.
It's a shortcut, you see?

970
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,207
D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

971
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,204
Look at me. I'm closer to the station

972
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,204
because I'm taking the shortcut.

Hmm. Looks like
there's something in there.
