1
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,600
Last orders, please.

2
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
- Shaun.
- Yeah?

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,800
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, totally.

4
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,900
I know he's your best friend
but you do live with him.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
I know...

6
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,300
It's not that I don't like Ed.
Ed, it's not that I don't like you.

7
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,800
It's all right.

8
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,100
- It'd just be nice if we could...
- Fuck.

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,500
...spend a bit more time together.
- Bollocks.

10
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,700
- Just the two of us.
- Cock it.

11
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,200
With Ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out

12
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,600
and that only exacerbates things.

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
- What do you mean?
- You guys hardly get on, do you?

14
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,800
No, what does "exacerbate" mean?

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It means to make things worse.

16
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,100
Right, right.

17
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, I mean, it's not that
I don't like David and Di, you know.

18
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,700
- Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
- It's all right.

19
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,100
And I do want to spend time with you.

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,200
It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends.

21
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,700
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Anybody?

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,300
No, thank you.

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,700
I know...

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,000
friends are important to Shaun

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,100
but you must set some
quality time aside for yourselves.

27
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,600
Daffs is always taking me
to see these listed buildings

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,300
and I'm always dragging him to the theatre.

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,300
- I'm not so hot on theatre.
- How about a meal?

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
- It's your anniversary soon.
- It was last week.

31
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,500
- Did you do anything special?
- We came here.

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Shaun. Hog lumps.

33
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,300
Shaun, what I'm trying to say is
I need something more,

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,000
more than spending every night
in the Winchester.

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,500
I want to do more interesting stuff.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,800
I want you to want to want to do it.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,100
Listen to me.
I'm beginning to sound like your mum.

38
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,100
- Not that I'd know.
- You haven't met his mum?

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,100
- Not yet.
- Don't you get along with your mum?

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,700
- It's not her...
- Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?

41
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,200
- No, I love my mum.
- I love his mum.

42
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,600
- # She's like butter #
- Ed!

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,900
- Shaun!
- Liz.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,100
I understand what
you're trying to say and I agree.

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,700
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.

46
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,200
I'll book a restaurant.
The place that does all the fish.

47
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,200
Just the two of us.

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,200
Things will change. I promise.

49
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,100
Really, Shaun?

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,300
Time, gentlemen.

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,100
- # This town is coming like a ghost town #
- Shaun?

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,500
'Player two has entered the game.'

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,800
Haven't you got work?

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,700
'Player two has left the game.'

55
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,900
The front door was open again last night.

56
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,200
- I'm not saying it was you.
- I know, man.

57
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,100
- I'm saying it was Ed.
- Right.

58
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I can't live like this.

59
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,100
Look at the state of it.
We're not students any more.

60
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,200
- Pete...
- He brings no money into the house.

61
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,200
- He brings a bit.
- What? Dealing drugs?

62
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,500
He sells a bit of weed now and again.
You've sold puff.

63
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,400
Yeah, once. At college. To you.

64
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,300
I've known him since primary school.
I like having him around, he's a laugh.

65
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,200
Because he can
impersonate an orang-utan?

66
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,900
- Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
- Leave him alone.

67
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,000
I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion.

68
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,700
Like that time we stayed up all night drinking
apple schnapps and playing Tekken 2.

69
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,700
- When was that?
- Five years ago.

70
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,100
When's he going home?

71
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,700
Hey, man, listen... Top left.

72
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,400
- Uh-huh.
- I was gonna say... Reload.

73
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,700
- I'm on it.
- Erm, since... Nice shot!

74
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Thanks.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,700
Two seconds.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,300
- All right, Noodle?
- 'Got anything? '

77
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,800
- No, man.
- 'Eball says you was holding.'

78
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,300
- I ain't got nothing.
- 'Nothing at all? '

79
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,800
I've only got an 'enry meself.
All right, laters.

80
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
- Listen...
- Ed...

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,500
since you're not working at the moment
could you please clean up a bit?

82
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,600
And if you play the answer machine,
can you take down everyone's messages?

83
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,900
- Yep.
- It's not that taxing, is it?

84
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,100
Writing something
on a scrap of paper?

85
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,500
- Nope.
- Right.

86
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,300
Dom, hi...

87
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Come on, it was pretty funny.

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,300
- Will you do what he said?
- I ain't doing nothing for him.

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Do it for me, then.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,300
I'm sorry, Shaun.

91
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,700
- It's all right.
- No, no.

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,900
I'm sorry, Shaun.

93
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh!

94
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,300
Oh, my God, that's rotten.

95
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,900
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I am not laughing.

96
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,900
- Get that.
- You get it.

97
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,100
'Shaun, it's me.
I'm gonna be a bit tied up today

98
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,400
'so can you book the table
for eight rather than seven?

99
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,600
'I'll try you at work. Bye, bye.'

100
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,900
Hey! You're dead.

101
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,800
- Spare some change, please, mister?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,500
Watch out. Are you blind?

103
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,800
'The American
deep space probe Omega 6

104

Earth's atmosphere over England

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400

106
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Nelson?

107
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,700
Nelson?

108
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Hello, my friend. No beer today?

109
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,900
No, it's a bit early for me.

110
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,800
Gather round, everyone.
Gather round, please.

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Gather round.

112
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,000
As well as Mr Sloman being off today

113
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm afraid Ash is feeling
a little bit under the weather,

114
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
so I will be taking charge as the...

115
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,600
- Oldest.
- Senior staff member.

116
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,800
So if we can all pull together...

117
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,400
- Hello? Hello, mate.
- Noel?

118
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,100
I was totally munted last night.

119
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Yeah, I spoke to him. He's only got Henry.

120
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
All right, mate. Laters.

121
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,100
- Continue.
- Thank you.

122
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,800
Erm, as Mr Sloman always says,
there's no I in team but there is an I in pie.

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,300
In... There's an I in meat pie.

124
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,000
The anagram of meat is team...
I don't know what he's talking about.

125
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,500
Phones off. It's not a social gathering.

126
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,300
- All right, keep your hair on, grandad.
- Hey! I'm 29 for Christ's sakes.

127
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,900
- How old are you? 20? 21?
- 17.

128
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,300
Hey, well...

129
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,200
I know you don't wanna be here forever.
I got things I wanna do with my life.

130
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,900
When?

131
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,300
You got red on you.

132
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,700
Hello, mate.

133
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,900
This one comes with
a basic digital package.

134
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You've got your lifestyle channels there,
a bit of Trisha.

135
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,000
Er, you've got entertainment.
I don't know what that is.

136
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,600
News. All the basic, er... news...

137
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,200
- channels.
- 'Bizarre events... '

138
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,200
'Coming after me... '

139
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,800
- Shaun.
- I'm with customers.

140
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,700
It's your dad.

141
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,100
He's not my dad,

142
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,300
he's my stepdad.

143
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Philip.

144
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,600
Shaun.

145
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,900
You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
- No.
- Your bimonthly visit.

147
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,100
No, I haven't forgotten.

148
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,900
You could bring the flowers
you forgot on Mother's Day.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I was gonna.

150
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,600
And not a cheap posy
from a garage forecourt.

151
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,100
I wasn't gonna.

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,800
Well, we look forward to
seeing you tomorrow.

153
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,500
OK.

154
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
You've got red on you.

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,300
- I thought it wasn't a social gathering?
- What?

156
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,300
How comes you're allowed to
speak to your dad?

157
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,500
A, he's not my dad, OK? He's my stepdad.

158
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,500
And B, it was an emergency.

159
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,100
What, like buying your mum some flowers?

160
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,400
Noel, I do not find it difficult
to keep my work and my social life separate.

161
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,200
Shaun, it's Liz for you.

162
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,300
- Hello.
- 'Hello, it's me.'

163
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,700
- Hello.
- 'Did you get my message? '

164
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,300
- Yep.
- 'So it's all OK, then? '

165
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,500
- Yep.
- 'Eight at the place with all the fish?

166
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,200
'Cool, that's great. Just ring me later.'

167
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,500
- Goodbye, Liz.
- 'Bye. Bye, bye, bye.'

168
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,900
Liz from Head Office.
It's nothing to panic about.

169
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,600
Sir? Sir?

170
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,300
Sorry. Erm, they're for my mum.

171
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,800
Mum. "To a wonderful Mum"
or "Supermum"?

172
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,900
- Er... the first one.
- Right.

173
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,900
'... London seems
to have gone completely bonkers... '

174
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,400
- Oh, my God! Shaun!
- Yvonne.

175
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,400
Oooh! How are you doing?

176
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,900
- Surviving.
- Are you living round here?

177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,100
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah, I just bought a place.

178
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
- Bought?
- I know, bit grown-up, eh?

179
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,800
- Are you still with...?
- Liz.

180
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,200
That's great. Glad somebody made it.
How long's that been now?

181
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,700
- Er, it's three years ago last week.
- Did you do anything special?

182
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,800
- We're going out for a meal tonight.
- Anywhere nice?

183
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Yeah...

184
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,000
Come on!

185
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,700
- Are you gonna thank me, then?
- For what?

186
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,700
Tidying up.

187
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
- It doesn't look tidy.
- I had a few beers when I finished.

188
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,600
'Hello, Fulci's. Can you hold, please? '

189
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,100
- Do you want your messages?
- What?

190
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,500
Your mum rang about tomorrow night.

191
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,500
Liz rang about the two of you
eating out tonight.

192
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,400
Then your mum rang back to see
if I wanted to eat her out tonight.

193
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,900
- 'Hello, Fulci's.'
- Hi, I know it's short notice

194
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,300
but could you possibly do me
a table for two for tonight at about eight?

195
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,400
'Sorry, we just gave away the last table.'

196
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,700
Wasn't true about your mum.

197
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,400
Where are we gonna go?

198
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,400
- The Winchester.
- Don't be stupid! They don't do food.

199
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
- There's a Breville out back.
- Ed, this is serious!

200
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,900
Hello.

201
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
- 'Hello, it's me.'
- Hello.

202
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,000
'What's the plan, then? '

203
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,400
Erm, there's been a bit of a...
a mix-up with the table, babe.

204
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,000
- 'What do you mean? '
- They're full up.

205
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,900
'But... I thought you said it was all OK? '

206
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,800
Yeah.

207
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,500
'You didn't book it, did you, Shaun? '

208
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,700
- No.
- 'So... what is the plan, then? '

209
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,100
The Winchester?

210
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,900
- 'Hello? '
- Dianne, can you let me in?

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,900
- 'I'm not sure, Shaun.'
- Oh, come on.

212
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,600
'Lizzie doesn't want to see you.'

213
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,500
- Just open the door!
- 'She doesn't want to see you.'

214
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,600
Do you want me to climb up the wall,
come through the window? Because I will.

215
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,800
'You're not coming in.'

216
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,300
- OK, see you in a minute.
- 'Don't... '

217
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,000
'Hi, it's me again.'

218
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,600
Can we just talk about this? Let's go out.

219
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,300
- To the Winchester?
- Do you want to?

220
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,300
- No, I don't fucking want to!
- OK.

221
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,600
It's not the only place in the world.

222
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,700
We'll go to the Shepherd's,
they do Thai in there.

223
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,700
- I'm going out with David and Di.
- Let's go together.

224
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,200
You hang out with my friends?
"A failed actress and a twat"?

225
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,000
That's harsh.
I did not call Dianne a failed actress.

226
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,700
Let's just go somewhere and have a laugh.
Things'll be fine, I promise.

227
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
You promised you'd stop smoking.

228
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,100
You promised you'd try drinking
red wine instead of beer!

229
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,600
- You promised we'd go on holiday.
- We went to Greece!

230
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,100
- We met in Greece.
- At a rave.

231
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,200
It's not the same.
You promised things would change.

232
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,600
- You promised us free cable.
- I'm working on that.

233
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,200
I can give up smoking whenever I want.
See, don't need them.

234
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,200
W- What was the next one?

235
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,700
It's not enough, Shaun.

236
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,500
'We appear to have
a breakdown in communication there.

237
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,300
'Lf you or someone you know may... '

238
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,900
I'd say your nine lives were up, Shaun.

239
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,900
Get fucked, four-eyes!

240
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
You go out with her, you love her so much.

241
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
What do you mean by that?

242
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,300
'... the devastation really is extensive.
It's a total mess.'

243
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,700
I don't know what he meant by that.

244
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Got you these.

245
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,800
- "To a wonderful mum"?
- Oooh!

246
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,500
Yeah, that's because...

247
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,900
I thought it would be funny
because of what you said last night

248
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,900
about you don't want to be
my mum and that.

249
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,800
It's just a little joke,
just sort of spur of the moment.

250
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,000
- They're for your mum, aren't they?
- Yeah.

251
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,800
Smooth.

252
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
If I don't do something, I'll end up in that pub

253
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,200
for the rest of my life
like those other sad old fuckers

254
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,400
wondering what the hell happened.

255
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,700
What do you mean do something?

256
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Fuck her. You got your pint.

257
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?

258
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,900
Oh. You want your favourite monkey?

259
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Shall I do Clyde?

260
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,300
See, I knew you'd get over her.

261
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,600
# If you leave me now... #

262
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,000
Who the hell put this on?

263
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,600
It's on random.

264
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,500
For fuck's sake. John, yes please, mate.

265
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,500
You know what we should do tomorrow?
Keep drinking.

266
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
A Bloody Mary first thing,

267
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,000
a bite at the King's Head,
couple at The Little Princess,

268
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,300
stagger back here and bang...
back at the bar for shots.

269
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
How's that for a slice of fried gold?

270
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,900
- No.
- Come on, man.

271
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,300
Talk to me.

272
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,800
She said if she stayed with me
she'd end up in here for the rest of her life

273
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,400
like these sad old fuckers
wondering what the hell happened.

274
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,500
That is harsh.

275
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,100
- These are rich, interesting characters.
- Like who?

276
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,400
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.

277
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,300
He's a bigamist.

278
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,400
Strangled his first wife
with a draught excluder.

279
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
And invented the mobile disco.

280
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,000
What about her, then?

281
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,500
Ooh! Cockacidal maniac.

282
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
She's an ex-porn star.

283
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,700
They say she starred in
the world's first interracial hardcore loop.

284
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,800
Cafe Au Lait...

285
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,400
Pour Vous.

286
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,900
Yeah. What about John, then?

287
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He's North London Mafia.

288
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
It's true, Big Al says so.

289
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,100
Yeah, Big Al also says dogs can't look up.

290
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanour.

291
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,600
Bernie, the trophy wife.

292
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,500
He's connected.
Why is there a rifle above the bar?

293
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,000
- The pub's called the Winchester.
- Exactly.

294
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,000
See, you don't need Liz to have a good time.

295
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,000
- Don't, man.
- No.

296
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,300
Oi, look at me.

297
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Can I just say one thing? I'm not gonna
say there's plenty more fish in the sea,

298
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,600
I'm not gonna say if you love her let her go

299
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,900
and I'm not gonna bombard you with clichés
but what I will say is this...

300
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,900
it's not the end of the world.

301
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,100
Sorry, we're closed.

302
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,500
Pisshead.

303
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
# Ooh, white lines

304
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,800
# Visions, dreams of passion

305
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,000
# Going through my mind

306
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,700
# And all the while I think of you...

307
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,500
Oh?

308
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,900
What's the matter, love,
haven't you had your tea?

309
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,800
# Something of a phenomenon

What? He should say base.

317

Or freeze.

318

# You wanna dance? #

320
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
Don't scratch it! Wait...

321
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,000
- That was the second album I ever bought!
- It's four in the fucking morning!

322
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
- It's Saturday!
- No, it's not.

323
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,600
It's fucking Sunday
and I've got to go to fucking work

324
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,600
in four fucking hours
because every other fucker is fucking ill!

325
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,400
Now can you see why I'm so fucking angry?

326
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,400
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hey! Pete, look,

327
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,900
I'm sorry, we had a couple of drinks,
we split up with Liz tonight.

328
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,200
Just keep it down, yeah?

329
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,800
Prick.

330
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,700
What was that?

331
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,300
Nothing.

332
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,400
- Stop it, we're friends!
- He's not my friend. He's a fucking idiot.

333
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,200
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means why don't you fuck off!

334
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,000
You wanna live like an animal,
live in the shed, you thick fuck!

335
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,800
- Leave him alone!
- Stop defending him.

336
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,700
All he ever does is hold you back.

337
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,700
Or is it easier having someone around
who's more of a loser than you?

338
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,200
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what I mean.

339
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,000
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?

340
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,500
Sort your fucking life out, mate.

341
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,000
What's up with your hand, man?

342
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,600
- I got mugged on the way home from work.
- By who?

343
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,700
- Some crackheads. One of them bit me.
- Why?

344
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I don't know, I didn't stop to ask them!

345
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,000
I've got a splitting headache
and your stupid hip hop isn't helping.

346
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,900
And the front door is open. Again!

347
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,600
It's not hip hop, it's electro. Prick.

348
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,300
Next time I see him, he's dead.

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,400
- That was quick.
- Ed, this is serious.

464
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,900
Liz!

465
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,400
- 'Shaun.'
- Mum! I was gonna call you. Are you OK?

466
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
- 'Yes.'
- Are you sure?

467
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,200
'Some men tried to get into the house.'

468
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,100
- Are they still there?
- 'I'm not sure. We shut the curtains.'

469
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,900
- Did you try the police?
- 'Well, I thought about it.'

470
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,400
- Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
- 'No, I'm fine.'

471
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,700
- Mum?
- 'Well... they were a bit bitey.'

472
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,500
- Mum, have you been bitten?
- 'No, but Philip has.'

473
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,700
- Oh, OK.
- Has she been bitten?

474
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,500
- No, Philip has.
- Oh, OK.

475
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,000
- Mum, what state is he in?
- 'He's fine. Bit under the weather.'

476
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,900
- I see.
- What's the deal?

477
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,300
We may have to kill my stepdad.
Mum, you're not safe there. I'm coming.

478
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,800
- 'I don't want to cause a fuss.'
- We're coming to get you, Barbara!

479
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,200
So, what's the plan?

480
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,100
Right.

481
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,800
'We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's,

482
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,200
'we go in, we take care of Philip.'

483
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,600
I'm so sorry, Philip.

484
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,200
'Then we grab Mum, go over to Liz's place,

485

486
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,300
'and wait for all this to blow over.'

487
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,400
- Why have we got to go to Liz's?
- Because we do.

488
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,200
- She dumped you.
- I have to know if she's all right.

489
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,800
- Why?
- Because I love her.

490
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
All right, gay.

491
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,600
- I'm not staying there, though.
- Why not?

492
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,500
If we hole up,
I want to be somewhere familiar,

493
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,700
I wanna know where the exits are
and I wanna be allowed to smoke.

494
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,000
OK...

497
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,100

Perfik.

501
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,600
No, wait, we can't bring them back here.

502
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,400
- Why not?
- It's not exactly safe, is it?

503
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,500
Yeah. Look at the state of it.

504
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,200
Where's safe? Where's familiar?

505
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,000
Where can I smoke?

506

How's that for a slice of fried gold?

510
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah, boy!

Do you believe everything you hear on TV?

515

Yeah, I can see it, it's just outside.

516

Any zombies out there?

517
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,400
- Don't say that.
- What?

518
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,400
- That.
- What?

519
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,900
That. The Z word. Don't say it.

520
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,500
- Why not?
- Because it's ridiculous.

521
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,100
All right. Are there any out there, though?

522
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,500
Can't see any.
Maybe it's not as bad as all that.

523
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,700
Oh! No, there they are.

524
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,200
- OK, let's do this, yeah?
- Yeah?

525
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,500
Yeah! I got to do a wee first.

526
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Ooh... can I drive?

527
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,200
What?

528
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,100
I always wanted to drive Pete's car.
I might not get another chance.

529
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,800
OK.

530
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,600
Ahh! Oh, God.

531
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,900
Sorry, Pete. Listen, we're gonna
borrow your car, OK?

532
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Erm, we'll bring it back.

533
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,300
And if you're feeling better later,
we're... we're going to the pub.

534
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,900
You're more than welcome to, er...

535
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,400
join us.

536
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,300
Pete'd be so pissed off
if he knew I was driving his car.

537
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,800
I don't think so.

538
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,100
Shaun, which button's central locking?

539
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,900
Oh, cock it!

540
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,200
Get lost!

541
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,100
Drive.

Hello?

554

- He's gonna be dead either way.
- That's not the point.

Oh, thank God for that.

556

Ah, hello.

557

Who's a pretty boy then?

558
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,600
You didn't say Barbara had a Jag.
I've always wanted to drive a Jag.

559
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,200
It's Philip's. He won't let anybody near it.

I put a Mars Bar in it once
and he chased me with a bit of wood.

- Fuck, it's gorgeous.
- It seems pretty clear, we should go.

Why don't I stay here?

What, what, what, what, what?

564
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,500
You know, just look after the car.
If there's any problems...

565
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
I'll honk three times.

566
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,900
OK.

567
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,700
Don't forget to kill Philip!

568
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,200
- Hello, pickle.
- Hi, Mum.

569
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,800
You've got red on you.

570
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah. Mum, is everything OK?
Are you all right?

571
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,500
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Where's Philip?

572
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,900
- Dad's in the lounge.
- He's not my dad.

573
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,400
Really!

574
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,900
Ed's outside,
we'll take you somewhere safe.

575
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,000
- What about the doctor?
- I don't think he's gonna come.

576
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,000
- Philip won't want to leave the house.
- Philip isn't...

577
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,100
Put the kettle on and I'll deal with Philip.

578
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,000
- OK.
- OK, then.

579
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,800
- You hungry?
- Not really.

580
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,300
- I'll make some sandwiches.
- OK.

- Why?

- What have you done now?
- Nothing.

- No. Yes.

Your toys are upstairs.
I was going to give them to the jumble.

- I took them all to the tip, Barbara.
- What?

594
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,300
- Shaun wants to take us somewhere.
- Don't be silly.

595
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,100
Maybe you should stay here
and wait for the doctor.

596
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,500
- You said he wasn't coming.
- You didn't call the doctor?

597
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,400
- Just to be on the safe side.
- I'm fine. I ran it under a cold tap.

we went to the Isle of Wight.

- It's overblown nonsense.

- A lot of drug nuts running wild.
- But I should get Mum away.

601
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,100
- I'm not going anywhere without Philip.
- Mum, look!

602
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,100
How about that tea?

603
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:54,000
Mum, how much do you love Philip?

604
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,900
- Two sugars, is it?
- I haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982.

605
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,400
Oh, yes. Will you cut me some bread, love?

606
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,800
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?

607
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,500
Do we have to go through all that again?

608
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,600
What would you say if I told you
that Philip's been quite unkind to me?

609
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,800
You weren't easy to live with.

610
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,300
- He chased me with a bit of wood!
- You did call him a you-know-what.

611
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,400
- Did he tell you that? Motherfucker.
- Shaun!

612
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,500
Sorry, Mother... Mum!

613
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,100
Did you know that on several occasions...
he touched me?

614
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,100
That wasn't true.
Made it up, shouldn't have, sorry.

615
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,500
- You don't understand...
- No, you don't understand.

616
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,500
Philip is my husband
and has been for 17 years

617
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,100
and I would at least expect you
to respect my feelings.

618
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,000
You must be more adult about these things.

619
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah.

620
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,100
Come on, Shaun.
There comes a time when...

621
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,700
you just...

622
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
gotta be a man.

623
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,700
I'm telling you, it's a fuss over nothing.

624
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,700
Hello, Edward.

625
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,200
- Hi, Barbara.
- My, how you've grown.

626
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,700
You better believe it.
What happened? Why is he coming?

627
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,400
- It wasn't as easy as all that.
- Are we following you?

628
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,100
No, it's probably best if we...
Where's the car?

629
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,200
Hmm... I pranged it.

630
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,900
You were parked.

631
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,800
Yeah.

632
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,400
I guess we'll have to take the Jag.

633
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,200
- Philip?
- What?

634
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
Look out!

635
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,000
Christ!

636
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,100
- Give me the car keys!
- You're not driving that car.

637
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,300
Give me the car keys!
Ed, get Mum in the car.

638
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,700
I'm on it.

639
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,700
Don't worry about me.
Worry about your mother.

640
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,000
- Maybe I should drive.
- I've adjusted the seat now.

641
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,000
Just be careful!

642
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,500
Can you please turn that noise down?

643
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,500
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?

644
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,900
I'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket.

645
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,200
- It is a bit loud.
- Sorry, Barbara.

646
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,400
You do realise this is
a 20 mile an hour zone?

647
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,100
Oh, yeah.

648
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,600
- Here.
- Mum, this won't take a second, all right?

649
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,300
- Have you still got the child locks on?
- Safety first, Shaun.

650
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
You can't...

651
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,500
Hey, man, watch the leather.

652
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,800
Keep moving. If there's any problems...

653
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,200
I'll do the honks.

654
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
'Hello? '

655
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,900
Hello?

656
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,700
- Guys, can you let me in?
- What are you doing?

657
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,600
I've come to get you.

658
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,700
- What are you doing?
- I've come to take you somewhere safe.

659
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,000
- We were safe!
- You don't know that.

660
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,100
There was two of them out there.
How many are there now?

661
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,500
- Lots.
- Lots!

662
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,500
It only takes one of them
to know you're in here.

663
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,200
I tried calling but I couldn't get through.
I had to come up with a plan.

664
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,800
- Oh, you made a plan?
- We have to get out of here.

665
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,500
If we don't, they'll tear us to pieces.

666
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,400
And that will exacerbate things for all of us.

667
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,400
- Shaun...
- This is not about you and me.

668
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,500
This is about survival.

669
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,500
We need to be somewhere more secure,
somewhere we can stay alive.

670
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,800
- We're with you, Shaun.
- What?

671
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,600
- We're with you.
- I'm not going out there.

672
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:03,300
Daffs! I don't want to be torn to pieces
and if you think about it, neither do you.

673
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,200
- I'm not going if Lizzie's not going.
- She's going.

674
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,400
- I'm not staying by myself.
- You're going, aren't you?

675
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
- Lizzie?
- Liz?

676
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,600
- All right, Flash, what's your plan?
- Great. I've got a car

677
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,400
but it's gonna be a bit cramped now.
Has anyone got transport?

678
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,500
- Yes!
- Great. Where?

679
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,400
Oh, no. Well, I've passed my test.

680
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,800
David?

681
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,400
I don't see the point
of owning a car in London.

682
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,100
Look, just get any blunt objects together.

683
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,000
If you get cornered,
bash them in the head.

684
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,800
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.

685
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,300
So, what's the plan, then?

686
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,800
We're going to the Winchester.

687
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,600
OK? Let's go.

688
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,900
- Come on.
- Where's the car?

689
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,600
What's up, niggaz?

690
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,300
Apologies for the cramped conditions.
Di, stay on David's lap.

691
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,500
Philip, hang in there, OK?
Ed, get there fast.

692
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,800
And, Mum, this is Liz. Liz, Mum.

693
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,800
Hello.

694
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,300
Ed, be careful.

695
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,400
- Is your dad all right?
- He's not my dad.

696
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,000
- He's bleeding.
- I know! Ed, be careful.

697
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,700
Thought you wanted to get there fast?

698
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,400
I want to get there in one piece!
Why are we going this way?

699
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
Chill out, it's a short cut.

700
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,600
- That road goes to the Winchester.
- Shaun...

701
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,900
- Liz, please!
- I don't understand why the Winchester?

702
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,200
- It's a pub, it's safe, it's secure.
- They know us.

703
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,300
- What makes it so secure?
- It's got big heavy doors and deadbolts.

704
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,300
And there's a rifle above the bar.

705
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:16,000
- I would think that's deactivated.
- It's not. John's connected. Big Al says so.

706
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,100
Big Al also says dogs can't look up.

707
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,700
- They can't.
- Can't they?

708
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,900
- Of course they can!
- Are you sure?

709
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,400
Yes! The pub is the right place to go.
Everything is gonna be fine.

710
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,900
- Shaun...
- I turned it off, all right?

711
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,200
What?

712
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,500
- Being a father, it's not easy.
- What?

713
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,500
You were 12 when I met you,
you'd already grown up so much.

714
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:44,500
I just wanted you to be strong
and not give up because you lost your dad.

715
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:51,200
- Philip, you don't have to explain.
- No, I do. I always loved you, Shaun.

716
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,000
And I always thought
you had it in you to do well.

717
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,400
You just need... m-motivation.

718
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,100
Somebody to look up to and...

719
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,200
I thought it could be me.

720
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,700
Would you just... take care of your mum?

721
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
There's a good boy.

722
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,000
- Ed, can you pull over?
- Two seconds.

723
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,400
- Ah! Ed, please pull over.
- What for?

724
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,300
- Just pull over!
- All right.

725
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,500
Whoa, momma!

726
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,000
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out. Everyone's all right.

727
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,200
Stop telling me to chill out!

728
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,700
- And everybody is not all right.
- What's wrong?

729
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,400
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.

730
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,100
- Where's he gone?
- Mum, he's dead.

731
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,400
No, he isn't.

732
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,400
Get out!

733
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,200
Jesus!

734
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,500
- Get it open!
- Ed, get the child locks!

735
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,600
Quick!

736
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,100
- The child lock!
- Ed!

737
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
- Now what?
- We keep moving.

738
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,800
- How do we get Philip out the car?
- We haven't got time.

739
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,600
- We can't leave your dad.
- He's not my dad!

740
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,700
Mum, he was, but he's not any more.

741
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,100
- I really think we could...
- That's not your husband in there. OK?

742
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,600
It looks like him but there is nothing
of the man you loved in that car.

743
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,100
Let's go, shall we?

744
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,500
You're not suggesting we walk?

745
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,300
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah, we're having a whale of a time.

746
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,900
Maybe we should all hold hands,
make a crocodile?

747
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,100
Do you know where we're going?

748
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,500
- David, come on.
- Sorry.

749
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,000
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally.

750
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,800
Are we close?

751
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,800
We're pretty close.

752
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,900
- Is your mum gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I hope so.

753
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,800
- Did you contact your folks?
- They're in Antigua.

754
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,800
- Do you think this is happening there?
- I hope not.

755
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,900
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...

756
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,800
- You said this wasn't about us.
- No, it's not.

757
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,800
- You said it was about survival.
- It is, but...

758
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,100
You're notjust trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.

759
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,800
- Maybe this isn't the best time to talk.
- OK.

760
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,600
Shaun.

761
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,100
Yvonne.

762
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,900
- How's it going?
- Er, surviving.

763
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,500
Hey, Liz. Long time no see.

764
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,300
Hey, Yvonne.

765
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,200
Erm... this is my boyfriend, Declan.

766
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,300
Erm... my friends Mark, Maggie,

767
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,800
- my mum and my cousin Tom.
- All right.

768
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,500
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.

769
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,500
- They've split up, actually.
- Oh, really?

770
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,800
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

771
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,800
We should scoot.
Have you got somewhere you're going?

772
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,400
- Yeah, we're going to the Winchester.
- The pub?

773
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,000
- Yeah.
- Right, well. Good luck!

774
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,800
Hi.

775
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,400
Hello.

776
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,500
Hi.

777
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,400
Hello.

778
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,000
All right.

779
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,300
See? The Winchester's just over there.

780
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,700
- Over where?
- Over there.

781
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,300
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?

782
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,200
What's the matter, David?

783
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,900
Never taken a short cut before?

784
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,400
Shaun.

785
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,300
I'm sure Jill and Derek live round here.

786
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,400
Now, the Winchester
is just over that fence, all right?

787
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,700
Everyone stay where they are, I'll...
Are we all here?

788
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,500
- One, two, three, four, five. Yes.
- There's six of us.

789
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,800
Mum!

790
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,600
I'm coming!

791
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,300
Mum, are you OK? Are you OK?

792
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,200
I don't think Jill and Derek do live here.

793
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,600
Shaun?

794
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,800
Are you all right?

795
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,900
What are you doing?

796
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,100
Shaun!

797
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,000
Yes!

798
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,800
No, that's rubbish.

799
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,500
- Ooh!
- Yes!

800
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,500
Feel free to step in any time.

801
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,700
- You did all right.
- I didn't want to cramp your style.

802
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm so sorry about that.

803
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,900
Right.

804
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,900
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I'm gonna check if the coast is clear.

805
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,900
- Is it clear?
- No.

806
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,100
- How many?
- Lots.

807
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,300
Oh, well, that is just great.

808
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,600
There are a fair few of them, yes.

809
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,900
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme
up his sleeve?

810
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,300
This is hardly constructive, David!

811
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,100
- We should have stayed at the flat.
- Why didn't you?

812
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,400
Because... Because, because of...
Captain Wow.

813
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,000
- Will you stop it?
- We'll get nowhere moaning.

814
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,600
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber.

815
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,200
Or not.

816
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,700
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.

817
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,300
Almost like sleepwalking. Look at the face,
it's vacant with a hint of sadness.

818
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,700
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

819
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,800
OK, let's try, shall we? Liz.

820
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:36,700
Nice. Good vocal work.
OK. Barbara, that's excellent.

821
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,400
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

822
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,100
- D-Daffs.
- Uh.

823
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,200
- Come on!
- Urgh.

824
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,600
It's mournful, sorrowful,
you're dead and you hate it. Go.

825
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,500
Uuurgh.

826
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,400
- Much better. Ed.
- I'll do it on the night.

827
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,900
This is the night!

828
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,400
- What is that?
- What about yours?

829
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,400
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?

830
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,100
Don't...

831
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,800
Yeah, that's pretty good.

832
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:12,600
Right, let's all try together, shall we?
One, two, three.

833
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,000
Go, go, go, go.

834
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,700
Shit! Get round me, get round me!

835
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:18,200
John? John, Bernie, are you there?
It's Shaun and Ed. We come in all the time.

836
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,400
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.

837
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,000
- They know.
- Stay in character!

838
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,300
- I can't see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.

839
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,900
- Break the window.
- We'll be exposed!

840
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,800
- Break the window!
- Is there another way in?

841
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,900
Yeah, there's...

842
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,300
Two seconds. Hey, Noodle.

843
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,200
- 'All right? '
- Yeah, man, I can't talk now.

844
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,100
- 'You get anything yet? '
- I got nothing.

845
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:46,100
I'm in the middle of something.
Yeah, it's weird.

846
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,900
- Oi! What are you doing?
- What are you doing? You stupid moron.

847
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,700
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off!

848
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,200
Fuck fucking off! I've spent an entire life...

849
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,500
Look at me. I've spent my entire life
sticking up for you

850
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,900
and all you ever do is fuck things up
and make me look stupid.

851
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I'm not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!

852
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,100
Shaun.

853
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,400
Oh.

854
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,600
You were saying about another way in?

855
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,800
Yeah, there's a...

856
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,500
What are you doing?

857
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,800
- No!
- Get inside.

858
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:32,700
No, they'll follow us.
Keep up the act, I'll have to do something.

859
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,700
- What do you mean do something?
- Hello, hello, over here!

860
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,900
Come on, that's it.
Come on, that's it, over here!

861
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,100
Over here! Come on. Oh, bollocks.

862
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,100
- Wait till I've gone then get inside.
- Gone where?

863
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:52,800
I won't be long, I promise. Come on,
you pasty-faced fuckers, let's go! Follow me.

864
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,400
Come on, this way, that's it!

865
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,400
Come on. This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.

866
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,000
Come and get it. It's a running buffet.

867
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,300
All you can eat!

868
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Shall we go in, then?

869
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:20,100
- Come on, Barbara. Leave those.
- I think they're for me.

870
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,800
- He's been gone a good 20 minutes.
- 17.

871
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,400
Either way, we need to think about blocking
up this window. We're totally exposed.

872
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,100
- How will Shaun get back in?
- I'm sure he'll knock.

873
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,700
- Let's get some lights on.
- David, wait!

874
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,700
- Power's off.
- That's a good thing.

875
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,100
- We mustn't advertise our whereabouts.
- No, of course not.

876
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,200
- Do we, David?
- No, of course not, Lizzie.

877
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,300
I'm just being proactive.

878
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,600
There's no lights, no power.
And there's a hole in the window.

879
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,400
- You did that, you twat.
- Somebody had to do something!

880
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,300
We were in a spot of bother. Somebody
has to take control of the situation

881
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,700
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

882
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
then perhaps... I should.

883
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,400
- Will Shaun be gone long?
- He'll be back soon.

884
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,400
- How do you know?
- I don't think he'd leave us.

885
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:42,600
Wouldn't he? How can you trust a man
you binned for being unreliable?

886
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:47,300
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot
is also an impenetrable fortress.

887
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,500
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?

888
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,300
I could get a round in.

889
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,000
Let's just wait for Shaun. We'll barricade
the window when he gets back.

890
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,100
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?

891
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:02,400
- What are we going to eat?
- Toasties!

892
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,000
- There's a Breville out back.
- Great. Saved by nibbles.

893
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,500
Must be why Shaun took us here
before he left.

894
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,600
- He's coming back!
- Why? Because he promised?

895
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:17,700
If he does, do you think his master plan
will be anything more than eating peanuts?

896
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Is he just gonna stroll in
and suddenly everything's OK?

897
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,500
I don't know, David!
I don't know any more than you do.

898
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,200
But what I do know is that we're here now
and we have to make the best of it.

899
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,900
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
- Right you are.

900
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:38,100
I'll have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?

901
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,400
- Hello.
- Right, great, fuck it.

902
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:44,000
We'll have a party
and get completely smashed.

903
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,800
We've got our nibbles.
We've got our Mini Cheddars.

904
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,400
- David!
- We got Twiglets. Oh, look, hog lumps.

905
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,500
Pickle!

906
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,200
Hello, Mum. You all right?

907
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,400
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

908
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,700
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- No.

909
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,000
- Check upstairs?
- It's locked.

910
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,600
- Phones?
- Dead. Same as the power.

911
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:13,600
- OK...
- Nice of you to join us.

912
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,200
Yeah, well, I promised, didn't I?

913
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,900
How did you lose them?

914
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,200
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn't difficult. They're not all that.

915
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,000
- Well, how did you get in?
- The back door.

916
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,500
I tried to tell you
before you smashed the window.

917
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,900
But it wasn't me blowing our cover
by arguing with my boyfriend.

918
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,800
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.

919
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,000
Thanks, babe.

920
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,500
So, what's the plan, then?

921
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,200
Would anyone like a peanut?

922
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,400
Why don't you do your Clyde?

923
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,500
Has anyone seen
Every Which Way But Loose?

924
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,500
Ed does the most amazing
impression of the orang-utan.

925
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,200
- No, it's not.
- It is. Come on. Do it.

926
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,100
- No, no.
- But it's brilliant. Come on.

927
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,200
- You've built it up too much.
- No, just do it.

928
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,300
Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.

929
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,900
Do it, do it, do it, do it. Come on, do it.

930
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,100
I'm not a performing monkey.

931
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,900
- The power's on.
- It's not, I tried it earlier.

932
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,800
The streetlights are on.
I'll flip the fuses, we can watch television.

933
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,700
- What about the lights?
- Yes. Don't advertise our whereabouts.

934
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:45,600
The lights are on a separate circuit.
Just flip the mains breakers.

935
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,100
It's quite simple, David.

936
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,600
- Is that it?
- That's it.

937
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,300
Liz, erm... have you got a quid?

938
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,400
Erm...

939
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,000
Yeah.

940
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,800
Never anything on, is there?

941
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,200
What?

942
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:14,200
- I think we might have a bit of a problem.
- What do you mean?

943
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:22,000
- They followed me.
- I thought you said you gave them the slip.

944
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,600
Yeah.

945
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,000
Well, we'll just have to be
extra quiet then, won't we?

946
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,700
What?

947
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,000
Ed, no!

948
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,200
Turn it off!

949
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,500
Shit!

950
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,300
- Where the hell did he come from?
- I dunno.

951
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,300
- Who put this on?
- It's on random.

952
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,500
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.

953
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,400
- What?!
- The jukebox!

954
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,100
- Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
- What about the rifle?

955
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,300
- Cocktails?
- What do you mean?

956
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,800
The flaming spirits
Get a rag in, light it.

957
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?

958
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,000
How about pool?

959
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,300
# Don't stop me now

960
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,400
# Don't stop me

961
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,600
- # Cos I'm having... #
- John, it's time at the bar.

962
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,500
# I'm a shooting star
leaping through the sky like a tiger

963
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,200
# Defying the laws of gravity

964
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,400
# I'm a racing car passing by
like Lady Godiva

965
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,000
# I'm gonna go, go, go

966
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,600
# There's no stopping me

967
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,000
# I'm burning through the sky...

968
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,900
- I can't find the switches!
- Then get the fuses!

969
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,400
# That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit

970
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,500
# I'm travelling at the speed of light

971
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:20,400
# I wanna make
a supersonic man out of you

972
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,700
# Don't stop me now

973
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,900
# I'm having such a good time

974
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,000
# I'm having a ball

975
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,000
# Don't stop me now

976
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,100
# If you wanna have a good time

977
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,100
# Just give me a call

978
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,700
# Don't stop me now
cos I'm having a good time

979
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,700
# Don't stop me now

980
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:43,300
# Yes I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

981
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,500
- # I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars...
- Why is Queen still on?

982
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,100
- We have a situation!
- I know!

983
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,500
- Fuck this. Two seconds.
- Ed!

984
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,200
Oi!

985
01:12:55,300 --> 01:13:00,000
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

986
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,200
# I'm burning through the sky, yeah...

987
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,100
Shaun!

988
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,300
#... call me Mister Fahrenheit...

989
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,900
No!

990
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,100
Yes! Yes! In the head!

991
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,900
Ooow!

992
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,400
Shauny!

993
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,600
# Don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh

994
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,600
# Don't stop me, don't stop me
good time, good time

995
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,700
# Don't stop me... #

996
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,700
Why didn't you just shoot him, man?

997
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,400
Ed, for the last time, it's...

998
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:49,100
I fucking knew it!
What did I tell you? Big Al was right.

999
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,200
OK.

1000
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,800
But dogs can look up.

1001
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:02,100
- Has anyone fired a gun before?
- Oh, yeah.

1002
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,600
- Apart from Ed?
- I'm a pacifist.

1003
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,400
- Apart from David and Ed?
- What was Ed's experience?

1004
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,800
- He shot his sister in the leg.
- I think you should do it.

1005
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,100
- We should all do it.
- How can five people operate one gun?

1006
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,000
- No one has any experience. We've got...
- 29.

1007
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,200
- 29 bullets.
- Call them shells.

1008
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,300
29 shells. I need someone
to help me reload,

1009
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,000
everyone else to look out. I will fire.

1010
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:29,900
As Bertrand Russell said the only thing
that will redeem mankind is co-operation.

1011
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,300
I think we can all appreciate that now.

1012
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,900
- Was that on a beer mat?
- Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.

1013
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,900
- I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1014
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,700
- They want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.

1015
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,400
David, Dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

1016
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,000
- Barbara.
- Oh, hello.

1017
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,100
- Would you like to come with me?
- That'd be lovely.

1018
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,700
It's nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun's always talking about you.

1019
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

1020
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,000
- Ah!
- Barbara?

1021
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,100
Are you all right?

1022
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,000
I've got something for you.

1023
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,800
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

1024
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,500
- I'd like you to have it.
- Barbara, Shaun and I have...

1025
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,500
It seems only right.

1026
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,900
I didn't want to say anything.

1027
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,100
I thought Shaun would be worried.

1028
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,700
Liz!

1029
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,500
Here they come!

1030
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,200
- Stay behind me!
- There's one!

1031
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,700
Sorry, we're closed!

1032
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,100
- The safety!
- That happened to me on stage.

1033
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,300
Cock it!

1034
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,100
- There!
- Where?

1035
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,200
Three o'clock!

1036
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,100
- Oh! Over there again. Quarter to twelve.
- What?

1037
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,400
- 11:45!
- Keep it simple!

1038
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,400
Top left!

1039
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,800
- Reload.
- I'm on it!

1040
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,900
Come on, come on.

1041
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,200
Nice shot.

1042
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,900
OK, David, Dianne,
let's block up this window!

1043
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,100
Ed, take over a sec.

1044
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,800
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Shaun, I'm so sorry.

1045
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,400
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

1046
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,700
- Mum, what's wrong?
- I didn't want to be a bother.

1047
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,000
- Mum, I don't understand.
- The man in his pyjamas.

1048
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,300
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

1049
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,500
No, you should've said.

1050
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,700
- Take over a sec.
- What's going on?

1051
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,200
- What's up?
- What the hell's going on?

1052
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,500
- Barbara's hurt!
- Just take over a minute.

1053
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,600
Jesus.

1054
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,600
I know first aid.

1055
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,600
Just hang on. Mum!

1056
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,300
- Mum.
- Is she...?

1057
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,600
Just hold on, Mum, you're gonna be fine.

1058
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,800
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

1059
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,000
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

1060
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,800
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?

1061
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,700
Oh, no, no! Mum, come on.

1062
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,100
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1063
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,500
Mum. Please don't go.

1064
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:57,000
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.

1065
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,600
- Daffs!
- For Christ's sake!

1066
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,100
- She's gonna come back!
- She's not going anywhere.

1067
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,600
- She'll change.
- She's my mum!

1068
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,400
- She's a zombie.
- Don't say that.

1069
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,800
Move aside. I'm gonna count to three.

1070
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,900
One...

1071
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,400
two...

1072
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,800
three!

1073
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,500
- Don't point that gun at my mum!
- Calm down.

1074
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,100
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

1075
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,600
- Ed, don't exacerbate things!
- What's that mean?

1076
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,000
- This isn't exactly fair.
- Here.

1077
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,900
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

1078
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,100
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?

1079
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,100
Tell him to put the gun down!

1080
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,400
She's gonna change. You know I'm right.

1081
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:41,700
And when she does, she'll kill all of us.
That's what your ex can't seem to realise.

1082
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,000
That's what this is about, isn't it?
He doesn't like me!

1083
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,600
He's always hated me
and now he wants to shoot my mum.

1084
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:51,300
- She's not...
- You've never thought I was good enough.

1085
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,700
- What?
- We all know you're in love with Liz.

1086
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,200
- That is not true.
- Yes it is!

1087
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,300
- That is not true.
- Yes it is.

1088
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,000
- What?
- I know you only hung out with me

1089
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:07,000
to get close to Liz and when she knocked
you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.

1090
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:10,800
I've come to terms with that, Daffs,
why can't you?

1091
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,300
Lizzie, I want you to know
that my feelings for you...

1092
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,400
David! There are slightly more
pressing matters at hand here.

1093
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,700
- Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
- I'm not being unreasonable, "Pickle".

1094
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,900
- Christ, she's not dead!
- She's finished.

1095
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite.

1096
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,800
You've gone from
a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.

1097
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,700
I'm not a chartered accountant.

1098
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,000
- Well, you look like one.
- Yeah.

1099
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,000
- I'm a lecturer.
- You're a twat.

1100
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,700
She's not your mum.
In a minute she'll be just another zombie.

1101
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,000
- Don't say that.
- We're not using the Z word.

1102
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,000
Please can we just calm the fuck down!

1103
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:54,200
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...

1104
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,500
- Thank you.
- Even if he is being a twat.

1105
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,400
Yep.

1106
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,400
And, Shaun... Shaun, look at me.

1107
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,700
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you

1108
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,300
but we can't afford to fall apart.

1109
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,200
Shaun, babe...

1110
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,400
I know you don't wanna hear this...

1111
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,800
You do it.

1112
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,900
I'm sorry, Mum.

1113
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,700
Do it!

1114
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:13,100
Well... I think we're all agreed,
you did the right thing there.

1115
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,200
David, no!

1116
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,400
David!

1117
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,100
- Right, I'm leaving.
- What?

1118
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,700
- I'm not staying here.
- David, it's suicide.

1119
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,900
- I think you should go.
- We will. We can defend ourselves.

1120
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,400
- What do you mean "we"?
- What do you mean?

1121
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,300
Opening that door now
would be a very silly thing to do.

1122
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,800
- You gonna stay here with him?
- Look...

1123
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,200
- After where he led us?
- Let me finish!

1124
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:49,300
Shaun didn't ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.

1125
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,100
- Get away from that door this instant!
- But...

1126
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,100
David!

1127
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,700
I'm so sorry, Dianne.

1128
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,700
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.

1129
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,300
Shaun...

1130
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,400
David! No!

1131
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,800
No! No! No!

1132
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,500
David!

1133
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,200
- No! No!
- David!

1134
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,300
David!

1135
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,700
Dianne, no!

1136
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,400
I'm coming, David!

1137
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,100
David!

1138
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,100
Oh dear.

1139
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,300
- Cocktails?
- Do it.

1140
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,000
Stay back!

1141
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,000
Shaun, hold them!

1142
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,000
Heads!

1143
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,800
- Ed!
- Hurry up!

1144
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:40,000
Shauny, look who it is.

1145
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,600
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

1146
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,800
Ed!

1147
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,800
- Shaun!
- Ed!

1148
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,900
Don't groan at me, you thick fuck!

1149
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,800
I can't hold them!

1150
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,800
No!

1151
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,700
- Shaun!
- Pete!

1152
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,800
I said leave him alone!

1153
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,900
Ed. Ed!

1154
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Shaun, bar!

1155
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,000
Ed!

1156
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,800
Ed!

1157
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,000
Ed!

1158
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,000
What?

1159
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,300
Chuck us a cloth, will you?

1160
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,900
- Where are the shells?
- They're on the bar.

1161
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,500
Oh, fuck.

1162
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,900
Ow!

1163
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,500
Fuck it!

1164
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,500
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

1165
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,000
- The cellar.
- Maybe we can get out!

1166
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,900
- There's a hatch out on to the street.
- You mean go back outside?

1167
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,900
Oh, give us a fucking break!

1168
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,100
Go!

1169
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,900
I can see the street.

1170
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,400
Come on.

1171
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,800
Come on!

1172
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,400
Why won't it open?

1173
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,600
That's it then, we're trapped.
"Hey, let's go to the Winchester!"

1174
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,600
Whose fucking idea was that?

1175
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,400
Man, I've really ballsed this up.

1176
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,600
- No, you haven't.
- I have, Liz. I couldn't save us.

1177
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:15,300
I couldn't save Di or David.
I couldn't even save Mum. I'm useless.

1178
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:21,000
You shouldn't feel so responsible, you tried.
You did something, that's what counts.

1179
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,200
Yeah, I suppose.

1180
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,400
Do you think they'll get through?

1181
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,400
Yeah.

1182
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,100
How many shells have we got left?

1183
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:39,300
Erm... two.

1184
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:44,300
I suppose we could take a few of them out
if they stand in a line.

1185
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,700
I wasn't thinking about them.

1186
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,500
I know.

1187
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,100
- What about Ed? There's only two shells.
- I don't mind being eaten.

1188
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,400
How are we gonna do this?

1189
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,100
I don't know. Erm...

1190
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,300
One of us has to go first.

1191
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,500
One should do the other
and then do themselves.

1192
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,700
You should do me.
I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.

1193
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:28,100
I don't think I've got it in me
to shoot my flatmate,

1194
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:31,500
my mum and my girlfriend
all in the same evening.

1195
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,200
What makes you think I've taken you back?

1196
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,100
Well...

1197
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,500
you don't want to die single, do you?

1198
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:44,300
Actually... I would like to be shot.

1199
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,800
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag
since yesterday, I promise.

1200
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
He hasn't.

1201
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,000
Maybe we should have one now.

1202
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,400
- You left them in my flat.
- Yeah, in the bin.

1203
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,500
- I was desperate.
- Sneaky monkey.

1204
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,700
- Sorry.
- I won't say anything.

1205
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,600
Come on, we're getting out of here.

1206
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,500
- I mightjust stay here.
- But we can get out.

1207
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:31,100
- You two should make a go of it.
- What are you talking about?

1208
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:34,500
- I only hold you back.
- Yeah, but...

1209
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,500
Maybe you should have this.

1210
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,600
- Don't you want it?
- No.

1211
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:48,500
I can't hit anything with it anyway,
I'm rubbish.

1212
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,400
- Ed, I'm sorry.
- What for?

1213
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:00,300
- Cos I was shouting at you earlier on.
- It's all right.

1214
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,700
I'm sorry too.

1215
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,900
It's OK.

1216
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,600
No...

1217
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,700
I'm sorry, Shaun.

1218
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,800
Oh, God! That's not funny.

1219
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,700
- I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I'm not laughing.

1220
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,200
You'd better be off.

1221
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,200
Bye, Ed. Love you.

1222
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,800
Cheers.

1223
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,900
I love you too, man.

1224
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,100
Gay.

1225
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,400
- Ready?
- Ready.

1226
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,500
Section One. Ready.

1227
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,900
