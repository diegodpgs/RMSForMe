1
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:19,577
Hey, sheriff.

2
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:34,013
A Mercury is a real good car.

3
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,417
That was the car
I was driving that day.

4
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:43,261
I owned a lot of cars.

5
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,923
Yeah, different kinds.

6
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:50,730
A lot of different kinds of cars.

7
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:53,600
She was standing, this girl…

8
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,035
on the side of the street
by this chicken stand.

9
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,373
Not the Colonel’s,
a different chicken stand.

10
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:02,379
I pulled the Mercury up alongside…

11
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:05,746
and rolled down the window
by electric power.

12
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:10,254
And she had this leather skirt on…

13
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:13,552
and she had a lot of hair
on her arms.

14
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,822
I like that. It means a big bush,
which I like.

15
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:25,463
She says, “Are you dating?”
You know?

16
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,903
I said, “Sure.”
So she gets in…

17
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:31,670
and we pull off into…

18
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:35,110
this remote location
comfortable for both of us.

19
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,809
She says, “How much
do you want to spend?”

20
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:42,375
I said, “Enough to see
your bush. I know it’s big.”

21
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:44,887
She says, “$25.”

22
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:52,687
That’s not chicken feed
to a working man.

23
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:55,995
I produce the $25,
she sticks it in her shoe…

24
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,036
pulls up her skirt…

25
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:04,008
and there is thin, crooked,
uncircumcised penis.

26
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:12,648
You can imagine I wanted my $25 back.

27
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:19,348
Why are you weirded out?

28
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:22,484
It’s not San Quentin.
It’s a nut house.

29
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:25,621
Most patients don’t know where
they are. They won’t hurt you.

30
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:28,757
It doesn’t bother you we’ll be facing
a killer in a few minutes?

31
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:31,394
You wanted to major in journalism.

32
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,035
They’re from that newspaper deal.

33
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,671
– From the college?
– Yes, sir.

34
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:44,511
– I’m Jerry Woolridge.
– I’m Marsha Dwiggins.

35
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:47,414
She’s Theresa Evans.
She’s here to take pictures.

36
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:50,988
Y’all sit down.

37
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:56,052
A man named John Leggitt Hunter
had a filling station.

38
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,493
A good filling station business.

39
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:00,929
He was the type of person
that I’m sure you’ve met too…

40
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,933
who didn’t deserve what he had.

41
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:07,734
One thing he had was…

42
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:10,741
this beautiful, young bride,
Sarah.

43
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:14,644
She was a Georgia peach.

44
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:20,548
She was more like the picture I had
in my mind than any woman I’d seen.

45
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,918
So I took her away
from John Leggitt Hunter…

46
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:26,958
who did not deserve her.

47
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:30,085
Oh, I don’t know if I told you…

48
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:33,222
but he was a Frenchman
who claimed to be an Englishman.

49
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,167
Took strong nylon cord
to get her away from him.

50
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:42,968
She was a fighter and a Georgia peach.

51
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:50,210
There must have been a mix-up.

52
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,781
I talked to your sponsor,
teacher or whoever…

53
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:58,016
and told him no pictures.

54
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:02,219
This is for an article
or something, right?

55
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:07,020
Yeah, it’s for the school newspaper
which has pictures.

56
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:08,726
It’s a regular paper.

57
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,860
Karl’s real sensitive
about having his picture made.

58
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:15,304
He wouldn’t be on the bulletin board
for the Easter collage.

59
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,304
Now…

60
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,349
a shovel just makes
too goddamn much racket.

61
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,957
I’ll talk to him, see what he says.

62
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:41,364
You gotta make something explode
to truly understand it.

63
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:45,597
You gotta examine all those particles
while they’re still on fire.

64
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,631
Karl, let’s go down
to the old classroom.

65
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:53,701
Mr. Woolridge has some people
for you to see.

66
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,614
Let’s go.

67
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:19,528
Remember I told you about
those newspaper people?

68
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:22,698
They want to ask you questions
about your release.

69
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,675
They think it’ll make a good story.

70
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:28,679
Will you talk to them?
Get interviewed?

71
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:32,682
They’re women.

72
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:41,425
I think it’d be good for you. You’ll see
all kinds of people on the outside.

73
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,427
This’ll help.

74
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:55,634
Now, he’ll only talk to you
but you can’t ask him anything…

75
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,698
and don’t stare at him.

76
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,301
How can I interview him
if I can’t ask any questions?

77
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,608
Sorry, that’s the best it’s gonna get.

78
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:04,614
Can I ask you a question?

79
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,708
If he’s so troubled,
why are you letting him out?

80
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,617
What if he does it again?
It happens.

81
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:13,556
His time’s up.
That’s the rules.

82
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,992
He’s been treated, re-evaluated,
doesn’t show any signs any more.

83
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:19,792
– Signs?
– Homicidal signs.

84
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:25,132
Miss, I’m sorry,
but you’ll have to step outside.

85
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,671
– Why?
– Please?

86
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:41,083
I have to change
the light in here for Karl.

87
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,711
I hope you can still see to write.

88
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:29,227
I reckon what you want to know
is what I’m doing in here.

89
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:32,031
I reckon it’s because I killed somebody.

90
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,234
But I reckon you want to know
how come I killed somebody…

91
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,676
so I’ll start at the front
and tell you.

92
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:49,018
I lived out in back of
my parents’ place most of my life…

93
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:52,989
in a little old shed
that my daddy’d built for me.

94
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:57,392
They didn’t want me in the house
with the rest of them…

95
00:09:57,462 --> 00:10:00,989
so I sat around in the shed
looking at the ground.

96
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:06,069
I didn’t have no floor…

97
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:10,301
but I had me a hole dug out
to lay down in…

98
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,502
a quilt or two to put down there.

99
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,782
My father…

100
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:21,013
was a hard-working man
most of his life…

101
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:24,715
not that I can say the same
for myself.

102
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,155
I mostly just sat around
in the shed…

103
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:29,318
tinkered around
with a lawn mower or two…

104
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:34,225
went to school off and on
from time to time.

105
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:39,498
But the children out there,
they were very cruel to me…

106
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:44,008
and made quite a bit of sport of me,
made fun of me quite a bit.

107
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:49,308
So mostly I just sat around
out there in the shed.

108
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:55,212
My daddy…

109
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,187
worked at the sawmill,
down at the planer mill…

110
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:01,020
for an old man named Dixon.

111
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,686
Old man Dixon was a very cruel fellow.

112
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:07,198
Didn’t treat his employees well
or pay them well.

113
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:10,132
Didn’t pay my daddy too much of a wage.

114
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:12,761
Just barely enough to get by,
I reckon.

115
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,303
I reckon he got by all right.

116
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,735
They used to come out,
one or the other of them…

117
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,240
usually my mother…

118
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,545
feed me pretty regular.

119
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:31,816
So I know he made enough
so I could have mustard and biscuits…

120
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,289
three or four times a week.

121
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,120
But old man Dixon…

122
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,132
he had a boy…

123
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,932
name of Jesse Dixon.

124
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:49,701
Jesse was more cruel
than his daddy was.

125
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:53,301
He used to make
quite a bit of sport of me…

126
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:56,006
when I was down there
at the schoolhouse.

127
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:02,643
Used to take advantage of the girls
in the neighbourhood.

128
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,281
They used to say…

129
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:11,521
that my mother was a very pretty woman.

130
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:16,863
They said that quite a bit
when I’d be there at the schoolhouse.

131
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:21,963
I reckon you want me to get on with it
and tell you what happened.

132
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,974
So I reckon I’ll tell you.

133
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,607
I was setting out in the shed
one evening, not doing much…

134
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:31,204
just staring at the wall…

135
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:34,410
and waiting on my mother
to give me my Bible lesson.

136
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:41,417
I heard a commotion in the house…

137
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:45,121
so I run up on the screened-in porch
to look inside.

138
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:49,963
I looked in and seen my mother laying
on the floor without any clothes on.

139
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:58,608
I seen Jesse Dixon
laying on top of her.

140
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:04,240
He was having his way with her.

141
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,750
I just seen red.

142
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:15,690
I picked up a Kaiser blade that was
sitting by the door.

143
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,856
Some folks called it a sling blade.
I called it a Kaiser blade.

144
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:23,992
It’s got a long, wood handle,
kind of like an axe handle…

145
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,901
with a long blade shaped like a banana.

146
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,705
Sharp on one edge
and dull on the other.

147
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,470
It’s what the highway boys use
to cut down weeds and whatnot. Yeah.

148
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,317
I went in the house…

149
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:45,220
and I hit Jesse Dixon
upside the head with it…

150
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,224
knocked him off my mother.

151
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:51,789
I reckon that didn’t satisfy me…

152
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:56,223
so I hit him again in the neck
with the sharp edge…

153
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:59,930
and just plumb near cut his head off,
killed him.

154
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,108
My mother jumped up
and started hollering…

155
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:08,202
“What did you kill Jesse for?”

156
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,009
Well, come to find out…

157
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:14,108
my mother didn’t mind
what Jesse was doing to her.

158
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:19,655
That made me madder
than what Jesse’d made me…

159
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:22,090
so I took the Kaiser blade –

160
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,425
some folks called it a sling blade,
I called it a Kaiser blade –

161
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:30,567
and I hit my mother
upside the head with it.

162
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,196
Killed her.

163
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,005
Some folks has asked me…

164
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:46,015
if you had it to do over again,
would you do it the same way?

165
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:48,017
I reckon I would.

166
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,722
Anyhow, they put me in here…

167
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:54,815
and here I been
for a great, long while.

168
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,920
I’ve learned to read some.

169
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:03,258
Took me four years to read the Bible.

170
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:07,728
I reckon I understand
a great deal of it.

171
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:10,433
Wasn’t what I expected
in some places.

172
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,641
I’ve slept in a good bed
for a great, long while.

173
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:20,250
Now they’ve seen fit
to put me out of here.

174
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:22,912
They say they’re setting me free today.

175
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:28,982
I reckon that’s all you was
needing to know.

176
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,831
You want more details.
I reckon I can tell them.

177
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:38,096
I don’t know whether that’s enough
for your newspaper or not.

178
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,663
Will you ever kill again, Karl?

179
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:56,649
I don’t reckon I got no reason
to kill nobody.

180
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,299
– Where will he go?
– Anywhere he wants.

181
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,131
I think he’s going to Millsburg where
he’s from, about 20 miles from here.

182
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:17,334
– Will he be supervised?
– As much as anybody, I guess.

183
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:19,433
Y’all have a nice day, now.

184
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:23,112
I’ll get Melvin to walk y’all out.

185
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:30,017
Would you walk these girls out?

186
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,154
Thank you.

187
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:50,569
I reckon I’ll have to get used to
looking at pretty people.

188
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,575
Guess you will.

189
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:56,805
Reckon I’ll have to get used to them
looking at me too.

190
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:01,685
Better go get your things.

191
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,721
Ain’t got nothing but them books.

192
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,657
Better go get them.

193
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,694
All right, then.

194
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,741
All right, then.

195
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:52,013
Can I help you?

196
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:02,892
I was kinda wanting
something to eat.

197
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:05,026
Well, what would you like?

198
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:09,766
You got any biscuits in there?

199
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:13,275
No, this is a Frosty Cream.
We don’t serve biscuits.

200
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,278
We got a lot of other stuff.

201
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,906
What you got in there
that’s good to eat?

202
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:20,576
We got Big Chief Burgers,
Bongo Burgers…

203
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:24,178
Foot-longs, Corny Dogs,
Frosty Shakes, Creamy Bars.

204
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:27,281
Did you want me to go through
the whole list?

205
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:30,526
What do you like?

206
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:37,433
Well, the French fries are pretty good.

207
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:41,232
– French fried potatoes?
– Yep, French fries.

208
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:45,942
How much you want for them?

209
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,446
They’re 60 for medium
and 75 for large.

210
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,745
I reckon I’ll have me
some of the big ones.

211
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,947
All right.
One large French fries?

212
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:41,354
These darn things are heavy.

213
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:43,923
Hard to carry too.

214
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,629
– You got wash in there?
– Yeah.

215
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:51,431
Can’t your mama and daddy tend to it?

216
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:56,104
I got a mama but she’s at work
at Hoochy’s Dollar Store.

217
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,672
My daddy’s dead.
He got hit by a train.

218
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:05,117
How far you going
with them sacks full of wash?

219
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,123
Half a mile, I think.

220
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:11,692
I can help you tote it
if I don’t give out first.

221
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:14,162
Okay, but you don’t have to.

222
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,468
All right, then.

223
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:24,532
My name’s Frank Wheatley.
What’s yours?

224
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:26,872
Karl’s my name.

225
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:28,970
– What’s your last name?
– Childers.

226
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:33,376
What are all them books?

227
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,385
Oh, different ones.

228
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:37,921
One’s the Bible, one’s a book
on Christmas…

229
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:40,479
one’s on how to be a carpenter.

230
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,892
– Why do you carry them around?
– Ain’t got no place to set them down.

231
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:47,055
Don’t you live somewhere?

232
00:22:47,131 --> 00:22:50,032
Did live at the state hospital.

233
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:54,162
– Why?
– I killed some folks a while back.

234
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:57,502
They said I wasn’t right in the head so
they put me in the nervous hospital…

235
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:00,009
instead of putting me in jail.

236
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,671
– They let you out?
– Yeah.

237
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:06,308
– How come?
– They told me I was well.

238
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,410
Had to turn me loose.

239
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:12,820
– Are you well?
– I reckon I feel all right.

240
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:17,661
This here’s my house.

241
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:24,394
You don’t seem like you killed nobody.

242
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:26,766
We can just
set these bags on the porch.

243
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:28,736
All right, then.

244
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:47,247
You like to play football?

245
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:50,919
I never was no account at it,
never got picked out for it.

246
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:54,263
Me and the Barnett twins
and some boys…

247
00:23:54,331 --> 00:23:57,425
play at the junior high school field
all the time.

248
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:00,834
You want to play, come on over
’cause we ain’t no good either.

249
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:03,873
I’ll see you later.

250
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,875
All right, then.

251
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:03,190
Hon, you can’t just go in there.

252
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:06,900
What in the world are you doing here?

253
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:08,939
I want to come back and stay in here.

254
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:12,838
You can’t. You’re a free man.

255
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,777
They let you out so you can
do as you please.

256
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:18,508
I reckon I don’t care
about being a free man.

257
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:21,073
I don’t know how
to go about it.

258
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:23,085
You’ll have to learn.

259
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:25,348
It’ll take some time.

260
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:28,289
Don’t you have anybody
to help you out?

261
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,486
No, sir.

262
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:34,053
Your daddy was living there
last time I heard.

263
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:38,534
I guess he wouldn’t want to
help you out any, would he?

264
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,904
Sorry. I wasn’t thinking.

265
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:47,040
Don’t you have anybody?

266
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:52,208
No, sir. Never did know
too much of nobody down there.

267
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:54,511
Not to be helping me out,
no way.

268
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,421
Karl, the truth is…

269
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:04,421
I don’t know where they expect you
to go, what they expect you to do.

270
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:09,192
If I could, I’d let you come back here
and stay if you wanted to.

271
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:12,133
I’m just doing my job.

272
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:14,136
You follow me?

273
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,169
Listen, Karl, I know an old boy…

274
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:23,645
who’s got a fix-it shop deal
in Millsburg.

275
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,705
He used to go to church with me.

276
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:30,512
You’re good working on
small engines and things.

277
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:34,786
If I was to put my neck out
for you with him…

278
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:37,725
do you think you could work it
if he’ll hire you?

279
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,889
I’m pretty handy, I reckon,
on lawn mowers and whatnot.

280
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:46,937
I know you are.
I’ve seen it myself.

281
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:49,666
– Could you give it a try?
– I reckon.

282
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:54,906
Now I can’t promise
that he’ll hire you.

283
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:57,209
I’ll have to tell him
about your history.

284
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:02,008
I never was no good with history.

285
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,519
No. I mean your past.

286
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:09,416
Why you were in here.

287
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:13,295
Take you down first thing
in the morning.

288
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,297
You don’t have
anywhere to stay tonight at all?

289
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,493
No, sir.

290
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,868
It’s against the rules
for you to stay here.

291
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:25,033
If something happened,
I’d be liable.

292
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:32,308
I reckon I can walk around till
morning time, sit and read a book.

293
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:53,601
Karl, would you like
a muffin?

294
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,605
No, thank you.

295
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:02,744
So Jerry’s taking you
someplace else tomorrow.

296
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:06,716
I don’t know nobody named Jerry.

297
00:28:07,751 --> 00:28:10,117
That’s me, Karl. That’s my first name.

298
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:14,247
He’s carrying me to look for work
down in Millsburg…

299
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:16,292
where I was born.

300
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,830
Would you like some coffee?

301
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:25,028
Coffee makes me a mite nervous
when I drink it.

302
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,433
Daddy, can I go to bed?

303
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:30,530
Sure. You sleep
with your mama tonight.

304
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:33,576
I’m sleeping with your brother
so Karl can have your room.

305
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:35,134
Why?

306
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,571
Because he’s company.

307
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:53,353
– Karl, you up?
– Yes, sir.

308
00:28:58,102 --> 00:28:59,467
Didn’t you sleep?

309
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:02,300
You been sitting there
like that all night?

310
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:04,431
Yes, sir.

311
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,533
Come on. We’d better hit the road.

312
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:10,044
All right, then.

313
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:04,967
Jerry, how’s it going?

314
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:07,299
– Hey, Bill.
– Good to see you.

315
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:10,932
– Good to see you. How’s everyone doing?
– Pretty good.

316
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:13,704
Kids are driving me crazy, and Phyliss
is putting me in the poor house…

317
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:15,506
but I can’t complain otherwise.

318
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:18,514
Wouldn’t do any good anyway.
You know Scooter?

319
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:20,709
Don’t believe I do.
Good to meet you, Scooter.

320
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:23,116
How about you?

321
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:25,655
Well, this is the one I was
telling you about on the phone.

322
00:30:25,722 --> 00:30:29,590
If you get nervous, I’ll understand,
but I’m not going to lie to you.

323
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,787
He got into that trouble,
but he was young.

324
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:36,299
I remember. He cut them
to pieces, and one was his mama.

325
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:38,300
And that Dixon boy.

326
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:42,270
Hell, I always wanted to kill him.
He was an asshole.

327
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:44,398
I remember him too.

328
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:47,739
Kinda retarded or something
back in school.

329
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:51,872
Seems like he’s pretty
well-adjusted these days.

330
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:54,281
I don’t think he’d ever hurt anybody.

331
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:59,550
He don’t look much like he would.
And he can fix a small engine real good?

332
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:02,251
He’s a whiz. It’s all he’s done
since he was a kid.

333
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,523
– You scared of him, Scooter?
– No, I don’t guess so.

334
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:08,724
– Can he talk?
– Oh, yeah.

335
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,495
You say he can stay
out in the back?

336
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:13,536
Fine with me. If he steals anything…

337
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,629
I’ll take it out of your pocket.

338
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:19,301
He won’t steal. He’s a good old boy.
Keeps to himself.

339
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:22,573
I got a room full of work.
Scooter won’t do it.

340
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:26,015
Karl, come over here.

341
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,278
I want you to meet your new boss.

342
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:31,219
This is Bill Cox.
He runs the place.

343
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:33,950
Says you can work here,
stay out back.

344
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:37,493
– It’s good to know you, Karl.
– Thank you.

345
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:42,327
It’s minimum wage. There’s nothing back
there but an army cot and a toilet.

346
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,664
That’s fine. I’ll go to the car
and get your books.

347
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:47,704
All right, then.

348
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:53,843
They say you’re a whiz on fixing
lawn mowers and things.

349
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:59,314
I’ve tinkered around
on them a bit.

350
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:02,477
We order from the Frosty Cream
at lunch, usually.

351
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:05,020
We’ll buy you lunch
till you get on your feet.

352
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:08,653
I like them
French fried potatoes.

353
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:12,628
Yeah. Me too.

354
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:17,592
They make a good double meat burger.

355
00:32:31,114 --> 00:32:33,378
All right, then.
I’ll see y’all later.

356
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,908
Karl, you done good work.
They was right about you.

357
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:40,445
Scooter, he’s gonna knock you out of
a job if you’re not careful.

358
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:42,718
– I’ll see y’all tomorrow.
– Wait up.

359
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:44,760
I’ll leave with you and lock up.

360
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:51,362
There’s a blanket under the cot, soap
in the bathroom for cleaning up.

361
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:55,496
One more thing. The way we lock
these doors, you can’t get out at night.

362
00:32:55,572 --> 00:32:59,201
– Did you want to go anywhere?
– I don’t reckon.

363
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:03,076
If it works out, we’ll get you a key so
you can get out at night.

364
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:05,341
– I’ll see you later.
– All right, then.

365
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:32,408
Did I tell you the one about the two
old boys pissing off the bridge?

366
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:33,943
I don’t remember.

367
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:38,971
These two old boys hung their peckers
off a bridge to piss.

368
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:42,450
One was from California,
one from Arkansas.

369
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,682
Old boy from California says,
“Boy, this water’s cold.”

370
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:48,520
Old boy from Arkansas says,
“Yeah, and it’s deep too.”

371
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:53,758
Get it?

372
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,288
– Yeah, that’s a good one.
– That is a good one.

373
00:33:57,367 --> 00:34:01,861
I do believe you told me that before.
I’ve heard it a bunch.

374
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:06,136
– A long time ago.
– Yeah, that’s a classic.

375
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:11,579
Karl, I’ve been thinking, and it’s not
Christian of me to keep locking you in.

376
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:14,446
You’ve been in lockup so long,
you don’t need me to keep doing it.

377
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:17,009
You need to come and go as you please.
Here.

378
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:21,623
Take this key. It’ll get you
in and out of here at night.

379
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,426
All right, then.

380
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:32,066
– Them French fries good?
– They’s good, all right.

381
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:36,138
You got any money?

382
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:39,842
They give me some
when they turned me loose.

383
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:45,477
I spent some riding the bus,
eating French fried potatoes.

384
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:50,976
I’m going to pay you today
for this coming week…

385
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:53,579
so you have some walking-around money.

386
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:58,560
You need to buy some toothpaste and
cleaning up supplies to have back there.

387
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:02,120
Get you some magazines
and some hard candy…

388
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:05,827
something to keep you busy
at night.

389
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:07,904
All right, then.

390
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:10,303
I’ll let you off
while it’s still daylight.

391
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:47,266
I thought I heard somebody on the porch.
Wasn’t your name Karl?

392
00:35:48,945 --> 00:35:52,312
Yes, sir, it is.
You’re named Frank.

393
00:35:53,016 --> 00:35:56,349
Yeah. What are you doing by here?

394
00:35:56,419 --> 00:36:00,150
– You said for me to come by.
– Wanna play ball with us?

395
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:05,357
I ain’t no good at it.
I just come by to see you.

396
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:10,331
I was going to see my mama at Hoochy’s
Dollar Store. She works 2:00 to 8:00.

397
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:13,597
All right, then.

398
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,161
You want to go with me?
You can meet my mama.

399
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:20,832
I ought not worry your mama
with company.

400
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:24,937
Come on. You’ll like her.
She’s real nice.

401
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:28,746
She’ll give us anything we want her to,
candy or something.

402
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:33,422
I was needing to do some trading.

403
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,685
Reckon they sell toothpaste?

404
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:38,922
Yeah, they sell a little bit
of everything.

405
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:43,056
I won’t tell her about you being in
the state hospital for killing.

406
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,100
Come on. Let’s go.

407
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,185
You have to learn to live
without all that grease.

408
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:06,518
Here in the South,
I like grease in everything.

409
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,253
I like fried chicken, fried okra,
biscuits and gravy.

410
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,124
– It will kill you.
– Hey, Mama, Vaughan.

411
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,629
– What you up to, sweetheart?
– I bet I know.

412
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:17,428
– You want candy and pop, right?
– Yeah.

413
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,799
That rots your teeth.
I’ve got something better.

414
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,338
Potted meat is on special –
four cans for a dollar.

415
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:28,901
They’re not selling but I’ll give
the right kid some for free.

416
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:30,913
I don’t like potted meat.

417
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:34,348
Daddy said it was made from lips,
peckers and intestines.

418
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:38,615
Don’t talk that way. Did that
strange-looking man follow you in here?

419
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:41,856
Can I help you?

420
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:46,154
That’s Karl. I met him
at the laundry mat.

421
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:48,891
Karl, this is Mama and Vaughan.

422
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,058
Vaughan is the manager.

423
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:55,365
He lets Mama off work anytime
because they’re best friends.

424
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:57,372
Nice to meet you, Karl.

425
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:00,799
Pleased to meet you.

426
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:07,515
Frank, come back here with me
for a minute.

427
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:15,381
I haven’t seen you here before.

428
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,719
No, sir, I don’t reckon you have.
I haven’t been in here before.

429
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,266
This store didn’t used to be here.

430
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:28,701
It’s been here 17 years.
Did you live here before?

431
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:31,673
I was born and raised here till
I was 12 years old.

432
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:36,342
– What brings you back?
– What’s that you say?

433
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:41,407
Why are you here now?

434
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:44,351
They turned me loose from
the state hospital.

435
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:49,085
Is that right?
How long are you staying?

436
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:53,687
Mr. Woolridge got me hired
at Bill Cox’s outfit.

437
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:57,697
– You have family here?
– Not to speak of.

438
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:02,397
Hey, Karl. Guess what?
Mama said you can stay in our garage.

439
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:05,702
Our car doesn’t fit anyway.
It’s real neat.

440
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:09,370
Frank told me about your situation.
Frank loves company.

441
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:11,914
Especially after his daddy passed
and all.

442
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:15,473
There’s no sense in you staying
in that greasy old shop.

443
00:39:15,552 --> 00:39:17,816
He’s mentally retarded,
poor thing.

444
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:20,651
– He just go out of the state hospital.
– I know.

445
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:23,386
– Can we get some candy and pop?
– Sure. Go ahead.

446
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,428
Come on.

447
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:30,724
– Is it safe to let him around that guy?
– Frank’s crazy about him.

448
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:34,770
He likes the way he talks and he helped
Frank carry home the laundry.

449
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:38,238
He’s been in the hospital a long time.
There must be something wrong with him.

450
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:41,436
He’s retarded. Frank’s always after
a father figure.

451
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:43,809
Lord knows Doyle ain’t a good one
with his mean ass.

452
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,611
– What about me?
– He doesn’t see you as a “guy” guy.

453
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:49,709
Karl’s a “guy” guy?

454
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,974
I call this my secret place.

455
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:14,341
I come out here when I feel like
being alone.

456
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:16,470
I used to come here with Karen Cross.

457
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:20,379
She kind of used to be my girlfriend.

458
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:23,452
We would come out here
and hold hands and talk…

459
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,887
and read books to each other
with a flashlight.

460
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:29,756
She wouldn’t have nothing to do with me
in front of other people…

461
00:40:29,826 --> 00:40:33,853
because Mama and I
don’t have any money.

462
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,899
Her daddy’s a dentist,
so they’re rich.

463
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:40,228
Was your folks well off?

464
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:44,933
No, we barely had enough
to scrape by on, I reckon.

465
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:47,841
Your folks still around?

466
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,845
My mother’s dead.

467
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:54,440
My daddy’s still around but he don’t
want to have nothing to do with me.

468
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:58,248
– How do you know?
– He never did want to.

469
00:40:58,354 --> 00:41:02,222
I figure he probably
ain’t changed his mind much.

470
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,226
How’d your mama die?

471
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,094
You don’t need to hear
things like that.

472
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:11,224
You just a boy.

473
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:14,464
You need to think good thoughts
while you still a boy.

474
00:41:14,537 --> 00:41:17,768
There’s lots of time for all the other.

475
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:20,537
I had bad thoughts since Daddy died.

476
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,876
Sometimes I wish I was still little
and he was still here.

477
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:27,814
Mama’s real good, but I wish
I had both of them.

478
00:41:27,884 --> 00:41:30,375
We went to Memphis in the car once.

479
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:33,047
It was raining so hard
we couldn’t see the road…

480
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:35,954
but I wasn’t scared because
as long as Daddy was driving…

481
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:38,016
nothing could happen to us.

482
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:40,187
That’s the way I feel about Mama now.

483
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:44,992
Mama has a boyfriend now.

484
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:48,037
His name is Doyle Hargraves.

485
00:41:48,104 --> 00:41:50,800
He works construction so he makes
a pretty good living…

486
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:53,707
but he don’t help Mama out
with any money.

487
00:41:53,776 --> 00:41:58,110
He ain’t no good. He’s mean to her.
He don’t like me at all.

488
00:41:58,214 --> 00:42:02,708
Mama says he’s jealous
because I belong to my daddy.

489
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:07,756
He spends the night at our house
and he’s got his own house.

490
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:11,123
Somebody told me this way
he can have more girlfriends.

491
00:42:11,194 --> 00:42:14,789
I like the nights he’s not there.
I ain’t so nervous then.

492
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:21,997
How come she’s still being girlfriends
with him if he’s mean to her?

493
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:24,904
She says it’s for the times
he’s good to her.

494
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:26,908
She’s lonely since Daddy died.

495
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:29,501
Sometimes she don’t know why.

496
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:32,103
He threatened to kill her
if she left him.

497
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:36,811
My daddy would kill him if he was here
and somebody was mean to Mama.

498
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,945
Vaughan’s real good to Mama.

499
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:41,023
Vaughan that you met?

500
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,389
But he’s not able to do anything
to Doyle. He’s funny.

501
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,553
Not “funny,” ha-ha.
“Funny,” queer.

502
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:48,824
He likes to go with men.

503
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:53,665
That makes him not able to fight good,
but he sure is nice.

504
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:58,070
He’s from St. Louis. Queer people
get along better in a big town.

505
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:00,575
I wish he like to go with women.

506
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:03,703
I’d rather him be Mama’s boyfriend
than Doyle.

507
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:09,542
Karl, remember I told you Daddy
got hit by a train?

508
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:11,677
Yes, sir, I recollect that.

509
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:16,785
It ain’t the truth. He shot himself
with a shotgun on purpose.

510
00:43:18,328 --> 00:43:20,262
How come him do that?

511
00:43:21,931 --> 00:43:25,697
Because he didn’t have enough money
to take care of us like he wanted to.

512
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:27,668
That’s what the letter said.

513
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:31,400
He got laid off of work
and did odd jobs.

514
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:33,772
I thought he took care of us
just fine.

515
00:43:39,582 --> 00:43:43,313
Karl, did you really kill somebody?

516
00:43:43,386 --> 00:43:44,910
Yes, sir, I did.

517
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:47,990
– Who’d you kill?
– Two people.

518
00:43:48,057 --> 00:43:51,185
– Were they bad people?
– I thought they was.

519
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:54,763
Maybe they needed it.

520
00:43:55,932 --> 00:44:01,427
I growed up and learned that you ain’t
supposed to kill nobody.

521
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:05,463
It’s okay if you’re protecting yourself,
if it’s self-defence.

522
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,839
Was it self-defence.?

523
00:44:11,147 --> 00:44:13,115
My daddy was good.

524
00:44:13,149 --> 00:44:15,640
I think too many good people die.

525
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:17,686
That’s what I think.

526
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:42,977
You sure you wanna
stay with these folks?

527
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:46,914
You’re welcome to stay here.
It’s working out good.

528
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:49,883
That boy wants me to.

529
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:52,887
All right, then.
I’ll see you bright and early.

530
00:44:52,955 --> 00:44:54,923
How’s that garden tiller coming?

531
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:57,754
I fixed it.
It’s working pretty good now.

532
00:44:57,827 --> 00:45:00,352
You done fixed it?
I’ll be damned.

533
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,489
Scooter told me it couldn’t be fixed.

534
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:06,194
Of course, Scooter’s about as shiftless
as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be.

535
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:10,000
You done fixed it.
Well, I’ll just be damned.

536
00:45:10,073 --> 00:45:12,906
– I’ll see you tomorrow.
– All right, then.

537
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:25,053
I don’t guess I’ll give a shit, then.
I ain’t here that much.

538
00:45:25,154 --> 00:45:28,885
If you want a retard living
in your garage, that’s your business.

539
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:32,257
I do got some tools
I’d rather not have stoled.

540
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:34,319
I could take those home with me.

541
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:36,592
He’s real honest.
He wouldn’t steal nothing.

542
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:40,568
Frankie, I wasn’t talking to you,
was I?

543
00:45:40,636 --> 00:45:42,763
– No, sir.
– “No, sir” is right.

544
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:46,297
I was talking to your mama.
It’s her decision, not yours.

545
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:49,139
If I let it go on,
it’s because she asked me, not you.

546
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:56,742
Does this retard drool
and rub shit in his hair and all that?

547
00:45:56,853 --> 00:46:00,016
I’m going to have a hard time eating
around that kind of thing.

548
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:02,557
Just like with antique furniture
and midgets.

549
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:07,119
I can’t so much as drink a glass of
water around a midget or an antique.

550
00:46:07,196 --> 00:46:09,596
Doyle, you’re awful.
You shouldn’t be that way.

551
00:46:09,665 --> 00:46:15,228
I ain’t saying it’s right. It’s just
the truth. He’ll make me sick.

552
00:46:15,304 --> 00:46:19,536
– What was he in the nut house for?
– He’s just retarded, I guess.

553
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:23,773
No, he had of gone nuts
and did something.

554
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:27,111
A lot of retards running around that
ain’t locked up in the nut house.

555
00:46:27,183 --> 00:46:29,583
Think about it, Linda.

556
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:31,676
You know what he done, Frank?

557
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,951
– I ain’t sure.
– You oughta want to find out.

558
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:37,993
He might have hacked his family
to pieces with a hatchet or something.

559
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,994
Frank, you’d better ask him.

560
00:46:40,062 --> 00:46:43,327
Don’t hurt his feelings,
but it would be good to know.

561
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:45,560
I’m sure it’s nothing.
He seems sweet.

562
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:49,834
You’re all hung up
on people being sweet.

563
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:53,808
He’s sweet. Everybody’s sweet. Speaking
of sweet, where’s your girlfriend?

564
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:56,868
– I thought he was coming over.
– He’ll be here in a while.

565
00:46:56,946 --> 00:47:00,712
– We’re going for ice cream.
– Now ain’t that sweet.

566
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:03,752
What do I do about supper while you’re
running around with that fag?

567
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,618
You’re not crippled.
Go make something.

568
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:09,157
Talking back and everything,
aren’t you?

569
00:47:09,225 --> 00:47:11,352
That makes me horny.

570
00:47:11,427 --> 00:47:15,295
Frank, go and play in your room,
if Doyle’s going to talk nasty.

571
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:19,494
– I don’t want to go play.
– He don’t want to. Let him stay.

572
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:25,474
Let’s be a family till your mentally
retarded and homosexual friends arrive.

573
00:47:39,488 --> 00:47:41,422
Yes, sir?

574
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:45,319
You’re really going to stay here.

575
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:48,625
That boy wants me to.

576
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:50,632
Have you knocked yet?

577
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:54,932
– No, sir, I ain’t.
– How long have you been here?

578
00:47:57,406 --> 00:48:00,068
Quite a spell, I reckon.

579
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:04,909
Before you get used to staying here,
we need to talk about a few things.

580
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:07,279
Can I take you to lunch?

581
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,614
I done ate a little bit ago.

582
00:48:09,685 --> 00:48:12,245
I mean tomorrow
or the next day.

583
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:17,583
I reckon I could eat something
at noontime.

584
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:22,128
Bill Cox generally gets me
a box lunch…

585
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:25,964
but I reckon he can
lay off doing it tomorrow.

586
00:48:26,035 --> 00:48:30,870
Then I’ll come by and
pick you up around noon, all right?

587
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,874
All right, then.

588
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:38,780
There’s your girlfriend.

589
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:45,254
Y’all come on in.

590
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:49,023
Come on. Have a seat in here.

591
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:54,696
– Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
– Tolerable, I reckon.

592
00:48:54,764 --> 00:49:00,396
Karl, this is Doyle. Frank, you and Karl
go fix him up a place in the garage.

593
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:02,528
– Vaughan, you ready to go?
– Sure.

594
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,539
Honey, don’t rush everybody off.

595
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:08,134
– You and Karl want to go with us?
– I don’t want to.

596
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:10,508
We got things we need to do.

597
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:12,877
Vaughan, you know what I heard?

598
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,282
That you been putting it on Albert
Sellers over at the funeral home.

599
00:49:16,352 --> 00:49:20,516
– I know Albert. We’re friends.
– I heard you was more than friends.

600
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:25,185
I heard Dick Rivers caught you two
going at it in the same room…

601
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:28,890
with poor old Mrs. Ogletree and her dead
as a doornail laid out on a gurney.

602
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:32,230
– That’s ridiculous, a total lie.
– Let’s go, Vaughan.

603
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:34,633
We’ll be back in a while.
I’ll bring you something.

604
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:39,697
– Your food’s in the oven warming over.
– You fixed him something.

605
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:44,610
Vaughan, I was just going on with you.
Just joking around. You know, buddy.

606
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,148
I know. You’re a real card.

607
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,788
Karl, come over,
sit down and talk to me.

608
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:06,128
Come on, Karl.
Let’s go to the garage.

609
00:50:06,202 --> 00:50:08,762
Goddammit. I want to talk to him.

610
00:50:08,871 --> 00:50:10,771
Sit down, Karl.

611
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:18,674
What’s in your bag?

612
00:50:22,685 --> 00:50:25,882
This and that.
Toothpaste and whatnot.

613
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,756
– What’s all them books?
– Different ones.

614
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:35,223
One of them’s the Bible.

615
00:50:35,297 --> 00:50:37,458
You believe in the Bible,
Karl?

616
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:41,227
Yes, sir. A good deal of it.

617
00:50:41,337 --> 00:50:43,737
I can’t understand all of it.

618
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:47,832
I can’t understand none of it.

619
00:50:47,943 --> 00:50:50,639
This one begat that one,
that one begat this one…

620
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:55,615
and begat and begat and lo and behold
someone says some shit to someone.

621
00:50:55,684 --> 00:50:58,152
– How retarded are you?
– Stop it, Doyle.

622
00:50:58,254 --> 00:51:02,850
Frankie, be quiet. We’re talking.
The adults are talking.

623
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:08,724
Was you in lockup for cutting someone
with a hatchet or something?

624
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,034
I ain’t never used no hatchet
that I remember.

625
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:18,198
So you’re just crazy
in a retard kind of way then?

626
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:23,069
It wouldn’t matter to me
if you did do violence.

627
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:25,875
I ain’t scared of shit.

628
00:51:25,948 --> 00:51:28,974
You think I’m scared
for you to stay here?

629
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:31,747
You just a humped-over retard.

630
00:51:37,593 --> 00:51:42,360
I’m just kidding you.
Welcome to our humble home, buddy.

631
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:45,161
Frank needs
all the friends he can get.

632
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:48,429
Frank’s a weak little kid.

633
00:51:48,537 --> 00:51:50,767
His daddy taught him
how to be a pussy.

634
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,967
Don’t talk about my daddy.

635
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:59,742
Go on out to the garage.
Leave me be.

636
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:02,383
Go on.

637
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:04,385
Come on, Karl.

638
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:20,499
Don’t say nothing
about our little spat to your mama.

639
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:22,503
I don’t want her worrying.

640
00:52:26,775 --> 00:52:30,142
I’d like to kill that son-of-a-bitch.
I hate him.

641
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,181
You ought not talk that away.
You just a boy.

642
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:37,310
Well, I hate him.

643
00:52:37,386 --> 00:52:40,150
He ought not talk that away
to you neither.

644
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:43,521
He ain’t no account. He’s mean
to you and your mama.

645
00:52:46,195 --> 00:52:48,925
Your mama and that fellow that’s
carrying me to get something to eat’s…

646
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:51,728
going to be back directly.

647
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,928
Will you be here with us
for a long time?

648
00:52:55,037 --> 00:52:57,130
I reckon,
if you want me to.

649
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:04,244
I got some of that potted meat
and soda crackers if you want some.

650
00:53:04,313 --> 00:53:09,216
How can you eat all that stuff
with them insides it’s made out of?

651
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:11,617
I reckon it tastes
pretty good to me.

652
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:16,322
I like the way you talk.

653
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:18,952
Well, I like the way you talk.

654
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:25,027
You think it’s really got
peckers in there?

655
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,830
You know better than to say that word.

656
00:53:30,506 --> 00:53:32,599
It smells kinda funny.

657
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:35,609
It’s a little loud.
Looky right here.

658
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:38,646
I believe you right.
I believe I see one in there.

659
00:53:45,821 --> 00:53:47,618
Thank you, sir.

660
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:06,072
Mister, could you hand me
that mustard over there?

661
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:10,278
Thank you.

662
00:54:15,017 --> 00:54:17,577
Okay, Karl.
The reason that I…

663
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:19,917
brought you here is…

664
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:22,787
to talk about something
that’s on my mind.

665
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:26,089
I’m just going to put it
right out on the table.

666
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:29,263
Where do I start?

667
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:35,230
Linda and Frank are
very important to me.

668
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:37,465
They’re like family.

669
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:40,804
My own family was never like a family.

670
00:54:40,909 --> 00:54:45,107
They’re horrible people.
As a matter of fact…

671
00:54:45,214 --> 00:54:49,913
for years I prayed every night
that my father would die…

672
00:54:49,985 --> 00:54:52,749
and finally realized,
through a lot of therapy…

673
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:57,383
I was wasting my energy
on hating him.

674
00:54:57,459 --> 00:55:01,190
So now I just don’t care.

675
00:55:01,263 --> 00:55:04,892
But you see, you and I
are a lot alike…

676
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:06,901
as strange as that may seem.

677
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:12,202
I don’t mean physically
or even mentally, really…

678
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,435
but emotionally.

679
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:19,139
Actually, the hand
we’ve been dealt in life –

680
00:55:20,582 --> 00:55:25,281
We’re different. People see us
as being different, anyway.

681
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:28,551
You’re –
You’ve got…

682
00:55:28,624 --> 00:55:31,923
your affliction or whatever and I –

683
00:55:31,994 --> 00:55:34,428
Well, mine’s not as easy to see.

684
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:38,158
I’m just going to say it.

685
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:40,167
I’m gay.

686
00:55:41,236 --> 00:55:44,330
Does that surprise you?

687
00:55:44,406 --> 00:55:46,374
That I’m gay?

688
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:52,878
– You know what “gay” is, don’t you?
– I don’t reckon.

689
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:58,486
Homosexual.

690
00:55:58,554 --> 00:56:01,717
I like men. Sexually.

691
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:06,384
Not “funny,” ha-ha.
“Funny,” queer.

692
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:11,991
That’s an offensive way
to put it.

693
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:14,092
You shouldn’t say that.

694
00:56:14,169 --> 00:56:17,138
You were taught that,
weren’t you?

695
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:19,936
I’ve heard it said that away,
yes, sir.

696
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:24,911
Anyway, it’s hard to live gay –
that’s the right way to say it –

697
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,880
in a small town like this.

698
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:30,646
I’ve wanted to leave many times, but…

699
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,846
because I love…

700
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:36,721
Linda, Frank and…

701
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:39,590
a certain other person –

702
00:56:39,661 --> 00:56:42,323
They’ve kept me here.
Anyway, I’m rambling.

703
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:46,926
If you’re going to live
in the Wheatley garage…

704
00:56:47,002 --> 00:56:49,527
you need to know it’s
not going to be easy.

705
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:52,267
Doyle is a monster.

706
00:56:52,374 --> 00:56:57,778
Not just a closed-minded redneck,
but a monster, a dangerous person.

707
00:56:57,846 --> 00:57:03,716
I’ve told Linda that one day that man
is going to hurt her and that boy…

708
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:06,084
maybe even kill them.

709
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:09,750
I see it in his eyes.
I’m very in tune, even psychic.

710
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:12,385
But Doyle is going to
make your life hell.

711
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:21,261
There’s one more thing.

712
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:25,796
It’s none of my business why you were
in the state hospital.

713
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:29,173
Everybody has something
in their past.

714
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:31,269
Maybe…

715
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,974
you tried suicide.

716
00:57:34,049 --> 00:57:37,780
Maybe you did something terrible.

717
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:40,981
But what I see before me…

718
00:57:41,056 --> 00:57:43,820
is a gentle…

719
00:57:43,892 --> 00:57:46,952
simple man.

720
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:51,056
All I want you to promise me…

721
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,830
is that you are capable of being
around Frank and Linda.

722
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:57,428
You know. You would never…

723
00:57:57,506 --> 00:58:01,408
hurt either of them
for any reason, would you?

724
00:58:03,045 --> 00:58:05,036
I would never hurt them.

725
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:11,678
That’s what I thought. I’m sorry
if I’ve offended you in any way.

726
00:58:12,754 --> 00:58:16,019
You seem like a thinker, you know.

727
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:20,152
You seem to always be deep in thought.

728
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:22,720
What are you thinking right now?

729
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:33,070
I was thinking I might wanna take some
of these potatoes home with me.

730
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:37,204
How about before that?

731
00:58:44,586 --> 00:58:46,713
Let me think.

732
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,883
Before that, I was thinking…

733
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:54,053
I could use me six or eight cans
of that potted meat…

734
00:58:54,129 --> 00:58:56,427
if you got any extra.

735
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:08,404
Frankie, get some of this salad.

736
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:12,206
Hold your plate up for me.

737
00:59:13,782 --> 00:59:17,946
I’m just gonna reach.
How come Karl won’t eat in here with us?

738
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,421
I don’t know.
He said he’d eat out there.

739
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,186
I wouldn’t let it get to you.
Put some dressing on there.

740
00:59:24,259 --> 00:59:27,626
– Yes.
– I just feel sorry for the poor thing.

741
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:33,862
Who the hell could eat with him making
all that racket in his throat?

742
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:36,234
He does make some funny noises.

743
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:38,238
I like the way he talks.

744
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,140
Sounds like a race car motor idling.
Makes me not be nervous.

745
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:44,269
I’m glad of it.

746
00:59:44,379 --> 00:59:47,644
What have you got to be nervous about?
You’re a kid.

747
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:50,947
You got no bills to pay,
no business to run.

748
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:55,752
You don’t even have to have a job.
You got no old lady on your ass at all.

749
00:59:55,824 --> 00:59:58,987
I don’t know.
I just stay nervous.

750
01:00:00,963 --> 01:00:02,897
Could I have some of that ham?

751
01:00:02,965 --> 01:00:04,899
Yeah. I’m sorry.

752
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,870
Thank you.

753
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:32,616
– You know what, by God?
– What?

754
01:00:32,694 --> 01:00:34,628
I know what I ought to do tonight.

755
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:37,565
Please, don’t.

756
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:41,465
I’m gonna call up Morris
and get the band together.

757
01:00:41,536 --> 01:00:43,936
We’re gonna party our asses off.

758
01:00:45,641 --> 01:00:48,303
I’d love to show them Karl.
They’d get a kick out of him.

759
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,810
Not tonight.
I’m not up for it.

760
01:00:50,879 --> 01:00:54,110
They always stay till morning.
I’ll just give out.

761
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:56,650
You don’t gotta do nothing.
Just put chips in a bowl…

762
01:00:56,752 --> 01:00:59,550
and run ice out to us
when we get low.

763
01:00:59,621 --> 01:01:03,887
Last time, you got mad and run Morris
and them off and told them to stay away.

764
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:08,328
That ain’t none of your business.
Besides, that’s the way friends are.

765
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,926
Fuck. I’m calling them up.

766
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,700
Linda, go into the garage
and get my guitar.

767
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:23,176
It’s out there with that loony toon.

768
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:25,213
Now?

769
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:27,679
Yeah, now.
I’m calling them up.

770
01:01:27,749 --> 01:01:31,947
Morris, what you doing, boy?

771
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,580
Where’s Randy and them?

772
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:38,615
Yeah, now. Please.
Frankie, go help your mum.

773
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:40,628
– When are we gonna eat?
– Hang on.

774
01:01:40,696 --> 01:01:42,630
Eat when you come back.
Get my guitar.

775
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:44,791
Come on, sugar.

776
01:01:44,866 --> 01:01:46,834
I wanna get together.

777
01:01:46,902 --> 01:01:48,733
Yeah.

778
01:01:49,738 --> 01:01:51,205
Call him.

779
01:01:51,306 --> 01:01:54,366
One. Two. One, two, three, four.

780
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:40,212
You gotta play through it. Wail on the
gig, but you gotta play through it.

781
01:02:40,288 --> 01:02:42,222
– No, you play through –
– You like that, Vaughan?

782
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:45,885
Sure. It sounds like
a number one hit tune.

783
01:02:46,995 --> 01:02:49,225
Karl, did you like that?

784
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:53,968
– I reckon.
– I wish you’d all lay off for tonight!

785
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:57,300
– I can’t think with that racket!
– Hey!

786
01:02:57,372 --> 01:03:00,603
– It’s nighttime.
– Hey!

787
01:03:00,675 --> 01:03:03,644
– I’m calling the police!
– I told you already!

788
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:05,680
The law’s on my side!

789
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:10,851
I play cards with J.D. Shelnut,
chief of police!

790
01:03:10,919 --> 01:03:14,116
So kiss my ass, you old bastard!

791
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:20,123
You and Frank clean this mess up.
Put the tarp over these instruments.

792
01:03:20,228 --> 01:03:23,561
Me and the boys are going to
the county line. We’re out of liquor.

793
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:26,657
Karl, come with us.
Vaughan, come on.

794
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:30,101
It’s late.
I have to work tomorrow.

795
01:03:30,172 --> 01:03:32,936
Don’t be a pussy.
We all gotta work tomorrow.

796
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:34,805
– Come on.
– He don’t want to.

797
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:38,778
Don’t go if you don’t want to.
You’ll wreck, Doyle. You’re drunk.

798
01:03:38,847 --> 01:03:43,477
I ain’t gonna wreck.
I’ll be good. I promise.

799
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:45,520
I love you, sweetie.

800
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:48,647
Come on, Karl. Go with us.

801
01:03:48,723 --> 01:03:52,352
Just trying to make these two
feel like they’re part of it.

802
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:54,122
Come on, Vaughan.
This’ll be fun.

803
01:03:54,229 --> 01:03:56,959
Karl, let’s go.
Come on.

804
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:08,737
– You gotta lay out on that tambourine.
– I ain’t did nothing wrong.

805
01:04:17,586 --> 01:04:21,545
Hey! Ain’t anybody gonna come get me?

806
01:04:22,724 --> 01:04:25,659
I don’t understand
what you are talking about.

807
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,129
– Exactly the point, my young friend.
– I don’t get it.

808
01:04:30,232 --> 01:04:32,826
I rest my case.

809
01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:35,994
Morris is real smart
with philosophies and things.

810
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:39,302
That’s why him and me is the
songwriting team of our group.

811
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:43,834
I come up with the good tunes,
or melodies, as we call them…

812
01:04:43,912 --> 01:04:45,846
Morris is the lyrics.

813
01:04:45,914 --> 01:04:48,678
Not unlike Gary Brooker
of Procol Harum.

814
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:52,277
We don’t ever played songs
y’all wrote. I ain’t heard one of them.

815
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:53,685
Y’all just talk.

816
01:04:53,755 --> 01:04:57,282
We don’t play any songs
with words at all.

817
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:02,058
We ain’t got no fucking microphone!
We ain’t got no speakers!

818
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:04,428
We wrote one last night
outside the mini-mart.

819
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:08,799
Morris called it, “Stuart Drives
a Comfortable Car.”

820
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:14,308
Then, like in country songs,
in parenthesis it says…

821
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:17,504
“There’s usually someone in the trunk.”

822
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:20,707
And I came up with a tune,
just humming.

823
01:05:20,782 --> 01:05:24,047
You don’t wanna question
a genius, Vaughan.

824
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:26,781
Morris here’s a modern-day poet.

825
01:05:26,855 --> 01:05:28,982
Kind of like in the olden times.

826
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:34,586
Yeah, I got a new tune. This
composition’s entitled, “The Thrill.”

827
01:05:34,696 --> 01:05:36,493
Goes something like this:

828
01:05:36,564 --> 01:05:41,331
I stand on the hill,
not for a thrill…

829
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:44,497
but for a breath of a fresh kill.

830
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:47,871
Never mind the man who contemplates…

831
01:05:47,943 --> 01:05:50,810
doing away with license plates.

832
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:53,712
He stands alone anyhow…

833
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:56,945
baking the cookies of discontent…

834
01:05:57,018 --> 01:06:00,112
by the heat of the laundromat vent.

835
01:06:00,188 --> 01:06:02,918
Leaving his soul.

836
01:06:02,991 --> 01:06:06,791
Then, like in poetry,
I go dot, dot, dot.

837
01:06:06,895 --> 01:06:10,058
You know, kind of off-centre,
then I drop down…

838
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:12,827
and then I go: Leaving his soul…

839
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:17,303
parting the waters
of the medulla oblongata…

840
01:06:17,372 --> 01:06:18,839
of…

841
01:06:20,642 --> 01:06:22,769
mankind.

842
01:06:22,844 --> 01:06:25,278
Damn good song, wasn’t it?
You like that song?

843
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:28,111
All right.

844
01:06:28,183 --> 01:06:30,151
I don’t think that’s right.

845
01:06:30,218 --> 01:06:32,982
I believe the “dot, dot, dot”
come between…

846
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:35,113
“medulla” and “oblongata.”

847
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:40,989
Well, it did.

848
01:06:41,096 --> 01:06:43,291
The dots are where I say they are.

849
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:46,765
Melody and tune.
That’s your trade, Terence.

850
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:49,099
You’re a tunesmith.

851
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,297
I don’t understand the words.

852
01:06:51,373 --> 01:06:54,536
Y’all don’t shut up,
I’m gonna go out of my mind.

853
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:59,308
Besides, Karl’s liable to bust his
spring. He’s already off balance.

854
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:02,509
That wasn’t the way you made
it up before. That’s all I know.

855
01:07:02,584 --> 01:07:07,385
We don’t need no fancy words.
We need to practice, to rehearse.

856
01:07:07,455 --> 01:07:10,788
I’ll tell you what we need.
We need some paying gigs.

857
01:07:10,859 --> 01:07:15,455
We don’t need this messing around.
That’s ridiculous.

858
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,191
Amen, Johnson.

859
01:07:18,733 --> 01:07:22,396
We don’t got no goddamn band!

860
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:25,598
We don’t need to fucking practice!

861
01:07:25,673 --> 01:07:29,871
We don’t need a shit-ass manager
neither!

862
01:07:29,944 --> 01:07:33,971
You motherfuckers!
You’re all just a bunch of losers!

863
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:36,574
I’m the only sane son-of-a-bitch here!

864
01:07:36,651 --> 01:07:38,642
Get the fuck out of my house!

865
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,018
It’s not your house.
It’s Linda’s.

866
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:43,785
I’ll whip the dog shit out of you.

867
01:07:43,892 --> 01:07:47,020
I will fucking kill you
if you talk to me again!

868
01:07:47,095 --> 01:07:51,555
All of you get the fuck out
before I get too mad to turn back!

869
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:54,864
What about our instruments?

870
01:07:55,937 --> 01:07:57,495
Come here, you little prick!

871
01:07:57,605 --> 01:08:01,063
Come here, you little fucking prick!

872
01:08:01,843 --> 01:08:04,869
Get out!
All y’all!

873
01:08:04,946 --> 01:08:06,937
Get the fuck out!

874
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:08,949
Come on, you motherfuckers!

875
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:13,887
Get the fuck out!

876
01:08:13,955 --> 01:08:16,321
Randy, you tuning son-of-a-bitch!

877
01:08:18,026 --> 01:08:19,960
Go fucking practice!

878
01:08:23,131 --> 01:08:26,100
Come on, Morris. You fucking genius.
Get the fuck up…

879
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:31,172
and get the fuck out of here,
goddammit!

880
01:08:31,172 --> 01:08:33,197
This ain’t right, Doyle.

881
01:08:34,776 --> 01:08:37,006
– There’s something wrong with you.
– Get out!

882
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:39,412
Nobody wants to take this shit.

883
01:08:50,067 --> 01:08:53,059
Dots look good on paper.
You don’t sing them anyway.

884
01:08:53,137 --> 01:08:58,269
– You’re just showing your true colours.
– Stay out of my face, you buzzard!

885
01:09:04,954 --> 01:09:09,288
Hey! I said get out of my house!

886
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,157
That goes for cocksuckers and retards!

887
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:13,992
Get up off your asses and go!

888
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:16,830
This is not your house.
This is my house.

889
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,927
I’ll say who stays and goes.

890
01:09:19,006 --> 01:09:23,102
You got a house.
Why don’t you go home to it?

891
01:09:23,213 --> 01:09:26,307
You know better to talk like
that when I’m hurting.

892
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:28,316
Don’t make me knock the piss out of you.

893
01:09:28,419 --> 01:09:30,910
Don’t you touch her.

894
01:09:31,023 --> 01:09:33,457
That’s funny, Vaughan.

895
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:37,224
Linda, go to bed.
And take little snot-nose here with you.

896
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,492
You’re not staying here tonight.

897
01:09:39,568 --> 01:09:43,561
Get sober before you come back.
I’m tired of my child seeing this.

898
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:48,739
Get your ass straight or I’ll lock
your ass out of my life for good.

899
01:09:48,814 --> 01:09:52,875
If you even think about leaving me,
I told you…

900
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:55,182
I’m gonna kill you deader than
a doornail.

901
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:58,249
– That might be better than this.
– I’m a witness to you threatening her.

902
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:00,421
You get the fuck out now!

903
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:02,122
Leave!

904
01:10:03,234 --> 01:10:06,670
– Don’t tell me what to do.
– Leave!

905
01:10:13,115 --> 01:10:15,777
– Don’t do that!
– I’m calling the police!

906
01:10:15,852 --> 01:10:19,720
– Goddamn you, little prick!
– Don’t touch my mama!

907
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:22,817
Don’t touch her!
Go home!

908
01:10:22,895 --> 01:10:25,557
– Get away from here!
– Jesus!

909
01:10:25,632 --> 01:10:28,100
Hey! Goddamn you!

910
01:10:28,169 --> 01:10:30,102
Get away from us!

911
01:10:34,712 --> 01:10:36,645
Get away from us!

912
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:41,044
All right.
Okay.

913
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,554
I’m gonna leave now.
Fuck me.

914
01:10:48,197 --> 01:10:50,597
I’m gonna go home and sober up.

915
01:10:52,704 --> 01:10:55,468
Go on, then.

916
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:58,635
Everything’s bothering me.
I’m hurting, Linda.

917
01:11:00,847 --> 01:11:02,837
– I love you.
– Well, I hate you!

918
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:06,978
I hate you, you little prick!
No, I don’t.

919
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:10,059
I love your mama.

920
01:11:10,127 --> 01:11:12,060
I just –

921
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:14,894
I can’t explain what goes on.

922
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:17,993
You bunch of freaks.
I hope you have fun.

923
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:22,174
I’ll call you tomorrow.

924
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:24,844
I’m sorry, honey.

925
01:11:27,618 --> 01:11:29,482
I said I’m sorry, Linda.

926
01:11:33,826 --> 01:11:36,727
All right.
You can kiss my ass.

927
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:39,288
And if you ever hit me again,
you little bastard…

928
01:11:39,367 --> 01:11:43,326
I’ll make you sorry
your daddy ever squirted your ass out.

929
01:11:43,407 --> 01:11:45,431
You hear me?

930
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:07,964
– You all right?
– I’m fine.

931
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:10,908
Let’s just try
and forget about tonight.

932
01:12:12,547 --> 01:12:15,345
We don’t need to think about
bad thoughts, do we?

933
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:17,441
No, honey. We don’t.

934
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:21,089
I’ll make some coffee
and start cleaning up.

935
01:12:21,159 --> 01:12:24,128
Karl, you want some coffee, hon?

936
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:27,529
Coffee kindly make me nervous
when I drink it.

937
01:12:44,391 --> 01:12:47,383
You scared me.

938
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:51,956
– I didn’t aim to.
– You wanna sit down? You need something?

939
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:54,002
No, ma’am.

940
01:13:09,926 --> 01:13:14,864
There was these two fellers standing
on a bridge going to the bathroom.

941
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:21,234
One feller says that the water is cold.

942
01:13:21,343 --> 01:13:23,743
The other says that the water is deep.

943
01:13:27,651 --> 01:13:30,176
I believe one feller comes from
Arkansas.

944
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:33,223
Get it?

945
01:13:34,929 --> 01:13:36,919
I’ll be dog.

946
01:13:49,348 --> 01:13:52,875
Reckon you can make some biscuits?

947
01:13:52,954 --> 01:13:55,650
You mean right now?

948
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:59,319
Whenever you take a notion to.
I don’t mean to put you out none.

949
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:03,326
It is nearly breakfast time anyway.

950
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,029
I can’t go to sleep.
I have to be at work in three hours.

951
01:14:07,106 --> 01:14:09,506
You know how it is if you only sleep
an hour or two.

952
01:14:09,576 --> 01:14:12,602
You feel worse than if you hadn’t
slept at all.

953
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,613
Yes, ma’am. I do.

954
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:20,548
Sit down.
I’ll make you some biscuits and gravy.

955
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:24,186
– Mustard’s good on them to me.
– Okay.

956
01:14:24,263 --> 01:14:28,097
– Thank you.
– It’s all right.

957
01:14:30,171 --> 01:14:34,369
I was thinking –
There’s this girl that works with me.

958
01:14:34,443 --> 01:14:37,344
She’s real heavy,
but she’s cute in the face.

959
01:14:37,414 --> 01:14:40,906
Well, you know, she’s slow.

960
01:14:42,488 --> 01:14:47,153
She’s a little bit –
She’s not retarded.

961
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:50,494
It don’t matter.
I thought you might like to meet her.

962
01:14:50,566 --> 01:14:53,831
Vaughan wants to have a supper at his
house. We could invite her.

963
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:56,029
Would you like that?

964
01:14:57,142 --> 01:15:00,703
I reckon I wouldn’t mind
having a little supper.

965
01:15:00,814 --> 01:15:04,250
Vaughan’s friend will be there too.
He works at the funeral home.

966
01:15:06,588 --> 01:15:08,954
You know, Frank really likes you a lot.

967
01:15:09,025 --> 01:15:11,755
He says you make him feel calm.

968
01:15:11,828 --> 01:15:15,264
I like Frank.
He’s a good boy.

969
01:15:15,334 --> 01:15:17,962
Me and him made friends.

970
01:15:25,247 --> 01:15:27,180
It ain’t right for me to keep
from telling you…

971
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:29,775
how come me to be in a state hospital.

972
01:15:31,356 --> 01:15:34,154
That’s okay.
It’s not really my business.

973
01:15:35,795 --> 01:15:38,355
Have wondered, though.

974
01:15:38,466 --> 01:15:42,266
Why was it?
Was it like a nervous breakdown?

975
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:53,074
I killed my mother
and an old boy named Jesse Dixon.

976
01:15:53,153 --> 01:15:55,621
I thought they’s doing wrong.

977
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:59,253
I was about your boy’s age.

978
01:15:59,328 --> 01:16:01,386
They told me I’m well from it now.

979
01:16:01,464 --> 01:16:03,397
Was that you?

980
01:16:03,467 --> 01:16:05,992
I remember that.
I was only three or four…

981
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:08,470
but I always heard about it
growing up.

982
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,135
They say you’re well?

983
01:16:11,245 --> 01:16:13,178
Yes, ma’am.

984
01:16:19,891 --> 01:16:22,051
I like your garage.

985
01:16:26,131 --> 01:16:29,464
I never would hurt you or that boy.

986
01:16:29,537 --> 01:16:33,633
I’d lay my hand on the Bible
and say the same thing.

987
01:16:33,709 --> 01:16:36,041
I know you wouldn’t, hon.

988
01:16:43,355 --> 01:16:45,880
Well, I’ll make you some biscuits.

989
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:02,173
How about you, Jerry?

990
01:17:02,248 --> 01:17:04,648
– How are you, Bill?
– Doing pretty good.

991
01:17:04,718 --> 01:17:08,176
Got a sick tiller.
What’s got you down this way?

992
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,952
I thought I’d check up on Karl.
See how things are working out.

993
01:17:11,027 --> 01:17:14,554
He’s pretty quiet, except for them
rackets and breathing things he does.

994
01:17:14,633 --> 01:17:16,965
He ain’t threatening me
with a killing or nothing.

995
01:17:17,035 --> 01:17:19,333
You couldn’t have been more right
about him fixing things.

996
01:17:19,405 --> 01:17:22,067
He’s a regular Eli Whitney
on a lawn mower.

997
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:26,773
And loves French fries. He can eat
four larges and won’t even belch.

998
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:28,713
I’m proud to have him.

999
01:17:28,785 --> 01:17:31,652
– Him staying working out?
– He’s gone to staying with…

1000
01:17:31,756 --> 01:17:34,156
that Wheatley boy and his mama
in their garage.

1001
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:37,161
That little boy’s adopted
him like a mascot.

1002
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:39,494
He got a key here
to come and go as he pleases.

1003
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:41,431
He’s working out real good.

1004
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,060
– Can I see him?
– Sure.

1005
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:45,537
Scooter, take Jerry in
to talk to Karl.

1006
01:17:45,608 --> 01:17:47,541
All right.

1007
01:17:52,819 --> 01:17:55,947
Sure you’ll be okay
staying with that woman and her boy?

1008
01:17:56,023 --> 01:17:57,956
Yes, sir.

1009
01:17:58,026 --> 01:18:00,824
Do they know about you?

1010
01:18:00,896 --> 01:18:02,829
My history?

1011
01:18:02,899 --> 01:18:04,729
Yeah.

1012
01:18:04,802 --> 01:18:07,362
I told them about it.

1013
01:18:09,576 --> 01:18:11,908
They know I’m well.

1014
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,346
That Miss Wheatley
made me some biscuits.

1015
01:18:16,418 --> 01:18:18,750
I’ll be.

1016
01:18:18,821 --> 01:18:22,313
That boy, he’s my friend.

1017
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:25,487
He likes the way I talk,
and I like the way he talks.

1018
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,264
I knew you were gonna be all right.

1019
01:18:29,336 --> 01:18:31,896
I just wanna check on you.

1020
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:35,875
I’m gonna tell Bill good-bye
and head on back.

1021
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:37,878
All right, then.

1022
01:18:42,788 --> 01:18:45,450
Karl, see if you can
figure out what’s wrong with this thing.

1023
01:18:45,525 --> 01:18:48,756
It won’t crank up. Everything seems
to be put together right.

1024
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:51,354
– Bill, I’ll see you.
– Okay. Stop back by.

1025
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:54,561
Don’t worry about your boy.
He’s doing good.

1026
01:18:55,438 --> 01:18:58,635
It ain’t got no gas in it.

1027
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:02,510
You see there, Scooter.
Thinks of the simplest things first.

1028
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:07,580
– Does everybody like the food?
– Yeah.

1029
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:10,921
Good. I haven’t decided yet
if I’m a good cook.

1030
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,058
Karl, you know what?

1031
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:19,934
Melinda was voted employee of the month
at the Dollar Store last February.

1032
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:22,736
Isn’t that something?

1033
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,936
Yes, ma’am. I reckon.

1034
01:19:25,012 --> 01:19:28,743
When you like pricing items
as much as I do…

1035
01:19:28,818 --> 01:19:32,447
it’s just bound to happen
sooner or later, I guess.

1036
01:19:34,393 --> 01:19:39,297
Maybe you and Melinda
might like to take a walk tonight.

1037
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:42,359
– It’s such a nice evening.
– Vaughan, don’t get pushy.

1038
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,562
I’m sorry.

1039
01:19:45,742 --> 01:19:49,041
I kind of like walking
from time to time.

1040
01:19:49,113 --> 01:19:51,877
I stay on my feet all the time at work.

1041
01:19:51,983 --> 01:19:55,419
I just can’t find shoes
that’s comfortable.

1042
01:19:55,489 --> 01:19:59,687
Hospital shoes might be the answer.
Nurse’s shoes.

1043
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:02,322
Or the kind old ladies wear
who work in school cafeterias.

1044
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:05,196
Same difference.

1045
01:20:05,268 --> 01:20:07,998
I get real mean when my feet hurt.

1046
01:20:08,073 --> 01:20:11,440
It’s the only time
I don’t like checking out customers.

1047
01:20:11,511 --> 01:20:14,036
When my feet hurt.

1048
01:20:14,115 --> 01:20:16,549
You and Karl aren’t talking much.

1049
01:20:16,618 --> 01:20:19,451
You boys must really like that food.

1050
01:20:19,522 --> 01:20:22,650
Well, I ain’t got nothing to say
about shoes.

1051
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,160
Listen, everybody.

1052
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:28,028
This might sound corny, but –

1053
01:20:29,436 --> 01:20:32,371
I’ve had some wine
and that tends to make me emotional…

1054
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,430
but I’m gonna say it anyway.

1055
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:37,138
It came over me in a rush.

1056
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:39,703
I just want you all to know…

1057
01:20:39,784 --> 01:20:44,916
that I care about
each and every person at this table.

1058
01:20:44,991 --> 01:20:47,151
Thank you.
That’s really sweet of you.

1059
01:20:47,227 --> 01:20:49,491
We care about you too.
Don’t we, y’all?

1060
01:20:49,597 --> 01:20:51,029
Yeah.

1061
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:56,004
Also, please don’t tell anyone
at the store…

1062
01:20:56,072 --> 01:20:58,198
that Albert was here tonight.

1063
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:04,745
Why?

1064
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:07,310
You know how this town is.
People talk…

1065
01:21:07,389 --> 01:21:10,790
and they spread cruel rumours.

1066
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:16,163
Unfortunately, there’s certain parts
of my life I have to keep private.

1067
01:21:16,234 --> 01:21:21,002
You mean about you and Albert
being together in that way?

1068
01:21:21,074 --> 01:21:24,532
– Yes.
– I think everybody already knows.

1069
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:26,979
They’re always talking about it.

1070
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:30,348
Maureen Ledbetter told
the most awful story…

1071
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:33,981
about why you ain’t allowed
at the First Baptist Church no more.

1072
01:21:34,092 --> 01:21:37,687
Karl, why don’t you and Melinda
take a walk? It’s nice out.

1073
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,604
All right, then.

1074
01:21:55,955 --> 01:21:57,922
That sure was quick.

1075
01:22:05,402 --> 01:22:07,335
You walk fast, don’t you?

1076
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:09,303
I reckon.

1077
01:22:11,076 --> 01:22:13,544
These are the worst shoes I own
for walking.

1078
01:22:14,615 --> 01:22:17,413
How far’d you say you want to go?

1079
01:22:17,486 --> 01:22:21,183
I don’t reckon
I thought about it too much.

1080
01:22:22,493 --> 01:22:23,226
I don’t know.
She just ain’t catching fire.

1081
01:22:23,227 --> 01:22:26,219
I don’t know.
She just ain’t catching fire.

1082
01:22:26,298 --> 01:22:28,527
Did you check them points?

1083
01:22:29,602 --> 01:22:32,127
No, I didn’t.

1084
01:22:32,205 --> 01:22:34,503
That’s probably it.

1085
01:22:36,245 --> 01:22:38,713
– Yes, ma’am?
– Is Karl here?

1086
01:22:38,782 --> 01:22:40,908
Yes. Just a minute.

1087
01:22:44,056 --> 01:22:46,547
Karl. There’s somebody out here
to see you.

1088
01:22:46,626 --> 01:22:49,595
Some gal holding a nice bouquet.

1089
01:22:49,663 --> 01:22:54,100
Come on out. She wants to talk to you.
Don’t just sit there.

1090
01:23:07,855 --> 01:23:11,621
Hi. I’m on my lunch break.

1091
01:23:11,694 --> 01:23:13,627
These are on sale
’cause they’re not fresh.

1092
01:23:14,598 --> 01:23:19,901
Two ninety-nine a bunch, plus
my ten percent employee discount.

1093
01:23:19,971 --> 01:23:24,534
Since I didn’t bring nothing for you
on our date last night…

1094
01:23:24,611 --> 01:23:27,045
I thought you might like to have them.

1095
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,027
Thank you.

1096
01:23:37,062 --> 01:23:40,828
Scooter, let’s go over to the Frosty
Cream and pick up something for lunch.

1097
01:23:40,934 --> 01:23:42,662
I can go.
You don’t have to.

1098
01:23:42,771 --> 01:23:45,604
– You don’t never go.
– Goddammit, Scooter. Let’s go.

1099
01:23:46,675 --> 01:23:48,608
Pardon my language, ma’am.

1100
01:24:04,634 --> 01:24:07,694
Well, I just thought I’d bring them.

1101
01:24:08,773 --> 01:24:10,967
I liked walking with you.

1102
01:24:11,077 --> 01:24:14,376
I got a blister the size of a quarter
on one heel.

1103
01:24:16,717 --> 01:24:20,380
Well, I’ll see you sometime, I guess.

1104
01:24:26,431 --> 01:24:28,831
Blisters sure can hurt.

1105
01:24:31,071 --> 01:24:32,503
Yeah.

1106
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:38,868
Flowers is pretty.

1107
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:41,280
I’ve always thought that.

1108
01:24:44,123 --> 01:24:46,056
Me too.

1109
01:25:36,295 --> 01:25:39,594
Hey, Karl.
How’d you know I was in the garage?

1110
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:44,969
I seen that door cracked open a little.
I figured you was in there.

1111
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,565
– You off of work?
– Yes, sir.

1112
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:50,373
Where’d you get them flowers?

1113
01:25:50,447 --> 01:25:53,780
That gal that made employee of the month
at the Dollar Store.

1114
01:25:53,852 --> 01:25:56,844
She gave them to me
for walking with her.

1115
01:25:58,359 --> 01:26:00,793
I was going over to the secret place.

1116
01:26:00,862 --> 01:26:04,059
I borrowed one of your books.
You ain’t mad, are you?

1117
01:26:04,132 --> 01:26:07,033
No, sir. You can look at every one
of my books you want to.

1118
01:26:07,103 --> 01:26:10,436
Thank you.
It’s name’s “A Christmas Carol.”

1119
01:26:10,508 --> 01:26:13,500
That’s that one on Christmas
I was telling you about.

1120
01:26:14,581 --> 01:26:16,514
You wanna go with me?

1121
01:26:17,585 --> 01:26:19,518
All right, then.

1122
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:21,954
– Yeah. Come on.
– All right.

1123
01:26:29,868 --> 01:26:32,028
Know why I want you
to play ball with me?

1124
01:26:32,138 --> 01:26:33,570
No.

1125
01:26:33,641 --> 01:26:37,042
’Cause it’s fun.
Don’t matter if you ain’t no good.

1126
01:26:37,113 --> 01:26:39,775
It takes your mind
off of everything else.

1127
01:26:39,882 --> 01:26:42,612
And when you’re trying to score
a touchdown…

1128
01:26:42,686 --> 01:26:44,778
that’s all you’re thinking about.

1129
01:26:44,856 --> 01:26:48,053
I ain’t no account,
but Daddy always said…

1130
01:26:48,128 --> 01:26:52,189
he was proud of me when I threw the ball
and ran with it.

1131
01:26:52,266 --> 01:26:56,703
Did you have any brothers and sisters
growing up to play with?

1132
01:26:56,772 --> 01:26:59,764
I had one there for a little bit.

1133
01:26:59,843 --> 01:27:01,207
But…

1134
01:27:02,314 --> 01:27:05,283
it didn’t get old enough
for me to play with it.

1135
01:27:05,384 --> 01:27:07,818
Why not? It die?

1136
01:27:07,921 --> 01:27:09,820
Yes, sir.

1137
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,323
Why?

1138
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:15,022
It got born a little too early.

1139
01:27:15,097 --> 01:27:19,694
My mother and father
made it come out too early.

1140
01:27:20,772 --> 01:27:23,138
So it died when it come out?

1141
01:27:24,545 --> 01:27:28,481
My daddy come out to the shed
and got me…

1142
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:30,483
said, “Here. Take this
and throw it away.”

1143
01:27:30,553 --> 01:27:33,886
He handed me a towel
with something or another in it.

1144
01:27:37,095 --> 01:27:39,028
I started for that barrel…

1145
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,297
and I opened up the towel
’cause there was a noise…

1146
01:27:44,372 --> 01:27:46,498
and something moving around in it.

1147
01:27:48,378 --> 01:27:52,405
That towel was all bloody-like
all around it there.

1148
01:27:57,189 --> 01:28:01,387
It was a little old baby,
not no bigger than a squirrel.

1149
01:28:02,263 --> 01:28:04,321
It was alive?

1150
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,028
Yes, sir.
Right then it was.

1151
01:28:08,738 --> 01:28:10,295
A boy or girl?

1152
01:28:11,609 --> 01:28:14,043
It was a little old boy.

1153
01:28:15,882 --> 01:28:18,350
You threw it in the trash barrel?

1154
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:21,984
That didn’t seem right to me.

1155
01:28:22,057 --> 01:28:24,355
So I went into the shed
and got a shoe box…

1156
01:28:24,428 --> 01:28:27,090
and emptied out the screwdrivers,
washers and nuts…

1157
01:28:27,164 --> 01:28:29,028
and things out of it.

1158
01:28:30,335 --> 01:28:33,532
I taken the little feller
and put him in the box…

1159
01:28:33,606 --> 01:28:36,598
buried him in the corner of the yard.

1160
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:40,045
That seemed more proper to me,
I reckon.

1161
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:43,281
It was still alive when you buried it?

1162
01:28:44,622 --> 01:28:47,420
I heard it crying a little
through that box.

1163
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:56,434
That don’t seem right. It seems like
you would have took care of him…

1164
01:28:56,505 --> 01:28:58,597
if he was your brother.

1165
01:28:58,675 --> 01:29:00,801
I wasn’t but six or eight.

1166
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:04,245
I reckon I didn’t know
what to do.

1167
01:29:04,316 --> 01:29:06,510
I didn’t know how to care
for no baby.

1168
01:29:07,687 --> 01:29:10,155
My mother and father didn’t want him.

1169
01:29:11,593 --> 01:29:14,187
They learned me to do
what they told me to do.

1170
01:29:15,799 --> 01:29:19,496
I figure it probably best we give him
right back to the good Lord…

1171
01:29:19,571 --> 01:29:21,663
right off the bat anyhow.

1172
01:29:22,975 --> 01:29:25,876
That makes me feel real sad.

1173
01:29:26,981 --> 01:29:29,141
Couldn’t you have done something?

1174
01:29:29,217 --> 01:29:31,845
I would have.
I wish I’d had him.

1175
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:35,755
He’d still be right here, now.
Living.

1176
01:29:36,761 --> 01:29:38,785
It makes me sad too.

1177
01:29:40,132 --> 01:29:43,101
I wish there was something
I could have did about it.

1178
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:49,598
I don’t think nothing bad
oughta happen to children.

1179
01:29:50,713 --> 01:29:53,181
I think all those bad things
oughta be saved up…

1180
01:29:53,284 --> 01:29:58,222
for the folks that done growed up,
that’s the way I see it.

1181
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:03,621
I shouldn’t have told you about that.

1182
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:07,223
Boy your age ought not
to hear such things.

1183
01:30:07,304 --> 01:30:09,932
It just kind of come out.

1184
01:30:10,007 --> 01:30:13,135
I didn’t mean to say nothing
bad about you.

1185
01:30:13,211 --> 01:30:17,238
You’re good.
You don’t mean no harm.

1186
01:30:17,317 --> 01:30:21,651
You ever think about killing yourself
on purpose, like Daddy did?

1187
01:30:24,493 --> 01:30:26,757
I studied about it some.

1188
01:30:27,865 --> 01:30:29,923
Bible says you ought not to.

1189
01:30:31,838 --> 01:30:35,171
Says you do that,
you go off to Hades.

1190
01:30:35,241 --> 01:30:38,267
Some folks call it hell.
I call it Hades.

1191
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:43,243
Bible says the same thing
about killing others too.

1192
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,430
Yes, sir.
I reckon it does.

1193
01:31:12,894 --> 01:31:16,386
Spend more time over here –

1194
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:19,368
Well, hell.
There’s the boys.

1195
01:31:19,437 --> 01:31:22,133
How you doing?
Glad you all came back.

1196
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:26,875
I was wanting to talk to y’all.
Come sit down.

1197
01:31:26,947 --> 01:31:28,880
Come on. Sit down.

1198
01:31:28,949 --> 01:31:33,944
I was just telling Linda –
We were thinking that things…

1199
01:31:34,023 --> 01:31:37,925
would be a lot better if I spent
more time over here.

1200
01:31:37,996 --> 01:31:42,764
And if we could –
Hell, I’ll just start over.

1201
01:31:42,836 --> 01:31:47,433
I took off work early today, and your
mama did the same, so we could talk.

1202
01:31:48,543 --> 01:31:51,876
Really what I came over here to do
was apologize –

1203
01:31:51,948 --> 01:31:54,074
which ain’t easy for me –

1204
01:31:54,151 --> 01:31:56,380
about how I acted the other night.

1205
01:31:57,657 --> 01:31:59,385
I admit it.
I was drunk.

1206
01:32:00,661 --> 01:32:04,563
I got all worked up
and one thing led to another.

1207
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:10,070
I care about you all, though.
I do.

1208
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:13,871
I don’t mean to be so damned –

1209
01:32:13,946 --> 01:32:16,938
well, asshole-ish,
I guess would be the word.

1210
01:32:18,052 --> 01:32:21,180
Karl, I don’t believe I hit you,
did I?

1211
01:32:21,256 --> 01:32:24,316
So no apology necessary, I guess.

1212
01:32:24,392 --> 01:32:26,724
But, Frankie, I’m sorry.

1213
01:32:26,796 --> 01:32:29,162
I’m sorry I hit your mama.

1214
01:32:30,235 --> 01:32:33,068
It’s just that I’m jealous of her.

1215
01:32:33,139 --> 01:32:36,006
I don’t like her life
or how she lives it.

1216
01:32:37,178 --> 01:32:39,202
I don’t like homosexuals.

1217
01:32:39,314 --> 01:32:43,877
And she goes out and buddies
up with one, so I gotta deal with that.

1218
01:32:43,987 --> 01:32:46,956
I don’t like wimpy-ass kids
or mental retards…

1219
01:32:47,057 --> 01:32:49,457
and she got one of each
living with her.

1220
01:32:51,164 --> 01:32:53,655
I’m just kidding about that.

1221
01:32:55,103 --> 01:32:56,967
I mean, we all got to get along…

1222
01:32:57,039 --> 01:32:59,564
no matter what our differences are.

1223
01:33:00,876 --> 01:33:03,208
See, I work construction.

1224
01:33:03,281 --> 01:33:05,248
I build things.

1225
01:33:05,316 --> 01:33:08,479
You understand how important that is
to the world, Frankie?

1226
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:14,459
I don’t know if you realize
the pressure a man like me’s got on him.

1227
01:33:15,865 --> 01:33:19,494
The upshot is, I’m gonna be spending
a lot more time here.

1228
01:33:19,603 --> 01:33:22,538
We’re gonna all get along
like a family should.

1229
01:33:24,076 --> 01:33:27,512
I might even surprise you
and pop the question.

1230
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:34,254
Well.

1231
01:33:34,324 --> 01:33:37,816
I’m gonna get on back over
to the job site…

1232
01:33:37,895 --> 01:33:39,828
lock up some stuff over there.

1233
01:33:39,898 --> 01:33:45,804
I just wanted to stop by and give y’all
a little piece of happiness today.

1234
01:33:45,873 --> 01:33:47,134
Bye-bye.

1235
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,844
You be a good boy now.
Hear me?

1236
01:34:02,663 --> 01:34:06,360
Well, at least he’s trying…

1237
01:34:06,434 --> 01:34:08,959
but who knows for how long.

1238
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:12,941
He’s lying, Mama.
He’ll never do better.

1239
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:15,274
I know, honey.

1240
01:34:16,849 --> 01:34:20,012
Just remember what I said.
We’ll bide our time.

1241
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:24,217
You just steer clear of him
as much as you can.

1242
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:28,092
Doyle’s had a hard life.
It’s just about run him crazy.

1243
01:34:29,099 --> 01:34:32,466
We had hard lives too, Mama.

1244
01:34:34,941 --> 01:34:37,739
You’re a hell of a boy, Frank.

1245
01:34:39,347 --> 01:34:44,115
Someday, you’re gonna get
all the good things you deserve.

1246
01:34:44,187 --> 01:34:48,784
Karl’s gonna get some more biscuits
tonight. What do you think about that?

1247
01:34:50,028 --> 01:34:52,326
I could sure use some.

1248
01:34:59,909 --> 01:35:02,673
Karl, come unload
a generator for me.

1249
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,694
Lift this thing down
and carry it to the back.

1250
01:35:17,767 --> 01:35:20,668
– It’s on the blink.
– You want us to help you lift that?

1251
01:35:20,738 --> 01:35:23,332
No. That Karl’s strong enough
to lift a bulldozer.

1252
01:35:23,408 --> 01:35:26,036
He can fix anything too.

1253
01:35:26,112 --> 01:35:29,172
He’s mentally retarded, but he’s a whiz
at small engines.

1254
01:35:30,284 --> 01:35:33,481
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1255
01:35:33,589 --> 01:35:37,081
What I was telling you was,
he didn’t just make the team…

1256
01:35:37,194 --> 01:35:41,130
Coach says he’s gonna
start him at end on defence.

1257
01:35:41,232 --> 01:35:43,792
Guy’s a chip off the old block,
ain’t you, Steve?

1258
01:35:43,903 --> 01:35:46,997
– I guess so.
– How’s the rest of the team look?

1259
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:49,303
Pretty good.
We expect to do well.

1260
01:35:49,377 --> 01:35:53,074
– Got a quarterback this year?
– Jeff Bailey’s boy. You know him.

1261
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:56,142
– Got a good arm. A little slow.
– I watched him in junior high.

1262
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:58,848
He throws the ball pretty well.
He’s taller now.

1263
01:35:58,924 --> 01:36:00,754
You gonna start at the defensive end?

1264
01:36:00,826 --> 01:36:02,816
Hup!

1265
01:36:03,897 --> 01:36:05,625
Come on, man!

1266
01:36:12,309 --> 01:36:14,538
Good job, Karl.
We got a touchdown.

1267
01:36:15,815 --> 01:36:17,748
That was a good lateral.

1268
01:36:17,817 --> 01:36:19,841
That was just like the wishbone.

1269
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:24,821
Yes, sir.
I darned near made me a touchdown.

1270
01:36:24,893 --> 01:36:26,757
Then I seen them boys
bearing down on me.

1271
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:30,391
Figured I better give it off
to you. I seen you following me.

1272
01:36:30,468 --> 01:36:34,234
We liable to win
if we keep this up.

1273
01:36:34,307 --> 01:36:37,401
For somebody like you,
you sure can run fast.

1274
01:36:37,477 --> 01:36:40,969
– Come on. Let’s kick off to them.
– All right, then.

1275
01:36:46,089 --> 01:36:48,649
I know you could have
scored that touchdown by yourself…

1276
01:36:48,759 --> 01:36:51,387
instead of throwing it over to me.

1277
01:36:51,464 --> 01:36:55,161
Them boys was trying to pull me down
pretty hard.

1278
01:36:55,235 --> 01:36:57,931
You’re strong.
You just threw it to me…

1279
01:36:58,005 --> 01:37:00,997
where I could score that touchdown
so I’d feel good.

1280
01:37:01,077 --> 01:37:03,944
My daddy used to do
that kind of thing.

1281
01:37:06,584 --> 01:37:09,883
It don’t matter to me about us losing.
Does it to you?

1282
01:37:09,956 --> 01:37:11,752
No, sir.

1283
01:37:11,825 --> 01:37:13,815
It was fun anyhow.

1284
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:18,491
I wasn’t thinking about nothing else,
just like you told me I’d do.

1285
01:37:18,568 --> 01:37:20,968
Can we play every Saturday?

1286
01:37:21,071 --> 01:37:23,004
If I ain’t too stove up.

1287
01:37:23,074 --> 01:37:25,907
I ain’t like you.
I’m old and give out.

1288
01:37:29,216 --> 01:37:32,151
I’m proud of you.

1289
01:39:46,473 --> 01:39:49,806
I’d kick your head in
25 years ago.

1290
01:39:49,877 --> 01:39:53,836
You’re dead, I guess.
Where’d you go to?

1291
01:39:56,486 --> 01:39:59,455
I know, Mother. That’s kind of sad.
I was drunk when I did it.

1292
01:40:13,143 --> 01:40:15,076
I’m your boy.

1293
01:40:18,483 --> 01:40:20,416
I ain’t got no boy.

1294
01:40:23,724 --> 01:40:26,693
I’m your oldest boy,
name of Karl.

1295
01:40:26,762 --> 01:40:28,626
I ain’t got no boy.

1296
01:40:31,701 --> 01:40:34,135
They turned me loose
from the nervous hospital.

1297
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:36,536
Said I was well.

1298
01:40:45,421 --> 01:40:50,985
I got hired on to work for Mr. Bill Cox,
fixing lawn mowers and whatnot.

1299
01:40:54,066 --> 01:40:57,729
That grass out there in the yard
growed up quite a bit.

1300
01:40:57,805 --> 01:40:59,999
I figured I might cut it for you.

1301
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:06,539
I told you I ain’t got no boy.
Get on out of here and let me be.

1302
01:41:06,617 --> 01:41:09,450
You ain’t no kin to me.

1303
01:41:12,992 --> 01:41:15,290
I learned to read some.

1304
01:41:18,901 --> 01:41:20,993
I read the Bible quite a bit.

1305
01:41:27,379 --> 01:41:29,437
I can’t understand all of it.

1306
01:41:29,516 --> 01:41:33,077
But I reckon I understand
a good deal of it.

1307
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:37,249
Them stories you and Mama told me,
they ain’t in there.

1308
01:41:39,463 --> 01:41:42,626
You ought not done that to your boy.

1309
01:41:44,369 --> 01:41:47,099
I studied on killing you.

1310
01:41:48,041 --> 01:41:50,099
I studied about it quite a bit.

1311
01:41:55,218 --> 01:41:57,686
But I reckon there’s no need for it
if all you’re gonna do…

1312
01:41:57,755 --> 01:42:00,849
is sit there in that chair.

1313
01:42:00,926 --> 01:42:03,918
You’ll be dead soon enough.

1314
01:42:03,996 --> 01:42:06,624
And the world’ll be shut of you.

1315
01:42:14,745 --> 01:42:17,805
You ought not kill my little brother.

1316
01:42:20,852 --> 01:42:23,320
He ought of had
a chance to growed up.

1317
01:42:25,994 --> 01:42:29,259
He would have had fun sometime.

1318
01:43:03,045 --> 01:43:04,978
Little feller.

1319
01:44:16,446 --> 01:44:21,146
What the goddamn hell
you doing up in the middle of the night?

1320
01:44:21,254 --> 01:44:23,050
What you want, hon?

1321
01:44:23,156 --> 01:44:25,123
I wanna be baptised.

1322
01:44:25,226 --> 01:44:27,694
Get baptised. then.
I don’t give a shit!

1323
01:44:27,762 --> 01:44:31,254
Call up a fucking preacher!
We can’t baptise you.

1324
01:44:31,334 --> 01:44:34,792
We’ll go see Brother Epersom tomorrow
and get you baptised.

1325
01:44:34,873 --> 01:44:38,365
It’s Sunday.
You go on back to bed now.

1326
01:44:40,147 --> 01:44:42,239
What are you doing
with that damn hammer?

1327
01:44:46,455 --> 01:44:49,856
I don’t rightly know.
I just woke up holding it.

1328
01:44:59,006 --> 01:45:01,839
– What’s he’s doing with that hammer?
– I don’t know.

1329
01:45:24,073 --> 01:45:28,373
Upon his profession of faith
in our Lord Jesus Christ…

1330
01:45:28,446 --> 01:45:31,006
in obedience under His command…

1331
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:33,380
and by the authority of this church…

1332
01:45:33,453 --> 01:45:36,684
I indeed baptise this brother…

1333
01:45:36,758 --> 01:45:39,625
in the name of the Father
and the Son…

1334
01:45:39,695 --> 01:45:41,628
and the Holy Ghost.

1335
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:46,632
Amen.

1336
01:45:46,705 --> 01:45:49,265
Marie, would you sing 137, please?

1337
01:45:50,644 --> 01:45:53,807
Softly and tenderly

1338
01:45:53,883 --> 01:45:56,852
Jesus is calling

1339
01:45:57,953 --> 01:46:03,358
Calling for you and for me

1340
01:46:09,103 --> 01:46:11,901
– How’d the baptising go?
– Real good.

1341
01:46:11,974 --> 01:46:13,907
Yeah? Good.

1342
01:46:14,977 --> 01:46:17,206
I’m kind of hungry.

1343
01:46:17,281 --> 01:46:19,909
Isn’t it about time to eat?

1344
01:46:19,984 --> 01:46:24,011
You know what I got a crave for?
Some of that Chicken Champ.

1345
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:26,786
Why don’t you run down and get some?
I’ll buy.

1346
01:46:26,861 --> 01:46:28,760
Would y’all like that?

1347
01:46:28,830 --> 01:46:30,763
It sounds fine to me.

1348
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:33,825
I’d value me a chicken leg or two.

1349
01:46:36,206 --> 01:46:40,336
– Get some of their cole slaw too.
– Okay. Y’all wanna go with me?

1350
01:46:40,413 --> 01:46:42,779
They don’t need to go with you.
There’s a ball game coming on.

1351
01:46:42,849 --> 01:46:47,081
– We’ll sit here and do man things.
– I’ll be back in a little bit.

1352
01:46:47,156 --> 01:46:50,284
– All right. Get some extra gravy.
– Okay.

1353
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,925
Why don’t y’all
sit your asses down here.

1354
01:46:59,005 --> 01:47:00,938
Sit down.

1355
01:47:13,559 --> 01:47:17,586
I just wanted to get your mama
out of the house so we could talk.

1356
01:47:29,214 --> 01:47:31,147
Here’s the deal, Frank.

1357
01:47:34,121 --> 01:47:37,557
If I’m gonna throw my life away
to come live with y’all…

1358
01:47:40,063 --> 01:47:42,793
we’re gonna get some shit straight.

1359
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:47,064
Your mama and I don’t have no problems
except for you.

1360
01:47:47,172 --> 01:47:50,573
Fact is, we never have
a bad word between us.

1361
01:47:50,643 --> 01:47:52,837
But since you do exist…

1362
01:47:52,913 --> 01:47:55,711
and I’m gonna be
the head of the household…

1363
01:47:55,784 --> 01:47:58,150
you’re gonna learn
to live by my rules.

1364
01:47:58,221 --> 01:48:02,248
The first rule is: You don’t speak
unless you’re spoken to.

1365
01:48:02,326 --> 01:48:03,952
You got me?

1366
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:08,158
Now you stay
the hell out of my way.

1367
01:48:08,234 --> 01:48:10,896
And do what a regular kid does.

1368
01:48:11,005 --> 01:48:14,805
You’re a weird little shit, Frank.
And I don’t get you.

1369
01:48:14,877 --> 01:48:19,406
So wake up
and face what they call reality.

1370
01:48:20,351 --> 01:48:22,284
We’re gonna be a family.

1371
01:48:22,353 --> 01:48:24,787
My family.

1372
01:48:24,857 --> 01:48:27,519
I’ll be paying all the bills.

1373
01:48:27,595 --> 01:48:30,325
So that means,
you’re stuck with my ass…

1374
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:32,332
but I ain’t your daddy.

1375
01:48:33,403 --> 01:48:35,928
You just act like I am.

1376
01:48:36,006 --> 01:48:37,973
The other thing I say is…

1377
01:48:38,043 --> 01:48:40,010
your buddy Karl is going.

1378
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:44,241
We can’t be no normal family
with him living in the garage…

1379
01:48:44,318 --> 01:48:47,412
and coming in the bedroom
at 4:00 in the morning with hammers.

1380
01:48:47,489 --> 01:48:49,957
Karl could stay if he wants to.
Mama said –

1381
01:48:50,025 --> 01:48:51,958
What I tell you about your mama?

1382
01:48:52,028 --> 01:48:55,429
Mister, don’t you never
lay another hand on that boy.

1383
01:48:55,501 --> 01:48:58,527
– You understand me?
– Let go of my hand, you retard.

1384
01:48:58,604 --> 01:49:02,040
Get out there!
Get your shit and get out!

1385
01:49:04,212 --> 01:49:07,204
That’s a wake-up call, Frankie.

1386
01:49:07,283 --> 01:49:09,409
You remember what I said
about reality!

1387
01:49:10,488 --> 01:49:12,421
Get out, retard.

1388
01:49:38,293 --> 01:49:42,059
Where you going?
Didn’t you want some chicken and things?

1389
01:49:42,132 --> 01:49:45,397
No, ma’am.
I’m going off somewheres.

1390
01:49:45,469 --> 01:49:48,165
Well, okay.
I got you some.

1391
01:49:48,273 --> 01:49:50,502
Frank – he went off somewheres too.

1392
01:49:50,577 --> 01:49:53,011
So when you go in there,
he won’t be indoors.

1393
01:49:53,079 --> 01:49:55,069
Where did he go?
What’s going on?

1394
01:49:55,149 --> 01:49:57,879
He just wanted to go play, I reckon.

1395
01:49:57,987 --> 01:49:59,954
You go in and eat
with that Doyle…

1396
01:50:00,022 --> 01:50:02,582
and don’t worry yourself none.

1397
01:50:02,694 --> 01:50:04,661
All right, then.

1398
01:50:04,730 --> 01:50:06,663
Well, I’ll see you later.

1399
01:50:06,732 --> 01:50:08,756
If you see Frank,
tell him to come home.

1400
01:50:08,835 --> 01:50:10,995
I don’t get to see him
except Sundays.

1401
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:13,767
He can go play tomorrow.

1402
01:50:13,842 --> 01:50:15,775
– Ma’am?
– Yeah?

1403
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:22,910
You’re a good mama to that boy.

1404
01:50:23,022 --> 01:50:25,114
You care for him.

1405
01:50:25,225 --> 01:50:28,126
You work hard to care for him.

1406
01:50:28,195 --> 01:50:30,755
You light him up in his eyes.

1407
01:50:30,865 --> 01:50:32,798
I’ve seen it.

1408
01:50:34,003 --> 01:50:37,666
That boy wouldn’t know what to do
without you.

1409
01:50:37,742 --> 01:50:40,233
Thank you.
That’s real good of you to say.

1410
01:50:40,312 --> 01:50:43,008
I wouldn’t know what to do
without him either.

1411
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:45,677
You been real good to me too.

1412
01:50:45,754 --> 01:50:50,088
It ain’t everybody that’d make biscuits
in the middle of the night.

1413
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:53,094
You and that boy’s
given me a good feeling.

1414
01:50:54,164 --> 01:50:56,826
We sure like having you.

1415
01:50:56,902 --> 01:50:58,835
Thank you.

1416
01:51:00,607 --> 01:51:03,633
I’m just now getting around
to telling you –

1417
01:51:03,745 --> 01:51:08,205
But I fixed that washing machine so that
boy ain’t gotta tote laundry no more.

1418
01:51:08,318 --> 01:51:10,444
Thank you.

1419
01:51:16,228 --> 01:51:18,161
You been real good to me.

1420
01:51:35,422 --> 01:51:38,323
Hey, Karl.
How’d you know I’d come out here?

1421
01:51:38,393 --> 01:51:41,885
I knowed you’d be out here.

1422
01:51:41,997 --> 01:51:44,557
What you doing
digging with that stub?

1423
01:51:44,668 --> 01:51:47,796
Just digging.
I ain’t never gonna be happy now.

1424
01:51:47,905 --> 01:51:51,397
Not with that son-of-a-bitch
moving in for good.

1425
01:51:51,478 --> 01:51:54,379
I wish me and you and Mama
would just run away.

1426
01:51:54,448 --> 01:51:56,712
She said…

1427
01:51:56,785 --> 01:51:59,219
wherever we went,
he’d find us.

1428
01:51:59,287 --> 01:52:04,487
He’s crazy. Sometimes I think it’d been
better off if I wasn’t even born.

1429
01:52:05,563 --> 01:52:08,031
I’m glad of it
you was borned.

1430
01:52:11,037 --> 01:52:14,768
I don’t reckon I’m gonna be out there
in the garage no more.

1431
01:52:14,843 --> 01:52:17,607
You have to.
You have to look out for me.

1432
01:52:17,713 --> 01:52:20,443
You can’t let that
son-of-a-bitch run you off.

1433
01:52:20,551 --> 01:52:24,920
You just a boy.
You ought not use language like that.

1434
01:52:26,092 --> 01:52:28,561
I don’t mean to say nothing
bad about you…

1435
01:52:28,562 --> 01:52:32,396
but why don’t you stop Doyle
when he’s being that way?

1436
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:36,061
You’re older than him.
You’re strong too.

1437
01:52:37,507 --> 01:52:41,500
My daddy wouldn’t let him
do that to me and Mama.

1438
01:52:43,349 --> 01:52:46,318
That feller’s a whole site
meaner than me.

1439
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:48,752
He’d just whup the tar out of me.

1440
01:52:48,824 --> 01:52:51,384
Yeah. I guess so.

1441
01:52:53,062 --> 01:52:55,222
I’m real tired,
you know that?

1442
01:52:56,668 --> 01:52:59,501
A boy my age shouldn’t
be tired of things.

1443
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:04,909
I’m tired too.

1444
01:53:07,917 --> 01:53:12,081
Just ’cause I ain’t gonna be
around no more, maybe…

1445
01:53:12,155 --> 01:53:14,623
that don’t mean
I don’t care for you.

1446
01:53:14,693 --> 01:53:16,991
I care for you a good deal.

1447
01:53:17,063 --> 01:53:20,123
I care for you more
than anything else there is.

1448
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,668
You and me made friends
right off the bat.

1449
01:53:23,772 --> 01:53:26,297
I care for you too.
But you’ll be around.

1450
01:53:26,409 --> 01:53:28,741
Don’t say that.

1451
01:53:28,813 --> 01:53:32,078
It don’t make no difference
where I was to be.

1452
01:53:32,149 --> 01:53:36,951
We’ll always be friends.
Can’t nobody stop that.

1453
01:53:46,871 --> 01:53:50,170
I aim for you to have these books.

1454
01:53:50,241 --> 01:53:53,142
You don’t wanna give away
all your books.

1455
01:53:53,246 --> 01:53:55,270
I aim for you to have them.

1456
01:54:04,094 --> 01:54:08,121
Maybe you can make more sense of them
than I can.

1457
01:54:08,199 --> 01:54:13,365
I made you a bookmarker and put it
in that book on Christmas.

1458
01:54:17,279 --> 01:54:19,212
Thanks.

1459
01:54:21,018 --> 01:54:24,647
You know when you got a feeling
and you don’t know why?

1460
01:54:24,723 --> 01:54:27,248
Yes, sir.

1461
01:54:27,327 --> 01:54:30,785
I got a feeling today.

1462
01:54:30,898 --> 01:54:33,731
Reckon, what kind of a feeling?

1463
01:54:33,836 --> 01:54:37,328
Like something different.
I don’t know.

1464
01:54:40,078 --> 01:54:42,045
You leaving, ain’t you?

1465
01:54:52,128 --> 01:54:55,495
Would you do something for me
if I was to ask you to?

1466
01:54:55,566 --> 01:54:59,093
You know I would.
Whatever you want.

1467
01:55:01,374 --> 01:55:03,534
When you leave outta here tonight…

1468
01:55:03,644 --> 01:55:07,546
I don’t want you going over there
and staying with that Doyle.

1469
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:14,856
He’s got it out for you tonight.
I got me a feeling too.

1470
01:55:14,926 --> 01:55:18,760
You ought not be over there
when he’s all liquored up and mean.

1471
01:55:18,831 --> 01:55:20,764
Your mama neither.

1472
01:55:21,835 --> 01:55:26,238
When you get up here and leave, I want
you to go to that feller’s house –

1473
01:55:26,308 --> 01:55:28,708
your mama’s friend.

1474
01:55:31,282 --> 01:55:34,479
I want you to give me your word on it.

1475
01:55:34,553 --> 01:55:37,454
Okay. I give you my word on it.

1476
01:55:39,059 --> 01:55:42,859
Is everything gonna be okay?
Are you all right?

1477
01:55:47,004 --> 01:55:50,735
Yeah, everything’s gonna be all right,
boy.

1478
01:55:58,252 --> 01:56:00,846
I kind of wanna put my arm
around you for a minute…

1479
01:56:00,923 --> 01:56:04,359
then I’m gonna get up
and leave out of here.

1480
01:56:32,333 --> 01:56:35,200
I love you, boy.

1481
01:56:36,773 --> 01:56:38,763
I love you too.

1482
01:56:42,615 --> 01:56:45,277
All right, then.

1483
01:57:25,339 --> 01:57:27,739
What are you doing here?
You wanna come in?

1484
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:32,339
I ain’t staying.
I need to ask you for a favour.

1485
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:37,753
This evening
I want you to go get Miss Wheatley…

1486
01:57:37,824 --> 01:57:41,954
and let her and Frank
stay over here with you tonight.

1487
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:44,590
What’s wrong?
Is everything all right?

1488
01:57:44,666 --> 01:57:46,860
That Doyle…

1489
01:57:46,936 --> 01:57:51,704
he’s in a bad way again with
that drinking and being mean to folks.

1490
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:54,210
I want you to give me your word
you’ll do it.

1491
01:57:54,313 --> 01:57:57,282
Sure. Okay.
He hasn’t hurt them, has he?

1492
01:57:57,352 --> 01:57:59,718
No, sir.
Not yet.

1493
01:58:00,788 --> 01:58:02,482
Here.

1494
01:58:02,558 --> 01:58:04,958
I want you to give that
to Miss Wheatley.

1495
01:58:05,028 --> 01:58:06,961
It ain’t much…

1496
01:58:07,031 --> 01:58:10,330
but they might be
a little something there to help out.

1497
01:58:10,402 --> 01:58:14,338
It’s what I made fixing lawn mowers
and whatnot for Bill Cox.

1498
01:58:15,944 --> 01:58:18,811
How about you, Karl?
You wanna stay here?

1499
01:58:20,216 --> 01:58:25,655
I don’t reckon that you have to go with
women to be a good daddy to a boy.

1500
01:58:25,690 --> 01:58:28,921
You been real square
dealing with me.

1501
01:58:28,995 --> 01:58:32,761
Bible says two men
ought not lay together.

1502
01:58:34,469 --> 01:58:40,102
But I bet you the good Lord
wouldn’t send nobody like you to Hades.

1503
01:58:41,512 --> 01:58:45,004
That boy – Frank –

1504
01:58:45,084 --> 01:58:48,349
he lives inside of his own heart.

1505
01:58:48,422 --> 01:58:51,289
That’s an awful big place to live in.

1506
01:58:53,228 --> 01:58:55,856
You take care of that boy.

1507
01:58:59,437 --> 01:59:02,133
I will.

1508
02:01:56,081 --> 02:01:58,048
Where’s everybody else?

1509
02:02:05,729 --> 02:02:07,662
You seen them?

1510
02:02:15,008 --> 02:02:18,535
Didn’t I tell you
to get moved out of here?

1511
02:02:21,985 --> 02:02:25,512
How does a feller go about
getting hold of the police?

1512
02:02:31,732 --> 02:02:34,496
Use the fucking phone, I guess.

1513
02:02:35,837 --> 02:02:38,101
Which numbers do you put in?

1514
02:02:46,352 --> 02:02:49,287
Can’t you see I’m trying to relax?

1515
02:02:51,558 --> 02:02:55,460
I thought I told you
to get out of here and leave me alone.

1516
02:03:00,638 --> 02:03:03,163
What the hell you doing
with that lawn mower blade?

1517
02:03:04,109 --> 02:03:06,577
I aim to kill you with it.

1518
02:03:20,131 --> 02:03:23,157
To call the police you push…

1519
02:03:23,236 --> 02:03:27,673
nine, one, one.

1520
02:03:32,916 --> 02:03:35,646
Just tell them
to bring an ambulance.

1521
02:03:38,725 --> 02:03:42,024
Or a “hearst,”
if you’re gonna kill me.

1522
02:04:41,678 --> 02:04:43,942
Yes, ma’am.

1523
02:04:44,015 --> 02:04:46,984
I need the police
sent over here to the Wheatley house.

1524
02:04:50,123 --> 02:04:55,357
I’ve killed Doyle Hargraves
with a lawn mower blade.

1525
02:04:55,431 --> 02:04:59,595
Yes, ma’am.
I’m right sure of it.

1526
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:02,332
I hit him
two good whacks with it.

1527
02:05:02,407 --> 02:05:06,741
That second one
just plumb near cut his head in two.

1528
02:05:10,051 --> 02:05:12,315
It’s a little old white house…

1529
02:05:12,387 --> 02:05:17,052
on the corner of Vine Street
and some other street.

1530
02:05:17,126 --> 02:05:22,429
There’s a truck out front, says
“Doyle Hargraves Construction” on it.

1531
02:05:25,105 --> 02:05:27,938
I’ll be sitting here
waiting on you.

1532
02:05:29,044 --> 02:05:32,707
And Doyle said
besides sending the police…

1533
02:05:32,782 --> 02:05:35,046
you might wanna send an ambulance…

1534
02:05:35,118 --> 02:05:37,484
or a “hearst.”

1535
02:05:39,091 --> 02:05:40,990
Thank you.

1536
02:06:44,716 --> 02:06:46,182
So…

1537
02:06:47,218 --> 02:06:51,120
now on the third day…

1538
02:06:51,191 --> 02:06:56,323
I washed her,
’cause she wasn’t too clean, you know.

1539
02:06:56,398 --> 02:06:59,196
But I got all the right spots.

1540
02:06:59,268 --> 02:07:01,201
She was the first one I ever kept…

1541
02:07:01,271 --> 02:07:06,300
’cause I get bored real easy –
I got a short attention span, you know.

1542
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:13,410
Now I can’t say
that she enjoyed her stay…

1543
02:07:15,959 --> 02:07:20,522
with that washcloth I put in her mouth
and held in place with duct tape.

1544
02:07:20,632 --> 02:07:22,599
Kept her complaining down to a minimum.

1545
02:07:22,668 --> 02:07:24,932
I don’t like people
who talk all the time.

1546
02:07:25,004 --> 02:07:27,472
I like to do all the talking.

1547
02:07:27,541 --> 02:07:30,567
That’s why I think I’m
so fond of you…

1548
02:07:30,645 --> 02:07:33,580
’cause you just so easygoing, you know.

1549
02:07:36,487 --> 02:07:41,050
Although, I do sense a little tension
in you from time to time.

1550
02:07:43,997 --> 02:07:46,966
So you were out in the world?

1551
02:07:48,537 --> 02:07:51,438
Did you have fun?
Did you make any acquaintances?

1552
02:07:52,509 --> 02:07:56,104
There was a boy.
We made friends.

1553
02:07:56,215 --> 02:07:58,148
I’ll bet you did.

1554
02:08:01,655 --> 02:08:06,252
I was never bent that way.
I was bent the other way.

1555
02:08:07,330 --> 02:08:09,126
So?

1556
02:08:10,701 --> 02:08:15,401
What was it like out there
in the world?

1557
02:08:16,676 --> 02:08:18,609
It was too big.

1558
02:08:21,816 --> 02:08:24,182
It’s not too big in here, is it?

1559
02:08:32,232 --> 02:08:35,065
You know something?

1560
02:08:35,135 --> 02:08:37,068
I feel real…

1561
02:08:38,172 --> 02:08:40,800
generous today –
I feel like listening.

1562
02:08:42,111 --> 02:08:44,579
I bet you got plenty to tell.

1563
02:08:50,457 --> 02:08:52,925
Who’d you kill?

1564
02:08:53,994 --> 02:08:56,292
Was it the boy?

1565
02:08:56,364 --> 02:08:59,561
Don’t you say nothing
about that boy.

1566
02:09:05,912 --> 02:09:10,372
Fact of business,
don’t you say another word to me.

1567
02:09:10,484 --> 02:09:13,715
I ain’t listening to you no more.

1568
02:09:28,475 --> 02:09:30,066
Yeah.
