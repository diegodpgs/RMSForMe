Directed by Akira Kurosawa

12
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:41,154
I don't understand...
I just don't understand.

13
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,864
I don't understand it at all.

14
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,302
I just don't understand.

15
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,062
What's wrong?

16
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,039
What don't you understand?

17
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,669
i've never heard
such a strange story.

18
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,038
Why don't you tell me about it?

19
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:16,111
We happen to have
a wise priest in our midst.

20
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:23,623
No, not even the renowned,
wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple

21
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,195
has heard a story
as strange as this.

22
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:32,666
So you know something
about this strange story?

23
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:38,343
This man and I have just seen it
and heard it ourselves.

24
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,541
- Where?
- In the courthouse garden.

25
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,481
The courthouse?

26
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,512
A man was murdered.

27
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,852
Just one? So what?

28
00:04:53,426 --> 00:05:00,628
On top of this gate, you'll find
at least five or six unclaimed bodies.

29
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,761
You're right.

30
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,466
War, earthquake, winds,

31
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:13,903
fire, famine, the plague...

32
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,243
Year after year,
it's been nothing but disasters.

33
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:27,087
And bandits descend upon us
every night.

34
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:36,100
i've seen so many men
getting killed like insects,

35
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:44,137
but even I have never heard
a story as horrible as this.

36
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,810
Yes. So horrible.

37
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:03,660
This time, I may finally lose
my faith in the human soul.

38
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:09,229
It's worse than bandits,
the plague,

39
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:16,039
famine, fire, or war.

40
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,544
Look here, priest.

41
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,440
Enough with the sermon.

42
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,348
It sounded interesting,
at least while I kept out of the rain.

43
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:31,012
But if it's a sermon,
I'd sooner listen to the rain.

44
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:08,227
Hear me out. Maybe you can
tell me what it means.

45
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,559
I don't understand
any of those three.

46
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,927
- Which three?
- Well...

47
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,862
I'll tell you about them.

48
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,336
Calm down and tell me slowly.

49
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,106
The rain's not going to stop
any time soon.

50
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,704
RASHOMON

51
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,330
It was three days ago.

52
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:52,868
I went into the mountains
to get wood.

53
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,259
I ran as fast as I could
to tell the police.

54
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:42,597
Then, three days later-- today--
I was called to testify.

55
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,900
Yes. That's right.

56
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:57,543
I was the one
who first found the body.

57
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,014
What? Did I see a sword
or something?

58
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,918
No, nothing at all.

59
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,956
Just a woman's hat
caught on a branch,

60
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,821
and the cap of a samurai
that had been trampled on.

61
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:18,196
There was a cut-up piece of rope
near the body,

62
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:27,207
and further along in the leaves,
a shiny amulet case with red lining.

63
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,007
Yes.

64
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:35,979
That was all I found, yes.

65
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,250
Yes.

66
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,761
I met the murdered man
before his death.

67
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:52,666
It was three days ago,
in the afternoon.

68
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,739
On the road from Sekiyama
to Yamashina.

69
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:23,258
The woman had a veil,
so I couldn't see her face.

70
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:31,205
The man was armed with a sword,
as well as a bow and arrows.

71
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:42,178
Little did I expect
that he would meet such a fate.

72
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:51,257
A human life is truly as frail
and feeting as the morning dew.

73
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,926
What a shame
that his should end this way.

74
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,862
I'm sorry.

75
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,047
This man I caught is Tajomaru.

76
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:15,277
Yes, the notorious bandit
everyone speaks of.

77
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:22,658
The last time I almost caught him,
he looked the same

78
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,228
and he carried that same sword.

79
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,865
It was two days ago at dusk,
by the banks of the Katsura...

80
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,755
What's wrong?

81
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,871
There were 17 arrows
with eagle feathers,

82
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:12,501
a leather bow, and a horse.

83
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,314
All these belonged
to the dead man, yes.

84
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:24,787
The irony of Tajomaru being
thrown off his stolen horse,

85
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,521
this had to be fateful retribution.

86
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:40,167
I fell off the horse?
You fool!

87
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,010
On that day...

88
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,848
I was riding that horse
and I was suddenly very thirsty.

89
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,418
So around Osaka,
I drank from a spring.

90
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,370
There must have been
a dead poisonous snake upstream.

91
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,174
After a while, I got
an incredible stomach ache.

92
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,575
By the time I came to the river,
I couldn't hold it any longer.

93
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,553
So I got off the horse
and crouched in the field.

94
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,096
I fell off?

95
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,360
Obviously, a fool can think only
foolish thoughts.

96
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,004
I know sooner or later
you'll have my neck,

97
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,168
so I'm not going to hide anything.

98
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,875
It was this Tajomaru
who killed that man.

99
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,714
I saw that couple three days ago.
It was a hot afternoon.

100
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,252
Suddenly a cool breeze
rustled the leaves.

101
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:15,395
If it hadn't been for that wind,
I wouldn't have killed him.

102
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,720
I caught a glimpse
and then she was gone.

103
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,691
Maybe that's why.

104
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,461
I thought I saw a goddess.

105
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,330
At that moment I decided to capture her,
even if I had to kill her man.

106
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,037
But if I could have her
without killing, all the better.

107
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:18,676
My intention then was to take her
without killing the man.

108
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,420
But I couldn't do it
on that road to Yamashina.

109
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,732
What do you want?

110
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,413
What do you want?

111
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,792
What is it?

112
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,351
Don't be suspicious.

113
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,054
See? Isn't this nice?

114
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,624
Take a good look at it.

115
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,537
There are some ruins over there.

116
00:21:54,579 --> 00:22:00,347
When I dug up the mound, I found
a heap of swords and mirrors.

117
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:05,147
I buried them in a grove behind the mountain
so no one else would find them.

118
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,086
If you're interested,
I'll sell them to you cheap.

119
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,189
It's over there.

120
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,323
Walk ahead of me.

121
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,108
It's here. Beyond those pines.

122
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,721
Your husband
has taken sick.

123
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:52,699
Her face turned pale.
She stared at me with frozen eyes,

124
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,640
her expression intense like a child's.

125
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:02,577
When I saw that, I envied the man
and I suddenly hated him.

126
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,585
I wanted to show her how pathetic
he looked tied to that pine tree.

127
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:12,495
These thoughts that weren't there
before filled my head.

128
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,824
I had never seen
such fierceness in a woman.

129
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:17,506
And so I had succeeded in having her
without killing her husband.

130
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,944
I still had no intention
of killing him.

131
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,277
But then...

132
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,951
Wait!

133
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,984
Stop!

134
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:42,456
Either you die or my husband dies.

135
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,463
One of you must die.

136
00:31:56,214 --> 00:32:01,481
To have my shame known to two men
is worse than dying.

137
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:13,161
I will go with the survivor.

138
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,441
So I had to kill him,
but I wanted to do it honorably.

139
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:16,378
He fought verywell.
We crossed swords 23 times.

140
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:22,279
I remember this
because I'm still impressed.

141
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,545
No one had ever crossed swords
with me more than 20 times.

142
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,656
What? The woman?

143
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,094
I don't know.

144
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:44,303
When the man died,
I turned to her. She was gone.

145
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,279
The fighting must have scared her
and she ran away.

146
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,909
I ran out to the mountain road.

147
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,054
All I found was her horse
grazing calmly.

148
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:02,523
I was attracted to her fierce spirit,

149
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:06,595
but, after all, she was just
like other women.

150
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,131
I didn't even look for her.

151
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,997
What? His sword?

152
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,466
I exchanged it in town for liquor.

153
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,012
What? Her dagger?

154
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:32,853
It had pearl inlay.
Looked very valuable.

155
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:38,955
I totally forgot about it.
That was foolish.

156
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,698
The biggest mistake I ever made!

157
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:09,721
Even amongst the bandits,
Tajomaru is famous for being a womanizer.

158
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:16,727
Why, last fall, a young wife went
to the temple and she and her maid

159
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:22,601
were found dead in the mountains.
That must have been him too.

160
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:33,950
Who knows what really happened
to that woman who left her horse?

161
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,388
Well, that woman showed up
at the courthouse.

162
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:52,861
She was hiding in the temple
when the police found her.

163
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,662
It's a lie.

164
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:59,203
It's all a lie.
Tajomaru's story and the woman's.

165
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,606
It's human to lie.

166
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:10,249
Most of the time we can't even
be honest with ourselves.

167
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,184
That may be.

168
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:26,729
But it's because men are weak
that they lie, even to themselves.

169
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,871
Not another sermon.

170
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:34,208
I don't care if it's a lie,
as long as it's entertaining.

171
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,611
What story did the woman
come up with?

172
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:45,788
Well, it's completely different
from Tajomaru's story.

173
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:55,521
So different that her face didn't even
show the fierceness he spoke of.

174
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,899
She was so docile,
she was almost pitiful.

175
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,030
That man in the blue kimono,

176
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,311
after forcing me to yield to him,

177
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:50,177
proudly announced that
he was the infamous Tajomaru,

178
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,725
and laughed mockingly at my husband
who was tied up.

179
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:16,508
How horrified my husband
must have been.

180
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,178
The more he struggled,

181
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:33,226
the tighter the ropes dug in.

182
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:42,932
I ran to his side. Or rather, I tried to.

183
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:37,243
Even now, when I think of his eyes,

184
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:42,658
my blood turns cold in my veins.

185
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:50,866
What I saw in them was neither anger,

186
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,803
nor sorrow,

187
00:42:55,372 --> 00:43:04,178
but a cold light, a look of loathing.

188
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,483
Don't.

189
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,452
Don't look at me like that.

190
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,896
It's too cruel.

191
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,728
Beat me,

192
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:34,474
kill me, but don't look at me like that.
Please, stop.

193
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,257
Now kill me.

194
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,732
Kill me at once.

195
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,359
Stop.

196
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,931
Don't.

197
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:50,604
Please don't.

198
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:40,394
I must have fainted after that.

199
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,533
When I came to
and looked around...

200
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,676
Imagine my shock.

201
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:28,741
I saw my dagger
in my dead husband's chest.

202
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,829
I was in shock

203
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,801
and I don't remember
how I left the woods.

204
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,272
But when I came to,

205
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,083
I was standing by the pond,

206
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,548
at the foot of the hill.

207
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,088
I threw myself into the pond.

208
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:26,258
I tried many different things.

209
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:32,439
But I failed to kill myself.

210
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:56,289
What should a poor,
helpless woman like me do?

211
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,268
I see. The more I hear,
the more confused I get.

212
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:41,405
But women use their tears
to fool everyone.

213
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,876
They even fool themselves.

214
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:48,714
So you have to beware
of the woman's story.

215
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,320
When you hear
the dead man's story--

216
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:59,287
He's dead.
How can he tell his story?

217
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,061
He spoke through a medium.

218
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,833
Lies. His story was also lies.

219
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,838
But dead men don't lie.

220
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,541
Why is that?

221
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,484
I refuse to believe
that man would be so sinful.

222
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,587
Suit yourself.

223
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,590
But is there anyone who's
really good?

224
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,360
Maybe goodness is just make-believe.

225
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,726
What a frightening--

226
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,025
Man just wants to forget
the bad stuff

227
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:41,130
and believe in the made-up
good stuff.

228
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,871
It's easier that way.
- Ridiculous.

229
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,269
Nevermind.

230
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,109
Let's hear the dead man's story.

231
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:43,062
I am in darkness now.

232
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:47,603
I am suffering in the dark.

233
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:53,307
Cursed be those who cast me
into this dark hell.

234
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:38,411
After the bandit attacked my wife,
he tried to console her.

235
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:45,290
She sat on the leaves,
staring down at her knees.

236
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:49,460
The bandit was cunning.

237
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,833
Now that her virtue was stained,

238
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,471
she could no longer be
with her husband.

239
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,938
Leave the husband
and why not marry him instead?

240
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:03,272
He said he only attacked her
out of his love for her.

241
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:09,610
When she heard that,
my wife raised her face as if in a trance.

242
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:21,890
She had never looked so beautiful.

243
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:35,339
And what was my beautiful wife's
response to the bandit

244
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,704
in front of her helpless husband?

245
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,914
Wherever.

246
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,181
Take me wherever you want.

247
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,322
That's what she said.

248
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:59,193
But that wasn't her only sin

249
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,200
or I wouldn't be suffering
in the dark like this.

250
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,016
Please kill him.

251
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,321
While he's alive,
I cannot go with you.

252
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,986
Kill him!

253
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:32,793
Those words were like a wind that

254
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:36,502
threatened to blow me
into the depths of darkness.

255
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:49,547
Has such a hateful thing
ever been uttered by a human before?

256
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:53,886
Even the bandit turned pale
at those words.

257
00:54:55,458 --> 00:55:00,054
Please kill him.

258
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,592
What do you want me
to do with her?

259
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:45,007
Kill her or save her?
You only have to nod.

260
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:55,211
For these words alone,
I was ready to pardon his crime.

261
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:03,917
Kill her or let her go?

262
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:35,387
I don't know
how many hours passed.

263
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,201
She got away. Now i'll have
to worry about my own fate.

264
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,396
Everything was silent.

265
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,829
I heard someone crying.

266
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,500
Someone is crying.

267
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,176
Who is that?

268
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,618
Everything was silent.

269
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,819
How quiet it was.

270
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,299
Suddenly the sun went away.

271
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,539
I was enveloped in deep silence.

272
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:52,312
I lay there in the stillness.

273
01:00:55,251 --> 01:01:00,245
Then someone quietly approached me.

274
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:11,833
That someone gently withdrew
the dagger from my heart.

275
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,724
It's not true!

276
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,825
There was no dagger.
He was killed by a sword.

277
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,332
Now it's getting interesting.

278
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:32,839
It seems you saw the whole thing.

279
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,950
So why didn't you tell the court?

280
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,556
I didn't want to get involved.

281
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,021
You can talk about it here, right?

282
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,426
Tell me, then.

283
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,660
Your story seems to be
the most interesting.

284
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:56,838
I don't want to hear it.
No more horror stories.

285
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,765
They are common stories
these days.

286
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:04,270
I even heard that the demon living
here in Rashomon

287
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,972
fed in fear of the ferocity of man.

288
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:14,853
Come on.
How much do you know?

289
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:23,796
I found the woman's hat
in the mountains.

290
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,930
You already said that.

291
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:33,270
About 20 yards further,
I heard a woman crying.

292
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:38,810
From behind a bush,
I saw a man tied up,

293
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:42,242
a woman crying and Tajomaru.

294
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:48,320
So you lied when you said
you found the body.

295
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,392
I didn't want to get involved.

296
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,085
All right, then.

297
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:58,190
Go on.
What was Tajomaru doing?

298
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:07,106
He was down on his knees,
begging the woman for forgiveness.

299
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,709
until now, whenever I wanted
to do something bad, I did it.

300
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,485
That way I suffered less.

301
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:21,515
But today, it's different.

302
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:27,095
I already had you, but I only
want you more. It's very hard.

303
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,429
I beg you to be my wife.

304
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:41,868
The notorious bandit Tajomaru
is begging you on his hands and knees.

305
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,647
If you wish, i'll even stop
being a bandit.

306
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:53,352
I have enough stashed away
to give you a lavish life.

307
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:58,751
And if you don't want my dirty money,
i'll even work.

308
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:05,597
I'll stoop to selling odds and ends
on the street to support you.

309
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:09,636
I'll do anything
if you come with me.

310
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,503
Marry me, please.

311
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:19,611
If you say no,
I have no choice but to kill you.

312
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,583
Please, say yes.

313
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,283
Stop crying and answer me.

314
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:32,620
Tell me you'll be my wife!

315
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:36,058
Say it!

316
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,404
It's impossible.

317
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:56,277
How could I, a woman,
say anything?

318
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:20,071
I get it. You mean
it's up to us men to decide.

319
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:24,407
Hold it!

320
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:29,945
I refuse to risk my life
for such a woman.

321
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:01,210
you've been with two men.
Why don't you kill yourself?

322
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:08,716
Hopeless.

323
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:16,155
I don't want this shameless whore.
You can have her.

324
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:22,731
At this stage, I'd rather lose her
instead of the horse.

325
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,657
- Wait!
- Don't follow me!

326
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:38,038
Stop crying.
It's not going to work anymore.

327
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:44,119
Stop it. Don't bully her.

328
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,254
Women are weak by nature.

329
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,040
It's you who are weak.

330
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:21,153
If you are my husband,

331
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:24,783
why don't you kill this man?

332
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,389
Then you can tell me to kill myself.
That's a real man.

333
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,963
You're not a real man either.

334
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:45,002
When I heard you were Tajomaru,
I stopped crying.

335
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,013
I was sick of this tiresome daily farce.

336
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:55,453
I thought, "Tajomaru might
get me out of this."

337
01:09:55,858 --> 01:10:01,387
"If he'd only save me,
I'd do anything for him."

338
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:03,397
I thought to myself.

339
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,635
But you were just as petty
as my husband.

340
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:18,403
Just remember: A woman loves a man
who loves passionately.

341
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:22,216
A man has to make a woman his
by his sword.

342
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,159
I don't want to die!

343
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:54,355
So that's the real story.

344
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:57,658
I don't tell lies.
I saw it with my own eyes.

345
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,656
I doubt it.

346
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,662
It's true. I don't lie.

347
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,839
No one lies after he says
he's going to do so.

348
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:06,871
It's horrifying.

349
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:09,773
If men don't trust each other,
this earth might as well be hell.

350
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,569
That's right. This world is hell.

351
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,442
No, I believe in men.

352
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:17,743
I don't want this place to be hell.

353
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,678
Shouting doesn't help.

354
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:25,287
Think about it. Out of these three,
whose story is believable?

355
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:29,163
No idea.

356
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:34,692
In the end, you cannot understand
the things men do.

357
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:38,826
What are you doing?

358
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,370
What's it to you?

359
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,942
- That's terrible!
- Terrible?

360
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:55,039
Someone else would have taken
the kimono. Why shouldn't I?

361
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,185
- It's evil.
- Evil?

362
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:02,351
What about this kid's parents?

363
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:08,619
They had their fun and then they
throw out the kid? They're evil.

364
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,729
No, you're wrong.

365
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:18,737
Look at the amulet on the kimono.
It was left to protect the baby.

366
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:22,472
Think about what they went through
to abandon this baby.

367
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:25,139
I don't have time to mind
everyone's feelings.

368
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:27,713
- You selfish...
- What's wrong with that?

369
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:31,084
Dogs are better off in this world.

370
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,014
If you're not selfish,
you can't survive.

371
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,393
Damn it.

372
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:50,068
Everyone is selfish and dishonest.

373
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:53,898
Making excuses.

374
01:21:55,076 --> 01:22:03,313
The bandit, the woman,
the man and you!

375
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:13,287
And you aren't? That's funny.

376
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:18,462
You may have fooled the court,
but not me.

377
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,818
So what did you do
with the dagger?

378
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:41,918
The valuable one
with the pearl inlay

379
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:44,224
that Tajomaru was talking about?

380
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:47,389
What happened to it?
Did it disappear in the grass?

381
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:51,988
If you didn't, who stole it?

382
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,666
It seems I'm right.

383
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:05,569
A bandit calling another a bandit.
Now that's selfish.

384
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:22,425
Do you have anything else to say?

385
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:25,427
If not, i'll be going.

386
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:46,407
What are you doing?
Taking what little it has left?

387
01:24:57,025 --> 01:25:00,927
I have six kids of my own.

388
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:09,829
Another one
wouldn't make a difference.

389
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:23,480
I am ashamed of what I said.

390
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:34,726
It's inevitable to be suspicious of others
on a day like this.

391
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,935
I'm the one
who should be ashamed.

392
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:47,664
I don't understand my own soul.

393
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:51,269
No, I'm grateful to you.

394
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,283
Thanks to you,

395
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:13,963
I think I can keep
my faith in man.

396
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:16,763
Don't mention it.

397
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:58,397
THE END
