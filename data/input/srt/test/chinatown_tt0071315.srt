1
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:30,914
<i>All right, Curly, enough's enough.</i>

2
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:35,473
You can't eat the Venetian blinds.
I just had them installed on Wednesday.

3
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:52,593
Down the hatch.

4
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,112
<i>- She's no good.
- What can I tell you, kid? You're right.</i>

5
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:08,791
<i>When you're right, you're right.</i>

6
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:10,510
And you're right.

7
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,470
I'll pay you the rest next week.

8
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,310
We only caught 60 tonne of skipjack
down in San Benedict.

9
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,470
And they don't pay you the same
for skipjack as they do albacore or tuna.

10
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,749
<i>Forget it, will you, Curly?</i>

11
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:24,029
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.

12
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,270
What kind of a guy do you think I am?

13
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,669
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Gittes.
- Call me Jake.</i>

14
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:31,108
<i>Careful driving home, Curl, huh?</i>

15
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:35,669
Mrs. Mulwray's waiting for you
with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

16
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:39,308
<i>Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. Gittes?</i>

17
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:43,107
<i>- Mrs. Mulwray, how do you do?
- Mr. Gittes.</i>

18
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,507
<i>Now, what seems to be the problem?</i>

19
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:48,707
<i>My husband,</i>

20
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,346
<i>I believe, is seeing another woman.</i>

21
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:56,106
- No. Really?
- I'm afraid so.

22
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,786
I am sorry.

23
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,707
<i>Mr. Gittes, please, do you think
we could discuss this alone?</i>

24
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:06,706
<i>I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray.
These are my operatives,</i>

25
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:09,946
<i>and at some point,
they're going to have to assist me.</i>

26
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:12,346
I can't do everything myself.

27
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:13,745
Of course not.

28
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,105
<i>Now,</i>

29
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,665
what makes you certain
that your husband is

30
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:24,263
involved with someone?

31
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:25,985
A wife can tell.

32
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:30,464
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,
do you love your husband?</i>

33
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:32,704
<i>Yes, of course!</i>

34
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:35,103
<i>- Then go home and forget everything.
- But, I...</i>

35
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:37,262
<i>I'm sure that he loves you, too,
Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

36
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:41,102
<i>Do you know the expression,
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?</i>

37
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:44,543
You're better off not knowing.

38
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:46,182
I have to know.

39
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,222
Very well.

40
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,902
What is your husband's first name?

41
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:57,101
Hollis.

42
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,741
Hollis Mulwray.

43
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:02,741
- Water and Power?
- He's Chief Engineer.

44
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,861
Chief Engineer?

45
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,700
<i>Mrs. Mulwray, this...</i>

46
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,060
This type of investigation can be hard
on your pocketbook.

47
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,219
It takes time...

48
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,020
<i>Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.</i>

49
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,178
<i>Okay, we'II...</i>

50
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:32,099
We'll see what we can do.

51
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,658
<i>Gentlemen, today
you can walk out that door,</i>

52
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,698
<i>turn right, hop a streetcar,
and within 25 minutes,</i>

53
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:40,217
end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

54
00:05:40,377 --> 00:05:43,898
<i>Now, you can swim in it and you can
fish in it, but you can't drink it,</i>

55
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:47,097
and you can't irrigate
an orange grove with it.

56
00:05:47,257 --> 00:05:49,657
<i>Now remember,
we live next door to the ocean,</i>

57
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:52,736
but we also live on the edge of a desert.

58
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:55,376
Los Angeles is a desert community.

59
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:58,896
<i>Beneath this building,
beneath our streets, is a desert.</i>

60
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:01,855
<i>And without water,
the dust will rise up and cover us</i>

61
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,295
as though we never existed.

62
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:06,455
<i>Now, the Alto Vallejo
can save us from this,</i>

63
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:10,295
and I respectfully suggest
that $8.5 million

64
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:14,175
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets

65
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:15,254
and not on top of them.

66
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:16,494
<i>Hear, hear!</i>

67
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:24,694
<i>Mayor Bagby, let's hear
from all the departments again.</i>

68
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:27,894
<i>I suppose we'd better take
Water and Power first.</i>

69
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,172
<i>Mr. Mulwray?</i>

70
00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:42,132
<i>In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,</i>

71
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:45,692
over 500 lives were lost
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.

72
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:50,612
Core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock

73
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:55,091
is shale similar to the permeable shale
in the Van der Lip disaster.

74
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,091
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

75
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:01,651
And now you propose
yet another dirt-banked terminus dam

76
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,810
<i>with slopes of 2.5:1 , 112 feet high,</i>

77
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,290
<i>and a 12,000-acre water surface.</i>

78
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,650
<i>Well, it won't hold.</i>

79
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,730
I won't build it. It's that simple.

80
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,528
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

81
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:17,369
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

82
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,208
Quiet! Quiet!

83
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:31,369
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get those goddamn things out of here!

84
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:33,687
- Hold some of them.
- Tell me where to take them!

85
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:37,207
<i>You don't have an answer for that
so quick, do you?</i>

86
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:40,806
<i>You steal water from the Valley,
ruin the grazing,</i>

87
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,567
starve the livestock!

88
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:45,927
<i>Who's paying you to do that,
Mr. Mulwray?</i>

89
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,607
That's what I want to know!

90
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,462
<i>- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.</i>

91
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:29,741
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

92
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,142
<i>Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,</i>

93
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:40,661
<i>a men's room at a Richfield gas station,
and The Pig'n Whistle.</i>

94
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:43,220
The guy's got water on the brain.

95
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,618
So what do you got?

96
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:18,858
This?

97
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:22,977
<i>Well, they got into a terrific argument
outside The Pig'n Whistle.</i>

98
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:25,937
What about?

99
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,377
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud.

100
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:30,256
<i>I heard only one thing, though.</i>

101
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,577
"Apple core."

102
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:34,536
- "Apple core"?
- Yeah.

103
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,497
<i>My God, Walsh, is that
what you spent your day doing?</i>

104
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:43,895
<i>Look, you tell me to take pictures,
I take pictures.</i>

105
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:46,496
<i>Let me explain
something to you, Walsh.</i>

106
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:47,935
J.J. Gittes and Associates.

107
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:51,294
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

108
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:55,374
<i>What is it, Sophie?</i>

109
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:57,294
<i>Duffy's on the phone.</i>

110
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:03,413
<i>- Yeah, Duff, where are you?
- I got it!</i>

111
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:06,094
<i>He's found himself
some cute little twist, the old buzzard...</i>

112
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:07,654
Okay. Slow down. Where are you?

113
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:09,373
<i>I'm at Glendale and Douglas.</i>

114
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,213
<i>They're in Echo Park in a rowboat.
A rowboat!</i>

115
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,573
Okay.

116
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,731
Echo Park.

117
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:18,893
Water again.

118
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:34,812
<i>Okay, pal, let's have us a big smile.</i>

119
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,610
You'll love it.

120
00:15:31,926 --> 00:15:33,805
Here. Let me...

121
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,644
<i>When you get so much publicity,
you got to get blasé about it.</i>

122
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:52,125
<i>Let's face it, Jake,
you're practically a movie star.</i>

123
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:59,723
<i>- Just look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.</i>

124
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:01,123
Sure is.

125
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:03,483
Fools' names and fools' faces.

126
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,362
<i>- What's that, pal?
- Nothing.</i>

127
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:11,963
You got a hell of a way to make a living.

128
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,202
Oh? And what do you do
to make ends meet?

129
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:18,082
<i>Mortgage department,
First National Bank.</i>

130
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:22,162
<i>Tell me, did you foreclose
on many families this week?</i>

131
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,601
<i>We don't publish a record in the paper,
I can tell you that.</i>

132
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,081
Neither do I.

133
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,601
<i>No, you have your press agent do it.</i>

134
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,802
<i>Who is this bimbo, Barney?
Is he a regular customer or what?</i>

135
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:33,560
<i>Hey, listen, pal, I make an honest living.</i>

136
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,519
People only come to me
when they're in a desperate situation.

137
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,760
I help them out.
I don't kick families out of their houses

138
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,680
<i>- like you bums down at the bank do!
- Jake, can I tell you about the guy who...</i>

139
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,519
Maybe you'd like to step down
out of the barber chair

140
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,039
and maybe we can go outside
and discuss it.

141
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,119
<i>- What do you think?
- Oh, come on.</i>

142
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,519
<i>Jake, let me tell you about the guy
who got tired...</i>

143
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,559
I don't know how that thing
got in the newspaper.

144
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,720
<i>It was so quick,
I didn't even know it myself.</i>

145
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,838
- Thank you.
- I make an honest living!

146
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,358
Of course you do.

147
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:56,639
<i>Anyway, this guy
who got tired of screwing his wife</i>

148
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,039
<i>- said to his friend, "What do I do?"
- An honest living, you understand?</i>

149
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,958
<i>So the guy says, "Why don't you do
what the Chinese do?"</i>

150
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:02,597
<i>He says, "What do the Chinese do?"</i>

151
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,758
<i>He says, "The Chinese they screw
a little and they get tired..."</i>

152
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:08,118
<i>Duffy. Hey, Walsh!</i>

153
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:11,677
<i>Sophie, go to the little girls' room
for a minute, okay?</i>

154
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,397
<i>- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...</i>

155
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:16,957
<i>Yes, Mr. Gittes.</i>

156
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:18,037
<i>- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.</i>

157
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:19,356
I want to tell you a story.

158
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:21,476
<i>So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?</i>

159
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:23,317
He's tired of screwing his wife.

160
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:24,916
<i>- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.</i>

161
00:17:24,997 --> 00:17:26,517
You're always in such a hurry.

162
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,155
<i>So his friend says to him,</i>

163
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:30,356
<i>"Hey, why don't you
do it like the Chinese do?"</i>

164
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:32,315
<i>So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"</i>

165
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:34,915
<i>The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,
first they screw a little bit,</i>

166
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:37,555
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

167
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:40,434
<i>"Come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,</i>

168
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:42,275
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.

169
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,634
<i>Walsh, just listen to me for a second.</i>

170
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:46,074
<i>I mean, you'll love this.</i>

171
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:49,234
<i>Now, then they go back
and they screw a little bit more,</i>

172
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,194
and then they go out
and they contemplate the moon

173
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:54,074
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

174
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:57,914
<i>So, now, the guy goes home and
he starts screwing his own wife, see.</i>

175
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,193
<i>So, he screws her for a little bit,
and then he stops.</i>

176
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,913
<i>He goes out of the room
and reads LIFE magazine.</i>

177
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,992
<i>Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,</i>

178
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:06,552
<i>and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey"</i>

179
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:08,272
and he goes out
and he smokes a cigarette.

180
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:10,592
<i>Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.</i>

181
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:12,592
<i>He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,</i>

182
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:14,551
<i>he gets up to start to leave again
to go look at the moon,</i>

183
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:16,432
<i>she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?</i>

184
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,192
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

185
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:22,030
Jesus!

186
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:23,791
That Barney!

187
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,231
Mr. Gittes?

188
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,110
Yes.

189
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,351
Do you know me?

190
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,551
<i>Well,</i>

191
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,269
I think I would have remembered.

192
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:43,229
Have we ever met?

193
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:46,989
<i>Well, no.</i>

194
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,308
Never?

195
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:49,589
Never.

196
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,348
That's what I thought.

197
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,428
<i>You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.</i>

198
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,789
<i>You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?</i>

199
00:18:57,188 --> 00:19:00,308
Not that Mulwray?

200
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:02,868
<i>Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.</i>

201
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:07,066
<i>And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,</i>

202
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:10,347
<i>you must also agree with me
that I never hired you to do anything,</i>

203
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:12,787
certainly not spy on my husband.

204
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,506
<i>I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.</i>

205
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,826
<i>Well, you're going to get it.</i>

206
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:20,945
<i>Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

207
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,026
I think there's been some
misunderstanding here.

208
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:24,625
There's no point
in getting tough with me. I'm just...

209
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:27,665
<i>I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes.</i>

210
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:29,305
My lawyer does.

211
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:33,424
<i>Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.</i>

212
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:39,664
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

213
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,743
<i>- Mr. Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...</i>

214
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,383
- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?

215
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,743
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

216
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:03,222
Since lunch.

217
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,741
<i>- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?</i>

218
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:10,221
Fifteen minutes ago.
Why don't I just go in and wait?

219
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:12,621
Sir?

220
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,141
Is Mr. Yelburton there?

221
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,141
Is he still in the building?

222
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:23,661
Very well. Thank you.

223
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,893
<i>Can I help you? Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.</i>

224
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,414
J.J. Gittes.

225
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:50,053
<i>It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.</i>

226
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:52,293
I wonder if you'd care
to wait in my office.

227
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,453
Certainly.

228
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,493
We're a bit nervous around here

229
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:59,371
with all this business in the papers
about Mr. Mulwray.

230
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,093
Right this way.

231
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:10,931
<i>You know, after you've worked
with a man for a certain length of time,</i>

232
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,491
<i>you come to know his habits, his values.</i>

233
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:14,611
You come to know him.

234
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:17,770
And either he's the kind
who chases after women or he isn't.

235
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,170
And Mulwray isn't?

236
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,450
He never even kids about it.

237
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,490
<i>Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.</i>

238
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,409
<i>- Sit down.
- No, thank you.</i>

239
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:31,569
Do you know
where Mulwray's having lunch?

240
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,650
<i>No, I'm sorry, I don't.</i>

241
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:36,489
<i>Well, tell him I'll be back.</i>

242
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,728
I will.

243
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,969
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?

244
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:42,849
In case I have
to get in touch with you again.

245
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:45,208
<i>- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.</i>

246
00:22:49,528 --> 00:22:51,768
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?

247
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,087
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?

248
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:57,327
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.

249
00:22:57,447 --> 00:22:59,847
You don't take a bath in it.

250
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:01,567
They wrote you a letter!

251
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:04,486
But then you'd have to be able to read.

252
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:09,686
<i>Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you.
You know Claude Mulvihill here?</i>

253
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:12,286
<i>Well, I hope so. He's working for us.</i>

254
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:13,446
Doing what?

255
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:14,966
<i>Well, frankly, there have been
some threats</i>

256
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:16,766
to blow up the city reservoirs.

257
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:19,325
<i>- Any particular reason?
- Well, it's this darn drought.</i>

258
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,965
We've had to ration water in the Valley
and the farmers are desperate.

259
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:24,445
But what can we do? The rest of the city
needs drinking water.

260
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:27,086
<i>- Well, you're in luck, Mr. Yelburton.
- How's that?</i>

261
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,644
<i>When Mulvihill here
was Sheriff of Ventura County,</i>

262
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:32,965
the rum runners landed hundreds
of tonnes of booze on the beach

263
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:35,444
and never lost a drop.

264
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:38,724
He ought to be able
to hold on to your water for you.

265
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,759
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

266
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:02,916
Please.

267
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:19,434
You wait.

268
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,509
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah. Sure.

269
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,670
Bad for the glass.

270
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:00,826
Mr. Gittes.

271
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:04,307
<i>Actually, I came to see
your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

272
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,505
Would you like something to drink?

273
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:09,746
What are you having?

274
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:12,505
<i>- Iced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.</i>

275
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:15,664
<i>- Two iced teas, Kahn, please?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

276
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,865
My husband's at the office.

277
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:22,584
<i>Actually, he's not, Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

278
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:25,104
and he's checked out of his apartment
at the El Macondo.

279
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:27,904
That's not his apartment.

280
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:30,704
<i>Anyway, I...</i>

281
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:35,262
<i>The point is, is I'm not in business
to be loved, but I am in business,</i>

282
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:37,663
<i>and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray,
whoever set your husband up,</i>

283
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:38,863
set me up.

284
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:41,101
L.A.'s a small town. People talk.

285
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:44,502
I'm just trying to make a living.
I don't want to become a local joke.

286
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,981
<i>Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.</i>

287
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:50,102
<i>- What?
- I said, I'll drop the lawsuit.</i>

288
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:52,221
So let's just drop the whole thing.

289
00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:53,981
<i>- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both.</i>

290
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:55,861
<i>- Mrs. Mulwray...
- Yes, Mr. Gittes?</i>

291
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,981
...I don't want to drop it.

292
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,140
I better talk to your husband about this.

293
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,661
Why? What on Earth for?

294
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,741
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

295
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:10,420
<i>Well, I've been accused
of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

296
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,579
but never that.

297
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,580
<i>Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,</i>

298
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,860
<i>and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.</i>

299
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,098
I'm not supposed to be the one
who's caught with his pants down.

300
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:21,578
<i>So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.</i>

301
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,539
Why should it be a problem?

302
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,698
<i>- May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.</i>

303
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,898
<i>Well, that little girlfriend,
she was pretty,</i>

304
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,178
<i>in a cheap sort of a way, of course.</i>

305
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:36,498
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

306
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:39,417
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?

307
00:28:39,897 --> 00:28:42,498
<i>- It's nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray.
- It's very personal!</i>

308
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:44,817
It couldn't be more personal.

309
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:48,376
Is this business
or an obsession with you?

310
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:50,337
Let's look at it this way.

311
00:28:50,457 --> 00:28:53,935
<i>Now, this phony broad,
excuse the language,</i>

312
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:56,376
she tells me she's you. She hires me.

313
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,576
<i>Now, whoever put her up to it
doesn't have anything against me.</i>

314
00:28:58,696 --> 00:28:59,776
They're out to get your husband.

315
00:28:59,896 --> 00:29:02,295
<i>If I can see him, I can help him.</i>

316
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:07,694
Did you talk to him this morning?

317
00:29:08,374 --> 00:29:09,375
No.

318
00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:11,734
I went riding rather early.

319
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:14,294
Looks like you went quite a distance.

320
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:16,214
I was riding bareback.

321
00:29:17,814 --> 00:29:18,894
You...

322
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:22,134
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

323
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,013
<i>Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks around them.</i>

324
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:25,533
<i>Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30.</i>

325
00:29:25,653 --> 00:29:27,253
I'll stop by.

326
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:29,052
Please call first.

327
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:46,931
<i>Sorry, closed to public, sir.</i>

328
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,811
<i>Oh, that's all right, Officer.</i>

329
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:54,131
<i>Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.</i>

330
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:57,650
<i>- Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
- That's okay.</i>

331
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:24,528
- Gittes! For Christ's sake!
- Loach.

332
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:26,768
- Get out of here before he sees you.
- What are you talking about?

333
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:29,048
- What's going on here?
- Loach!

334
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:32,048
<i>Hello, Jake.</i>

335
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:34,607
Lou. How are you?

336
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:40,207
<i>Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise, I'm okay.</i>

337
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:44,327
<i>- Yeah, summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.</i>

338
00:30:44,406 --> 00:30:45,806
<i>There's no smoking here, sir...</i>

339
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,647
<i>That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception this time.</i>

340
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:51,885
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

341
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:53,525
<i>Thanks, Lou.</i>

342
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,885
How'd you get past the guard?

343
00:30:56,685 --> 00:30:59,284
<i>Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.</i>

344
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:03,245
You look like
you've done well by yourself.

345
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:04,325
I get by.

346
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,685
<i>Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a man to find himself.</i>

347
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:08,885
Maybe you have.

348
00:31:09,044 --> 00:31:11,923
<i>Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.</i>

349
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:15,764
<i>Yeah. Tell me,
you still putting Chinamen in jail</i>

350
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:18,003
for spitting in the laundry?

351
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:20,883
<i>You're a little behind the times, Jake.</i>

352
00:31:21,044 --> 00:31:22,963
They use steam irons now.

353
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:25,163
And I'm out of Chinatown.

354
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,203
Since when?

355
00:31:27,643 --> 00:31:29,642
Since I made lieutenant.

356
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:31,882
Congratulations.

357
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:36,641
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

358
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,841
Who?

359
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:40,562
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

360
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:42,282
Yeah.

361
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:44,801
I'd like to talk to him.

362
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,562
<i>So you'd like to talk to him, huh?</i>

363
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,880
You're welcome to try.

364
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,600
There he is.

365
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:14,439
Looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run-off channel.

366
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:17,678
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

367
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:22,318
<i>Obviously, the fall
must have knocked him unconscious.</i>

368
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:25,517
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

369
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,676
this alleged affair
your husband was having.

370
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:33,037
The publicity didn't make him

371
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,877
<i>morose, or unhappy?</i>

372
00:32:37,236 --> 00:32:39,236
It didn't make him happy.

373
00:32:39,315 --> 00:32:42,036
There is no possibility
that he would have taken his own life?

374
00:32:42,156 --> 00:32:43,236
No.

375
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:46,757
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

376
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:50,715
do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

377
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:53,036
No.

378
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,395
- Or where she might be?
- Certainly not.

379
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,234
You and your husband
never discussed her?

380
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:01,035
He...

381
00:33:01,995 --> 00:33:03,154
We did.

382
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:05,954
He wouldn't tell me her name.

383
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:10,514
<i>We quarrelled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.</i>

384
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:12,514
A complete surprise?

385
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:15,033
I thought you hired
a private investigator.

386
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,153
A private investigator?

387
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:20,433
Mr. Gittes.

388
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:29,352
<i>Yes, but I did that
because I thought I would put an end</i>

389
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:32,152
to a ridiculous rumor that had no basis.

390
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:36,671
When did Mr. Gittes inform you

391
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:39,231
that these rumors
had some foundation in fact?

392
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,390
<i>Just before the story
broke in the papers, Lou.</i>

393
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,711
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find her?

394
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:46,871
No.

395
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:49,550
- Or her name?
- No.

396
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:51,549
Of course not.

397
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,750
<i>Will you need me
for anything else, Lieutenant?</i>

398
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,949
<i>Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.</i>

399
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,351
<i>If we need any more information,
we'll be in touch.</i>

400
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:02,629
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

401
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,669
<i>I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.</i>

402
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:12,509
<i>- Jake, come on, what's the story?
- Take it easy, guys. Let us get through.</i>

403
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:13,908
We better do this in a hurry.

404
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:17,188
<i>Let us through, guys!
Give us a little room!</i>

405
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:20,907
<i>You want a picture, guys? Here it is!</i>

406
00:34:21,028 --> 00:34:22,907
<i>"Gittes", two T's and an E.</i>

407
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,307
Thank you for
going along with me back there.

408
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:30,466
I just didn't want to explain anything.

409
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:32,707
I'll send you a check.

410
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:33,827
A check?

411
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,705
To make it official that I've hired you.

412
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:54,664
I'll get to him this afternoon if I can.

413
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:56,983
<i>Jake, what are you doing here?</i>

414
00:34:57,103 --> 00:34:58,545
<i>Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour.</i>

415
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:01,264
Thought I'd drop by
and see who dropped dead lately.

416
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:03,103
Yeah? Isn't this something?

417
00:35:03,703 --> 00:35:06,144
<i>Middle of a drought,
and the Water Commissioner drowns.</i>

418
00:35:06,264 --> 00:35:08,663
- Only in L.A.
- Yeah.

419
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:12,062
<i>- Looks pretty banged up.
- Well, it's a long fall.</i>

420
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:19,303
<i>So how are you doing, Morty?</i>

421
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:23,022
<i>Never better, except for this darn cough.</i>

422
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:25,262
<i>- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.</i>

423
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,661
Who you got there?

424
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:37,622
<i>Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk.</i>

425
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:40,900
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

426
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,060
Quite a character.

427
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:47,940
Lately he'd been living
in one of the downtown storm drains.

428
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:52,420
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

429
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,499
<i>All right, there.</i>

430
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,738
<i>Yeah. He drowned, too.</i>

431
00:36:03,898 --> 00:36:05,059
Come again?

432
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:08,618
<i>Yeah. Got drunk, passed out
in the bottom of the riverbed.</i>

433
00:36:08,737 --> 00:36:10,178
The L.A. River?

434
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,778
<i>Yeah, right under Hollenbeck Bridge.
What's wrong with that?</i>

435
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:16,017
<i>Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.</i>

436
00:36:16,097 --> 00:36:18,337
It's not completely dry.

437
00:36:18,457 --> 00:36:21,137
<i>Well, he ain't gonna exactly
drown in a damp riverbed,</i>

438
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:23,177
no matter how soused he is.

439
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:25,817
We got water out of him. He drowned!

440
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:22,771
Hello.

441
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:31,131
Howdy.

442
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:34,771
<i>You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?</i>

443
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:37,971
Do you speak English?

444
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:46,249
You were talking to a man
a few days ago. He wore glasses...

445
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:47,689
Yes.

446
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,250
<i>What did you talk about,
do you mind my asking?</i>

447
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,929
- The water.
- What about the water?

448
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:56,249
- When it comes.
- When it comes?

449
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:58,769
What did you tell him?

450
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:01,328
It comes in different parts of the river.

451
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,608
Every night a different part.

452
00:40:19,076 --> 00:40:22,876
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn Florsheim shoe.

453
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:33,674
<i>Hold it there, kitty-cat! Hold it!</i>

454
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:42,395
<i>Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?</i>

455
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:49,954
<i>You're a very nosy fellow, kitty-cat, huh?</i>

456
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,754
You know what happens
to nosy fellows?

457
00:40:51,874 --> 00:40:55,593
No? Want to guess? No?

458
00:40:55,713 --> 00:40:57,793
Okay. They lose their noses.

459
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,992
Next time you lose the whole thing.

460
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:07,752
Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.

461
00:41:09,112 --> 00:41:10,153
Understand?

462
00:41:11,032 --> 00:41:12,511
<i>- Understand?
- Don't you understand, Gittes?</i>

463
00:41:12,631 --> 00:41:14,232
I understand.

464
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:15,671
All right.

465
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,231
<i>So some contractor
wants to build a dam,</i>

466
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,711
and he makes a few payoffs. So what?

467
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:34,190
Think you can nail Mulvihill?
They'll claim you were trespassing.

468
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,829
Don't want Mulvihill.

469
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:38,670
I want the big boys
that are making the payoffs.

470
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,068
Then what do you do?

471
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:41,749
Sue the shit out of them.

472
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,269
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

473
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:48,629
<i>- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.</i>

474
00:41:49,108 --> 00:41:51,188
<i>- Who?
- Ida Sessions.</i>

475
00:41:52,868 --> 00:41:55,109
Don't know her. Take a number.

476
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:56,828
<i>Sue people like that,</i>

477
00:41:56,948 --> 00:42:01,067
they're liable to be having dinner
with the judge who's trying the suit.

478
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:04,467
<i>I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.</i>

479
00:42:04,587 --> 00:42:06,427
<i>She says you know her.</i>

480
00:42:07,147 --> 00:42:08,227
Okay.

481
00:42:12,386 --> 00:42:15,586
<i>Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.</i>

482
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:17,505
<i>Oh, yes, we have.</i>

483
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:19,866
<i>- Are you alone?
- Isn't everyone?</i>

484
00:42:20,826 --> 00:42:22,666
What can I do for you?

485
00:42:23,906 --> 00:42:26,064
<i>Well, I'm a working girl.</i>

486
00:42:26,184 --> 00:42:28,385
<i>I didn't come in to see you on my own.</i>

487
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,185
When did you come in?

488
00:42:30,305 --> 00:42:33,705
<i>I was the one who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray. Remember?</i>

489
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:36,304
<i>- Shut the fuck up.
- Beg your pardon?</i>

490
00:42:36,744 --> 00:42:39,744
<i>- Yes, I remember.
- Beg your pardon? Is something wrong?</i>

491
00:42:39,864 --> 00:42:43,863
No. I was just checking a detail
or two with my two associates.

492
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:45,023
Go on.

493
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:48,464
<i>I never expected anything to happen
like what happened to Mr. Mulwray.</i>

494
00:42:48,584 --> 00:42:50,983
<i>The point is, if it ever comes out,</i>

495
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:53,943
<i>I want somebody to know
that I didn't know what would happen.</i>

496
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:55,463
I understand.

497
00:42:56,462 --> 00:42:59,022
Who was your employer?
That could be helpful to both of us.

498
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:00,583
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no.</i>

499
00:43:01,142 --> 00:43:02,221
<i>No.</i>

500
00:43:03,662 --> 00:43:05,861
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.

501
00:43:05,982 --> 00:43:06,982
<i>No, Mr. Gittes.</i>

502
00:43:07,102 --> 00:43:10,022
<i>Just look in the obituary column
of today's L.A. Post-Record.</i>

503
00:43:10,142 --> 00:43:11,621
The obituary column?

504
00:43:11,741 --> 00:43:15,341
<i>- You'll find one of those people.
- "Those people"? Miss...</i>

505
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:18,381
Sure.

506
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:21,060
How do you like them apples?

507
00:43:50,738 --> 00:43:52,698
Ma'am.

508
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:58,737
Thank you for coming.

509
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:07,856
<i>- Yes, sir?
- Drink?</i>

510
00:44:08,577 --> 00:44:10,936
<i>Tom Collins.
With lime, not lemon, please.</i>

511
00:44:11,055 --> 00:44:12,937
Tom Collins with lime.

512
00:44:16,095 --> 00:44:18,495
I got your check in the mail.

513
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,696
<i>Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.</i>

514
00:44:22,734 --> 00:44:25,855
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,
I'm afraid that's not good enough.</i>

515
00:44:29,574 --> 00:44:31,174
How much would you like?

516
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,214
<i>Oh, stop it, the money's fine.
It's generous.</i>

517
00:44:34,414 --> 00:44:39,094
But I think you short-changed me
on the story.

518
00:44:39,934 --> 00:44:42,052
- I have?
- I think so.

519
00:44:42,173 --> 00:44:45,213
Something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

520
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:47,613
<i>You were upset, but not that upset.</i>

521
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:50,612
<i>Mr. Gittes, don't tell me how I feel.</i>

522
00:44:54,132 --> 00:44:55,292
Sorry.

523
00:44:56,852 --> 00:45:01,092
<i>Look, you sue me, your husband dies,
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato,</i>

524
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:04,411
all of it quicker
than the wind from a duck's ass.

525
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:06,132
Excuse me.

526
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:11,371
- Then you ask me to lie to the police...
- It wasn't much of a lie.

527
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:13,851
<i>If your husband was killed, it was.</i>

528
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:17,369
This could look like you paid me off
to withhold evidence.

529
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:19,290
But he wasn't killed.

530
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:24,610
<i>Mrs. Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.</i>

531
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:30,768
<i>Well,</i>

532
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,010
I suppose I am.

533
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:37,689
<i>Actually, I knew about the affair.</i>

534
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:41,488
- How did you find out?
- My husband.

535
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:42,968
He told you?

536
00:45:43,567 --> 00:45:46,008
And you weren't the least bit upset?

537
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,848
I was grateful.

538
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:51,888
<i>Mrs. Mulwray, you'll have to explain that.</i>

539
00:45:51,968 --> 00:45:53,047
Why?

540
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:56,046
<i>Look, I do matrimonial work.
It's my métier.</i>

541
00:45:56,126 --> 00:45:58,967
<i>When a wife tells me that she's happy
that her husband is cheating on her,</i>

542
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,486
it runs contrary to my experience.

543
00:46:02,086 --> 00:46:03,486
Unless what?

544
00:46:06,086 --> 00:46:08,006
She was cheating on him.

545
00:46:10,565 --> 00:46:11,885
Were you?

546
00:46:16,805 --> 00:46:18,925
I dislike the word "cheat".

547
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:21,524
Did you have affairs?

548
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:24,205
- Mr. Gittes...
- Did he know about it?

549
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:28,364
<i>Well, I wouldn't run home and tell him
every time I went to bed with someone,</i>

550
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:30,444
if that's what you mean.

551
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:33,043
Is there anything else you want
to know about me?

552
00:46:33,443 --> 00:46:36,043
Where were you
when your husband died?

553
00:46:36,643 --> 00:46:38,003
I can't tell you.

554
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:39,602
You mean you don't know
where you were?

555
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:42,922
<i>- I mean I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone, too.</i>

556
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:46,283
For very long?

557
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:49,322
<i>I don't see anyone
for very long, Mr. Gittes.</i>

558
00:46:49,842 --> 00:46:51,722
It's difficult for me.

559
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:58,322
<i>Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.</i>

560
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:00,842
I didn't want publicity.

561
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:04,122
<i>I didn't want to go
into any of this, then or now.</i>

562
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:06,120
Is that all?

563
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,561
<i>By the way,
what does this "C" stand for?</i>

564
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:16,840
"Cross."

565
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,520
- It's your maiden name?
- Yes.

566
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:23,078
Why?

567
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,159
No reason.

568
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:27,439
You must've had a reason
to ask me that.

569
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:29,359
No. I'm just a snoop.

570
00:47:35,038 --> 00:47:38,198
No. I have my own car. The Packard.

571
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:40,118
<i>Wait a minute, sonny.</i>

572
00:47:40,278 --> 00:47:42,317
I think you better come with me.

573
00:47:42,397 --> 00:47:44,558
But why? There's nothing more to say.

574
00:47:44,637 --> 00:47:46,797
<i>Will you get my car, please?</i>

575
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:50,677
<i>Okay, go home.</i>

576
00:47:50,837 --> 00:47:54,437
<i>But in case you're interested,
your husband was murdered.</i>

577
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:56,717
Somebody's been dumping
thousands of tonnes of water

578
00:47:56,797 --> 00:47:57,877
<i>from the city's reservoirs,</i>

579
00:47:58,037 --> 00:48:00,235
and we're supposed to be
in the middle of a drought.

580
00:48:00,395 --> 00:48:02,957
<i>He found out about it, and he was killed.</i>

581
00:48:03,036 --> 00:48:04,836
There's a waterlogged drunk
in the morgue.

582
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,316
<i>Involuntary manslaughter,
if anybody wants to take the trouble,</i>

583
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:08,395
which they don't.

584
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:10,636
<i>It seems like half the city
is trying to cover it all up,</i>

585
00:48:10,795 --> 00:48:12,555
which is fine by me.

586
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:15,275
<i>But, Mrs. Mulwray,</i>

587
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:17,554
<i>I goddamn near lost my nose,</i>

588
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:18,914
and I like it.

589
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:20,834
I like breathing through it.

590
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:23,955
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

591
00:48:32,314 --> 00:48:34,033
Mr. Gittes...

592
00:48:43,313 --> 00:48:46,112
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

593
00:49:15,149 --> 00:49:17,869
Mr. Yelburton will be busy
for some time.

594
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,508
<i>Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.</i>

595
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:24,588
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

596
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:27,228
I take a long lunch hour.

597
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:31,108
<i>All day, sometimes.</i>

598
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:30,983
Noah Cross worked
for the Water Department.

599
00:50:31,103 --> 00:50:32,342
Yes.

600
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,623
<i>- No.
- Well, did he or didn't he?</i>

601
00:50:34,703 --> 00:50:36,622
He owned it.

602
00:50:37,862 --> 00:50:40,222
He owned the Water Department?

603
00:50:40,342 --> 00:50:41,422
Yes.

604
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:46,541
<i>You mean, he owned
the entire water supply for the city?</i>

605
00:50:46,661 --> 00:50:47,742
Yes.

606
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,221
How did they get it away from him?

607
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:58,621
Mr. Mulwray felt
the public should own the water.

608
00:50:58,741 --> 00:51:00,420
Mr. Mulwray?

609
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,020
I thought you said Cross owned it.

610
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,979
Along with Mr. Mulwray.

611
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:09,819
<i>- They were partners?
- Yes! Yes, they were partners.</i>

612
00:51:46,056 --> 00:51:48,577
Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

613
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:56,055
<i>Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

614
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:59,215
<i>These staff meetings,
they just go on and on.</i>

615
00:51:59,335 --> 00:52:03,375
Yeah. Must be especially tough
to take over under these circumstances.

616
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:07,335
Yes. Hollis was the best
department chief the city's ever had.

617
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:10,255
<i>My goodness,
what happened to your nose?</i>

618
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:12,093
Cut myself shaving.

619
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:16,094
<i>Well, you ought to be more careful.
That must really smart.</i>

620
00:52:16,214 --> 00:52:17,973
Only when I breathe.

621
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:23,893
Only when you breathe.

622
00:52:24,573 --> 00:52:27,413
Don't tell me you're still working
for Mrs. Mulwray.

623
00:52:27,534 --> 00:52:29,772
- I never was.
- I don't understand.

624
00:52:30,812 --> 00:52:32,612
<i>Neither do I, actually.</i>

625
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,172
You hired me.

626
00:52:35,092 --> 00:52:37,412
Or you hired that chippy to hire me.

627
00:52:38,012 --> 00:52:40,972
<i>Mr. Gittes, you're not making
a bit of sense.</i>

628
00:52:42,011 --> 00:52:44,132
<i>Well, let's look at it this way.</i>

629
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:46,331
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.

630
00:52:46,452 --> 00:52:48,570
He had a reputation
that was hard to get around.

631
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,411
You decided to ruin it.

632
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:53,731
Then he found out
you were dumping water at night.

633
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:55,891
Then he was...

634
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,489
Drowned.

635
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:01,090
<i>Mr. Gittes,
that's an outrageous accusation.</i>

636
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,410
I don't know what you're talking about.

637
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,170
<i>Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.</i>

638
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:09,729
Dumping thousands of gallons of water
down the toilet

639
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:12,568
<i>in the middle of a drought, that's news.</i>

640
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:15,888
<i>Mr. Gittes,</i>

641
00:53:16,848 --> 00:53:18,128
we're...

642
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:22,529
<i>We're not anxious for this to get around,
but we have been diverting a little water</i>

643
00:53:22,649 --> 00:53:25,487
to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

644
00:53:25,607 --> 00:53:28,167
<i>As you know, the farmers out there
have no legal right to our water,</i>

645
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,807
<i>but we've been trying to help
some of them out,</i>

646
00:53:29,928 --> 00:53:31,767
keep them from going under.

647
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:35,446
<i>Naturally, when you divert water,
there's a little run-off.</i>

648
00:53:35,566 --> 00:53:37,566
Yeah. A little run-off.

649
00:53:38,366 --> 00:53:41,885
- Where'd you say those groves were?
- In the Northwest Valley.

650
00:53:42,006 --> 00:53:44,685
That's like saying they're in Arizona.

651
00:53:45,045 --> 00:53:49,366
<i>Mr. Gittes, my field men are out.
I can't give you the exact location.</i>

652
00:53:49,845 --> 00:53:52,406
<i>- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yes.</i>

653
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:55,405
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?

654
00:53:56,165 --> 00:53:57,325
Yes.

655
00:53:57,445 --> 00:53:59,445
I don't want to nail you.

656
00:54:04,164 --> 00:54:06,805
I want to find out who put you up to it.

657
00:54:06,965 --> 00:54:09,083
I'll give you a few days to think about it.

658
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:10,963
Call me. I can help.

659
00:54:11,643 --> 00:54:12,684
Who knows?

660
00:54:12,804 --> 00:54:16,203
<i>Maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big-shots,</i>

661
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:17,843
and you can stay
the head of the department

662
00:54:18,002 --> 00:54:19,763
for the next 20 years.

663
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,040
<i>- Drink?
- No, thank you.</i>

664
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:09,199
What is your usual salary?

665
00:55:10,078 --> 00:55:13,878
<i>$35 a day, plus 20 to my associates,</i>

666
00:55:14,558 --> 00:55:16,038
<i>plus expenses,</i>

667
00:55:16,957 --> 00:55:19,278
plus a bonus if I show results.

668
00:55:22,477 --> 00:55:26,037
<i>Whoever is behind my husband's death,
why have they gone to all this trouble?</i>

669
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:27,318
Money.

670
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,596
<i>How they plan to make it
out of emptying reservoirs,</i>

671
00:55:30,716 --> 00:55:32,397
that I don't know.

672
00:55:32,757 --> 00:55:34,476
<i>I'll pay your salary,</i>

673
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:36,117
<i>plus $5,000</i>

674
00:55:36,596 --> 00:55:40,395
<i>if you find out what happened to Hollis,
and who is involved.</i>

675
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:48,555
<i>Sophie, draw up one of our
standard contracts for Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

676
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:50,314
<i>Yes, Mr. Gittes.</i>

677
00:55:53,995 --> 00:55:55,914
Tell me something.

678
00:55:56,075 --> 00:55:58,914
Did you get married before or after
Mulwray and your father

679
00:55:58,995 --> 00:56:01,034
sold the Water Department?

680
00:56:01,434 --> 00:56:03,954
<i>Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?</i>

681
00:56:06,554 --> 00:56:08,074
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

682
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:10,513
It was sometime after.

683
00:56:11,474 --> 00:56:14,634
I was just out of grade school
when they did that.

684
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:19,393
Then you married
your father's business partner.

685
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:24,912
<i>You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

686
00:56:26,552 --> 00:56:30,351
Does my talking about your father
upset you?

687
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:31,712
<i>Why, no.</i>

688
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:34,430
Yes. A little.

689
00:56:34,511 --> 00:56:36,551
<i>You see, Hollis and my...</i>

690
00:56:38,031 --> 00:56:39,072
My father

691
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:41,671
had a falling-out finally.

692
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,870
Over you
or over the Water Department?

693
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,070
Not over me. Why should it be over me?

694
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,710
Then it was over
the Water Department.

695
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:50,791
Yes.

696
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:54,349
<i>Hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public,</i>

697
00:56:54,469 --> 00:56:58,029
and I don't think my father felt that way.

698
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,188
<i>Actually, it was over
the Van der Lip Dam.</i>

699
00:57:01,348 --> 00:57:02,588
<i>You know, the dam that broke?</i>

700
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:05,869
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it.</i>

701
00:57:06,029 --> 00:57:10,027
- Never forgave him for what?
- For talking him into building it.

702
00:57:10,188 --> 00:57:12,668
They never spoke from that time on.

703
00:57:16,547 --> 00:57:18,308
You sure about that?

704
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:20,906
Of course I'm sure.

705
00:57:25,547 --> 00:57:26,827
Sign here.

706
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:29,986
The copy's for you.

707
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:31,861
- Mr. Gitts?
- Gittes.

708
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:34,340
How do you do?

709
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,501
<i>You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gitts.
I like that.</i>

710
00:58:39,341 --> 00:58:40,380
Thanks.

711
00:58:40,459 --> 00:58:42,299
<i>If you were a bank president,
that would be one thing,</i>

712
00:58:42,379 --> 00:58:44,420
<i>but in your business, it's admirable.</i>

713
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,380
And it's good advertising.

714
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:47,459
It doesn't hurt.

715
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:50,779
It's why you attracted
a client like my daughter.

716
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:52,579
Probably.

717
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:54,499
<i>But I'm surprised
you're still working for her,</i>

718
00:58:54,619 --> 00:58:56,979
unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

719
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:00,978
No. She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

720
00:59:02,899 --> 00:59:04,859
How'd she get that idea?

721
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:07,417
I think I gave it to her.

722
00:59:08,537 --> 00:59:12,258
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

723
00:59:12,378 --> 00:59:15,498
Fine. Long as you don't serve
chicken that way.

724
00:59:17,496 --> 00:59:20,576
<i>Tell me, what do the police say?</i>

725
00:59:20,696 --> 00:59:22,937
They're calling it an accident.

726
00:59:24,017 --> 00:59:27,856
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant.

727
00:59:27,975 --> 00:59:30,416
<i>- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

728
00:59:30,936 --> 00:59:32,295
Where from?

729
00:59:33,056 --> 00:59:35,696
We used to work together.
In Chinatown.

730
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,935
Would you call him a capable man?

731
00:59:40,735 --> 00:59:41,856
Very.

732
00:59:42,335 --> 00:59:43,535
Honest?

733
00:59:43,895 --> 00:59:45,254
As far as it goes.

734
00:59:46,094 --> 00:59:49,054
<i>Of course, he has to swim
in the same water we all do.</i>

735
00:59:49,174 --> 00:59:52,613
<i>Of course, but you've no reason to think
he's bungled the case?</i>

736
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:54,933
- None.
- That's too bad.

737
00:59:55,854 --> 00:59:57,133
Too bad?

738
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:01,332
It disturbs me. Makes me think
you're taking my daughter for a ride.

739
01:00:01,452 --> 01:00:03,773
<i>Financially speaking, of course.</i>

740
01:00:04,693 --> 01:00:06,693
What are you charging her?

741
01:00:08,413 --> 01:00:12,252
<i>My usual fee,
plus a bonus if I get results.</i>

742
01:00:12,372 --> 01:00:14,372
Are you sleeping with her?

743
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:17,812
<i>Come, come, Mr. Gitts.</i>

744
01:00:17,932 --> 01:00:21,452
<i>You don't have to think about that
to remember, do you?</i>

745
01:00:23,132 --> 01:00:25,171
<i>If you want an answer
to that question, Mr. Cross,</i>

746
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,771
I'll put one of my men on the job.

747
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:31,010
- Good afternoon.
- Mr. Gitts...

748
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:32,730
- Gittes.
- Gittes.

749
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:36,571
You're dealing with a disturbed woman
who just lost her husband.

750
01:00:36,691 --> 01:00:39,009
I don't want her taken advantage of.

751
01:00:39,129 --> 01:00:40,889
- Sit down.
- What for?

752
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:46,729
<i>You may think you know
what you're dealing with,</i>

753
01:00:46,848 --> 01:00:48,889
<i>but believe me, you don't.</i>

754
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:51,489
Why is that funny?

755
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:54,609
It's what the District Attorney
used to tell me in Chinatown.

756
01:00:54,729 --> 01:00:56,448
Yeah? Was he right?

757
01:00:57,768 --> 01:01:00,608
Exactly what do you know about me?
Sit down.

758
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:07,767
<i>Mainly that you're rich,</i>

759
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:11,327
and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

760
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:13,966
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.

761
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:17,287
<i>Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores</i>

762
01:01:17,406 --> 01:01:20,367
all get respectable
if they last long enough.

763
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:24,046
<i>I'll double whatever your fee is
and pay you $10,000</i>

764
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:26,445
if you find Hollis' girlfriend.

765
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:29,565
<i>- Girlfriend?
- Disappeared, hasn't she?</i>

766
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,805
Yeah.

767
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:33,926
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

768
01:01:34,046 --> 01:01:35,245
Maybe.

769
01:01:36,925 --> 01:01:37,885
<i>If Mulwray was murdered,</i>

770
01:01:38,005 --> 01:01:41,084
she'd be one of the last
to have seen him alive.

771
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,964
When's the last time you saw Mulwray?

772
01:01:45,324 --> 01:01:47,564
Sheriff's gold posse.
Bunch of damn fools

773
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:51,443
<i>who pay $5,000 apiece
towards the Sheriff's re-election.</i>

774
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:54,324
I let them practice up out here.

775
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:56,564
Yeah.

776
01:01:58,203 --> 01:02:01,003
Do you remember the last time
you saw Mulwray?

777
01:02:01,123 --> 01:02:03,523
<i>At my age, you tend to forget.</i>

778
01:02:04,923 --> 01:02:07,482
<i>It was five days ago outside
The Pig'n Whistle,</i>

779
01:02:07,602 --> 01:02:10,202
and you had one hell of an argument.

780
01:02:10,321 --> 01:02:14,123
<i>I got the pictures in my office,
if that'll help you remember.</i>

781
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:19,960
- What was the argument about?
- My daughter.

782
01:02:21,761 --> 01:02:23,281
What about her?

783
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:27,480
<i>Just find the girl, Mr. Gitts.</i>

784
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,280
I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.

785
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,160
I'd like to help her if I can.

786
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,000
I had no idea you and Hollis
were that fond of one another.

787
01:02:41,879 --> 01:02:44,078
<i>Hollis Mulwray made this city,</i>

788
01:02:44,758 --> 01:02:46,759
and he made me a fortune.

789
01:02:48,438 --> 01:02:51,438
We were a lot closer
than Evelyn realized.

790
01:02:54,158 --> 01:02:58,597
<i>If you want to hire me, I still have to
know what the argument was about.</i>

791
01:02:59,759 --> 01:03:01,957
My daughter's a very jealous woman.

792
01:03:02,037 --> 01:03:04,997
I didn't want her to find out
about the girl.

793
01:03:05,237 --> 01:03:06,957
How did you find out?

794
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:11,156
<i>I still got a few teeth left in my head,
and a few friends in town.</i>

795
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:15,076
Okay.

796
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:17,996
I'II...

797
01:03:19,355 --> 01:03:22,156
I'll have my secretary
draw up the papers.

798
01:03:22,836 --> 01:03:24,076
<i>Tell me,</i>

799
01:03:25,195 --> 01:03:29,034
are you frightened for the girl
or what Evelyn might do to her?

800
01:03:29,194 --> 01:03:30,915
Just find the girl.

801
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:33,995
<i>I'll look into it,</i>

802
01:03:34,155 --> 01:03:37,154
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

803
01:03:38,073 --> 01:03:39,555
Orange groves?

804
01:03:40,554 --> 01:03:42,754
<i>We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.</i>

805
01:03:47,794 --> 01:03:49,673
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could you tell me

806
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:52,394
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

807
01:03:52,554 --> 01:03:54,273
Part of it's in Ventura County.

808
01:03:54,354 --> 01:03:57,672
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

809
01:03:58,152 --> 01:04:01,193
<i>Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.</i>

810
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:03,632
<i>Row 23, section C.</i>

811
01:04:07,952 --> 01:04:09,152
Weasel.

812
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:03,706
<i>Say, sonny,</i>

813
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:09,346
why do they have all those names
pasted in the plat books?

814
01:05:09,425 --> 01:05:12,746
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded within the week.

815
01:05:12,906 --> 01:05:15,906
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

816
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:20,385
<i>Well, that means that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.</i>

817
01:05:20,465 --> 01:05:22,385
If that's what it says.

818
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:26,505
Can I check one of these volumes out?

819
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:31,264
<i>Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.</i>

820
01:05:31,425 --> 01:05:34,225
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

821
01:05:35,184 --> 01:05:38,304
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

822
01:05:38,384 --> 01:05:40,904
I'd like to be able to read across.

823
01:05:52,303 --> 01:05:53,862
<i>Why, thank you.</i>

824
01:06:58,297 --> 01:06:59,976
Hold it right there!

825
01:08:05,731 --> 01:08:07,931
<i>All right, quit it. Quit, now!</i>

826
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,451
Search the man. See if he's armed.

827
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:26,050
<i>I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!</i>

828
01:08:26,449 --> 01:08:28,328
Search him. Search him!

829
01:08:29,489 --> 01:08:31,169
He ain't armed.

830
01:08:31,289 --> 01:08:32,688
<i>All right, mister, who you with,</i>

831
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:35,808
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

832
01:08:36,608 --> 01:08:38,048
- Get away from me!
- Answer him!

833
01:08:38,168 --> 01:08:39,488
<i>You come near me
with that thing again,</i>

834
01:08:39,608 --> 01:08:40,608
you're gonna need a pair of them!

835
01:08:40,728 --> 01:08:42,447
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

836
01:08:42,568 --> 01:08:46,287
I said cut that out! Give the man
a chance to say something!

837
01:08:49,847 --> 01:08:53,367
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.

838
01:08:53,486 --> 01:08:55,086
I'm not with either one of them.

839
01:08:56,247 --> 01:08:58,526
<i>Then what you doing out here, mister?</i>

840
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:00,766
A client hired me to see...

841
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:04,446
To see if the Water Department
was irrigating your land.

842
01:09:04,566 --> 01:09:06,165
Irrigating my land?

843
01:09:06,285 --> 01:09:07,805
The Water Department's been sending
you people out here

844
01:09:07,925 --> 01:09:10,525
<i>to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down three of my wells.</i>

845
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,645
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

846
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:15,364
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

847
01:09:20,284 --> 01:09:21,643
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

848
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,564
Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us.

849
01:09:24,684 --> 01:09:29,044
<i>Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.</i>

850
01:09:36,164 --> 01:09:37,524
<i>Well, that's that.</i>

851
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:05,720
What's going on?

852
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,719
<i>You didn't look too good,</i>

853
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,680
so we thought we better call
your employer.

854
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,720
Thanks for coming.

855
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:23,678
- That dam's a con job.
- What dam?

856
01:10:23,798 --> 01:10:27,358
The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L.A. into building it.

857
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:30,078
<i>But the water's not gonna go to L. A.,
it's coming right here.</i>

858
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:31,318
To the Valley?

859
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:33,797
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.

860
01:10:33,877 --> 01:10:36,278
I was at the Hall of Records today.

861
01:10:42,237 --> 01:10:45,837
<i>In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,</i>

862
01:10:45,957 --> 01:10:49,477
<i>Emma Dill, 12,000,
Clarence Speer, 5,000,</i>

863
01:10:49,597 --> 01:10:52,636
<i>and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.</i>

864
01:10:52,756 --> 01:10:54,636
- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?

865
01:10:54,757 --> 01:10:58,317
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.

866
01:10:58,436 --> 01:11:00,195
They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

867
01:11:00,275 --> 01:11:01,635
and then picking it up for peanuts.

868
01:11:01,755 --> 01:11:06,115
You have any idea what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

869
01:11:06,235 --> 01:11:09,075
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

870
01:11:10,795 --> 01:11:14,034
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

871
01:11:15,955 --> 01:11:17,673
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

872
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,353
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

873
01:11:22,794 --> 01:11:24,434
- We got it!
- What?

874
01:11:24,553 --> 01:11:26,033
- We got it.
- What? What is it?

875
01:11:26,154 --> 01:11:29,034
"A memorial service was held
at the Mar Vista Inn today

876
01:11:29,193 --> 01:11:30,193
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

877
01:11:30,313 --> 01:11:32,593
He passed away two weeks ago.

878
01:11:33,553 --> 01:11:35,153
Why is that unusual?

879
01:11:35,594 --> 01:11:39,152
<i>He passed away two weeks ago,
and one week ago he bought the land.</i>

880
01:11:39,272 --> 01:11:40,833
That's unusual.

881
01:12:22,828 --> 01:12:26,028
<i>Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?</i>

882
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,229
<i>Yes, I hope so.</i>

883
01:12:29,548 --> 01:12:30,787
It's Dad.

884
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:32,827
I can't seem to handle him anymore.

885
01:12:32,947 --> 01:12:35,148
<i>- Can I, sweetheart?
- My goodness.</i>

886
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,667
Nothing with Dad. It's me.

887
01:12:37,827 --> 01:12:40,227
<i>Oh, no, no, Dad is an absolute angel
with everyone else.</i>

888
01:12:40,387 --> 01:12:43,266
<i>- It's just that he and my...
- Oh, I don't know.</i>

889
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:46,146
<i>Of course, I'm anxious
for him to have the best,</i>

890
01:12:46,227 --> 01:12:47,907
and money is no object.

891
01:12:48,066 --> 01:12:50,626
Perhaps if we met with your father.

892
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:53,826
- There is one question.
- Of course.

893
01:12:53,986 --> 01:12:56,985
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

894
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,464
<i>I'm sorry, but we don't.</i>

895
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:01,186
Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.

896
01:13:01,265 --> 01:13:04,065
<i>We just wanted to be sure,
didn't we, hon?</i>

897
01:13:04,225 --> 01:13:08,344
<i>Would it be possible for me to see
a list of your patients, just to be certain?</i>

898
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:12,384
We never reveal the names
of our guests as a matter of policy.

899
01:13:12,463 --> 01:13:14,465
You would appreciate that
if your father came to live with us.

900
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:17,664
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear you say.

901
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,823
Good.

902
01:13:18,983 --> 01:13:21,184
<i>I wonder, is it too late
for us to have a look around?</i>

903
01:13:21,344 --> 01:13:22,503
No. Allow me to show you.

904
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:25,142
Would you mind
if we took a stroll on our own?

905
01:13:25,222 --> 01:13:27,543
Just if you'll confine yourself
to the main building.

906
01:13:27,623 --> 01:13:29,303
It's almost bedtime.

907
01:13:29,383 --> 01:13:32,502
<i>We understand. Come, my sweet.</i>

908
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,901
Charlie! You ought to know
better than that!

909
01:13:46,982 --> 01:13:48,861
Sit down. Have a chair.

910
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:10,778
They're all there. Every goddamn name.

911
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:20,018
<i>You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000-acre empire.</i>

912
01:14:20,098 --> 01:14:21,538
They can't be.

913
01:14:25,898 --> 01:14:28,377
<i>They may not know it, but they are.</i>

914
01:14:30,017 --> 01:14:31,616
<i>- Hello, girls.
- Hello.</i>

915
01:14:31,777 --> 01:14:34,138
- Hello.
- Are any of you Emma Dill?

916
01:14:35,777 --> 01:14:38,296
- Yes? Are you Emma?
- Yes.

917
01:14:38,376 --> 01:14:40,857
<i>Well, I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.</i>

918
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:41,936
Why?

919
01:14:42,056 --> 01:14:44,096
Did you know you were
a very wealthy woman?

920
01:14:44,256 --> 01:14:45,976
<i>Oh, I'm not.</i>

921
01:14:46,056 --> 01:14:49,975
<i>- Yes, you are. You own a lot of land.
- No more.</i>

922
01:14:50,776 --> 01:14:51,936
<i>Some time ago,</i>

923
01:14:52,056 --> 01:14:55,894
<i>my late husband owned a good deal
of beach property at Long Beach,</i>

924
01:14:55,975 --> 01:14:57,495
but we lost it.

925
01:14:57,974 --> 01:15:00,375
- That's very beautiful.
- Thanks.

926
01:15:01,095 --> 01:15:02,975
Where did you get
this piece of material?

927
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:04,894
At the Abbacore Club.

928
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:08,654
- Abbacore?
- No. The Albacore.

929
01:15:08,774 --> 01:15:10,614
It's a fish.

930
01:15:10,693 --> 01:15:15,213
<i>My grandson is a member,
and they take very nice care of us.</i>

931
01:15:15,334 --> 01:15:17,133
How do they do that?

932
01:15:17,253 --> 01:15:21,173
<i>Oh, give us things,
not just like this old flag, but...</i>

933
01:15:21,732 --> 01:15:22,652
But what?

934
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:25,973
<i>We're a sort of unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes.</i>

935
01:15:27,093 --> 01:15:30,972
<i>Would you come with me, please?
Someone wants to talk with you.</i>

936
01:15:33,652 --> 01:15:34,612
<i>Goodbye, ladies.</i>

937
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:35,691
- Bye!
- Bye!

938
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:46,491
<i>Come on.
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.</i>

939
01:15:46,612 --> 01:15:48,690
Can we leave the lady out of this?

940
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:51,850
- Yeah. Why not?
- I'd like to see her to the car.

941
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:54,570
- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.

942
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:56,810
Get in the car.

943
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:15,803
Maid's night off?

944
01:17:17,084 --> 01:17:19,563
<i>- Why?
- What do you mean, why?</i>

945
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:23,441
<i>- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.</i>

946
01:17:24,282 --> 01:17:26,362
Easy. It's an innocent question.

947
01:17:26,482 --> 01:17:29,401
<i>No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.</i>

948
01:17:29,521 --> 01:17:31,322
I guess you're right.

949
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:36,081
<i>To you, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

950
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:39,761
<i>Frankly, tonight, you saved my...</i>

951
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,761
You saved my neck.

952
01:17:44,801 --> 01:17:46,520
<i>Tell me, Mr. Gittes,</i>

953
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,080
does this often happen to you?

954
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,040
What's that?

955
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,560
<i>Well, I'm judging only on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening,</i>

956
01:17:56,679 --> 01:17:58,759
<i>but if this is how you go
about your work,</i>

957
01:17:58,879 --> 01:18:02,479
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

958
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:06,759
<i>Actually, this hasn't happened to me
for a long time.</i>

959
01:18:06,878 --> 01:18:08,758
When was the last time?

960
01:18:09,358 --> 01:18:10,399
Why?

961
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:13,157
It's an innocent question.

962
01:18:17,678 --> 01:18:20,837
- In Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

963
01:18:23,117 --> 01:18:26,437
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

964
01:18:26,556 --> 01:18:28,196
As little as possible.

965
01:18:28,316 --> 01:18:31,636
The District Attorney gives his men
advice like that?

966
01:18:32,476 --> 01:18:34,276
They do in Chinatown.

967
01:18:35,396 --> 01:18:37,876
Why did you leave the police force?

968
01:18:41,354 --> 01:18:46,595
<i>Do you have any peroxide,
or anything like that?</i>

969
01:18:46,715 --> 01:18:49,154
Surely. Will you come this way?

970
01:19:05,834 --> 01:19:07,473
My God!

971
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:12,433
It's a nasty cut.

972
01:19:14,353 --> 01:19:15,952
I had no idea...

973
01:19:20,832 --> 01:19:21,951
Sorry!

974
01:19:23,153 --> 01:19:24,352
There.

975
01:19:25,352 --> 01:19:26,831
Is it painful?

976
01:19:30,191 --> 01:19:31,871
It must be painful.

977
01:19:33,831 --> 01:19:35,270
What's wrong?

978
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:37,310
Your eye.

979
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,191
What about it? What?

980
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:46,190
There's something black
in the green part of your eye.

981
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,029
<i>Oh, that.</i>

982
01:19:48,549 --> 01:19:52,668
It's a flaw in the iris.

983
01:19:53,908 --> 01:19:55,950
- A flaw?
- Yes.

984
01:19:57,269 --> 01:19:59,229
A sort of birthmark.

985
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:35,466
Did you wear a uniform?

986
01:20:37,105 --> 01:20:38,465
Sometimes.

987
01:20:40,424 --> 01:20:42,625
Must have looked cute in blue.

988
01:20:44,545 --> 01:20:46,504
<i>Give me a break, will you?</i>

989
01:20:47,024 --> 01:20:48,664
I don't know you.

990
01:20:49,904 --> 01:20:52,185
I want to know more about you.

991
01:20:52,704 --> 01:20:53,983
Not now.

992
01:20:56,144 --> 01:20:59,463
<i>You really don't like to talk
about the past, do you?</i>

993
01:21:01,904 --> 01:21:03,224
I'm tired.

994
01:21:04,064 --> 01:21:06,902
No. Why does it bother you
to talk about it?

995
01:21:07,502 --> 01:21:10,582
- It bothers everybody that works there.
- Where?

996
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:13,341
Chinatown. Everybody.

997
01:21:14,663 --> 01:21:16,862
<i>To me, it was just bad luck.</i>

998
01:21:17,182 --> 01:21:18,261
Why?

999
01:21:21,022 --> 01:21:23,621
You can't always tell what's going on.

1000
01:21:25,701 --> 01:21:27,141
Like with you.

1001
01:21:36,301 --> 01:21:37,660
Why was...

1002
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,660
Why was it bad luck?

1003
01:21:46,299 --> 01:21:49,220
I was trying to keep someone
from being hurt.

1004
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:52,659
I ended up making sure
that she was hurt.

1005
01:22:00,578 --> 01:22:03,058
Was there a woman involved?

1006
01:22:04,738 --> 01:22:06,098
Of course.

1007
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:08,737
Dead?

1008
01:22:21,577 --> 01:22:22,896
<i>Yes, hello?</i>

1009
01:22:25,695 --> 01:22:29,335
<i>Oh, my God.
No, look, don't do anything.</i>

1010
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:31,895
Don't do anything until I get there.

1011
01:22:35,894 --> 01:22:38,494
I have to go.

1012
01:22:39,135 --> 01:22:42,655
- Where?
- Just that I have to.

1013
01:22:43,175 --> 01:22:46,975
<i>- I want to know where you're going.
- No, please. Don't be angry.</i>

1014
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,854
It has nothing to do with you
or with any of all of this. It's just...

1015
01:22:49,974 --> 01:22:52,254
- Where are you going?
- Please...

1016
01:22:55,093 --> 01:22:56,733
Trust me this much.

1017
01:23:07,012 --> 01:23:08,412
I'll be back.

1018
01:23:13,692 --> 01:23:15,132
And there is...

1019
01:23:16,852 --> 01:23:19,371
There is something
that I should tell you about.

1020
01:23:19,491 --> 01:23:23,531
The fishing club
that old lady mentioned...

1021
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:27,931
- The pieces of the flag... Yes.
- The Albacore Club.

1022
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:30,609
- It has to do with my father.
- I know.

1023
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:33,130
He owns it... You know?

1024
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:35,370
I saw him.

1025
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:40,209
You saw

1026
01:23:41,169 --> 01:23:42,409
my father?

1027
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,488
- What... When?
- This morning.

1028
01:23:51,488 --> 01:23:53,129
You didn't tell me.

1029
01:23:53,489 --> 01:23:55,887
<i>Well, there hasn't been much time.</i>

1030
01:23:56,407 --> 01:23:57,527
What...

1031
01:23:58,207 --> 01:23:59,768
What did he say?

1032
01:24:05,086 --> 01:24:06,607
What did he say?

1033
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:08,967
That you were jealous.

1034
01:24:10,526 --> 01:24:12,407
And that he was afraid
what you might do.

1035
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:14,646
Do? To whom?

1036
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:18,046
<i>Mulwray's girlfriend, for one.</i>

1037
01:24:20,367 --> 01:24:22,606
He wanted to know where she was.

1038
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,606
I want you to listen to me.

1039
01:24:27,726 --> 01:24:32,084
<i>Now, my father is
a very dangerous man.</i>

1040
01:24:32,204 --> 01:24:35,685
You don't know how dangerous.
You don't know how crazy.

1041
01:24:36,844 --> 01:24:40,085
Are you trying to tell me
that he might be behind all this?

1042
01:24:40,205 --> 01:24:41,643
It's possible.

1043
01:24:47,884 --> 01:24:50,363
Even the death of your husband?

1044
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:51,923
It's possible.

1045
01:24:52,164 --> 01:24:54,283
<i>Now, please,
don't ask me any more questions now,</i>

1046
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:56,443
just wait. Wait for me here.

1047
01:24:57,523 --> 01:24:59,122
I need you here.

1048
01:28:00,546 --> 01:28:01,866
<i>No, no. Here.</i>

1049
01:28:30,144 --> 01:28:31,704
Give me the keys.

1050
01:28:33,904 --> 01:28:34,904
You...

1051
01:28:35,024 --> 01:28:38,303
It's either that
or you drive yourself to the police.

1052
01:28:38,464 --> 01:28:39,743
The police?

1053
01:28:40,463 --> 01:28:41,663
<i>Come on, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

1054
01:28:41,823 --> 01:28:45,222
You've got your husband's girlfriend
tied up in there.

1055
01:28:45,343 --> 01:28:47,582
- She's not tied up.
- You know what I mean.

1056
01:28:47,663 --> 01:28:50,783
- You're holding her against her will.
- I am not!

1057
01:28:51,783 --> 01:28:54,421
- Okay. Then let's go talk to her.
- No!

1058
01:28:56,062 --> 01:28:57,302
She's...

1059
01:28:57,502 --> 01:28:59,101
She's too upset.

1060
01:29:00,861 --> 01:29:02,181
What about?

1061
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:04,261
Hollis's death.

1062
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:06,461
I tried to keep it from her.

1063
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:10,901
I didn't want her to know until
I could make plans for us to leave.

1064
01:29:11,021 --> 01:29:13,619
You mean she just found out about it?

1065
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:18,460
<i>That's not what it looks like,
Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

1066
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,739
What does it look like?

1067
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,939
Like she knows more
than you want her to tell.

1068
01:29:25,419 --> 01:29:26,939
You're insane.

1069
01:29:27,099 --> 01:29:29,460
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police.

1070
01:29:29,579 --> 01:29:33,059
I don't care what you've done.
I don't want to hurt you.

1071
01:29:37,059 --> 01:29:39,257
You won't go to the police if I tell you?

1072
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:41,138
I will if you don't.

1073
01:29:54,697 --> 01:29:55,897
She...

1074
01:29:55,978 --> 01:29:57,176
She...

1075
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,096
She...

1076
01:30:00,376 --> 01:30:01,936
She's my sister.

1077
01:30:08,095 --> 01:30:09,496
Take it easy.

1078
01:30:10,295 --> 01:30:12,976
<i>If she's your sister, she's your sister.</i>

1079
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,295
Why all the secrecy?

1080
01:30:17,414 --> 01:30:18,615
I can't.

1081
01:30:18,695 --> 01:30:23,095
Is it because of Hollis? Because she
was seeing your husband? Is that it?

1082
01:30:27,013 --> 01:30:29,374
I would never have harmed Hollis.

1083
01:30:30,334 --> 01:30:33,973
<i>He was the most gentle,
decent man imaginable.</i>

1084
01:30:36,134 --> 01:30:39,892
And he put up with more from me
than you'll ever know.

1085
01:30:42,173 --> 01:30:45,692
I wanted him to be happy.

1086
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:07,890
I borrowed your husband's car.
I'll bring it back in the morning.

1087
01:31:08,451 --> 01:31:10,650
But aren't you going...
Coming back with me?

1088
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:13,570
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anybody about this.

1089
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:17,370
That's not what I meant.

1090
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:21,690
Yeah.

1091
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:26,089
<i>Well, I'm tired, Mrs. Mulwray.</i>

1092
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:28,608
Good night.

1093
01:32:31,323 --> 01:32:32,482
<i>Gittes?</i>

1094
01:32:33,803 --> 01:32:35,243
<i>- Gittes?
- Yeah?</i>

1095
01:32:35,803 --> 01:32:38,043
<i>Ida Sessions wants to see you.</i>

1096
01:32:38,163 --> 01:32:41,682
<i>- Who?
- Ida Sessions. You remember Ida.</i>

1097
01:32:43,162 --> 01:32:45,282
<i>- Yeah, I do?
- Sure, you do.</i>

1098
01:32:48,681 --> 01:32:50,481
<i>I tell you what, pal.</i>

1099
01:32:51,561 --> 01:32:55,721
<i>If Ida wants to see me,
she can call me at my office.</i>

1100
01:33:21,559 --> 01:33:25,918
<i>848-1/2 East Kensington. Echo Park.</i>

1101
01:33:26,038 --> 01:33:28,958
<i>She begged me to call.
She's waiting for you.</i>

1102
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:31,223
<i>Find anything interesting, Gittes?</i>

1103
01:36:35,301 --> 01:36:37,301
What are you doing around here?

1104
01:36:37,381 --> 01:36:39,102
Didn't you call me?

1105
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:43,100
How come you happen to know her?

1106
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,741
I don't.

1107
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:50,100
Come here.
I want to show you something.

1108
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:01,819
- Isn't that your phone number?
- Is it?

1109
01:37:01,978 --> 01:37:04,059
I forget. I don't call myself that often.

1110
01:37:04,219 --> 01:37:07,059
<i>Well, just to make sure,
we had Loach here give you a call.</i>

1111
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:08,739
<i>What happened to your nose, Gittes?</i>

1112
01:37:08,859 --> 01:37:10,898
Somebody slam
a bedroom window on it?

1113
01:37:13,498 --> 01:37:17,018
Nope. Your wife got excited.
She crossed her legs a little too quick.

1114
01:37:17,098 --> 01:37:18,898
<i>You understand what I mean, pal?</i>

1115
01:37:19,778 --> 01:37:20,858
Loach.

1116
01:37:40,456 --> 01:37:42,136
They look familiar?

1117
01:37:43,295 --> 01:37:46,455
- Yeah. I took them. So what?
- How did she happen to have them?

1118
01:37:46,615 --> 01:37:50,015
Either you tell me or I guess.
I don't know the answer.

1119
01:37:50,376 --> 01:37:52,536
<i>You must really think I'm stupid,
don't you, Gittes?</i>

1120
01:37:52,696 --> 01:37:54,015
<i>I don't think about it that much,</i>

1121
01:37:54,175 --> 01:37:57,015
but give me a day or two
and I'll get back to you.

1122
01:37:57,175 --> 01:38:00,535
<i>- Now I'd like to go home.
- I want the other pictures, Gittes.</i>

1123
01:38:00,614 --> 01:38:02,094
What pictures?

1124
01:38:02,814 --> 01:38:06,134
<i>This broad hired you,
not Evelyn Mulwray.</i>

1125
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,614
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1126
01:38:08,693 --> 01:38:10,294
<i>Somebody wanted
to shake Mulwray down,</i>

1127
01:38:10,374 --> 01:38:11,894
she hired you.

1128
01:38:11,974 --> 01:38:14,333
That's how come you found out
he was murdered.

1129
01:38:14,493 --> 01:38:17,333
<i>- I heard it was an accident.
- Come on, Gittes.</i>

1130
01:38:17,493 --> 01:38:20,693
<i>Who the hell do you think you're
dealing with, a bunch of assholes?</i>

1131
01:38:20,773 --> 01:38:22,972
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

1132
01:38:25,012 --> 01:38:27,772
You were following him day and night.
You saw who killed him.

1133
01:38:27,932 --> 01:38:29,813
You even took pictures of it.

1134
01:38:29,973 --> 01:38:31,051
<i>It was Evelyn Mulwray,</i>

1135
01:38:31,131 --> 01:38:34,251
and she's been paying you off
like a slot machine ever since.

1136
01:38:34,331 --> 01:38:37,012
- You accusing me of extortion?
- Absolutely.

1137
01:38:37,092 --> 01:38:38,731
I don't think I need a day or two.

1138
01:38:38,811 --> 01:38:40,851
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.

1139
01:38:41,010 --> 01:38:43,890
<i>Not only that, but I wouldn't extort
a nickel from my worst enemy, Escobar.</i>

1140
01:38:43,971 --> 01:38:45,491
That's where I draw the line.

1141
01:38:45,651 --> 01:38:47,691
<i>I want the rest of the pictures, Gittes.</i>

1142
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:49,449
<i>We're talking about accessory
after the fact,</i>

1143
01:38:49,529 --> 01:38:51,130
<i>conspiracy, and extortion, minimum.</i>

1144
01:38:51,289 --> 01:38:53,610
<i>What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray
knocked off her husband in the ocean,</i>

1145
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:54,970
then dragged him up to a reservoir

1146
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:57,770
because she thought
it would look more like an accident?

1147
01:38:59,169 --> 01:39:00,409
Mulwray was murdered and moved

1148
01:39:00,529 --> 01:39:04,089
because somebody didn't want his body
found in the ocean.

1149
01:39:04,209 --> 01:39:05,169
Why is that?

1150
01:39:05,249 --> 01:39:07,128
He found out
they were dumping water there.

1151
01:39:07,248 --> 01:39:10,009
That's what they were trying to cover up.

1152
01:39:10,968 --> 01:39:14,728
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on. I'll show you.

1153
01:39:15,929 --> 01:39:18,968
<i>Come on, Lou. You're in charge.
Make a decision.</i>

1154
01:39:36,407 --> 01:39:38,006
- It's too late.
- Too late for what?

1155
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:40,565
They only dump the water at night.

1156
01:39:42,286 --> 01:39:45,125
- Reach anybody?
- Yelburton. He's the new chief.

1157
01:39:45,245 --> 01:39:47,845
<i>- Yeah, I know who he is. Go on!
- He says...</i>

1158
01:39:47,964 --> 01:39:50,205
- I know what he says.
- Shut up.

1159
01:39:51,645 --> 01:39:52,684
Go on!

1160
01:39:52,764 --> 01:39:54,564
<i>Yelburton says there's irrigation
in the Valley,</i>

1161
01:39:54,684 --> 01:39:56,724
and there's always a little run-off
after they do that.

1162
01:39:56,884 --> 01:39:58,325
<i>And he says Gittes knows this,</i>

1163
01:39:58,444 --> 01:40:02,724
and he's been going around making
irresponsible accusations all last week.

1164
01:40:02,844 --> 01:40:04,403
<i>Lou, let's swear out a warrant
for her arrest.</i>

1165
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:06,284
What the hell are we waiting for?

1166
01:40:06,363 --> 01:40:10,803
He just made lieutenant.
Wants to hang on to his little gold bar.

1167
01:40:14,482 --> 01:40:16,803
Have your client in my office
in two hours.

1168
01:40:16,923 --> 01:40:19,282
<i>And remember,
I don't have to let you go.</i>

1169
01:40:19,442 --> 01:40:22,323
I've got you right now
for withholding evidence.

1170
01:40:23,482 --> 01:40:24,682
Loach?

1171
01:41:08,478 --> 01:41:10,238
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

1172
01:41:11,918 --> 01:41:13,437
These her bags?

1173
01:41:15,997 --> 01:41:17,877
Is she going on a trip?

1174
01:41:18,637 --> 01:41:21,398
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

1175
01:41:21,518 --> 01:41:24,757
- Is she going on a vacation?
- Mrs. Mulwray no home.

1176
01:41:25,157 --> 01:41:29,036
<i>"Mrs. Mulwray no home."
Well, I'll just have a look around, huh?</i>

1177
01:41:35,916 --> 01:41:37,756
<i>Yeah, yeah. Bad for the glass.</i>

1178
01:41:37,876 --> 01:41:40,075
<i>Oh, yes. Bad for glass.</i>

1179
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:42,795
Salt water very bad for glass.

1180
01:41:57,954 --> 01:41:59,233
Salt water?

1181
01:41:59,913 --> 01:42:02,553
<i>Very, very bad. See?</i>

1182
01:42:11,113 --> 01:42:12,473
What's that?

1183
01:42:14,193 --> 01:42:15,553
Right there.

1184
01:42:19,271 --> 01:42:20,391
There.

1185
01:43:15,827 --> 01:43:17,627
- You wait.
- You wait.

1186
01:43:22,986 --> 01:43:25,146
How are you? I've been calling you.

1187
01:43:25,226 --> 01:43:26,586
<i>- Yeah?
- It's all right, Kahn.</i>

1188
01:43:26,706 --> 01:43:28,745
- Have you slept?
- Sure.

1189
01:43:29,865 --> 01:43:32,105
Have you had lunch?
Kahn can fix you something.

1190
01:43:32,225 --> 01:43:35,266
- Where's the girl?
- Upstairs. Why?

1191
01:43:35,385 --> 01:43:37,025
I want to see her.

1192
01:43:37,425 --> 01:43:41,185
She's having a bath right now.
Why do you want to see her?

1193
01:43:41,305 --> 01:43:42,865
Going someplace?

1194
01:43:43,825 --> 01:43:46,426
Yes. We have a 5:30 train to catch.

1195
01:43:50,143 --> 01:43:51,263
Jake?

1196
01:44:00,463 --> 01:44:02,903
J.J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar.

1197
01:44:03,303 --> 01:44:05,941
<i>But... Now look, what's the matter?
What's wrong?</i>

1198
01:44:06,022 --> 01:44:09,942
<i>- I told you, we have a 5:30...
- You're going to miss your train.</i>

1199
01:44:10,462 --> 01:44:11,582
<i>Lieutenant Escobar.</i>

1200
01:44:11,742 --> 01:44:12,743
<i>- Lou?
- Yeah.</i>

1201
01:44:12,863 --> 01:44:15,462
Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.

1202
01:44:17,181 --> 01:44:19,101
Yeah. Soon as you can.

1203
01:44:20,062 --> 01:44:21,782
Why did you do that?

1204
01:44:22,222 --> 01:44:24,980
- You know any good criminal lawyers?
- No.

1205
01:44:26,781 --> 01:44:29,461
<i>Don't worry, I can recommend a couple.</i>

1206
01:44:29,981 --> 01:44:32,820
<i>They're expensive, but you can afford it.</i>

1207
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:36,659
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

1208
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:50,978
I found these in your backyard
in the pond.

1209
01:44:52,058 --> 01:44:54,658
<i>They belonged to your husband,
didn't they?</i>

1210
01:44:54,778 --> 01:44:56,218
Didn't they?

1211
01:44:57,058 --> 01:45:00,218
<i>- I don't know. Yes, probably.
- Yes, positively.</i>

1212
01:45:00,298 --> 01:45:02,258
It's where he was drowned.

1213
01:45:02,497 --> 01:45:03,457
What?

1214
01:45:03,577 --> 01:45:06,098
There's no time
to be shocked by the truth.

1215
01:45:06,178 --> 01:45:07,578
The coroner's report proves

1216
01:45:07,738 --> 01:45:09,976
that he had salt water in his lungs
when he was killed.

1217
01:45:10,057 --> 01:45:11,376
<i>Just take my word for it, all right?</i>

1218
01:45:11,457 --> 01:45:13,457
<i>Now, I want to know how it happened,
and I want to know why,</i>

1219
01:45:13,537 --> 01:45:15,456
<i>and I want to know
before Escobar gets here,</i>

1220
01:45:15,577 --> 01:45:17,456
because I don't want to lose my license.

1221
01:45:17,535 --> 01:45:21,456
<i>I don't know what you are talking about.
This is the craziest, most insane thing...</i>

1222
01:45:21,536 --> 01:45:22,936
Stop it!

1223
01:45:23,096 --> 01:45:24,695
I'm gonna make it easy for you.

1224
01:45:24,856 --> 01:45:27,415
You were jealous. You had a fight.
He fell. He hit his head.

1225
01:45:27,575 --> 01:45:28,535
It was an accident!

1226
01:45:28,695 --> 01:45:31,215
But his girl is a witness.
So you had to shut her up.

1227
01:45:31,295 --> 01:45:32,375
<i>You don't have the guts to harm her,</i>

1228
01:45:32,536 --> 01:45:34,295
but you got the money
to keep her mouth shut.

1229
01:45:34,375 --> 01:45:35,894
- Yes or no?
- No!

1230
01:45:37,174 --> 01:45:39,415
<i>Who is she? And don't give me
that crap about your sister,</i>

1231
01:45:39,575 --> 01:45:41,495
because you don't have a sister.

1232
01:45:41,654 --> 01:45:43,214
I'll tell you...

1233
01:45:43,614 --> 01:45:45,534
I'll tell you the truth.

1234
01:45:47,413 --> 01:45:49,174
Good. What's her name?

1235
01:45:50,973 --> 01:45:53,613
- Katherine.
- Katherine who?

1236
01:45:55,973 --> 01:45:57,653
She's my daughter.

1237
01:45:58,813 --> 01:46:00,733
I said I want the truth!

1238
01:46:01,253 --> 01:46:02,892
She's my sister.

1239
01:46:04,252 --> 01:46:05,852
She's my daughter.

1240
01:46:06,852 --> 01:46:08,732
<i>My sister, my daughter!</i>

1241
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:11,251
I said I want the truth!

1242
01:46:11,411 --> 01:46:12,691
All of it!

1243
01:46:14,851 --> 01:46:17,491
She's my sister and my daughter!

1244
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:23,130
<i>Kahn, please, go back.</i>

1245
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:25,931
<i>For God's sake, keep her upstairs.
Go back!</i>

1246
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:34,930
My father and I...

1247
01:46:39,329 --> 01:46:40,649
Understand?

1248
01:46:41,529 --> 01:46:43,568
Or is it too tough for you?

1249
01:46:52,368 --> 01:46:53,769
He raped you?

1250
01:47:09,726 --> 01:47:11,367
Then what happened?

1251
01:47:11,647 --> 01:47:13,006
I ran away.

1252
01:47:13,367 --> 01:47:14,685
To Mexico.

1253
01:47:20,965 --> 01:47:24,165
Hollis came and took care of me.

1254
01:47:27,165 --> 01:47:28,885
I couldn't see her.

1255
01:47:30,044 --> 01:47:31,365
I was 15.

1256
01:47:34,924 --> 01:47:36,764
<i>I wanted to, but I...</i>

1257
01:47:38,045 --> 01:47:39,324
I couldn't.

1258
01:47:41,843 --> 01:47:42,963
Then...

1259
01:47:45,604 --> 01:47:47,643
Now I want to be with her.

1260
01:47:48,443 --> 01:47:50,483
I want to take care of her.

1261
01:47:50,842 --> 01:47:52,883
Where are you going to take her now?

1262
01:47:53,042 --> 01:47:54,523
Back to Mexico.

1263
01:47:55,802 --> 01:48:00,362
<i>Well, you can't take the train. Escobar
will be looking for you everywhere.</i>

1264
01:48:02,681 --> 01:48:07,362
<i>Well, how about a plane?</i>

1265
01:48:07,482 --> 01:48:08,560
<i>No, that's worse.</i>

1266
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:11,921
You better just get out of here.
Leave all this stuff here.

1267
01:48:12,041 --> 01:48:15,721
Where does Kahn live?
Get the exact address.

1268
01:48:16,561 --> 01:48:17,841
All right.

1269
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:24,561
Those didn't belong to Hollis.

1270
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,559
How do you know?

1271
01:48:26,919 --> 01:48:28,839
He didn't wear bifocals.

1272
01:48:59,077 --> 01:49:02,676
<i>Katherine, say hello to Mr. Gittes.</i>

1273
01:49:02,917 --> 01:49:04,076
Hello.

1274
01:49:04,997 --> 01:49:06,076
Hello.

1275
01:49:10,917 --> 01:49:14,275
He lives at 1712 Alameda.
Do you know where that is?

1276
01:49:17,236 --> 01:49:18,316
Sure.

1277
01:49:38,514 --> 01:49:40,233
<i>J.J. Gittes and Associates.</i>

1278
01:49:40,353 --> 01:49:43,033
<i>- Sophie, get me Walsh.
- Yes, Mr. Gittes.</i>

1279
01:49:44,114 --> 01:49:45,593
<i>- Jake?
- Yeah.</i>

1280
01:49:45,713 --> 01:49:49,153
<i>Listen, pal, Escobar's going to try
and book me in about five minutes.</i>

1281
01:49:49,273 --> 01:49:50,712
<i>What? What the hell's the matter?
What...</i>

1282
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:52,712
Relax and I'll tell you.

1283
01:49:52,832 --> 01:49:54,872
Wait in the office for me
about two hours.

1284
01:49:54,992 --> 01:49:59,312
<i>If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy
meet me at 1712 Alameda.</i>

1285
01:50:00,152 --> 01:50:02,912
<i>Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it?</i>

1286
01:50:03,032 --> 01:50:04,871
I know where it is. Just do it.

1287
01:50:04,991 --> 01:50:06,950
<i>1712 Alameda...</i>

1288
01:50:34,588 --> 01:50:36,149
<i>Come on in, Lou.</i>

1289
01:50:37,388 --> 01:50:41,068
Looks like we're both too late.
She flew the coop.

1290
01:50:46,187 --> 01:50:49,348
I don't suppose you have any idea
where she went.

1291
01:50:49,468 --> 01:50:52,107
<i>- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Where?</i>

1292
01:50:52,227 --> 01:50:54,946
Her maid's house.
I think she knows something's up.

1293
01:50:55,067 --> 01:50:57,107
What's the maid's address?

1294
01:50:57,587 --> 01:50:59,387
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down.

1295
01:50:59,507 --> 01:51:02,346
<i>No, no, no, Gittes.
You're going to show us.</i>

1296
01:51:03,107 --> 01:51:04,346
What for?

1297
01:51:05,146 --> 01:51:07,146
<i>Because if she ain't there,
you're going downtown,</i>

1298
01:51:07,265 --> 01:51:10,305
and you're gonna stay there
until she does show up.

1299
01:51:10,945 --> 01:51:13,425
<i>Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.</i>

1300
01:51:14,785 --> 01:51:17,545
Tell us about it
on the way to San Pedro.

1301
01:51:30,264 --> 01:51:33,824
<i>- Let's get the little lady.
- Lou, can I ask you a favor?</i>

1302
01:51:34,343 --> 01:51:36,983
I'd like to bring her out myself.

1303
01:51:37,063 --> 01:51:40,462
She's not armed or nothing.
She won't be a problem.

1304
01:51:40,543 --> 01:51:44,303
I just want a minute alone with her.
It would mean a lot to her.

1305
01:51:44,383 --> 01:51:45,661
And to me.

1306
01:51:50,143 --> 01:51:52,422
<i>You never learn, do you, Jake?</i>

1307
01:51:54,061 --> 01:51:55,462
I guess not.

1308
01:51:58,301 --> 01:51:59,781
Okay. But...

1309
01:52:01,662 --> 01:52:03,620
I'll give you three minutes.

1310
01:52:03,741 --> 01:52:05,140
Just three minutes.

1311
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:06,900
<i>Gee, thanks, Lou.</i>

1312
01:52:22,379 --> 01:52:23,499
Yes?

1313
01:52:24,659 --> 01:52:25,739
Hello.

1314
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:29,979
<i>Mr. Gittes! Come in!
Well, this is some surprise, Mr. Gittes.</i>

1315
01:52:30,099 --> 01:52:31,858
<i>Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly?</i>

1316
01:52:31,978 --> 01:52:33,858
Just sitting down for supper.
You care to join us?

1317
01:52:33,979 --> 01:52:35,099
<i>No, thanks.</i>

1318
01:52:35,218 --> 01:52:36,898
How about a glass of wine?

1319
01:52:37,018 --> 01:52:39,537
<i>- Hey, honey, this is the fellow that...
- I know.</i>

1320
01:52:39,657 --> 01:52:42,818
<i>No, thank you, Curly, very much,
but I would like a glass of water, though.</i>

1321
01:52:42,938 --> 01:52:44,777
<i>Come on out in the kitchen with me
for a second, huh?</i>

1322
01:52:44,897 --> 01:52:46,177
Sure thing.

1323
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:51,896
<i>- Curly, where's your car?
- In the garage.</i>

1324
01:52:52,017 --> 01:52:54,097
- Where's that?
- Off the alley.

1325
01:52:54,217 --> 01:52:56,696
<i>- Can you give me a ride somewhere?
- Sure, soon as we eat.</i>

1326
01:52:56,817 --> 01:52:59,095
<i>Right now, Curly. It can't wait.</i>

1327
01:52:59,495 --> 01:53:02,296
<i>- I'll tell my wife.
- Tell her later, Curl, huh?</i>

1328
01:53:33,053 --> 01:53:35,893
<i>Just drive slow for a block or two,
will you, Curly?</i>

1329
01:53:36,052 --> 01:53:40,213
- What's this all about?
- I'll tell you in a block or two.

1330
01:53:41,532 --> 01:53:43,172
How much do you owe me?

1331
01:53:43,292 --> 01:53:46,131
<i>Gee, Mr. Gittes,
we're going out tomorrow.</i>

1332
01:53:46,251 --> 01:53:49,812
<i>I know you been real good about it,
but my cousin Auggie's sick.</i>

1333
01:53:49,932 --> 01:53:51,690
Forget it.
How would you like to pay me off

1334
01:53:51,771 --> 01:53:54,771
by taking a couple of passengers
to Ensenada?

1335
01:53:54,931 --> 01:53:58,251
- You'd have to leave tonight.
- I don't know.

1336
01:53:58,331 --> 01:54:02,450
I might be able to squeeze 75 bucks
out of it for you.

1337
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:04,770
Maybe even 100.

1338
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:09,010
<i>- Plus what I owe?
- I'll throw that in, too.</i>

1339
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:13,570
1712 Alameda. It's in Chinatown.
Wait for me until 8:30.

1340
01:54:13,690 --> 01:54:16,529
<i>If I don't show up,
take them to your boat.</i>

1341
01:54:29,088 --> 01:54:30,927
You sure this is okay?

1342
01:54:31,728 --> 01:54:35,008
<i>Curly, you know how long
I've been in this business?</i>

1343
01:55:01,245 --> 01:55:05,204
<i>Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.</i>

1344
01:55:06,245 --> 01:55:08,364
<i>You've got her? Where?</i>

1345
01:55:08,445 --> 01:55:10,444
Do you remember
the figures we discussed?

1346
01:55:10,564 --> 01:55:12,604
<i>Of course I do. Where are you?</i>

1347
01:55:12,764 --> 01:55:15,924
At your daughter's house.
How soon can you get here?

1348
01:55:16,084 --> 01:55:17,244
<i>An hour.</i>

1349
01:55:40,202 --> 01:55:42,001
<i>Oh, there you are.</i>

1350
01:55:42,121 --> 01:55:46,322
<i>Well, you don't look too much the worse
for wear, Mr. Gitts, I must say.</i>

1351
01:55:47,122 --> 01:55:49,041
- Where's the girl?
- I've got her.

1352
01:55:49,161 --> 01:55:51,280
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

1353
01:55:51,962 --> 01:55:53,641
<i>Well, where is she?</i>

1354
01:55:54,201 --> 01:55:55,801
With her mother.

1355
01:55:57,521 --> 01:56:00,520
<i>I got something
I'd like to show you, Mr. Cross.</i>

1356
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,720
What is it?

1357
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:05,320
An obituary column.
Can you see all right in this light?

1358
01:56:05,641 --> 01:56:07,079
I guess I can manage.

1359
01:56:16,478 --> 01:56:17,998
What does it mean?

1360
01:56:18,119 --> 01:56:20,358
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

1361
01:56:21,318 --> 01:56:22,679
<i>Right here,</i>

1362
01:56:22,958 --> 01:56:24,398
in that pond.

1363
01:56:25,078 --> 01:56:26,638
You drowned him.

1364
01:56:27,878 --> 01:56:29,557
And you left these.

1365
01:56:31,718 --> 01:56:35,637
The coroner's report shows Mulwray
had salt water in his lungs.

1366
01:56:39,077 --> 01:56:43,076
Hollis was always fascinated
by tide pools.

1367
01:56:44,076 --> 01:56:45,997
You know what he used to say?

1368
01:56:46,117 --> 01:56:47,596
I haven't the faintest idea.

1369
01:56:47,716 --> 01:56:49,676
"That's where life begins."

1370
01:56:49,796 --> 01:56:51,597
<i>Sloughs, tide pools.</i>

1371
01:56:53,155 --> 01:56:54,155
<i>When we first come out here,</i>

1372
01:56:54,275 --> 01:56:56,915
he figured if you dumped water
into desert sand

1373
01:56:57,035 --> 01:57:00,796
<i>and let it percolate down to the bedrock,
it would stay there</i>

1374
01:57:00,954 --> 01:57:03,834
instead of evaporate
the way it does in most reservoirs.

1375
01:57:03,994 --> 01:57:07,475
You'd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80.
He made this city.

1376
01:57:07,554 --> 01:57:09,275
And that's what you were going to do
in the Valley.

1377
01:57:09,435 --> 01:57:10,674
It's what I am doing.

1378
01:57:11,034 --> 01:57:12,594
<i>When the bond issue passes Tuesday,</i>

1379
01:57:12,753 --> 01:57:14,874
there'll be $8 million
to build an aqueduct and a reservoir.

1380
01:57:15,034 --> 01:57:16,394
I'm doing it.

1381
01:57:16,473 --> 01:57:17,994
Gonna be a lot of irate citizens

1382
01:57:18,075 --> 01:57:21,233
when they find out that they're paying
for water that they're not gonna get.

1383
01:57:21,313 --> 01:57:23,192
<i>Oh, that's all taken care of.</i>

1384
01:57:23,352 --> 01:57:27,193
<i>See, Mr. Gitts,
either you bring the water to L. A.,</i>

1385
01:57:27,353 --> 01:57:29,552
or you bring L.A. to the water.

1386
01:57:30,191 --> 01:57:31,193
How are you gonna do that?

1387
01:57:31,353 --> 01:57:34,992
By incorporating the Valley into the city.
Simple as that.

1388
01:57:36,632 --> 01:57:38,711
- How much are you worth?
- I have no idea.

1389
01:57:38,872 --> 01:57:39,911
How much do you want?

1390
01:57:39,992 --> 01:57:42,391
<i>No, I just want to know
what you're worth. Over $10 million?</i>

1391
01:57:42,511 --> 01:57:45,391
<i>- Oh my, yes.
- Why are you doing it?</i>

1392
01:57:45,472 --> 01:57:46,510
How much better can you eat?

1393
01:57:46,670 --> 01:57:48,750
What can you buy
that you can't already afford?

1394
01:57:48,910 --> 01:57:50,671
<i>The future, Mr. Gitts!</i>

1395
01:57:51,151 --> 01:57:52,471
The future!

1396
01:57:53,271 --> 01:57:55,029
<i>Now, where's the girl?</i>

1397
01:57:55,149 --> 01:57:57,350
I want the only daughter I've got left.

1398
01:57:57,430 --> 01:58:00,470
<i>As you found out,
Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.</i>

1399
01:58:00,629 --> 01:58:02,869
Who do you blame for that? Her?

1400
01:58:03,389 --> 01:58:05,110
I don't blame myself.

1401
01:58:06,389 --> 01:58:09,548
<i>See, Mr. Gitts, most people
never have to face the fact</i>

1402
01:58:09,629 --> 01:58:12,110
<i>that at the right time and the right place,</i>

1403
01:58:12,189 --> 01:58:14,308
they're capable of anything.

1404
01:58:16,428 --> 01:58:19,509
<i>Claude, take those glasses from him,
will you?</i>

1405
01:58:26,427 --> 01:58:28,627
<i>It's not worth it, Mr. Gitts.</i>

1406
01:58:30,548 --> 01:58:32,466
It's really not worth it.

1407
01:58:38,867 --> 01:58:39,787
Where's the girl?

1408
01:59:32,702 --> 01:59:35,660
<i>You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill, don't you, boys?</i>

1409
01:59:35,820 --> 01:59:39,181
<i>Mr. Cross, these are my associates,
Mr. Walsh and Mr...</i>

1410
01:59:40,381 --> 01:59:42,421
<i>You're under arrest, Jake.</i>

1411
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,540
Good news.

1412
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:49,140
<i>Withholding evidence, extortion,
accessory after the fact.</i>

1413
01:59:49,261 --> 01:59:51,460
<i>I didn't extort nothing from nobody, Lou.</i>

1414
01:59:51,541 --> 01:59:54,739
<i>This is Noah Cross, if you don't know.
Evelyn's father, if you don't know.</i>

1415
01:59:54,859 --> 01:59:56,940
<i>He's the bird you're after, Lou.
I can explain everything.</i>

1416
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:58,060
- Lieutenant?
- Just give me five minutes.

1417
01:59:58,140 --> 01:59:59,180
That's all I need.

1418
01:59:59,259 --> 02:00:01,300
- He's rich! Do you understand?
- Shut up!

1419
02:00:01,458 --> 02:00:03,499
He thinks he can get away
with anything!

1420
02:00:03,579 --> 02:00:05,739
Shut up or I'm gonna lock you in
to the wheel of that car.

1421
02:00:05,819 --> 02:00:09,419
<i>Lieutenant, I am rich, I am Noah Cross.</i>

1422
02:00:10,099 --> 02:00:12,417
<i>- Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.
- He's crazy, Lou!</i>

1423
02:00:12,538 --> 02:00:14,097
He killed Mulwray because
of the water thing!

1424
02:00:14,258 --> 02:00:15,177
- I'm telling...
- Water?

1425
02:00:15,337 --> 02:00:16,339
Would you just listen to me
for five minutes?

1426
02:00:16,499 --> 02:00:19,138
<i>Loach, lock him to the wheel of that car.</i>

1427
02:00:20,057 --> 02:00:22,818
<i>Lou, you don't know
what's going on here. I'm telling you.</i>

1428
02:00:22,938 --> 02:00:24,257
Katherine!

1429
02:00:24,458 --> 02:00:25,578
Katherine.

1430
02:00:25,657 --> 02:00:30,337
<i>- I am your grandfather, my dear.
- Come, miss.</i>

1431
02:00:30,457 --> 02:00:32,017
<i>- I'm your grandfather.
- Come, miss.</i>

1432
02:00:32,137 --> 02:00:33,736
<i>Katherine, get in the car.</i>

1433
02:00:33,816 --> 02:00:35,136
<i>- Go on, go on.
- But, ma'am...</i>

1434
02:00:35,256 --> 02:00:38,256
<i>No, no, go back to the Hong Kong.
I'll follow. It's all right.</i>

1435
02:00:39,096 --> 02:00:40,975
Get away from her. Get away!

1436
02:00:41,135 --> 02:00:45,736
<i>Evelyn. Please, please, be reasonable.</i>

1437
02:00:45,816 --> 02:00:48,134
- Come to my...
- Get away from her!

1438
02:00:48,214 --> 02:00:49,455
Evelyn!

1439
02:00:50,615 --> 02:00:53,375
How many years have I got?

1440
02:00:53,974 --> 02:00:55,456
<i>She's mine, too.</i>

1441
02:00:55,575 --> 02:00:57,854
She's never going to know that!

1442
02:00:59,974 --> 02:01:04,014
<i>Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman.
You cannot hope to provide.</i>

1443
02:01:04,134 --> 02:01:06,733
<i>Evelyn, put that gun away!
Let the police handle this!</i>

1444
02:01:06,893 --> 02:01:08,614
He owns the police!

1445
02:01:09,414 --> 02:01:10,893
Get away from her.

1446
02:01:11,013 --> 02:01:14,052
- You'll have to kill me first.
- Get away! Get...

1447
02:01:15,213 --> 02:01:17,213
<i>Katherine, close the door.</i>

1448
02:01:18,053 --> 02:01:19,132
Halt!

1449
02:01:58,010 --> 02:01:59,369
<i>Oh, no!</i>

1450
02:01:59,448 --> 02:02:02,049
Better call the captain.
Get an ambulance.

1451
02:02:02,169 --> 02:02:04,049
- No!
- Turn him loose. Turn them all loose.

1452
02:02:04,169 --> 02:02:05,649
- Lord.
- No!

1453
02:02:09,127 --> 02:02:10,288
Lord.

1454
02:02:10,768 --> 02:02:12,047
Lord.

1455
02:02:13,608 --> 02:02:15,009
No! No!

1456
02:02:16,727 --> 02:02:20,327
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.

1457
02:02:32,406 --> 02:02:34,925
- As little as possible.
- What's that?

1458
02:02:38,125 --> 02:02:39,525
What's that?

1459
02:02:43,884 --> 02:02:46,644
You want to do your partner
a big favor?

1460
02:02:48,245 --> 02:02:49,645
Take him home.

1461
02:02:53,163 --> 02:02:54,604
Take him home!

1462
02:02:54,925 --> 02:02:57,324
Just get him the hell out of here!

1463
02:02:57,444 --> 02:02:58,884
<i>Come on, Jake.</i>

1464
02:02:59,923 --> 02:03:01,324
<i>Go home, Jake.</i>

1465
02:03:02,324 --> 02:03:04,283
I'm doing you a favor.

1466
02:03:05,802 --> 02:03:07,244
<i>Come on, Jake.</i>

1467
02:03:10,283 --> 02:03:12,562
<i>Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.</i>

1468
02:03:26,842 --> 02:03:30,480
<i>All right, come on. Clear the area!
On the sidewalk!</i>

1469
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,081
On the sidewalk!

1470
02:03:36,121 --> 02:03:37,801
Get off the street!

1471
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,760
Get off the street!
