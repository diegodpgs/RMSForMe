1
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,709
- Did you say it might take a while?
- It's OK.

2
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:40,236
- We could phone them.
- No, it's OK.

3
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:45,074
It could take till tonight,
depending on how things go.

4
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,870
- It's a strange story.
- Really?

5
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:53,757
Well, it seems that

6
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:57,468
someone has been passing himself off

7
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,437
as Mohsen Makhmalbaf, do you know him?

8
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,033
- A businessman?
- No, not at all.

9
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,677
Do I turn left here?

10
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:09,871
He's not a businessman, he's a filmmaker.

11
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,870
- Do you know him?
- No.

12
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,871
<i>The Cyclist</i> is his latest film.

13
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,950
I've no time for the cinema!

14
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:22,430
He's a filmmaker,
but his face isn't very well-known.

15
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,229
And this guy told a family
he was Makhmalbaf.

16
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,232
It's not clear what his intentions were.

17
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,552
He chose a few members
of this family to be actors

18
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:40,791
and told them their house was ideal

19
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,110
as the location for his next film.

20
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:49,478
But no one knows
what his intentions really are.

21
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,717
I'm a journalist and I'm going there

22
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,552
to cover his arrest.

23
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:00,790
- You're a journalist?
- For Sorush Magazine.

24
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,268
I thought you were a policeman!

25
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,993
That's funny!

26
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,752
I was told about this case

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,593
and I thought it would make a good story.

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,956
I'm going to follow
this case through to the end.

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,794
You don't hear of a story like this every day.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,795
Godsends like this only come
a couple of times in your career.

31
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,472
It's a hot news item.

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,758
Sensational news.
The kind of news that boosts sales.

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,755
It's what I call an Oriana-style story.

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,832
By the way, do you know Fallaci?

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,670
No.

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,955
Bogdanovich? Edisson?

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,429
They're fellow journalists.

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,590
They're not my clients!

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,793
But they're fellow journalists.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,111
They write sensational reports.

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,554
Oriana Fallaci writes
some very original articles.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,270
She has a gift for finding stories
that no one else does.

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,194
She has a worldwide reputation.

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,348
And I'm sure this is
a new Oriana-style report.

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,998
I must find out if he had any illicit plans

46
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,753
such as stealing from them.

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,594
I'll know that once he's been arrested,

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,638
so I'll need you till tonight.

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,995
- Fine by me.
- Good.

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,870
Give your boss a call when we get there.

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,839
It's OK, I don't work for them
full-time anyway.

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,229
I'm a retired fighter pilot.

53
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,595
I'm one of the ground staff now!

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,593
Funny, a pilot working on the ground!

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,910
That could be a good scoop, too!

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,950
- Left here?
- Yes.

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,952
- To Lavizan?
- Yes, then Hosseinabad Avenue.

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,670
Lavizan is a nice area.
I lived there before the Revolution.

59
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,479
I left when the unrest started

60
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,471
at the Lavizan garrison.

61
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,356
When the soldiers rioted...

62
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,999
I haven't been back since.

63
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,749
We're going to Javanshir Avenue.

64
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,672
Keep going, I'll ask someone the way.

65
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,554
Let's see if this boy can help.

66
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:40,477
- Excuse me. Where's Javanshir Avenue?
- I don't know.

67
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:43,312
- He doesn't know.
- Ask an adult.

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,835
Let's ask this man.

69
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,911
Excuse me. Where is Golzar Avenue?

70
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,433
I don't know.

71
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,510
- Want a turkey?
- No.

72
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,638
We're off to see a family
who were made turkeys of!

73
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:01,153
How did you hear of this story?

74
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:06,472
A composer friend called me
and said strange things were afoot

75
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,948
in his friend's house.

76
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,314
It's a strange place to choose.

77
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,351
Where's Golzar Avenue?

78
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,472
Straight on, then left
just after the supermarket.

79
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:22,835
- Straight on, then left?
- Yes.

80
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,830
Thanks.

81
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,593
This is a once-in-a-lifetime story
for a journalist.

82
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,997
You can't imagine how impatient I am

83
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,232
to see this report on the front page.

84
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,708
It'll cause a sensation.

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,553
Everyone in TV and cinema

86
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,391
will talk about it.

87
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,035
Let me see...

88
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,075
First Avenue off Golzar Avenue.

89
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,719
Here it is. First Avenue.

90
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:00,512
That way.

91
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,314
Is this it?

92
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,638
Yes, but it's a dead end.

93
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:15,110
It's strange that this sensational news

94
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,111
should come from a dead end!

95
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,633
Just my luck!

96
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:25,588
12... 14... 16...

97
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:28,557
Here it is. What a strange place.

98
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,991
- Wait here.
- OK.

99
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,433
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Hello, it's Mr Farazmand.

100
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,789
He might see you from the window.

101
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,347
Stay in the car till I call you.

102
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:07,951
Tell the plaintiff to bring
his complaint and his ID papers.

103
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,234
- Complaint and papers.
- Right.

104
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,796
Don't the police have their own vehicle?

105
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,078
Yes, they do.

106
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:32,310
The journalist will have quite a bill to pay.

107
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,709
- Smoke?
- No, thanks.

108
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:40,154
- Where are you from?
- Ispahan.

109
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,150
Funny... I'm from Tehran
and I did national service in Ispahan.

110
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,036
And you do the opposite!

111
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,269
That's fate!

112
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:59,830
- Are you from Ispahan too?
- No, Borujerd.

113
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,915
Actually I'm not from Ispahan,
but a village near Naeem.

114
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:12,277
- Naeem's near Yazd, right?
- Yes, my village is Jandagh.

115
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,795
- How long do you have left?
- I've done one year.

116
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,234
I still have two years to do,
because I'm not married.

117
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,828
I'm off to the front soon.

118
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:29,228
- Where?
- Kurdistan.

119
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,150
- Near Baneh?
- Yes.

120
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,032
It'll be over soon.
Then you can go home and get married!

121
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,918
As long as God grants you good health...

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,436
- And you?
- I'm married.

123
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,829
- Any children?
- Yes, one.

124
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,478
God bless him.

125
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,917
- Mr Abolfazl Ahankhah?
- Yes.

126
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,954
- Is he armed?
- I don't think so.

127
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,834
Hang on! I've forgotten my case.

128
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,271
Look, if you tell me the truth...

129
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,272
I can help you.

130
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,715
To you I'm just a crook.

131
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,710
Did he have one?

132
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,676
There's no one home.

133
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,833
But I really need a tape recorder.

134
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,559
Go to HQ. I'll see you there.

135
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,790
- What about the fare?
- How much is it?

136
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,154
350 tomans.

137
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,033
Mr Ahankhah, give me 200 tomans.

138
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,551
Sorry about this.

139
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,599
Here. I'll join you at HQ.

140
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,389
I have to find a tape recorder.

141
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,552
- We don't know them.
- I need one.

142
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,590
- <i>Yes?</i>
- It was a mistake!

143
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,708
They're away.

144
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,877
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Excuse me, I'm Mr Farazmand.

145
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,635
I'm a journalist and friend
of your neighbour, Mr Ahankhah.

146
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,678
I need a portable tape recorder.

147
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,876
<i>We don't have a recorder.</i>

148
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,393
Thanks anyway.

149
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,110
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Excuse me, I'm Mr Farazmand.

150
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,875
I'm a journalist and friend
of your neighbour, Mr Ahankhah.

151
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,116
- I need a tape recorder.
- <i>We don't have one.</i>

152
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,793
- You don't have one?
- <i>No.</i>

153
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,515
I'm Mr Farazmand...

154
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,356
- Mr Farazmand!
- Yes?

155
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,674
Here's one.

156
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,671
You'll get it back.

157
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,915

BOGUS MAKHMALBAF ARRESTED

166
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:39,635
- Who's in charge?
- Captain Bashiri.

167
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,870
- Can I see him?
- I'll call him.

168
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,474
Captain! Someone to see you.

169
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,029
- Hello, Captain.
- Hello.

170
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:59,477
I read in Sorush Magazine
that a certain Hossein Sabzian

171
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,028
was arrested by your men.

172
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,033
Yes, we have a copy of the magazine.

173
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,587
Do you want to see it?

174
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,797
Barati, bring me the magazine.

175
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,394
I already read the article,

176
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,189
but could you give me some more details?

177
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,149
I don't remember.
It was two weeks ago.

178
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,516
As you can see, we're very busy here.

179
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,558
Could you give me...

180
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,553
the address of the house
where it happened?

181
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,758
I'll have to check the file. Go get it.

182
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,917
- Two weeks ago?
- Yes.

183
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,797
It was published recently!

184
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,553
One week after it happened.

185
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,316
- Was he detained here?
- For a few days.

186
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,072
What kind of man is he?

187
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,508
He claimed to be quite religious.

188
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,194
Were you there when he was arrested?

189
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,507
Yes.

190
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:11,196
- Did he resist arrest?
- Not at all.

191
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,874
- What kind of man is he?
- He surrendered...

192
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,348
- Pardon me?
- He didn't struggle.

193
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:23,836
- What kind of man is he?
- Not the kind to do such things.

194
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,272
What do you mean?

195
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,911
He didn't look the kind who plans a fraud.

196
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,467
- Not the kind...
- Not at all.

197
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:37,514
I'd like Mr Ahankhah's address.

198
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,070
You seem to know a lot about it.
His house is...

199
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:43,911
I'll note it down.

200
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,072
Number 16, First Avenue
off Golzar Avenue in Lavizan.

201
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:55,947
Mr Kiarostami, the people
concerned by this case

202
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:01,159
wish to be presented in a favorable light.

203
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:06,836
Mr Farazmand claimed that the truth
would not have come out

204
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,750
if it hadn't been for him.

205
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,670
That's not true.

206
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:15,787
I knew exactly what was going on
and I always had the situation

207
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:18,234
perfectly under control.

208
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:24,189
I played along with him,
so it'd serve as a lesson to my children.

209
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,636
But you're giving me a different version

210
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:31,313
and I'm confused.

211
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,550
The report doesn't tell the whole story.

212
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,869
What do you mean by that?

213
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,311
The article portrays us as simple people.
That's not true.

214
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:43,798
What do you mean?

215
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:47,792
I like the movies, but that doesn't mean

216
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:50,996
I'd do what it says in the article.

217
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,470
I was glad my mother met Mr Makhmalbaf.

218
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,595
That's a fact.

219
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,716
I thought that meeting him

220
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,677
could've been useful to me, too.

221
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,637
I have a degree in civil engineering,

222
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:10,155
but I haven't yet found a job in my field.

223
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:12,230
And my brother,

224
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,312
who's a mechanical engineer, sells bread.

225
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:18,151
Mehrdad...

226
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:23,996
I had the choice
between art and selling bread.

227
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,035
I chose art.

228
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,474
<i>Manuchehr doesn't sell bread.</i>

229
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,916
<i>He's the director of a bread factory..</i>

230
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,787
<i>But Mom, come on...</i>

231
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:40,315
Could you speak Persian?

232
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:45,234
It's true, my brother didn't do
all those studies to sell bread.

233
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,588
When did you graduate?

234
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:49,907
Six months ago.

235
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:54,431
I'm sure you'll soon find a good job.

236
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,150
Amir, Hossein and Hushang
graduated over a year ago

237
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:04,471
and only Amir got a job for six months.

238
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,950
The factories aren't hiring.
They lack raw materials.

239
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,475
I came to talk about Mr Sabzian.

240
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,027
Can you tell me anything about him?

241
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,952
- Where is he now?
- In prison.

242
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,870
- Where?
- Ghasr.

243
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,071
- Hello. Mr Sabzian?
- Yes.

244
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,953
- Detained for?
- Attempted fraud.

245
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,910
You have a visitor.

246
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:48,557
- Are you well?
- Yes, thanks.

247
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:52,517
- Do you know me?
- Yes.

248
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:57,036
I read a report on you
and I decided to come see you.

249
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,793
- In what magazine?
- Sorush.

250
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,071
Apparently you're interested in cinema.

251
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,233
As I'm a filmmaker, I wanted to talk to you.

252
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,879
- And you are...
- Kiarostami.

253
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:18,790
I'm surprised, Mr Kiarostami.

254
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,958
I've seen your films.

255
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,874
Can I do anything for you?

256
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,708
You could make a film about my suffering.

257
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,349
I can't promise anything,
but I'd like to talk to you.

258
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:47,277
What did they write about me?
That I'm a crook?

259
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:53,187
Apparently you confessed
to attempted fraud.

260
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:57,519
Yes, I did confess.

261
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,594
- But I'm not a crook.
- Really?

262
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,638
Why did you confess you were, then?

263
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:15,874
Because what I did
looks like fraud from the outside.

264
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:22,068
- But what is it really?
- I'm interested in cinema.

265
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,034
How long have you been in prison?

266
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,717
I'm not sure.

267
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:45,236
- About three weeks.
- When's the trial?

268
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,877
I don't know.

269
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,917
The courts don't like this kind of case.

270
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,038
I'll try to bring your trial forward.

271
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,438
I'd be grateful.

272
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,509
I have no more questions, Captain.

273
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,073
I have a message for Mr Makhmalbaf.

274
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:13,227
What is it?

275
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,356
Tell him <i>The Cyclist</i> is a part of me.

276
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,512
I'll tell him.

277
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,712
If you'll excuse me...

278
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,751
Goodbye.

279
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,549
Goodbye. Tell me if you need anything.

280
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,828
- Which block are you in?
- Block 5.

281
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,149
- Nothing you need?
- No.

282
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:47,033
We came on Tuesday
concerning the Sabzian case.

283
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,837
I don't remember.

284
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,629
The man who pretended
to be Mr Makhmalbaf.

285
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:56,709
I have stacks of files.

286
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,271
I can't remember everyone's name...

287
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,795
Could you be more precise?

288
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:11,078
I came on Tuesday.
You said you'd speak to Haj Agha

289
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,151
and tell us his answer.

290
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,753
We'd like to film the trial.

291
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,070
That's right, I remember now.

292
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,115
I passed it on to Haj Agha.

293
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:38,517
Excuse me, did you study the Sabzian file?

294
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:43,358
- The one you want to film?
- Yes.

295
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,508
Yes.

296
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:49,714
We need your authorization
to shoot our film.

297
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:54,077
We'd like the date of the trial
to be brought forward.

298
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,153
It was set for January 19,
but we'd like it brought forward.

299
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:02,754
Yes, it was January 19.

300
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:06,791
Why do you want it brought forward?

301
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:09,154
What's the rush?

302
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:12,197
For our shooting schedule.

303
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:16,750
We also need a permit...

304
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:20,149
to film in the courtroom.

305
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:26,587
There's nothing about this case
that's worth filming.

306
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,270
- Did you study the file?
- Yes.

307
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,035
This case interests us,
because it has a connection...

308
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,030
with the cinema.

309
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,112
Do you have more interesting cases?

310
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:45,078
We have cases
where the charges are more serious.

311
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,834
This is a small fraud case

312
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:54,596
concerning the fact that he received
1,900 tomans from Mr Ahankhah

313
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,911
apparently to take a taxi.

314
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:03,470
He also passed himself off
as Mr Makhmalbaf.

315
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,074
Will you allow us
to film in the courtroom?

316
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,391
Only if the authorities allow it.

317
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:15,313
- That is?
- The Department of Justice.

318
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:17,674
If they OK it, I will.

319
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,398
- We have your agreement?
- You do.

320
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,509
Scene 1, Shot 1,
Law Courts, December 10.

321
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:05,233
Mr Sabzian, do you remember me?
We've met before.

322
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:08,397
Yes, Ghasr Prison.

323
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:10,470
We'd like to film the trial.

324
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,029
Do you agree to us doing that?

325
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,154
Yes.

326
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:19,588
Because you're my audience.

327
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,113
- Who is?
- You are.

328
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,757
Why's that?

329
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,399
- Because of my passion.
- Which passion?

330
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,312
Art.

331
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,912
Film.

332
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:34,435
We have two cameras,
one with a close-up lens.

333
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,272
- Know what a close-up is?
- Yes.

334
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,193
- The other camera...
- No, I don't know.

335
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,873
It's used to zoom in on things.

336
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:49,158
The other lens, a wide-angle,
films the proceedings.

337
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:53,278
This one stays on you all the time.

338
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,873
When I met you in prison,

339
00:27:55,959 --> 00:28:00,157
you told me you would plead guilty.

340
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,238
But certain things
are more complex than they seem.

341
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,472
This camera is here
so you can explain things

342
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:18,587
which people might
find it hard to understand.

343
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:22,592
They will begin by reading the charges.

344
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,113
If anything seems unacceptable to you

345
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,155
from a legal point of view

346
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:32,472
and you wish to explain,
address this camera.

347
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,787
OK.

348
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,870
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

349
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,075
In the name of God...

350
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,748
The accused, Mr Hossein Sabzian.

351
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:49,191
Who are the plaintiffs?

352
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:55,398
Mr Ahankhah, Mrs Mohseni
and Mehrdad Ahankhah.

353
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:59,113
- Three plaintiffs in all?
- Yes.

354
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:05,591
Before we proceed,
I invite the two parties

355
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,512
to settle their differences amicably.

356
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:15,071
If the plaintiffs do not wish

357
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,595
to withdraw their complaint,

358
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:22,558
we shall begin the trial.

359
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,197
As the head of the family,
I am not in a position

360
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,317
to withdraw my complaint.

361
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:40,350
I've asked my son Mehrdad
to talk on our behalf.

362
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:44,068
Very well. Let us begin.

363
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:52,232
Mr Ahankhah, could you give us
your side of the story?

364
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:57,314
Mr Hossein Sabzian
approached our family...

365
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,268
passing himself off as Mr Makhmalbaf...

366
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:05,078
and was clearly intending...

367
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,873
at best...

368
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,672
to commit fraud...

369
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:15,910
and at worst, a burglary.

370
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,835
He was thwarted...

371
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,751
thanks to my father's vigilance...

372
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,119
and was arrested.

373
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,437
THE CYCLIST

374
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,798
Excuse me, where did you get that book?

375
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:05,270
Where did you buy that book?

376
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,872
In a bookshop.

377
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,194
Could you give me the address?

378
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,712
You can have it.

379
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,438
No, thank you. I want to buy it.

380
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,747
It's yours.

381
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,989
I wrote it.

382
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,910
- You wrote it?
- Yes.

383
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,312
Are you Mr Makhmalbaf?

384
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:27,435
- Yes.
- Pleased to meet you.

385
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,715
That's very kind of you.

386
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,669
I'll sign it for you.

387
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,668
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

388
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,515
How come you use public transport
to get around?

389
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,794
Why does that surprise you?

390
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:23,872
Famous directors
usually use their own cars.

391
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,348
They don't take the bus.

392
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,837
I often take the bus

393
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,754
to look for interesting subjects.

394
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,318
Did you see my film?

395
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,108
Yes, with my children. I liked it a lot.

396
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:46,838
- Just once?
- Yes.

397
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,310
You have to see it several times
to fully understand it.

398
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:53,788
My children were more interested.

399
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,912
Really?

400
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:58,354
Yes, my two sons.

401
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:01,192
- They're engineers.
- Which was more interested?

402
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:04,789
The younger one was more enthusiastic.

403
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:08,235
- He saw it, too?
- Yes, we saw it together.

404
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,948
- What did he think about it?
- He liked it.

405
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,955
- Did he have any questions?
- No.

406
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,952
What does he do?

407
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,114
Both my sons are engineers.
The elder one's a mechanical engineer.

408
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:38,111
He works
in a bread factory in Mazandaran.

409
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:40,633
The younger one

410
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,834
doesn't have a job yet.

411
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,277
He helps out at a computing firm.
He studied civil engineering.

412
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,796
My daughter here just took
her university entrance exams.

413
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,113
Oh, she's your daughter, is she?

414
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:04,436
She has finished her schooling.

415
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,795
What are your son's interests?

416
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:13,192
He's interested in art and literature.

417
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:15,588
Has he written any screenplays?

418
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,670
Just for himself.

419
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:21,672
- He's interested in cinema?
- Yes, he is.

420
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:27,755
- And drawing?
- Yes, that's his specialty.

421
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,230
So he's interested in art?

422
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:33,547
Very much so.

423
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,955
My sons will be thrilled to hear

424
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,836
I met you.

425
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:43,433
If they wish, they can contact me.

426
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,271
What's your address?

427
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,351
It's on the back,
along with the phone number.

428
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,878
Thank you. I'll tell them.

429
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:57,668
Could I have your number?
Then, I could call them.

430
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,587
Here's some paper.

431
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,277
I have a pen, too.

432
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:13,271
- Here's your pen.
- Thanks.

433
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:17,149
What's your name?

434
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,638
Ahankhah.

435
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,358
Stop, I want to get off.

436
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,153
- You want to get off?
- Yes. Excuse me.

437
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:33,912
- I hope I'll see you again.
- Thank you.

438
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:43,588
What do you mean by "fraud"?

439
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,996
What exactly did he do?

440
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,070
Well, he passed himself off

441
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:52,310
as Mr Makhmalbaf, the filmmaker.

442
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:56,988
He examined all the rooms of the house,

443
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,233
pretending he wanted to film there,

444
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:08,956
so as to gather information
to carry out a burglary.

445
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,554
Mr Hossein Sabzian,
you are accused of fraud

446
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:23,073
and attempted fraud.

447
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:27,710
You are to defend yourself
on these two counts.

448
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:32,156
Do you acknowledge the charges
you are accused of?

449
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:38,508
If you do, explain how you intended
to carry them out.

450
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,794
The burglary...

451
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,439
You're not on trial for that.

452
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,910
You are accused
of fraud and attempted fraud.

453
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,628
I never intended to defraud anyone.

454
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:58,192
Legally, it might be
an acceptable charge.

455
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,870
But morally, it is not.

456
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,388
This all arose
from my love of the arts.

457
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:11,312
As a child, I often went to the cinema.

458
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:15,472
I played at making films with my friends.

459
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:18,232
But as I didn't have the means,

460
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,835
I had to abandon my artistic pretensions.

461
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:25,433
It became an obsession.

462
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,317
A crook, however,
deliberately changes his appearance.

463
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:37,951
He comes along in a borrowed car,
carrying a briefcase...

464
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,507
so he looks convincing.

465
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:43,067
I never did that.

466
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,956
That was not my intention.

467
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:51,230
What was your motive for passing
yourself off as Mr Makhmalbaf?

468
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,677
Tell the court.

469
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:57,229
I admire him, because he...

470
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:02,758
portrays suffering in his films.

471
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,831
In fact, he spoke out for people like me,

472
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,749
especially in <i>Marriage of the Blessed</i>.

473
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,468
Just like Mr Kiarostami
did in <i>The Traveller</i>.

474
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:18,030
I'm like the little boy in the film
who takes photos of people

475
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,792
although his camera isn't loaded,

476
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:26,556
so he can go to Tehran
to see a soccer match.

477
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,870
But he falls asleep and misses the match.

478
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:34,032
I too have the feeling I missed the match.

479
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,429
I know that my actions
can't be justified legally,

480
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,875
but my love of art
should be taken into account.

481
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:43,553
You haven't answered the question.

482
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:47,188
Why did you pass yourself off
as Mr Makhmalbaf

483
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:51,557
if you didn't intend to commit fraud?

484
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,994
Wouldn't you call that fraud?

485
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:59,677
I liked interpreting this character.

486
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:03,547
One of the plaintiffs
claims that the accused

487
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:06,107
received 1,900 tomans from him.

488
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:08,235
Tell us about that.

489
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,910
On leaving the house after his first visit,

490
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:16,467
he saw a motorbike.

491
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:22,429
He asked me if it belonged to me.

492
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:26,910
He asked me to give him a lift home.

493
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:34,111
So I agreed. As we left...

494
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:38,556
he said that if anything happened to him...

495
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,757
his admirers and his film crew...

496
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,593
would avenge him by coming to our house

497
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,988
and ransacking it.

498
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,148
We laughed at that.

499
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,231
As we rode along...

500
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:56,994
he answered me
as if he were Makhmalbaf.

501
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,038
He talked about his filmmaking.

502
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,236
I asked him a few questions.

503
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,073
He answered my questions

504
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,595
sometimes very intelligently,

505
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,467
sometimes very evasively.

506
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:22,319
I just thought that he didn't want

507
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:26,108
to expand on every aspect
of his filmmaking.

508
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:30,317
Then he said he'd had
an interesting idea for a film.

509
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:33,596
He said, "Two people are on a motorbike...

510
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,796
"and one loses his wallet."

511
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:41,475
I asked if that had happened to him

512
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,948
and he said yes.

513
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:47,952
As he got off, he said
he needed some money.

514
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,117
I thought that, to get home,

515
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,112
he'd need 50 or 100 tomans.

516
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:04,631
But he said that he needed to buy
something costing 1,500 tomans.

517
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,630
When I gave him the money,

518
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,155
he said he needed another 500,
that 2,000 would be perfect.

519
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,948
I kept 50 back...

520
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:19,716
because I needed some myself.

521
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:22,711
And I gave him the rest.

522
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:25,472
He put it in his pocket.

523
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:29,074
Then he said that the screenplay

524
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,357
that he had conceived finished like that...

525
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:36,830
One of the two men,
the one with some money,

526
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:40,548
lent some to the one
who had lost his money.

527
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,952
And it was the start of a great friendship.

528
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,152
I was delighted to have met a director

529
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:55,471
who was humble enough
to borrow money off me.

530
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:58,790
- Did you receive 1,900 tomans?
- Yes.

531
00:41:58,879 --> 00:42:01,757
Did you need the money or was it...

532
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,795
just to test his generosity?

533
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:05,551
I did need the money.

534
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:08,312
Does that justify your actions?

535
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,389
No.

536
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:14,758
With the court's permission,
tell us the reason for your behavior

537
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,469
and why you chose
to pass yourself off as Makhmalbaf.

538
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,349
Being Makhmalbaf was very difficult.

539
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:27,954
Why's that?
You yourself decided to be him.

540
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,916
It was hard for me...

541
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:35,032
to assume his identity.

542
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,989
It wasn't easy to be believable doing that.

543
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:45,309
- What?
- Being Makhmalbaf.

544
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:49,278
It was hard to play the part of a director.

545
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:54,398
But it gave me self-confidence.

546
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:01,752
And I won their respect.

547
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,832
- Whose respect?
- The members of the family.

548
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:11,472
They did everything I told them.

549
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:15,552
If I'd asked them, say, to move a cupboard,

550
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:18,836
or to cut down a tree,
they would have done it.

551
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:24,596
Before that, I'd never been able
to get my views across.

552
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:28,433
People were reluctant to do what I said.

553
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:32,751
But then, by acting like this famous person,

554
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:34,830
I made them all obey me.

555
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:40,118
When I left the house
and I had to accept the money

556
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:45,717
to buy something for my son

557
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:49,189
and pay for my trip home, I realized...

558
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:55,950
that I was still a poor guy
who couldn't even support his family

559
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:00,430
and who lived in a godforsaken place.

560
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:05,035
When I woke up the next day

561
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,078
and still had no job,

562
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:12,435
I understood nothing had changed.

563
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:16,831
It was hard to go on playing this part.

564
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:20,912
It was very hard
to pretend to be someone else.

565
00:44:20,999 --> 00:44:24,833
But at the same time, I liked it...

566
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:30,196
above all, because they respected me

567
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:34,397
and supported me morally.
So I really got into the part.

568
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:38,154
I started to believe I actually was a director.

569
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,948
I really felt it.

570
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:45,554
I wasn't acting any more.

571
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:51,509
I really became this new character.

572
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,797
But when I left that place

573
00:44:55,879 --> 00:44:59,633
and went home at the end of the day,

574
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:03,189
I had to shed my character
and that was hard for me.

575
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,634
Did the money make it easier

576
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:10,916
for you to go on playing this role?

577
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,713
Yes, a director cannot be poor.

578
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,029
He must have money.

579
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,477
He cannot be so poor

580
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,758
that he is unable

581
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:32,752
to give his family

582
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:35,751
the means to get by with dignity.

583
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,592
That's why it was so hard for me

584
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:44,197
to go on with my role as director
the next few days.

585
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:48,750
On the other hand, they trusted me

586
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:52,912
and their trust gave me confidence.

587
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:55,957
It gave you confidence
that he lent you money?

588
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:58,507
Yes, when he lent me money,

589
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,510
I realized

590
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,955
that he was convinced
that I was a director.

591
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:07,994
You didn't intend to give it back?

592
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,079
I did, but...

593
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:20,517
I didn't know how I could go about doing it.

594
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:25,477
On top of that...

595
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:30,235
he was so keen on acting in a film

596
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:35,712
that I would've loved
to have the means to make one.

597
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:41,317
We began to have doubts
the following Thursday.

598
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:44,835
He insisted we all go
see the film <i>The Cyclist</i>.

599
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:50,357
He said we could discuss the film,
that it'd serve

600
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:52,589
as a point of departure

601
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:56,592
for our film, <i>The House of the Spider</i>.

602
00:46:56,679 --> 00:47:01,389
<i>The Cyclist</i> was on at two cinemas.
One was near our house.

603
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:05,154
But he wanted us to go

604
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:09,630
to the one that was
a long way from our home.

605
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:12,756
He claimed that it was showing

606
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,478
a less censored version of the film,

607
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:18,790
so we had to see it in this cinema.

608
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:22,758
That's one of the things
that started us thinking.

609
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,548
When we pointed out
that we didn't have a car,

610
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:29,312
he said that it didn't matter.

611
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:32,038
He even asked a friend of ours

612
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,349
to take his father's car.

613
00:47:34,439 --> 00:47:38,796
He said that he wouldn't come with us.

614
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:43,794
Otherwise his admirers
would bother us outside the cinema.

615
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:47,718
Mr Sabzian, did you hear that?

616
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:50,108
Spite is a veil to conceal art.

617
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,268
What?

618
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,032
Spite is a veil to conceal art.

619
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,152
I should like to ask Mr Ahankhah...

620
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:05,235
who accuses me
of intent to burgle his house...

621
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,879
You are not accused of that.

622
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:12,350
He merely mentioned it in passing.
It's not on record.

623
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:14,589
So disregard that.

624
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:18,828
They claimed that you

625
00:48:18,919 --> 00:48:22,992
were part of a gang

626
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:26,310
who were planning a burglary.

627
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,960
I categorically deny that.

628
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,918
They thought you wanted
to force them out of their house

629
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:39,317
so your accomplices
could go in and steal their possessions.

630
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:43,312
- Was that your intention?
- No.

631
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:49,395
But you admit you wanted
to misappropriate Makhmalbaf's name.

632
00:48:49,479 --> 00:48:50,912
Yes.

633
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:55,231
As he has explained, and you confirmed,

634
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:58,629
he had no intent to steal anything.

635
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,394
But it isn't clear why he wanted

636
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:06,028
the whole family to go to the cinema.

637
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:09,156
If you don't mind, I'd like him to explain

638
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:11,958
his motives for doing this.

639
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:19,311
I wanted them to see the film

640
00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:22,038
so that they would acquire

641
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:25,589
a greater interest in the cinema

642
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:32,117
and have more respect for me as a director.

643
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,590
I wanted them to see me

644
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:39,477
as a director who is aware

645
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:45,152
of people's sufferings and difficulties.

646
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:52,198
A director who is modest enough

647
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:56,636
to mingle with ordinary folk.

648
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:02,191
I wanted to make them forget
the idea that a film director

649
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:05,271
is different from other people.

650
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:11,068
A director should have humility.

651
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:14,515
I wanted them to realize

652
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:17,671
that a true artist

653
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:21,468
is someone who is close to the people

654
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:25,234
and is prepared to go
to the cinema with them.

655
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:31,110
But as they didn't accept my proposition,

656
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,987
I suggest they go on their own.

657
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:39,550
I went there by bus

658
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:43,632
and when I arrived in front of the cinema,

659
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:47,314
I saw that they were already there.

660
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:49,867
They hadn't seen me...

661
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:53,076
I went up to them and I said...

662
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:57,516
that I'd been waiting
for them a long time.

663
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,069
They asked me how I'd come.

664
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:06,074
I told them I'd been careful
not to be recognized

665
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,152
because people
would have crowded round me

666
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,230
to ask for autographs.

667
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,234
What would you have done if someone
had taken you for Makhmalbaf?

668
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,230
If it had been outside the cinema,

669
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:28,597
I'd have tried not to attract attention,
but I sensed...

670
00:51:29,439 --> 00:51:32,397
Would you have followed him

671
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,710
and been his Makhmalbaf as well?

672
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,112
I think I would have.

673
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,998
How long after his visit
to your house was he arrested?

674
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:48,914
When he left us on the Tuesday,

675
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:52,230
he said he liked me

676
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,948
and that he wanted to give me the lead role

677
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,395
in his next film.

678
00:52:00,999 --> 00:52:04,878
He added that he'd be back to see us.

679
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:11,438
He said he'd come to lunch that Thursday.

680
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,388
And that soup was his favorite dish.

681
00:52:16,479 --> 00:52:20,791
How long after you met was he arrested?

682
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:23,029
And on what grounds?

683
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,914
He came to our house
three times in four days.

684
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:30,797
On the Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

685
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:35,748
Describe the circumstances
that led to his arrest.

686
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,115
Actually, my father
suspected him from the start.

687
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:45,594
He talked it over with Mr Mohseni.

688
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:48,318
The description he gave

689
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:51,072
corresponded to Mr Sabzian.

690
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:55,437
Mr Mohseni, you've been following
all this from the outset.

691
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,307
Everything has happened

692
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:04,234
as I anticipated it would.

693
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,038
But Mehrdad said

694
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,316
there was no reason to suspect him.

695
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:13,755
Fortunately, something happened yesterday

696
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,990
which convinced him
that he wasn't Makhmalbaf.

697
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,389
Yesterday, the so-called Makhmalbaf

698
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:24,233
came to rehearse with the children.

699
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,516
Mehrdad arrived with a newspaper.

700
00:53:28,759 --> 00:53:32,718
And he said,
"Congratulations, Mr Makhmalbaf!"

701
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,235
He was confused
and didn't know what to say.

702
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,629
The newspaper said that a prize

703
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:43,951
had been given to <i>The Cyclist</i>

704
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:46,473
at the Rimini Festival.

705
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,349
But he didn't seem
to know anything about it.

706
00:53:51,439 --> 00:53:53,031
He got out of it

707
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,637
by saying that this prize
was for the music of the film.

708
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:03,747
- He was thinking of Fajr Festival.
- Probably.

709
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,990
They continued their rehearsals.

710
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:13,030
But Mehrdad was convinced
that it wasn't Makhmalbaf.

711
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,837
But sometimes

712
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,038
the director doesn't hear
of these things right away.

713
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,475
No, the newspaper said Mr Makhmalbaf

714
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,553
had sent a wire to the festival.

715
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,427
So he had to know about the award.

716
00:54:32,879 --> 00:54:36,508
They continued the rehearsals,
then went to the cinema.

717
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,558
As we left the cinema,
he expressed the wish

718
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,837
to come home with us
and spend the night at our house.

719
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:48,548
He came home and spent the night here.

720
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:52,188
The next day, at around six am,

721
00:54:52,279 --> 00:54:56,397
I heard him talking with Mehrdad.

722
00:54:57,439 --> 00:54:59,589
He said he wanted to go...

723
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,795
mountain climbing.

724
00:55:02,879 --> 00:55:08,192
Mehrdad was sure he wouldn't come back.

725
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,752
But he lent him his coat
so he wouldn't catch cold.

726
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:18,071
We thought we'd never see him again,
but luckily...

727
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:22,949
or unluckily...
he phoned 30 minutes ago.

728
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:28,796
He asked Mehrdad to go to town
to pick him up.

729
00:55:28,879 --> 00:55:34,078
So off he went
and they'll be here any moment now.

730
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:36,195
Like I told you,

731
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:40,557
my friend knows artistic circles very well.

732
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,711
I hope this man really is Makhmalbaf.

733
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,552
Excuse me. I can hear a motorbike coming.

734
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:38,637
- Hello. How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

735
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:41,836
- My friend, Mr Mohseni.
- Pleased to meet you.

736
00:56:41,919 --> 00:56:43,716
Do sit down.

737
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,191
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

738
00:56:51,279 --> 00:56:54,157
I hope you had a good night's sleep.

739
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:55,752
I didn't.

740
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,558
- No?
- I didn't sleep at all.

741
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:03,235
I'm sorry you didn't find
our house comfortable.

742
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:08,672
One often sleeps badly
in someone else's place.

743
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:14,709
And yet a sage feels at home anywhere.

744
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:19,674
I'm no sage.

745
00:57:19,759 --> 00:57:22,876
You look like one though.

746
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:27,318
Appearances can be deceptive.

747
00:57:27,399 --> 00:57:30,391
Mr Makhmalbaf, have you eaten?

748
00:57:30,479 --> 00:57:33,073
I had a big breakfast.

749
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:37,152
But I'll gladly join you.

750
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,195
At the weekend, our children get up late

751
00:57:43,279 --> 00:57:45,839
and just have lunch.

752
00:57:45,919 --> 00:57:48,353
But I can make you an omelette.

753
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,034
No, I'm not really hungry.

754
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:58,388
Whether you're a sage or not,
all we can offer you is an omelette.

755
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:00,470
That's fine.

756
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,515
Make him an omelette.

757
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:11,716
Do you often go
up in the mountains, Mr Makhmalbaf?

758
00:58:11,799 --> 00:58:13,471
Sometimes.

759
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,997
But this morning,
when I looked at the mountains,

760
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:24,358
I felt the urge to get closer to nature.

761
00:58:24,439 --> 00:58:26,907
Being close to nature

762
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:31,515
lifts the burden of worries from your breast.

763
00:58:32,879 --> 00:58:37,316
One must be in touch with nature...

764
00:58:38,359 --> 00:58:41,749
"I asked the Muse why she was hiding.

765
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,149
"She replied, 'It's you who are hiding."'

766
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:50,553
We are the slaves of a mask
which hides our true face.

767
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:56,191
If we manage to free ourselves of this,
the beauty of truth will be ours.

768
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:01,070
This morning I wanted
to go up in the mountains to study myself.

769
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,312
Nature is a mirror
in which we can study ourselves.

770
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,394
If you like nature so much,
you should live a natural life.

771
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:19,518
Mehrdad, you don't look
as if you're ready for rehearsals.

772
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:21,916
I'm waiting for the others.

773
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:25,437
You're wasting my time.

774
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:27,555
Have your meal.

775
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,598
What do you see
as being unnatural about me?

776
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:33,796
That's not what I meant.

777
00:59:33,879 --> 00:59:41,991
I just wanted to stress
the fact that most people rest on a Friday.

778
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:47,756
When there's work to be done,
it doesn't matter what day it is.

779
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,557
We have so little time...

780
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:57,032
That's why I always give priority to my work.

781
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:04,070
Rest comes later.
You never know what tomorrow will bring.

782
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:10,075
You can't predict the future.
Even the immediate future.

783
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:17,270
That's why we must try to make the most
of the opportunities that come our way.

784
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,917
That's what I'm doing.

785
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:23,472
It's rare you get the opportunity to work.

786
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:26,437
You can't always choose when to rest.

787
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,594
That's why I don't stop working

788
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:35,467
on a Friday or during the summer.

789
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:40,679
I love my work and I have to finish it
before I can rest.

790
01:00:40,759 --> 01:00:44,308
There are so many days in the week

791
01:00:44,399 --> 01:00:46,674
when we are unable to work.

792
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:52,075
I'm prepared to work day and night

793
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:58,029
as long as your boys
maintain their enthusiasm.

794
01:00:58,879 --> 01:01:03,395
But I sense that their interest is fading.

795
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,950
I can't imagine why it is, though.

796
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,156
Mehrdad has done some very good work,

797
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:13,151
but he seems to be
becoming less motivated.

798
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,631
Who knows?

799
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,755
I'd like to know why.

800
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:24,230
If he had stayed
as keen as at the beginning...

801
01:01:25,439 --> 01:01:29,432
I'd have worked day and night.

802
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:31,951
It would've been no problem.

803
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:47,153
Yes? Come in.

804
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,317
- It's Mr Farazmand.
- Excuse me.

805
01:02:05,279 --> 01:02:08,112
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

806
01:02:09,999 --> 01:02:12,752
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

807
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:14,318
Not at all.

808
01:02:14,399 --> 01:02:17,391
- This is Mr Mohseni.
- How do you do?

809
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,155
- Mr Makhmalbaf.
- Pleased to meet you.

810
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,116
Please sit down.

811
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:28,434
How do you do, Mr Ahankhah?

812
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,914
I hope I'm not interrupting.

813
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:41,271
- Can I have a word?
- Of course.

814
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:16,867
Can we start the rehearsals?

815
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,950
I'll be right with you.

816
01:06:01,759 --> 01:06:04,956
Mr Ahankhah, I need a tape recorder.

817
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,758
Mr Farazmand needs a tape recorder.

818
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,593
- A portable tape recorder.
- We don't have one.

819
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:14,751
- What about your neighbors?
- I'll ask them.

820
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,994
Let him finish his meal.

821
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:25,316
- Don't let them take him away.
- Don't worry, he'll be back.

822
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:02,669
Is this your first offence of this kind?

823
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:06,030
Yes, it's the first.

824
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:10,994
- Yet I heard that...
- People take me for Makhmalbaf.

825
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:15,152
- So it's not the first time.
- People have taken me for him

826
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:18,229
and I did nothing to correct them.

827
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:21,667
Do you regret what you did?

828
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:27,877
Yes... I know that justice must be done.

829
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:31,872
But I regret having toyed with their feelings.

830
01:07:31,959 --> 01:07:35,395
That's the only reason I'm ashamed.

831
01:07:35,479 --> 01:07:40,758
Deep down, I never had the slightest
intention of stealing from them.

832
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:45,629
I'm sorry for what I did,
but not for the time I spent in prison.

833
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:49,951
Prison is good for good people
and bad for the wicked.

834
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:56,677
It teaches good people a lesson
but the wicked get worse. I repent.

835
01:07:56,759 --> 01:07:59,114
- Been to prison before?
- Never.

836
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:02,794
- What is your trade?
- I worked for a printer.

837
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:07,077
Why did you search every room

838
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:09,389
in their house?

839
01:08:09,479 --> 01:08:13,870
I was playing the part of a director.

840
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:18,669
I said that we'd do the shot
from such and such an angle...

841
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:21,353
Have you ever worked in film?

842
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:22,758
No.

843
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:26,115
But I've read books on the subject.

844
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:30,670
Screenplays
and books about how to direct films.

845
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:35,594
I went through the motions
of rehearsing scenes.

846
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:41,197
You also asked them
to cut the trees in the garden.

847
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,592
I said that for the scenes
we'd shoot in the garden,

848
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:50,753
the trees would obscure
the view of the house

849
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:54,752
and Mr Ahankhah agreed to cut them down.

850
01:08:54,839 --> 01:09:00,835
Then, I said that we could use other angles.

851
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:04,753
Was the idea of filming in the house

852
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:08,070
yours or theirs?

853
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:10,673
Mine, but they liked the idea, too.

854
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:15,231
Did you intend to ask them
for money for the production?

855
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:17,628
- To produce the film?
- Yes.

856
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:21,473
I put forward a project to them.

857
01:09:21,559 --> 01:09:25,950
If I'd had the money, I would have shot it.

858
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:29,873
They seemed to want to get involved

859
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:32,519
in a film project.

860
01:09:32,599 --> 01:09:37,514
I never thought
it would turn out the way it did.

861
01:09:38,559 --> 01:09:41,027
He repents of his faults.

862
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:43,872
I wish to ask the plaintiffs

863
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:47,631
if they would agree to pardoning him.

864
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:51,678
Of course, his offence is punishable by law.

865
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:57,391
But their pardon could be considered
as extenuating circumstances.

866
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:02,678
I would have pardoned him
if he had been honest.

867
01:10:02,759 --> 01:10:07,469
But when I hear him,
I get the impression he is still acting.

868
01:10:07,559 --> 01:10:10,198
He's still playing a role,

869
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:13,635
even if it's a slightly different one.

870
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:16,187
Instead of playing Makhmalbaf,

871
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:19,237
he is playing a sentimental person.

872
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:24,598
I'd like Mr Farazmand to tell us

873
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:29,707
about the various people
who contacted him about this man.

874
01:10:29,799 --> 01:10:32,359
Do you have new evidence?

875
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:36,148
Yes, I do. I've been following the case.

876
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,117
What is the title of the article you wrote?

877
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,588
"Bogus Makhmalbaf Arrested."

878
01:10:41,678 --> 01:10:43,396
Bogus Makhmalbaf?

879
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:48,792
When the paper came out,
I received a lot of phone calls.

880
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:56,151
One of them was from a woman
I haven't been able to find since.

881
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:01,749
She said that a man
who claimed to be Makhmalbaf

882
01:11:01,839 --> 01:11:05,957
had promised to give her a part in his film.

883
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:11,318
He had even promised to marry her.

884
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:16,598
She wanted to file a complaint and I told her

885
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:21,515
she should come to the trial to tell her story.

886
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,555
But she refused.

887
01:11:23,639 --> 01:11:27,951
I also got a call from a printer's

888
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:33,909
saying that the accused
had misappropriated funds,

889
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:39,551
such as keeping the money
from a delivery of paper.

890
01:11:39,639 --> 01:11:41,311
Well, Mr Sabzian...

891
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:46,348
Concerning the lady's phone call...

892
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:49,317
Since you're single now, you could've...

893
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:54,075
I deny everything
and I am prepared to confront her.

894
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,869
I worked as a salesman

895
01:11:58,959 --> 01:12:01,632
for a trading company.

896
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:05,507
I'd call on clients

897
01:12:05,599 --> 01:12:08,909
and show them my samples.

898
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:15,238
The day I met Mrs Ahankhah

899
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:18,755
I was short of money

900
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:24,038
and I'd left home without eating any lunch.

901
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,999
When Mrs Ahankhah
took me for Makhmalbaf,

902
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:32,630
I thought that I could perhaps go

903
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:37,031
and have lunch at her house.

904
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,189
I only did it to have a meal.

905
01:12:40,519 --> 01:12:43,272
I would like to add...

906
01:12:44,599 --> 01:12:46,669
an important fact.

907
01:12:46,759 --> 01:12:50,718
On the day I was arrested,

908
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:54,917
I had written Mr Ahankhah's address

909
01:12:54,999 --> 01:12:59,311
in my notebook and I wrote next to it

910
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:02,391
"The Last Tragedy".

911
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:04,913
- You knew...
- I sensed it.

912
01:13:04,999 --> 01:13:08,674
I sensed the end was coming
and I wrote it down.

913
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:13,355
My tragic end.
I'm sure they read it at Police HQ.

914
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:17,352
I knew that I'd be arrested
because of the money

915
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:22,274
that I'd received
and because I'd spent the night there.

916
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:26,796
But I couldn't stop myself

917
01:13:26,879 --> 01:13:30,030
going back to that house.

918
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,396
- Why?
- I loved playing that part.

919
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:36,755
I enjoyed playing the part of Makhmalbaf

920
01:13:36,839 --> 01:13:40,149
and arousing their respect and admiration.

921
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,436
It did my morale a lot of good.

922
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:49,388
I also thought they'd give me
some financial support.

923
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:53,870
But that day when he came
to pick me up on his motorbike,

924
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:56,598
I felt ill at ease.

925
01:13:56,679 --> 01:14:00,911
But I decided to go with him nevertheless.

926
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:06,027
As I arrived that last day,
I knew I'd be arrested.

927
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:11,240
When I phoned Mehrdad
to fix an appointment with him

928
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:17,876
at Hosseinabad Square,
I knew it was a trap.

929
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:23,158
When Mehrdad arrived at the square,
he was astonished to see

930
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:29,075
that I was waiting for him,
which confirmed my suspicions.

931
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:33,756
I made a note of it and they read it

932
01:14:33,839 --> 01:14:36,148
at Police HQ.

933
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:39,914
- Where is this notebook?
- I tore out the page.

934
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:44,390
I tore it out,
because I thought it was all over.

935
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:49,712
When did you realize
your pretence had been discovered?

936
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,950
On the last day.
During the evening I spent with them,

937
01:14:56,039 --> 01:15:00,749
I saw a film magazine lying around.

938
01:15:00,839 --> 01:15:04,752
Inside was a photo of Makhmalbaf.

939
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:08,229
He was directing one of his actresses

940
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,948
in a scene from <i>Marriage of the Blessed</i>.

941
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:16,510
I sensed that they had bought
this film magazine,

942
01:15:16,599 --> 01:15:20,353
because there was this photo in it.

943
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:23,909
They wanted to see how I'd react.

944
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:25,955
They showed me the photo

945
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:30,988
and said to me,
"You were more handsome

946
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:34,196
"when you were young, Mr Makhmalbaf".

947
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:37,908
I said to them that I was much younger then.

948
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:42,515
At that moment, I sensed
that they were suspicious.

949
01:15:42,599 --> 01:15:46,831
But I soon convinced myself

950
01:15:46,919 --> 01:15:51,356
that they didn't know I wasn't Makhmalbaf.

951
01:15:54,599 --> 01:15:56,954
How far did you want to take this?

952
01:16:04,839 --> 01:16:06,909
As far as they were...

953
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:10,992
prepared to go.

954
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:15,430
When he came
to our house on the Thursday,

955
01:16:15,519 --> 01:16:18,397
he had grey hair.

956
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,870
But on the photo,
Makhmalbaf's hair was black.

957
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:27,032
I didn't ask him why, but he said that his hair

958
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:33,592
had once been black and it was now grey.

959
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:39,197
When he returned that Saturday,
he had dyed his hair.

960
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:41,952
How does he explain that?

961
01:16:42,039 --> 01:16:44,712
My mother, who is right here,

962
01:16:44,799 --> 01:16:47,518
can confirm that I dyed my hair

963
01:16:47,599 --> 01:16:52,195
a long time
before this whole episode began.

964
01:16:53,839 --> 01:16:57,798
I wanted to look a bit younger.

965
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:00,755
You are young.

966
01:17:00,839 --> 01:17:04,149
I've been dyeing my hair for a long time,

967
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:08,232
and it wasn't for the reason
that was suggested here.

968
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:11,197
- Are you married?
- Yes.

969
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:14,351
- You have a family?
- I'm divorced.

970
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:15,872
Why is that?

971
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:18,871
I was poor and out of work.

972
01:17:18,959 --> 01:17:21,154
- Any children?
- Two.

973
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:24,868
- Where are they?
- I have one, my wife the other.

974
01:17:24,959 --> 01:17:28,190
- Who looks after him?
- My mother.

975
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:31,271
- Where is your mother?
- Right here.

976
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:34,829
- Where?
- At the back, wearing a black veil.

977
01:17:34,919 --> 01:17:38,150
- Are you Mr Sabzian's mother?
- Yes.

978
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,788
Do you know why he divorced his wife?

979
01:17:42,919 --> 01:17:46,798
- Why?
- He works for a printer off and on.

980
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:51,907
He's often out of work.
Our house is small. After he married,

981
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:56,390
they got a room of their own.

982
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:00,518
After seven years,
his wife started complaining

983
01:18:00,599 --> 01:18:04,877
that there was no future
for her in our house.

984
01:18:04,959 --> 01:18:09,908
He said that if she wasn't happy,

985
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:13,196
the best thing would be to divorce.

986
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:16,988
They agreed
she'd keep one child and me the other.

987
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:21,516
He lives with me. When he has work,

988
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,673
he supports his family as best he can.

989
01:18:25,759 --> 01:18:28,831
He's never been in trouble before.

990
01:18:28,919 --> 01:18:32,389
Why didn't you try to get bail for him?

991
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:35,835
I went to see the officer in charge.

992
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:40,709
I also asked to see Mr Ahankhah.
But they said they'd handle it.

993
01:18:41,639 --> 01:18:45,109
Every time I feel sad in prison,

994
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:52,160
I think of the verse
in the Koran which says,

995
01:18:52,239 --> 01:19:02,149
"To remember God is
the best consolation for a troubled heart".

996
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:07,472
I feel the need, when I'm depressed
or overcome by worries,

997
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:11,757
to express the anguish in my soul,

998
01:19:11,839 --> 01:19:14,034
all my sorrows

999
01:19:15,759 --> 01:19:20,514
that no one wants to hear about.

1000
01:19:20,599 --> 01:19:25,719
And then, I come across a good man

1001
01:19:25,799 --> 01:19:29,394
who portrays all my sufferings

1002
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:33,028
in his films, and makes me want

1003
01:19:33,999 --> 01:19:37,708
to see them over and over again.

1004
01:19:37,799 --> 01:19:40,791
A man with the courage to portray people

1005
01:19:40,879 --> 01:19:43,347
who play with others' lives,

1006
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:46,954
the rich who are indifferent
to the needs of the poor...

1007
01:19:48,839 --> 01:19:51,956
simple needs which are mainly material.

1008
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:59,229
That's why this book
brought me consolation.

1009
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,074
It speaks of things
I'd have liked to express myself.

1010
01:20:03,959 --> 01:20:08,987
Now, having played this part, do you think

1011
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:13,470
you are a better actor than a director?

1012
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,675
It's not for me to say.

1013
01:20:17,839 --> 01:20:20,478
I think I prefer being an actor.

1014
01:20:20,559 --> 01:20:23,676
I think I could express

1015
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:26,947
all the bad experiences I've had

1016
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:31,829
and all the suffering
I have felt deep down inside me.

1017
01:20:31,919 --> 01:20:35,116
I like to think that I could

1018
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:37,952
get these feelings across

1019
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:40,678
through my acting.

1020
01:20:40,759 --> 01:20:44,069
Are you not acting
for the camera right now?

1021
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:48,077
What are you doing now?

1022
01:20:49,239 --> 01:20:51,116
I'm speaking of my suffering.

1023
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:54,395
That's not acting.

1024
01:20:55,479 --> 01:20:57,515
I'm speaking from the heart.

1025
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:01,871
For me, art...

1026
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:07,078
is the extension of what you feel inside.

1027
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:09,036
Tolstoy said,

1028
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:12,395
"Art is a sentimental experience

1029
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:17,792
"that the artist develops in himself
and shares with others".

1030
01:21:17,879 --> 01:21:20,598
I think that my experiences of hardship

1031
01:21:20,679 --> 01:21:24,957
and suffering can give me
the grounding I need

1032
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:28,509
to be a good actor.

1033
01:21:28,599 --> 01:21:32,877
That way I act well and I express

1034
01:21:33,759 --> 01:21:36,353
my inner reality.

1035
01:21:40,759 --> 01:21:45,753
Why did you pretend to be a director,
rather than become an actor?

1036
01:21:51,519 --> 01:21:57,116
Playing the part of a director
is a performance in itself.

1037
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:02,349
T o me, that's acting.

1038
01:22:03,959 --> 01:22:07,998
- What part would you like to play?
- My own.

1039
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:10,309
You are playing your own part.

1040
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:20,312
Mr Sabzian, you have heard

1041
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:22,754
the charges against you.

1042
01:22:22,839 --> 01:22:25,672
Say whatever you think
might help your case.

1043
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:30,428
I ask Mr Ahankhah's honorable family
to forgive me.

1044
01:22:31,759 --> 01:22:35,752
I'm not asking
to be spared the sentence I deserve.

1045
01:22:35,839 --> 01:22:38,478
I need their pardon

1046
01:22:38,559 --> 01:22:41,312
to soothe my conscience.

1047
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:44,835
I ask the court to forgive me
if that is possible.

1048
01:22:44,919 --> 01:22:48,389
Do you promise never to do it again?

1049
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:50,470
I promise.

1050
01:22:50,559 --> 01:22:51,912
The accused...

1051
01:22:51,999 --> 01:22:54,559
Please forgive him.

1052
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,072
Sit down.

1053
01:22:56,159 --> 01:23:00,710
My son is a descendant of the Prophet.
For his sake...

1054
01:23:00,799 --> 01:23:02,551
please forgive him.

1055
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:07,031
In view of his young age,

1056
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:13,274
the fact that he has a family to support,

1057
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:16,954
that he has no record,

1058
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:21,271
and that he promises never to do it again,

1059
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:24,829
I would ask the plaintiffs
to forgive him if they can.

1060
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:29,673
But as I said before,

1061
01:23:29,759 --> 01:23:35,994
their pardon could only be considered
as extenuating circumstances.

1062
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:37,990
Is this the case?

1063
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:40,593
I am willing

1064
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:44,513
to withdraw my complaint
in the hope that Mr Sabzian

1065
01:23:44,599 --> 01:23:47,238
may become a useful member of society.

1066
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:52,153
Now I know he regrets what he did,

1067
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:56,517
if my son Mehrdad is in agreement,

1068
01:23:56,599 --> 01:23:58,829
I will withdraw my complaint.

1069
01:24:03,799 --> 01:24:07,030
His actions are the result

1070
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:10,031
of the social malaise and unemployment.

1071
01:24:10,119 --> 01:24:12,952
But this is not the place to debate that.

1072
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:17,157
He is therefore not the only one to blame.

1073
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,516
Unemployment can lead to delinquency.

1074
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:24,597
I am certain, after he has been freed,

1075
01:24:24,679 --> 01:24:30,470
if he finds a proper job,
he will lead an honest life.

1076
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:36,429
That's why I too withdraw my complaint.

1077
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,391
We've lost him!

1078
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:48,913
He didn't wait in the right spot.

1079
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:50,717
I can't see him.

1080
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:54,075
We can't redo this shot!

1081
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:57,594
- I can see him.
- Yes, he's behind the taxi.

1082
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:59,874
- I see him.
- Me, too.

1083
01:24:59,959 --> 01:25:01,312
We've no sound!

1084
01:25:02,799 --> 01:25:05,154
What on earth's going on?

1085
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:09,596
It comes from Mr Makhmalbaf's lapel mike.

1086
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,988
It's old equipment.

1087
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:13,990
There's a loose wire in it.

1088
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:15,910
It's 15 years old.

1089
01:25:15,999 --> 01:25:17,910
The sound's back!

1090
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:22,235
Will it last long?

1091
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:23,718
We can't do anything.

1092
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,510
Are you Mr Sabzian?

1093
01:25:28,559 --> 01:25:30,550
How are you?

1094
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,197
Don't cry.

1095
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:36,948
There's no need to cry.

1096
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:39,428
When were you released?

1097
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:41,752
Let me look at you.

1098
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:51,914
When were you released? Look at me.

1099
01:25:53,678 --> 01:25:55,270
Let's go.

1100
01:25:56,919 --> 01:25:58,432
This way.

1101
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:00,832
You OK?

1102
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:03,678
- Where are you going?
- The Ahankhahs'.

1103
01:26:03,759 --> 01:26:05,158
I'll take you.

1104
01:26:05,239 --> 01:26:07,036
Had you seen me before?

1105
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:09,587
- In the film.
- Which film?

1106
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,829
<i>Marriage of the Blessed</i>.

1107
01:26:11,919 --> 01:26:14,991
Do you prefer
being Makhmalbaf or Sabzian?

1108
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:19,270
I'm tired of being me.

1109
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:26,435
I'll get the motorbike.

1110
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:30,758
Hold that for me.

1111
01:27:05,919 --> 01:27:07,557
How long were you in prison?

1112
01:27:13,839 --> 01:27:16,876
When you met that woman in the bus...

1113
01:27:26,519 --> 01:27:27,713
In your opinion...

1114
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,195
That's very true.

1115
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:34,549
Now I see what that means.

1116
01:27:56,879 --> 01:27:59,188
Do you want to buy some flowers?

1117
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:00,758
Count your money.

1118
01:28:02,799 --> 01:28:05,154
Be careful with your money.

1119
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:11,512
Here, take this.

1120
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:24,031
Not yellow ones.

1121
01:28:24,119 --> 01:28:26,189
Pick a different color.

1122
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,516
Red's better.

1123
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:13,833

- <i>Hello. Come in.</i>
- Hello.

1128
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,354
What's the date, Hossein?

1129
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:50,393
The 3rd.

1130
01:30:51,999 --> 01:30:54,035
When did you come here first?

1131
01:30:54,119 --> 01:30:55,268
40 days ago.

1132
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:07,789

01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:15,633
Please forgive me, Mr Sabzian.

1135
01:31:17,879 --> 01:31:23,590
Mr Sabzian has changed.
Please see him in a new light.

1136
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:28,150
I hope he'll be good now
and make us proud of him.
