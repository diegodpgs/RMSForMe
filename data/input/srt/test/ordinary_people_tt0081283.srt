Well. Regionally.

I think he moved to Skokie.

Leave it on the table
in the hallway.

345
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,440
Are you having fun?

346
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:42,780
Fun?

347
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:46,380
There's no point
if you're not having fun.

348
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:48,391
Yeah. I guess so.

349
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:49,858
You guess so.

350
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:54,420
Are you on medication?

351
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:55,897
Tranquilizers?

352
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,194
Anything?

353
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:59,792
No. No. Sir.

354
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,464
Did I ask you
if they gave you shock?

355
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:04,029
Yeah.

356
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:05,632
Yeah what?

357
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,540
Yeah. You asked me.

358
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:09,044
Yeah. They did.

359
00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:13,215
Don't look at us. Lazenby.

360
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:15,217
Get in the water!

361
00:22:20,124 --> 00:22:23,457
I'm no doctor. Jarrett.

362
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:27,258
I wouldn't let them
put electricity in my head.

363
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:31,300
He drives me nuts!

364
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:34,030
Everybody drives you nuts.

365
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,274
Don and Fenetch looked good.

366
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:40,207
They looked very good.

367
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:43,212
Is he giving you a hard time?

368
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,214
Want a clarinet?

369
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,216
Van Buren wants a clarinet.

370
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,717
Who's selling it?

371
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:50,720
My brother.
He needs a motorcycle.

372
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:53,256
You stand behind me
in the choir.

373
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:55,917
Oh. I do?
Is that you?

374
00:22:55,993 --> 00:22:58,359
You have a lot of energy.

375
00:22:58,429 --> 00:22:59,453
I do?

376
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,259
I mean. That's good.

377
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:03,265
My name's Jeannine Pratt.

378
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,766
Nice. Hi.

379
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:06,268
You're Conrad Jarrett.

380
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:07,496
Right.

381
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:11,265
Yeah. Um. Bye.

382
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:12,774
Bye-bye.

383
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:16,779
"You've got a lot of energy."

384
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:21,776
[Children]
Trick or treat!

385
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:25,288
You're the scariest
ghost I've ever seen!

386
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:26,788
You look wonderful.

387
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:28,791
Thank you.

388
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:29,791
There you go.

389
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,293
Be careful.

390
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,295
Thank you.
Good-bye.

391
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:36,798
The Cabots.
Julie's first time.

392
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:38,801
She's so cute!

393
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:43,197
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

394
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:46,470
Know what I've been thinking?

395
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:48,477
That Christmas in London...

396
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:51,981
would be like something
out of Dickens.

397
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:54,483
We've never done that before.

398
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:58,988
Maybe we shouldn't plan
to go away right now.

399
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:00,990
We talked about it.

400
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:02,992
We decided on that.

401
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,994
Yeah. I know that.

402
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:07,997
But the timing
doesn't seem right.

403
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:11,000
We've always gone away
at Christmas.

404
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:13,730
It'd be good for him. Too.

405
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:16,238
Let's get back to normal.

406
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:19,002
He's just started
with this doctor.

407
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:21,010
He'll miss three weeks.

408
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:22,511
Why interrupt it?

409
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:25,514
Because I want to get away.

410
00:24:25,582 --> 00:24:28,517
I think we should.
It's important.

411
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:33,022
Not if he doesn't
go through with this now.

412
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,524
He might change his mind.

413
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:38,026
If he changes his mind...

414
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:40,290
it wasn't right for him.

415
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:42,628
Does he want to go?

416
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:45,634
He doesn't know what he wants.

417
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:54,592
Ahh!

418
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:56,360
Don't do that!

419
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:57,866
I'm sorry.

420
00:26:57,935 --> 00:27:00,870
I didn't think you were here.

421
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:02,872
I just got in.

422
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,874
No golf today.
Too cold.

423
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:06,375
How was golf?

424
00:27:06,443 --> 00:27:07,876
I didn't play.

425
00:27:07,945 --> 00:27:09,378
It's colder today.

426
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:12,882
I mean. For the year.
It's colder.

427
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:15,517
Weren't you swimming?

428
00:27:15,585 --> 00:27:18,019
Yeah. Sorry I scared you.

429
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:19,521
How'd it go?

430
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:21,523
Good. I swam well.

431
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:22,523
Good.

432
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:26,028
I could swim the 50 if my...

433
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:28,030
my timing got better.

434
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:30,032
I'm a little off.

435
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,534
You must work at that.

436
00:27:32,602 --> 00:27:33,534
Yeah.

437
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:37,641
I got 74 on a Trig quiz.

438
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:39,173
74?

439
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:42,177
Gee. I was awful at Trig.

440
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,678
Oh. Yeah? Did you...

441
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,908
You took Trig?

442
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:49,845
Wait a minute.

443
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,813
Did I take Trig?

444
00:27:57,494 --> 00:28:01,157
I bought you two shirts.
They're on your bed.

445
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,765
Who'll be there?

446
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:10,863
Well. The Murrays.
The Gunthers. And the Caines.

447
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,738
Let's go to the movies instead.

448
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,472
Don't be negative.

449
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:18,878
That's not negative.
That's unpredictable.

450
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,280
Let's go to the movies.

451
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,750
Okay.

452
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:24,377
Really?

453
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,218
Okay. Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.

454
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,723
What's our excuse?

455
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:33,559
Beth wanted to go
to the movies.

456
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,722
Good.

457
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,322
Very good.

458
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,839
All right now. Smile.

459
00:28:43,907 --> 00:28:46,774
Remember. Not too many martinis.

460
00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:54,850
Will you put that
with the others?

461
00:28:54,918 --> 00:28:56,852
Look. We're in time.

462
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,353
Look who's here!

463
00:28:58,421 --> 00:29:02,357
Three blocks away
and the last to arrive.

464
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:03,858
Come on in.

465
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:06,361
Happy birthday!
You look wonderful.

466
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:07,862
Is that new?

467
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:10,866
Yes. It is.
Do you like it?

468
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:13,300
You did the mousse?

469
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:14,666
It turned out well?

470
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:17,298
Hey. Partner.
How are you?

471
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:19,034
Hi there.

472
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,009
Hi. Beth.

473
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:22,601
Good to see you.

474
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,010
Borrow the money.

475
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,513
I'll go public.

476
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:29,678
I wouldn't do it now
because the market's low.

477
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:31,516
Your hair looks wonderful.

478
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:34,113
It's shorter. You like it?

479
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,785
I said.
"Please put out your cigar."

480
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:41,661
He says. "Huh?
I don't have another one."

481
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,300
Good to see you!

482
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,632
You look beautiful. As ever.

483
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,137
In school...

484
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:54,302
they think they've got
to walk on the edge of danger.

485
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,470
What are these hushed tones?

486
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,605
He told the funniest joke!

487
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,284
I'm not talking to you.

488
00:30:03,353 --> 00:30:04,650
Why?

489
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:08,418
I have my fingers crossed
on this merger.

490
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:09,651
Let's have lunch.

491
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,990
I don't know my schedule.

492
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,325
I'm free most days.

493
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,991
Bob McLean's leaving
Coles and Johnson.

494
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,000
Where is he going?

495
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,036
He doesn't know.

496
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:22,332
Jesus.

497
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:23,872
No. You didn't.

498
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,273
Isn't he the meanest man
you've met?

499
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,641
When a ball is in play.

500
00:30:29,712 --> 00:30:33,671
If a player or caddy
accidentally move it...

501
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,877
#Jolly good fellow #

502
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:38,420
# For he's a jolly good fellow ##

503
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:43,686
# Won't regret. Can't forget #

504
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,092
# What we did #

505
00:30:46,162 --> 00:30:48,687
# For #

506
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:53,532
# Love ##

507
00:30:57,207 --> 00:31:00,370
Hi. Annie. What's your boy up to?

508
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:01,876
Oh. Who knows?

509
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:03,708
How's Conrad doing?

510
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,714
He's great. Just great.

511
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,980
I asked Donald.
He says they haven't talked much.

512
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:12,715
I said maybe he's self-conscious.

513
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:13,721
Oh!

514
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,720
No. No. No.

515
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,730
No. He's...

516
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,325
There's a doctor
in Highland Park...

517
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:27,733
that he sees twice a week.

518
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,068
He's great. Just great.

519
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:33,302
Is he still having some problems?

520
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,241
No. Nothing like that.

521
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,745
Just somebody to talk to...

522
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,180
to polish off the rough edges.

523
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,808
How are you. Darling?

524
00:31:41,885 --> 00:31:44,319
Is he falling asleep on you?

525
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:46,116
Nah. He's great.

526
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,187
[Mimicking "Mr. Wonderful"]
# Mr. Great. That's me #

527
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:55,196
Hey.

528
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,993
You drank too much.

529
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:00,501
I'm not drunk.

530
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,165
Why did you tell Annie
about Conrad's psychiatrist?

531
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,673
Why not?

532
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:08,836
People don't hear
that thing easily.

533
00:32:08,912 --> 00:32:12,348
For most people.
It's a status symbol.

534
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:14,849
Well. Your blurting it out...

535
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:16,852
was a violation of privacy.

536
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,353
Whose privacy?

537
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,252
The family's privacy!

538
00:32:20,323 --> 00:32:23,258
I think it is
a very private matter.

539
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,264
I tell you my dreams?

540
00:32:33,336 --> 00:32:35,770
I don't believe in dreams.

541
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:39,296
What kind of
a psychiatrist are you?

542
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,775
What's happening?

543
00:32:42,912 --> 00:32:44,209
What's going on?

544
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,214
I just feel...

545
00:32:46,282 --> 00:32:48,273
I feel so...

546
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,318
What?

547
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,184
Jumpy. I don't know.

548
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:54,746
Look. Kiddo...

549
00:32:55,825 --> 00:32:57,417
I lied.

550
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:00,428
I believe in dreams.

551
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:04,432
Sometimes I want to know
what's happening when you're awake.

552
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,832
Something's making you nervous.

553
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,371
Maybe I need a tranquilizer.

554
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:10,531
Tranquilizer?

555
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:12,904
What do you think?

556
00:33:12,976 --> 00:33:16,434
You look like something
out of The Body Snatchers.

557
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:19,777
It's not my impression
that you need a tranquilizer.

558
00:33:21,684 --> 00:33:23,311
What is this?

559
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:25,115
A clock.

560
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:28,624
You can tell the time.
But I can't.

561
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:31,819
So you know when
the hour's up?

562
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:33,156
Right.

563
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:34,856
50. 55 minutes?

564
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,375
Maybe I don't want
to swim anymore.

565
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,877
My timing is for shit.

566
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:53,382
Two guys better than me
swim the 50.

567
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,384
They're a bunch of boring jocks.

568
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,421
And him...
I can't stand him.

569
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:01,252
Thought about quitting?

570
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:02,313
You telling me to?

571
00:34:02,392 --> 00:34:03,916
Nope.

572
00:34:03,993 --> 00:34:06,120
It wouldn't look good.

573
00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:07,560
How does it feel?

574
00:34:09,832 --> 00:34:12,596
How does it feel?

575
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:15,068
Yes.
How does it feel?

576
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:20,370
It's the same damn thing
I did last year.

577
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:23,173
Are you the same
person now?

578
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:26,306
That's why you need
a tranquilizer?

579
00:34:26,382 --> 00:34:27,440
You're a doctor.

580
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:30,782
I'm supposed to
feel better. Right?

581
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:32,377
Not necessarily.

582
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:42,288
Is it getting any easier
with your friends?

583
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:44,390
No. It's still hard.

584
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:46,401
Is anyplace easy?

585
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:51,633
The hospital was.

586
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,504
It was? Why?

587
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,875
Because nobody
hid anything there.

588
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:02,611
Was there anyone there
you could talk to?

589
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:03,743
Uh-huh.

590
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,288
I mean, beside Dr. Crawford?

591
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:07,788
Uh-huh.

592
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:16,397
Whoa!

593
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:17,990
Hi.

594
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:18,999
Karen!

595
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:20,501
How are you?

596
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,662
Good.

597
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:23,170
Sit down. Please.

598
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,298
Thank you.

599
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,706
Wow.

600
00:35:54,137 --> 00:35:56,571
When did you get back?

601
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,574
The end of August.

602
00:35:58,642 --> 00:35:59,574
Good.

603
00:35:59,643 --> 00:36:01,577
It's great to see you.

604
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:03,613
Oh. You. Too.

605
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,081
Listen. I've got a meeting
over at the school.

606
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,583
Drama Club meeting.

607
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:11,086
We're doing
A Thousand Clowns.

608
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:12,587
You know it?

609
00:36:12,656 --> 00:36:16,285
Anyway. We're going crazy
getting it together.

610
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:18,589
Don't let me hang you up.

611
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:22,325
No. I wanted to see you.

612
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:25,334
I didn't know what to expect.

613
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:28,337
You sounded funny on the phone.

614
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:31,340
It was just a gray day.

615
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:34,400
Everything's great.
I'm on the swim team.

616
00:36:34,478 --> 00:36:36,070
Oh. You're swimming?

617
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:38,171
Terrific. Conrad.

618
00:36:38,248 --> 00:36:39,772
That's really wonderful.

619
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,250
I could be benched all year.

620
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:44,651
You'll do great.

621
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:49,055
I'll bet your folks
are real proud of you.

622
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,057
Yeah.

623
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,390
What can I get you?

624
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:53,895
Are you hungry?

625
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:55,397
Just a coke.

626
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,831
Two cokes. Please.

627
00:36:57,901 --> 00:36:59,698
Did we offend him?

628
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:00,895
Something I said?

629
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:05,138
A low self-image day.

630
00:37:07,244 --> 00:37:08,734
So. Uh...

631
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:10,074
- Are you...
- What did...

632
00:37:12,682 --> 00:37:16,118
I can't believe
how beautiful you look.

633
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:18,518
You really look beautiful.

634
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:20,852
So do you.

635
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:22,551
Do you miss it?

636
00:37:22,626 --> 00:37:23,786
Miss what?

637
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,054
The hospital.

638
00:37:25,128 --> 00:37:27,119
No.

639
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:28,892
Thank you.

640
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:30,694
You don't miss it?

641
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:31,893
No.

642
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:34,664
You don't miss Leo's corny jokes?

643
00:37:38,808 --> 00:37:40,366
Are you seeing a doctor?

644
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:43,344
Yeah. I'm seeing one. Are you?

645
00:37:43,413 --> 00:37:46,507
Uh. Dr. Crawford gave me a name.

646
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:49,017
I went for a while.

647
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:51,019
It didn't work.

648
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:54,523
He told me the things
I already knew.

649
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:56,024
Finally. I decided...

650
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:59,152
the only one who
can help me is myself.

651
00:38:01,298 --> 00:38:04,995
At least. That's what
my dad says.

652
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:07,696
If it's something
you want to do.

653
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:10,535
That's what you
should be doing.

654
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:14,373
I don't know
how long I'll keep it up.

655
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:18,942
Your hair grew in.

656
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:23,349
Oh. That was such
a dumb thing to do.

657
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,047
I like it.

658
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:26,554
You do?

659
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:28,022
Yeah.

660
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:32,560
I don't know.
I just...

661
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:34,563
I miss it sometimes.

662
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:36,064
The hospital.

663
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:37,793
I really do.

664
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:42,637
Things have to change. You know?

665
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:44,936
But that's where we laughed.

666
00:38:45,008 --> 00:38:47,306
But that was a hospital.

667
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:50,869
This is the real world.

668
00:38:50,947 --> 00:38:52,812
I guess you're right.

669
00:39:00,056 --> 00:39:02,547
I really have to go.

670
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:03,888
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,327
I have a meeting at the school.

672
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:09,831
We're doing A Thousand Clowns.

673
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:11,833
You told me.

674
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,470
Did I?

675
00:39:15,538 --> 00:39:17,836
Yeah.

676
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:19,340
I better hurry.

677
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:21,843
Don't want to be late.

678
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:26,515
Thanks for seeing me.

679
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:29,850
Conrad?

680
00:39:31,054 --> 00:39:33,420
Let's have a great Christmas.

681
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:37,892
Okay?

682

a great year.

Let's have the best year
of our lives.

685
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,766
This could be
the best year ever.

00:40:00,183 --> 00:40:01,115
Yeah.

00:40:01,184 --> 00:40:02,617
You mean it?

692
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:03,618
Yep.

693
00:40:06,022 --> 00:40:07,614

700
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:02,911
It's cold.

701
00:41:05,482 --> 00:41:07,416
You should put that on.

702
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:09,418
Do you want a sweater?

703
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:10,783
Do I need one?

704
00:41:16,993 --> 00:41:18,927

705
00:41:18,995 --> 00:41:20,428
Nothing.

707
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:25,732
About what?

708
00:41:25,802 --> 00:41:27,235
Not about anything.

709
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,235
Your hair is starting to grow out.

710
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,244
It's looking... looking better.

711
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:45,020
I was thinking
about the pigeon...

712
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,522
that hung around the garage.

713
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:52,357
How it used to get
on top of your car.

714
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:53,918
Oh. Yeah.
I remember.

715
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:58,524
I remember
how scared I got...

716
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:00,535
That wsssshhhhh!
Flap. Flap. Flap...

717
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:03,538
Every time I started the car.

718
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:08,703
That was the closest
we came to having a pet.

719
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:13,215
Buck tried to talk you
into getting a dog.

720
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:17,720
He said. "If it's the size
of a football?"

721
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:20,722
You know.
That animal next door...

722
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,781
that Pepper or Pippin...

723
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,656
Pippin. Pippin. Pippin.

724
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:26,490
He's not friendly...

725
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:29,031
whatever Mr. McGreary says.

726
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:31,191
He wanted the retriever.

727
00:42:31,267 --> 00:42:34,134
Each time that dog comes here.
I try to get him out.

728
00:42:34,204 --> 00:42:35,330
Arf!

729
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:36,929
Arf! Arf!

730
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:43,777
Put that on
if you're staying out here.

731
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:24,912
Can I help?

732
00:43:24,988 --> 00:43:26,421
With this?

733
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:28,582
No.

734
00:43:28,658 --> 00:43:29,682
I will.

735
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:32,523
You can go to your room...

736
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:34,460
and clean the closet.

737
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,430
Mom.

738
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:38,524
Okay?

739
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:41,365
Because it's really a mess.

Oh. Hi.

I didn't get there.

No. I'm not doing anything.

Mary Ann Ramon started
just to scream. Right?

752
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,974
We got so drunk.
We couldn't talk.

753
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:24,239
It was the last day of school.

No. Stop!

We just don't connect.

That I jack off a lot.

763

So what else is new?

00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,016

He didn't
know what to say.

773
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:39,052
He put his
arm around me.

774
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,987
We just sat there.

775
00:45:42,057 --> 00:45:43,991
I remember watching his shoe.
And thinking...

776
00:45:47,562 --> 00:45:50,497
His shoe was turned
over on its side.

777
00:45:50,565 --> 00:45:54,865
I was thinking. He's so uptight!
It's gonna crack off.

778
00:45:57,873 --> 00:46:00,205
I knew I should've
felt something.

I didn't know what to feel.

On TV. They say stuff
like. "Oh. No!"

But I didn't say that...

782
00:46:10,585 --> 00:46:13,520
because I didn't feel sad...

So much as what?

00:46:22,097 --> 00:46:25,032
I kept thinking John-Boy
would've said something...

about how he felt.

787

I don't know
what else to do.

853
00:50:30,645 --> 00:50:33,079
I'm not asking for anything.

854
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:34,581
You're kidding me.

855
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:37,083
I don't get it.

856
00:50:37,152 --> 00:50:39,086
You're excused from practice...

857
00:50:39,154 --> 00:50:41,019
to see some shrink;

858
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:44,525
I work with you
at your convenience.

859
00:50:44,592 --> 00:50:46,924
What more should I do?

860
00:50:46,995 --> 00:50:49,020
Nothing.

861
00:50:49,097 --> 00:50:51,930
A bright kid like you.

862
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,968
I don't get it.

863
00:50:54,035 --> 00:50:57,004
Why keep messing up your life?

864
00:50:57,071 --> 00:51:00,370
I don't think that
quitting swimming...

865
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:02,966
will mess up my life.

866
00:51:08,116 --> 00:51:09,947
Okay.

867
00:51:10,018 --> 00:51:13,249
Okay. Now. This is it.

868
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,413
Yeah.

869
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,286
You're a big kid.

870
00:51:16,357 --> 00:51:18,222
Actions have consequences.

871
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:20,454
I'm not taking you back.

872
00:51:20,528 --> 00:51:21,927
I won't ask you to.

873
00:51:32,073 --> 00:51:34,007
[Laughing]

874
00:51:45,086 --> 00:51:47,020
What happened?
You all right?

875
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:48,385
Yeah.

876
00:51:48,456 --> 00:51:50,014
You quit the swim team.

877
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:51,524
Yeah.

878
00:51:51,593 --> 00:51:53,026
Why?

879
00:51:53,094 --> 00:51:54,527
It was a bore.

880
00:51:54,596 --> 00:51:57,531
That's no reason!

881
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,032
What's going on?

882
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,533
Nothing.

883
00:52:00,602 --> 00:52:02,035
Talk to me.

884
00:52:02,103 --> 00:52:04,037
Swimming's a bore. That's all.

885
00:52:04,105 --> 00:52:05,037
I talked to...

886
00:52:05,106 --> 00:52:06,869
Quit talking to people!

887
00:52:06,942 --> 00:52:08,534
Okay?

888
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,544
Holy shit.

889
00:52:10,612 --> 00:52:12,546
Yeah. Sure.

890
00:52:12,614 --> 00:52:14,548
Fuck you. Jarrett.

891
00:52:14,616 --> 00:52:16,550
Ooh! Ohh!

892
00:52:16,618 --> 00:52:18,051
Shut up.

893
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,553
Leave it alone.

894
00:52:20,622 --> 00:52:23,557
I told you. The guy's a flake.

895
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:31,490
- What did your dad say?
- I haven't told him.

896
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,124
How come?

897
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:35,294
The timing isn't right.

898
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,894
He sweats everything.

899
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:39,065
He'll just get worried.

900
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,074
Can you tell your mother?

901
00:52:41,142 --> 00:52:42,507
My mother?

902
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:45,011
I told you we don't connect.

903
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,516
What do people have
in common with mothers anyway?

904
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,016
It's all surface junk.

905
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:51,518
You know?

906
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,520
"Clean your room.
Brush your teeth...

907
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,112
get good grades."

908
00:52:56,925 --> 00:52:59,553
I'm not feeling anything today.

909
00:52:59,628 --> 00:53:01,152
I'm sorry.

910
00:53:01,229 --> 00:53:02,787
No. Sorry's out.

911
00:53:02,864 --> 00:53:04,957
Something's on your mind.

912
00:53:05,033 --> 00:53:06,523
What time is it?

913
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,034
Never mind. There's time.

914
00:53:09,337 --> 00:53:11,430
Remember the contract?
Control?

915
00:53:11,506 --> 00:53:13,565
Maybe there's some connection...

916
00:53:13,642 --> 00:53:16,805
between control
and lack of feeling.

917
00:53:16,878 --> 00:53:18,812
I said I feel things.

918
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,040
When?

919
00:53:20,115 --> 00:53:21,548
Come on.

920
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,550
When?

921
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,280
Sometimes. I don't know.

922
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:30,051
I thought you didn't
like fooling around.

923
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,820
What do you want?

924
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:34,691
Don't say. "I don't know."

925
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:37,231
Should I make up answers?

926
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:40,358
Make one up about
there's no feelings there.

927
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:41,868
I have feelings.

928
00:53:41,936 --> 00:53:43,494
Get it together. Jarrett.

929
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:46,734
You're trying to make me mad.

930
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:48,241
Are you mad?

931
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,004
No!

932
00:53:50,078 --> 00:53:52,012
You don't like being pushed.

933
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,513
Do something about it!

934
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:54,513
What?

935
00:53:54,582 --> 00:53:56,516
No. I can't do this.

936
00:53:56,584 --> 00:53:58,279
Why not?

937
00:53:58,353 --> 00:54:00,048
Getting mad takes too much energy.

938
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:02,521
It takes more holding it back.

939
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:06,048
When I let myself feel.
I feel lousy.

940
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:09,062
# I never promised you
a rose garden #

941
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:10,392
Fuck you. Berger.

942
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:11,932
Fuck you.

943
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,932
Yeah?

944
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:14,696
That's it.

945
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:17,670
What do you feel?
Do you jack off?

946
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:19,707
What do you think?

947
00:54:19,774 --> 00:54:22,038
You married a fat lady...

948
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,544
and you fuck
the daylights out of her!

949
00:54:24,612 --> 00:54:26,204
Sounds good to me.

950
00:54:40,095 --> 00:54:42,154
Little advice
about feeling...

951
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,664
Don't expect it always to tickle.

952
00:54:47,736 --> 00:54:50,364
Do you know how
to aim that?

953
00:54:50,438 --> 00:54:53,168
Be quiet. I have to concentrate.

954
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:54,708
Be quiet.

955
00:54:54,776 --> 00:54:56,744
Is it in focus?

956
00:54:56,811 --> 00:54:58,779
Smile. Smile.
Okay. Good.

957
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:02,840
I want to take
the three young ones.

958
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:05,385
Dad. Get out of there.

959
00:55:05,453 --> 00:55:06,750
All right.

960
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:08,288
Connie.

961
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:09,823
Be quiet.

962
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:11,859
Conrad. Where are you?

963
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:14,394
Between your mother and father.

964
00:55:14,462 --> 00:55:17,431
You're taller than
your mother is!

965
00:55:17,499 --> 00:55:19,899
Will you be quiet?

966
00:55:19,968 --> 00:55:21,333
This is beautiful.

967
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,029
Shut up.

968
00:55:23,104 --> 00:55:24,571
Wonderful.

969
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:26,607
Now Cal and Beth.

970
00:55:26,674 --> 00:55:27,641
Sure.

971
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:29,574
Go on.

972
00:55:29,644 --> 00:55:32,772
You can do better than that.

973
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:36,044
I want one of Connie and Beth.

974
00:55:36,117 --> 00:55:39,609
Let's get the three men in there.

975
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:42,178
Move closer to your mother.

976
00:55:42,257 --> 00:55:43,189
Prize winner.

977
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:45,055
Yeah. That's great.

978
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:46,491
Do it.

979
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:47,994
Isn't it marvelous?

980
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:49,495
Yes. It is.

981
00:55:49,564 --> 00:55:51,464
It isn't cocked.

982
00:55:51,533 --> 00:55:52,932
Calvin.

983
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:55,196
Hold it. Connie. Smile.

984
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,067
Calvin!

985
00:55:57,138 --> 00:55:58,332
Smile.

986
00:55:58,406 --> 00:56:00,499
Give me the camera.

987
00:56:00,575 --> 00:56:02,065
Give me the camera.

988
00:56:02,143 --> 00:56:05,306
I want a really good picture.

989
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,713
I want a shot of you three men.

990
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:11,775
Not until I get you two.

991
00:56:11,853 --> 00:56:14,515
Give her
the goddamn camera!

992
00:56:30,905 --> 00:56:32,930
Smile.

993
00:56:36,878 --> 00:56:39,870
Who's hungry?
I'll make the sandwiches.

994
00:56:44,419 --> 00:56:46,319
[Crash]

995
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:54,294
Beth!

996
00:56:55,396 --> 00:56:57,364
It can be saved.

997
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:03,026
That was so dumb.

998
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:10,203
I don't think
he's happy in school.

999
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:15,315
Have you talked to his teachers?

1000
00:57:15,383 --> 00:57:18,443
People don't want
to be with him.

1001
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:19,986
He provokes people.

1002
00:57:20,054 --> 00:57:22,545
Well. It's an awkward age.

1003
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:24,091
Thank you.

1004
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:27,684
Maybe he needs a change.

1005
00:57:27,762 --> 00:57:29,753
Is he eating enough?

1006
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:31,696
Yes. Mother.

1007
00:57:31,766 --> 00:57:33,734
He'll be all right.

1008
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:36,235
If you're firm with him.

1009
00:57:36,304 --> 00:57:40,240
I think he should
go away to school.

1010
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:42,742
I can't deal with him.

1011
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:44,971
Who'd make that decision?

1012
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:49,244
I suppose this doctor he's seeing.

1013
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:51,478
What sort of doctor...

1014
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,884
would make that decision for you?

1015
00:57:53,955 --> 00:57:55,388
A psychiatrist.

1016
00:57:55,456 --> 00:57:57,890
I thought that was finished.

1017
00:57:57,959 --> 00:57:59,483
No.

1018
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,494
What's his name?

1019
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,496
Berger.

1020
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:05,498
Jewish doctor?

1021
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,500
I suppose he's Jewish.

1022
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:10,002
Maybe just German.

1023
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:13,006
What does Cal say
about all this?

1024
00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:16,509
This can be saved.

1025
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:19,273
It's a nice clean break.

1026
00:58:19,347 --> 00:58:22,612
# Amen. Amen. Alleluia #

1027
00:58:22,684 --> 00:58:25,152
# Amen #

1028
00:58:25,219 --> 00:58:32,455
# Amen ##

1029
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:33,960
Okay.

1030
00:58:34,028 --> 00:58:37,464
That last "E" natural
could be higher.

1031
00:58:37,532 --> 00:58:40,433
Officers. Don't forget
your meeting tonight.

1032
00:58:46,207 --> 00:58:47,640
# Mmm mm mmm #

1033
00:58:47,709 --> 00:58:49,700
# Mmm mm mmm #

1034
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:51,472
# Mmm mmm #

1035
00:58:51,546 --> 00:58:53,309
# Mmm mm mmm #

1036
00:59:00,688 --> 00:59:02,121
Hi. Jeannine.

1037
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:04,681
You're really a terrific tenor.

1038
00:59:04,759 --> 00:59:08,251
In fact. You should be
doing the solo.

1039
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:10,297
No. L...

1040
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:11,832
No. I'm serious.

1041
00:59:11,899 --> 00:59:13,366
You sing well.

1042
00:59:13,434 --> 00:59:16,426
I'm getting to know your voice.

1043
00:59:16,504 --> 00:59:19,996
How can you hear me
if you're singing?

1044
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:21,541
Well...

1045
00:59:21,609 --> 00:59:23,577
I don't always sing.

1046
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,635
Sometimes I just listen.

1047
00:59:25,713 --> 00:59:29,706
For instance. Marcia Blair
can't sing a note.

1048
00:59:29,784 --> 00:59:33,743
Janet Fox mouths the words
and never sings.

1049
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:35,345
A detective.

1050
00:59:35,423 --> 00:59:36,947
[Jeannine]
Do you like Vivaldi?

1051
00:59:37,025 --> 00:59:39,459
Telemann?

1052
00:59:39,527 --> 00:59:41,119
[Conrad]
Telemann? Um...

1053
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:44,198
What kind of music do you like?

1054
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,593
Oh. Uh...

1055
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,668
Modern jazz. I like.

1056
00:59:48,735 --> 00:59:52,193
Folk rock. Spoon on a glass.

1057
00:59:52,272 --> 00:59:55,264
Spoon on a glass?

1058
01:00:00,247 --> 01:00:03,739
Oh. You mean.
Like. Table spoons?

1059
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:06,786
Oh. Dear.

1060
01:00:08,889 --> 01:00:11,858
Why do I ask dumb questions?

1061
01:00:11,925 --> 01:00:13,893
I'm just showing off.

1062
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,000
Why is it so hard...

1063
01:00:21,068 --> 01:00:24,003
the first time you talk
to somebody?

1064
01:00:24,071 --> 01:00:26,005
You make it look easy.

1065
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:30,176
Really?

1066
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:36,012
That's my bus.
I got to go.

1067
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:38,051
I'll see you later!

1068
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:42,020
You're really a terrific tenor.

1069
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,855
# Ah. You're
just saying that #

1070
01:00:55,669 --> 01:00:57,500
# Alleluia #

1071
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,768
# Alleluia #

1072
01:01:01,842 --> 01:01:03,742
# Alleluia #

1073
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:05,801
# Alleluia #

1074
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:08,143
# Ah ha ha ha

1075
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:12,345
# Ha ha ha ha

1076
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:14,250
# Alleluia. Alleluia #

1077
01:01:14,321 --> 01:01:15,948
# Alleluia #

01:01:16,023 --> 01:01:18,150

# Alleluia ##

1083
01:01:42,582 --> 01:01:43,947
Hello.

1084
01:01:44,017 --> 01:01:45,484
Is Karen there?

1085
01:01:45,552 --> 01:01:47,019
Who's calling?

1086
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:50,056
A friend of hers from Hillsboro.

1087
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,750
Oh.

1088
01:01:51,825 --> 01:01:54,794
She's not home from school yet.

1089
01:01:54,861 --> 01:01:56,488
Oh. Um...

1090
01:01:56,563 --> 01:01:59,031
Hmm. Tell her I called.

1091
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:00,566
This is Conrad.

1092
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,102
Tell her I'm feeling great...

1093
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:06,162
and I wanted to talk to her.

1094
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:07,672
Yes. I will.

1095
01:02:07,741 --> 01:02:08,765
Thank you.

1096
01:02:49,917 --> 01:02:52,385
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1097
01:02:52,453 --> 01:02:55,616
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1098
01:03:04,164 --> 01:03:07,224
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Conrad.

1099
01:03:07,301 --> 01:03:08,996
Conrad.

1100
01:03:09,069 --> 01:03:10,400
Conrad?

1101
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:12,268
What a dumb name.

1102
01:03:12,339 --> 01:03:16,105
Hello. Jeannine.
This is Bill.

1103
01:03:16,176 --> 01:03:17,438
Uuuuugh!

1104
01:03:22,616 --> 01:03:24,083
Hello.

1105
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:26,551
Hello. This is...

1106
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,554
Hello. This is Conrad calling.

1107
01:03:28,622 --> 01:03:30,055
Jarrett.

1108
01:03:30,124 --> 01:03:31,489
Oh.

1109
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,492
Oh. Hi!

1110
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,993
Listen. I was...

1111
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:37,997
I was wondering
if maybe you'd like...

1112
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:39,498
to go out sometime.

1113
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:41,500
Like on a date?

1114
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:45,004
We wouldn't have
to call it a date.

1115
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:47,506
We could see how it goes.

1116
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:51,510
That was dumb.
Now start over.

1117
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,011
This is Conrad Jarrett.

1118
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,809
I'd love to. When?

1119
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:31,012
I didn't see you.

1120
01:04:31,084 --> 01:04:32,847
What do you think?

1121
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,182
Fine.

1122
01:04:34,254 --> 01:04:37,052
Rawlins used to have
great scotch pines.

1123
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:40,821
They look like
skeletons this year.

1124
01:04:40,894 --> 01:04:43,385
Hi. What do you think?

1125
01:04:45,566 --> 01:04:47,830
It's very nice.

1126
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:50,802
What is wrong?

1127
01:04:50,871 --> 01:04:52,304
Ask him what's wrong.

1128
01:04:52,372 --> 01:04:56,103
Maybe you won't have to
hear it from Carol Lazenby.

1129
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:57,575
Hear what?

1130
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:03,749
I quit the swim team.

1131
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,978
Carol thought I knew.

1132
01:05:06,053 --> 01:05:09,022
It happened over a month ago.

1133
01:05:09,089 --> 01:05:10,488
Quit? When?

1134
01:05:11,558 --> 01:05:14,220
Where have you been every night?

1135
01:05:14,294 --> 01:05:16,228
Nowhere.
The library mostly.

1136
01:05:16,296 --> 01:05:19,026
I didn't think it mattered.

1137
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:21,533
That was meant for me.

1138
01:05:21,602 --> 01:05:24,833
It's important to hurt me. Right?

1139
01:05:24,905 --> 01:05:26,805
You have that backwards.

1140
01:05:26,874 --> 01:05:30,833
Do I embarrass you
in front of friends?

1141
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:34,904
"Poor Beth believes
every lie her son tells."

1142
01:05:34,982 --> 01:05:36,472
I didn't lie.

1143
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:40,577
You did when
you came home at 6:30!

1144
01:05:40,654 --> 01:05:44,715
If the lying's starting again.
I can't stand it!

1145
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:47,055
Then go to Europe!

1146
01:05:47,127 --> 01:05:52,497
She only gives a fuck because
someone else knew about it first!

1147
01:05:52,566 --> 01:05:55,899
She never came
to the hospital...

1148
01:05:55,969 --> 01:05:59,496
because she's busy going
to goddamn Spain and Portugal!

1149
01:05:59,573 --> 01:06:04,067
She doesn't care if I'm hung up
by the balls out there.

1150
01:06:04,144 --> 01:06:06,942
They may talk like this
at the hospital...

1151
01:06:07,014 --> 01:06:09,539
but we're not at the hospital.

1152
01:06:09,616 --> 01:06:12,050
You never came to the hospital!

1153
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,815
She had the flu
and couldn't come inside.

1154
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,857
She would've visited Buck
in the hospital!

1155
01:06:17,925 --> 01:06:20,826
Buck never would've been
in the hospital!

1156
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,555
That is enough!

1157
01:06:22,629 --> 01:06:25,359
I won't do it again.

1158
01:06:25,432 --> 01:06:28,026
What in hell has happened?

1159
01:06:28,101 --> 01:06:30,626
Somebody better go up there.

1160
01:06:30,704 --> 01:06:33,070
He walks all over us...

1161
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:36,303
then you apologize to him.

1162
01:06:36,376 --> 01:06:38,105
You've been apologizing to him...

1163
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:41,272
since he returned from the hospital!

1164
01:06:41,348 --> 01:06:44,806
I'm trying to
goddamn understand him!

1165
01:06:44,885 --> 01:06:46,512
Don't talk to me...

1166
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,146
the way he talks to you.

1167
01:06:49,222 --> 01:06:51,690
Let's not fight. Okay?

1168
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,316
No fighting. Okay?

1169
01:06:53,393 --> 01:06:55,293
Please.

1170
01:06:55,362 --> 01:06:56,989
Let's go upstairs.

1171
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,516
I want to talk to you.

1172
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:21,145
I didn't mean any of it.

1173
01:07:21,221 --> 01:07:23,416
Please don't be mad.

1174
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:26,357
I'm trying to
understand what happened.

1175
01:07:26,426 --> 01:07:28,917
I don't know what happened.

1176
01:07:28,996 --> 01:07:30,930
I didn't mean it.

1177
01:07:30,998 --> 01:07:34,161
Tell her I'm sorry. Will you?

1178
01:07:34,234 --> 01:07:35,326
Why don't you?

1179
01:07:35,402 --> 01:07:37,165
God. I can't!

1180
01:07:37,237 --> 01:07:39,705
I can't talk to her!

1181
01:07:39,773 --> 01:07:41,240
Why not?

1182
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:43,299
It doesn't change anything.

1183
01:07:43,377 --> 01:07:47,905
It doesn't change
the way she looks at me.

1184
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:52,008
She was hurt because
you quit the team.

1185
01:07:52,085 --> 01:07:54,553
I don't mean just now.

1186
01:07:54,621 --> 01:07:57,112
I don't mean just today.

1187
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,181
Explain it to me.

1188
01:07:59,259 --> 01:08:02,251
I can't. You don't see things.

1189
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,796
What things?

1190
01:08:03,864 --> 01:08:05,491
What things?

1191
01:08:05,565 --> 01:08:08,557
I want you to tell me.

1192
01:08:08,635 --> 01:08:11,729
Can't you see she hates me?

1193
01:08:11,805 --> 01:08:13,705
She doesn't hate you.

1194
01:08:13,774 --> 01:08:16,299
You're right.
She doesn't.

1195
01:08:16,376 --> 01:08:18,367
Please leave me alone.

1196
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:34,649
Do you think Dr. Berger's helping you?

1197
01:08:34,728 --> 01:08:36,593
It's not his fault.

1198
01:08:42,736 --> 01:08:45,705
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

1199
01:08:50,143 --> 01:08:54,136
Tuesday everything was hunky-dory.

1200
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,647
You're the doctor.

1201
01:08:58,652 --> 01:09:01,587
Don't take refuge
in one-liners. Okay?

1202
01:09:01,655 --> 01:09:03,589
Because that pisses me off.

1203
01:09:03,657 --> 01:09:06,091
Okay. Okay.

1204
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:07,592
Everything was fine...

1205
01:09:07,661 --> 01:09:10,596
till you had the fight
with your mother?

1206
01:09:10,664 --> 01:09:12,097
I don't blame her.

1207
01:09:12,165 --> 01:09:14,599
She's got her reasons.
It's impossible...

1208
01:09:14,668 --> 01:09:16,602
after all the shit I've pulled.

1209
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:18,604
What shit have you pulled?

1210
01:09:21,174 --> 01:09:23,540
I'm talking about proportion.

1211
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:25,510
Now. What shit?

1212
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:32,541
You can find one example.

1213
01:09:32,619 --> 01:09:34,553
Don't say you tried suicide.

1214
01:09:34,621 --> 01:09:36,555
What have you done lately?

1215
01:09:36,623 --> 01:09:40,252
I'll never be forgiven for that.

1216
01:09:40,327 --> 01:09:41,817
Never.

1217
01:09:41,895 --> 01:09:45,991
You can't get out
the blood in her towels...

1218
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:48,091
and in her rug.

1219
01:09:48,168 --> 01:09:50,693
Everything
had to be pitched.

1220
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:54,365
The bathroom tile
had to be regrouted.

1221
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,170
She fired the maid...

1222
01:09:56,243 --> 01:09:59,076
because she couldn't dust right.

1223
01:09:59,146 --> 01:10:01,671
If you think I'll forgive...

1224
01:10:01,748 --> 01:10:03,238
she's gonna forgive me...

1225
01:10:11,258 --> 01:10:12,418
What?

1226
01:10:32,512 --> 01:10:36,278
I think I just figured
something out.

1227
01:10:36,349 --> 01:10:37,816
What?

1228
01:10:39,419 --> 01:10:41,853
Who it is who can't forgive who.

1229
01:10:47,127 --> 01:10:50,563
[Berger]
A real problem has a real solution.

1230
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:52,621
[Conrad]
I've heard this before.

1231
01:10:52,699 --> 01:10:55,725
Doesn't make it any less true.

1232
01:10:55,802 --> 01:10:57,292
I'm so tired.

1233
01:10:57,371 --> 01:11:00,397
That's some secret
you've been keeping.

1234
01:11:00,474 --> 01:11:03,500
So what do I do now?

1235
01:11:05,112 --> 01:11:07,137
Recognize her limitations.

1236
01:11:08,248 --> 01:11:10,739
Like she can't love me.

1237
01:11:10,817 --> 01:11:14,753
No. Like she can't
love you enough.

1238
01:11:14,821 --> 01:11:17,984
Don't blame her
for not loving you...

1239
01:11:18,058 --> 01:11:20,049
more than she's able.

1240
01:11:20,127 --> 01:11:22,118
She loves my father.

1241
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,186
She loved my brother.

1242
01:11:24,264 --> 01:11:25,925
It's me.

1243
01:11:25,999 --> 01:11:29,093
We're back to
the rotten kid routine.

1244
01:11:29,169 --> 01:11:33,003
She can't love you
because you're unlovable.

1245
01:11:33,073 --> 01:11:36,167
How come your Dad loves you?

1246
01:11:36,243 --> 01:11:38,711
He feels responsible.

1247
01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:40,770
Besides. He loves everybody.

1248
01:11:40,847 --> 01:11:43,372
The guy's got no taste.

1249
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:46,442
He loves you. But he's wrong.

1250
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,987
Look...

1251
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:51,047
maybe she can't express it...

1252
01:11:51,124 --> 01:11:53,092
the way you'd like.

1253
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,425
Maybe she's afraid
to show her feelings.

1254
01:11:56,496 --> 01:11:58,726
What do you mean?

1255
01:11:58,799 --> 01:12:01,131
There's someone
besides your mother...

1256
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:02,793
you've got to forgive.

1257
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:04,632
You mean me?

1258
01:12:06,506 --> 01:12:09,031
For trying to off myself?

1259
01:12:11,178 --> 01:12:13,169
Don't stare.
What for?

1260
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:17,182
Why don't you let yourself
off the hook?

1261
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,276
What did I do?

1262
01:12:20,353 --> 01:12:21,945
What did I do?

1263
01:12:22,022 --> 01:12:23,489
We'll talk Thursday.

1264
01:12:23,557 --> 01:12:24,489
Come on!

1265
01:12:24,558 --> 01:12:26,287
Time's up.

1266
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:28,793
What did I do?

1267
01:12:28,862 --> 01:12:30,261
You know the rules.

1268
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:31,820
What rules?

1269
01:12:31,898 --> 01:12:33,593
Think about it.

1270
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,259
Just think about it.

1271
01:12:38,405 --> 01:12:39,667
Jesus!

1272
01:12:43,877 --> 01:12:46,437
Say. After going to a new high...

1273
01:12:46,513 --> 01:12:48,879
it falls to 1121/4...

1274
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:51,941
and then rallies on good volume.

1275
01:12:52,018 --> 01:12:54,452
I order to buy 4.000.

1276
01:12:54,521 --> 01:12:58,787
If I get the 4.000 at 1133/4.
I know something's wrong.

1277
01:12:58,859 --> 01:13:02,795
But suppose I order
to buy the 4.000 shares...

1278
01:13:02,863 --> 01:13:05,730
and I plug in at 1133/4...

1279
01:13:05,799 --> 01:13:09,667
I get 2.000 at 114.
500 at 1141/4...

1280
01:13:09,736 --> 01:13:12,603
and the rest on the way up.

1281
01:13:12,672 --> 01:13:14,697
Then I know I'm right.

1282
01:13:14,774 --> 01:13:17,641
I'm going to peel off here.

1283
01:13:17,711 --> 01:13:19,645
See you later.

1284
01:13:24,384 --> 01:13:27,012
[Voice Echoing]
Suppose the order to buy...

1285
01:13:27,087 --> 01:13:29,021
[Beth's Voice]
You let him walk all over us...

1286
01:13:29,089 --> 01:13:30,351
and you apologize.

1287
01:13:30,423 --> 01:13:32,084
[Man's Voice]
500 at 114...

1288
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,127
[Conrad's Voice]
Dad, you don't see things.

1289
01:13:34,194 --> 01:13:35,991
[Beth]
You've been apologizing...

1290
01:13:36,062 --> 01:13:39,361
since he returned from the hospital.

1291
01:13:39,432 --> 01:13:41,366
Tell her to stop it!

1292
01:13:41,434 --> 01:13:44,494
Buck never would've
been in the hospital!

1293
01:13:44,571 --> 01:13:45,902
She hates me!

1294
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:09,924
I want to be clear.

1295
01:14:09,996 --> 01:14:11,793
That's good.

1296
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:18,296
In the car.
I was thinking. "be clear."

1297
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:24,142
I suppose that's what
psychiatry's about.

1298
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:26,611
Being precise and clear.

1299
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,648
And honest, of course.

1300
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:34,009
I'm not a great believer
in psychiatry.

1301
01:14:34,087 --> 01:14:35,816
Okay.

1302
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:39,518
What happens here
is between you and him...

1303
01:14:39,593 --> 01:14:41,584
and I respect that.

1304
01:14:41,661 --> 01:14:44,095
He's better.
I can see that.

1305
01:14:44,164 --> 01:14:46,962
I just don't believe in psychiatry...

1306
01:14:47,033 --> 01:14:50,298
as a panacea for everybody.

1307
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:51,837
Neither do I.

1308
01:14:54,808 --> 01:14:59,370
I wish I knew what
I was doing here.

1309
01:14:59,446 --> 01:15:03,405
You said you could shed
some light on some things.

1310
01:15:03,483 --> 01:15:07,044
I meant in terms of Conrad.

1311
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,611
I knew something was wrong...

1312
01:15:09,689 --> 01:15:12,180
even before he tried suicide.

1313
01:15:12,259 --> 01:15:14,227
But I thought that...

1314
01:15:15,328 --> 01:15:18,320
It's clear that he's very smart.

1315
01:15:18,398 --> 01:15:21,390
He's always been
an "A" student.

1316
01:15:21,468 --> 01:15:23,959
Naturally. I thought
intelligent people...

1317
01:15:24,037 --> 01:15:26,437
could work out their problems.

1318
01:15:26,506 --> 01:15:29,100
But you still feel responsible?

1319
01:15:29,175 --> 01:15:31,200
Yeah, sure I do.

1320
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,303
It's hard not to.

1321
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:37,942
It was just luck that
I happened to be there...

1322
01:15:38,018 --> 01:15:39,986
when he tried it.

1323
01:15:40,053 --> 01:15:42,749
We both could've been away.

1324
01:15:42,822 --> 01:15:46,815
You think of yourself
as a lucky man?

1325
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:48,383
No. No. No.

1326
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:53,489
I used to think that
I was a lucky person...

1327
01:15:53,566 --> 01:15:55,227
before the accident.

1328
01:15:59,906 --> 01:16:02,932
I guess the whole of life...

1329
01:16:03,009 --> 01:16:05,477
is nothing but an accident...

1330
01:16:05,545 --> 01:16:07,410
what happens to you.

1331
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,415
That sounds like
the philosophy of a drifter.

1332
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,314
Yeah. Maybe.

1333
01:16:12,385 --> 01:16:14,717
Maybe I am drifting a little.

1334
01:16:14,788 --> 01:16:18,315
I can see the two of them...

1335
01:16:18,391 --> 01:16:20,382
drifting away from me...

1336
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,985
and I just stand watching.

1337
01:16:23,063 --> 01:16:27,227
What would you want
to do about that?

1338
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,791
Something.
I don't know what.

1339
01:16:29,869 --> 01:16:33,327
I feel like
I'm sitting on a fence.

1340
01:16:33,406 --> 01:16:36,432
They're on opposite sides
of this fence?

1341
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:39,239
Yeah... No.

1342
01:16:39,312 --> 01:16:40,506
I don't know.

1343
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:45,142
I see her not being able
to forgive him.

1344
01:16:46,219 --> 01:16:47,743
For what?

1345
01:16:47,821 --> 01:16:49,755
I don't know exactly.

1346
01:16:49,823 --> 01:16:52,314
Being too much like her.

1347
01:16:52,392 --> 01:16:57,420
People always think that
she and Buck are... were alike.

1348
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:01,523
But it's really she and Conrad.

1349
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:04,092
They were the only two...

1350
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:07,162
that didn't cry at the funeral.

1351
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,267
It's not easy for me to admit this...

1352
01:17:11,344 --> 01:17:12,811
but. Um...

1353
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:14,346
she didn't...

1354
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:21,878
His mother doesn't
show him much affection.

1355
01:17:21,955 --> 01:17:25,618
I'm not trying
to put her down.

1356
01:17:25,692 --> 01:17:29,219
Did she give Buck
much affection?

1357
01:17:29,295 --> 01:17:31,729
God. Yes.
She loved Buck.

1358
01:17:31,798 --> 01:17:33,766
Bucky got so much.

1359
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:37,360
What she felt for him was special.

1360
01:17:37,437 --> 01:17:39,962
He was her first-born.

1361
01:17:40,039 --> 01:17:41,802
And you?

1362
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,342
I loved Buck.

1363
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,571
I mean your wife's affection.

1364
01:17:45,645 --> 01:17:47,112
For me?

1365
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:48,477
Yes.

1366
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,345
She's very...

1367
01:17:51,418 --> 01:17:55,514
No. There's no problem
with her for me.

1368
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:59,285
We've been married
nearly 21 years.

Everybody loves Beth.

1370
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:05,329
For Conrad. It's been difficult.

1371
01:18:05,398 --> 01:18:08,196
He didn't talk about that?

1372
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:11,260
We don't know what happens here.

1373
01:18:11,337 --> 01:18:13,305
It doesn't come up.

1374
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:20,746
I guess that's what it is.

1375
01:18:20,814 --> 01:18:23,146
It's private here. Isn't it?

1376
01:18:23,216 --> 01:18:24,649
Mm-hmm.
Very private.

1377
01:18:28,421 --> 01:18:32,357
I think I know why I came here.

1378
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:37,794
I think I came here
to talk about myself.

1379
01:18:37,864 --> 01:18:40,628
Okay. Why don't we?

1380
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,475
Hi.

[Buzzing Continues]

1384
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,116
What's the matter?

1385
01:19:04,257 --> 01:19:06,748
This will sound strange.

1386
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:12,321
What I'm going to say
will sound strange.

1387
01:19:12,398 --> 01:19:13,865
What happened?

1388
01:19:13,933 --> 01:19:15,366
Come inside.

1389
01:19:16,703 --> 01:19:19,467
Could we talk about
Buck's funeral?

1390
01:19:19,539 --> 01:19:21,131
What?

1391
01:19:21,207 --> 01:19:25,200
It'll seem trivial.
But it's on my mind.

1392
01:19:25,278 --> 01:19:28,247
I'd like to talk about it.

1393
01:19:28,314 --> 01:19:32,250
When I was getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1394
01:19:32,318 --> 01:19:35,776
What could getting dressed
for Buck's funeral...

1395
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:38,323
have to do with anything?

1396
01:19:38,391 --> 01:19:41,019
I was wearing a blue shirt.

1397
01:19:41,094 --> 01:19:45,656
You said. "Wear a white shirt
and other shoes."

1398
01:19:45,732 --> 01:19:50,795
It was nothing. But
it seemed to stay with me.

1399
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:53,361
What difference did it make...

1400
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:56,465
what I wore to Buck's funeral?

1401
01:19:56,543 --> 01:19:58,534
Hear me out. Beth!

1402
01:19:58,611 --> 01:20:01,637
No one would listen to that.

1403
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,581
I just want to talk about it.

1404
01:20:04,651 --> 01:20:07,552
Why do you want to remind me?

1405
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:12,455
Because I've wondered what
it mattered what I wore.

1406
01:20:12,525 --> 01:20:15,016
I was crazy that day.

1407
01:20:15,094 --> 01:20:19,155
We were going
to our son's funeral.

1408
01:20:21,634 --> 01:20:25,400
You were worried about
what I wore on my feet.

1409
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:28,269
It sticks with me...

1410
01:20:28,341 --> 01:20:31,970
and I wanted to
tell you about it.

1411
01:20:45,124 --> 01:20:46,614
It's all right.

1412
01:21:01,074 --> 01:21:03,065
Beth! How are you?

1413
01:21:03,142 --> 01:21:05,133
Fine. How are you?

1414
01:21:05,211 --> 01:21:07,202
I haven't seen you.

1415
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,771
I'll call you. How's Brad?

1416
01:21:09,849 --> 01:21:12,340
Fabulous! Is everything okay?

1417
01:21:12,418 --> 01:21:13,908
Isn't this madness?

1418
01:21:13,987 --> 01:21:16,478
It gets worse every year.

1419
01:21:16,556 --> 01:21:18,023
Good-bye.

01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:32,794
May I show you this?

1423
01:21:32,872 --> 01:21:35,363
Oh. No. No. Thanks.

Bennetts. Grants. And Foleys.

1425
01:21:45,585 --> 01:21:49,112
Conrad should get something
for my parents.

1426
01:21:49,188 --> 01:21:53,784
He's not getting something
for his doctor. Is he?

1427
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:57,125
We should go see Dr. Berger.

1428
01:21:57,196 --> 01:21:58,424
What?

1429
01:21:58,498 --> 01:22:01,490
We could all go see him.

1430
01:22:01,567 --> 01:22:02,932
Why?

1431
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:05,971
He thinks it's a good idea.

1432
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:08,507
What's he know about me?

1433
01:22:08,574 --> 01:22:11,236
I've never even met him.

1434
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:16,009
Wouldn't it be easier
if we all talked about it?

1435
01:22:16,082 --> 01:22:18,573
What will we talk about?

1436
01:22:18,651 --> 01:22:21,142
Don't try to change me.

1437
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:22,687
Hasn't enough happened?

1438
01:22:22,755 --> 01:22:26,350
Let's hold on to what we've got.

1439
01:22:26,426 --> 01:22:28,826
That's what this is for.

1440
01:22:28,895 --> 01:22:30,328
Maybe you'll be surprised.

1441
01:22:30,396 --> 01:22:32,091
I don't want surprises.

1442
01:22:34,467 --> 01:22:36,958
I know I'm not perfect.

1443
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:40,631
If I can't hug everybody
like you. I'm sorry.

1444
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:43,039
You're missing the point.

1445
01:22:43,109 --> 01:22:46,169
I don't want to see counselors.

1446
01:22:46,245 --> 01:22:48,713
This is my family.

1447
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:50,772
We will solve our problems...

1448
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:54,377
in the privacy of our own home...

1449
01:22:54,454 --> 01:22:56,945
not by running to some...

1450
01:22:57,023 --> 01:22:58,615
Ready to order?

1451
01:22:58,691 --> 01:23:02,218
Could you give me
a few minutes?

1452
01:23:02,295 --> 01:23:06,322
Running to experts every time
something goes wrong.

1453
01:23:11,704 --> 01:23:14,400
I know you mean well.

1454
01:23:14,474 --> 01:23:18,137
I want this to be
a nice Christmas.

1455
01:23:18,211 --> 01:23:21,669
I want them all to be nice.

1456
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:25,081
You and I need time together.

1457
01:23:25,151 --> 01:23:27,585
We must get away.

1458
01:23:27,653 --> 01:23:30,986
New Years'. We'll spend
time in Houston...

1459
01:23:31,057 --> 01:23:32,524
with my brother.

1460
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:35,152
Play some golf. Relax.

1461
01:23:36,295 --> 01:23:38,126
I've talked to Mother.

1462
01:23:38,197 --> 01:23:40,688
Conrad can stay with them.

1463
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:43,327
Please don't worry about it.

1464
01:23:43,402 --> 01:23:46,633
Please. For his sake.
Don't indulge him.

1465
01:23:46,706 --> 01:23:49,197
We need time together.

1466
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:50,867
Okay?

1467
01:23:52,011 --> 01:23:53,638
Okay.

1468
01:23:53,713 --> 01:23:55,840
Okay.

1469
01:23:55,915 --> 01:23:57,542
I love you.

1470
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:02,150
I love you. Too.

1471
01:24:06,325 --> 01:24:09,522
Let's just give things time. Okay?

1472
01:24:09,595 --> 01:24:10,926
Okay.

1473
01:24:21,207 --> 01:24:22,538
Conrad.

1474
01:24:22,608 --> 01:24:23,632
Hmm?

1475
01:24:23,709 --> 01:24:25,370
I don't bowl.

1476
01:24:25,444 --> 01:24:27,139
I'm a horrible bowler.

1477
01:24:27,213 --> 01:24:28,646
That's all right.

1478
01:24:28,714 --> 01:24:30,909
Yeah. Well...

1479
01:24:32,652 --> 01:24:34,085
I got it.

1480
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:37,589
The thing is.
I'm a funny bowler.

1481
01:24:37,657 --> 01:24:40,626
Listen. We don't
have to go bowling.

1482
01:24:40,693 --> 01:24:43,093
I'm not a bowling nut.

1483
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:44,720
How funny are you?

1484
01:24:44,797 --> 01:24:49,131
On a scale from 1 to 10...
About a 10.

1485
01:24:49,202 --> 01:24:50,601
That's pretty funny.

1486
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:53,070
I promise you won't look silly.

1487
01:24:53,139 --> 01:24:54,800
Guarantee it?

1488
01:24:54,874 --> 01:24:56,205
Guarantee it.

1489
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:24,526
Can you break the ball?

1490
01:25:25,638 --> 01:25:29,130
Can't break anything
in a bowling alley.

1491
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:32,075
That's what I like
about bowling alleys.

1492
01:25:32,144 --> 01:25:34,339
Can't even break the record.

1493
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,544
Anyway...

1494
01:25:43,623 --> 01:25:45,454
Hmm? What?

1495
01:25:45,524 --> 01:25:47,788
It's a conversation starter.

1496
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,157
Catchy.

1497
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:50,490
You like it?

1498
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:54,226
I've been working on it all day.

1499
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:57,792
Are people punished
for things they do?

1500
01:25:57,870 --> 01:25:59,337
By God?

1501
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:00,372
Yeah.

1502
01:26:00,439 --> 01:26:02,930
I don't believe in God.

1503
01:26:03,009 --> 01:26:04,476
Not at all?

1504
01:26:04,543 --> 01:26:06,909
Either you do or don't.

1505
01:26:06,979 --> 01:26:10,176
I believe in God.

1506
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:13,548
You afraid he'll punish you
for something?

1507
01:26:13,619 --> 01:26:17,612
I've done many things
I'm ashamed of.

1508
01:26:19,659 --> 01:26:21,650
Yeah? So have I.

1509
01:26:29,902 --> 01:26:31,494
Did it hurt?

1510
01:26:37,543 --> 01:26:39,477
I don't remember really.

1511
01:26:39,545 --> 01:26:43,003
You don't want
to talk about it?

1512
01:26:43,082 --> 01:26:46,176
I've never really
talked about it.

1513
01:26:46,252 --> 01:26:50,823
To doctors.
But not to anyone else.

1514
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:52,321
You're the first who's asked.

1515
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:55,019
Why did you do it?

1516
01:26:55,093 --> 01:26:56,424
Uh...

1517
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:05,092
I don't know.
It was like...

1518
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:07,138
falling into a hole.

1519
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:11,732
It was like falling into a hole.

1520
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,801
It keeps getting bigger...

1521
01:27:13,879 --> 01:27:15,847
and you can't escape.

1522
01:27:15,914 --> 01:27:19,281
All of a sudden, it's inside...

1523
01:27:19,351 --> 01:27:20,943
and you're the hole.

1524
01:27:21,019 --> 01:27:24,113
You're trapped.
And it's all over.

1525
01:27:24,189 --> 01:27:26,089
Something like that.

1526
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:28,126
It's not really scary...

1527
01:27:28,193 --> 01:27:30,787
except when
you think back on it.

1528
01:27:30,863 --> 01:27:35,232
'Cause you know
what you were feeling...

1529
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,699
# Like McDonald's can #

1530
01:27:36,768 --> 01:27:39,168
# Nobody can do it #

1531
01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:40,865
# Like McDonald's can #

1532
01:27:40,939 --> 01:27:44,773
# You deserve
a break today #

1533
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:47,778
# So get up
and get away #

1534
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:49,609
Hey. Jarrett.

1535
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,775
How you doing?
How about some fries?

1536
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:54,716
What are you doing?

1537
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,156
Hey. Lighten up.

1538
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:02,318
Hey. I don't like your attitude.

1539
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:30,582
Energetic. Those guys.

1540
01:28:30,656 --> 01:28:32,556
They were pretty funny.

1541
01:28:32,624 --> 01:28:34,091
No.

1542
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,150
You thought they were.

1543
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,695
No. L...

1544
01:28:46,972 --> 01:28:48,462
I'm sorry.

1545
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,007
What for?

1546
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:55,646
Anyway...

1547
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:14,087
Do you want to talk?

1548
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:15,633
About what?

1549
01:29:17,736 --> 01:29:19,203
Are you okay?

1550
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:20,738
Yeah.

1551
01:29:20,806 --> 01:29:22,273
Yeah. I'm fine.

1552
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:26,310
I'll give you a call.

1553
01:29:26,378 --> 01:29:29,609
Will you? I want you to.

1554
01:29:29,681 --> 01:29:31,615
Sure.

1555
01:29:39,725 --> 01:29:41,192
Well...

1556
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:44,751
I'll see you in choir.

1557
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:46,297
Okay. Yeah.

1558
01:29:46,365 --> 01:29:48,526
Thanks.

1559
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,397
Okay.

1560
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:52,960
I mean. Good night.

1561
01:29:53,038 --> 01:29:54,505
Good night.

1562

Seven.

1563
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,912
In preparation
for our landing in Houston,

1564
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:15,016
observe the fasten
seat belt sign,

1565
01:30:15,093 --> 01:30:18,256
and no smoking until
well inside the terminal.

1566
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,731
Watch this.

1567
01:30:29,808 --> 01:30:31,241
Pessimistic golfer.

1568
01:30:31,309 --> 01:30:32,799
Pessimistic golfer.

1569
01:30:33,912 --> 01:30:35,402
Oh. Damn!

1570
01:30:37,382 --> 01:30:39,373
Are we two up?

1571
01:30:39,451 --> 01:30:40,941
Two.

1572
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:42,509
Let's hustle up.

1573
01:30:42,587 --> 01:30:44,578
It is flat here.

1574
01:30:44,656 --> 01:30:48,752
But we decided
to teach you to love it.

He wants everybody to move here.

1576
01:30:51,963 --> 01:30:54,488
It's good to see you.

1577
01:30:54,566 --> 01:30:57,763
- You look tired. Cal.
- Airplane scotch.

1578
01:30:57,836 --> 01:31:00,498
Why am I still hungry?

1579
01:31:00,572 --> 01:31:02,437
'Cause you're in Texas.

1580
01:31:02,507 --> 01:31:04,498
We'll get you home.

1581
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,544
Get some steaks on.

1582
01:31:06,611 --> 01:31:08,772
A baked potato. Too?

1583
01:31:08,847 --> 01:31:12,408
How long has he had
that drawl?

1584
01:31:12,484 --> 01:31:14,509
Since joining the club.

It sure wasn't funny.

We weren't that bad.

1588
01:32:06,505 --> 01:32:11,067
I can't listen to that
Buck Jarrett lecture again.

1589
01:32:11,143 --> 01:32:14,670
He bugs me
when he does that.

1590
01:32:14,746 --> 01:32:18,307
Will he ever stop
kissing his picture?

1591
01:32:18,383 --> 01:32:19,850
Stillman. Shut up.

1592
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:23,277
Connie. Want a ride?

1593
01:32:23,355 --> 01:32:24,822
Oh. No. Thanks.

1594
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:27,415
We could've used you today.

1595
01:32:27,492 --> 01:32:29,483
I don't think so.

1596
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:32,530
Nobody could've helped us.

1597
01:32:32,597 --> 01:32:35,589
I hear you got eyes for Pratt.

1598
01:32:35,667 --> 01:32:37,430
Made it with her yet?

1599
01:32:37,502 --> 01:32:38,935
Don't be a prick.

1600
01:32:39,004 --> 01:32:41,097
You're the prick.

1601
01:32:41,173 --> 01:32:45,701
You give me a goddamn
pain in the ass.

1602
01:32:50,115 --> 01:32:52,743
Connie. Come on!
Come on!

No!

No!

01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:05,190
Let go! Let go!

1608
01:33:05,263 --> 01:33:07,629
It's all right!

1609
01:33:07,699 --> 01:33:10,133
Just calm down.

You're crazy!
You know that?

1611
01:33:15,207 --> 01:33:18,643
Send him back
where he came from!

It's over. It's over.

Here's your hat.

You want to talk?

The guy's a nothing.

1618

He's a zero upstairs.

1619
01:33:53,311 --> 01:33:56,280
Since fourth grade,
you've known that.

1620
01:33:56,348 --> 01:33:58,339
So you look stupid...

1621
01:33:58,416 --> 01:34:01,351
when you let him get to you!

So I look stupid?

What's with you?

1624
01:34:05,523 --> 01:34:10,119
Why do you want
to be in this alone?

01:34:12,597 --> 01:34:15,430
You know. I miss him. Too.

The three of us
were best friends.

to be around you.

01:38:28,519 --> 01:38:31,010
Good. You're here.

1684
01:38:31,089 --> 01:38:32,522
Something happened.

1685
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:34,057
Just a minute.

1686
01:38:34,125 --> 01:38:36,593
Wait till we get inside.

1687
01:38:38,763 --> 01:38:39,695
There.

1688
01:38:41,265 --> 01:38:42,823
Shit.

1689
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:46,597
You'd think they'd assume
there'd be emergencies.

1690
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:48,536
Don't take it off.
Just sit down.

1691
01:38:53,277 --> 01:38:54,209
Something happened.

1692
01:38:54,278 --> 01:38:55,336
What?

1693
01:38:55,413 --> 01:38:56,812
It's...

1694
01:38:56,881 --> 01:38:58,280
It's what?

1695
01:38:58,349 --> 01:38:59,816
Oh. God!

1696
01:39:01,419 --> 01:39:02,943
I need something.

1697
01:39:03,021 --> 01:39:04,147
What?

1698
01:39:04,222 --> 01:39:05,712
It keeps coming.

1699
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:07,690
I can't stop it!

1700
01:39:07,759 --> 01:39:09,351
Don't try.

1701
01:39:09,427 --> 01:39:11,952
Got to get off the hook.

1702
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:13,657
For what?

1703
01:39:13,731 --> 01:39:15,790
What I did to him!

1704
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:16,993
What?

1705
01:39:17,068 --> 01:39:19,536
It must be somebody's fault...

1706
01:39:19,604 --> 01:39:21,765
or there's no point!

1707
01:39:21,839 --> 01:39:23,830
What point? It happened!

1708
01:39:23,908 --> 01:39:26,968
Oh. No. I don't mean that.

1709
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:28,535
It's just that...

1710
01:39:28,613 --> 01:39:31,138
Bucky. I didn't mean it.

1711
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:34,184
Bucky, I didn't mean it.

1712
01:39:34,252 --> 01:39:36,083
Bucky!

1713
01:39:36,154 --> 01:39:37,178
It wasn't your fault.

1714
01:39:37,255 --> 01:39:39,553
You said. "Get the sail down!"

1715
01:39:39,624 --> 01:39:41,751
I couldn't! It jammed!

1716
01:39:41,826 --> 01:39:43,521
And then the halyard jammed!

1717
01:39:43,594 --> 01:39:45,528
Because the goddamned
halyard jammed!

1718
01:39:45,596 --> 01:39:48,531
Then you're sittin' here
screwing around!

1719
01:39:48,599 --> 01:39:50,328
Until it's too late!

1720
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:53,564
And I'm supposed
to take care of it!

1721
01:39:53,638 --> 01:39:54,832
That wasn't fair.

1722
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:57,841
No! And then
you say. "Hang on!"

1723
01:39:57,909 --> 01:39:59,001
"Hang on!"

1724
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:00,704
Then you let go!

1725
01:40:00,778 --> 01:40:02,336
Why'd you let go?

1726
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:03,641
I got tired!

1727
01:40:03,714 --> 01:40:06,342
Yeah? Well. Screw you. You jerk!

1728
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:22,231
It hurts to be mad at him.

1729
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:23,767
Yeah.

1730
01:40:26,037 --> 01:40:28,062
He just wasn't careful.

1731
01:40:28,139 --> 01:40:32,041
He didn't see how
a bad thing might happen.

1732
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:35,876
Bad things happen even
when people are careful.

1733
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:37,881
We should've come in...

1734
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:40,543
when it started to look bad.

1735
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:42,950
So you made a mistake.

1736
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:45,318
Why did he let go?

1737
01:40:45,389 --> 01:40:46,879
Why?

1738
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:50,018
Maybe you were stronger.

1739
01:40:50,094 --> 01:40:53,325
Did that ever occur to you?

1740
01:41:01,272 --> 01:41:04,264
How long will you
punish yourself?

1741
01:41:04,342 --> 01:41:05,468
When will you quit?

1742
01:41:05,543 --> 01:41:07,238
I'd like to.

1743
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:08,642
Why don't you?

1744
01:41:08,713 --> 01:41:11,443
It's not that easy.

1745
01:41:18,022 --> 01:41:19,489
God...

1746
01:41:19,557 --> 01:41:21,525
I loved him.

1747
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,654
I know.

1748
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,377
What happened?
What started all this?

1749
01:41:45,449 --> 01:41:46,939
Karen.

1750
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:51,017
She killed herself.

1751
01:41:51,088 --> 01:41:54,114
I just found out she's dead.

1752
01:41:54,192 --> 01:41:56,251
Jesus.

1753
01:41:56,327 --> 01:41:58,522
She was fine.

1754
01:41:58,596 --> 01:42:00,928
No. She wasn't.

1755
01:42:00,998 --> 01:42:04,490
She told me!
She said she was...

1756
01:42:04,569 --> 01:42:05,536
What?

1757
01:42:05,603 --> 01:42:08,367
She was busy and
feeling good and...

1758
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:09,463
What?

1759
01:42:11,242 --> 01:42:12,436
What?

1760
01:42:12,510 --> 01:42:13,909
If I'd known...

1761
01:42:13,978 --> 01:42:15,468
I could've done something.

1762
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:18,344
You're taking her on. Too?

1763
01:42:18,416 --> 01:42:19,348
No!

1764
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:20,349
No?

1765
01:42:20,418 --> 01:42:21,885
No. I just...

1766
01:42:21,953 --> 01:42:22,885
What?

1767
01:42:22,954 --> 01:42:24,387
That isn't it.

1768
01:42:24,455 --> 01:42:27,549
I feel really bad about this.

1769
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:30,958
Just let me feel bad about this!

1770
01:42:32,129 --> 01:42:33,426
Okay.

1771
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:38,998
Listen. I feel
bad about it. Too.

1772
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,565
Why do things
happen to people?

1773
01:42:45,643 --> 01:42:48,043
It isn't fair.

1774
01:42:48,112 --> 01:42:50,808
You're right.
It isn't fair.

1775
01:42:50,881 --> 01:42:53,281
You just do one wrong thing...

1776
01:42:53,351 --> 01:42:54,818
and...

1777
01:42:54,885 --> 01:42:57,479
Um-hmm.

1778
01:42:57,555 --> 01:43:01,389
And what was the one
wrong thing you did?

1779
01:43:08,365 --> 01:43:09,832
You know.

1780
01:43:22,846 --> 01:43:24,609
You know.

1781
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:29,518
I hung on.

1782
01:43:29,586 --> 01:43:32,714
I stayed with the boat.

1783
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:34,417
Exactly.

1784
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:44,123
Now. You can live
with that. Can't you?

1785
01:43:50,274 --> 01:43:52,242
I'm scared!

1786
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,504
I'm scared.

1787
01:43:54,578 --> 01:43:56,808
Feelings are scary.

1788
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,973
And sometimes they're painful.

1789
01:43:59,049 --> 01:44:01,313
If you can't feel pain...

1790
01:44:01,385 --> 01:44:04,377
you won't feel
anything else.

1791
01:44:04,455 --> 01:44:07,049
You know what I'm saying?

1792
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,718
I think so.

1793
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:16,394
You're here. You're alive.

1794
01:44:16,467 --> 01:44:19,265
Don't say you don't feel that.

1795
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:21,566
It doesn't feel good.

1796
01:44:21,638 --> 01:44:23,071
It is good.

1797
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:24,607
Believe me.

1798
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,878
How do you know?

1799
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:35,145
Because I'm your friend.

1800
01:44:39,456 --> 01:44:42,892
I don't know
what I would've done...

1801
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,394
if you hadn't been here.

1802
01:44:48,966 --> 01:44:51,696
You're really my friend?

1803
01:44:53,804 --> 01:44:56,602
I am. Count on it.

1804
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:50,792
Hi.

1805
01:45:50,861 --> 01:45:52,294
I would've called...

1806
01:45:52,362 --> 01:45:55,297
but I didn't
want to wake anyone.

1807
01:45:55,365 --> 01:45:56,798
About the other night...

1808
01:45:56,867 --> 01:45:59,301
I liked being with you.

1809
01:45:59,369 --> 01:46:01,803
I didn't like myself.

1810
01:46:01,872 --> 01:46:03,806
Conrad. I was stupid.

1811
01:46:03,874 --> 01:46:06,809
That was dumb of me to laugh.

1812
01:46:06,877 --> 01:46:08,811
It was my fault.

1813
01:46:08,879 --> 01:46:10,904
I was embarrassed.

1814
01:46:10,981 --> 01:46:12,141
Really?

1815
01:46:12,216 --> 01:46:13,979
You were embarrassed?

1816
01:46:14,051 --> 01:46:16,281
When those boys came in...

1817
01:46:16,353 --> 01:46:18,844
it was awful and awkward.

1818
01:46:18,922 --> 01:46:21,186
When I'm embarrassed. I laugh.

1819
01:46:21,258 --> 01:46:24,557
They were just having
a good time.

1820
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:28,587
I let them interfere
with what was happening.

1821
01:46:28,665 --> 01:46:30,132
It was dumb.

1822
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:33,727
I've done lots of
dumb things lately.

1823
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:38,503
I just didn't know if you were
being straight with me.

1824
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:43,112
Yeah?

1825
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:46,547
Anyway. I'd like
to try it again.

1826
01:46:46,617 --> 01:46:48,050
It worked okay...

1827
01:46:48,118 --> 01:46:50,245
except for the bowling.

1828
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,787
Yes.

1829
01:46:51,855 --> 01:46:53,720
Yes?

1830
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,884
Yes.

1831
01:46:57,961 --> 01:47:00,452
Are you going to school?

1832
01:47:00,531 --> 01:47:03,364
No. Not on Sunday.

1833
01:47:06,203 --> 01:47:08,194
Have you eaten?

1834
01:47:08,272 --> 01:47:10,297
No. I haven't.

1835
01:47:10,374 --> 01:47:12,808
Do you want some breakfast?

1836
01:47:14,745 --> 01:47:16,212
Okay.

1837
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,257
Mom!

1838
01:47:33,130 --> 01:47:35,496
All right.
How about that?

1839
01:47:35,566 --> 01:47:36,999
Boy. Oh. Boy.

1840
01:47:37,067 --> 01:47:39,035
I do love that.

1841
01:47:39,102 --> 01:47:42,094
These holes sure do love you.

1842
01:47:42,172 --> 01:47:46,165
We should spend more time
playing golf together.

1843
01:47:46,243 --> 01:47:49,212
Maybe our next vacation...
strictly golf.

1844
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:50,746
Pinehurst.
Myrtle Beach.

1845
01:47:50,814 --> 01:47:52,782
Pinehurst would be nice.

1846
01:47:52,849 --> 01:47:55,841
I think Connie would
like Pinehurst.

1847
01:47:55,919 --> 01:47:59,377
Is that deliberate
or just a reflex?

1848
01:47:59,456 --> 01:48:02,448
I assumed you meant him. Too.

1849
01:48:02,526 --> 01:48:05,495
I'm surprised you
haven't called him.

1850
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:07,530
I'll call him tonight.

1851
01:48:07,598 --> 01:48:10,590
Can we have a little drink?

1852
01:48:10,667 --> 01:48:12,635
Drink. Yes. Little. No.

1853
01:48:12,703 --> 01:48:14,170
Let's finish this.

1854
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:15,170
What?

1855
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:16,706
What you started.

1856
01:48:16,773 --> 01:48:18,741
Me? There's no point.

1857
01:48:18,809 --> 01:48:20,276
He controls you.

1858
01:48:20,344 --> 01:48:22,312
He isn't the problem.

1859
01:48:22,379 --> 01:48:23,846
Isn't he?

1860
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:27,315
No. Let's talk about
what's bothering you.

1861
01:48:27,384 --> 01:48:30,376
No. Let's discuss
what's bothering you.

1862
01:48:30,454 --> 01:48:34,447
How did I make you
so angry with me?

1863
01:48:34,524 --> 01:48:36,992
You blame me
for everything.

1864
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:39,528
Can't you see
beyond yourself?

1865
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:41,063
No. I can't!

1866
01:48:41,131 --> 01:48:44,123
Neither can you
or anybody else!

1867
01:48:44,201 --> 01:48:45,634
I'm just honest.

1868
01:48:45,702 --> 01:48:47,169
Stop being honest...

1869
01:48:47,237 --> 01:48:49,205
and start being generous!

1870
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:50,740
Think about him!

1871
01:48:50,807 --> 01:48:53,776
What does he expect from me?

1872
01:48:53,844 --> 01:48:57,837
He wants a hug
when he passes exams?

1873
01:48:57,914 --> 01:49:00,906
I can't respond
when someone says...

1874
01:49:00,984 --> 01:49:03,953
"I did something
great. Love me."

1875
01:49:04,021 --> 01:49:08,014
He wants to know
you don't hate him.

1876
01:49:08,091 --> 01:49:10,582
Mothers don't hate their sons.

1877
01:49:10,661 --> 01:49:13,630
Is that what he told you?

1878
01:49:13,697 --> 01:49:17,690
You accept what he says
with no questions.

1879
01:49:17,768 --> 01:49:20,760
I'm trying to
keep this family...

1880
01:49:20,837 --> 01:49:23,806
What does everyone
want from me?

1881
01:49:23,874 --> 01:49:28,311
Listen. We all just
want you to be happy.

1882
01:49:28,378 --> 01:49:29,845
Happy?

1883
01:49:29,913 --> 01:49:30,880
Yes.

1884
01:49:30,947 --> 01:49:34,644
You tell me
the definition of happy.

1885
01:49:34,718 --> 01:49:37,983
First. Be sure your kids are safe...

1886
01:49:38,055 --> 01:49:41,547
that nobody's been hit by a car...

1887
01:49:41,625 --> 01:49:44,617
or drowned in your swimming pool!

1888
01:49:44,695 --> 01:49:48,187
Then tell me how to be happy!

1889
01:50:41,718 --> 01:50:44,186
I'm turning in.

1890
01:50:44,254 --> 01:50:45,721
Dinner was good.

1891
01:50:45,789 --> 01:50:47,256
Really good.

1892
01:50:47,324 --> 01:50:49,758
It's early. You tired?

1893
01:50:49,826 --> 01:50:52,090
It was a rough week.

1894
01:50:52,162 --> 01:50:55,893
Your grandmother
wasn't too tough on you?

1895
01:50:55,966 --> 01:50:57,934
No. She was fine.

1896
01:51:00,504 --> 01:51:03,029
I'm glad you're back.

1897
01:51:17,387 --> 01:51:18,854
Good night.

1898
01:52:37,634 --> 01:52:42,037
[Sobbing]

1899
01:52:48,779 --> 01:52:50,212
Calvin?

1900
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,059
Why are you crying?

1901
01:53:10,901 --> 01:53:12,368
Can I. Uh...

1902
01:53:12,436 --> 01:53:14,904
Can I get you something?

1903
01:53:17,007 --> 01:53:18,474
I don't...

1904
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:20,510
What did you say?

1905
01:53:24,681 --> 01:53:26,979
Calvin. What did you say?

1906
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:28,574
[Sighing]

1907
01:53:31,521 --> 01:53:33,716
Tell me.

1908
01:53:40,364 --> 01:53:41,831
You are beautiful.

1909
01:53:45,435 --> 01:53:47,926
And you are unpredictable.

1910
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,008
But you're so cautious.

1911
01:53:54,611 --> 01:53:56,044
You're determined. Beth...

1912
01:53:56,113 --> 01:53:58,240
but you know something?

1913
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:02,142
You're not strong.

1914
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:07,519
I don't know
if you're really giving.

1915
01:54:10,694 --> 01:54:12,184
Tell me something.

1916
01:54:12,262 --> 01:54:14,355
Do you love me?

1917
01:54:16,466 --> 01:54:18,934
Do you really love me?

1918
01:54:21,305 --> 01:54:25,139
I feel the way I've always
felt about you.

1919
01:54:37,754 --> 01:54:40,222
We would've been all right...

1920
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:43,782
if there hadn't been any mess.

1921
01:54:45,395 --> 01:54:47,863
But you can't handle mess.

1922
01:54:49,466 --> 01:54:52,924
You need everything neat and easy.

1923
01:54:54,037 --> 01:54:55,504
I don't know.

1924
01:54:55,572 --> 01:54:58,040
Maybe you can't love anybody.

1925
01:54:58,108 --> 01:55:00,576
It was so much Buck.

1926
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:05,638
It's as if you buried
all your love with him.

1927
01:55:05,716 --> 01:55:07,684
I don't understand that.

1928
01:55:09,286 --> 01:55:12,778
Maybe it wasn't even Buck.

1929
01:55:12,856 --> 01:55:15,256
Maybe it was just you.

1930
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:20,957
Maybe, finally, it was
the best of you that you buried.

1931
01:55:23,533 --> 01:55:25,501
But whatever it was...

1932
01:55:29,139 --> 01:55:32,108
I don't know who you are.

1933
01:55:32,175 --> 01:55:36,669
I don't know what
we've been playing at.

1934
01:55:39,282 --> 01:55:41,409
So I was crying.

1935
01:55:45,922 --> 01:55:49,983
Because I don't know
if I love you anymore.

1936
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:57,524
And I don't know
what I'll do without that.

1937
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:28,222
[Door Slams]

1938
01:58:28,785 --> 01:58:29,877
Dad?

1939
01:58:33,123 --> 01:58:36,115
The yard looks smaller
without leaves.

1940
01:58:37,694 --> 01:58:39,161
Dad. What happened?

1941
01:58:41,264 --> 01:58:44,756
Your mother's
going away for a while.

1942
01:58:44,834 --> 01:58:45,994
Where?

1943
01:58:46,069 --> 01:58:47,297
Why?

1944
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:48,837
Back to Houston.

1945
01:58:49,906 --> 01:58:51,373
I don't know.

1946
01:58:52,475 --> 01:58:53,908
Why? What...

1947
01:58:56,012 --> 01:58:57,479
I know why.

1948
01:58:57,547 --> 01:58:59,515
It's me. Isn't it?

1949
01:58:59,583 --> 01:59:00,550
No.

1950
01:59:00,617 --> 01:59:02,050
It's my fault.

1951
01:59:02,118 --> 01:59:04,382
Don't do that to yourself!

1952
01:59:04,454 --> 01:59:05,887
It's nobody's fault!

1953
01:59:05,956 --> 01:59:09,357
Things happen.
People don't always have answers.

1954
01:59:13,163 --> 01:59:16,963
I don't know why
I'm yelling at you.

1955
01:59:17,033 --> 01:59:20,127
You should do
that more often.

1956
01:59:20,203 --> 01:59:21,932
Haul my ass a little.

1957
01:59:22,005 --> 01:59:23,438
Get after me.

1958
01:59:25,775 --> 01:59:27,611
Like you did for him.

1959
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,211
He needed it.

1960
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:30,211
You didn't.

1961
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:33,215
You were always
so hard on yourself.

1962
01:59:33,283 --> 01:59:35,615
I never had the heart.

1963
01:59:35,685 --> 01:59:38,210
Oh. Dad. Don't.

1964
01:59:38,288 --> 01:59:40,518
Well. It's the truth.

1965
01:59:42,292 --> 01:59:44,726
I never worried about you.

1966
01:59:44,794 --> 01:59:47,729
I just wasn't listening.

1967
01:59:48,865 --> 01:59:51,095
I wasn't sending
many signals then.

1968
01:59:51,167 --> 01:59:53,067
You couldn't do anything.

1969
01:59:53,136 --> 01:59:56,697
I should've got
a handle on it somehow.

1970
02:00:01,811 --> 02:00:05,747
I used to figure you had
a handle for everything.

1971
02:00:05,815 --> 02:00:08,045
You knew it all.

1972
02:00:08,118 --> 02:00:12,111
You always made us feel
everything would be all right.

1973
02:00:13,189 --> 02:00:16,158
I've thought about that
a lot lately.

1974
02:00:16,226 --> 02:00:18,694
I really admire you for it.

1975
02:00:18,762 --> 02:00:20,753
Don't admire people too much.

1976
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:23,924
They'll disappoint you sometimes.

1977
02:00:25,068 --> 02:00:26,933
I'm not disappointed.

1978
02:00:30,106 --> 02:00:32,676
I love you.

1979
02:00:38,281 --> 02:00:39,714
I love you. Too.
