A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release

1
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,700
Do you have any idea what they were arguing about?

2
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,700
Do you speak English? 

3
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,100
Yeah. No, I'm sorry, my German is not very good

4
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,400
Have you ever heard that as couples get older,
they lose their ability to hear each other? 

5
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,000
No

6
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Well, supposedly, men lose the ability
to hear higher-pitched sounds

7
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,600
and women eventually lose hearing in the low end

8
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,700
I guess they sort of nullify 
each other, or something. 

9
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,600
I guess. Nature's way of allowing couples
to grow old together without killing each other.

10
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,700
What are you reading?

11
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, yeah.

12
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,000
How bout you?

13
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,400
Look, I was thinking about going to the
lounge car sometime soon. Would you like to come with me? 

14
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah.

15
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay

16
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,900
So how do you speak such good English? 

17
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,600
I went to school for a summer in Los Angeles.

18
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,500
This fine here? 
Yeah, this is good.

19
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,300
Then I spent some time in London.

20
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,300
How do you speak such good English? 

21
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,900
Me? I'm American.

22
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,400
You're American? 
Yeah.

23
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,300
Are you sure? 
Yeah.

24
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,300
No, I'm joking.

25
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,100
I knew you were American. 

26
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,600
And of course, you don't speak any 
other language, right? 

27
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,500
Yeah, yeah, I get it

28
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,800
So I'm the crude, dumb, vulgar American who
has no culture, right?

29
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
But, I tried

30
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,600
I took french for four years in high 
school. When I first got to Paris, I 
stood in line at the Métro station.

31
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I was practicing. 'Un billet, s'il vous
plaît. Un billet s'il vous plaît' y'know 

32
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
"un billet"

33
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,000
Whatever. 'Un, Un.' 'Un billet s'il vous
plaît, un billet s'il vous plaît,' y'know,

34
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,100
and I get up there, and, uh, I look at 
this woman, and my mind goes completely
blank. And I start saying,

35
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,100
'uh, listen, uh, I need a ticket to get to...
y'know so anyway.

36
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,900
So, where are you headed? 

37
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,400
Well, back to Paris.

38
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,900
My classes start next week.

39
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,800
Oh, you're still in school? Where do you go? 

40
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,800
-Yeah, La Sorbonne, you know? 
-Well, sure

41
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Hey, you coming from Budapest?

42
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,500
Yeah, I was visiting my grandmother. 

43
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Oh. How's she? 

44
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,200
She's okay. 

45
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,100
-She's alright?
-She's fine, yeah

46
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,100
How bout you? Where are you going? 

47
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,400
Uh, I'm going to Vienna.

48
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,300
Vienna? What's there?

49
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,500
Uh, I have no idea. I'm flying out of there tomorrow. 

50
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,700
Ah ha. you on holiday? 

51
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,700
Uh, I don't really know what I'm on. 
I've just been. I'm just traveling around,

52
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,400
I've been riding the trains the past two, three weeks. 

53
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,900
You were visiting friends, or just on your own? 

54
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,200
Uh, yeah. Y'know I had a friend in Madrid, but, umm..

55
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,100
-Madrid? That's nice.
-Yeah, I got one of those Eurail passes, is what I did.

56
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,500
-That's great. So, has this trip, around Europe, 
been good for you? 
-Yeah, sure, yeah,

57
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,000
-it's been, umm... it sucked. Y'know... 
-What?

58
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,800
No, uh, it's had its, umm. Well, I'll tell you,
y'know, sitting, 

59
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,600
y'know, for weeks on end, looking out the window 
has actually been kinda great. 

60
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,400
What do you mean? 

61
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,500
Well, you know, for instance, you have ideas
that you ordinarily wouldn't have. 

62
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,000
-What kind of ideas? 
-You want to hear one?

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,700
-Yeah, tell me.
-Alright, uh,  

64
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,900
I had this idea, okay? 

65
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,500
For a television show. Some friends of mine 
are these cable access producers, do you know 
what that is, cable access?

66
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,800
I don't know, I dunno... Anybody can produce a show
real cheap, and they have to put it on. Right?

67
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,700
And I have this idea for this show that would 
last 24 hours a day for a year straight, right?

68
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,800
What you do, is you get 365 people from cities
all over the world,

69
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,300
to do these 24 hour documents of real time, right, 
capturing life as its lived.

70
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:32,100
Um, you know, it would start with uh, a guy
waking up in the morning, and, uh, y'know,
taking the long shower,

71
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,300
eating a little breakfast, making a little 
coffee, you know, and, uh, reading the paper. 

72
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,100
Wait, wait. All those mundane, boring things
everybody has to do everyday of their fucking life?

73
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,200
-I was going to say the poetry of day to day 
life, but you know, you say the way you say 
it, I'll say it the way I say it... 

74
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,700
... No listen, think about it like this... 
-Who's gonna want to watch this? 

75
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,900
Well, alright, think about it like this. Why is it, 
that a dog, y'know, sleeping in the sun, is so beautiful, 
y'know, it is, its beautiful, y'know,

76
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,400
but a guy, standing at a bank machine, trying to take some 
money out, looks like a complete moron? 

77
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,900
-So, its like a National Geographic program, but on people? 
-Yeah! 

78
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,100
What do you think?

79
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah, I can, I can, I can see it. Like twenty four boring hours, 
sorry, and like a three minute sex scene, 

80
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,700
where he falls asleep right after, no?

81
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,500
Yeah, y'know I mean, and... I mean, that would be a great episode.
-Yeah.

82
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,600
People would talk about that episode.

83
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,000
-I mean, you and your friends could do one in Paris, 
if you wanted to, I mean.
-Oh, sure.

84
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,500
I dunno, the key, the key.. the thing that kind of haunts me
is the distribution, y'know.

85
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:41,900
I mean, getting these tapes from town to town, city to city, 
so that the play is continuous, cause it would have to play all 
the time, or else it just wouldn't work. 

86
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,600
-Tkank you 
-Tkanks

87
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,300
You know what? Not service oriented

88
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,300
an observation about Europe.

89
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,900
You know my parents have never really spoken of the possibility 
of my falling in love, or getting married, or having children.

90
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,500
Even as a little girl, they wanted me to think of 
a future career, as a, you know,

91
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,400
 as a interior designer, or a lawyer, or something like that

92
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,700
I'd say to my dad, 'I want to be a writer.' and he'd say journalist.

93
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,300
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats, and he'd say veterinarian.

94
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,200
 I'd say I wanted to be an actress, and he'd say TV newscaster

95
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:40,400
It was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambition 
into these practical, money-making ventures. 

96
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,100
I always had a pretty good bullshit detector when I was a kid, y'know.

97
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,200
I always knew when they were lying to me, y'know.

98
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,600
By the time I was in high school, I was dead set on listening 
to what everybody thought I should be doing with my life,

99
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,200
and just kind of doing just the opposite. 

100
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:05,000
No one was ever mean about it. Its just, I could never get 
very excited about other people's ambitions for my life. 

101
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:13,500
But you know what, if your parents never really fully contradict
you about anything, and like are basically nice, and supportive...
-Right... 

102
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,900
It makes it even harder to officially complain. Y'know, even when they're wrong,

103
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,700
its this, its this passive-aggressive shit, you know what I mean

104
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,600
its... I hate it,

105
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,200
I really hate it. 

106
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Well, you know, despite all that kind of bullshit that comes along with it

107
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,400
I remember childhood as this

108
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
you know, this magical time

109
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,700
I remember when, uh, my mother first told me about death

110
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:51,400
My great-grandmother had just died, and my whole family had just 
visited them in Florida. I was about 3, 3 and a half years old

111
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,300
Anyway, I was in the backyard, playing

112
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,600
and my sister had just taught me how to take the garden hose

113
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,200
and do it in such a way that, uh, you could spray it 
into the sun, and you could make a rainbow, right?

114
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,300
And so I was doing that,

115
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,500
and through the mist I could see my grandmother

116
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,500
And she was just standing there, smiling at me

117
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,300
And uh, then I held it there, for a long time

118
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,500
and I looked at her. And then finally, I let go of the nozzle,

119
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,600
 y'know, and then I dropped the hose, and she disappeared

120
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
And so I went back inside, and I tell my parents

121
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,000
And they, uh, sit me down give me big rap

122
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,700
on how when people die you never see them again
and how I'd imagined it

123
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,700
But, I knew what I'd seen. And I was just glad that I saw that. 
I mean, I've never seen anything like that since

124
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,700
But, I don't know

125
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,900
It just kind of let me know how ambiguous everything was

126
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,300
y'know, even death. 

127
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,700
You're really lucky you can have this attitude towards death

128
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,800
I think I'm afraid of death 24 hours a day. I swear

129
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,500
-I mean, that's why I'm in a train right now. 
I could have flown to Paris, but I'm too scared. 
-Oh, come. 

130
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,600
I can't help it. I can't help it

131
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,500
I know the statistics say na-na-na, its safer whatever.

132
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:22,300
 When I'm in a plane, I can see it. 
I can see the explosion. I can see me falling through the clouds

133
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:28,300
and I'm so scared of those few seconds of 
consciousness before you're gonna die

134
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,400
you know, when you know for sure you're gonna die

135
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I can't stop thinking that way

136
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
-Its exhausting
-Yeah, I bet

137
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,900
Really exhausting

138
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,500
-I think this is Vienna
-Yeah. 

139
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,200
-You get off here, no?
-Yeah, what a drag

140
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,900
I wish I had met you earlier, you know, I really like talking to you

141
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,900
Yeah, me too

142
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,400
It was really nice to meet you

143
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,500
Alright, I have an admittedly insane idea, but if I don't ask you this

144
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,900
its just, uh, you know, its gonna haunt me the rest of my life
-What? 

145
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Um... I want to keep talking to you, y'know. 
I have no idea what your situation is, but, uh,

146
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,300
but I feel like we have some kind of, uh, connection. Right? 

147
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,700
Yeah, me too.

148
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,100
Yeah, right,

149
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,100
-well, great. So listen, so here's the deal. This is what we should do. 
You should get off the train with me here in Vienna, and come check out the capital. 
-What?

150
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
Come on. It'll be fun. Come on

151
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,500
What would we do?

152
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,500
Umm, I don't know. All I know is I have to catch an 
Austrian Airlines flight tomorrow morning at 9:30

153
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,300
and I don't really have enough money for a hotel, 
so I was just going to walk around,

154
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,600
and it would be a lot more fun if you came with me

155
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
And if I turn out to be some kind of psycho, you know, 
you just get on the next train.

156
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,200
Alright, alright. Think of it like this

157
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,700
jump ahead, ten, twenty years, okay, and you're married

158
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,500
Only your marriage doesn't have that 
same energy that it used to have, y'know

159
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
You start to blame your husband

160
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,800
You start to think about all those guys you've met in your life

161
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,400
and what might have happened if you'd 
picked up with one of them, right?

162
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,700
Well, I'm one of those guys. That's me

163
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,600
y'know, so think of this as time travel, from then, to now,

164
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,900
to find out what you're missing out on
See, what this really could be

165
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,800
is a gigantic favour 
to both you and your future husband

166
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,400
to find out that you're not missing out on anything. 
I'm just as big a loser as he is

167
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,600
totally unmotivated, totally boring, and, uh, 
you made the right choice, and you're really happy

168
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
Let me get my bag.

169
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,300
-We should get a locker for all this stuff
-ok

170
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,700
What's your name? 

171
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,800
My name?

172
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Es Jess
It's Jesse. It's James, actually, 
but everybody always calls me Jesse

173
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,100
You mean, Jesse James? No. 

174
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,300
-No, no. Just Jesse
-I'm Celine

175
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,200
Nice bridge

176
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Yeah.

177
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,900
-This is kind of weird
-Yeah, this is kind of weird isn't it? 
I mean, I feel a little awkward

178
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
But its alright, right? Its okay.

179
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,100
Yeah, this is great, this is great. Let's go to some places. 
Look at your book.

180
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,400
Yeah, we're in Vienna, let's go to some places. 
Let's ask these guys 

181
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,900
Excuse me, excuse me,

182
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,700
spreken-ze English?

183
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,300
Ja, of course. 

184
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,500
Couldn't you speak German for a change? 

185
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
-What? 
-No, it was a joke. 

186
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,400
Well, listen, we just got into Vienna today, 
and we're looking for something fun to do

187
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,300
Like museums, exhibitions, things... 

188
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,200
But museums are not that funny any more these days, uh... 

189
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,300
Uh, but they are closing right now. 

190
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
How long are you going to be here?

191
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,900
Just for tonight.

192
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Why did you come to Vienna?
What, uh, what could you be expecting?

193
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,900
We're on honeymoon. 

194
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,800
Yeah, she got pregnant, we had to get married, y'know. 

195
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,200
You know I don't believe you, you're a bad liar. 

196
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,300
This is a play we're both in, and we would like to invite you. 

197
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,600
You're actors? 

198
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,200
No, not professional actors, uh, part-time actors, for fun.

199
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,800
It's a play about a cow, and an Indian searching for it.

200
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,800
-There are also in it politicians, Mexicans...
-Russians, Communists,

201
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,100
So, you have a real cow on stage. 

202
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,600
No, not a real cow. Its an actor in a cow costume.

203
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,600
And he's the cow.
Yes, I am the cow. And the cow is a bit weird. 

204
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,400
She's acting a bit strange, like a dog.

205
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:50,600
If someone throws a stick, she fetches it, and brings it back. 
And she can smoke, with her hooves, and everything. 

206
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,200
And as you see, there is the address. Its in the Second district. 

207
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,300
Near the Prata. You know the Prata? 

208
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,500
-Oh, the big Ferris Wheel?
-By the wheel, yes. 

209
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,400
-Oh, we should go.
-Yes, the wheel, everybody knows the wheel.

210
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,500
Perhaps you can go to the Prata before the play. It starts at 21:30. 

211
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,100
¿21'30?

212
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,700
-That's 9:30.
-9:30? oh, right, right. Okay, great, well,

213
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,600
what's the name of this play? 

214
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
It translates as 'Bring me the horns ...

215
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,600
... of Wilmington's cow'

216
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Ja I'm Wilmington's cow.

217
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,100
 -Alright 
-Great

218
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,600
-You'll be there?
-We'll try  

219
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,100
-I'm the cow.
-You're the cow.
-Goodbye

220
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,900
Alright, I got an idea. Are you ready? 

221
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay.

222
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,700
Q&A time. We've known each other a little while now, 
we're stuck together, so we're going to ask each other a few, 
uh, direct questions. Alright? 

223
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,000
So, we ask each other questions.

224
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,300
-And you have to answer 100% honestly.
-Of course.

225
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,600
Okay, alright, first question

226
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,400
-You
-Describe for me...Yes, I'm going to ask you.

227
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,100
Describe for me your first sexual feelings towards a person. 

228
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,700
My first sexual feelings, oh my God.

229
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,400
Um, I know, I know. Jean-Marc Floris.

230
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,100
Jean-Marc Floris?

231
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,100
I remember we were at this summer camp together. And he was a swimmer.

232
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Yeah, he had bleached out chlorine hair and green eyes. 
And to improve his times, he'd shave the hair off his legs and arms.

233
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,900
-That's disgusting
-Oh, no. He was like this gorgeous dolphin. 
And my friend Emma had a big, big crush on him

234
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,000
So one day I was cutting, y'know across field, back to my room, 

235
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,100
and he came walking up beside me

236
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
You know, and I told him, you know,

237
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,800
you should date Emma,

238
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,600
she has a big crush on you.

239
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,100
And he turned to me and said

240
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,100
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I have a big crush on you.

241
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Yeah, it really scared the hell out of me, 
because I thought he was so fine.

242
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,400
And then he officially asked me out on a date, and y'know 

243
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,900
I pretended I didn't like him

244
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,100
Y'know I was, I was so afraid of what I might do, you know.

245
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,800
Uh, well. So, y'know, I went to see him swim a few times, 
at the swim competition. And he was so sexy, really, I mean, really sexy

246
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,300
Y'know we kind of wrote these little declarations of love 
to each other at the end of the summer, and you know,

247
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,300
promised we would keep writing forever, and I, 
y'know, meet again very soon, and 

248
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,300
Did you?

249
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,900
Of course not. 

250
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,900
Well, then I think this is the opportune time to tell 
you that I happen to be a fantastic swimmer. 

251
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
-Really? 
-Yeah. 

252
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,100
-I'll make note of that.
-Okay. Uh..

253
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,900
-So its my turn, no? 
-Yes, yeah, it's your turn. 

254
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,500
Yeah, yeah

255
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,800
Uh, have you ever been in love? 

256
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yes. Next question. What was the first...
Wait, wait.

257
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,400
-So I can give one word answers?
-Sure, why not?

258
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,000
No, no. After I went into such private details 
about my first sexual feelings. 

259
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,200
Yeah, I, I know, but, sexual feel... 
Those are two very different questions

260
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,300
I mean, I could've answered the sexual feelings thing, 
no problem, but y'know, love...

261
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,200
Well, what if I asked you about love? 

262
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,900
-I would have lied
-Yeah, well, you would have lied. Great.
-but at least, you know, I would have made up a great story. 

263
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:26,200
I mean, love is a complex issue. Y'know, I mean, 
its like, uh. I mean, yes, I had told somebody that 
I love them before, and I had meant it

264
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:34,000
Was it totally a totally unselfish, giving love?
Was it a beautiful thing? Not really

265
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
y'know. Its like love, I mean, uh, I don't know. Y'know? 

266
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,200
Yeah, I know what you mean.

267
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,600
But as far as sexual feelings go, I'll have you know it started with

268
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,600
an obsessive relationship with Miss July 1978. 
Do you know Playboy magazine?

269
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,600
Oh, yeah, I've heard of it.

270
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,500
-Yeah? Do you know Crystal? 
-No..

271
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
You don't know Crystal? Well, I knew Crystal.

272
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,900
Is it, um... my turn now. okay.

273
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,900
Tell me something that really pisses you off

274
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,800
really drives you crazy. 

275
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,000
-Pisses me off. My G-d. Everything pisses me off
-Okay, okay, list a couple.

276
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,300
Uh, okay. I hate being told by a strange man, 
a strange man in the street,

277
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,700
y'know, like, to smile, like, to make them feel 
better about their boring life,

278
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,600
um, what else?

279
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,300
I hate, I hate that 300 kms from here

280
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,100
there's a war going on, y'know, people are dying

281
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,400
and nobody knows what to do about it, or they 
don't give a shit, I don't know

282
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,600
I hate that the medias, you know, they are trying to control our minds.

283
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,500
The media? 
Yeah, the media.

284
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,600
You know its very subtle, but you know, 
its a new form of fascism.

285
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,800
Um, I hate, I hate when I am in foreign countries, 
especially in America, they are the worst.

286
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,900
Each time I wear black, or like, lose my temper, 
or say anything about anything, they always go 'oh, 
its so french, its so cute.'

287
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,000
I hate that I can't stand that, really. 

288
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,600
Is that all? 

289
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,400
Well, there's a lot of things, really. 

290
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,900
-So its my turn.
-Okay

291
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,300
You're going to answer

292
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,900
Yes, I'll answer. 

293
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,700
Ah, what's a problem for you? 

294
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,200
You, probably.

295
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,000
What?

296
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,800
Um, No, Alright, I had a thought the other day 
that was kind of, a, qualifies as a problem

297
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,500
What is it?

298
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,800
Well, it was a thought I had on the train, so.... Um... 
okay, alright. Um, Do you believe in reincarnation?

299
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,700
Yeah, yeah, its interesting.

300
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Most people, you know, a lot of people talk about the past lives, 
and things like that, 

301
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,400
you know, and even if they don't believe in it in some specific way,

302
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,700
you know, people have some kind of notion of an eternal soul, right.
-Yeah

303
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,800
Okay. Well, this is my thought. 50,000 years ago,

304
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,200
there are not even a million people on the planet

305
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,500
10,000 years ago, there's like 2,000,000 people on the planet. 
Now, there's between 5 and 6 billion people on the planet, right?

306
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,200
Now, if we all have our own, like, individual, 
unique soul, right, where do they all come from?

307
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,100
Are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls? 

308
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,800
Because if they are, that represents a 5,000-to-1 
split of each soul in just the last 50,000 years

309
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,000
which is like a blip in the earth's time.

310
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You know, so, at best, we're like these tiny 
fractions of people, you know, walking...

311
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,600
I mean, is that why we're all so scattered?

312
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,000
Y'know, Is that why we're all so specialized? 

313
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,300
-Wait a minute, I'm not sure I .. I don't....
-Hang on, I know, I know, its a totally scattered thought,

314
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,000
-which is kind of why it makes sense. 
-Yeah... I agree with you.

315
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,200
Let's get off this damn tram

316
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
This place is pretty neat. 

317
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Yeah, there's even a listening booth over there.

318
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
Have you ever heard of this singer? 

319
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,300
I think she's American. A friend of mine told me about her.

320
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,700
Do you want to go see if that listening booth still works? 

321
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, okay.

322
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,900
"There's a wind that blows in from the north,

323
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,700
And it says that loving takes its course.

324
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:31,500
Come here.

325
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,300
No I'm not impossible to touch, 

326
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,000
I have never wanted you so much.

327
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,300
Come here.

328
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,900
Have I never lay down by your side?

329
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,900
Baby, let's forget about this pride.

330
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:10,200
Come here.

331
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,100
Well, I'm in no hurry.

332
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,700
You don't have to run away this time.

333
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,400
I know that you're jimmied,

334
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,400
but it's gonna be all right this time

335
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,900
Oh, look, there's a rabbit. 

336
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,600
Yeah. Hey there, rabbit.

337
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,900
He's so cute

338
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,400
I visited this as a young teenager.

339
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,500
I think it left a bigger impression on me at that 
time than any of the museums we went to.

340
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,400
Yeah? Its tiny.

341
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,000
I know. There was this little old man that talked to us.
He was the grounds keeper.

342
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,900
He explained that most of the people are buried 
here that washed up on the bank of the Danube. 

343
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
How old are these? 

344
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,100
Around the beginning of the century or so.

345
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:33,400
It's called the cemetery of the no-name because the often 
didn't know who these people were. Maybe a first name, that's all. 

346
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,900
Why were all the bodies washing up?

347
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,800
I think some were from accidents, on boats and things like that

348
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,900
but most of them were suicides that jumped in the river.

349
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I always liked the idea of all those unknown people lost in the world.

350
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,400
When I was a little girl, I thought that if none of your family or 
friends knew you were dead, then its like not really being dead.

351
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,500
People can invent the best and the worst for you.

352
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Ah, here she is, I think. Yeah, this is, this is the one I remember the most.

353
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,600
She was only 13 when she died.

354
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,900
That meant something to me, you know, I was around 
that age when I first saw this

355
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Hmm. Now, I'm 10 years older, and she's still, 13, I guess.

356
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,400
That's funny.

357
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,400
That's the Danube over there.

358
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,400
That's the river, right? 
-Yeah. 

359
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,500
This is gorgeous

360
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Yeah, its very beautiful.

361
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,400
We got, uh, we got a sunset here. 
-Yeah

362
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,500
We got the Ferris wheel. 

363
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,700
It seems like, um, this would be a... 

364
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,400
-What? 
-Uh, you know, uh.

365
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,300
Are you trying to say you want to kiss me? 

366
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,500
-But you know what? 
-What? 

367
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,000
I don't think it really matters what generation you are born into.

368
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,800
Look at my parents.They were these angry, young, 
May '68 people, revolting against everything. 

369
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You know, the government, their conservative catholic backgrounds,

370
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,200
I mean. I was born not 
long after, and then my father went on to become this 
successful architect, and they began to travel all around the world,

371
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:20,200
where he built bridges, and towers, and stuff. I mean, 
I really can't complain about anything.

372
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,100
You know, they love me more than 
anything in the world, and I have been raised with 
all the freedom they had fought for

373
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,300
And yet for me now, its another type of fight

374
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,500
We still have to deal with the same old shit

375
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,100
but we can't really

376
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,500
know who, or y'know, what the enemy is.

377
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,300
I don't really know if there is an enemy.

378
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,600
You know, I mean, everybody's parents fuck them up.

379
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,100
You know, rich kids' parents gave them too much, 
poor kids' not enough.

380
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,100
Too much attention, not enough attention.

381
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,600
They either left them, or y'know, they stuck around 
and taught 'em the wrong things. Y'know.

382
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,500
I mean, my parents are just these two people who 
didn't like each other very much

383
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,800
who, uh, decided to get married and have a kid,

384
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,300
and they try their best to be nice to me. 

385
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,300
-Did your parents divorce? 
-Yeah.Finally

386
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,600
They should have done it a lot sooner, but they stuck together 
for a while for the well-being of my sister and I, thank you very much.

387
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,700
I remember my mother once. She told me, right in front 
of my father, they were having this big fight, 

388
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,900
that he didn't really want to have me,

389
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,600
y'know, that he was really pissed off when he found 
out that she was pregnant with me,

390
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,000
y'know, that I was this big mistake.

391
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,300
And I think that really shaped the way I think. I always saw 
the world as this place where I really wasn't meant to be.

392
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,900
-That's so sad. 
-No, I mean,

393
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,700
I eventually kind of took pride in it.

394
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,200
Y'know, like my life was my own doing, or something

395
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,200
-Y'know, like I was crashing 'The Big Party.' 
-That's a way to see it.

396
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,600
Y'know, my parents, they're still married, 
and I guess they're very happy

397
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,600
but I just think its an healthy process to rebel 
against everything that came before.

398
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:01,000
You know, I've been wondering lately. Do you know 
anyone who's in a happy relationship? 

399
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Uh, yeah, sure. Y'know, I know happy couples. 

400
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,200
But I think they lie to each other. 

401
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,700
Hmf. Yeah. 

402
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,800
People can lead their life as I lie.

403
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,800
My grandmother, she was married to this man, and I always 
thought she had a very simple, uncomplicated love life.

404
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,300
But she just confessed to me that she spent her whole life dreaming

405
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,300
about another man she was always in love with. 
She just accepted her fate.

406
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,700
It's so sad.

407
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:36,000
And in the same time, I love the idea that she had all 
those emotions and feelings I never thought she would have had. 

408
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,500
I guarantee you, it was better that way.

409
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,200
If she'd ever got to know him,'know, 
I'm sure he would have disappointed her eventually. 

410
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
How do you know? You don't know them. 

411
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Yeah, I know, I know. It's just, people have these romantic 
projections they put on everything. Y'know. that's not 
based on any kind of reality.

412
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,200
-Romantic projections? 
-Yeah. 

413
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:58,000
Oh, Mr. Romantic, up there in the Ferris Wheel
Oh, kiss me, the sunset, oh, its so beautiful. 

414
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Oh, alright, alright, alright. Tell me about your grandmother. 
What were you saying about her? 

415
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,300
Hey... check these guys out.

416
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,300
'Hey Hans, I have a confession to make.

417
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,100
I'm not wearing any underwear underneath this thing

418
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,200
'Oh really?' 'Does that frighten you?

419
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
-Can I tell you a secret? 
-Yeah. 

420
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,200
-Come here
-What?

421
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
-Look at this palm-reader.She's interesting-looking, no? 
-Yeah. 

422
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,900
-Uh-oh, uh-oh. 
-What, what?

423
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,600
-I just made eye contact.
-She's not coming over here. 

424
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,600
-Yes, she is. 
-Oh, shit. Oh, no. 

425
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,200
-Oh my God. You want your palm read? 

426
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,200
-No, no.
-No? Are you sure? 
-I'm sure. 

427
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
-Would you like your hand read? (aleman)
-Uh, français, English? 

428
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Vant your palm read? 

429
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,300
Yeah. How much is it.

430
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,000
For you, fifties. Okay? 

431
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Okay. 

432
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:52,500
Oh, so, you have been on a journey, and you are stranger to this place.

433
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,200
You, an adventure, you seek.

434
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
An adventure in your mind.

435
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,200
You are interested in the power of the woman,

436
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,200
in a woman's deep strength, and creativity? 

437
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
You are becoming this woman.

438
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,600
You need to resign yourself to the awkwardness of life.

439
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,200
Only if you find peace within yourself,

440
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,600
will you find true connection with others.

441
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,800
That is a stranger to you? 

442
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,700
I guess so.

443
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,200
Oh, you will be alright.
He's learning. 

444
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,600
Okay. Money.

445
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,300
You are both stars, don't forget.

446
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,500
And the stars exploded billions of years ago,

447
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,400
to form everything that is this world.

448
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,200
Everything we know, 

449
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,000
is stardust. So don't forget, you are stardust. 

450
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,200
I mean, that's very nice and all, I mean, that, y'know, we're all stardust

451
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,100
and you're becoming this great woman, I mean,

452
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:37,000
but I hope you don't take that any more seriously than 
some horoscope in a daily syndicated newspaper.

453
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,600
You, what are you talking about?

454
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,500
I mean, she knew I was on vacation,and that we didn't know 
each other, and that I was going to become this great woman. 

455
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,200
But what was that 'I am learning' bullshit? 

456
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,900
I mean, that's way condescending.Y'know.

457
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,500
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

458
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,200
I mean, if opportunists like that, ever had to tell the real 
truth, it would put their asses out of business. Y'know. I mean, just once,

459
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,300
I'd love to see, some little old lady

460
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,600
save up all her money, y'know, to go to the fortune teller,

461
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,900
and she'd get there, all excited about hearing 
her future, and the woman would say

462
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,000
UmHmm. Tomorrow, and all your remaining days

463
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,400
will be exactly like today

464
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,900
A tedious collection of hours. And you will have 
no new passions, and no new thoughts and no new travels,

465
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,900
and when you die, you'll be completely forgotten.

466
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,200
50 shillings, please.

467
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,900
Y'know, that, I'd like to see. 

468
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,900
Its so funny how she almost didn't notice you, y'know. It's weird. I wonder why. 

469
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,800
She was, she was really wise, and intense, no? 

470
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,900
I really loved what she said, you know? 

471
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,500
Yeah, of course you do, y'know. You pay your money, 
you get to hear something that makes you feel good about yourself.

472
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,100
If you want, maybe there's a seedy section of Vienna, we can go buy a hit of crack, 

473
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,000
y'know. Would you like that? Yeah? 

474
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,400
You're so 

475
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Stardust, Stardust. 

476
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,100
Ridicule!

477
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,800
Ah, there's an exhibition. 

478
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Yeah, I guess we'll miss it. Doesn't start until next week. 

479
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Yeah, I think so

480
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
I actually saw this one a few years ago in a museum

481
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,100
I stared, and stared at it. Must have been 45 minutes

482
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,600
I love it. La voie ferée. Ah

483
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,300
I love the way the people seem to be dissolving into the background

484
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,400
Look at this one. 

485
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,000
Its like the environments, y'know, 

486
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,400
are stronger than the people.

487
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,000
His human figures are always so transitory. Its funny. 

488
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,800
Transitory? 

489
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Transitory

490
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,500
-Think this is open?
-I don't know, let's try it. 

491
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I was in an old church like this with my grandmother
 a few days ago in Budapest

492
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Even though I reject most of the religious things
I can't help but feeling for all those people 

493
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:05,300
that come here lost or in pain, guilt, 
looking for some kind of answers

494
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,900
It fascinates me how a single place can join so 
much pain and happiness for so many generations 

495
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,000
You close with your grandmother? 

496
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,500
Yeah

497
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,000
I think its because I always... 

498
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I always have this strange feeling that I am this very old woman laying down about to die.

499
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,200
You know, that my life is 

500
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,200
just her memories, or something. 

501
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,400
That's so wild. I mean, 

502
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,700
I always think that I'm still this 13 year old boy, y'know
 who just doesn't really know how to be an adult, pretending

503
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,700
to live my life, taking notes for when I'll really have to do it. 

504
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,600
Kind of like I'm in a dress rehearsal for a Junior High play. 

505
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,700
That's funny. 

506
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,500
Then, up there in the Ferris wheel, it was

507
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:08,200
-like this very old woman kissing this very young boy, right? 

508
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Do you know anything about the Quakers, the Quaker religion? 

509
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
No, not much, no. 

510
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Well, I went to this Quaker wedding once, and it was fantastic.

511
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:27,100
What they do is the couple comes in and they 
kneel down in front of the whole congregation,

512
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,100
and they just stare at each other,

513
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,100
and nobody says a word unless they feel that
 God moves them to speak, or say something. 

514
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,600
And then after an hour or so, of just, uh,

515
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,600
staring at each other, they're married. 

516
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,200
That's beautiful. I like that. 

517
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,500
This is a horrible story. 

518
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,200
What? 

519
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,100
Its not the appropriate place to tell it, but... 

520
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,800
What? 

521
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,700
Well, I was driving around with this buddy of mine,

522
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,700
he was a big atheist, and we came to a stop, next to this homeless guy.

523
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,900
And my buddy takes out a 100 dollar bill, and leans out the window, 

524
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,900
and he says, 'do you believe in God?' 

525
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:34,100
And the guy looks at, uh, he looks at my friend, and he looks at the money, 

526
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,500
he says, uh, 

527
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,500
'Yes, I do.' My friend says, 'Wrong answer.' , and we drove away. 

528
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,500
That's mean, no? 

529
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,500
Yeah, uh, its, uh 

530
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,900
Would you be in Paris by now, if uh,
 you hadn't gotten off the train with me? 

531
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,100
No not yet. What would you be doing? 

532
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,100
I'd probably be hanging around the airport, reading old magazines,
crying in my coffee cause you didn't come with me.

533
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,100
I'd probably be hanging around the airport, reading old magazines,
 crying in my coffee cause you didn't come with me. 

534
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,500
Actually, I think I'd probably have gotten off the train
 in Salsburg with someone else. 

535
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:25,300
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see. So, I'm just that dumb American
 momentarily decorating your bland canvass. 

536
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,600
I'm having a great time. 

537
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,300
Yeah? 

538
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,200
Yeah. 

539
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,700
Me too. 

540
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:39,400
I'm so glad because no one knows I'm here, and I don't know anyone that
 knows you that would tell me all those bad things you've done. 

541
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,600
Yeah. 

542
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,700
I'll tell you some.
Yeah, I'm sure. 

543
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:49,500
You know, you hear so much shit about people. 
I always feel like the general of an army when I start dating a guy, y'know, 

544
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:55,600
plotting my strategy and manoeuverings, knowing his weak points,
 what would hurt him, seduce him. 

545
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,800
It's horrible.

546
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,100
If we were around each other all the time, what do you think
 would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad? 

547
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,000
-No, uh, no, no, I'm not gonna answer this question, no.
-Why? 

548
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,800
I just, I dated this girl once who, who used to always ask me that question, 
'What about me bugs you?' y'know. 

549
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,900
And so finally I said, well, y'know, I, uh, 
just don't think you handle criticism too well. 

550
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,000
She flew into a rage, and broke up with me, alright. That's a true story.

551
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
All she ever really wanted to do was to have an excuse to tell me
 what she thought was wrong with me,

552
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,400
y'know. Is that what you want? 

553
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,200
What? 

554
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,100
Something about me bugs you? 

555
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,200
No. 

556
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,100
It's alright. Tell me. What is it? What about me bugs you? 

557
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,400
Nothing, nothing at all. 

558
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,000
Well, if it had to be something, what would it be? 

559
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,700
If it had to be something, if I had to think about it, I... 

560
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:48,600
I kind of didn't really like this reaction back at the palm reader. 
You were like this rooster prick. 

561
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:49,000
Rooster prick? 

562
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,700
Yeah. 

563
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,600
I was a rooster prick? 

564
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,600
You were like a little boy whining because 
all the attention wasn't focused on him. 

565
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,300
Alright, listen, this woman robs you blind, okay? 

566
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:04,500
You were like a little boy walking by an ice cream store, 
crying because his mother wouldn't buy him a milkshake or something. 

567
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,000
I don't care what this woman has to say about anything. 

568
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Hello?  

569
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
What? 

570
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,700
Oh, I understand a little bit, but he doesn't, I'm sorry. 

571
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,700
Okay, uh, so, um, may I ask you a question? 

572
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,300
Yeah. 

573
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:28,100
So, I would like to make a deal with you. 

574
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,100
I mean, instead of just asking you for money, I will ask you for a word. 

575
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,600
Yeah, You give me a word, I take the word, and then, and then I will write a poem,

576
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,000
with the word inside. 

577
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,400
And if you like it, I mean, if you like my poem, and you feel
 it adds something to your life in any way,

578
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,800
then you can pay me whatever you feel like. 

579
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,200
I will write in English, of course. 

580
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:53,900
Okay. 

581
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,900
Great, alright. 

582
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So? Pick a word. 

583
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Ummm... 

584
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,900
A word, uh... milkshake. 

585
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,900
Milkshake? oh, good. Yeah, was gonna say rooster prick, but great.  Milkshake. 

586
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,900
Milkshake? Okay, milkshake. 

587
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,700
Yeah, right, so we'll... 

588
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,700
Good. 

589
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,800
What can I say? I like this Viennese variation of a bum. 

590
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,300
I like what he said about adding something to your life, no? 

591
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,300
Yeah. So, uh, were we having our first fight back there? 

592
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,700
No... 

593
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,800
Yeah, I think so, I think we were. 

594
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,400
Well, even if we were a little bit, y'know. 
Why does everyone think conflict is so bad.

595
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,700
There's a lot of good things coming out of conflict. 

596
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,700
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

597
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:58,500
I don't know, y'know, I always think that if I could just accept 
the fact that my life was supposed to be difficult,

598
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,100
y'know that's what's to be expected, then, I might not get so pissed off about it, 

599
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,500
and I'd just be glad when something nice happens. 

600
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,200
Maybe that's why I'm still in school, y'know. 
Its easier to have something to fight against. 

601
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,200
Yeah, well, we've all had such competitiveness engrained in us... 

602
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,100
...You know, I could be doing the most nothing thing, y'know, I could be,

603
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,100
uh, throwing some darts, or shooting some pool, 
and all of a sudden, I feel it come over me, 

604
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,400
'I have got to win' 

605
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,800
Is that why you tried to get me off the train? Competitiveness? 

606
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,800
What do you mean? 

607
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,700
Okay. Look at the poem. 

608
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,100
Oh, alright.  

609
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,100
Will you read it to us? 

610
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,300
Sure, okay. 

611
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,100
Daydream delusion.

612
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,900
Limousine Eyelash

613
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,700
Oh, baby with your pretty face

614
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,600
Drop a tear in my wineglass

615
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,200
Look at those big eyes

616
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,800
See what you mean to me

617
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,900
Sweet cakes and milkshakes

618
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,300
I am a delusioned angel

619
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,800
I am a fantasy parade.

620
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,600
I want you to know what I think.

621
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Don't want you to guess anymore.

622
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,200
You have no idea where I came from.

623
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,700
We have no idea where we're going.

624
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,200
Launched in life. 

625
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,700
Like branches in the river.

626
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,000
Flowing downstream.

627
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,900
Caught in the current.

628
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,200
I'll carry you. You'll carry me.

629
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,100
That's how it could be.

630
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,600
Don't you know me 

631
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,600
Don't you know me by now.

632
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,100
Great. Thanks. 

633
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,100
Thanks, man

634
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,700
-Uh, Here you go, uh.
-Thanks. 

635
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,500
Thank you. 

636
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,200
Yeah, good luck, man. 

637
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,400
Bye. 

638
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
That's wonderful, no? 
Yeah, yeah. 

639
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,700
What? 

640
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:28,400
You know he probably didn't just write that. I mean, you know he wrote it, 
but he probably just plugs that word in, y'know, whatever 'milkshake'... 

641
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,200
What do you mean? 

642
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Nothing, I love it, it was great. 

643
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,400
You know what drives me crazy? 

644
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,100
What? 

645
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,800
Its all these people talking about how great technology is,
 and how it saves all this time.

646
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,800
But, what good is saved time, if nobody uses it?
 If it just turns into more busy work. 

647
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,400
Yeah. 

648
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:59,800
Right, I mean, you never hear somebody say, "Well, y'know, with, uh, the time 
I've saved by using my word processor, I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery 
and hang out." I mean, you never hear that. 

649
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,600
Time is so abstract anyway. 

650
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,500
Were you looking at this girl? 

651
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
What? What? 

652
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,500
Nothing. 

653
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,600
Do you want to go in here? 

654
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,200
What? 

655
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,200
Do you want to go in here? 

656
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,300
Yeah. Its a club, no? 

657
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,300
Yeah. 

658
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,000
-Wanna go?
-Yeah. 

659
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Allo. 

660
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,400
50 shillings. 

661
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,300
Each. 

662
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,200
I got a hundred. Here, I got it. 

663
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,200
I'll buy you a beer.Thank you. 

664
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,700
You gonna buy me a beer? 

665
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,700
Yeah

666
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,300
You think Ole Milwaukee's a little expensive here? 

667
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,600
Merde! 

668
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:55,500
Well, um, we haven't talked about this yet, but, are you dating anyone?

669
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,500
You got a boyfriend waiting on you back in Paris, or anything like that? 

670
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,400
No, not right now. 

671
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,300
not right but you did!  

672
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,200
We broke up about six months ago. 

673
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,100
Six months ago. 

674
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:07,700
Yeah. 

675
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,700
I'm sorry. I mean, I'm not that sorry. But, uh, tell me about it. 

676
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,800
Ah, no. No, no way, I can't. Its really, really boring. 

677
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,700
C'mon, tell me about it. 

678
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,000
Okay. I was really disappointed. 

679
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,100
I thought this one would last for a while. I mean he was 

680
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,700
very stupid, ugly, bad in bed, alcoholic, 

681
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,700
-y'know 
-Real prize-winner. 

682
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,000
Yeah.I was kind of giving him a favour, but

683
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
he left me, saying I loved him too much, and, y'know,

684
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I was blocking his artistic expression, or some shit like that, y'know. 

685
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,000
But anyway, I was traumatized, and became  

686
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,500
and became totally obsessed with him.

687
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,500
And so I went to see this shrink, y'know, and it came out that I had written this

688
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,700
little stupid story about this woman, trying to kill her boyfriend, and 

689
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,500
how she was gonna do it, y'know, with all the intricate details, of,

690
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
y'know, how to do it, and not get caught, and 

691
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,200
She was gonna kill her boyfriend? 

692
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,400
Yeah. 

693
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Yeah, she was. I mean, its nothing I would do, but it was just some writing, y'know. 

694
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,600
Alright, no, no, I understand. 

695
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,600
But anyway, this stupid shrink believed everything 
I was telling her, and it was my first time seeing her. 

696
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,200
She said she had to call the police. 

697
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,000
She had to call the police? 

698
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,700
Yeah. She was, merde! 

699
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,200
she was totally convinced I was really gonna do it. 

700
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,100
y'know, even though I'd explained to her it was just some writing, y'know. 

701
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:35,100
She said, looking deep into my eyes, "The way you said it, 
I know you are going to do it, the way you said it." 

702
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,300
She was totally out of her mind. It was my first and last session. 

703
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,800
Yeah, so what happened then? 

704
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:45,900
I totally got over him, you know.

705
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,900
But now I'm obsessed that he's gonna die from 
an accident, or, you know, 1000 kms away, 

706
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,300
I'm gonna be the one accused. 

707
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,400
Why do you become obsessed with people you don't 

708
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,500
really like that much, you know, I mean. 

709
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,200
I don't know. 

710
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,100
So, how about you? 

711
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,000
What? 

712
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,600
Are you with anyone? 

713
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,600
Umm, its funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long, isn't it? 

714
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,200
Yeah, but now you have to tell me. 

715
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:27,200
Well, I kind of see this all love as this, uh, 
escape for two people who don't know how to be alone, y'know, 

716
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:37,600
or, uh. I mean, y'know its funny. People always talk about how 
love is this totally unselfish, giving thing, but if you think about it, 
y'know, there's nothing more selfish. 

717
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,300
Yeah, I know. So,

718
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,300
she just broke up with you? 

719
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,900
What? 

720
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,300
You sound like you've just been hurt, or something. 

721
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,300
No.... do I? 

722
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:52,900
Yeah. 

723
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,300
Alright. Um,

724
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,000
Big confession, y'know. 

725
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I should have told you the earlier, or something, but,

726
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,900
y'know... I didn't just come to Europe just to 

727
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,400
hang out, and read Hemingway in Paris, and shit like that, y'know. 

728
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,400
I saved up my money all spring to, uh, fly to Madrid, and 

729
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,200
spend the summer with my girlfriend, who has been on this...

730
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,000
Your girlfriend? 

731
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
My EX-girlfriend, who has been on this asinine art history program for the last year.

732
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,900
Anyway, I got here, right, and now we're re-united, at long last, 
and we went out to dinner, our first night, 

733
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,300
ah, with six of her friends. 

734
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,300
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo, Maria, Suzie, from home, y'know. 

735
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,600
She pretty much managed to avoid being
alone with me for the first couple of days 
we were there, and I stuck around for a while, 

736
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,600
just to kind of let it really sink in that she wished I hadn't come. 

737
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,500
So I bought the cheapest flight out of Europe, this one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow, 

738
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,000
but it didn't leave for a couple of weeks. So, I bought this Eurail pass, y'know.

739
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,000
y'know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you? 

740
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,500
Its when you remember how little you thought about the people you broke up with, 

741
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,500
and you realize that that is how little they're thinking about you, y'know. 

742
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:12,300
Y'know, you'd like to think that you're both in all this pain, 
but really, they're just, Hey, I'm glad you're gone. 

743
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,200
I know. 

744
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,900
You should look at bright colours. 

745
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,600
What? 

746
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,600
That's what the shrink told me, y'know. I was paying her 900 francs an hour,
 to hear that I was a homicidal maniac, 

747
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,800
and that I could eliminate my obsession if I would concentrate on bright colours. 

748
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,900
Yeah, well did it work? 

749
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,900
Well, 

750
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,400
Didn't help your pinball, did it? 

751
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,400
No. Yeah, well, you know. I haven't... I haven't killed anyone lately. 

752
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,800
Not lately? Well, that's good, you're cured, then. 

753
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:56,700
I mean, there's these breeds of monkeys, right, and all they do 
is have sex, like, all the time, y'know. 

754
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:02,500
And, uh, they turn out to be, like, the least violent, 
the most peaceful, the most happy, y'know, so I mean, 

755
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,100
maybe fooling around is not so bad. 

756
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,700
Are you talking about monkeys? 

757
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,000
Yes. I'm talking about monkeys. 

758
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,600
Ah, I thought so, yeah. 

759
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,500
Why? 

760
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,700
You know, I never heard this one, but it reminds me of, like, this perfect, y'know,

761
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,700
male argument to justify them fooling around. 

762
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,700
No, no, no. Woman monkeys are fooling around, too. Everybody's fooling around. 

763
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,600
Yeah, that's cute. You know, I have this awful paranoid thought, that 

764
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,600
feminism was mostly invented by men, so they could, like, fool around a little more. 

765
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,800
You know, women, free your minds, free your bodies, 
sleep with me. We're all happy and free as long as 

766
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,000
I can fuck as much as I want. 

767
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Alright, alright, alright. But maybe, maybe 
there's some biological things at work here. 

768
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,200
I mean, if you had an island, right, and there were 

769
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,900
99 women on the island, and only one man, in a year, 
you'd have the possibility of 99 babies. 

770
01:00:53,300 --> 01:01:00,900
But if you have an island with 99 men, and only one woman, 
in a year, you'd have the possibility of only one baby. So... 

771
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,200
So. You know what? 

772
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,900
What? 

773
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,500
On this island, y'know, I think that there will only be, like, maybe 43 men left. 

774
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,500
Because they would kill each other, trying to fuck this poor woman, you know what I mean? 

775
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,700
And on the other island, there would be 99 women, 99 babies, 

776
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,700
and no more man, 

777
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,700
because they would have all gotten together, and eaten him alive. 

778
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,400
Oh yeah? 

779
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:21,800
Yeah. 

780
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:29,700
Yeah? Yeah? See... see, I think there's something to that. 
I think on some level, women don't mind the idea of destroying a man, y'know. Like

781
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,500
I was once walking down the street with my ex-girlfriend, y'know, 
right, and we just walked by these, like, real four, 

782
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,700
I was once walking down the street with my ex-girlfriend, y'know, 
right, and we just walked by these, like, real four,

783
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,000
kind of thuggy looking guys, next to a Camaro, y'know, and 

784
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,300
one of 'em, sure enough, says, 'Hey baby, nice ass.' Y'know, I mean. 

785
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,700
So, I'm like, alright, Hey, no big deal, I'm not gonna get uptight about this, right? 

786
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,500
Yeah, plus, there were four of them, right? 

787
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,500
Yeah, exactly, there's four of them, right, but she turns around and she says 
 Fuck you, dickheads, and I'm like, Okay, 

788
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:55,300
wait a minute, here, right.They're not gonna 
come over here and kick her ass, y'know what
I mean. So who just got pushed to the front line on that one? 

789
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,900
You see what I'm saying? I mean, women say they 
hate it if your all territorial and protective, 

790
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
but if it suits them, then they'll tell you you're being all unmanly, or wimpy, or, uh. 

791
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:14,100
You know what? I don't think women really want to destroy men, and if, 
even if they want to, they don't.. they don't succeed.

792
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,100
You know what I mean? I'm sure even, y'know, men are destroying women, 
or are able... capable of destroying women, much more than women... 

793
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,400
Well, anyway, its depressing, I mean y'know what? 

794
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,900
What? You want to stop talking about this? 

795
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:29,800
-Yeah. I really hate it. You know Men-Women you know, its, 
-its... there's no end to this, like, y'know... 

796
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:30,900
Its like a skipping record, y'know 

797
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,200
Yeah. 

798
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,200
Every couple's been having this conversation forever. 

799
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,200
Any nobody's come up with anything. 

800
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,500
I saw a documentary on that. It's a birth dance. 

801
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,100
A birth dance. 

802
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,900
Yeah. 

803
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,900
Should I give her some money? 

804
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,000
Yeah. 

805
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Everything that's interesting costs a little bit of money. I'm telling you. 

806
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,600
So, birth dance, huh? Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me. 

807
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,300
No, but really. Women used this when giving birth. 
In some parts of the world, they still do it. 

808
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,400
Yeah? 

809
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:50,400
Yeah. The woman in labour enters a tent, and the women 
of her tribe surround her, and dance, 

810
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,400
and they encourage the birthing woman to dance with them as... 
so as to make the birth less painful. 

811
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Yeah... 

812
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,100
When the baby is born, they all dance in celebration. 

813
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,100
Wow. I don't think my mom would've gone for that. 

814
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,900
I like the idea of dancing as a common function in life, 
something everybody participates in. 

815
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah, I know. I heard about this old guy, who was watching some young people dance.

816
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:16,500
And he said, how beautiful. They're trying to shake off their genitals, and become angels. 

817
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,600
I like that

818
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:24,000
Alright. One question, though, back there. 
When the women are dancing, and being all spiritual, and stuff, right? 

819
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,200
Where are the men? 

820
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,200
Are we out food-gathering? Are we not invited? Y'all don't need us? What? 

821
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,700
Men are lucky we don't bite off their head after mating. 
Certain insects do that, you know, like spiders, and stuff. 

822
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,100
We, at least, let you live. What are you complaining about? 

823
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:42,100
Yes. See, you're officially kidding, but there's something to that,
 you know. You keep bringing stuff like that up. 

824
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:43,900
What? 

825
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:44,600
Yeah. 

826
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,600
No, no, no, wait a minute. Talking seriously here. I mean, .. I, 

827
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:53,300
I always feel this pressure of being a strong and independent icon of womanhood,
 and without making... making it look my... 

828
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,500
my whole life is revolving around some guy. 

829
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,100
But Loving someone, and being loved means so much to me. 

830
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:10,000
We always make fun of it and stuff. 

831
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more? 

832
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,500
Hmmm. Yeah, 

833
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,300
I don't know . 

834
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:25,300
Sometimes I dream about being a good father and a good husband, 

835
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,300
and sometimes that feels really close. 

836
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,800
But then, other times, 

837
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,800
it seems silly. Like, it would, uh, ruin my whole life. 

838
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:46,000
And its not just a, uh, a fear of commitment, 
or that I'm incapable of caring, or loving, because 

839
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,700
I can. It's just that 

840
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,500
if I'm totally honest with myself, 

841
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:56,500
I think I'd rather die knowing that I was really good at something, 

842
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,200
that I had excelled in some way, 

843
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:04,200
y'know, then that I had just been in a nice, caring relationship. 

844
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:11,500
Yeah

845
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:19,500
but I had worked for this older man, and once he told me that he had spent all 
of his life thinking about his career and his work, and... 

846
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,500
he was 52 and it suddenly struck him that 
he had never really given anything of himself. 

847
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,500
His life was for no one, and nothing. 

848
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,500
He was almost crying saying that. 

849
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,900
Y'know, I believe if there's any kind of God, it wouldn't be in any of us. 

850
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,500
Not you, or me... 

851
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,500
but just this little space in between. 

852
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:52,100
If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be 
in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something .

853
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,600
I know, its almost impossible to succeed, but... 

854
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,600
who cares, really? 

855
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,600
The answer must be in the attempt. 

856
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,300
I really think this is a civilization in decline. Look at the service. 

857
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,300
I mean, where is the waitress? In New York, this person would be out of a job. 

858
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Okay, now I'm going to call my best friend in Paris, 
who I'm supposed to have lunch with in 8 hours. 

859
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,500
Okay? 

860
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,600
okay. 

861
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,600
Dring-Dring. Dring-Dring. Dring-Dring. Pick up! 

862
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,300
What? 

863
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,400
Pick up the phone. 

864
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,200
Oh, hello? 

865
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:50,900
Àllo? 

866
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,600
MmHmm. 

867
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,700
Vanie? Ici Lina. 

868
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,400
Ahh... 

869
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,700
Comment ça-va? 

870
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:59,200
Ah, bien, et toi? 

871
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,900
Vanie, ma vacation est incroyable! 

872
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,900
Ahhh... y' - a- I- y'know, I've been working on my English, 
recently, w- y'want to talk in English? 

873
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,700
Yeah, okay, that's a good idea. 

874
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:14,800
Ummm... I don't think I'm gonna be able 
to make it for lunch today, I'm sorry. I... 

875
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,600
I met a guy on the train, and I got off with him in Vienna. We're still there. 

876
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,400
Are you crazy? 

877
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,000
Probably. 

878
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,900
We.. wa.. he's Austrian, he's from there? 

879
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,300
N-n-n-n-no. 

880
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,700
He's passing through here too. He's American. 
He's going back home tomorrow morning. 

881
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,900
Why'd you get off the train with him? 

882
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:37,400
Well... he convinced me. 

883
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,400
Well, actually I was  I was ready to get off the train 
with him after talking to him a short while.

884
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,300
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it. 

885
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,300
We were in the lounge car, and he began to talk about him, 
as a little boy, seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

886
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,800
I think that's when I fell for him. 

887
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,800
Just the idea of this little boy with all those beautiful dreams.  

888
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,500
He trapped me. 

889
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,800
MmHmm  

890
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,800
And he's so cute! He has beautiful blue eyes, 

891
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,900
nice big lips, , 

892
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,900
greasy hair, I love it. 

893
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,900
He's kind of tall, and a little clumsy.  

894
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:26,900
I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away.  

895
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:34,200
He kind of kisses like an adolescent, its so cute. 

896
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,200
What? 

897
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,600
Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable. 

898
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,000
As the night went on, I began to like him more and more.

899
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But I'm afraid he's scared of me. Y'know, I told him the story about 
the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend, and stuff.

900
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
He must be scared to death.He must be thinking I'm this manipulative, mean woman. 

901
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,000
I just hope he doesn't feel that way about me, because you know me, 

902
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I'm the most harmless person. 

903
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:08,500
The only person I could really hurt is myself. 

904
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,600
I don't think he's scared of you. 

905
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,200
I think he's crazy about you. 

906
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:13,700
Really? 

907
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:17,700
I mean, I've known you a long time, 
and I got a good feeling. You gonna see him again? 

908
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
We haven't talked about that yet.  

909
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:30,300
Okay its your turn. You call your friend.Okay? 

910
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,400
Alright, alright. Umm...  

911
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,600
Uh,Bring-Bring-Bring.I usually get this guys answering machine. Brawwwwwwng. 

912
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,700
Hi dude, what's up? 

913
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:46,700
Uhhhh... Hey Frank, how you been? Glad you're home. 

914
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:51,300
Cool. Yeah. So, how was Madrid? 

915
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:57,300
Uh, Madrid... sucked! Y'know, Lisa and I had our long-overdue meltdown. 

916
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,400
Oh. Too bad. I told you, no? 

917
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing just never works.

918
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,900
I was only in Madrid for a couple of days. 

919
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,900
I got a cheaper flight, out of Vienna... but, uh, 

920
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,200
y'know, it really wasn't that much cheaper. I just, uh... 

921
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,800
I couldn't go home right away. 

922
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,800
I didn't want to see anybody I knew, 
I just wanted to be a ghost. Completely anonymous. 

923
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,300
So are you okay, now? 

924
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:27,000
Yeah. Yeah, no, no, yeah, I'm great, I'm great! That's the thing, I'm... 

925
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,500
I'm rapturous. And I'll tell you why. 

926
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,900
I met somebody. On my last night in Europe, can you believe that? 

927
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,100
Ah, That's incredible. 

928
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:39,100
I know, I know. And you know how they 
say we're all each others' demons and angels? 

929
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:44,900
Well, she was literally a Botaccelli angel. 

930
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Just telling me that everything was gonna be okay. 

931
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,600
How did you meet? 

932
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:58,700
On the train. Yeah, she was sitting next to this very weird 
couple who started fighting so she had to move.

933
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,500
She sat right across the aisle from me.

934
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,500
So, we started to talk, and, uh, she didn't like me much at first. 

935
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:10,100
She's super smart, very passionate, um... 

936
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,500
and beautiful. 

937
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,300
And I was so unsure of myself. 

938
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:20,300
I thought everything I said sounded so stupid. 

939
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,000
Oh, man, I wouldn't worry about that. 

940
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,600
No... 

941
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,200
No, I'm sure she was not judging you. 

942
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,200
No... And by the way, she sat next to you, no? I'm sure she did it on purpose. 

943
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,400
Oh, Yeah? 

944
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,400
Yeah.

945
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:41,100
Us men are so stupid. We don't understand anything about women. 

946
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,400
They act kind of strange. The little I know of them. Don't they? 

947
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:51,800
Yeah. 

948
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,300
I feel like this is, uh, some dream world we're in, y'know. 

949
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,700
Yeah, it's so weird.

950
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:03,700
Its like our time together is just ours. Its our own creation. 

951
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,400
It must be like I'm in your dream, and you in mine, or something. 

952
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:14,500
And what's so cool is that this whole evening, all our time together, 
shouldn't officially be happening. 

953
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:19,500
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why this feels so otherworldly. 

954
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:25,100
But then the morning comes, and we turn into pumpkins, right? 

955
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:33,900
Yeah, I know.  But at this time, I think you're supposed 
to produce the glass slipper, and see if it fits. 

956
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:34,300
Yeah? 

957
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,800
Yeah. 

958
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,800
It'll fit. 

959
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
This friend of mine had a kid, and it was a home birth, 
so he was there helping out and everything. 

960
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,700
And he said at that profound moment of birth, uh,

961
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,100
he was watching this child, experiencing life for the first time, 

962
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,400
I mean, trying to take its first breath... 

963
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:16,200
all he could think about was that he was 
looking at something that was gonna die someday.

964
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,300
He just couldn't get it out of his head.

965
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,700
And I think that's so true, I mean, all-- 

966
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,200
everything is so finite. 

967
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,500
I mean, but, but don't you think that that's what, um, 

968
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:31,000
makes our time, at specific moments, so important? 

969
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Yeah, I know. It's the same for us, tonight, though. 

970
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,800
After tomorrow morning, we're probably never 
going to see each other again, right? 

971
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,600
You don't think we'll ever see each other again? 

972
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,500
What do you think? 

973
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:53,500
Well, um, gosh, I don't know. uh, I mean, I hadn't planned another trip to... 

974
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:03,400
Oh, Me too, y'know. I live in Paris, 
you live in the US. I totally understand that... 

975
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,600
I mean, I'd hate to make you fly. You know, you hate to fly, right? 

976
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,600
I'm not so scared of flying. I mean I could... 

977
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,400
I mean, if you were gonna come to the US, or 

978
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,400
if, y'know, I mean, if I, or y'know, I mean, 
I could come back here, I mean... What? 

979
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:25,200
Now let's just be rational adults about this. 

980
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:32,000
We, maybe we should try something different. 
I mean, its no so bad if tonight is our only night, right?

981
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,100
People always exchange phone numbers, addresses, 
they end up writing once, calling each other once or twice... 

982
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,900
Right. Fizzles out. Yeah, I mean, I don't want that. I hate that. 

983
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,600
I hate that too, y'know. 

984
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,400
Why do you think everybody thinks relationships
 are supposed to last forever anyway? 

985
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,200
Yeah, why. It's stupid. 

986
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:59,700
So, you think tonight's it, huh? I mean, that, tonight's our only night. 

987
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,400
Its the only way, no? 

988
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:16,300
Well, alright. Let's do it. No delusions,
 no projections. We'll just make tonight great. 

989
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,800
Okay, let's do that. 

990
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,800
Okay. 

991
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,300
We should do some kind of handshake, you know. Give me your hand. 

992
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,700
Alright. To our one and only night together, 

993
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,600
and the hours that remain. 

994
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:07,100
What? 

995
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,800
Its just... its depressing, no? 

996
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,100
That the... the only thing we're gonna think of is 

997
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,100
when we're gonna have to say goodbye tomorrow. 

998
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:21,300
Well, we could say goodbye now. Then we wouldn't have to 
worry about it in the morning. 

999
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,900
Now? 

1000
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,000
Yeah. Say goodbye. 

1001
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Bye. 

1002
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,500
Goodbye. 

1003
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,600
you have a...  Au revoir. 

1004
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,800
later. 

1005
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,800
Later, yeah. 

1006
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Alright, so here's the plan, right. You're gonna grab the glasses, 
and I'm gonna get the wine

1007
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,900
-Red wine
-Red wine. right.

1008
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,500
-You think you can do that?
-Nooooo problem

1009
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,400
-wish me luck
-okay good luck

1010
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,300
-Hello.
-Hello. 

1011
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Uh... Do you speak English? 

1012
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,500
Euh, a bit.

1013
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,300
Yeah, a bit? Well, alright. I'm having kind of 
an odd situation here, which is that... 

1014
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:37,100
Uh, this is... you see that girl over there?

1015
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,200
Yeah... 

1016
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:46,600
Yeah, well, this is our only night together. 
Um, And she, ahh, ALright. Here's the problem

1017
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:52,700
The problem is that she wants a bottle of red wine, 
and I don't have any money.

1018
01:19:55,400 --> 01:20:00,100
I was thinking that you might want to, um, 
give me the address of this bar 

1019
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:07,000
No, I know...and I would promise to send you the money, 
and you would make our night complete

1020
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,400
You would send me the money? 

1021
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,400
Yes.

1022
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:18,200
Your hand?.

1023
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,800
Okay

1024
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,000
For the greatest night in your life

1025
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Thank you very much

1026
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,400
So often in my life I've been with people, and shared beautiful moments 

1027
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,400
like travelling, or staying up all night and watching the sunrise, 

1028
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,300
and I knew those were special moments. 

1029
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:15,300
But something was always wrong. 

1030
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:22,200
I wished I'd been with someone else. 
I knew that what I was feeling, exactly 

1031
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,200
what was so important to me, they didn't understand.

1032
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,600
But I'm happy to be with you.

1033
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:39,100
You couldn't possibly know why a night like 
this is so important to my life right now,

1034
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,200
 but it is.

1035
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,600
This is a great morning. 

1036
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,600
It is a great morning. 

1037
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:55,700
Do you think we'd have others like this. 

1038
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:04,900
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. 

1039
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:10,500
I know what you mean about wishing somebody wasn't there, though. 

1040
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,600
Its just usually its myself that I wish I could get away from. 

1041
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,500
Seriously, think about this.

1042
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,200
I have never been anywhere 

1043
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,500
that I haven't been. 

1044
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,100
I've never had a kiss

1045
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,300
when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1046
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,300
Y'know, I've never, um, 

1047
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,900
gone to the movies, when I wasn't there in the audience. 

1048
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:36,900
I've never been out bowling, if I wasn't there, 
y'know making some stupid joke.

1049
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,000
I think that's why so many people hate themselves.

1050
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,400
Seriously, its just they are sick to death of 

1051
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,000
being around themselves. 

1052
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,800
Lets say that you and I were together all the time, 

1053
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,700
then you'd start to hate a lot of my mannerisms. 

1054
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,600
The way, uh, the way every time 

1055
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,100
we would have people over,

1056
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:01,100
uh, I'd be insecure, and I'd get a little too drunk. 

1057
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
or, uh, the way I'd tell the same stupid pseudo-intellectual 

1058
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
story again, and again.

1059
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,800
Y'see, I've heard all those stories.

1060
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,200
So of course I'm sick of myself.

1061
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,200
But being with you,

1062
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:26,500
uh, its made me feel like I'm somebody else. 

1063
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,800
Y'know the only other way to lose yourself 
like that is, um, y'know, 

1064
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:35,500
dancing, or alcohol, or 

1065
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,700
drugs, and stuff like that. 

1066
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,400
Fucking? 

1067
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,500
Fuh... Fucking?

1068
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:51,500
Yeah, that's one way, yeah. 

1069
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,500
Do you know what I want? 

1070
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,500
What? 

1071
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
To be kissed. 

1072
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,800
Well, I can do that.

1073
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,500
Wait! 

1074
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,500
I have to say something stupid. 

1075
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:42,200
Alright. 

1076
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,200
Its very stupid. 

1077
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,800
Okay. 

1078
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,800
I don't think we should sleep together.

1079
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,800
I mean, I want to, but since 

1080
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,800
we're never gonna see each other again... 

1081
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,400
it'll make me feel bad.

1082
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:02,900
I won't know who else
 you're with. I'll miss you. 

1083
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,800
I know. It's not 

1084
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,200
very adult. Maybe its a female thing, I can't help it. 

1085
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,200
Let's see each other again. 

1086
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:21,400
No, I don't want you to break our vow, just os you can get laid. 

1087
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,800
I don't want to just get laid. I want to um, 

1088
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,200
I mean, I mean, I think we 

1089
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:31,200
should. I mean, we'll be done in the morning, right? 

1090
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,500
I think we should. 

1091
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:38,100
No, then its like some male fantasy. Meet a french girl on a train,

1092
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,600
fuck her, and never see her again. 

1093
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,300
That would be this great story to tell, 

1094
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:45,000
I don't want to be a great story. 
I dont want this great evening to just have been for that. 

1095
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,800
-Okay?
-Okay.

1096
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,800
Okay

1097
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,500
We don't have to have sex. It's not a big deal. 

1098
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Okay. 

1099
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:05,000
You don't want to see me again? 

1100
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
No, of course I do. Listen, if somebody 
gave me the choice right now, 

1101
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,300
of to never see you again or to marry you, 

1102
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,400
alright, I would marry you, 

1103
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,100
alright. And maybe that's a lot of romantic bullshit, but

1104
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:20,100
people have gotten married for a lot less. 

1105
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,600
Actually, 

1106
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,600
I think I had decided I wanted to sleep with you
 when we got off the train.

1107
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:36,600
But now that we've talked so much, I don't know anymore. 

1108
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,800
Why do I make everything so complicated? 

1109
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,800
I don't know. 

1110
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
What do you think's the first thing 
you're gonna do when you get back to Paris? 

1111
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:58,400
Call my parents. 

1112
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,000
Yeah? 

1113
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
What about you? 

1114
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I don't know... I'll probably go pick up my dog.
 He's staying with a friend of mine. 

1115
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:05,900
You have a dog? 

1116
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:06,600
Yeah. 

1117
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,100
I love dogs. 

1118
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:07,600
You do? 

1119
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,300
Yeah. 

1120
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:09,700
Oh shit. 

1121
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,500
What? 

1122
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,000
Oh, I don't know. We're back in real time. 

1123
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,700
I know. I hate that. 

1124
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:20,200
What is that?  

1125
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,700
Sounds like a harpsicord. 

1126
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:26,700
Check that out 

1127
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,400
Cool. 

1128
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:55,300
We'll dance to the harpsicord. 

1129
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:59,300
Of course. 

1130
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,200
Oh, wow. 

1131
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,500
What? 

1132
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,500
Uh.... I'm gonna take your picture. 

1133
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,400
So I never forget you or, uh,

1134
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,000
or all this. 

1135
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Okay. Me too. 

1136
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:19,400
And the years shall run like rabbits 

1137
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:24,400
What? 

1138
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,600
Nothing. Nothing. 

1139
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,600
I have this, uh, recording of Dylan Thomas,

1140
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,200
reading a W.H.Auden poem. He's got a great voice. 

1141
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:40,900
You just... It's like, uh... 

1142
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
What, what? 

1143
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
All the clocks in the city 

1144
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,900
Began to whir, and chime.

1145
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,700
Oh, let not time deceive you,

1146
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,300
You can not conquer time.

1147
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,200
In headaches and in worry,

1148
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,300
Vaguely life leaks away.

1149
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:00,700
And time will have its fancy,

1150
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:03,600
Tomorrow, or today.

1151
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,600
Hm. Something like that. 

1152
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,600
Its good.

1153
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:19,100
When you talked earlier about after a few years, 

1154
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:22,300
how a couple begin to hate each other, by 

1155
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,400
anticipating their reactions, or 

1156
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,300
getting tired of their mannerisms.

1157
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:30,600
I think it would be the opposite for me. 

1158
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,600
I think I could really fall in love when I know everything about someone. 

1159
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:40,100
The way he's gonna part his hair. Which shirt he's gonna wear that day.

1160
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:44,400
Knowing the exact story he'd tell in a given situation. 

1161
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:50,200
I'm sure that's when I'd know I'm really in love. 

1162
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:11,800
Hey guess what? 

1163
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,200
What? 

1164
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,400
We didn't go to those guys' play. 

1165
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,300
Play? 

1166
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,000
Yeah. 

1167
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:17,700
The cow? 

1168
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:18,400
Yeah. 

1169
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:22,400
Yeah, we didn't. Oh no, we missed it.

1170
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,100
Okay, you know what bus you're taking to the airport? 

1171
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,600
Yeah, yeah. No problem. 

1172
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,700
I should get on this one 

1173
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:53,700
Right here? You want to get on there? 

1174
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:57,700
Yeah. 

1175
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Okay. I guess this is it, no? 

1176
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,300
Yeah. Um, I really, 

1177
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:09,300
I, uh, I... I mean, you know what I mean. 

1178
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:14,100
Yeah, I know what -- I, uh. 

1179
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,500
Yeha, My... Have a great life. 

1180
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,000
Have fun with 
everything you're gonna do. Work hard... 

1181
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:21,900
Yeah. 

1182
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,100
Good luck in school, and all that. 

1183
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,800
Okay. 

1184
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,000
I hate this. 

1185
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,400
Me too. My train is about to leave. 

1186
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:33,400
Yeah. 

1187
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,800
Listen. Listen. You know all this bullshit we're talking about, about not 

1188
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:42,800
seeing each other again? I don't want to do that. 

1189
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,800
I don't want to do that either. 

1190
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,200
You don't either? 

1191
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,100
I was waiting for you to say something. 

1192
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:48,900
Well, why didn't you say something? 

1193
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,000
I was afraid maybe you didn't want to see me. 

1194
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,400
Alright, alright, well look. Listen, listen.
 What-d... what-d... What do you want to do? 

1195
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:56,700
Maybe... maybe we should meet here, in five years or something. 

1196
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:59,500
Alright, alright. Five years. Five years? That's a long time. 

1197
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:03,000
Yes. Its awful. Its like a sociological experiment. How about one year? 

1198
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,300
One year. Alright, alright. 

1199
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:06,000
One year. 

1200
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,900
How about six months? 

1201
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:07,800
Six months? 

1202
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,900
Yeah. 

1203
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:09,800
Its gonna be freezing. 

1204
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,200
Yeah? 

1205
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,200
Yeah. 

1206
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,400
Who cares? We come here, we go somewhere else. 

1207
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,300
Okay. Okay. 

1208
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:19,600
Uh, six months from now, or last night? 

1209
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,600
Um... Last night. Six months from last night, which was, uh, uh, June 

1210
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:29,100
16th. So uh, Track Nine, six months from now, at six o'clock at night. 

1211
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000

01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,800
December, yeah, right. Now listen, its a train ride for you,

1213
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,500

1214
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,100
alright, but I'm going to be here. 

1215
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,100
Okay, me too. 

1216
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,100
Alright. 

1217

And we're not gonna call or write or...

Na. 

1220

01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:44,900
-Yeah, okay.
-Alright. 

1222

 Alright, your train's gonna leave. Say goodbye. 

1223

Goodbye.
