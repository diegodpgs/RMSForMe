1
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,087
Oh, man.

2
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,885
That's it.

3
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,931
Nice grab.

4
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,519
Oh, yeah.

5
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,108
-All right, Danny, your turn.
-What? I didn't get my full turn.

6
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,777
You did. I counted.
That was 25. That's what we said.

7
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,654
-That's not fair.
-It's exactly fair.

8
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,116
Come on, Danny. Time for your turn,
then I gotta work for an hour.

9
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,910
You're not the only one
who gets a turn.

10
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,787
"The only one who gets a turn."

11
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,372
Guys.

12
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,332
All right.

13
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:33,087
Keep your eye on the ball.
You got it this time. Ready?

14
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,218
All right, that's a good try.
It was a bad throw. It's a bad throw.

15
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,138
Sorry. My bad.

16
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,267
Okay. Here we go.
You can do this.

17
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,644
Here we go. Ready?

18
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,063
Okay.

19
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,983
A deep fly ball to right field.

20
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,069
Clemente back,
running on his horse real fast.

21
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,113
Can he get it? Can he get it?

22
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,408
Oh, and Milton Bradley with
his dive-and-roll catch.

23
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,745
-Dodgers win.
-You're such a dick.

24
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,168
What? It was a great grab.

25
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:20,426
Danny?

26
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,608
Danny, you should not be using that
kind of language with your brother.

27
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,735
But it's true.

28
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,113
Listen, kiddo,
when I was 6 years old--

29
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,116
-Six and three quarters.
-When I was 6 and three quarters...

30
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,452
...catching was hard for me too.

31
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,621
Well, it's not hard for Walter.

32
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,372
Well, Walter's 10.

33
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,708
So? He's still better than me
at everything.

34
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,003
No way.
He's not better than you at piano.

35
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,214
I hate that stupid thing.

36
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,843
Someday you're gonna be
really happy I got you that piano.

37
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,306
-You'll be at a party, there'll be a girl--
-Like you and Mom?

38
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,980
Look, Danny...

39
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,982
...you and Walter
are different people.

40
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,237
He's good at some things, you're good
at other things. That's how people are.

41
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,739
He beats me at everything.

42
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,575
Listen to me, this is important.

43
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,286
You're a very special kid.

44
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,749
That's what people say
when they can't think of anything.

45
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,835
You know how you always
make up games...

46
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,504
...and pretend to be characters?

47
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,549
You have an incredible imagination.

48
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,096
Amazing imagination.
A whole universe of an imagination.

49
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:51,767
And I use my imagination for a living,
so I know what I'm talking about.

50
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,272
-Is it better than Walter's?
-What?

51
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,817
Is my imagination better
than Walter's?

52
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,782
You're different than Walter.

53
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,958
-Don't do that.
-You wanna play catch?

54
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,127
-We just played catch.
-No, football catch.

55
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,712
I have to work for an hour.

56
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,173
-But it's Saturday.
-Tell me about it.

57
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,304
-All you ever do is work.
-Nice try.

58
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,431
-This is so unfair.
-Hello.

59
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,474
Bill, I am so sorry.

60
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,477
I'll call you back in two minutes.
Is that okay?

61
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,896
Thanks.

62
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,982
I have an important meeting
this afternoon.

63
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,277
-I've-- I really have to be ready for it.
-You're going out?

64
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,988
Yes, I'm going out.
Well, I'm going to a meeting.

65
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,074
You're gonna be at Mom's house.
She's coming to get you at 3.

66
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,576
We go to Mom's tomorrow.

67
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,953
-No, today.
-This is a four-day Dad week.

68
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,914
Three-day Dad week.
Four-day lastweek...

69
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,749
...four-day next week,
three-day this week.

70
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,542
Four-day Mom week this week.

71
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,461
But that's not fair.

72
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,338
-To whom?
-To anyone.

73
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,672
I have to work.

74
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,675
We'd have all the time
if Danny wasn't around.

75
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,719
Well, Danny is around.

76
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,014
All right, five throws.

77
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,225
How do I put this? Let me think.
I have to work.

78
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,062
Dad, I'm ready to play
"Smash Bros."

79
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,022
You told him you'd play
"Smash Bros."?

80
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,524
I didn't tell him I was gonna
play "Smash Bros."

81
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,945
-You're playing catch with Walter?
-He might if you weren't around.

82
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,405
You're so mean.
Everybody wants to ruin my life.

83
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,366
You never keep your promises.

84
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,117
There's only one of me, okay?

85
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,829
I don't like this situation either,
it sucks, is what it does...

86
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,040
...but it's the best I could
come up with.

87
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,211
So climb off my back and give me
about two inches of space, will you?

88
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:04,692
There are some days, boys,
when you gotta grow up all at once.

89
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,736
I need today to be
one of those days.

90
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,330
Wanna play Chutes and Ladders?

91
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,749
No, you'll cheat.

92
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,584
Stratego?

93
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,254
No, you cheat at board games.

94
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,923
But you can't even cheat at Stratego.

95
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,717
Trust me, you'll find a way.

96
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,261
Hey. Sorry about that.

97
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,679
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

98
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,348
I'm not meeting him till 3:30,
I can finish by then.

99
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,183
Walter, look what I found.

100
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,269
Those belong to me. Put them back.

101
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,396
But you never play with them.

102
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,356
So? They're still mine.

103
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,608
When did you get so mean?

104
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,193
I'm not mean, Danny.

105
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,529
I'm in fourth grade,
I have a girlfriend.

106
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,614
You know how Dad said
we have to grow up?

107
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,450
Well, this is what it looks like.

108
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,286
Can we please play "Army Men"?

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,250
Copy that.

110
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,879
Sergeant, there is a helicopter on fire.
Let's get it.

111
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,964
The drawings all match
the foam mock-up.

112
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,632
-Get back here.
-Let me hold it.

113
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,634
-Yes, red.
-Give me.

114
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,220
Cranberry, right.
It's whatever color they picked.

115
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,638
I worked from the chits.

116
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:21,310
Can I call you back one more time?
It's a small domestic emergency here.

117
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,062
I-- I-- I know. I know.

118
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,814
-Dad.
-It's not a problem. Okay, thanks.

119
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,983
-Look what he did.
-I was on the phone.

120
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,486
-It was an accident.
-You're such a baby.

121
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,571
-I'm not a baby.
-You break all my stuff.

122
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,573
-You can't catch a ball...
-Enough.

123
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,909
-...and nobody wants you around.
-You shut up!

124
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,831
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

125
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

126
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,879
It's 10 minutes to the office.

127
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,173
I have to run off another copy.
I'll be back.

128
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,842
You're gonna leave us alone
in this creepy old house?

129
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,345
-It's not creepy, it's old.
-I like Mom's better.

130
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,430
Well, so did she, and now it's hers.

131
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,022
Look, this is a very special house.

132
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,276
The reason I'm working to fix it up
is I wanna make a home for us here.

133
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,613
I know it's not Mom's house,
and I know it's a little creaky...

134
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,449
...but give it some time,
it's gonna grow on you.

135
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,201
I don't wanna stay here alone.

136
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,621
Well, you're not gonna be alone.
I'm going to wake up Lisa.

137
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,873
-Don't wake up Lisa.
-What are you crazy?

138
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,959
She's sleeping. Let her sleep.

139
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,545
Honey.

140
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,047
Lisa. Honey.

141
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,799
Get up.

142
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:38,053
I need to go out. I need you to
look after your two favorite people.

143
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,597
Come on.

144
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,227
I can't. I have a date tonight.

145
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,937
What time?

146
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,148
We're hooking up at, like, 8.

147
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,734
-It's 2.
-So?

148
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,529
-So that's six hours from now.
-What's your point?

149
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,072
I need you to look after the boys.

150
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,075
By the way, it makes me uncomfortable
when you say "hooking up."

151
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,245
Why? It's not like it means anything.

152
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,914
-Hope it doesn't.
-It doesn't. It's just an expression.

153
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,834
-Hope it is.
-It is. God.

154
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,086
We never should have
rented Thirteen.

155
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,840
Keep your eye on them. Make sure
they don't burn down the house.

156
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,551
-Okay?
-I'm not deaf.

157
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,887
-I'm not deaf.
-What?

158
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,305
Dad, okay.

159
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,016
Fifteen minutes, just close the door.

160
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,768
Thank you.

161
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,284
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am.

162
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,119
Yeah, hold on.

163
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,978
Hey!

164
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,980
Dad said no video games.

165
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,316
He did not.

166
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,443
Fine.

167
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,658
It's a giraffe.

168
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,500
-This is Sports Center.
-Hey.

169
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,460
I was watching that.

170
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,172
It is Oakland. It is Boston.
It is Manny Ramirez.

171
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,967
-Can't we watch Sponge Bob?
-No.

172
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,970
-You used to like it.
-Times change.

173
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,138
Tartar sauce.

174
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,515
I'm hungry.

175
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,392
What do you want me
to do about it?

176
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,310
Make me macaroni and cheese?

177
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,687
I don't know how.

178
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,855
I'm hungry.
What do you know how to make?

179
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,524
Water.

180
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,694
Two-run shot. Are you kidding me?

181
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,737
Next batter, Jason Varitek.

182
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,783
In the air to deep right field.
Down the line, towards the pole.

183
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,454
-How about if you and me play catch?
-No.

184
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,544
The first guy to give up
walk-off home runs...

185
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,714
...on consecutive days since 1998.

186
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,966
Bo Sox win it 6 to 5.

187
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,727
History-making momentfor....

188
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,229
You're dead!

189
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,606
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

190
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,667
Danny?

191
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,963
Where are you?

192
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,094
Danny?

193
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,182
Where are you, Danny?

194
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,979
Danny?

195
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,815
Where are you?

196
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,070
-There you are.
-I said I was sorry.

197
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,114
Don't. No.

198
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,786
-Don't do that, it's not funny.
-You'll be safe here till Dad gets back.

199
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,873
You're just jealous because
Dad thinks I'm smarter than you.

200
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,459
I didn't mean that.

201
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,882
Walter. No. Pull me up. Don't.

202
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,300
What's the matter, Danny?

203
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,136
Not still scared of the basement,
are you?

204
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,223
Walter! No, Walter!

205
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,058
It's not funny! No!

206
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,813
Pull me up! Walter!

207
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,816
Three-year-olds
are scared of basements.

208
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,248
You're really mean.

209
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,084
Dad said not to play in there.

210
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,506
Look what I found in the basement.

211
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,800
Looks dumb and old.

212
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,927
I like it.

213
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,971
Yeah, you would, it's for babies.

214
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,480
Walter, this is so cool.
Check this out.

215
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,783
What's Zathura?

216
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,007
-Will you play with me?
-No.

217
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,843
-I won't cheat.
-Yeah, you will.

218
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,547
-A card came out.
-Fascinating.

219
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,219
"Me-- Mete--

220
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,723
Meor sho--

221
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,393
Meeor sh-- sho--"

222
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,395
Read this for me.

223
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,150
"Meteor shower.
Take evasive action."

224
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,860
What's evasive action?

225
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,612
It's when you get out of the way.

226
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,157
What exactly am I supposed to
get out of the way of, exactly?

227
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,410
I have no idea.
All it says is "Take evasive a--"

228
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,937
Grandma.

229
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,779
It's meteors!

230
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:03,243
Take erasive action!

231
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,227
Danny, in here.

232
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,729
Danny, hurry up. It's safe.

233
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,272
Danny, come on. Hurry.

234
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,898
Danny, come on, hurry up.

235
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,444
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Come on. Get in, get in.

236
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,669
This is Sports Center.

237
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,465
Schilling deals no love--

238
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,741
I don't think we should play
that game anymore.

239
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,885
That's weird.

240
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,013
It only hit the living room.

241
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,616
Wow, outer space.

242
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,368
No, that's just nighttime.

243
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,165
I don't know, Walter.
Night never looked so close before.

244
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,715
Wait.

245
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,390
Walter, check this out.

246
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,480
-Tell her.
-You tell her.

247
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,523
You should,
she won't freak out as much.

248
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,484
We shouldn't really even be in here.

249
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,819
Dude, we're in outer space.
It doesn't matter.

250
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,529
Then you wake her.

251
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,365
Fine.

252
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,992
Lisa.

253
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,536
Lisa. Lisa--

254
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,164
-Go away.
-Lisa, you gotta get up.

255
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,166
What's the rule about
being in my room?

256
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,335
We're not allowed
unless it's an emergency.

257
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,379
And what's the emergency?

258
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,215
There was a meteor shower
and everything got wrecked.

259
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,384
-We can't get back to Earth.
-Shut up!

260
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,552
-Just look.
-Yeah.

261
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,391
-Oh, no.
-What do we do?

262
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,434
It's already dark?
I'm gonna be so late.

263
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,395
-It's not dark.
-We're in outer space.

264
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,897
I saw Saturn outside.

265
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,234
Lisa, open up.

266
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,528
Shut up and listen to me.

267
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,613
Dad put me in charge
until he got home.

268
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,782
Which means you guys
need to do what I say.

269
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,493
Do me a favor. Go downstairs
and stay out of my face.

270
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,911
But it's an emergency.

271
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,746
-Is the house on fire?
-No.

272
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,415
-Is anyone hurt?
-No, but--

273
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,333
-Then leave.
-Lisa, please.

274
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,420
We're really scared. Can you just
watch what this game does?

275
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,676
If this is some weird joke you guys
are trying to pull, you're dead.

276
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,136
No, it's not a joke.

277
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,596
Here, watch this. Watch this. Here.

278
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,183
-Okay. So wind the key.
-All right.

279
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,519
-So now I'm winding the key.
-Yeah, see?

280
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,688
-And then push the button.
-So I push it?

281
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,106
-Yeah.
-Pushing the button.

282
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,192
Then the number winds,
and whatever the number is, like nine.

283
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,944
Then your ship-- The blue ship...

284
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,447
...because the red ship is mine,
I got a five.

285
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,200
So then it goes to nine,
which would be that thing.

286
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,369
-All right.
-Then the card's gonna pop out.

287
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,579
-The card.
-The card.

288
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,456
-The card!
-The card!

289
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,624
-The card.
-Here's the scary part.

290
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,294
"You're promoted to
a starship captain.

291
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,920
Move ahead two spaces."

292
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,549
Fascinating.

293
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,843
-Lisa, no, no! Lisa!
-No, wait, Lisa!

294
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,096
Wait, that one didn't count.
Let me go. Let me go. Here. Okay.

295
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,392
It's stuck.

296
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,479
Maybe we have to take turns.

297
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,647
See? It was my turn.

298
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,025
-Four.
-Yeah, four.

299
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:14,822
Card.

300
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:20,328
"Shipmate enters cryonic
sleep chamber for five turns."

301
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,497
What the heck does that mean?

302
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,137
Lisa?

303
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,015
Does "cryonic" mean ice?

304
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,017
Lisa.

305
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,438
Help.

306
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,051
I killed her.

307
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,594
You didn't kill her.

308
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,139
She's frozen in cryonic sleep.

309
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,226
I gotta melt her.

310
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,411
Are you crazy?

311
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,413
We can't just leave her here
like this.

312
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,332
Maybe we should read
the instructions.

313
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,882
"Zathura.
Attention, space adventurers.

314
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,675
Zathura awaits.

315
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,178
Do you have what it takes
to navigate the galaxy?

316
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,263
It's not for the faint of heart.

317
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,182
For once you embark
upon your journey...

318
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,601
...there's no turning back
until Zathura's reached.

319
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,728
Pieces reset
at the end of each game.

320
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,439
Play again and again
for different adventures."

321
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,192
That's it. We gotta keep playing.

322
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,235
I'm not playing that thing.

323
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,863
Yes, we are.
It says we go home if we win.

324
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,865
It-- It didn't say that.

325
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,618
Yes, it did. "Pieces reset
at the end of each game."

326
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,786
That means we go home
when we're finished.

327
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,707
All I know is that when we play
this game, bad things happen.

328
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,210
All I know is that when I played,
I got promoted.

329
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,170
So I'm gonna win this
and get us home.

330
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,088
-Wait, can we--?
-Don't be a baby.

331
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,548
I'm not a baby.

332
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,807
Look, eight, I'm halfway there.

333
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,407
"Your robot is defective."

334
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,159
What does that mean?

335
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,744
Means my robot's broken.

336
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,330
But you don't even have a robot.

337
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:40,319
Emergency.

338
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,161
That's your robot?

339
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,706
-At least I got one.
-Well, what does it do?

340
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,334
Anything I want.
Get me a juice box, beyotch.

341
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,545
-Don't do that.
-Why not? It's my robot.

342
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,797
-You might make it mad.
-It's 3 inches tall.

343
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,383
I'll punt it across the room.
My robot, the card says.

344
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,553
I never said it wasn't your robot.
You don't have to be a jerk.

345
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,347
Dude, you're just jealous
I have a robot and you don't.

346
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,558
-Why would I want--?
-Emergency.

347
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,353
Emergency.

348
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,450
Alien life form.

349
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,493
Must destroy.

350
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,413
Walter, I think he's talking
about you.

351
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,555
Alien life form.

352
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,641
Must destroy.

353
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,311
Danny, take your turn.

354
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,198
-There's no key.
-Find it.

355
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,517
Take it, take it. Come on, hurry.

356
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,877
Take your turn!

357
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,230
Why didn't you go?
I could have been killed.

358
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,525
I was scared. But it's okay,
he's gone, isn't he?

359
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,782
Danny, take your turn.

360
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,547
-Danny, give me the card.
-It's still moving.

361
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,760
Hurry up, Danny.

362
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,972
The card.

363
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,077
What did the card say?

364
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,359
"You pass too close to Tsouris-3.
Enter gravity field."

365
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:54,526
Danny!

366
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,154
Walter!

367
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,789
What?

368
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,046
-What happened?
-It's Lisa.

369
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,931
Is she okay?

370
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,484
Walter, do you think she's okay?

371
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,988
I guess. She's still in one piece.

372
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,782
What happened to the robot?

373
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,677
What are you doing?

374
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,971
I think it's dead.

375
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,855
Get up here.

376
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,243
Do you think the door
will hold the robot?

377
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,869
No.

378
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,413
Great.

379
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,876
Yeah, once he fixes himself,
we're screwed.

380
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,628
He's fixing himself?

381
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,421
How should I know?

382
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,684
Looks about right.

383
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,602
You think she's okay?

384
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,605
I don't wanna be here
when she wakes up.

385
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,983
Where are you going?

386
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,444
Taking my turn.

387
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,282
Are you crazy?
That thing's messed up.

388
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,622
"You're promoted to fleet admiral.
Move ahead four spaces."

389
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:47,175
-Okay, your turn.
-I'm not playing.

390
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,602
-What are you doing?
-Making mac and cheese.

391
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,480
There's no water, dummy,
we're in outer space.

392
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,613
Why are you doing that?

393
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,866
Because I'm hungry and I know
you're not gonna take care of me.

394
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,160
Don't bother, the gas won't work.

395
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,623
Any more advice?

396
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,208
You've gotta turn it up more.

397
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,256
Can we at least talk about this?

398
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,592
There's nothing to talk about,
I'm not going.

399
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:36,016
Danny, I just wanna go home,
and I can't unless you play.

400
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,852
Don't you wanna get home?

401
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,687
What's so great
about home, anyway?

402
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,690
What do you mean? Everything
was great until you came along.

403
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,026
See? You treat me
like everything's my fault.

404
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,862
You're the one who pushed the button
in the first place.

405
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,324
I just wanted to play
a game with you, Walter.

406
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,493
Fine, what do you want?

407
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,872
I want you not to be mean to me,
not ignore me...

408
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,333
...and I want you to treat me
like your brother.

409
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,378
-Fine.
-Do we have an understanding?

410
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,213
Yeah.

411
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,007
Wasn't that easy?

412
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,397
Six.

413
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,410
"You are visited by Zorgons."

414
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,079
What's a Zorgon?

415
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:42,582
I don't think it's bad. Just visitors.

416
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,941
Zorgons!

417
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,398
Maybe they're friendly.

418
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,945
They're not friendly!

419
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:00,160
The fireplace. Hide in the fireplace.

420
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,849
Run!

421
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,157
Told you I didn't wanna go.
You're the one who made me spin.

422
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,992
There's nothing else we could do.

423
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,672
-Are you crazy?
-Got any better ideas?

424
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,353
"Reprogram"?
What the heck does that mean?

425
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,980
How am I supposed to know?

426
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,569
Reprogram!

427
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,754
It didn't work.

428
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,381
We'll figure it out later.

429
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,557
Go.

430
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,517
-No.
-Go.

431
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,227
-No!
-Go!

432
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:14,794
"Rest on standing AstroTurf."

433
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,798
-What?
-Rest on standing AstroTurf.

434
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,176
-Let me read it.
-No, I know how to read.

435
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:25,805
-I know how to read.
-Let me read it. God.

436
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,891
"Rescue stranded astronaut."

437
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,935
What stranded astronaut?

438
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,438
I guess there's gonna be some
stranded astronaut or some--

439
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,887
Did you lock the door?

440
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,014
I don't know.

441
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,189
Which one of you spun me?

442
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:03,570
-Who was it?
-Him.

443
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,531
Don't be so quick
to sell out your brother, kid.

444
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,408
He's all you got.

445
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,874
Looks like you got a pretty serious
Zorgon problem.

446
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,334
Yeah, what do we do?

447
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,587
-Hide.
-Hide?

448
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:23,173
They'll just explode
the whole house.

449
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,884
We're gonna hide the house.

450
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,937
Turn off all the lights
and electrical appliances.

451
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,273
-Me?
-Yes, you. Go. Do it.

452
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,777
Okay.

453
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,281
You. Come on,
kill that flame on the stove.

454
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,532
Okay.

455
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,545
Burning gas. That's probably what
brought them in the first place.

456
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,262
Okay. Now get the pilot light
on the furnace.

457
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,806
What's a pilot light?

458
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:17,936
In the basement.
Little blue flame under the big heater.

459
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:20,647
Blow it out like a candle. Like this:

460
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:18,371
Walter, the astronaut guy
is wrecking Dad's couch.

461
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:26,629
Come on.

462
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,220
That's Dad's nap couch.

463
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,820
You wanna help me
get this out of here?

464
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:13,635
Hit it.

465
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,429
-What's happening?
-Come on.

466
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,765
Take it.

467
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:22,352
Follow it.

468
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,398
There you go.

469
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,734
That's it.

470
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,203
Zorgons.

471
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,497
They're big, gnarly lizards.

472
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,749
Cold-blooded heat seekers.

473
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:49,170
And the tiniest spark of warmth
will bring them in like moths.

474
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,838
Flying all around the galaxy...

475
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,299
...Iooking for anything to burn up.

476
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,635
Why don't they just burn up
their own planet?

477
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,428
Oh, they already did.

478
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,138
That's not even the worst of it.

479
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,850
The real problem
is their ravenous appetite.

480
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,561
They never stop eating.

481
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,145
What do they eat?

482
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,607
-Meat.
-That's good.

483
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,987
Dude, you're meat.

484
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,685
Are you doing this
to keep Zorgons away?

485
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,771
Nope.

486
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:53,109
I'm doing this because I've been
eating paste out of a tube for 15 years.

487
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:15,173
-This totally sucks.
-Why?

488
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,008
He's eating all our food.

489
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:20,094
So? Lupe just went shopping.

490
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,430
How long do you think
we're gonna be out here?

491
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,265
It could be weeks. Then what?

492
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,017
I don't know.

493
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:29,562
What about air? How long is it gonna
last before he breathes it all up?

494
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,108
-I guess.
-I'm gonna say something.

495
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,028
No, wait. Walter. Walter.

496
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,366
Dude, that's our food.

497
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:45,828
Yep. And you're running low
on supplies.

498
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,247
Yeah, I know. You're eating it all.

499
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,961
Well, as I recall, the card said,
"Rescue stranded astronaut."

500
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,090
Looks to me like I'm the only one
that's doing any rescuing...

501
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:01,010
...so I don't think a couple Dagwood
sandwiches is too much to ask for.

502
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,471
Dog, you're eating it all.

503
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,309
I passed through a time sphincter
to get here.

504
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,269
You realize how difficult that is?

505
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,021
What's a time sphincter?

506
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,274
A wormhole, about yay big:

507
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,068
You squeeze through there...

508
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:20,196
...and tell me you're not
hungry enough to eat a carpet shark.

509
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,533
Sounds like you got a long trip
ahead of you.

510
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,285
Oh, you telling me to leave?

511
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:30,289
Well, I mean, once you get
finished eating, yeah.

512
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,626
I hate to break it to you,
but that's not your call.

513
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:37,130
He spun me, so it's up to him.

514
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,803
I'm fleet admiral,
and I'm telling you to hit the road.

515
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,437
I apologize, sir. I didn't-- I didn't
realize you were a fleet admiral.

516
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,815
In fact, I....

517
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,151
I'm a fleet admiral too.

518
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,779
It's just a card, bug nuts.

519
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,991
Well, he wants you to leave too.

520
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,993
That true, Danny?
You want me to split?

521
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,995
-Of course he does.
-Hey, mouthpiece...

522
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:12,498
...let him answer, all right?
I need to hear it from the big guy.

523
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,084
Well....

524
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,253
Danny, tell him
you want him to leave.

525
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,506
Well, he did help out a little.

526
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,634
Help? He burned our couch
and now he's eating all our food.

527
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,094
You call that helping?

528
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,097
You know what?

529
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,768
I'm just gonna go.
I feel like a third wheel anyways.

530
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,271
I mean, you guys are such a tight,
unified team here.

531
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:40,651
You're doing great too. I gotta tell you,
the house looks fantastic.

532
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,570
So I'll just get out of your hair...

533
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:46,532
...and let you guys whomp
some more Zorgon butt without me.

534
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,534
Wait.

535
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,495
Whose brother are you,
his or mine?

536
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,633
You can stay.

537
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,597
Orders are orders.

538
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:12,642
Come on, admiral, your turn.

539
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,482
-I'm sorry.
-Shut up.

540
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,900
I think he can help.

541
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,953
Okay. Why haven't
you guys started yet?

542
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,371
We're waiting for you.

543
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,541
Okay, well, I'm here,
so turn that clockwise--

544
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,544
-Yeah, I know how to play the game.
-Okay.

545
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,215
Hang on a second.
Something's wrong.

546
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,424
What?

547
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,261
I was ahead of you.

548
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,431
Somebody must have
kicked the board?

549
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,975
No, nobody kicked the board.

550
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,726
-You cheated.
-No, I didn't.

551
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,395
You cheated.
I knew you'd cheat.

552
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,939
-"Cheater's" a strong word.
-I didn't cheat.

553
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,275
-I didn't cheat!
-Guys, guys. Please.

554
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,070
Bring it down. Indoor voices.
Now, did you move the piece?

555
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:12,910
Maybe I moved the piece
by an accident.

556
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,871
Okay. It was an accident.

557
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,622
How can you move a piece
by accident?

558
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,125
It's stuck to the game.
It's impossible. You cheated.

559
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:22,295
No, no, no, let's not use that word.
No, stop saying "cheated."

560
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,131
-You cheated! Cheater!
-I didn't cheat!

561
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:29,302
Come on. Okay?
Now, where did you move from?

562
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,470
I was right here.

563
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,640
No, you weren't.
You were back there.

564
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,601
Okay.

565
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,728
Okay. Here, careful.

566
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,899
-God.
-Okay, it's fixed.

567
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,901
-You're such a baby.
-I'm not a baby.

568
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,235
Slowdown. Slow down.

569
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,904
-I'm not a baby.
-You're a baby.

570
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,322
Nobody is a baby here.

571
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,490
-I am not a baby!
-You're a little baby!

572
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,326
I'm not a baby!

573
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,330
Jeez, it won't stop! Please.

574
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,665
Okay, let's play the game.

575
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,459
Fine.

576
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,009
Won't stop spinning.

577
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,180
-What's wrong with it?
-You broke it.

578
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,767
Oh, look, there's the card.
See? It fixed itself.

579
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,855
"Caught cheating.
Automatic ejection"?

580
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,484
-Does it mean me?
-Well, you did move the piece.

581
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:27,860
He's the one who cheated.

582
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,201
Walter!

583
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,542
Hang on, Walter!

584
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,003
I'll save you.

585
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:47,964
Help!

586
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:51,884
Wait a minute! I got an idea!

587
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,352
I'm gonna swing
this lamp up to you...

588
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,854
...and you grab it,
and I'll pull you down.

589
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,356
I can't hang on any longer!

590
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,864
Don't worry, I'll get another lamp.

591
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,493
Stand back.

592
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,806
Walter?

593
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,024
Walter.

594
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:58,284
Oh, no.

595
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,093
You okay?

596
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,764
Are you okay?

597
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,185
Get away from me.

598
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:28,981
Sorry.

599
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,525
Don't talk to me till we get home.

600
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:35,946
That look cool from down here?

601
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,407
Because up there it was--
It was pretty intense.

602
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:42,161
My heart's pumping pretty good.
That was fun.

603
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:45,623
Can you just play so I can get
out of here and get away from you?

604
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,667
-I told him I was sorry.
-Whatever.

605
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,419
Okay, you know what
we need to do?

606
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,338
We need to get
our heads right, okay?

607
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:55,007
Pull it together. As a team.

608
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,425
The three of us.

609
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,470
You're up, big man. Bring us home.

610
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:02,515
I got you, buddy. I promise.

611
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,872
-What's it say?
-He can't read.

612
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,962
"Lose map of galaxy.
Go back two spaces."

613
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,561
I'm freezing my ass off.

614
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,481
Forty degrees? Those savages.

615
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,749
Yes. Nine.

616
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:14,086
-Good roll.
-Good roll?

617
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:17,006
-Nine's a great roll.
-I meant great.

618
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,552
It's gold.

619
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:29,268
"Shooting star.
Make a wish as it passes."

620
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,271
That's gotta be the best card
in the whole game.

621
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:35,441
I'm almost to the end, look.
A few more and I win.

622
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:38,277
I hope you win.
I don't care who wins.

623
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,613
-Because you never win at anything.
-Hey.

624
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,615
That's why he cheats,
he can never win.

625
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:43,991
-No, I don't.
-You do.

626
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,743
And you almost got me killed.

627
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,579
-It wasn't my fault.
-It's not your fault?

628
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:51,373
How is it not your fault?
This is all your fault.

629
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,000
Everything's your fault.

630
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,835
It's your fault Mom and Dad
got divorced.

631
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:57,296
-Hey.
-You suck.

632
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,591
Danny.

633
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,768
I get my wish now, don't I?

634
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,312
Yeah.

635
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,496
Don't do it.

636
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,916
Don't do what?

637
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,834
Don't wish what you're thinking.

638
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,836
You don't know what I'm thinking.

639
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,838
Yeah, well, I can tell it ain't good.

640
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:47,596
Listen. No matter how good an idea
seems like when you're angry...

641
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,391
...it never is. You gotta trust me
on this one, Walter.

642
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,033
What'd you wish for?

643
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,494
-I can't tell you.
-Tell me.

644
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:13,372
You know the rules about wishing.
If I told you, it won't--

645
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,873
Tell me what you wished for.

646
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,917
Get off me.

647
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:23,841
Danny.

648
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,646
The card worked.

649
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,233
Yeah. It worked, congratulations.

650
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,236
We're stuck in space now forever.

651
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,405
Leave him alone.

652
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,079
What did you wish for?

653
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:59,001
-This.
-You wished for a football?

654
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,754
Signed by Brett Favre.

655
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,589
Why'd you wish for a football?

656
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,674
You could have
just wished the game over.

657
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,551
You could have wished us
out of here.

658
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:11,347
I was under a lot of pressure.
He was yelling at me.

659
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,392
Why were you yelling at him?

660
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,483
Okay, guys.

661
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,526
Here's the thing.

662
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,739
I've played this game before.

663
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:33,243
Okay? I played it
with my own brother 15 years ago.

664
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:37,289
-You're a player?
-Yeah. Just like you guys.

665
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,167
We were fighting a lot back then.

666
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:43,253
And when the game started,
it got even worse.

667
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:47,549
Every time we spun, we got madder
and madder at one another.

668
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,219
And then I landed on the star space.

669
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,262
The same one
that Walter just landed on.

670
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:58,143
Well, I was so mad at him,
that when the star passed...

671
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,105
...I made my wish.

672
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,482
What'd you wish for?

673
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,610
I wished that my brother
had never been born.

674
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,987
Oh, my God.

675
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,031
Soon as I did it, I felt horrible.

676
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,409
I thought, you know,
if I could spin again...

677
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:17,496
...maybe l-- I could land on another
star space and--And wish him back.

678
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,832
But the game wouldn't let me...

679
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,584
...because it wasn't my turn.

680
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,295
Walter.

681
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,673
There are some games...

682
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:30,008
...you can't play alone.

683
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:32,970
So, what do we do now?

684
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:37,266
We go back downstairs and
we finish this thing once and for all.

685
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,852
No more cheating.
No more arguing.

686
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:43,021
All you guys have to do
is spin a few more times.

687
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,441
I'll help you fight off
whatever comes out.

688
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,276
Deal?

689
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:50,112
-Deal.
-Deal.

690
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:52,865
Is it getting hot in here?

691
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,953
You blew out the pilot light
on the furnace, right?

692
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,669
Stay put.

693
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,399
Zorgons.

694
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,820
My gerbil was in there.

695
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,156
This is bad.

696
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,908
This is very bad.

697
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,827
Why? We didn't get eaten.

698
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,704
Where did you leave the game?

699
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,876
In the living room.

700
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,628
Great.

701
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:51,423
The game's our only way home,
and now the Zorgons are burning it.

702
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,551
There is one thing we can do.

703
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,934
Waiting for an invitation?
Come on.

704
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:15,072
-Put your back into it.
-Come on.

705
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,952
Why are we doing this?

706
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,641
Walter?

707
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,321
You guys actually
set the house on fire!

708
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,657
-Lisa's back.
-Lisa's unfrozen.

709
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,159
You're okay. You're okay, Lisa.

710
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,663
Get off me! Get off me!
Try and find the fire extinguisher!

711
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,666
-No, Lisa, wait. No, Lisa, wait.
-No, Lisa, no.

712
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,794
-Stop! Lisa, don't.
-The Zorgons are attracted to fire.

713
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:12,296
Lisa, stop.

714
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,505
No, Lisa, don't do it!

715
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,799
Lisa, don't do that.
We gotta keep the fire.

716
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:19,761
-The Zorgons are attracted to fire!
-Lisa, wait. No, Lisa, don't do it.

717
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,471
No, Lisa.

718
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,977
-Great.
-Now we'll never get the game back.

719
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:31,023
Okay. Don't worry. They're back.

720
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:34,443
-Who the hell are you?
-The astronaut.

721
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,695
From the game we're in.

722
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,405
Danny spun me.

723
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:50,626
What is that? What is that?

724
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,836
What's going on? Where are we?

725
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,340
Somebody please
talk to me right now!

726
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,470
All right, they're arming the harpoons.
They're gonna board us.

727
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,639
-What's gonna board us?
-Guys, look alive.

728
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,641
-What's gonna board us?
-The Zorgons.

729
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,935
-What's a Zorgon?
-They're lizard-men. They eat meat.

730
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,562
We're meat!

731
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:19,404
-Come on, let's hide downstairs!
-Okay, listen, when they dock...

732
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:22,115
...I'Il sneak on the ship and
steal the game. Got it?

733
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,450
-Hang on.
-What?

734
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:26,453
-Did she say downstairs?
-Oh, no.

735
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:39,966
Hey, hey.

736
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,928
Just stay with us,
and everything will be okay.

737
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,433
I'll never leave you.

738
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,900
Move, move, move.

739
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,280
Go, go.

740
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:43,697
Okay. It's gotten
pretty serious out there.

741
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,782
I need you guys to hide in here.

742
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,784
I'll keep in touch with these.

743
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,536
They won't work.
Danny broke them.

744
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:52,748
He pulled off the antenna.
They're completely destroyed.

745
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,293
Testing.

746
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,712
It works.

747
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,840
Listen, keep the volume low.

748
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,508
Only use that if you need me.

749
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,344
Wa-- Wait, where are you going?

750
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,638
I'm gonna go find the game.

751
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,526
He has gorgeous eyes.

752
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:25,864
What?

753
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,659
He obviously feels
very protective over me.

754
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,329
I just....

755
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,372
I just feel so safe around him.

756
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,666
Zorgons.

757
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,293
Oh, my God.

758
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:42,130
The place is crawling with them.
They're all over the basement.

759
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:46,009
Wait, I think in the corner
I see the game.

760
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,803
Yeah, the box is right there.

761
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,556
Hang on, I'm-- I'm gonna get closer.

762
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,227
Did he get the game?

763
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,362
-Hello?
-What's going on?

764
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,072
Are you there? Hello?

765
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,324
-What's happening?
-Hello?

766
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:10,742
Is he dead?

767
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,612
The game was right there.

768
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,616
It was right across from the furnace.
I couldn't get it.

769
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:55,412
There's too many of them down there.
They're all over the basement.

770
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,622
Are there any upstairs?

771
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,333
Not yet. But as soon as
they're done down there....

772
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,419
It's okay. You tried your hardest.

773
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,130
-We believe in you.
-Will you please?

774
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,425
Okay.

775
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,636
-The dumbwaiter.
-What?

776
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,472
The dumbwaiter is across
from the furnace.

777
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,308
It's a little elevator.

778
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,727
You could sneak right in it...

779
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,812
...we'll lower you down...

780
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,772
...you could grab the game...

781
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,983
...and we'll pull you right back up.

782
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,152
So easy.

783
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,987
Right, Walter?

784
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,448
Yeah, but he's too big.

785
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,825
Yeah.

786
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,827
It was a good plan, though.

787
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:37,579
It was a great plan.

788
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:38,997
Yeah, it was.

789
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,582
It was.

790
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,918
Too bad he wouldn't fit.

791
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,337
I wouldn't even fit.

792
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:53,011
I sure wish we knew someone
that was small enough.

793
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,182
Do we really need the game?

794
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,653
How you doing in there?

795
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,948
Okay.

796
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:16,368
Listen to me.
It's gonna be real easy, okay?

797
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:20,038
Just gonna lower you down there,
grab the game, and we'll pull you up.

798
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:21,831
Yeah.

799
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,250
Northing's gonna happen
to you, okay?

800
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,795
-Yeah.
-Because I'm your brother.

801
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,422
And that's what
being a brother means.

802
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,883
Means I'll never let
anything happen to you.

803
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:35,178
-Okay?
-Yeah.

804
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:38,848
Okay. This is just gonna
take a few seconds, okay?

805
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,810
-Hey, Walter?
-Yeah?

806
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,396
I'm sorry I cheated.

807
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:46,564
I know.

808
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:55,198
-You ready to do this?
-I'm ready.

809
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,591
He's right there.

810
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:58,053
Guys, why did you stop?

811
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,818
Guys, come on.

812
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,071
I'm not at the bottom yet.

813
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:28,166
Help me. Come on.

814
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,420
That's it. Pull, pull.
Come on, come on.

815
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,464
Go. Go.

816
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:44,015
They're back.
They're coming up the stairs.

817
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,226
Get out of here. Go on.

818
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:47,769
Go, go, go.

819
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,025
Oh, no.

820
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,486
Guys.

821
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,489
It was just the box.

822
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:38,588
Wait. I see the game.

823
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:41,466
It's on the Zorgon ship.

824
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:48,932
But I think I can get it.

825
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:52,977
Danny, do not get on that ship.

826
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,480
Just stay put.
We'll come and get you.

827
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,123
Danny.

828
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,709
Danny. Danny, listen to me.

829
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:00,628
The Zorgons are up here.
Just stay put.

830
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,797
The pulley broke--
--figure out--

831
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:06,175
We got rope-- So just stay put.

832
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:09,470
Danny. Danny, are you there?

833
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,431
Danny, the Zorgons are up here.

834
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:13,349
If you can hear me, listen.

835
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:17,145
We're not pulling you up right now.
Stay put.

836
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:19,022
We just saw one. Hold tight.

837
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,435
It's just a goat. It's just a goat.

838
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,771
It's just a--

839
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:03,608
It's not a goat. It's not a goat.
It's not a goat.

840
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:06,319
It's not a goat. It's not a goat.

841
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:11,407
It's not a goat.

842
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:52,216
Guys, pull me up.

843
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:58,723
They got goats with four eyes.

844
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,023
Guys! Quick!

845
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,192
I have the game!

846
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:54,278
Come on.

847
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:56,948
Walter.

848
01:23:57,115 --> 01:24:00,701
I told you I wouldn't let anything
happen to you. Come on.

849
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,183
Emergency.

850
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:29,313
Alien life form.

851
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:31,440
Must destroy.

852
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:33,818
He still wants to kill me.

853
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:43,244
Use the card. Quick.

854
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,162
Reprogram.

855
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,516
Alien life form.

856
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,979
Must destroy.

857
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:39,967
Alien life form.

858
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,345
Must destroy.

859
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:50,102
Guess that's what
the reprogram card's for.

860
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,188
I like that card.

861
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:54,398
It's a good card.

862
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:57,652
Where's Lisa?

863
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,700
Lisa...

864
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:06,369
...is upstairs.

865
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:08,412
What fell?

866
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:15,044
Little excessive, but I like it.
Come on.

867
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,755
Come on, come on, come on.

868
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:26,389
Okay, spin it, buddy.

869
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,775
Almost there.

870
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,322
I got it.

871
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:47,284
"Flunk space academy.
Go back one space."

872
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,290
I'm not even gonna
comment on that.

873
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,461
My turn.

874
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:19,150
"Hit time warp. Go back three
spaces. Repeat last turn."

875
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,995
I get another wish.

876
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,767
Thanks for helping us out.

877
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:07,656
I wish the astronaut
had his brother back.

878
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,394
You wished for two of me?

879
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:38,813
No. I--

880
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,398
I wished the astronaut guy
had his brother back.

881
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:51,242
-Danny.
-Who are you?

882
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:53,410
It's me.

883
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,831
It's Walter. I'm your brother.

884
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:59,083
-What?
-Wha--?

885
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:01,335
No, you're not.

886
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:02,878
He is.

887
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,256
Yes.

888
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:08,217
I'm older, but I'm him.

889
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:11,178
-I came back for you.
-What's going on here?

890
01:29:57,976 --> 01:30:00,144
That was awesome.

891
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,195
Thank you.

892
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,364
I....

893
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:14,491
-I didn't--
-You did a good job.

894
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:17,119
You did better than I did.

895
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,580
Thanks.

896
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:22,416
Now, make sure
he gets home safe, okay?

897
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:24,752
Okay.

898
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:56,200
-He was me.
-Yeah.

899
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:58,535
Oh, my God. And I wanted to--

900
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:18,889
Ten. You need 10 to win.

901
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:21,308
Need a 10. Need a 10.

902
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:35,823
One. God, I suck.

903
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:48,335
"Would you like to swing on a star?
Move ahead nine spaces."

904
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:52,506
-Danny, you won.
-I won?

905
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:55,092
-He won?
-You won, Danny. You beat the game.

906
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,094
You won the game.
We can go home.

907
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,929
I reached Zathura!

908
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,724
"Game over.
Thank you for playing"?

909
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,144
-That's it?
-Now what?

910
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:06,830
I think we're home.

911
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:13,003
Walter!

912
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:19,468
Lisa!

913
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:31,021
It's a black hole!

914
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:34,149
Zathura is a black hole!

915
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:12,563
Danny!

916
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:20,946
No!

917
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:25,242
Two-run shot. Are you kidding me?

918
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,620
A's up 5-4. Keith Foulke
leads the bigs in home runs...

919
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:30,831
...given up by a reliever with six.

920
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,958
Bottom nine. Red Sox down, 5-4.

921
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:37,004
Octavio Dotel in for the save.
He ain't really saving a whole lot.

922
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:38,922
He walks "Big Papi" Ortiz...

923
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,967
...to tie up the inning.
Kevin Millar up next.

924
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:45,095
After an Ortiz walk, ninth inning....

925
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,265
Walter?

926
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:51,977
-Don't push that button.
-Let's get back to the here and now.

927
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:54,146
No way it's gonna
happen again, is it?

928
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:55,981
No way.
No, it doesn't happen again.

929
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:58,275
Millar pops out to left field.

930
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:13,123
Richard's back!

931
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,042
-I did it.
-You won the game.

932
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:17,586
-I won the game. I beat Zathura.
-We're home.

933
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:19,546
-We're home!
-We did it. We're home.

934
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,633
I distinctly remember asking you guys
not to kill each other.

935
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,093
Dad, it was so awesome.
There was this game...

936
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:27,971
-...it sent us to outer space.
-There was a black hole.

937
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,640
We almost had to stay forever.

938
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:33,018
-I stole the game from the Zorgons.
-And I saw myself older.

939
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,687
Sounds like a lot of fun.

940
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:38,398
It's almost 3:00,
and Mom's gonna be here any minute.

941
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:41,568
Grab all games and books,
whatever you wanna take to her house.

942
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,570
Come on, get ready to go.

943
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:49,117
Good throw. Right to the chest.
Catch this one.

944
01:35:50,536 --> 01:35:52,329
-Caught it.
-Nice.

945
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:57,542
All right, ready? Here we go.

946
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:01,088
Brett Favre takes the snap.
He's looking. It's a great pass.

947
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:03,507
-Touchdown.
-Touchdown.

948
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,094
-Just a second, Mom.
-Hey, Mom.

949
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:12,015
What happened to the football
signed by Brett Favre?

950
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:15,227
-It's gone.
-What happened to it?

951
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:17,020
It never happened.

952
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,772
Oh, right.

953
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:23,277
We never speak of this. Okay?

954
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,655
-Never happened.
-Never happened.

955
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,785
Still think I have gorgeous eyes?

956
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:34,538
-Walter.
-What?
