1
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,188
Will!

2
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:28,733
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

3
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,195
You look beautiful.

4
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:36,950
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

5
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,328
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!

6
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,915
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

7
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,211
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

8
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:51,881
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

9
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:58,888
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

10
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,933
In fact, I do. Mr Mercer?

11
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,897
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

12
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:17,490
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- Is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

13
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:19,993
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?

14
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:23,746
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

15
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,959
And I have another one
for a Mr James Norrington.

16
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,211
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?

17
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:34,007
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

18
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,509
That wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.

19
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:40,263
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

20
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,808
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

21
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,686
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

22
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,023
The charge is "conspiring to set free

23
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:53,818
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

24
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:57,697
and condemned to death,
for which the..."

25
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,451
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

26
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:07,081
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

27
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,167
Captain.

28
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:13,004
Captain Jack Sparrow.

29
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:15,965
Captain Jack Sparrow.

30
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,259
Yes, I thought you might.

31
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:25,308
<i>Fifteen men on a dead man's chest</i>

32
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:30,230
<i>Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum</i>

33
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:35,652
<i>Drink and the devil</i>
<i>had done for the rest</i>

34
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:40,406
<i>Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum</i>

35
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,181
Prisoners, come on!

36
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:45,281
Sorry, mate.

37
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,578
Mind if we make a little side trip?

38
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,748
I didn't think so.

39
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:03,842
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,

40
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,969
were overcome.

41
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:10,849
You got what you went in for, then?

42
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,354
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

43
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,816
were expecting something
a bit more shiny,

44
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:24,112
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

45
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:26,739
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.

46
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:29,534
- And the hurricane.
- Aye.

47
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:35,373
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

48
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,502
- Shiny.
- Aye, shiny.

49
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,630
Is that how you're all feeling?

50
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:48,094
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

51
00:07:48,595 --> 00:07:50,471
Walk the plank.

52
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:53,558
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.

53
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:57,020
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

54
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:08,740
- You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.

55
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,037
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.

56
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:18,041
It is a drawing of a key.

57
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,341
Gentlemen,

58
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,343
what do keys do?

59
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,221
Keys

60
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:33,681
unlock things?

61
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:37,602
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

62
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,939
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

63
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:42,649
No.

64
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:47,111
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

65
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:51,074
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

66
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:55,620
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

67
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:58,039
So we're going after this key.

68
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:01,459
You're not making any sense at all.

69
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,920
Any more questions?

70
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:06,548
So do we have a heading?

71
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,759
A heading.

72
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:13,221
Set sail in a

73
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:16,224
general

74
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:22,856
that-way direction.

75
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,107
Captain?

76
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,945
Come on, snap to and make sail.
You know how this works. Go on.

77
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,784
Have you noticed lately

78
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:39,497
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

79
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:42,375
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

80
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,461
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

81
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:49,424
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

82
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:06,191
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

83
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,610
Those won't be necessary.

84
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:17,160
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

85
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:23,208
We wish for you to act as our agent

86
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,420
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

87
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,881
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?

88
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:32,926
We've had dealings in the past.

89
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:37,514
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

90
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:39,974
What mark did he leave on you?

91
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,397
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

92
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,525
I would like you to go to him

93
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:53,154
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

94
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:55,990
Recover. At the point of a sword?

95
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,576
Bargain.

96
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,001
Letters of marque.

97
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:10,839
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.

98
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:15,176
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

99
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:20,723
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

100
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:22,892
Freedom.

101
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,188
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

102
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:29,148
The world is shrinking,

103
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:32,652
the blank edges of the map filled in.

104
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,614
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

105
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:39,492
Not unlike you, Mr Turner.

106
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:42,412
You and your fiancée
face the hangman's noose.

107
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:47,876
- So you get Jack and the <i>Black Pearl.</i>
- The <i>Black Pearl?</i>

108
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,172
- The property you want that he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.

109
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:56,342
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

110
00:11:56,426 --> 00:12:00,013
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

111
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,724
A compass?

112
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,976
You know it.

113
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:10,690
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

114
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,426
Why is the rum always gone?

115
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:49,604
That's why.

116
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,570
As you were, gents.

117
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,649
Time's run out, Jack.

118
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:55,795
Bootstrap.

119
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,047
Bill Turner.

120
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:05,180
You look good, Jack.

121
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,147
Is this a dream?

122
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,648
No.

123
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:19,319
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

124
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:29,704
You got the <i>Pearl</i> back, I see.

125
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:34,250
I had some help retrieving the <i>Pearl,</i>
by the way.

126
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,879
Your son.

127
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,423
William?

128
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:43,593
He ended up a pirate after all.

129
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:48,389
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

130
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:50,642
He sent me.

131
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:54,646
Davy Jones.

132
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,400
So it's you, then.

133
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:04,322
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?

134
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,407
I chose it.

135
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:11,496
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

136
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,833
I stood up for you.

137
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,836
Everything went wrong after that.

138
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:24,342
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

139
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,345
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

140
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,973
Unable to move.

141
00:15:30,932 --> 00:15:33,309
Unable to die, Jack.

142
00:15:33,393 --> 00:15:38,982
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

143
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,818
I would trade anything for it.

144
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:47,115
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

145
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:49,868
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

146
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:52,579
He raised the <i>Pearl</i>
from the depths for you.

147
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:54,747
13 years, you've been her captain.

148
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:56,749
- Technically...
- Jack.

149
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,252
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

150
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,088
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

151
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:06,509
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

152
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:09,012
The <i>Flying Dutchman</i>
already has a captain...

153
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:11,431
Then it's the locker for you!

154
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:14,726
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

155
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:19,147
and drag the <i>Pearl</i> back to the depths
and you along with it.

156
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:24,652
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

157
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,530
I already told you, Jack.

158
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,826
Your time is up.

159
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:34,746
It comes now,

160
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:40,168
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

161
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:52,555
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

162
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,933
On deck! Scurry!

163
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:59,604
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

164
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:03,441
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

165
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:07,946
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

166
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:11,407
- Do we have a heading?
- Run! Land.

167
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:20,250
- Which port?
- I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.

168
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,843
- Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- No, no!

169
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:32,220
Leave it!

170
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:35,306
Run.

171
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:39,269
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!

172
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:49,487
Jack?

173
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:55,034
For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?

174
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:56,870
Nothing.

175
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:14,489
- Here, now, you can't be here.
- I think you'll find he can.

176
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:16,032
Mr Swann!

177
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:18,201
Governor Swann, still.

178
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:21,538
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

179
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:25,250
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

180
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,504
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

181
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:32,131
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

182
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:35,885
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

183
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:38,513
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?

184
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,890
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow

185
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:44,894
does not mean
he would do the same for anyone else.

186
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:48,398
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

187
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:52,443
I have faith in you.

188
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:55,154
Both of you.

189
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:59,367
Where will you find him?

190
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,205
Tortuga. I'll start there
and I won't stop searching till I find him.

191
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:08,042
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

192
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:11,462
- Properly?
- Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

193
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:16,593
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

194
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:27,604
- I'll wait for you.
- Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

195
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:39,240
Captain Jack Sparrow?

196
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:44,662
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

197
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:48,583
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

198
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:53,046
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

199
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:55,131
Jack Sparrow?

200
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,300
I haven't seen him in a month.

201
00:20:57,383 --> 00:21:01,179
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

202
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:04,766
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

203
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,519
but there's an island
just south of the straits

204
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:10,438
where I trade spice for

205
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:12,649
delicious long pork.

206
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:18,363
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.

207
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:20,782
A ship with black sails.

208
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:30,166
My brother will take you ashore.

209
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:43,930
- What's wrong? The beach is there.
- <i>C'est trop dangereux.</i>

210
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:47,475
- What?
- <i>C'est trop dangereux. Je vous I'avais dit.</i>

211
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:50,979
<i>Bon voyage. Monsieur.</i>

212
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:18,464
Jack!

213
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:20,550
Jack Sparrow!

214
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,474
Marty!

215
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,060
Cotton!

216
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,022
Anybody?

217
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,946
A familiar face.

218
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,823
Don't eat me.

219
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:46,910
- I'm not going to eat you.
- Don't eat me.

220
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:49,579
No. Don't eat me.

221
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:02,509
Gibbs.

222
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:34,791
Come on! Let's go!

223
00:23:37,836 --> 00:23:39,712
Come on! Who wants it?

224
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,884
I can do this all day!

225
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,783
Jack?

226
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:53,286
Jack Sparrow!

227
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:55,955
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.

228
00:25:04,714 --> 00:25:06,674
Jack, it's me.

229
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:08,092
Will Turner.

230
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:17,018
Tell them to let me down!

231
00:25:19,145 --> 00:25:21,147
...eensy-weensy.

232
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:29,364
...eunuchy. Snip, snip.

233
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:33,409
Eunuchy.

234
00:25:36,246 --> 00:25:38,706
Jack, the compass.
That's all I need.

235
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,876
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for helping you.

236
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,295
She faces the gallows!

237
00:25:51,928 --> 00:25:53,721
Savvy?

238
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:02,438
Save me.

239
00:26:02,522 --> 00:26:04,607
Jack, what did you tell them?

240
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,734
No!

241
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,445
What about Elizabeth?

242
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:11,114
Jack!

243
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:16,202
That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.

244
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:20,665
- We don't bite.
- Go on. We won't bite you.

245
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:25,753
Come quickly.

246
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:29,132
- Tell me what's happening.
- Our name still has some standing.

247
00:26:29,215 --> 00:26:32,552
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.

248
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:34,804
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

249
00:26:34,888 --> 00:26:36,931
We cannot count on William Turner.

250
00:26:37,015 --> 00:26:40,185
- Come!
- He's better than you give him credit for.

251
00:26:40,268 --> 00:26:43,688
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only -

252
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:46,107
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

253
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:47,901
Even if Will succeeds,

254
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:54,073
do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

255
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:58,578
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

256
00:26:58,661 --> 00:27:03,750
- A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
- Then there is nothing left for you here.

257
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:13,051
Wait inside.

258
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:16,137
Captain?

259
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,642
Captain.

260
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:28,775
Evening, Governor.

261
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:30,860
Shame, that.

262
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,071
He was carrying this.

263
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:35,865
It's a letter to the king.

264
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:38,284
- It's from you.
- No...

265
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:43,873
Elizabeth.

266
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:46,960
What are you doing?

267
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:52,173
- Where is she?
- Who?

268
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:14,112
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

269
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:16,489
as your father believes.

270
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:19,951
Then what is?

271
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:23,288
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

272
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:28,668
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.

273
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:31,963
- I'm here to negotiate.
- I'm listening.

274
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:36,801
I'm listening intently.

275
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:41,097
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.

276
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:45,935
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.

277
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,730
Or else I would not still be here.

278
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:52,859
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

279
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:56,654
- It will do you no good.
- Do explain.

280
00:28:56,738 --> 00:29:01,534
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

281
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:05,872
- There is something you need to know.
- I see.

282
00:29:05,955 --> 00:29:09,083
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

283
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:12,337
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

284
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:15,507
But you mustn't worry.

285
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:19,427
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

286
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:22,013
My desires are not so provincial.

287
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:27,018
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.

288
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:32,315
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

289
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:39,656
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.

290
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:41,908
So I did.

291
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:46,162
A marriage interrupted

292
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:51,167
or fate intervenes?

293
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:55,171
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

294
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:57,799
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Really?

295
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:00,635
To ensure Mr Turner's freedom, then,

296
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:04,264
I'll still want that compass.

297
00:30:04,347 --> 00:30:07,976
Consider that in your calculations.

298
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:30,665
I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.

299
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:33,459
And I say it was me being clever.

300
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:37,297
Ain't that right, poochie?

301
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,551
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine
Providence what inspired you to be clever?

302
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:43,803
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

303
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:49,184
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?

304
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:53,897
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

305
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,775
- You know you can't read.
- It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

306
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:03,364
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...

307
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,910
Look.

308
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:09,078
There it is.

309
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,793
What's got into him?

310
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:18,004
Must have seen a catfish.

311
00:31:25,178 --> 00:31:27,347
Stupid mongrel!

312
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:45,198
Come on!

313
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:56,543
- It's ours for the taking.
- Tide's coming in. That should help.

314
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:59,420
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

315
00:31:59,504 --> 00:32:01,381
There's the truth of it!

316
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,933
Suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,

317
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:15,228
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

318
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:17,981
Amen to that.

319
00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:36,207
Thank you.

320
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:56,352
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

321
00:32:56,436 --> 00:32:58,897
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

322
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,567
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

323
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,778
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

324
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:12,577
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,

325
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:18,625
and they intend to do him the honour
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

326
00:33:22,295 --> 00:33:24,756
They'll roast him and eat him.

327
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:27,592
Where's the rest of the crew?

328
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:32,263
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

329
00:33:34,557 --> 00:33:36,768
The feast is about to begin.

330
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:39,562
Jack's life will end

331
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:41,981
when the drums stop.

332
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:46,319
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?

333
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:51,407
No, no. Oi! No, no.

334
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:54,619
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

335
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:56,830
I am Chief. Want big fire.

336
00:33:56,913 --> 00:33:59,123
Come on.

337
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:04,796
<i>Tout de suite.</i>
Come on. More wood.

338
00:35:13,406 --> 00:35:15,408
Bugger.

339
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:27,253
A little seasoning, eh?

340
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:42,685
Well done.

341
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:25,395
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!

342
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:30,608
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the <i>Black Pearl!</i>

343
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:33,444
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

344
00:36:33,528 --> 00:36:35,864
About six would do.

345
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,244
Oh, dear.

346
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:47,375
- Hurry!
- Come on!

347
00:36:51,129 --> 00:36:53,548
Come on! Is that all you got?

348
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:03,725
Wait. Stop.

349
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:06,227
Stop.

350
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:21,034
- What are they doing?
- Stop.

351
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:29,501
Snake!

352
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:48,770
Move!

353
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:17,173
Well, go on, go get them.

354
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,973
No, no. Oi! No, no!

355
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:28,977
Not good.

356
00:38:45,243 --> 00:38:47,495
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

357
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:08,266
Roll the cage!

358
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:10,727
Come on!

359
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:40,215
- Lift the cage! Hurry!
- Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.

360
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:37,772
Run!

361
00:40:51,494 --> 00:40:54,247
This way, lads!

362
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:18,313
Take cover!

363
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,024
Stop it!

364
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,539
Bugger.

365
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:47,777
Haul loose the mooring line!

366
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:50,113
The mooring line!

367
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:53,867
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

368
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,287
- Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!

369
00:42:57,787 --> 00:42:59,914
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

370
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:03,459
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

371
00:43:03,543 --> 00:43:06,045
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

372
00:43:06,129 --> 00:43:09,048
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?

373
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:11,467
I won't leave without him.

374
00:43:20,602 --> 00:43:23,605
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!

375
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,157
Make ready to cast off!

376
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:41,289
Good doggy.

377
00:43:56,679 --> 00:44:03,019
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day you almost...

378
00:44:06,105 --> 00:44:08,316
Captain Jack Sparrow.

379
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:37,178
Let's get away from this island
and head out to open sea.

380
00:44:37,262 --> 00:44:41,766
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

381
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,977
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

382
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,230
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.

383
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:50,400
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

384
00:44:56,072 --> 00:44:58,449
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

385
00:44:58,533 --> 00:45:01,327
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?

386
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:03,955
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.

387
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:09,043
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

388
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:12,714
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

389
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:15,383
I must trade it for her freedom.

390
00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:20,346
- Mr Gibbs.
- Captain.

391
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,474
We have a need to travel upriver.

392
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:27,061
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

393
00:45:27,145 --> 00:45:30,940
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?

394
00:45:31,024 --> 00:45:34,819
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

395
00:45:34,903 --> 00:45:38,698
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

396
00:45:38,781 --> 00:45:40,700
William,

397
00:45:40,783 --> 00:45:42,827
I shall trade you the compass

398
00:45:42,911 --> 00:45:44,746
if you will help me

399
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,998
to find this.

400
00:45:50,668 --> 00:45:53,171
- You want me to find this?
- No.

401
00:45:54,297 --> 00:45:56,758
You want you to find this,

402
00:45:56,841 --> 00:46:00,929
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

403
00:46:01,012 --> 00:46:07,727
and/or locating in your discovering a way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.

404
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,647
Savvy?

405
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,734
This is going to save Elizabeth?

406
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:20,114
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

407
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:23,910
Not much.

408
00:46:23,993 --> 00:46:26,996
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

409
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:55,984
What's all this?

410
00:46:56,526 --> 00:47:01,573
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

411
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:04,993
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

412
00:47:05,535 --> 00:47:07,829
Is it, now? And you?

413
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:12,041
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

414
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,627
All the men, they can feel it.

415
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:18,464
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

416
00:47:18,548 --> 00:47:20,842
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.

417
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,511
A virgin too, likely as not.

418
00:47:23,595 --> 00:47:25,847
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

419
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:30,435
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

420
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:33,354
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

421
00:47:33,438 --> 00:47:37,484
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.

422
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:39,819
Enough! Enough!

423
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:44,199
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

424
00:47:44,282 --> 00:47:47,494
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

425
00:47:47,577 --> 00:47:49,746
A young woman, by the look of it.

426
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:52,457
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

427
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,293
Oh, and she's probably naked.

428
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:27,826
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

429
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:30,286
Well, if you believe such things,

430
00:48:30,787 --> 00:48:33,581
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones -

431
00:48:33,665 --> 00:48:38,253
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

432
00:48:38,336 --> 00:48:41,965
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

433
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:45,760
The kraken.

434
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:51,933
They say the stench of its breath is like...

435
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:55,520
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

436
00:48:55,603 --> 00:49:01,568
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odour of a thousand rotting corpses.

437
00:49:03,444 --> 00:49:05,947
If you believe such things.

438
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:08,867
And the key will spare him that?

439
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:12,453
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

440
00:49:12,537 --> 00:49:15,039
Bad enough even to go visit

441
00:49:15,957 --> 00:49:18,126
her.

442
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:20,086
Her?

443
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,172
Aye.

444
00:49:57,165 --> 00:50:00,877
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

445
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,923
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

446
00:50:05,006 --> 00:50:07,342
Were. Have been.

447
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,552
Before.

448
00:50:09,636 --> 00:50:12,597
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

449
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,183
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

450
00:50:16,017 --> 00:50:18,520
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

451
00:50:18,603 --> 00:50:19,938
Mind the boat.

452
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:23,024
Mind the boat.

453
00:50:34,786 --> 00:50:38,081
Jack Sparrow.

454
00:50:38,164 --> 00:50:40,291
Tia Dalma.

455
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:45,672
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

456
00:50:50,343 --> 00:50:52,303
You...

457
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:57,350
You have a touch of

458
00:50:57,433 --> 00:51:00,812
destiny about you,

459
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:02,772
William Turner.

460
00:51:04,524 --> 00:51:06,693
You know me?

461
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:09,404
You want to know me.

462
00:51:09,487 --> 00:51:14,117
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.

463
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,871
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

464
00:51:17,954 --> 00:51:20,123
- Come.
- Come.

465
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:28,339
What service may I do you?

466
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:33,011
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment.

467
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:38,600
Look.

468
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:42,187
An undead monkey.

469
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,439
Top that.

470
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:52,280
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

471
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:55,241
The payment is fair.

472
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:57,327
We're looking for this.

473
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,707
And what it goes to.

474
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:08,838
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

475
00:52:08,922 --> 00:52:12,383
Maybe. Why?

476
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:19,307
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

477
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:22,227
Or do you know,

478
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:26,231
but are loath to claim it as your own?

479
00:52:27,941 --> 00:52:29,984
Your key go to a chest.

480
00:52:30,568 --> 00:52:35,114
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

481
00:52:35,198 --> 00:52:38,117
- What is inside?
- Gold?

482
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:42,288
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

483
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:45,542
Nothing bad, I hope?

484
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:49,170
You know of Davy Jones,

485
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:50,797
yes?

486
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,675
A man of the sea.

487
00:52:53,758 --> 00:52:56,052
A great sailor,

488
00:52:56,135 --> 00:53:01,140
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

489
00:53:01,224 --> 00:53:04,227
What vexes all men?

490
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,273
What indeed?

491
00:53:08,815 --> 00:53:10,817
- The sea.
- Sums.

492
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,903
The dichotomy of good and evil.

493
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:16,239
A woman.

494
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:18,158
A woman.

495
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:20,326
He fell in love.

496
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:23,371
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

497
00:53:23,454 --> 00:53:27,417
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

498
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,878
See, it was a woman

499
00:53:29,961 --> 00:53:32,714
as changing and harsh

500
00:53:32,797 --> 00:53:36,217
and untamable as the sea.

501
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:38,720
Him never stopped loving her.

502
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:43,600
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

503
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:46,394
but not enough to cause him to die.

504
00:53:48,146 --> 00:53:52,609
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

505
00:53:52,692 --> 00:53:54,652
Him heart.

506
00:53:54,736 --> 00:53:56,821
Literally or figuratively?

507
00:53:56,905 --> 00:54:01,451
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

508
00:54:01,534 --> 00:54:03,536
Could he?

509
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:09,709
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

510
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:11,461
And so

511
00:54:11,544 --> 00:54:14,255
him carve out him heart,

512
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:19,552
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

513
00:54:20,428 --> 00:54:22,514
The key

514
00:54:22,597 --> 00:54:27,143
he keep with him at all times.

515
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:31,481
- You knew this.
- I did not. I didn't know where the key was.

516
00:54:31,564 --> 00:54:35,777
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the <i>Flying Dutchman,</i> grab the key,

517
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,613
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

518
00:54:38,696 --> 00:54:41,574
Let me see your hand.

519
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:57,632
The black spot!

520
00:54:58,675 --> 00:55:02,220
- The black spot!
- Black spot!

521
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:05,723
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

522
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:09,310
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

523
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:16,234
My little beauty, where are you?

524
00:55:16,317 --> 00:55:19,863
Such a long time in such a mess.

525
00:55:21,906 --> 00:55:24,784
Davy Jones cannot make port.

526
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:28,204
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

527
00:55:28,746 --> 00:55:32,000
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

528
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:34,627
and so you will carry land with you.

529
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:45,889
Dirt.

530
00:55:47,015 --> 00:55:50,685
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

531
00:55:53,021 --> 00:55:55,899
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

532
00:55:55,982 --> 00:55:58,902
If you don't want it, give it back.

533
00:55:59,402 --> 00:56:02,572
- No.
- Then it helps.

534
00:56:04,782 --> 00:56:09,829
It seems we have a need to find
the <i>Flying Dutchman.</i>

535
00:56:12,957 --> 00:56:16,794
A touch of destiny.

536
00:56:32,268 --> 00:56:34,813
That's the <i>Flying Dutchman?</i>

537
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:39,526
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

538
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:41,945
Do not underestimate her.

539
00:56:43,404 --> 00:56:47,826
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

540
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:51,371
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

541
00:56:51,454 --> 00:56:53,832
And if there are crewmen?

542
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:56,167
I cut down anyone in my path.

543
00:56:57,001 --> 00:56:59,921
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

544
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:03,007
Your chariot awaits you, Sire.

545
00:57:07,512 --> 00:57:13,268
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

546
00:57:13,351 --> 00:57:17,272
- It might save your life.
- Bon voyage!

547
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:23,820
Douse the lamps.

548
00:58:05,487 --> 00:58:06,571
Sailor.

549
00:58:06,654 --> 00:58:09,240
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!

550
00:58:09,324 --> 00:58:11,701
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

551
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:14,496
There's no use.
You've run aground.

552
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:15,955
No.

553
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,208
Beneath us.

554
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:21,461
Foul breath.

555
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:16,891
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

556
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:35,743
Get back! Get back!

557
01:00:07,317 --> 01:00:10,987
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

558
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:31,299
Do you fear death?

559
01:00:32,717 --> 01:00:37,555
Do you fear that dark abyss?

560
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:42,268
All your deeds laid bare.

561
01:00:43,144 --> 01:00:46,147
All your sins punished.

562
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:50,485
I can offer you

563
01:00:50,568 --> 01:00:53,029
an escape.

564
01:00:53,112 --> 01:00:56,199
Don't listen to him!

565
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:07,836
Do you not fear death?

566
01:01:10,296 --> 01:01:12,882
I'll take my chances, sir.

567
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:15,385
To the depths.

568
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:22,892
Cruel blackguard!

569
01:01:22,976 --> 01:01:25,145
Life is cruel.

570
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:28,857
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

571
01:01:29,357 --> 01:01:32,527
I offer you a choice.

572
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:35,321
Join my crew

573
01:01:35,405 --> 01:01:37,740
and postpone the judgment.

574
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:42,662
One hundred years before the mast.

575
01:01:44,956 --> 01:01:46,916
Will ye serve?

576
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,712
I will serve.

577
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:03,600
You are neither dead nor dying.

578
01:02:03,683 --> 01:02:06,311
What is your purpose here?

579
01:02:09,105 --> 01:02:12,275
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

580
01:02:13,401 --> 01:02:16,654
What is your purpose here?

581
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:19,949
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.

582
01:02:22,911 --> 01:02:25,497
Did he, now?

583
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:29,042
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

584
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:48,770
You have a debt to pay.

585
01:02:48,853 --> 01:02:52,273
You've been captain of the <i>Black Pearl</i>
for 13 years.

586
01:02:52,357 --> 01:02:54,442
That was our agreement.

587
01:02:54,526 --> 01:02:58,363
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

588
01:02:58,446 --> 01:03:02,242
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

589
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:05,578
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

590
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:08,289
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

591
01:03:11,209 --> 01:03:14,170
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.

592
01:03:14,254 --> 01:03:16,798
One soul is not equal to another.

593
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:24,138
We've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

594
01:03:24,222 --> 01:03:26,808
Price?

595
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:32,313
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

596
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:38,736
One hundred souls.

597
01:03:39,654 --> 01:03:41,447
Three days.

598
01:03:41,948 --> 01:03:45,827
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

599
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:49,038
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

600
01:03:49,122 --> 01:03:51,833
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

601
01:03:54,836 --> 01:03:56,838
Have you not met Will Turner?

602
01:03:56,921 --> 01:03:59,757
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

603
01:03:59,841 --> 01:04:02,218
Worth at least four.

604
01:04:02,302 --> 01:04:04,554
Maybe three and a half.

605
01:04:05,346 --> 01:04:08,349
And did I happen to mention

606
01:04:08,433 --> 01:04:10,894
he's in love?

607
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:14,355
With a girl.

608
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:16,858
Due to be married.

609
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:18,902
Betrothed.

610
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:24,574
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

611
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:29,579
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony. Eh?

612
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:38,379
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

613
01:04:38,463 --> 01:04:41,132
But I wonder, Sparrow,

614
01:04:41,216 --> 01:04:43,468
can you live with this?

615
01:04:44,177 --> 01:04:48,014
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

616
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:53,061
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

617
01:04:56,272 --> 01:04:58,316
Yep. I'm good with it.

618
01:04:58,399 --> 01:05:01,569
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean ink.

619
01:05:05,865 --> 01:05:08,618
Three days.

620
01:05:13,122 --> 01:05:15,291
Three days.

621
01:05:22,882 --> 01:05:25,802
- Mr Gibbs.
- Aye.

622
01:05:25,885 --> 01:05:28,513
I feel sullied and unusual.

623
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:34,394
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

624
01:05:34,477 --> 01:05:40,525
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.

625
01:05:40,608 --> 01:05:42,569
Tortuga.

626
01:05:43,653 --> 01:05:45,113
Tortuga.

627
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:52,745
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

628
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:56,082
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

629
01:05:56,166 --> 01:06:00,545
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

630
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:05,091
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.

631
01:06:05,175 --> 01:06:07,802
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

632
01:06:07,886 --> 01:06:13,349
An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.

633
01:06:14,058 --> 01:06:15,977
Sir!

634
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,794
She wants you to do something.

635
01:06:44,923 --> 01:06:47,592
She's trying to give a sign.

636
01:06:55,975 --> 01:06:58,478
Over there! Look for a sign!

637
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:05,401
Look, there! There it is!

638
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,446
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.

639
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:11,616
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

640
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:16,788
- That would be a bad sign.
- What's that over there?

641
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:38,309
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the <i>Black Pearl?</i>

642
01:07:38,393 --> 01:07:40,645
I've never sailed a day in me life.

643
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:43,898
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

644
01:07:43,982 --> 01:07:47,360
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!

645
01:07:47,443 --> 01:07:50,113
My wife ran off with my dog

646
01:07:50,572 --> 01:07:53,032
and I'm drunk for a month

647
01:07:53,116 --> 01:07:55,201
and I don't give an ass rat's

648
01:07:55,285 --> 01:07:57,245
if I live or die.

649
01:07:57,328 --> 01:08:00,373
- Perfect. Next!
- I know what I want. I know what I want...

650
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:04,586
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow's nest for you.

651
01:08:04,669 --> 01:08:06,838
- I know what I want.
- Next!

652
01:08:06,921 --> 01:08:12,552
Ever since I was a little lad,
I've always wanted to sail the seas forever.

653
01:08:12,635 --> 01:08:15,346
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

654
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:17,724
Thanks very much.

655
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:22,979
- How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us four.

656
01:08:26,441 --> 01:08:28,610
And what's your story?

657
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:31,196
My story.

658
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:36,367
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

659
01:08:36,451 --> 01:08:40,079
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

660
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:42,999
The pursuit cost me my crew,

661
01:08:43,082 --> 01:08:45,752
my commission,

662
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:48,004
and my life.

663
01:08:53,051 --> 01:08:57,889
- Commodore?
- No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

664
01:09:00,892 --> 01:09:03,478
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

665
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:08,775
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.

666
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:10,235
Lord.

667
01:09:10,318 --> 01:09:12,320
You didn't try to sail through it?

668
01:09:12,403 --> 01:09:14,948
So, do I make your crew

669
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:17,033
or not?

670
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:20,620
You haven't said where you're going.

671
01:09:20,703 --> 01:09:22,789
Somewhere nice?!

672
01:09:23,832 --> 01:09:26,251
So, am I worthy to serve

673
01:09:26,334 --> 01:09:29,128
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

674
01:09:31,589 --> 01:09:35,009
Or should I just kill you now?

675
01:09:41,141 --> 01:09:43,309
You're hired.

676
01:09:43,393 --> 01:09:47,397
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

677
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:51,025
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

678
01:10:04,205 --> 01:10:06,207
- Time to go.
- Aye!

679
01:10:50,835 --> 01:10:52,837
Thanks, mate.

680
01:10:58,551 --> 01:11:00,470
Carry on.

681
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:10,355
Come on, then! Who wants some?

682
01:11:10,438 --> 01:11:13,942
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

683
01:11:14,025 --> 01:11:16,319
Come on, who's first?

684
01:11:18,947 --> 01:11:22,492
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

685
01:11:49,144 --> 01:11:51,855
James Norrington.

686
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:55,859
What has the world done to you?

687
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:26,222
Heave!

688
01:12:26,473 --> 01:12:28,683
Heave!

689
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:31,352
Heave!

690
01:12:31,603 --> 01:12:33,521
Heave!

691
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:38,026
- Heave!
- Heave!

692
01:12:40,904 --> 01:12:44,908
Secure the mast tackle, Mr Turner!

693
01:12:47,911 --> 01:12:50,079
Set to it!

694
01:12:55,376 --> 01:12:58,296
- Step aside.
- Hey! Mind yourself!

695
01:12:58,713 --> 01:13:01,132
Let go, boy!

696
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,929
No.

697
01:13:13,895 --> 01:13:16,564
Haul that weevil to his feet.

698
01:13:22,111 --> 01:13:25,573
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!

699
01:13:25,657 --> 01:13:30,745
- No!
- Impeding me in my duties?

700
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:34,666
- You'll share the punishment.
- I'll take it all.

701
01:13:34,749 --> 01:13:37,126
Will you, now?

702
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:42,465
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

703
01:13:46,177 --> 01:13:48,138
My son.

704
01:13:53,059 --> 01:13:55,395
He's my son.

705
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:09,909
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

706
01:14:09,993 --> 01:14:13,872
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

707
01:14:18,793 --> 01:14:21,296
No. No, I won't!

708
01:14:21,379 --> 01:14:24,174
The cat's out of the bag, Mr Turner.

709
01:14:24,591 --> 01:14:30,054
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.

710
01:14:33,892 --> 01:14:36,269
No.

711
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:38,354
- Bosun!
- No!

712
01:15:22,565 --> 01:15:25,985
You had it easy, boy!

713
01:15:26,069 --> 01:15:29,030
- Will.
- I don't need your help.

714
01:15:30,782 --> 01:15:37,121
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh
from bone, with every swing.

715
01:15:37,205 --> 01:15:42,168
So I'm to understand
what you did was an act of compassion?

716
01:15:42,252 --> 01:15:44,379
Yes.

717
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:56,224
100 years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,

718
01:15:56,307 --> 01:16:00,186
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.

719
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:06,025
Once you've sworn an oath
to the <i>Dutchman,</i> there's no leaving it.

720
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:09,195
Not until your debt is paid.

721
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:11,739
I've sworn no oath.

722
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:15,618
You must get away.

723
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:18,788
Not until I find this.

724
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:22,333
The key.

725
01:16:29,549 --> 01:16:31,968
The dead man's chest.

726
01:16:33,136 --> 01:16:35,263
What do you know of this?

727
01:16:35,346 --> 01:16:40,059
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

728
01:16:40,143 --> 01:16:43,271
No, don't stab the heart.

729
01:16:43,354 --> 01:16:48,401
The <i>Dutchman</i> needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

730
01:16:48,485 --> 01:16:52,780
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

731
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:55,783
So the captain has the key?

732
01:16:56,993 --> 01:16:59,787
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

733
01:17:00,163 --> 01:17:02,957
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.

734
01:17:06,127 --> 01:17:07,962
Captain Sparrow!

735
01:17:08,046 --> 01:17:10,507
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

736
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:13,259
I'm here to find the man I love.

737
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:18,807
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

738
01:17:19,933 --> 01:17:24,062
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

739
01:17:24,145 --> 01:17:25,522
Elizabeth.

740
01:17:25,605 --> 01:17:28,024
Hide the rum.

741
01:17:28,107 --> 01:17:30,985
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.

742
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:34,155
- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

743
01:17:36,366 --> 01:17:39,619
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

744
01:17:39,702 --> 01:17:43,248
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but

745
01:17:43,331 --> 01:17:50,255
through unfortunate circumstances
that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

746
01:17:50,338 --> 01:17:55,051
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.

747
01:17:56,094 --> 01:17:58,012
Davy Jones?

748
01:17:59,472 --> 01:18:01,850
Oh, please.

749
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:05,395
The captain of the <i>Flying Dutchman?</i>

750
01:18:05,478 --> 01:18:08,857
- You look awful. What are you doing here?
- You hired me.

751
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,192
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

752
01:18:11,276 --> 01:18:14,154
- You smell funny.
- Jack!

753
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:17,365
All I want is to find Will.

754
01:18:20,743 --> 01:18:25,206
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?

755
01:18:26,124 --> 01:18:28,501
Of course.

756
01:18:28,585 --> 01:18:32,839
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.

757
01:18:33,464 --> 01:18:37,343
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well,

758
01:18:37,427 --> 01:18:40,680
- there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.

759
01:18:40,763 --> 01:18:43,099
A chest of unknown size and origin.

760
01:18:43,183 --> 01:18:48,104
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

761
01:18:49,522 --> 01:18:51,357
And whoever possesses that chest

762
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:55,403
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

763
01:18:55,487 --> 01:19:00,408
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

764
01:19:00,492 --> 01:19:04,078
You don't actually believe him, do you?

765
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:11,169
How would we find it?

766
01:19:13,338 --> 01:19:15,173
With this.

767
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:18,176
My compass is unique.

768
01:19:18,718 --> 01:19:21,930
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken".

769
01:19:22,931 --> 01:19:27,393
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

770
01:19:29,604 --> 01:19:32,398
Where does it point?

771
01:19:32,482 --> 01:19:37,278
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

772
01:19:40,365 --> 01:19:42,033
Jack.

773
01:19:43,952 --> 01:19:47,705
- Are you telling the truth?
- Every word, love.

774
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:50,250
And what you want most in this world

775
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:56,047
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

776
01:19:56,130 --> 01:20:01,094
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

777
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:18,987
- Mr Gibbs!
- Cap'n.

778
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:21,322
- We have our heading.
- Finally!

779
01:20:21,406 --> 01:20:25,994
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

780
01:20:26,077 --> 01:20:28,079
Miss Swann.

781
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:33,751
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

782
01:20:40,383 --> 01:20:45,263
There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it.

783
01:20:45,346 --> 01:20:48,057
I assure you, these are not necessary.

784
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:52,604
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

785
01:20:52,687 --> 01:20:56,191
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on Tortuga,

786
01:20:56,274 --> 01:21:00,236
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

787
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,239
and other fugitives from justice.

788
01:21:03,323 --> 01:21:05,158
"Justice"? Hardly.

789
01:21:05,241 --> 01:21:11,039
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.

790
01:21:11,539 --> 01:21:16,294
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

791
01:21:16,377 --> 01:21:20,340
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

792
01:21:20,423 --> 01:21:26,429
I find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board.

793
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:31,559
What do you want from me?

794
01:21:31,643 --> 01:21:34,813
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

795
01:21:34,896 --> 01:21:38,483
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

796
01:21:39,526 --> 01:21:42,070
To you, you mean.

797
01:21:45,698 --> 01:21:48,451
Shall I remove these shackles?

798
01:21:51,663 --> 01:21:55,083
Do what you can for my daughter.

799
01:22:01,339 --> 01:22:06,302
So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

800
01:22:06,386 --> 01:22:10,265
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

801
01:22:15,937 --> 01:22:19,065
I wager ten years.

802
01:22:19,941 --> 01:22:22,277
I'll match ten years.

803
01:22:23,278 --> 01:22:24,988
Agreed.

804
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:30,743
Wondering how it's played?

805
01:22:30,827 --> 01:22:32,704
- I understand.
- Liar!

806
01:22:32,787 --> 01:22:38,376
It's a game of deception. But your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.

807
01:22:38,751 --> 01:22:41,796
- What are they wagering?
- The only thing we have.

808
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,257
Years of service.

809
01:22:46,384 --> 01:22:50,597
- So any crew member can be challenged?
- Aye. Anyone.

810
01:22:53,475 --> 01:22:56,227
I challenge Davy Jones.

811
01:23:15,872 --> 01:23:18,833
I accept, mate.

812
01:23:30,386 --> 01:23:35,934
- The stakes?
- My soul. An eternity of servitude.

813
01:23:36,017 --> 01:23:38,228
No!

814
01:23:40,396 --> 01:23:41,940
Against?

815
01:23:43,399 --> 01:23:45,401
I want this.

816
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:02,460
- How do you know of the key?
- That's not part of the game, is it?

817
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:08,258
You can still walk away.

818
01:24:32,949 --> 01:24:36,035
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

819
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:39,038
No! Don't do this.

820
01:24:40,957 --> 01:24:43,751
The die is cast.

821
01:24:43,835 --> 01:24:46,921
I bid three twos.

822
01:24:47,005 --> 01:24:49,174
It's your bid, Captain.

823
01:24:55,472 --> 01:24:58,475
Four fours.

824
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:10,695
Four fives.

825
01:25:10,778 --> 01:25:12,489
Six threes.

826
01:25:22,165 --> 01:25:25,335
Seven fives.

827
01:25:49,234 --> 01:25:51,528
Eight fives.

828
01:25:56,241 --> 01:25:59,744
Welcome to the crew, lad.

829
01:26:01,913 --> 01:26:04,916
Twelve fives.

830
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:06,835
Twelve fives.

831
01:26:06,918 --> 01:26:09,754
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

832
01:26:11,089 --> 01:26:14,676
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

833
01:26:18,138 --> 01:26:23,017
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

834
01:26:24,936 --> 01:26:29,149
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore

835
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:33,570
the very next time we make port!

836
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:44,706
Fool. Why did you do that?

837
01:26:46,249 --> 01:26:48,459
I couldn't let you lose.

838
01:26:48,543 --> 01:26:51,296
It was never about winning or losing.

839
01:26:53,673 --> 01:26:55,133
The key.

840
01:26:56,801 --> 01:26:59,679
You just wanted to know where it was.

841
01:27:19,282 --> 01:27:21,910
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

842
01:27:25,914 --> 01:27:27,999
Captain's orders.

843
01:29:17,817 --> 01:29:20,403
Here. Take this, too.

844
01:29:21,362 --> 01:29:24,741
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

845
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,453
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

846
01:29:28,536 --> 01:29:31,581
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

847
01:29:36,336 --> 01:29:40,048
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

848
01:29:40,131 --> 01:29:46,346
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

849
01:29:47,263 --> 01:29:51,601
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

850
01:29:53,311 --> 01:29:55,980
You owe me nothing, Will.

851
01:29:56,064 --> 01:29:58,274
Now go.

852
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:02,070
They'll know you helped me.

853
01:30:03,446 --> 01:30:05,448
What more can they do to me?

854
01:30:11,287 --> 01:30:13,540
I take this with a promise.

855
01:30:13,623 --> 01:30:16,042
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

856
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:20,004
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

857
01:30:21,506 --> 01:30:23,842
I will not abandon you.

858
01:30:26,469 --> 01:30:29,055
I promise.

859
01:30:43,194 --> 01:30:45,321
- Beckett?
- Yes, they're signed.

860
01:30:45,405 --> 01:30:49,450
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

861
01:30:49,534 --> 01:30:53,288
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

862
01:30:53,663 --> 01:30:57,458
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

863
01:30:57,542 --> 01:31:00,086
Of course.

864
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:03,923
- He wants the chest.
- Yes, he did say something about a chest.

865
01:31:04,007 --> 01:31:07,635
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

866
01:31:07,719 --> 01:31:11,473
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

867
01:31:11,556 --> 01:31:15,226
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

868
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:18,563
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

869
01:31:18,646 --> 01:31:20,773
Brace the foreyard!

870
01:31:20,857 --> 01:31:24,068
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

871
01:31:24,152 --> 01:31:26,070
- Persuasion.
- Friendly?

872
01:31:26,154 --> 01:31:27,780
Decidedly not.

873
01:31:27,864 --> 01:31:33,453
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one
with the prize - full pardon.

874
01:31:33,536 --> 01:31:35,872
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

875
01:31:35,955 --> 01:31:38,666
and the East India Trading Company."

876
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:41,044
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

877
01:31:41,127 --> 01:31:43,630
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No.

878
01:31:43,713 --> 01:31:46,049
Persuade me.

879
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:49,928
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

880
01:31:52,305 --> 01:31:56,017
As I said, persuade me.

881
01:32:10,281 --> 01:32:12,742
It's a curious thing.

882
01:32:13,827 --> 01:32:19,499
There was a time I would have wanted you
to look like that while thinking about me.

883
01:32:19,582 --> 01:32:21,960
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

884
01:32:22,043 --> 01:32:24,879
Don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

885
01:32:29,551 --> 01:32:31,845
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancé

886
01:32:31,928 --> 01:32:35,974
ended up on the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>
in the first place?

887
01:33:00,456 --> 01:33:03,751
Strange to come upon a longboat
so far out in open water.

888
01:33:03,835 --> 01:33:07,255
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

889
01:33:07,338 --> 01:33:10,467
And what are we running from?

890
01:33:15,263 --> 01:33:18,057
That dress. Where did you get it?

891
01:33:18,141 --> 01:33:19,851
It was found aboard the ship.

892
01:33:19,934 --> 01:33:24,439
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

893
01:33:24,522 --> 01:33:27,942
- That's foolish.
- Yes. Exceedingly foolish.

894
01:33:28,026 --> 01:33:34,032
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",

895
01:33:34,115 --> 01:33:36,117
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

896
01:33:36,201 --> 01:33:39,329
Off the books, of course.

897
01:33:39,412 --> 01:33:43,208
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

898
01:33:43,291 --> 01:33:46,169
- Why do you ask?
- Captain! A ship's been spotted.

899
01:33:46,252 --> 01:33:49,088
- Colours?
- She isn't flying any.

900
01:33:49,172 --> 01:33:51,174
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

901
01:34:02,644 --> 01:34:06,231
You will watch this.

902
01:34:13,363 --> 01:34:16,366
Let no joyful voice be heard!

903
01:34:18,493 --> 01:34:21,704
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

904
01:34:23,957 --> 01:34:29,712
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake

905
01:34:31,172 --> 01:34:33,341
the kraken.

906
01:34:33,758 --> 01:34:35,426
No!

907
01:34:52,318 --> 01:34:54,863
I've doomed us all.

908
01:34:55,321 --> 01:34:58,158
It's the <i>Flying Dutchman!</i>

909
01:35:03,079 --> 01:35:05,498
Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

910
01:35:05,582 --> 01:35:08,126
Must have hit a reef.

911
01:35:15,758 --> 01:35:18,803
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.

912
01:35:18,887 --> 01:35:22,390
- Free the rudder!
- Hard to port!

913
01:35:29,647 --> 01:35:33,151
- Kraken!
- Kraken!

914
01:35:46,623 --> 01:35:49,584
Here it is! Take it!

915
01:35:49,667 --> 01:35:51,669
Take it!

916
01:38:03,593 --> 01:38:08,139
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.

917
01:38:08,223 --> 01:38:10,725
I am the sea.

918
01:38:14,395 --> 01:38:17,649
You need time alone with your thoughts.

919
01:38:17,732 --> 01:38:20,276
- Brig!
- What of the survivors?

920
01:38:25,782 --> 01:38:29,160
There are no survivors.

921
01:38:49,347 --> 01:38:53,226
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

922
01:38:53,309 --> 01:38:56,020
Get me there first,
or there'll be the devil to pay.

923
01:38:56,104 --> 01:38:57,939
"First"?

924
01:38:58,022 --> 01:39:01,234
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

925
01:39:01,317 --> 01:39:03,278
Who told him of the key?

926
01:39:06,406 --> 01:39:08,575
Jack Sparrow.

927
01:39:26,926 --> 01:39:33,725
My intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.

928
01:39:33,808 --> 01:39:37,228
I just thought I'd be married by now.

929
01:39:37,312 --> 01:39:39,647
I'm so ready to be married.

930
01:39:47,197 --> 01:39:49,240
You know...

931
01:39:50,867 --> 01:39:56,289
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,

932
01:39:56,372 --> 01:40:04,881
and being captain of a ship, I could in fact
perform a "marr-i-age" right here.

933
01:40:04,964 --> 01:40:07,342
Right on this deck.

934
01:40:07,425 --> 01:40:09,385
Right now.

935
01:40:13,014 --> 01:40:15,308
No, thank you.

936
01:40:15,391 --> 01:40:16,935
Why not?

937
01:40:17,018 --> 01:40:20,772
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

938
01:40:20,855 --> 01:40:25,235
Except for a sense of honour
and decency and a moral centre.

939
01:40:25,693 --> 01:40:28,112
And personal hygiene.

940
01:40:29,572 --> 01:40:31,866
Trifles.

941
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:34,494
You will come over to my side. I know it.

942
01:40:34,577 --> 01:40:39,874
- You seem very certain.
- One word, love. Curiosity.

943
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:41,584
You long for freedom.

944
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:44,754
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

945
01:40:44,838 --> 01:40:47,924
To act on selfish impulse.

946
01:40:48,007 --> 01:40:50,760
You want to see what it's like.

947
01:40:50,844 --> 01:40:55,306
One day, you won't be able to resist.

948
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:58,434
Why doesn't your compass work?

949
01:41:00,061 --> 01:41:03,148
My compass works fine.

950
01:41:03,565 --> 01:41:05,358
Because you and I are alike,

951
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:08,695
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

952
01:41:08,778 --> 01:41:12,073
- To do the right thing.
- I love those moments.

953
01:41:12,574 --> 01:41:14,868
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

954
01:41:14,951 --> 01:41:20,540
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.

955
01:41:20,623 --> 01:41:23,793
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

956
01:41:23,877 --> 01:41:26,463
That you're a good man.

957
01:41:26,546 --> 01:41:29,048
All evidence to the contrary.

958
01:41:29,132 --> 01:41:32,177
I have faith in you.

959
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:35,180
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

960
01:41:36,973 --> 01:41:39,976
Curiosity.

961
01:41:40,059 --> 01:41:43,021
You're going to want it.

962
01:41:43,104 --> 01:41:46,983
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

963
01:41:48,318 --> 01:41:50,487
You won't be able to resist.

964
01:41:51,863 --> 01:41:57,076
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

965
01:41:59,621 --> 01:42:02,624
I do want to know what it tastes like.

966
01:42:02,707 --> 01:42:04,501
But, seeing as you're a good man,

967
01:42:04,584 --> 01:42:09,005
I know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honour.

968
01:42:17,305 --> 01:42:19,432
I'm proud of you, Jack.

969
01:42:19,516 --> 01:42:22,352
Land, ho!

970
01:42:27,524 --> 01:42:29,359
I want my jar of dirt.

971
01:42:30,819 --> 01:42:33,738
- You're pulling too fast.
- You're pulling too slow.

972
01:42:33,822 --> 01:42:38,952
- We don't want the kraken to catch us.
- I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

973
01:42:39,035 --> 01:42:43,456
And I don't think it's "kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "krayken".

974
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,166
With a long <i>a?</i>

975
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:49,129
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken"
is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

976
01:42:49,212 --> 01:42:50,964
and "kracken" is closer to that.

977
01:42:51,047 --> 01:42:54,509
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

978
01:42:54,592 --> 01:42:57,303
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

979
01:43:01,182 --> 01:43:03,434
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

980
01:43:03,518 --> 01:43:05,854
Don't touch my dirt.

981
01:43:41,723 --> 01:43:46,936
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.

982
01:43:51,107 --> 01:43:54,444
Yes, it does. You're sitting on it.

983
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,030
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

984
01:44:04,746 --> 01:44:07,540
- "Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
- I could join the circus.

985
01:44:07,624 --> 01:44:09,250
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?

986
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:18,384
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

987
01:44:18,468 --> 01:44:20,470
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

988
01:44:20,553 --> 01:44:23,932
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

989
01:44:25,517 --> 01:44:28,520
- Down, then!
- Down!

990
01:45:38,214 --> 01:45:40,300
It's real.

991
01:45:41,259 --> 01:45:43,344
You actually were telling the truth.

992
01:45:43,428 --> 01:45:46,973
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

993
01:45:47,056 --> 01:45:49,934
With good reason!

994
01:45:50,018 --> 01:45:52,479
Will!

995
01:45:52,562 --> 01:45:56,357
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

996
01:46:02,405 --> 01:46:04,532
How did you get here?

997
01:46:04,616 --> 01:46:08,578
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

998
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:10,538
Not so easy, is it?

999
01:46:10,622 --> 01:46:13,249
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

1000
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:17,504
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

1001
01:46:17,587 --> 01:46:19,631
- What?
- What?

1002
01:46:20,215 --> 01:46:23,384
...I was reunited with my father.

1003
01:46:23,468 --> 01:46:25,678
Well, you're welcome, then.

1004
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:30,016
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

1005
01:46:30,099 --> 01:46:31,601
Pretty much.

1006
01:46:31,684 --> 01:46:34,062
Time and tide, love.

1007
01:46:34,145 --> 01:46:36,397
Oi! What are you doing?

1008
01:46:37,482 --> 01:46:39,859
I'm going to kill Jones.

1009
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:43,154
Can't let you do that, William.

1010
01:46:43,238 --> 01:46:49,285
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call
his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

1011
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:58,670
Now, if you please.

1012
01:46:59,337 --> 01:47:01,881
The key.

1013
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:06,761
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

1014
01:47:06,845 --> 01:47:10,181
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

1015
01:47:10,265 --> 01:47:13,893
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

1016
01:47:13,977 --> 01:47:17,605
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1017
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:22,402
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

1018
01:47:22,485 --> 01:47:25,613
I deliver it, I get my life back.

1019
01:47:27,198 --> 01:47:28,741
The dark side of ambition.

1020
01:47:28,825 --> 01:47:32,579
I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

1021
01:47:36,875 --> 01:47:38,418
Stop it!

1022
01:47:45,133 --> 01:47:46,634
Will!

1023
01:47:47,635 --> 01:47:50,763
- Guard the chest!
- No!

1024
01:47:50,847 --> 01:47:56,478
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...

1025
01:47:56,561 --> 01:48:01,357
Fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.

1026
01:48:01,441 --> 01:48:04,068
That will solve everything! I've had it!

1027
01:48:04,152 --> 01:48:09,115
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

1028
01:48:11,743 --> 01:48:16,915
- How'd this go all screwy?
- Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

1029
01:48:16,998 --> 01:48:20,168
Mr Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honour,

1030
01:48:20,251 --> 01:48:22,754
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

1031
01:48:22,837 --> 01:48:27,008
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

1032
01:48:27,091 --> 01:48:30,720
'twixt him and his twice-cursed
pirate father.

1033
01:48:30,804 --> 01:48:32,764
- Sad.
- This is madness!

1034
01:48:32,847 --> 01:48:36,643
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

1035
01:48:36,726 --> 01:48:38,645
Terrible temptation.

1036
01:48:38,728 --> 01:48:44,734
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

1037
01:48:50,406 --> 01:48:52,242
Enough!

1038
01:48:58,581 --> 01:49:01,167
The heat!

1039
01:49:20,228 --> 01:49:22,313
Bugger!

1040
01:49:34,450 --> 01:49:36,953
By your leave, Mr Turner.

1041
01:50:23,875 --> 01:50:26,961
By your leave, Mr Norrington.

1042
01:51:19,055 --> 01:51:22,058
Do excuse me
while I kill the man who ruined my life.

1043
01:51:22,142 --> 01:51:26,187
- Be my guest.
- Let us examine that claim for a moment.

1044
01:51:26,604 --> 01:51:32,068
Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

1045
01:51:32,152 --> 01:51:38,908
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

1046
01:51:40,076 --> 01:51:42,662
So whose fault is it, really,

1047
01:51:42,745 --> 01:51:47,125
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?

1048
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:49,210
Enough!

1049
01:51:51,463 --> 01:51:55,258
Unfortunately, Mr Turner, he's right!

1050
01:51:57,218 --> 01:51:59,137
Still rooting for you, mate.

1051
01:52:57,278 --> 01:53:00,114
We got it! We got it! We got it!

1052
01:53:14,462 --> 01:53:17,549
Hello, poppet.

1053
01:53:44,367 --> 01:53:46,286
Come on, run!

1054
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:31,080
- Sword!
- Sword! Sword!

1055
01:54:34,042 --> 01:54:36,586
Sword!

1056
01:55:17,293 --> 01:55:19,921
Follow my voice.
Follow my voice.

1057
01:55:20,004 --> 01:55:22,257
To the left... no, turn around.

1058
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:24,425
Go to the right.

1059
01:55:24,509 --> 01:55:27,011
No, that's a tree.

1060
01:55:27,095 --> 01:55:28,596
Shut it.

1061
01:56:18,146 --> 01:56:20,523
Jar of dirt!

1062
01:57:20,625 --> 01:57:22,627
Right.

1063
01:57:55,785 --> 01:57:58,079
We've got it!

1064
01:58:07,755 --> 01:58:10,800
Come on, Turner!

1065
01:58:26,941 --> 01:58:31,488
Leave him lie! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.

1066
01:58:31,905 --> 01:58:34,574
- We're not getting out of this.
- Not with the chest.

1067
01:58:34,657 --> 01:58:36,618
Into the boat.

1068
01:58:36,701 --> 01:58:39,662
- You're mad!
- Don't wait for me.

1069
01:58:45,835 --> 01:58:49,589
- I say we respect his final wish.
- Aye!

1070
01:58:58,973 --> 01:59:01,476
Your bravery is wasted.

1071
01:59:02,852 --> 01:59:09,192
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.

1072
01:59:11,069 --> 01:59:12,862
Here you go!

1073
01:59:24,624 --> 01:59:26,459
Pirates!

1074
01:59:44,519 --> 01:59:48,022
- What happened to the chest?
- Norrington took it to draw them off.

1075
01:59:48,439 --> 01:59:51,693
- You're pulling too hard!
- You ain't pulling hard enough!

1076
01:59:52,110 --> 01:59:55,155
- Where's the commodore?
- Fell behind.

1077
01:59:55,238 --> 01:59:57,407
My prayers be with him.

1078
01:59:57,490 --> 01:59:59,492
Best not wallow in our grief.

1079
01:59:59,576 --> 02:00:04,456
The bright side is you're back,
and made it off free and clear.

1080
02:00:19,804 --> 02:00:22,140
Lord on high, deliver us.

1081
02:00:25,393 --> 02:00:27,228
I'll handle this, mate.

1082
02:00:29,481 --> 02:00:31,149
Oi, fishface!

1083
02:00:32,609 --> 02:00:35,195
Lose something? Eh? <i>Scungilli!</i>

1084
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:42,452
Got it!

1085
02:00:43,661 --> 02:00:46,706
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

1086
02:00:46,790 --> 02:00:48,249
Look what I got.

1087
02:00:48,333 --> 02:00:51,419
<i>I got a Jar of dirt.</i>
<i>I got a Jar of dirt</i>

1088
02:00:51,503 --> 02:00:53,421
And guess what's inside it?

1089
02:00:54,339 --> 02:00:55,840
Enough!

1090
02:01:03,932 --> 02:01:06,684
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard!

1091
02:01:06,768 --> 02:01:09,938
Brace up the foreyard!

1092
02:01:13,066 --> 02:01:15,109
Hard to starboard!

1093
02:01:15,193 --> 02:01:20,114
Send his beloved <i>Pearl</i>
back to the depths.

1094
02:01:32,168 --> 02:01:36,047
She's on us! She's on us!

1095
02:01:37,632 --> 02:01:41,719
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, Captain.

1096
02:02:07,579 --> 02:02:09,122
Make fast!

1097
02:02:10,373 --> 02:02:12,917
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

1098
02:02:13,001 --> 02:02:15,753
Come on, girl!

1099
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:24,220
- She's falling behind!
- Aye. We've got her!

1100
02:02:24,304 --> 02:02:28,016
- We're the faster?
- Against the wind, the <i>Dutchman</i> beats us.

1101
02:02:28,099 --> 02:02:30,560
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

1102
02:02:30,643 --> 02:02:32,479
Aye.

1103
02:02:34,522 --> 02:02:36,065
We're out of range!

1104
02:02:36,149 --> 02:02:40,778
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

1105
02:02:40,862 --> 02:02:43,239
We're giving up, sir?

1106
02:02:53,333 --> 02:02:55,627
They're giving up!

1107
02:03:01,716 --> 02:03:03,843
My father is on that ship.

1108
02:03:03,927 --> 02:03:06,429
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.

1109
02:03:06,513 --> 02:03:13,478
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.

1110
02:03:23,571 --> 02:03:26,366
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

1111
02:03:27,742 --> 02:03:30,703
We must have hit a reef!

1112
02:03:32,789 --> 02:03:36,835
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!

1113
02:03:36,918 --> 02:03:39,963
- What is it?
- The kraken.

1114
02:03:40,338 --> 02:03:42,590
- To arms!
- Load guns! Defend the mast!

1115
02:03:42,674 --> 02:03:47,137
It'll attack the starboard. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!

1116
02:04:20,712 --> 02:04:23,173
Easy, boys!

1117
02:04:26,551 --> 02:04:27,594
Will?

1118
02:04:28,094 --> 02:04:30,305
Steady! Steady.

1119
02:04:32,265 --> 02:04:35,727
- Will!
- Hold. Hold.

1120
02:04:35,810 --> 02:04:38,813
I think we've held fire long enough.

1121
02:04:40,023 --> 02:04:42,400
- Will!
- Fire!

1122
02:05:02,504 --> 02:05:06,049
- It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
- There's no boats.

1123
02:05:14,265 --> 02:05:18,853
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

1124
02:05:21,189 --> 02:05:25,652
- Whatever you do, don't miss.
- As soon as you're clear.

1125
02:05:39,833 --> 02:05:43,962
We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!

1126
02:05:44,963 --> 02:05:47,090
Hurry up!

1127
02:05:47,173 --> 02:05:50,760
- There's only six kegs of powder!
- Then load the rum.

1128
02:05:59,644 --> 02:06:02,480
Aye, the rum too!

1129
02:06:30,675 --> 02:06:32,677
Step to!

1130
02:06:36,347 --> 02:06:38,933
You coward.

1131
02:06:43,771 --> 02:06:45,815
Not good.

1132
02:06:53,698 --> 02:06:56,409
- Haul away!
- Heave!

1133
02:06:56,493 --> 02:07:00,830
- Heave like you're being paid for it!
- Put your backs into it!

1134
02:07:43,915 --> 02:07:47,168
- I got you! I got you!
- Don't let me go!

1135
02:07:47,252 --> 02:07:49,921
- I won't let you go!
- Shoot me!

1136
02:07:55,218 --> 02:07:58,263
- Clear?
- Higher! Higher!

1137
02:08:15,113 --> 02:08:17,240
Here! Come on!

1138
02:08:17,907 --> 02:08:20,535
Come and get me. I'm over here!

1139
02:08:20,618 --> 02:08:22,704
Come on!

1140
02:08:47,645 --> 02:08:50,899
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

1141
02:10:18,194 --> 02:10:20,113
Did we kill it?

1142
02:10:20,196 --> 02:10:23,825
No. We just made it angry.

1143
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:27,162
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

1144
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:31,791
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

1145
02:10:34,043 --> 02:10:36,921
Jack. The <i>Pearl.</i>

1146
02:10:38,173 --> 02:10:40,550
She's only a ship, mate.

1147
02:10:40,633 --> 02:10:43,178
He's right.
We have to head for land.

1148
02:10:43,261 --> 02:10:46,347
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

1149
02:10:46,431 --> 02:10:51,060
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the <i>Pearl.</i>

1150
02:10:52,979 --> 02:10:54,814
Abandon ship.

1151
02:10:54,898 --> 02:10:57,317
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1152
02:11:14,042 --> 02:11:16,211
Thank you, Jack.

1153
02:11:18,296 --> 02:11:21,049
We're not free yet, love.

1154
02:11:21,132 --> 02:11:23,301
You came back.

1155
02:11:25,845 --> 02:11:28,556
I always knew you were a good man.

1156
02:11:41,528 --> 02:11:44,322
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

1157
02:11:44,405 --> 02:11:46,866
Come on, Will. Step to!

1158
02:12:05,969 --> 02:12:08,429
It's after you, not the ship.

1159
02:12:08,513 --> 02:12:11,432
It's not us.

1160
02:12:11,516 --> 02:12:14,310
This is the only way, don't you see?

1161
02:12:17,605 --> 02:12:19,774
I'm not sorry.

1162
02:12:25,321 --> 02:12:27,323
Pirate.

1163
02:12:46,718 --> 02:12:48,928
Where's Jack?

1164
02:12:52,515 --> 02:12:56,478
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

1165
02:13:05,153 --> 02:13:06,988
Go!

1166
02:13:19,751 --> 02:13:22,128
Bugger. Bugger, bugger.

1167
02:13:51,449 --> 02:13:53,576
Come on!

1168
02:13:57,831 --> 02:14:00,583
Just got it. Come on.

1169
02:14:29,654 --> 02:14:32,115
Not so bad.

1170
02:14:43,418 --> 02:14:45,253
Hello, beastie.

1171
02:15:34,093 --> 02:15:38,306
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

1172
02:15:39,641 --> 02:15:41,893
The captain goes down with his ship.

1173
02:15:41,976 --> 02:15:45,980
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

1174
02:15:51,277 --> 02:15:53,863
Open the chest.

1175
02:15:54,989 --> 02:15:57,534
Open the chest. I need to see it!

1176
02:16:13,133 --> 02:16:19,139
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

1177
02:16:24,936 --> 02:16:27,689
The last of our ships is returned.

1178
02:16:27,772 --> 02:16:30,191
Is there any news on the chest?

1179
02:16:30,275 --> 02:16:35,905
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

1180
02:16:35,989 --> 02:16:38,158
He had these.

1181
02:16:45,123 --> 02:16:48,293
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

1182
02:16:55,842 --> 02:16:59,929
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

1183
02:17:00,013 --> 02:17:02,640
Do you have the compass?

1184
02:17:02,724 --> 02:17:04,559
Better.

1185
02:17:11,733 --> 02:17:14,277
The heart of Davy Jones.

1186
02:18:09,707 --> 02:18:12,168
Against the cold

1187
02:18:12,252 --> 02:18:14,587
and the sorrow.

1188
02:18:24,848 --> 02:18:27,433
It's a shame.

1189
02:18:27,517 --> 02:18:29,978
I know you're thinking that with the <i>Pearl</i>

1190
02:18:30,061 --> 02:18:35,441
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1191
02:18:35,525 --> 02:18:38,278
Doesn't matter now.

1192
02:18:38,361 --> 02:18:40,947
The <i>Pearl</i> is gone,

1193
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:42,991
along with its captain.

1194
02:18:43,074 --> 02:18:45,285
Aye.

1195
02:18:45,368 --> 02:18:49,289
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

1196
02:18:49,372 --> 02:18:52,500
He fooled us all right till the end,

1197
02:18:52,584 --> 02:18:56,337
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

1198
02:18:59,215 --> 02:19:00,967
To Jack Sparrow.

1199
02:19:01,050 --> 02:19:06,055
- Never another like Captain Jack.
- He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1200
02:19:06,639 --> 02:19:08,725
He was a good man.

1201
02:19:29,412 --> 02:19:33,500
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1202
02:19:34,876 --> 02:19:38,588
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it?

1203
02:19:39,839 --> 02:19:42,175
What would you...

1204
02:19:45,637 --> 02:19:49,557
What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?

1205
02:19:50,725 --> 02:19:54,646
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

1206
02:19:54,729 --> 02:19:59,818
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious <i>Pearl?</i>

1207
02:20:05,949 --> 02:20:07,200
Aye.

1208
02:20:08,284 --> 02:20:09,619
Aye.

1209
02:20:10,245 --> 02:20:11,454
Aye.

1210
02:20:12,789 --> 02:20:13,832
Aye.

1211
02:20:16,835 --> 02:20:18,920
Yes.

1212
02:20:21,172 --> 02:20:22,423
Aye.

1213
02:20:22,507 --> 02:20:24,509
All right.

1214
02:20:25,552 --> 02:20:32,600
But if you go and brave the weird
and haunted shores at world's end,

1215
02:20:33,685 --> 02:20:39,983
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.

1216
02:20:54,873 --> 02:20:59,043
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?
