1
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:34,456
<i>As far as con man stories go,</i>
<i>I think I've heard them all.</i>

2
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:39,597
<i>Of grifters, ropers, faro-fixers,</i>
<i>tales drawn long and tall.</i>

3
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,340
<i>But if one bears a bookmark</i>
<i>in the confidence man's tome,</i>

4
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:49,374
<i>it would be that of Penelope,</i>
<i>and of the brothers Bloom.</i>

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,678
<i>At 10 and 13, Bloom and Stephen,</i>

6
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,743
<i>the younger and the old,</i>

7
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,619
<i>had been through several foster families.</i>

8
00:00:58,992 --> 00:00:59,981
No!

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,884
<i>Thirty-eight, all told.</i>

10
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,593
<i>Mischief moved them on in life,</i>

11
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,860
<i>and moving kept them close.</i>

12
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,835
<i>For Bloom had Stephen,</i>
<i>and Stephen, Bloom,</i>

13
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,031
<i>and both had more than most.</i>

14
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,700
<i>Another home, another Main Street.</i>

15
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,540
<i>Stephen looked around</i>
<i>and summed the burg up thusly.</i>

16
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,410
Bloom, we've hit a one-hat town.

17
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:26,942
<i>One theater. One car wash. One cafe.</i>
<i>One park. One cat,</i>

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,887
<i>which, through some mishap, had one leg.</i>

19
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,015
Sweet Jesus. Look at that.

20
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,217
<i>One public school,</i>

21
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,286
<i>one tight-knit group of local well-off kids.</i>

22
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,093
<i>Their pocket-change bought rocket pops.</i>

23
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,190
<i>The brothers...</i>

24
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,598
Pixy Stix.

25
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:47,531
<i>They were the they,</i>
<i>all well-loved, rooted, happy as you please,</i>

26
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,137
<i>always there in every town.</i>

27
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,075
Playground bourgeoisies.

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,996
<i>Could he simply...</i>

29
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,299
Talk to her!

30
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,734
<i>Just drop his fears and go?</i>

31
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,408
<i>Leave his brother in the woods,</i>
<i>and join the children?</i>

32
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,245
<i>No.</i>

33
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:36,447
<i>So, in the root of Stephen's psyche,</i>
<i>something now began.</i>

34
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:41,086
<i>A seed of grand epiphany. A hook. A tale.</i>

35
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,026
- A plan.
<i>- A fiction,</i>

36
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,293
<i>both for profit</i>
<i>and to ease his brother's heart.</i>

37
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,991
<i>A simple con in 15 steps.</i>

38
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,970
And this is where we start.

39
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,974
<i>And then, as if a curtain</i>
<i>had been pulled back from the sky,</i>

40
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,072
<i>some barrier</i>
<i>within the younger Bloom was broken.</i>

41
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,608
Hi.

42
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:12,351
<i>So Bloom performed his role</i>
<i>in Stephen's story to a T.</i>

43
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,361
<i>And being who he wasn't,</i>
<i>could be as he wished to be.</i>

44
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,573
So, the tale. You tell them...

45
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,083
There's a hermit in the woods.

46
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,121
A one-eyed, steel-toothed vagabond.

47
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,019
- With blood-red eyes?
- That's good.

48
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,320
He stopped you, coming home from school.

49
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,757
And told me of a cave.

50
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,089
What kind of cave?

51
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,096
A cave of wonder.

52
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,424
Shut up, Dave.

53
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,400
At noon on every Sunday,
there appears a ball of light,

54
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,664
which flutters, like a butterfly.

55
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,569
- A will-o'-wisp?
- That's right.

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,800
It guides you...

57
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,000
If you can keep up...

58
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,509
...to where the treasures lay.

59
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,568
- So where's this cave?
- Yeah, where?

60
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,576
The hermit didn't say.

61
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:14,086
He got this greedy,
glinting look, the filthy red-eyed leech,

62
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,850
and said he'd tell for 30 bucks.

63
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,490
Well, that's just 2 bucks each!

64
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,657
<i>And so that Sunday, straight from church,</i>

65
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,294
<i>into the woods Bloom led.</i>

66
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:40,142
<i>They stopped. Their hearts leapt.</i>
<i>There it was.</i>

67
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,571
Just like the hermit said.

68
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,701
<i>For just one moment,</i>
<i>Bloom forgot himself and ran too fast.</i>

69
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,737
<i>He'd catch the light and find the treasure,</i>

70
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,798
<i>but the moment passed.</i>

71
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:27,392
<i>They didn't catch the will-o'-wisp,</i>
<i>but didn't really care.</i>

72
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,754
It seems to me that in the end,
the perfect con

73
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,199
is where each one involved
gets just the thing they wanted.

74
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,027
Yeah, I guess so.

75
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,698
<i>Our fledgling thieves were satisfied.</i>

76
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,774
<i>The children's parents, less so.</i>

77
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,909
<i>A bitter ending? Maybe.</i>

78
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,112
<i>But there's sweetness in the mix.</i>

79
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,323
<i>The brothers Bloom had found their calling,</i>

80
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,360
<i>as shown in number six.</i>

81
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,718
<i>"Cut" meant to negotiate.</i>

82
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,060
<i>"Percent," percentage deal.</i>

83
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,533
<i>O'Henry's was the town's</i>
<i>one dry-clean shop.</i>

84
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,830
Pleasure doing business with you.

85
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,035
So how's it feel?

86
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,605
<i>In truth, young Bloom</i>
<i>won't know for 20 years just how he felt.</i>

87
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,310
<i>And so, we'll skip ahead now in our story.</i>

88
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,852
Let 'em melt.

89
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,734
He gets the scarab,

90
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,466
you get the money, and I get the girl.

91
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,804
So in the end,
everyone gets everything he wants.

92
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,508
Victor!

93
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:36,178
Charleston, what have you done?
Oh, my God.

94
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,082
Oh, God, he's dead!

95
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,084
He was the only one who knew
where our money was buried,

96
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:47,121
and you shot him! Charleston, you dunce!

97
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,162
The man named Charleston that you met

98
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,363
four months and 1,000 years ago

99
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,566
in a hotel bar in Jodhpur is dead.

100
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,138
If we see each other again,
it'll be as strangers.

101
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,807
As for the money,

102
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,080
let it rot.

103
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,683
Wow!

104
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,816
"Wow" is the word you're looking for! Wow!

105
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,756
You're a genius, Stephen.

106
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,728
We're genius, Bloom.

107
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,960
<i>Now, in defense of that shit-eating</i>
<i>grin on my older brother's face,</i>

108
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,731
<i>what he just pulled off was pretty amazing.</i>

109
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,739
<i>He hinged the entire con on this question.</i>

110
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,632
<i>Would Charleston, our spineless mark,</i>

111
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,302
<i>would he actually pull that trigger?</i>

112
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,048
<i>Maybe.</i>

113
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,674
<i>But Stephen wanted better odds.</i>

114
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,242
<i>He positioned me in the same spot where,</i>
<i>six years ago,</i>

115
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,880
<i>Charleston's wife had stood</i>
<i>and told him she was leaving.</i>

116
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,924
<i>He picked my suit to match her outfit.</i>

117
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,017
<i>He even phonetically matched</i>
<i>my final words to hers.</i>

118
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,289
This is the end, Charleston.

119
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,660
You've always been such a dunce.

120
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,030
So in the end,
everyone gets everything he wants.

121
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,535
Tastes like tinfoil.

122
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,073
So does real blood.

123
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,868
Buy you a drink?

124
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,772
Nine months and 1,000 years ago.

125
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,376
He was quoting from Kipling.
He stole that from Kipling.

126
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,354
No, he didn't.

127
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,322
So where's this wrap party?

128
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,723
Make way, make room
for the brothers Bloom!

129
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,593
Yeah, yeah!

130
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,534
All right, here we go.
Gather round, friends and accomplices.

131
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,572
Think of a card. You got it?

132
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,301
No.

133
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,674
If I do it enough,
someday it's gonna work on someone.

134
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,272
And then it'll be
the best damn card trick in the world.

135
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,144
It's true you never work
with the same crew twice?

136
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,119
Well, shit. Except for the...

137
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,212
Bang Bang?

138
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,883
You know, I'm pretty big into anime.

139
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,319
She's our fifth Beatle.

140
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,155
She knows the ins and outs.

141
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,657
I don't think she speaks
more than three words of English.

142
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,792
Campari.

143
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,769
So, she's with you and Bloom till the end?

144
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,703
Till the wind changes.

145
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,920
Where is Bloom?

146
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,373
There you are.

147
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,771
You hiding?

148
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,206
Yep.

149
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,249
I've been learning.

150
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,351
Stephen likes to talk about you.

151
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,386
He tell you the cave story?

152
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,987
Is it true?

153
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,117
What else did he tell you?

154
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,154
You two kicked around until your early teens

155
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,859
winding up in the grotty outskirts
of St. Petersburg,

156
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:47,598
where you learned the big con from an
old-school grifter named the Diamond Dog.

157
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,465
Is that true?

158
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,937
- That was his name?
- Yep.

159
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,672
And he was your mentor.

160
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,805
But I get the sense it ended badly.

161
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,311
Stephen took his eye out
with an antique rapier.

162
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,583
Why did he do that?

163
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,157
The brothers Bloom lit out on their own

164
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,760
to make their fortune as gentleman thieves.

165
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,089
Sounds romantic.

166
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,459
It does.

167
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,541
You don't understand what my brother does.

168
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,518
He writes his cons
the way dead Russians write novels,

169
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,215
with thematic arcs
and embedded symbolism and shit.

170
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,649
And he wrote me as the vulnerable antihero.

171
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,164
And that's why you think you wanna kiss me.

172
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,200
It's a con.

173
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,668
I'm going nuts.

174
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,045
There's the big two.

175
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,886
We missed the sunrise.

176
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,995
That would have been nice.

177
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,074
Is this the bathroom?

178
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,780
No. This is camels.

179
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,179
Hold on, I must make piss.

180
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,201
At least you're honest. All right, let's do this.

181
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,675
Let's just get it done. So, first you say,

182
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,838
"I'm quitting, Stephen. I'm out." Then I say...

183
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,973
- Do we have to go through this again?
- "Go through this again?"

184
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,109
And then you make a show
of putting on your jacket,

185
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,551
and you say, " No,
I mean it this time, Stephen.

186
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,486
"This time, I'm really out."

187
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,114
And then you say, "Let's have a drink,"

188
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,991
"and in the morning, Bloom,
you'll have come to your senses."

189
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,459
It's a major design
flaw in fake blood, by the way.

190
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,465
- "And we'll be moving on."
- Real blood turns brown...

191
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,898
- Listen to me, Stephen. I...
...after half an hour.

192
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,663
This Scotch cost more than your suit.

193
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,896
Listen to me.

194
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,197
The flask stopped a bullet in Normandy.

195
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,432
Listen!

196
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,676
Holy shit.

197
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,880
That's my new favorite camel.

198
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,890
I hate you. Okay?

199
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,931
Oh, God, I can't do this anymore.

200
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,937
I can't wake up next to another person
who thinks they know me.

201
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,536
And I'm 35 years old. I don't...

202
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,837
I'm useless. I'm crippled.

203
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,743
I don't...

204
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,972
I've only ever lived life
through these roles that aren't me,

205
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,381
that are written for me by you.

206
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,014
Tell me what you want.

207
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,921
Why? So you can write me a role
in a story where I get it?

208
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,255
You're not listening to me!

209
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:32,161
I want a real thing.

210
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,333
I want a...

211
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,731
I just... I want... I... want...

212
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,468
- You want an unwritten life.
- I want an unwritten life.

213
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,949
I'm going away,

214
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,211
somewhere where you and Bang Bang

215
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,411
won't even be able to track me down.

216
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,717
So don't try it, okay? No more stories.

217
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,623
I love you. Goodbye.

218
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,205
How'd you find me?

219
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,473
Bang Bang.

220
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,946
How'd she find me?

221
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,782
How you been?

222
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,785
Great.

223
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,197
I've been doing a lot of thinking
the past three months,

224
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,292
and I've come to the conclusion
that you don't want out.

225
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,860
You think you do, but you don't.

226
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,034
Hey, come here.
I wanna show you something.

227
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,804
I'm quit, Stephen.

228
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,240
Where are we going?

229
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,580
New Jersey.

230
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,884
Let me grab my coat.

231
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,892
So, where are we?

232
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,967
The largest private residence
on the Eastern Seaboard,

233
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,232
home of our final mark.

234
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,365
Daddy was an oil tycoon, a Hearst type,

235
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,809
built a Xanadu to match,
then died hunting quail.

236
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,305
Mom followed
into the hereafter two years ago,

237
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,909
after 10 years of fighting a disease
that I can't even pronounce.

238
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:12,048
Thank you. Leaving our sucker all alone
on this ludicrous estate

239
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,249
with an insane amount of very liquid assets.

240
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,625
What the hell is that?
What are we, near an airport? What is that?

241
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,788
Duck.

242
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,593
What the hell?

243
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,339
Get the car.

244
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,438
- Bloom.
- No women. One rule.

245
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,139
You know we don't do women.

246
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,242
And it's not a morality thing or a thing.

247
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,810
It's... Whatever it is,
it doesn't matter what it is,

248
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,882
it's just our rule. So what are we...
Is this a '78 Caddy?

249
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,221
Controversial choice.

250
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,890
So no, is what I'm saying, all right?
I'm quits, anyway.

251
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,297
I'll be in Montenegro, drinking.

252
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,667
Ah, Penelope Stamp, 33.

253
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,439
Lived at home her whole life.

254
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,145
An eccentric shut-in rich bitch?
You're not helping your case.

255
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,675
She's bored. She's a little seed in the snow.

256
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,416
We're going to put her on a grand adventure,
bring her to life.

257
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,287
She needs sprouting.

258
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,720
So this is the big plan, huh?

259
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:04,531
Lure me back in with some beautiful,
intriguing, elusive girl.

260
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,506
Seriously, Stephen. Amateur night.

261
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,682
I'm not saying yes, but what's the con?

262
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:28,021
It's actually pretty simple.
We're brothers, antiquities dealers.

263
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,220
We're traveling the world by steamer ship.

264
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,924
Bang! Give her
the old cackle-bladder and the brush-off.

265
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,133
And that's how it ends in Mexico,

266
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,693
burst of violence,
then a moment of truth on the beach.

267
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,769
What do you think?

268
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,671
You got something up your sleeve.

269
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:48,244
This is about me, right? Somehow.

270
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,779
Now, this might not be
something that you know,

271
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,184
but they've all been about you.

272
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,388
Maybe that's why they've none been perfect,

273
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:04,418
because I've never been
able to give you what you really wanted.

274
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,458
This isn't gonna give me what I want.

275
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,538
This will be the last one.

276
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,875
You'll let me go.

277
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,284
I'll never ask you to do another con again.

278
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,923
Make it a Schwinn.

279
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,568
There are less painful ways
to cut into a mark, you know.

280
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,570
Score to beat is 7.9.

281
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,481
Keep your head in the game.
The Japanese judge is very tough.

282
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,678
This is a banana seat, man!

283
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,949
Don't give me that blank look,

284
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,321
you know what a goddamn banana seat is.

285
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,620
Oh!

286
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,460
Shit.

287
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:26,836
Shit!

288
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,583
<i>There's actually a knack to this.</i>

289
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,683
<i>If you're trying to fast track</i>
<i>into a mark's sympathies,</i>

290
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,126
<i>there's nothing quite as effective</i>

291
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,528
<i>as having your first conversation</i>

292
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,965
<i>be from a hospital bed they put you in.</i>

293
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,246
What? Oh, come on.

294
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:59,664
I actually think this is kind of
a great thing, and I'll tell you why.

295
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,436
Dostoevsky was an epileptic.

296
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,003
His seizures were preceded
by an enlightened euphoria,

297
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,272
a sort of opening of his spiritual eye.

298
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:12,214
I think the fact that she saw your face
the instant before a seizure

299
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,050
is a pretty goddamn good foot
to start things off on, right?

300
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,918
<i>The next step,</i>

301
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:27,123
<i>is to figure out a way to insinuate yourself</i>
<i>into their personal life.</i>

302
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:34,135
I think they took my car.
Could you drive me home?

303
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,038
- Yeah.
- Okay.

304
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,574
I'm gonna...

305
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,530
<i>Step three, engagement.</i>

306
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,501
<i>Find a connection with your mark</i>
<i>through conversation.</i>

307
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,470
<i>Get invited in for coffee.</i>
<i>Tell them the full tale.</i>

308
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,006
<i>Set your hook.</i>

309
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,043
...didn't really have anyone
except each other growing up,

310
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,513
and our father was in the antique business.
He had a shop in Charleston.

311
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,017
We realized one day we saw the dealers

312
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,918
who were finding and selling us the antiques

313
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,890
coming from exotic countries,

314
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,927
around the world, and...

315
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,289
The air would, like,

316
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,991
before a rain, you know,
the ions would line up,

317
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,127
and you could just

318
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,468
smell midnight trains to Paris

319
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,772
and steamer ships
and Calcutta bazaars, and...

320
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,815
It could... Excuse me, I'm sorry, uh...

321
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,887
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

322
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,357
- Sorry.
- Okay. All right.

323
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,055
I'm really bad at talking to people.

324
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,688
That's okay.

325
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:11,858
You want me to go?

326
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,804
No. No, I really want to talk to you.

327
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,347
So...

328
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,520
What kind of stuff do you do?

329
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,591
Nothing. Maybe you should go.

330
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,232
All right, I'll just finish my...

331
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,962
I collect hobbies.

332
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,272
I see someone doing something I like,

333
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,897
and I get books and I learn how to do it.

334
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,031
Hmm.

335
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,003
Anything interesting?

336
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,213
Not really.

337
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,141
<i>Like he had a disease</i>
<i>He robbed another and another and a...</i>

338
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,273
- I really am not comfortable with this at all.
- I throw my right chainsaw...

339
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,840
- This is a running chainsaw.
...into the air and I will catch.

340
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,897
You just learn this stuff here by yourself?

341
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,534
Kind of sad?

342
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,796
No.

343
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,932
So, how do you plan to use all these skills?

344
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,501
I don't know. I'm not a planner.
I just do stuff.

345
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,182
Like, look at this watermelon.
It's a pinhole camera.

346
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:11,348
You can make a pinhole camera
out of anything hollow and dark.

347
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,621
It's gotta warp the image though, right?

348
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,555
Yeah, yeah it does.

349
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,391
I mean, that's what's good about it.

350
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,023
I mean, you could point this baby

351
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,226
at the most menial, everyday little thing,

352
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,328
like the fabric, or your...

353
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,170
Your face, or anything,

354
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,472
and depending on
how the pinhole eats the light,

355
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:38,414
it's gonna be warped and peculiar
and imperfect and odd,

356
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,919
and it's not gonna be reproduction,

357
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,978
it's storytelling.

358
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,549
It's a lie that tells the truth.

359
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,560
I don't know about truths.

360
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,327
A photograph is a secret about a secret.

361
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,763
The more it tells you, less you know.

362
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,228
What's changed between now
and 20 minutes ago?

363
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,672
'Cause this is sort of like a conversation.

364
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,403
Well, shit.

365
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,051
<i>Throw my ticket out the window</i>

366
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,967
<i>Throw my suitcase out there, too</i>

367
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,331
<i>Throw my troubles out the door</i>

368
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,204
<i>I don't need them anymore</i>

369
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,212
<i>'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you</i>

370
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,078
Well...

371
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,549
I should...

372
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,283
It's late.

373
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,582
- So...
- So...

374
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,557
I meet a lot of people in my job

375
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,858
I have to professionally act interested in.

376
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:04,361
It's a good feeling
to be genuinely interested in someone.

377
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,330
Are you leaving?

378
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,338
Yeah.

379
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,533
Oh.

380
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,310
Coming back?

381
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,839
Well, next time I'm in town.

382
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,545
We're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
off the docks,

383
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,848
to the continent for a few months.

384
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,946
Paris and Greece, I think.

385
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,923
I've got to get a hat.

386
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:33,163
Well, thanks for
the pinhole camera demonstration.

387
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,860
And the good conversation.

388
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,935
All right.

389
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,070
Goodbye, Penelope.

390
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,169
Goodbye, Bloom.

391
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,996
She isn't coming, man.
I need another day with her.

392
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,761
You'll have two weeks with her on the boat.

393
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,699
I need another day to get her on the boat.

394
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,464
She's not hooked. I've had one session,

395
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,201
and we mostly talked watermelons
and the optics of lensless photography.

396
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,937
It's not the talking that hooked her.

397
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,239
I think you're wrong.

398
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,840
Hey, get out of the street, idiot!

399
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,242
Watch it!

400
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,124
- Hey.
- Hi.

401
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,757
What are you doing here?

402
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,822
Uh...

403
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:50,367
I wanna give you this money
for the bike and for the whole thing.

404
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,604
- That's all right. It's not necessary, really.
- Oh.

405
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,713
Hey, where is this boat going?

406
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,343
Penelope, my brother Stephen.

407
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,572
Glad to make your acquaintance.

408
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,307
Bloom's told me so much about you.

409
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,941
You're the epileptic photographer?

410
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,348
Sort of.

411
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,950
And this is my personal assistant

412
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,716
and private masseuse, Mrs. Yueng Ling.

413
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,692
Yuengling like the beer?

414
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,260
No.

415
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,334
So, what are your plans in Greece?

416
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,529
- I don't plan.
- Good for you.

417
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:13,387
<i>When they begin the beguine</i>

418
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:19,987
<i>It brings back the sound of music so tender</i>

419
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,227
You look very nice.

420
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,033
<i>It brings back a night of tropical splendor</i>

421
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,799
<i>It brings back a memory of green</i>

422
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,409
What was your childhood like?

423
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,542
I made cameras out of watermelons.

424
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,616
Lonely?

425
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:54,127
When I was five, I got really bad rashes
and allergies and hay fever.

426
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,597
So my mom took me to the doctor,

427
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,602
and he did that test

428
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,071
where they use needles
to prick a grid on your back

429
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,571
with different toxins on them, you know,

430
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,873
to see which ones you're allergic to.

431
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,914
Next day I come in,
the doctor lifts up my shirt,

432
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,847
and my back is a patch of oily, moldy,

433
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,681
blackish-green double-puff marshmallows.

434
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,819
I was allergic to everything.

435
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,152
So they sealed the house with plastic

436
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,353
and a special ventilation system,

437
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,058
and I spent the rest of my childhood
and adolescence indoors.

438
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,565
Alone.

439
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:31,829
Lonely.

440
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,570
- Wow.
- It wasn't till I was 19

441
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,804
they discovered what I was
actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy

442
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,641
the hypodermic needles were made out of.

443
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,341
Then I was gonna leave,

444
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,979
but my mom got sick. So I stayed.

445
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,956
She stayed sick a really long time.

446
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,391
Do you...

447
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,819
Feel cheated?

448
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:04,198
The trick to not feeling cheated
is to learn how to cheat.

449
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,068
So,

450
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:10,439
I decided this wasn't a story
about a miserable girl

451
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,944
trapped in a house that
smelled like medical supplies,

452
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:18,908
wasting her life on a dying person
she sometimes hated. No.

453
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:25,614
This was a story about a girl who could find
infinite beauty in anything,

454
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,184
any little thing.

455
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:32,018
And even love the person
she was trapped with.

456
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,529
And I told myself this story
until it became true.

457
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:43,705
Now, did doing this help me
escape a wasted life,

458
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:48,108
or did it blind me
so I wouldn't want to escape it?

459
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,273
I don't know. But either way,

460
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,147
I was the one telling my own story, so...

461
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,711
No, I don't feel cheated at all.

462
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,668
I don't suppose in all your hobby-acquiring,

463
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,969
you ever learned how to dance?

464
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:21,404
I went through a phase when I was mildly
obsessed with the bolero.

465
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,503
Give me a minute.

466
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:05,920
It's a long time since I last encountered
the brothers Bloom.

467
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,956
Are you in antiques?

468
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,896
Antique?

469
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:21,495
I wonder, my dear, if you know
the true nature of the men you travel with.

470
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,841
A little fear might suit you, I think.

471
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,833
It isn't a Spanish band,
but they'll do their best.

472
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,543
Mmm...

473
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,871
And then... This is the really important part.

474
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,701
You have to make a little,
itty-bitty, little hole.

475
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,512
The ship's too small for us
to be dancing around each other.

476
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,076
We might as well have this out now.

477
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,955
Penelope, do you know our friend?

478
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,523
Only as the creepy Frenchman.

479
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,925
Book-learned. You know your languages

480
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,553
but not your accents, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

481
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,064
- No, I am Belgian.
- Ah.

482
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,162
Maximilian Melville, at your service.

483
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:35,899
Also known in certain professional circles
as The Curator.

484
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,703
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
What do you do?

485
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:43,770
I am a curator, presently at
the National <i>Musée</i> in Prague.

486
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,475
Yeah. And yourself?

487
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,210
I'm an epileptic photographer.

488
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,612
Good for you. And you boys?
What do you do?

489
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,453
We run a legitimate
antique reselling business.

490
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,514
Ah.

491
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,024
We've gone straight, Max.

492
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:05,626
<i>Pardon,</i> but why would you ascend to
the great heights of the brothers Bloom

493
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,399
just to toss it away, huh? To do what?

494
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,304
To sell terra cotta
to blue-haired weekend antiquers?

495
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,278
- I don't think so.
- We did. Eat your waffles.

496
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,481
You know, the <i>mademoiselle,</i>
she seems a little confused.

497
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,042
Maybe she is unawares?

498
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,644
Eat your waffles, fat man.

499
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,588
Unawares that the brothers Bloom, in fact,

500
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,861
are the two most respected

501
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,167
smugglers of antiques in the Western world.

502
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,795
Were. We've been on
the straight for three years. So that's that.

503
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:45,968
Oh, oh. Well, if that is that,
then that indeed is that. If you say so.

504
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,367
Oh.

505
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,482
- Your name's Melville.
<i>- Oui, vrai.</i>

506
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,511
Right.

507
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:59,386
No, sorry, um,
'cause I noticed before but I couldn't place it.

508
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,049
This ship is called the <i>Fidele,</i>

509
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:06,188
which is the name of the ship
in Melville's novel, <i>The Confidence-Man.</i>

510
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,428
- So that's weird.
<i>- Oui.</i>

511
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,700
I have never read that.

512
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:26,242
Smugglers. It's like an adventure story.

513
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,953
Whose idea was it to go straight?

514
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:33,688
Mine. Stephen always loved the life.

515
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:38,022
Then he was almost killed
on a run to Jakarta.

516
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,626
These two thugs
with heads like canned hams

517
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,530
worked him beyond all reason.

518
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,297
Have at me, you ham-headed bastard!

519
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,428
Shit!

520
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,006
Sometimes I think he'd love to die on a job.

521
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,409
Cornered at midnight on a run to Jakarta.

522
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,211
That's his dream,

523
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,549
to tell a story so well it fulfills itself.

524
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,482
Somehow.

525
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,987
It would finally make it real for him.

526
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,121
That's kind of the thing we all want.

527
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:19,993
Well, trying to get something real by telling
yourself stories is a trap.

528
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,868
Trust me on that one.

529
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,685
She's different. She knows...

530
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,284
Sometimes I feel like she knows everything.

531
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,528
Doesn't that worry you?

532
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,229
No, but something about her
is worrying you plenty.

533
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,895
She feels like one of your characters.

534
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,343
The day I con you is the day I die, Bloom.

535
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,083
How'd you get the Belgian on our budget?

536
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,285
He's beautiful, right?

537
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,387
I didn't expect him to actually be Belgian.

538
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,947
I'm not sure he is. I'm off to bed.

539
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:17,786
Hey.

540
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,997
The only real danger in this whole play

541
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,600
is that you actually fall in love with her.

542
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,295
Hey, look at me.

543
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,564
Mexico is closer than you think.

544
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,731
Don't fall in love with her, Bloom.

545
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,892
Good luck, boys, with the antiquing, huh.

546
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,444
My French is a little rusty,

547
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:12,107
but I believe he said,
"My proposition stands."

548
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,650
He came out of nowhere last night.

549
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,386
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> I will make you a proposition.

550
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,115
Oh, Lord. What has he got?

551
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,157
An 8th-century prayer book.

552
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,523
He steals pieces from his museum in Prague,

553
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,585
<i>and sells them off through smugglers.</i>

554
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,755
That's what he does.

555
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,161
I wonder who's his fence?

556
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,629
It's probably his Spanish guy, right?

557
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,689
Did he say who's buying?

558
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:34,226
Yeah, an Argentinean. Argentine? Argent...

559
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,602
A gentleman from the Argentine.

560
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:41,844
So, The Curator will sell it to a middleman
for $1 million US,

561
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:46,439
and then the Argentine...
The guy from South America,

562
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,281
he will pay $2.5.

563
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:52,478
It's not bad.

564
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,787
I'm sorry you had to deal with that guy.

565
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,551
Where's that cab going?

566
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,720
Train station.

567
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,423
Where's the train going?

568
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:03,659
Prague.

569
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:09,237
Come on! Let's be smugglers.

570
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,831
I mean, I think it'd be fun. We should do this.

571
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,809
- No.
- Why not?

572
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,169
Well, first off, we don't have $1 million.

573
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,976
That's like, I've got, what... That's whatever.

574
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,607
I mean, give me a real reason.

575
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,549
This is real. It's dangerous.

576
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,821
- This could go very bad.
- Hmm.

577
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,360
Well, I think
a little real danger might suit me,

578
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,055
so, if you three want to join
my smugglers gang,

579
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,655
I'II, you know, consider it.

580
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,399
This isn't an adventure story.

581
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:43,368
What are you talking about?

582
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,442
Well, it totally is!

583
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,115
Go, go, go. Go, go.

584
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,386
You there, come back here!

585
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,055
This is not for free.

586
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:16,763
Wait up. Where are you?

587
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,808
Come here. Come here.

588
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,540
We're smuggling.

589
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,913
From the snack car.

590
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,614
She's making a flag
for our smugglers gang, man.

591
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,750
This afternoon,
when she was writing in the observation car,

592
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,988
I thought she was writing a letter, a journal.

593
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,496
No. Come on, she's getting way too into this.

594
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,897
It's not funny. I don't like this Prague con
you've cooked up, either.

595
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:47,597
You're just leaving too much to chance.

596
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:48,831
Listen, the whole point of this

597
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,533
was to sweep her off her feet.

598
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,370
So why don't you let her enjoy it?

599
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,000
While it lasts?

600
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,813
This came through just now?

601
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,185
"Dear Stephen. Stop. Word on the wire is..."

602
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:12,023
<i>"...The brothers B.</i>
<i>are bound for Prague.</i>

603
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,585
<i>"I'm heading there myself.</i>

604
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,828
<i>"Would love to see my boys.</i>
<i>Affectionately, D. D."</i>

605
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:21,359
Our old Fagin is back. The Diamond Dog.

606
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,729
Wire him back for me.

607
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,536
Dear Dog. Stop.

608
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,737
Unless you feel an excess of eyeballs
left in your skull,

609
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:32,771
I highly suggest you stay far away from
me and my brother. Stop.

610
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,513
Affectionately... Et cetera.

611
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,863
You've taken this train before?

612
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:52,727
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

613
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,405
So this is all just like, "Whatever" to you.

614
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,805
Well, I mean, usually, I'd just, you know,

615
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,367
play cards and drink with Bang Bang
in the snack car.

616
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,742
Bang who?

617
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,506
Yueng Ling.

618
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,017
- Bang Bang's her smuggler nickname.
- Ah.

619
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,580
So how about me?

620
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,283
Do I get a smuggler nickname?

621
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,517
No.

622
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:24,060
I think you're constipated.

623
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,166
In your fucking soul.

624
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,907
I think

625
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:39,748
you might have a really big load of grumpy,
petrified poop up your soul's ass.

626
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,746
- What?
- Bloom, I know

627
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,352
I'm pretending to be a smuggler.

628
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,455
Right?

629
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,160
But what you don't know is,

630
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:56,162
I am a full-on smuggler.

631
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,000
'Cause I tell it like I own it.

632
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:05,667
You know what your problem is?
You just got to stop thinking so much.

633
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,838
I mean, just enjoy the ride, man.

634
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,675
I mean...

635
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,617
I love thunderstorms.

636
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,751
Oh, my God. I'm just so horny.

637
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,522
Goodnight.

638
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,805
Here's the big two.

639
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,219
Last time I was in Prague, I was in love.

640
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,084
What was she like?

641
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:30,888
Pale skin, long feet.

642
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:33,924
So...

643
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,494
And that's mine.

644
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,000
Bloom and I will secure lodging.

645
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:48,071
Miss Yueng Ling will scout out the museum.

646
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,077
You will go to the bank.

647
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,843
That wire should have cleared
if you put it in at Athens.

648
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,282
- Cash?
- No.

649
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,820
Only movie thugs and Russians
deal in suitcases of cash.

650
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,051
You're gonna get a certified check.

651
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,793
Who the hell is that?
Who is it?

652
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,763
A Candy-gram.

653
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,666
Max, it's us, for Christ's sake.

654
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:16,761
Whoa!

655
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,473
- Max! Max, it's us, Bloom.
- Max! It's Stephen and Bloom.

656
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,447
- Jesus, Max, easy...
- Jesus, whoa!

657
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:26,914
Whoa, now!

658
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,449
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good morning.

659
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,248
Come in. I have been drinking, you know.

660
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,448
So,

661
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,931
beside the basilica,
there are the offices of administration.

662
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:50,771
And underneath them,
and otherwise totally inaccessible,

663
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,309
there's a little section of catacombs.

664
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,243
And of course, the book.

665
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,680
But I am the curator, so I just walk in

666
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:02,115
and I pinch the copy girl's <i>babouche.</i>

667
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:05,688
I slip the book into my briefcase, and I leave.

668
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,584
About 2:00 tomorrow, say?

669
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,567
It is you who I do business with, <i>oui?</i>

670
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,137
Right.

671
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,134
Oh, right.

672
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,146
Your smile is the sun, <i>ma chère.</i>

673
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:38,718
And fallen men, we need the sun.

674
00:54:16,332 --> 00:54:20,098
Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a cane.

675
00:54:21,971 --> 00:54:23,404
Bloom.

676
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:27,207
Bloom, Bloom, Bloom.

677
00:54:30,179 --> 00:54:31,976
How long has it been?

678
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:34,071
Mmm?

679
00:54:34,584 --> 00:54:36,051
Tea.

680
00:54:37,053 --> 00:54:39,954
Can you believe it? Tea.

681
00:54:41,624 --> 00:54:43,091
Been a long time, huh?

682
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:45,184
If I call Stephen down here, he'll kill you.

683
00:54:45,261 --> 00:54:49,095
You're terrified, huh? Don't be scared.

684
00:54:49,866 --> 00:54:51,390
I'm an old man

685
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:55,929
with no depth perception.

686
00:54:56,005 --> 00:54:58,473
You don't have to be scared of me.

687
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:03,935
You know, it's been a funny thing,

688
00:55:04,013 --> 00:55:09,178
watching you boys take
what I taught you and eclipse me.

689
00:55:09,552 --> 00:55:11,349
I am so proud

690
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:16,688
to be a footnote
in the life of the brothers Bloom.

691
00:55:16,759 --> 00:55:17,919
But you

692
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:21,424
hate me.

693
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:30,302
You probably won't believe,
but I loved you both very much.

694
00:55:31,274 --> 00:55:33,003
But love...

695
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:38,176
You know, folks like us,

696
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:42,149
you can always
blink and realize that it's a fiction.

697
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:47,382
And like Peter walking on water
or Wile E. Coyote running off a cliff,

698
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:50,187
if you look down in doubt,

699
00:55:51,294 --> 00:55:53,285
you will fall.

700
00:55:55,398 --> 00:56:00,631
That's the price of our lives,
the wax in our wings.

701
00:56:02,104 --> 00:56:04,664
One day, Stephen's going to fall.

702
00:56:05,408 --> 00:56:09,310
It may be glorious,
but he's going to fall hard,

703
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:13,246
and he won't be there to tell you what to do,
to protect you.

704
00:56:13,483 --> 00:56:16,884
And without him, what would you do?

705
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,619
I remember all the other boys
when I went for the belt.

706
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:24,524
They would run. They would fight.
But not you.

707
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:28,155
You were so passive, paralyzed.

708
00:56:28,831 --> 00:56:33,825
This is a warning, Bloom, and an offer.

709
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,762
When he's gone,

710
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:38,603
remember me.

711
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,104
Oh!

712
00:56:45,181 --> 00:56:46,478
Stephen.

713
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:49,580
We were just talking about you.

714
00:56:52,755 --> 00:56:54,052
Fuck you!

715
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:28,682
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

716
00:57:29,325 --> 00:57:31,384
You can't always be there.

717
00:57:33,763 --> 00:57:35,628
Yeah, I guess I can't.

718
00:57:56,419 --> 00:57:57,579
Max!

719
00:58:02,592 --> 00:58:04,287
Aren't we a little early?

720
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:12,899
Well, he's gone, that's for sure.

721
00:58:13,636 --> 00:58:15,763
Probably halfway around the world by now.

722
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:18,033
Aren't you a wee bit early...

723
00:58:18,107 --> 00:58:20,132
I don't get it.

724
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:22,336
If he was hightailing it,
why didn't he just wait eight hours

725
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:24,709
until we traded the book for the million,

726
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:27,145
then he'd a had some walking-around money.

727
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:32,214
Oh, well, back to antiquing.

728
00:58:33,122 --> 00:58:34,817
Nothing lost, nothing gained.

729
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:35,879
Oh.

730
00:58:41,197 --> 00:58:42,858
"Oh?"

731
00:58:47,603 --> 00:58:50,094
The check was cashed yesterday afternoon.

732
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:53,403
He would have deposited it
in a Swiss account by now.

733
00:58:53,476 --> 00:58:55,603
I'm sorry, Pen. I'm sorry.

734
00:58:56,345 --> 00:58:57,812
Such a waste.

735
00:59:00,282 --> 00:59:04,150
Poor man. Poor Argentina man.

736
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:08,318
I mean, he's never gonna
even see that book now.

737
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:12,054
It's just gonna rot away in those catacombs.

738
00:59:15,598 --> 00:59:16,758
No.

739
00:59:16,832 --> 00:59:18,629
There is no book, all right.
We've been swindled.

740
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:21,101
Well, maybe there is. Maybe it's real.

741
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,537
- It's not real, it's a con.
- No.

742
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,971
You know what? It's my money,
so I'm going to find out for sure.

743
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:30,569
He gave us every piece
of information we need.

744
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:33,638
Well, we'd have to clear
the administrative offices.

745
00:59:33,716 --> 00:59:35,513
Some sort of...

746
00:59:40,189 --> 00:59:41,622
Disruption.

747
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:55,931
She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
It's kind of her thing.

748
00:59:56,005 --> 00:59:58,530
I feel like I want to know more about her.

749
00:59:58,607 --> 00:59:59,665
Yeah.

750
01:00:02,044 --> 01:00:06,276
<i>A few years back,</i>
<i>when we hit the top of our smuggling game,</i>

751
01:00:06,615 --> 01:00:08,446
<i>she just appeared.</i>

752
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:12,085
<i>And we figure someday she'll just disappear.</i>

753
01:00:12,421 --> 01:00:15,015
Check out the tat on the back of her neck.

754
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:17,958
It's an inky wisp of personal information.

755
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:19,960
Essentially, it means,

756
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:23,465
"When you're done with something,
blow it up."

757
01:00:33,943 --> 01:00:37,106
The smoke detector is in
these empty rooms in the east tower.

758
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:39,409
We're gonna plant and set off a tiny, tiny...

759
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,883
Tiny charge.

760
01:00:45,321 --> 01:00:48,757
A puff of smoke
sets off the fire alarm in the rafters.

761
01:00:48,824 --> 01:00:51,224
Fire drill ensues, offices empty.

762
01:00:51,293 --> 01:00:52,760
Excuse me.

763
01:00:52,962 --> 01:00:54,486
You have exactly four and a half minutes

764
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:57,396
to get through the access hatch,
into the catacombs,

765
01:00:57,466 --> 01:01:01,027
grab the book and get out
before the fire brigade arrives.

766
01:01:01,103 --> 01:01:05,062
The abort code, in case we have to abort,
is "corned beef."

767
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,802
For some reason.

768
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:10,402
Okay,
so she blows this one up.

769
01:01:10,479 --> 01:01:12,344
This is Yueng Ling's backpack?

770
01:01:12,414 --> 01:01:13,711
Yeah.

771
01:01:16,385 --> 01:01:18,148
You know what I feel?

772
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:20,788
Horny?

773
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:22,623
Scared.

774
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:26,390
And all my big talk, showing off all the time.

775
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:29,464
But, I mean, this isn't a story,

776
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:31,864
it's real.

777
01:01:33,536 --> 01:01:35,197
It's freaky scary.

778
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,840
Well, as long as you focus on,

779
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:43,242
you know, second left, third right.

780
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:33,745
Okay.

781
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:43,255
All right?

782
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:45,857
Okay.

783
01:03:55,945 --> 01:03:58,470
You know, for the record,
I'm still against this.

784
01:03:58,547 --> 01:03:59,878
Why send her in alone?

785
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:03,350
Because going in alone
is a very important thing to do.

786
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:09,321
Listen, she's walking into
a tourism office during a fire drill

787
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:13,452
and taking a phony manuscript
from a lousy crawlspace.

788
01:04:13,629 --> 01:04:16,962
Worst-case scenario,
a file clerk asks her if she's lost,

789
01:04:17,032 --> 01:04:19,125
which isn't even gonna happen.

790
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:24,806
Okay, she's in position.

791
01:04:27,643 --> 01:04:30,908
Because no one's gonna
even know we were ever here.

792
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,092
Fuck me.

793
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:01,642
Come on, don't do it. Don't, don't, don't...

794
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:18,954
Abort! Corned beef, corned beef!

795
01:07:04,099 --> 01:07:07,193
Wait, wait. We're fine. We're fine. She's fine.

796
01:07:07,669 --> 01:07:09,637
Listen,
if the soldiers find her wandering the halls

797
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:13,232
they'll assume she's a clerk.
They'll just shoo her out.

798
01:07:13,442 --> 01:07:17,276
So as long as she doesn't
do anything suspicious, she's fine.

799
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:31,118
Oh, no.

800
01:08:31,253 --> 01:08:32,720
It's the chief of police.

801
01:08:33,922 --> 01:08:35,787
The chief of police!

802
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:46,528
Thank you.

803
01:09:37,252 --> 01:09:39,243
I have, at different points in my life,

804
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:43,257
quite literally sold ice to an Eskimo
and sand to an Arab.

805
01:09:43,325 --> 01:09:46,158
But I have no idea
what she could have said to that man

806
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:49,197
to have sweet-talked her way
out of that castle.

807
01:09:49,264 --> 01:09:50,891
I could ask her.

808
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:52,763
How obtuse.

809
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:57,996
Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave until 8:00.

810
01:10:03,312 --> 01:10:04,802
That was real.

811
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,211
Yeah, I know.

812
01:10:08,183 --> 01:10:09,207
Huh...

813
01:10:09,284 --> 01:10:11,149
Freaky scary.

814
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:14,612
<i>Miles from nowhere</i>

815
01:10:15,157 --> 01:10:17,751

816
01:10:19,027 --> 01:10:21,154

817
01:10:22,664 --> 01:10:24,894

818
01:10:26,301 --> 01:10:29,031

819
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,599
<i>I have to climb</i>

820
01:10:33,675 --> 01:10:35,939

<i>To reach there</i>

830
01:11:13,081 --> 01:11:15,572
<i>I creep through the valleys</i>

831
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:18,385
<i>And I grope through the woods</i>

832

<i>'Cause I know when I find it, my honey</i>

833

<i>It's gonna make me feel good, yes</i>

834
01:11:27,596 --> 01:11:28,927
An apple.

835
01:11:30,365 --> 01:11:33,163
Yeah, it was part of an epiphany.

836
01:11:34,102 --> 01:11:36,366
<i>I love everything</i>

837
01:11:36,638 --> 01:11:39,402
<i>So don't it make you feel sad</i>

838
01:11:39,474 --> 01:11:42,375
<i>'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby</i>

01:11:48,683 --> 01:11:50,412

01:12:06,635 --> 01:12:08,762
<i>To reach there</i>

845
01:12:12,774 --> 01:12:14,264
Mexico.

846
01:12:17,245 --> 01:12:19,975
Okay, we're rendezvousing
with the Argentina guys here,

847
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:23,449
on a isolated beach
just south of the Hotel Tampico.

848
01:12:23,518 --> 01:12:24,815
A simple handoff.

849
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,445
Penelope, you and Yueng Ling
stay with the car,

850
01:12:27,522 --> 01:12:30,286
Bloom and I will be doing the handing.

851
01:12:30,358 --> 01:12:31,916
You guys seem a little tense.

852
01:12:32,661 --> 01:12:36,461
Well, I'm not thrilled they set this in Mexico.

853
01:12:37,232 --> 01:12:40,599
There could be legitimate reasons,
but Mexico's...

854
01:12:40,669 --> 01:12:43,467
And I don't like to simplistically vilify
an entire country,

855
01:12:43,538 --> 01:12:45,733
but Mexico's a horrible place.

856
01:12:48,043 --> 01:12:49,806
So we'll be careful.

857
01:13:06,495 --> 01:13:09,259
This is gonna be dangerous tomorrow, right?

858
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:11,231
Yeah.

859
01:13:13,468 --> 01:13:15,129
You should sleep at the hotel tonight.

860
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,965
I'll stay with Stephen at the beach house.

861
01:13:17,038 --> 01:13:18,903
But you'll need sleep.

862
01:13:21,243 --> 01:13:24,804
I'm really happy right now. Are you?

863
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:29,113
Right now I am.

864
01:13:29,784 --> 01:13:35,188
<i>I wanna be a smuggler</i>
<i>smuggle by day, drink by night</i>

865
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:37,652
<i>Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

866
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:05,214
The last box in our last con.

867
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:07,821
How's it feel?

868
01:14:30,445 --> 01:14:32,106
Hey, what's up?

869
01:14:38,253 --> 01:14:40,050
Bloom! What?

870
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:53,663
My brother and I are con men.

871
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,135
And...

872
01:14:58,773 --> 01:15:02,504
Everything since you hit me
with your Lamborghini,

873
01:15:03,578 --> 01:15:05,273
it's all fake, it's all

874
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:08,545
a con.

875
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:16,614
Stephen's gone into town
to prep the Argentina actors.

876
01:15:16,691 --> 01:15:17,749
Money's in his place.

877
01:15:17,826 --> 01:15:21,023
Money? I don't want the money, let's just go.

878
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:29,660
Come on, come on.

879
01:15:38,313 --> 01:15:40,804
You have to
switch it on at the base.

880
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:57,193
So, I told her our whole play.

881
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:01,563
And I'm here to take her money back.

882
01:16:03,204 --> 01:16:05,331
How does that make you feel?

883
01:16:07,275 --> 01:16:08,640
Disappointed.

884
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,507
This isn't the ending you wanted?

885
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:15,575
What does that matter?
This is the way it ends now.

886
01:16:16,551 --> 01:16:19,247
So I might as well just get it over with.

887
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,514
- Where's the money?
- I ate it.

888
01:16:20,588 --> 01:16:22,556
- Give me the money, Stephen.
- No.

889
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:23,886
I don't want the money.

890
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:26,119
He's not gonna keep a single piece of you.
Give me the money.

891
01:16:26,194 --> 01:16:29,391
I'm sorry you fell in love with her.
She's a mark.

892
01:16:29,564 --> 01:16:32,362
And all of this, all of it is just a con.

893
01:16:33,168 --> 01:16:34,499
And every moment you share with her,

894
01:16:34,569 --> 01:16:37,094
you're just playing the part
of a man falling in love.

895
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:39,766
That's what you're afraid of, isn't it?

896
01:16:40,508 --> 01:16:42,567
That you don't know the difference.

897
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:44,771
Or maybe that there really is no difference.

898
01:16:44,846 --> 01:16:46,780
That that's what love is, right?

899
01:16:46,848 --> 01:16:49,408
Okay, we're leaving.

900
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:50,982
No.

901
01:16:51,686 --> 01:16:53,779
You're too scared to leave.

902
01:16:54,022 --> 01:16:56,286
You're too scared to ride off into the sunset,

903
01:16:56,357 --> 01:16:58,257
because real sunsets might be beautiful

904
01:16:58,326 --> 01:17:00,988
but they turn into dark, uncertain nights.

905
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:05,829
No, you're not ready,
otherwise you wouldn't be here right now.

906
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:10,866
The money is in my bedroom.
It's right behind me.

907
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:15,035
But in my story you don't get the money
or the sunset or the girl.

908
01:17:18,046 --> 01:17:19,274
Bloom,

909
01:17:21,316 --> 01:17:22,874
let's just go.

910
01:17:24,385 --> 01:17:25,579
Please.

911
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,454
Please?

912
01:18:10,365 --> 01:18:12,162
Tastes like tinfoil.

913
01:18:26,848 --> 01:18:28,281
I'm sorry.

914
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,451
Shh. Shh. Shh.

915
01:18:39,194 --> 01:18:40,889
Get out of here.

916
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:44,461
Take the car and go.

917
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:48,167
I'm not going anywhere.

918
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:31,069
<i>The storm is passed</i>
<i>There is peace at last</i>

919
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:36,508
<i>I've spent my whole life sleeping</i>

920
01:20:37,512 --> 01:20:41,107
<i>Now there's not a sound</i>

921
01:20:41,182 --> 01:20:45,744
<i>No one to be found anywhere</i>

922
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:56,260
<i>A shepherd and a sheep</i>
<i>will wind you to sleep</i>

923
01:20:56,965 --> 01:21:02,335
<i>Where else on earth would you rather go?</i>

924
01:21:03,237 --> 01:21:08,641
<i>To a land of wonder when you go under</i>

925
01:21:09,577 --> 01:21:12,011
<i>Why would we want</i>

926
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:17,382
<i>to come back at all?</i>

927
01:21:45,046 --> 01:21:46,240
Hey.

928
01:21:48,349 --> 01:21:49,441
How'd you find me?

929
01:21:49,517 --> 01:21:50,541
Bang Bang.

930
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:52,210
How'd you find Bang Bang?

931
01:21:52,286 --> 01:21:55,813
She gave me her number
when we were in Mexico. Her cell.

932
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:57,621
Bang Bang has a cell phone?

933
01:21:57,692 --> 01:21:58,818
Yeah.

934
01:21:59,727 --> 01:22:03,629
I think she's kind of selective in
who she gives her number to.

935
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:11,797
Why are you here, Penelope?

936
01:22:14,609 --> 01:22:15,837
Okay.

937
01:22:18,513 --> 01:22:21,914
Well, I...

938
01:22:24,585 --> 01:22:26,485
I've had a lot of time, you know,

939
01:22:26,554 --> 01:22:28,385
to think, these past three months

940
01:22:28,456 --> 01:22:34,292
and I want you to seriously consider this.

941
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:53,010
Go away.

942
01:22:54,515 --> 01:22:55,880
Go away.

943
01:22:59,754 --> 01:23:01,813
Everything Stephen said was true.

944
01:23:01,956 --> 01:23:04,015
I was just playing you as a mark.

945
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,085
Okay? Everything between us,

946
01:23:10,565 --> 01:23:12,294
none of it was real.

947
01:23:14,235 --> 01:23:15,532
Okay.

948
01:23:28,583 --> 01:23:30,244
I don't believe you.

949
01:23:57,812 --> 01:24:01,373
<i>I let you do your monologue,</i>
<i>but you wanna know why?</i>

950
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:04,551
I let her believe everything you said,

951
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:06,883
so she'd never want to see me again.

952
01:24:07,722 --> 01:24:10,316
Get her away from all this for good.

953
01:24:30,511 --> 01:24:34,572
- You wanna tell me what I'm doing here?
- You knew she'd come back.

954
01:24:35,449 --> 01:24:38,907
What did you figure she was good for,
another million?

955
01:24:38,986 --> 01:24:40,817
$1.75 million.

956
01:24:44,692 --> 01:24:46,887
Look, of course she came back.

957
01:24:47,562 --> 01:24:49,757
She never got what she wanted.

958
01:24:51,365 --> 01:24:52,354
Neither did you.

959
01:24:52,433 --> 01:24:54,560
All right, look, we're gonna end this.

960
01:24:54,635 --> 01:24:56,569
You built us into this,
you're gonna fly us out,

961
01:24:56,637 --> 01:24:58,662
you're gonna end it, so she's done with this.

962
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:01,469
End it all so she can't start up again.

963
01:25:03,711 --> 01:25:06,179
Are you sure that's what you want?

964
01:25:07,582 --> 01:25:08,913
I love her.

965
01:25:12,987 --> 01:25:15,421
I don't want to turn her into me.

966
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,608
Well, we can't do the next job

967
01:25:43,684 --> 01:25:46,016
until we liquidate our assets
from the last job.

968
01:25:46,087 --> 01:25:48,214
Uh-uh, you've got my million
from the last job, so...

969
01:25:48,289 --> 01:25:51,486
That's profit, not capital,
the three of us already split that up.

970
01:25:51,559 --> 01:25:55,655
So, step number one
is to sell the book of hours.

971
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,095
Ah.

972
01:25:57,698 --> 01:26:01,156
The one that you told me was fake, right?

973
01:26:01,235 --> 01:26:03,533
Actually, with all your random expertise,

974
01:26:03,604 --> 01:26:05,834
we couldn't risk a flat-out fake.

975
01:26:06,407 --> 01:26:10,400
But to get top dollar,
we'll have to sell it deep black market.

976
01:26:11,345 --> 01:26:14,837
And there's only one place
that's deep enough for that.

977
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:16,780
Where?

978
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:27,253
- Who'd you get, anyway?
- Hmm?

979
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,193
To play the Russians.

980
01:26:35,369 --> 01:26:36,927
My boys.

981
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:41,406
I don't understand.

982
01:26:41,475 --> 01:26:45,138
We're sending Penelope off into the sunset,
that's what we're doing.

983
01:26:45,212 --> 01:26:46,338
Why is he here?

984
01:26:46,414 --> 01:26:50,043
We need someone to pass
for the Russian mob to sell our fake book to.

985
01:26:50,117 --> 01:26:51,982
The Dog has his big store right here
in Saint Petersburg.

986
01:26:52,053 --> 01:26:53,748
All right, stop.

987
01:26:54,388 --> 01:26:56,015
I hate him, Stephen.

988
01:26:56,657 --> 01:26:58,887
But this isn't that.

989
01:26:58,959 --> 01:27:00,119
This is I don't trust him.

990
01:27:00,194 --> 01:27:02,162
Yeah, what's he gonna do?

991
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:04,720
Steal our fake money?

992
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:06,733
I have thought this through, believe me.

993
01:27:06,801 --> 01:27:09,099
And we can't end it without him.

994
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:15,572
Trust me. It's gonna be okay.

995
01:27:21,582 --> 01:27:24,813
Stephen,
still the grand architect.

996
01:27:24,885 --> 01:27:30,755
Your symbols, red for temptation,
white for salvation.

997
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:35,561
And our hero must face the Minotaur
before he escapes the maze.

998
01:27:35,629 --> 01:27:36,618
Uh-huh.

999
01:27:37,031 --> 01:27:38,965
Pickup will be at your store.

1000
01:27:39,033 --> 01:27:41,968
Scare her,
think a movie version of the Russian mob,

1001
01:27:42,036 --> 01:27:44,129
but don't hassle the girl.

1002
01:27:44,205 --> 01:27:46,799
The girl? What's her name?

1003
01:27:46,874 --> 01:27:48,865
You don't need to know her name.

1004
01:27:51,011 --> 01:27:53,206
I know it. Penelope.

1005
01:27:54,181 --> 01:27:56,513
I look forward to meeting the lady.

1006
01:27:57,818 --> 01:27:59,217
All right, here we go.

1007
01:27:59,286 --> 01:28:01,880
We got the back windshield wired to explode,

1008
01:28:01,956 --> 01:28:04,823
and there's a large charge
underneath the hood.

1009
01:28:04,892 --> 01:28:08,259
After the handoff with the Dog,
we drive out of town.

1010
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:10,422
Late that night, we stop at a gas station

1011
01:28:10,498 --> 01:28:12,796
where our fake Russians double-cross us,

1012
01:28:12,933 --> 01:28:15,231
and kill us all in a moonlight ambush.

1013
01:28:15,302 --> 01:28:19,329
We all die. Bloom takes a bullet
so Penelope can escape.

1014
01:28:20,474 --> 01:28:21,736
The end.

1015
01:28:23,411 --> 01:28:24,537
Okay.

1016
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,275
You've been awfully quiet.

1017
01:28:37,124 --> 01:28:39,558
I'm doing this for her, you know.

1018
01:28:52,606 --> 01:28:54,574
Tomorrow is the big day.

1019
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:33,603
Get down!

1020
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:49,589
- Out!
- Come on, come on.

1021
01:30:49,957 --> 01:30:51,686
Get out, get out.

1022
01:31:02,836 --> 01:31:05,168
Bloom! Bloom.

1023
01:31:09,543 --> 01:31:10,635
What happened?

1024
01:31:10,711 --> 01:31:11,735
You okay?

1025
01:31:13,314 --> 01:31:15,748
What happened? Where's Stephen?

1026
01:31:16,684 --> 01:31:18,276
Stephen?

1027
01:31:18,519 --> 01:31:19,850
I think...

1028
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,411
Bloom, I think they might have got him,

1029
01:31:22,489 --> 01:31:25,458
because I think they double-crossed us
or something,

1030
01:31:25,526 --> 01:31:29,257
because, you know,
I think they got Stephen, but...

1031
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:30,888
- Stephen's notebook.
- They're gonna want money

1032
01:31:30,965 --> 01:31:33,126
so then we can get him back.

1033
01:31:34,501 --> 01:31:36,025
Who's got him?

1034
01:31:36,704 --> 01:31:39,537
Why, I think the Russians got him, Bloom.

1035
01:31:48,983 --> 01:31:51,679
Stephen, God, please, what's happening?

1036
01:31:52,386 --> 01:31:54,752
I don't know what to do, Stephen.

1037
01:32:01,195 --> 01:32:02,526
Shit!

1038
01:32:10,337 --> 01:32:14,831
If you know what's happening,
now would be a really good time to speak up.

1039
01:32:24,151 --> 01:32:28,520
Oh, please. Please, not now.
I need your help here.

1040
01:32:28,589 --> 01:32:30,750
I don't know what to do.

1041
01:32:57,284 --> 01:32:58,512
Thanks.

1042
01:33:17,571 --> 01:33:18,833
I can't believe it.

1043
01:33:18,906 --> 01:33:21,670
What, that Bang Bang fell for a car bomb?

1044
01:33:22,142 --> 01:33:23,666
Neither can I.

1045
01:33:24,778 --> 01:33:26,245
Oh, you mean...

1046
01:33:27,247 --> 01:33:29,579
You think maybe she faked it

1047
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:32,414
to make the Russians think she was dead?

1048
01:33:33,587 --> 01:33:36,715
Bloom, what do we do now?

1049
01:33:43,664 --> 01:33:45,256
It's a ransom note.

1050
01:33:45,332 --> 01:33:46,890
It says they have Stephen.

1051
01:33:46,967 --> 01:33:50,562
It says they want the money
wired to a specific account.

1052
01:33:50,637 --> 01:33:53,902
They give a bank to do it at,
a manager to ask for.

1053
01:33:54,241 --> 01:33:56,971
Then an address to go to
at 2:00 p.m., in two hours.

1054
01:33:57,044 --> 01:33:58,375
Okay.

1055
01:33:58,445 --> 01:34:02,609
Well, I'll wire the money from my account,
and we'll go get Stephen.

1056
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:04,317
It's a lot.

1057
01:34:04,685 --> 01:34:06,243
I'll do it. I want to. I've got...

1058
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,617
Well, how much are they asking for?

1059
01:34:07,688 --> 01:34:09,451
$1.75 million.

1060
01:34:10,357 --> 01:34:11,346
Oh.

1061
01:34:16,463 --> 01:34:17,452
Oh...

1062
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:29,969
No! I'm gonna kill him.
I am gonna kill him if that's what this is.

1063
01:34:30,043 --> 01:34:32,341
If that's all that this is, I will kill him.

1064
01:34:32,412 --> 01:34:34,141
Kill who? What are you talking about?

1065
01:34:34,281 --> 01:34:36,044
I will kill him. I will... No!

1066
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:37,778
What?

1067
01:34:41,088 --> 01:34:45,525
I've been an idiot. This could all be a con
by my brother to get me to...

1068
01:34:46,827 --> 01:34:50,695
Oh, God, he wanted me to end it,
and he gets your money.

1069
01:34:50,764 --> 01:34:52,391
Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

1070
01:34:52,466 --> 01:34:55,367
But would he do that? To you?

1071
01:34:57,237 --> 01:34:58,932
I don't know.

1072
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:02,740
Yes. Yeah, of course he would.

1073
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:05,840
To tell a story so well it becomes real.

1074
01:35:06,413 --> 01:35:09,109
The perfect con. That's his whole...

1075
01:35:10,818 --> 01:35:12,342
God damn it, that's what.

1076
01:35:12,419 --> 01:35:14,182
You know what? We don't know.

1077
01:35:15,489 --> 01:35:17,548
- We better transfer the money.
- Son of a...

1078
01:35:17,624 --> 01:35:19,615
It's your brother's life.

1079
01:35:21,128 --> 01:35:23,119
I'm gonna wire the money.

1080
01:35:30,904 --> 01:35:32,030
Okay.

1081
01:35:39,546 --> 01:35:41,878
I'm coming in with you.

1082
01:35:42,316 --> 01:35:43,806
No, stay here.

1083
01:35:45,586 --> 01:35:48,646
Going in alone is a very
important thing to do.

1084
01:35:53,427 --> 01:35:55,019
I'm so scared.

1085
01:35:58,599 --> 01:36:02,091
Anything I can imagine
finding in there, I'm scared of.

1086
01:36:04,104 --> 01:36:06,572
I'm gonna be here when you come out.

1087
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:45,075
Stephen?

1088
01:36:51,785 --> 01:36:53,275
Stephen?

1089
01:36:57,090 --> 01:36:59,456
Game's up. Come on out.

1090
01:37:03,263 --> 01:37:05,925
Come on, let's blow this one-hat town.

1091
01:37:41,835 --> 01:37:43,769
- Stephen!
- No, Bloom.

1092
01:37:48,542 --> 01:37:50,134
Did Penelope wire the money?

1093
01:37:50,644 --> 01:37:51,838
Yeah.

1094
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:59,014
Stephen, tell me what this is.

1095
01:37:59,086 --> 01:38:01,418
Jesus Christ, Bloom, I'm sorry.

1096
01:38:01,488 --> 01:38:04,150
I don't need sorry. I need the truth.

1097
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:09,185
God damn it, Stephen.
You tell me what to do.

1098
01:38:09,262 --> 01:38:10,991
- Get the hell out of here now!
- Tell me the truth.

1099
01:38:11,064 --> 01:38:13,328
Is this a con or is it real?

1100
01:38:15,268 --> 01:38:16,860
A con?

1101
01:38:18,972 --> 01:38:20,599
It's real, Bloom.

1102
01:38:24,478 --> 01:38:26,139
<i>Hello, Bloom.</i>

1103
01:38:26,213 --> 01:38:28,181
God damn it, Bloom.
It's real, this is not a con.

1104
01:38:28,248 --> 01:38:31,581
<i>Are you happy to hear</i>
<i>from your old Diamond Dog?</i>

1105
01:38:31,651 --> 01:38:35,280
These are the Dog's men.
He's crossed us for revenge.

1106
01:38:35,589 --> 01:38:36,988
Damn it, Bloom, run!

1107
01:38:37,057 --> 01:38:39,787
<i>I told you Stephen would fall.</i>

1108
01:38:40,994 --> 01:38:44,054
<i>And you? You are paralyzed,</i>

1109
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:48,691
<i>praying this is just</i>
<i>another one of Stephen's stories.</i>

1110
01:38:49,236 --> 01:38:50,703
<i>Is it?</i>

1111
01:38:51,338 --> 01:38:54,398
<i>Close your eyes now, sweet child.</i>

1112
01:38:55,442 --> 01:38:58,639
<i>And I will tell you the truth.</i>

1113
01:39:02,315 --> 01:39:03,373
No!

1114
01:39:15,462 --> 01:39:16,724
Bloom!

1115
01:39:23,236 --> 01:39:24,999
He's got another gun!

1116
01:39:51,731 --> 01:39:53,961
Please tell me that's makeup.

1117
01:39:54,468 --> 01:39:56,060
Please tell me that's a cackle-bladder,

1118
01:39:56,136 --> 01:39:57,694
and you just pulled off the perfect con.

1119
01:39:57,771 --> 01:39:59,136
Please.

1120
01:40:25,765 --> 01:40:27,699
You said it, not me.

1121
01:40:31,438 --> 01:40:33,497
Can I get a "wow" for this?

1122
01:40:36,143 --> 01:40:37,269
Wow.

1123
01:40:39,779 --> 01:40:42,247
You son of a bitch.

1124
01:40:52,959 --> 01:40:55,052
You did it. You're done here.

1125
01:40:55,128 --> 01:40:59,462
I want you to promise me you'll never
come back to St. Petersburg again.

1126
01:41:08,008 --> 01:41:09,771
Tastes like tinfoil.

1127
01:41:10,644 --> 01:41:14,205
All right, here's what I want you to do.
Bang Bang split?

1128
01:41:14,581 --> 01:41:16,071
Yeah. Clean exit.

1129
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:17,173
How?

1130
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:18,681
Car bomb.

1131
01:41:18,752 --> 01:41:19,844
Good.

1132
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:22,111
- Penelope?
- She's outside.

1133
01:41:22,189 --> 01:41:23,781
All right, here's what.

1134
01:41:24,858 --> 01:41:27,986
<i>Take Penelope to Helsinki,</i>
<i>get that flight to Rio.</i>

1135
01:41:28,061 --> 01:41:30,552
<i>Play out the whole</i>
<i>"on the run from vengeful Russians" thing,</i>

1136
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:33,155
<i>that'll be fun for her.</i>
<i>Play it like I'm dead, actually.</i>

1137
01:41:33,233 --> 01:41:35,326
That'll add some gravity to everything.

1138
01:41:35,402 --> 01:41:37,529
And I'll see you when I see you.

1139
01:41:38,572 --> 01:41:41,268
- When?
- I don't know. Not too soon, I hope.

1140
01:41:41,341 --> 01:41:44,003
Last thing you need is me hanging around.

1141
01:41:44,077 --> 01:41:46,739
Anyway, how am I going to top this?

1142
01:41:47,113 --> 01:41:48,375
Bloom,

1143
01:41:49,783 --> 01:41:51,216
pick a card.

1144
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:55,379
- All right.
- Got it?

1145
01:41:55,889 --> 01:41:57,220
Yeah.

1146
01:42:04,998 --> 01:42:07,899
That's the best card trick I've ever seen.

1147
01:42:09,836 --> 01:42:12,202
Wish you had a bigger audience.

1148
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,369
You're the only audience I ever needed.

1149
01:42:26,753 --> 01:42:28,118
I love you.

1150
01:42:31,157 --> 01:42:32,283
Bye.

1151
01:42:40,634 --> 01:42:41,862
Shh. Shh. Shh.

1152
01:42:41,935 --> 01:42:44,130
It's okay. It's okay.

1153
01:45:04,244 --> 01:45:07,270
You know, he said this thing to me once.

1154
01:45:09,916 --> 01:45:12,180
He said to me,

1155
01:45:12,252 --> 01:45:15,949
"There's no such thing as an unwritten life.

1156
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:20,752
"Just a badly written one."

1157
01:45:26,699 --> 01:45:28,132
Oh, God.

1158
01:45:31,337 --> 01:45:33,134
I love you, Bloom.

1159
01:45:38,678 --> 01:45:40,942
You know what we're gonna do?

1160
01:45:45,985 --> 01:45:48,180
We're gonna live

1161
01:45:49,422 --> 01:45:52,880
like we're telling the best story
in the whole world.

1162
01:45:58,398 --> 01:46:00,127
Are you ready?

1163
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:12,938
<i>And Stephen said</i>
<i>something else, once.</i>

1164
01:46:14,113 --> 01:46:16,604
<i>"The perfect con is one</i>
<i>where everyone involved</i>

1165
01:46:16,683 --> 01:46:19,174
<i>"gets just the thing they wanted."</i>

1166
01:46:26,226 --> 01:46:27,557
<i>Well...</i>

1167
01:50:22,428 --> 01:50:24,555
<i>You came to me</i>

1168
01:50:25,064 --> 01:50:30,001
<i>In the hospital ward when I blew out my knee</i>

1169
01:50:31,137 --> 01:50:35,597
<i>But I wasn't there to be cared for or carried</i>

1170
01:50:39,879 --> 01:50:42,780
<i>'Cause I was asleep</i>

1171
01:50:42,849 --> 01:50:47,877
<i>In my bed, in my house</i>
<i>at the end of our street</i>

1172
01:50:49,021 --> 01:50:53,549
<i>While you drove across town</i>
<i>at 3:00 in the morning</i>

1173
01:50:56,362 --> 01:50:59,923
<i>It was fake</i>

1174
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,197
<i>For the sake</i>

1175
01:51:05,805 --> 01:51:09,366
<i>Of making you take me for real</i>

1176
01:51:09,776 --> 01:51:16,443
<i>But I guess you're even less impressed</i>

1177
01:51:24,123 --> 01:51:27,058
<i>If the world is a stage</i>

1178
01:51:27,593 --> 01:51:32,758
<i>And we're all of us actors</i>
<i>in some cosmic play</i>

1179
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:38,894
<i>I am the man at the masquerade</i>

1180
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:44,237
<i>Who was fake</i>

1181
01:51:45,711 --> 01:51:49,807
<i>For the sake</i>

1182
01:51:50,716 --> 01:51:54,208
<i>Of making you take me for real</i>

1183
01:51:54,754 --> 01:52:01,091
<i>But I guess you're even less impressed</i>

1184
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:07,827
<i>I keep trying to paint a picture</i>

1185
01:52:09,836 --> 01:52:12,361
<i>'Cause what I drew</i>

1186
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:17,266
<i>Could be improved</i>

1187
01:52:17,343 --> 01:52:20,870
<i>If I could make you see</i>

1188
01:52:21,314 --> 01:52:26,616
<i>More flame than flicker</i>

1189
01:52:27,086 --> 01:52:30,419
<i>These half-truths</i>

1190
01:52:32,391 --> 01:52:36,657
<i>Could be improved</i>

1191
01:52:36,729 --> 01:52:40,961
<i>With less of me</i>

1192
01:52:44,503 --> 01:52:47,438
<i>And more you</i>

1193
01:52:52,912 --> 01:52:55,972
<i>Believe what I speak</i>

1194
01:53:04,257 --> 01:53:08,250
<i>At least just keep</i>

1195
01:53:15,801 --> 01:53:19,259
<i>Speaking to me</i>
