02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,328
GLASS: That's his horse, all right.

1153
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:49,700
No way he could've ridden him
through the night.

1154
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,529
HENRY: How far ahead?

1155
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:54,122
Half a day at the most.

1156
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:56,204
Could be Ree.

1157
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,607
If they aren't his, we lose him.

1158
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:02,966
Unless he reenlisted so he
could justify killing again...

1159
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,260
these tracks right here are his.

(GLASS URGING HORSE)

1161
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:18,120
HENRY: I can't remember my wife's face.

1162
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,486
Last week, she was still with me.

1163
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:24,804
Now she's gone.

1164
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:31,168
I worry I won't recognize her
when I get back home.

1165
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:45,641
Is it true you killed an officer?

1166
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:53,688
I just killed the man
who was trying to kill my son.

(SNIFFING)

1168

Smoke.

1169
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,451
How close?

1170
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:23,361
No more than a mile up that way.

1171
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:26,888
I'm gonna head up to the west.
You go down to the east.

1172
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,601
Let's see if we can find some tracks.

1173
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,289
And if it's the Ree?

1174
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:37,123
If it's the Ree, you turn right back around
and meet me back here. (URGES HORSE)

(GLASS'S WIFE SPEAKING PAWNEE)

1176
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:07,804
Now, I wouldn't expect to find
a man of your stature...

1177
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:11,380
so far away from his stove
on a morning as cold as this, Captain.

1178
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:12,811
You lost?

1179
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,486
I'm here to take you back to Fort Kiowa...

1180
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,962
where you will be tried for murder.

1181
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:19,651
Is that so?

1182
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:22,167
I ain't crazy about your plan.

1183
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:24,642
Besides, I got one of my own.

I tried to tell your boy, all right?

1197
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:04,420
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't listen

1198
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:06,180
and he kept on screaming.

1199
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:08,806
He was gonna get everybody killed.

1200

But you and me... we had a deal.

what happened out there.

1204

There was no deal.

1205
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:32,369
You killed my boy.

1206
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:42,289
Well, maybe you should've raised a man,
instead of some girlie little bitch.
