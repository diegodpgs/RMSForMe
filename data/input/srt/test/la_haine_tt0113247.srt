1
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,234
You murderers! It's easy
to gun us down! We only got rocks!

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,234
H A T E

3
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,388
This film is dedicated
to friends and family

4
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,710
who died
while it was in the making.

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,676
Heard about the guy
who fell off a skyscraper?

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,630
On his way down past each floor,

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,109
he kept saying
to reassure himself:

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,911
"So far so good...

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,471
"so far so good..."

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,796
How you fall doesn't matter.

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,879
It's how you land!

12
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,597
More rioting in the projects
outside the city.

13
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,671
Last night a mob of youths

14
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,911
attacked a police station

15
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,112
in the Muguet projects.

16
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,158
Pitched battles
left 14 officers injured.

17
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,038
33 arrests were made.

18
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,749
A mall and nearby buildings
were damaged by looters

19
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,151
who dispersed around 4 a.m.

20
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,108
Alleged police brutality
sparked the riots 2 days ago.

21
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,909
A local teen was severely beaten
under questioning.

22
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,593
The officer was suspended.

23
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,629
The victim, Abdel Ichaha,
is in hospital

24
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,472
in critical condition.

25
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,870
Got a looter under arrest,
a minor.

26
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,113
SAYlD: FUCK THE POLlCE

27
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,958
Vinz! Where the fuck is he?

28
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,351
- What?
- Whadda ya mean "what"?

29
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,272
Can't fuckin' say hello?

30
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,271
Chill, Sayid. What's up?

31
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,271
Tell your bro to come out.

32
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,510
- What for?
- Tell him!

33
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,955
- What for?
- Just tell him!

34
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,473
What for?

35
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,633
Is this a TV game show?

36
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,268
Quit hollering!

37
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,876
You guys made enough noise
last night!

38
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,039
You see me last night?
I wasn't here.

39
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,269
Shut up!

40
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,998
Don't play dumb!

41
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,355
- You'll burn next, asshole!
- ldiot!

42
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,073
- You gonna get him?
- Don't asshole me, asshole!

43
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,435
You still there? Beat it!

44
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,833
If I wake him,
he'll get mad. You try!

45
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,389
I hope the cops tan your hide!

46
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,874
Vinz...

47
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,909
Shut up, Sayid.

48
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,993
Shut up? Be nice
or you're history, fuckface!

49
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,435
Go away. You stink!

50
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,480
You want to play
this early? One...

51
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,390
Two...

52
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,675
Three.

53
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,629
You lose.

54
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,233
Fuck your sister.

55
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,039
I told you not to talk about her!

56
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,270
She sucks Donald Duck. Get lost!

57
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,077
Jew boy!

58
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,516
You bogus kike, you're nowhere!

59
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,831
- I saw a cow.
- What?

60
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,876
A cow.

61
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,109
Got some smoke?

62
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,633
In the box.

63
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,792
Last night, during the riot,
I dashed behind a building:

64
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,474
Wham! I ran right into a cow.

65
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,675
Really?

66
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,190
Stop smoking,
your brain's fried!

67
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,669
Off my bed!
I'll say you're taking drugs!

68
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,195
I'll cut your throat, hang you up,

69
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,954
you'll drown in your blood!

70
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,030
Granma!

71
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,479
Get off the bed.

72
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,195
You get out.

73
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,509
Stay off my bed!

74
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,956
Get lost, you snitch!

75
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,951
Move it.

76
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,236
Watch your mouth with my sister!

77
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,675
- Got any salt?
- Respect your granma!

78
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,955
You my father?

79
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,314
What about Dad?

80
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,040
You my mother now?

81
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,034
Go to school!

82
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,952
It burned down.

83
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,951
Burned down! Savages!

84
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,476
Start that way and soon
you'll skip temple!

85
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,471
- Granma!
- What?

86
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,789
I didn't burn the school!

87
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,679
And you don't go to temple!

88
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,910
You win! I surrender!

89
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,435
If everyone ran from an argument,

90
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,591
there'd be a stampede, already!

91
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,399
But we'd all be going
the same way!

92
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,789
Mazeltov!

93
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,718
You talkin' to me?

94
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,754
You talkin' to me,
mothafucka!

95
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,394
...the guy says: "For cash,
I'd even murder!"

96
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,791
He tells his friend:
"I'd even waste you."

97
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,996
The friend freaks,
so the guy says:

98
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,628
"Don't worry, you're a buddy.

99
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,315
"l won't waste you for cash,
I'll do it for free!"

100
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,789
What a killer line! "For free!"

101
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,396
"I'll waste you for free!"
What a line, Vinz!

102
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,595
I got it the first time.

103
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,479
Tell your brother to come see me!

104
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,349
What a killer put-down!
"I'll waste you for free!"

105
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,590
Shut up and gimme the joint.

106
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,192
- A killer line!
- Killer.

107
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,275
"I'd waste you for free."
Can't do better than that!

108
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,716
Why you so uptight?

109
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,356
Mothafucka!

110
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,714
Bastards wrecked everything!

111
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,548
Check that!

112
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,676
I don't believe it!

113
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,436
How'd they get the car in?

114
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,717
The doorway's too narrow.

115
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,030
Chill, Sayid! There he is.

116
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,630
He must be pissed off.

117
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,634
Took him two years to get this gym!

118
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,836
Your dope's good, Vinz.

119
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,076
Not mine. It's Hubert's.

120
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,996
Don't bogart, Sayid.

121
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,752
Thought you quit smoking?

122
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,273
Me too.

123
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,271
What happened here?

124
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,714
Guess.

125
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,359
A fire?

126
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,875
You win the prize, Einstein!

127
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,473
Kiss mine, cousin!

128
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,995
I knew it'd go up
in smoke one day.

129
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,469
So why'd you bust ass to get it?

130
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,631
'Cause he wanted to, dickface!

131
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,994
You're the dick.

132
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,798
You know who did it?

133
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,672
I don't want to know.

134
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,432
How'd the car get in here?

135
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,190
The doorway's not big enough.

136
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,279
We dissed them, spit on them!

137
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,034
But the cops didn't move an inch.

138
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,159
Then the mothers stepped aside
to make a path...

139
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,631
Then these plainclothes pigs
came out with wooden clubs.

140
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,678
They hit a homeboy,
like real bad!

141
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,513
Kept clubbing him
till we tore into 'em.

142
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,956
I kicked a pig right in the head!

143
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,635
That's a Yamaha.

144
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,315
More like your Mom on a Harley!

145
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,119
It's Mohammed's bike.
He fixed the exhaust.

146
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,748
No, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!

147
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,273
Which Mohammed?

148
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,999
Farida's brother?

149
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,151
Farida with the driver's licence?

150
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,470
No, Farida from the supermarket.

151
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,031
Anyway, it was a scene.

152
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,159
You should've been there Hubert.
It was intense.

153
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,829
Tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop,

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,672
all the fists you can eat,

155
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,512
getting hell at home:

156
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,116
sorry cousin, but I ain't buyin'!

157
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,789
Gimme a break! It was war
against the pigs, in living color!

158
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,032
I was trying to make some cash.

159
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,760
Your bogus riot fucked it up!

160
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,433
When a brother goes down,
I stand up!

161
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,832
What brother?
Do I know the guy?

162
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,670
I won't take hits for
a homeboy gangsta I don't know.

163
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,909
Let's go.

164
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,159
I mean it!

165
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,958
Abdel's no gangsta.

166
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,795
OK, but I'm not faster
than a speeding bullet!

167
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,149
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!

168
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,309
Gimme one.

169
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,674
And go broke?

170
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,239
Don't make us cry!

171
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,994
I'll make you cry, Sayid!

172
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,157
Everyone pays the same!

173
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,515
Except Hubert, it's his building.

174
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,635
A buck?

175
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,756
A buck for one, OK two!

176
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,753
You're a drag!

177
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,239
You should try one.

178
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,550
- Got a buck?
- Yeah, for me!

179
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,357
Here.

180
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,637
No way, I'll remember this!

181
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,472
- So remember.
- Never forget.

182
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,629
Don't be a jerk. I'll pay later.

183
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,674
How? With your sister?

184
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,070
Don't talk that way about her!

185
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,310
Chill out, you bogus Arab!

186
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,438
Sayid!
Come back with that!

187
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,588
Got any change?

188
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,910
We're broke!

189
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,317
- 2 bits.
- We're broke.

190
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,519
...The judge says I go to jail,

191
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,398
or do jobs for the City.

192
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,790
Community service? The pits!

193
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,793
Ever do it? Jail's bad enough!

194
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,712
You'd rather do time?

195
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,513
Your bro stole a dog!

196
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,910
- Liar!
- His mouth is full!

197
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,433
Put it on my tab.

198
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,397
Liar! Your nose is growing!

199
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,957
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!

200
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,908
Beat it!

201
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,912
A.45!

202
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,717
Like the gun in "Lethal Weapon."

203
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,759
We saw that movie together!
It was a 9mm. Glock!

204
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,151
- What?
- No, it wasn't!

205
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,356
That was a Desert Eagle.

206
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,232
He shot at the truck!

207
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,550
That wasn't "Lethal Weapon"!

208
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,833
What are you talking about?

209
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,958
A cop lost his handgun
during the riot.

210
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,678
That's a good one!

211
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,197
I don't know the pig
who lost his piece.

212
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,353
But I'd like to know
who found it!

213
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,075
No joke!

214
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,073
... I'll sleep, eat, lift weights.

215
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,708
Everyone's been inside, except me.

216
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,955
A month for theft
is pathetic!

217
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,589
Not in your league!

218
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,594
- What league? I was never inside!
- You got nabbed.

219
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,709
I quit in time!

220
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,710
Come look!

221
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,632
We got visitors.

222
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,836
Over here!

223
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,236
It's the mayor!

224
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,473
Up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor!
Mothafucka!

225
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,112
Cut the stereo!

226
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,989
Who's in charge here?
You, Nordeen?

227
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,871
What's going on here?

228
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,190
Think you're in Disneyland?

229
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,477
You're not allowed up here.
You gotta go down.

230
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,868
We're causing no trouble.

231
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,874
Still, you've got
to get off the roof.

232
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,598
We like it up here.

233
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,954
Off the roof.

234
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,070
You learn that shit at Notre Dame?

235
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,959
Cut it out! Quiet everyone!

236
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,311
- I'll handle this!
- Forget it!

237
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,351
You can't stay here!

238
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,231
So fold your little tents,
grab your chairs...

239
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,073
and let's all go downstairs
nice and easy.

240
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,037
OK!

241
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,270
Who's gonna make us leave?

242
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,432
Your goons or you,
in your little uniform?

243
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,795
Nordeen, we're doing our job.

244
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,553
Leave us alone!

245
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,878
Don't talk to me like that,
I don't know you.

246
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,995
Now get lost!

247
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,434
Sitting duck!

248
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,670
Your mother drinks Bud!

249
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,717
Anyone who wants to stay, stay!
Heat's off.

250
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,599
- I'm staying
- You're going.

251
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,637
Let me stay, Nordeen.

252
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,870
- What did I say?
- You said go.

253
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,917
- So what do you do?
- I go!

254
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,151
OK, I'm going!

255
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,197
Vinz, c'mon!

256
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,392
Don't play tough guy!

257
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,790
You always wimp out!

258
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,552
...You see 'em in porn stores.

259
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,073
What are they called?

260
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,355
G-strings.

261
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,158
- What?
- G-strings, moron.

262
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,754
She had one on, I swear it.

263
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,592
I fucked her like an animal.

264
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,751
We were in the room...

265
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,239
she kept screaming for more.

266
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,836
Guy next door pounded
the wall we were so noisy.

267
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
You dreamt you fucked her!

268
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,391
What?

269
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,234
- You know the bitch?
- I know her, she has AlDS.

270
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,960
Get outta here!

271
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,395
- Hi, we're from TV.
- What's this?

272
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,551
Were you in the riot last night?

273
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,233
Did you break things, burn cars?

274
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,836
- We look like looters, lady?
- I didn't say that.

275
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,116
- So what do we look like?
- Nothing special.

276
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,919
Get out the car! This ain't Thoiry.

277
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,713
We got work to do.

278
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,270
What kind of work?
Stirring up shit?

279
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,511
- For a juicy scoop!
- No camera!

280
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,717
Quit snooping in the 'hood,
fuckface! Stop taping!

281
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,158
Quit taping, dickhead!

282
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,474
This ain't Thoiry!

283
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,951
What's with all the assholes today?

284
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,793
That fuckin' broad...

285
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,389
What's Thoiry?

286
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,755
A drive-in safari park.

287
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,712
This ain't no zoo!

288
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,991
Open up, WalMart!

289
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,035
You fuckin' jerks.

290
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,350
Talk nice, we're in France.

291
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,835
It's 1 p.m. and you're in bed?

292
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,756
What's with the hair net?

293
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,758
Lay off!

294
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,635
You a movie star, WalMart?

295
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,395
What's this shitty TV?

296
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,232
Watch where you sit!

297
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,674
Just sweat pants!

298
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,434
Where's the new TV?

299
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,749
It's too big to move.

300
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,957
I came by for my cash.
Where were you?

301
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,032
I don't have it.

302
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,350
Don't you know what happened?

303
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,749
Go see what your pals did.

304
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,238
Foued's brother did that.

305
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,277
So what?

306
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,396
Give me his address.

307
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,791
Look what he did to my car!

308
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,712
Look what he did!

309
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,075
Just look!

310
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,151
Leave that alone.

311
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,393
I lost ten grand!
I can't work now.

312
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,393
WalMart, it's just a car!

313
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,591
That's what you say!

314
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,512
You don't realize.

315
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,716
It's all I got.

316
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,757
Cut it out!

317
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,989
Leave that alone!

318
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,832
A homeboy's dying,
fuck your car!

319
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,390
"A homeboy!"
Big deal!

320
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,239
You disgust me!

321
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,472
That car's all I have.
It's my life!

322
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,633
- They're showing the riot!
- My car's more important!

323
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,028
Look, the riot.

324
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,838
- Some TV!
- Sure, bust it!

325
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,151
- Fix the antenna!
- I'm trying!

326
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,076
It's David!

327
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,959
How'd he get on TV?

328
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,759
I was over there,
they missed me!

329
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,595
- Fix it! I can't see a thing!
- This TV sucks!

330
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,994
How'd that fucker get on TV?

331
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,155
Hey, gimme my money!

332
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,231
I don't have it. Snoopy has it.

333
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,392
Gimme my coat
and get outta my face!

334
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,516
You guys must be happy.

335
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,148
A cop lost his gun in the riot.

336
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,511
I hope the guy who finds it

337
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,989
uses it uptown, not here for once!

338
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,797
Forget it,

339
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,518
we'll get even!

340
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,760
You know that show,
"Candid Camera"?

341
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,675
So this celebrity's sure
he's been set up.

342
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,113
His buddy's fixed it
with the camera guys.

343
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,589
The celebrity thinks
they're out to get him.

344
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,274
He always eats
in the same joint.

345
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,398
He's sure
they'll film him there.

346
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,075
The others convince him
there's a hidden camera.

347
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,710
He sees the TV truck,
a camera behind the mirror

348
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,190
and the guy with him
pretends to act weird.

349
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,671
The celebrity thinks
he'll fool 'em,

350
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,719
pretending he hasn't noticed.

351
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,190
He thinks all hell
will break loose.

352
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,876
But they just film him, jumpy,
waiting for shit to happen.

353
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,314
So you see this guy...

354
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,550
Cut it out, Sayid!

355
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,029
- Wasn't me!
- Then who?

356
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,352
The celebrity's sweating,
trying to act cool.

357
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,159
Each time the waiter passes

358
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,117
he thinks it'll happen.

359
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,955
Then a guy asks him
for his autograph.

360
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,111
The celeb thinks it's a trick

361
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,635
and starts ranting at the guy,

362
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,191
who doesn't know what's up,
so he gets mad.

363
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,158
They start fighting,

364
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,788
and the Candid Camera guys
have to break it up.

365
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,633
It was a killer punch out.

366
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,274
Then what?

367
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,032
That's all.

368
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,473
Who was the celebrity?

369
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,790
Dunno, but he was real famous.

370
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,474
I don't remember.

371
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,235
This looks like trouble.
See ya.

372
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,990
WE'RE THE FUTURE

373
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,679
What did they want?

374
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,868
"Don't get mad, get even."

375
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,794
It's Abdel's brother.
He's got a pump gun.

376
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,310
Party time!

377
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,435
We go visit Abdel
in the hospital?

378
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,517
I gotta show you something...

379
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,199
That's real steel!

380
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,954
- Get a load of it.
- What a mother!

381
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,389
What'll you do with it?

382
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,549
Stop it, Hubert.

383
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,675
What you gonna do with it?

384
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,637
Depends if Abdel dies.

385
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,711
You gonna kill a cop?

386
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,438
Best way to get respect!

387
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,114
Smoking a cop
will get you respect?

388
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,236
It'll even up the score.

389
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,437
- I coulda got you a piece.
- This one's special.

390
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,199
Think you're on a mission?

391
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,989
Well, I did find the gun.
Leave me alone!

392
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,232
- Will it help Abdel?
- lt'll help us.

393
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,875
Stop fronting!

394
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,439
You pussy!

395
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,073
You're headed for big shit!

396
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,912
I'll do my thing, you do yours.

397
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,436
- I don't want to know.
- So don't ask!

398
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,992
One thing's sure...

399
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,318
with that piece
you're the big man.

400
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,957
Hey, wait for me!

401
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,353
Fuck it...

402
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,671
What the fuck ya doin'?

403
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,673
OK, don't have a shit fit!

404
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,838
Sorry, fellas, you can't go in.

405
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,638
Let us in. We came to see Abdel.

406
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,631
Sorry, I have my orders.

407
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,190
Just a couple of minutes.
Then we'll leave.

408
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,759
He's our friend.

409
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,637
The docs won't let you in.
He's in a coma.

410
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,358
We won't make trouble!

411
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,871
If I let you in,

412
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,110
- I'll lose my job.
- Sure, flunkey!

413
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,033
Tone it down.
His family's here.

414
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,236
They need peace and quiet!

415
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,631
We're not as good as reporters?

416
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,994
Get going!

417
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,198
Hands off, man!

418
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,036
You gonna make me leave?

419
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,270
Gonna shoot me?
Pull out your pop gun!

420
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,273
What's going on here?

421
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,919
Look at that fuckface!

422
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,354
We came to see our pal Abdel!

423
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,591
We won't leave till we see him.

424
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,671
Beat it, before I take you in.

425
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,909
Oh, yeah?

426
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,308
You shut up!

427
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,230
Move 'em out!

428
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,796
We can be nice or nasty.
It's up to you!

429
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,199
Calm down!

430
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,194
Lieut., these kids made trouble.

431
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,351
I got the ringleader.

432
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,318
- He did nothing.
- I arrested the leader.

433
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,277
- What leader?
- He means Sayid.

434
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,270
Sure, Uncle Tom!

435
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,476
Things aren't bad enough.

436
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,756
You had to go to the hospital?

437
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,468
They were only doing their job.

438
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,198
Doing their job?

439
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,920
Shut your yap, once and for all!

440
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,310
- You shut yours!
- Don't talk to me like that!

441
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,074
- Same to you!
- Shut up, will ya!

442
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,389
Shit!

443
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,073
You don't know a fucking thing!

444
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,275
What do you know?

445
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,192
Cut it out, asshole.

446
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,430
- Watch your tongue!
- If you watch yours!

447
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,193
The bastards who beat up Abdel
will go to jail!

448
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,237
You're dreaming.

449
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,198
The cops at the hospital

450
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,271
protect Abdel and his family.

451
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,599
You just fuck things up!

452
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,078
You idiot, you got it all wrong.

453
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,672
Those cops
are just protecting Abdel!

454
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,909
Most cops don't beat on you.
They protect you!

455
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,430
Who protects us from you?

456
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,998
Never do it again!

457
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,673
Who writes your jokes?

458
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,796
Watch your tongue!

459
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,712
Watch your mother!

460
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,311
You ever trash me again,

461
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,436
you go to central lock-up.

462
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,273
Your brother can bail you out.

463
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,954
- I didn't ask no favors.
- I did it for your brother.

464
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,350
He'd rip you apart!

465
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,318
You're the ripper.

466
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,349
About the boxing gym:
I can get you a City grant.

467
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,750
You'll get another gym.

468
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,156
Kids want to punch
more than bags now!

469
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,199
It's hopeless. Once I could talk
to the kids. No more.

470
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,115
And they know me!
A rookie cop wouldn't last a month.

471
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,794
An Arab in a police station
doesn't last an hour!

472
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,318
I have to go.
Try to keep cool.

473
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,994
Yeah, we'll try.

474
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,674
Outta my face, you fucker!

475
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,273
OK!

476
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,595
You shook his hand?

477
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,876
He's always been cool with me.

478
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,076
You don't shake a pig's hand!

479
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,791
You shoot him, I shake his hand!
You're a fuckin'pain!

480
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,951
And you're out of it!
Look!

481
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,236
I knew it!

482
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,152
You acted so weird
at the hospital.

483
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,151
- Take it easy.
- Let me see.

484
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,989
You didn't tell us?

485
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,233
You didn't want to know!

486
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,231
Packing that!
You retard!

487
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,994
I'm a big boy.
Quit preaching!

488
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,038
I'll bust your chops!

489
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,435
Stop it!

490
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,149
You feel big with that gun!
I'll kick your ass!

491
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,355
Like how?

492
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,239
Cut it out.
Let's grab a sandwich.

493
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,472
You shut up!

494
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,955
I'm splittin'.

495
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,792
So split!

496
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,392
Stay with us.

497
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,153
Sayid, let him split!

498
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,476
Don't go!

499
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,868
Back off.

500
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,716
What's with him?

501
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,515
Jerk thinks too much.

502
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,956
- Where's Mom?
- Explain this to me.

503
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,997
I can't now.

504
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,874
Well?

505
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,069
What's the answer?

506
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,116
I don't know.

507
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,748
- You never know.
- OK, I never know.

508
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,439
Hi, Mom.

509
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,039
How's the kid brother?

510
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,519
He's fine.

511
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,991
But your brother
in jail isn't so good.

512
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,673
What's with Max?

513
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,956
He needs textbooks.

514
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,519
What for?

515
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,355
To get a high school diploma
while he's inside.

516
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,119
He never made grade school!

517
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,476
Hands off the pots!

518
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,548
I didn't do nothing!

519
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,115
I dunno how I'll buy his books.

520
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,429
By the way...

521
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,713
There's the money
for the power bill.

522
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,510
- And my machine?
- What machine?

523
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,990
My new sewing machine!

524
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,754
Shit, I forgot to ask WalMart.

525
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,514
Mine's ready to croak.

526
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,910
Patou, go study in your room.

527
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,640
- Mom.
- Don't argue.

528
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,075
Who's WalMart?
That fence in Tower B?

529
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,231
No, he's in Tower D.

530
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,958
I don't know him.

531
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,031
Could he get us textbooks?

532
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,872
That's not his line, Mom.

533
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,632
Officials now admit

534
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,429
that a policeman lost his gun
in the riot last night.

535
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,591
It is still missing.

536
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,673
We asked locals
if a loose gun is dangerous

537
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,956
in this explosive situation...

538
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,309
What a fuck up!

539
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,391
They burned down the gym.

540
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,869
I'm sick of the projects.
I want out. It's getting worse.

541
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,998
I'm sure Vinz helped
torch the gym.

542
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,509
He's going wild, like Max.

543
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,558
I have to get out.

544
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,113
I have to leave this place.

545
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,756
If you see a grocery,
buy me a lettuce.

546
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,115
No credit for you.

547
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,716
My granma's a regular here!
So I'm 2 bits short!

548
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,118
You're not your granma.

549
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,478
- Hands off!
- Just looking!

550
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,870
- Got two bits?
- How about one?

551
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,110
- One OK?
- One not OK.

552
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,112
Gimme a coin, you dinosaur!

553
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,793
No coins for you.

554
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,916
OK... Now what?

555
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,036
So what'll it be?

556
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,872
- I saw you!
- You saw what?

557
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,634
Gimme the red peppers.
They're cheaper.

558
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,828
My granma'll kill me!
She hates 'em.

559
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,390
So shoot the Chink,
grab the green peppers!

560
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,437
It'll make granma's day!

561
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,438
Fuck,
fuck the po-lice...

562
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,799
He's intense.

563
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,555
Killer!

564
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,198
A mother killer!

565
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,638
Sayid, check out the cow.

566
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,836
Fuck off with your cow!

567
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,719
- I swear!
- You said you'd cut my hair.

568
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,836
The same cow! I saw it!

569
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,274
You're the cow!

570
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,908
It was the same fuckin' cow!

571
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,672
You gotta believe me!

572
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,955
Shut up!

573
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,071
I'm Señor Duck...

574
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,998
I fucka you,
I fucka her, I fucka him...

575
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,436
OK Granma!
So they're red peppers!

576
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,828
You know this cow business.

577
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,672
It's a weird trip.

578
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,276
Don't wreck my hair!

579
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,954
I gotta get laid!
So watch it!

580
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,951
I can mow a lawn, I'll try.

581
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,757
A lawn?

582
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,876
Sit your ass down.

583
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,597
- It's hot, Vinz
- What?

584
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,512
A cop's piece is hot.

585
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,070
You said that already.
Sit still, loser!

586
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,159
I'll whack you.

587
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,078
Don't move.

588
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,311
If Abdel dies, you'll kill?

589
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,711
Wanna be the next Arab
iced by the pigs?

590
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,791
Well, me neither.

591
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,871
So now you're an Arab!

592
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,076
They think we're full of shit.

593
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,232
But I'm not bullshitting
about this, Sayid.

594
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,268
Watch it!

595
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,839
It's cool.

596
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,958
Is this gun legit for a cop?
...What'd you do?

597
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,917
Nothing, I swear it!

598
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,355
Why swear?

599
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,714
Because it's nothing.

600
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,108
I'm cold there!

601
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,635
It's cold in this room!

602
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,912
I'll even it out,
it'll be great!

603
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,469
I got a date! Lemme see!

604
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,312
No fuckin' trust!

605
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,109
I didn't see!

606
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,474
You didn't look!

607
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,349
Trust me, dammit!

608
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,633
It's a nice hole.

609
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,153
A nice what?

610
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,198
Trust me, or no haircut!

611
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,719
Look at me, Sayid!

612
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,472
Get outta here!

613
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,278
Don't get bummed out!

614
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,870
It's the style in New York.

615
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,793
The killer cut, so stop whining!

616
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,836
New York?

617
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,515
They got hair like this
in New York? I look punk!

618
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,476
Honest!

619
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,675
Don't laugh!

620
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,195
Give us a kiss, Sayid.

621
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,952
Outta my face!

622
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,873
No hard feelings, sucker!

623
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,348
Hey pooch,
your master's an asshole!

624
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,839
There's your sister.

625
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,950
- Why're you here?
- And you?

626
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,156
I'm asking the questions!

627
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,635
You should be in school.

628
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,115
Get outta here!

629
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,596
Get lost, you cows.

630
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,153
You still here?

631
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,994
Get lost!

632
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,998
You talk to my friends!

633
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,639
To Vincent.

634
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,509
The name's Vinz, not Vincent!
And don't talk to him!

635
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,558
- Get a move on!
- Don't push!

636
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,716
- Coming tonight?
- Where?

637
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,713
Jason's brother's in a prize fight.

638
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,075
- Got tickets?
- Freebies.

639
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,593
Killer!

640
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,958
Who cut your hair, Sayid?

641
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,231
Kids these days!

642
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,510
Check that!

643
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,592
Shit's happenin'!

644
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,830
Abdel's my brother, pig!

645
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,673
You're gonna pay!

646
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,270
Step on it!

647
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,029
It's stalled!

648
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,071
Outta the car, freeze!

649
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,750
Drop the gun!

650
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,439
Freeze!

651
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,755
Get back!

652
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,153
Get the fuck out!

653
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,436
Riot cops are coming!

654
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,591
Get back, scum!

655
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,237
Vinz, Hubert, this way!

656
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,239
This way!

657
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,635
Freeze!

658
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,791
You crazy?

659
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,349
Where were you?

660
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,876
We fucked your mother!

661
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,836
I swear the pig was
right in my sights.

662
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,878
I had him like I have you now!

663
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,794
The sucker froze,
shit his pants.

664
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,110
Without Hubert,
I'd have smoked him!

665
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,111
Right in the mother!

666
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,511
Hubert slugged him so hard
he went into orbit!

667
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,351
No!

668
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,714
I swear it!

669
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,199
Slugged a pig?

670
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,037
You were great!

671
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,392
THE WORLD lS YOURS

672
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,911
Now what do we do?

673
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,391
I gotta call to get my bucks.

674
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,597
Got Snoopy's address?

675
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,674
I'll wait, but not forever!

676
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,158
This cost me a $3 chocolate milk!
I'd better collect!

677
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,200
You want some, Vinz?

678
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,555
- Want some?
- No.

679
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,789
You sure?

680
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,316
Want some, Cousin Hubie?

681
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,871
You're already chocolate!

682
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,794
Will you guys stop sulking?

683
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,277
Who's sulking? Not me!

684
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,078
- Unbelievable!
- Ask him!

685
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,753
A couple of kids!

686
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,754
- Who's the kid?
- 2 kids worrying over jackshit!

687
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,309
I'm 1 00% behind you!

688
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,275
Wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!

689
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,359
Tell your buddy to back off!
I never said I wanted to.

690
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,351
Yes, you did!

691
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,270
- Yes!
- No!

692
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,192
I didn't say that!

693
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,316
I said if Abdel died,

694
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,119
I'd smoke a cop.
Not for the hell of it!

695
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,431
Without my gun back there,

696
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,352
we'd have been history!

697
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,636
My name's not Rodney King!

698
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,472
Not the same thing!

699
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,837
Expect us to bring you
gifts in jail?

700
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,433
I expect nothing!
Not from a guy who kisses cop ass!

701
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,472
Go ahead, laugh!

702
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,392
Laugh!

703
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,552
I'm fuckin' sick
of the goddam system!

704
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,429
We live in rat holes,
you do fuck-all to change things!

705
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,591
Neither do you!

706
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,109
You're my homeys,
so I'll tell you:

707
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,111
If Abdel dies, I hit back.

708
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,077
I'll whack a pig!

709
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,431
So they know we don't turn
the other cheek now!

710
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,638
Wow, what a speech!

711
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,519
Half Moses, half Mickey Mouse.

712
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,150
Forget it, Vinz.
You're out of your league.

713
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,880
If Abdel dies, we lose a friend?

714
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,756
Right!

715
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,480
If a cop dies,
do all cops go away?

716
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,428
You're just one guy!
You can't blow 'em all away!

717
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,591
Who made you a preacher?

718
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,320
You know what's right and wrong?

719
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,233
Why do you side with the assholes?

720
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,436
Who's the asshole?

721
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,912
In school we learnt
that hate breeds hate!

722
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,072
I didn't go to school,
I'm from the street!

723
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,798
Know what it taught me?

724
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,475
Turn the other cheek,
you're dead mothafucka!

725
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,995
Bullshit! You pointed a gun
at a cop! We coulda been killed!

726
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,071
Nothing like a good shit!

727
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,193
You believe in God?
That's the wrong question.

728
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,555
Does God believe in us?

729
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,230
I once had a friend
called Grunwalski.

730
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,472
We were sent to Siberia together.

731
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,196
When you go to a Siberian work camp,

732
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,113
you travel in a cattle car.

733
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,193
You roll across icy steppes
for days,

734
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,555
without seeing a soul.

735
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,995
You huddle to keep warm.

736
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,751
But it's hard to relieve yourself,
to take a shit,

737
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,229
you can't do it on the train,

738
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,198
and the only time the train stops

739
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,875
is to take on water
for the locomotive.

740
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,952
But Grunwalski was shy.

741
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,315
Even when we bathed together,

742
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,075
he got upset.

743
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,550
I used to kid him about it.

744
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,590
So, the train stops and everyone
jumps out to shit

745
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,591
on the tracks.

746
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,991
I'd teased Grunwalski so much

747
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,232
that he went off on his own.

748
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,153
The train starts moving,

749
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,470
so everyone jumps on,

750
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,194
because it waits for nobody.

751
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,910
Grunwalski had a problem:

752
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,992
he'd gone behind a bush

753
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,037
and was still shitting.

754
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,519
So I see him come out
from behind the bush,

755
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,989
holding up his pants

756
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,117
with his hands.

757
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,834
He tries to catch up.

758
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,117
I hold out my hand,

759
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,999
but each time he reaches for it

760
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,832
he lets go of his pants

761
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,195
and they drop to his ankles.

762
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,232
He pulls them back up,

763
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,072
starts running again,

764
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,550
but they fall back down,

765
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,075
when he reaches out for me.

766
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,630
- Then what happened?
- Nothing.

767
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,439
Grunwalski...

768
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,312
froze to death.

769
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,196
Good day.

770
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,552
Why'd he tell us that?

771
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,875
I got the address. I'll call you.

772
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,032
Why'd he tell us that?

773
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,635
'Scuse me,
I'm just out of the hospital.

774
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,791
I haven't eaten for 2 days.

775
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,635
My child's hungry,
I need your spare change...

776
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,274
I wanna date with Mina!

777
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,271
I'll lasso her!

778
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,874
What d'you want?
My dad's in jail,

779
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,474
my mom's in jail,
my whole family is!

780
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,631
Get a job like everyone else!

781
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,354
What is this, Mardi Gras?

782
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,992
I want Mina!

783
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,637
I'm homeless,
my welfare ran out.

784
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,714
I got out of a halfway house...

785
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,269
It's a block away.

786
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,157
Thanks.

787
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,719
Have a nice day, sir.

788
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,915
Thanks.

789
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,595
The pigs are fuckin' polite
around here!

790
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,836
Even called me sir!

791
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,995
Maybe he won the lottery!

792
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,755
Damn, it's locked!

793
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,990
What's his real name?

794
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,833
I only know him as Snoopy.

795
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,473
- Yes?
- Sorry to bother you.

796
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,232
I'm looking for...

797
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,595
Snoopy.

798
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,316
- It sounds weird.
- Very funny!

799
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,271
The fucker hung up.

800
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,274
You try.

801
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,396
- Why me?
- Try!

802
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,871
Darkie and me
will get shot at!

803
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,953
- Hello.
- Yes?

804
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,917
Is Snoopy there?

805
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,711
No, but Charlie Brown is!

806
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,279
You fucked it up, you asshole!

807
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,509
Stop that!

808
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,398
Sorry to bother you.

809
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,712
Our pal Snoopy lives here,
we don't know his real name.

810
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,111
Stop ringing!
You thinka da world is yours?

811
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,111
Unreal!

812
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,517
No, we're staying!

813
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,951
So call the cops, you spic!

814
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,836
Sayid?

815
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,194
Snoopy?

816
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,916
- What floor?
- 5th.

817
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,229
We're coming!

818
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,392
Snoopy?
Is no name!

819
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,312
You always make-a trouble!

820
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,916
- Were you followed?
- No.

821
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,718
- No one?
- Nobody!

822
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,108
- You sure?
- Why?

823
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,474
Because...

824
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:50,757
You cool?

825
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,239
Great!

826
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,833
Check that kitchen.

827
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,713
Who's this dude?

828
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,199
Nice space!
You win the lottery?

829
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,875
A guy loaned it to me.
He ain't gettin' it back!

830
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,077
This is no apartment,
it's a palace!

831
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,389
I don't believe it.

832
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,835
Bitchin' apartment!

833
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,798
Snoopy, meet Vinz.

834
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,752
This is Cousin Hubert!

835
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,633
We've met before!

836
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,038
- Line of coke?
- No.

837
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,713
- You sure?
- No thanks.

838
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,519
A little line of coke?

839
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,194
No one for coke?

840
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,516
- How's your bro?
- OK.

841
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,352
Mean fuckin' dude!

842
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,715
- He still a maniac?
- And you?

843
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,791
Fuckin' A!
Watch!

844
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,913
So you got my cash?

845
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,429
My bread!

846
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,831
Make it snappy, Snoopy!

847
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,036
Cut the bullshit!

848
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,389
Come get it.

849
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,150
Comin' at you, Bruce Lee!

850
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,877
- Hands off!
- What?

851
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,395
Not for kids! It's my gun!

852
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,999
So what? I got a piece too.

853
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,915
Let's see!

854
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,079
Whip it out.

855
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,836
Fuck!

856
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,274
Don't, Vinz!

857
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,549
He knows guns.

858
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,917
A snub-nosed
Smith & Wesson Magnum 44.

859
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,749
Watch it!

860
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,955
It's loaded.

861
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,115
Mean piece.

862
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,479
You're a gangsta.

863
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,278
It's for self-defense.

864
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,351
You into magic?

865
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,430
Watch.

866
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,909
One bullet.

867
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,995
I missed.

868
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,669
You're nuts!

869
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,718
- That's live ammo!
- It's an old trick!

870
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,509
Cool it.

871
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,911
We up the stakes: 2 bullets!

872
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,995
Snoopy!

873
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,754
Wiggin' out, guys?

874
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,992
You're nuts.

875
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,229
Gimme!

876
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,155
Your turn.

877
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,151
Let's go, he's fried.

878
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,230
Gonna do it?

879
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,876
- Gimme.
- Do it!

880
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,873
I did it, you do it!

881
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,837
Man, you want trouble?

882
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,638
Do it!

883
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,748
Chill, guys!

884
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,273
Stop, Vinz!

885
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,714
You aiming at me?

886
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,632
You're off your head!

887
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,592
You bet I'm aiming at you!

888
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,796
No one fucks with me!

889
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,035
I'm not some ass-wipe!

890
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,673
Wanna see a gun?

891
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,398
A fuckin' gun?

892
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,956
Sayid, get him out!

893
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,278
We're outta here!

894
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,953
Up your mother's slash, sucker!

895
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,035
Look!

896
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,952
That's right, asshole!

897
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,509
He was bluffing!

898
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,753
Now I'll never get my cash!

899
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,912
Leave us out of your games, Vinz!

900
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,631
Games? We got a pal
in the hospital!

901
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,711
Don't take on the world!

902
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,950
You got the wrong build!

903
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,829
I'm not like you,
Mr. Black Hercules, right?

904
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,228
Go fuck yourself!

905
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,675
Fuck myself?

906
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,632
Alright, kids!

907
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,279
- Who're you?
- Easy!

908
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,510
You had your fun!

909
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,079
Easy!

910
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,718
Search them.

911
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,553
Fast work! In my 'hood,
the cops come

912
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,836
a week after you're dead!

913
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,479
Hey, you!

914
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,393
- You together?
- I don't know them.

915
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,959
Why you here?

916
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,997
I live with my aunt!

917
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,309
What's her name?

918
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,152
Mrs. Zyl...

919
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,559
- Got l. D.?
- I'm on the level...

920
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,597
Easy!

921
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,671
Freeze!

922
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,359
Don't move, boy!

923
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,155
You know him?

924
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,719
- Who?
- Your pal.

925
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,393
I don't know him.

926
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,994
We'll see about that, wise guy!

927
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,991
- This is humiliating!
- Too bad.

928
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,199
What's this?

929
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,034
Good stuff!

930
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,749
I'm keeping it.

931
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,715
Afghan's the best.

932
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,116
Good buzz going up and down.

933
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,748
Same with Black Bombay.

934
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,030
Lebanese can really vary.

935
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,988
This is crap
but I'll keep it...Well?

936
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,477
The little fucker outran me.
Take them in.

937
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,119
- Get in the back.
- Why me?

938
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,599
Get in!

939
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:18,868
Listen, scumbag.
You know what I think of you?

940
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,991
You're like poodle shit
on a sidewalk.

941
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,355
I can't take a step

942
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,718
without squashing
your ugly dog-turd face.

943
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,198
So watch where the dog dumps you!

944
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,434
You're all alone!

945
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,712
Far from the slums...

946
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,633
and your looter pals.

947
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,914
Pick it up with your feet.

948
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,516
Like your people do back home.

949
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,955
They're great with their feet.

950
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,436
This is the hard part.

951
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,517
OK, there's no big hurry.

952
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,796
In 2 hours, they may be free.

953
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,712
Make the most of it.

954
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,715
How 'bout a bullet
in the back of your head?

955
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,952
A nice little bullet?

956
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,395
You gotta stop in time.

957
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,835
You need self-control.

958
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,558
Gotta be a pro.

959
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,280
This takes control.

960
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,836
Don't get mad! It won't last!

961
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,639
You got something to say?

962
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,312
Don't touch him!

963
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,029
You know this one?

964
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,997
The Shanghai Squeeze.

965
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,156
It's an oldie.

966
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,759
Wait, I think he's thirsty.

967
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,799
Fucker!

968
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,030
Don't hurt yourself!

969
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,430
Take it easy!

970
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,476
Don't get me aroused.

971
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,836
You look like a bitch from behind!

972
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,390
A nice bitch to suck me off!

973
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,439
Blow jobs!

974
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,472
Bitches to suck my dick!

975
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,759
That's the way.
Then you relax!

976
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,640
But it's hard to stop in time.

977
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,870
You gotta stay in control.

978
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,989
That's the trick.

979
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,559
I like his face.

980
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,709
He's cute.

981
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,037
What was the name?

982
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,190
- Are you cute?
- Yes! I'm cute!

983
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,120
I'm cute!

984
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,592
- Which one?
- He's Hubert.

985
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,159
That's no Hubert!

986
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,117
He's French, he's Sayid.

987
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,077
Sayid? That's pretty!

988
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,198
Is Sayid a French name?

989
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,635
Aren't they pretty?

990
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,789
Take a good look!

991
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,751
The little guy's excited.

992
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,832
Leave him alone!

993
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,191
It's so easy to go too far!

994
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,318
But you mustn't!
Though you're dying to!

995
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,673
Right, you Arab sonofabitch?

996
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,992
OK, let's go.

997
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,958
Sir!

998
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,917
We'll miss the last train!

999
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,308
Forget it.

1000
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,549
Bastard!

1001
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,314
Did I talk to you?

1002
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,233
Yo, Vinz!

1003
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,312
Where's Sayid and Hubert?

1004
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,789
Dunno. They pissed me off tonight.

1005
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,349
You guys are always fussin'!

1006
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,873
Your sister's hot.

1007
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,790
Shut up, asshole.

1008
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,952
Sorry, but she's hot.

1009
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,917
You don't stand a chance.

1010
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,036
Don't you try.

1011
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,430
Don't even look at her!

1012
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,158
Check the turn!

1013
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,993
I won't try 'cause she's pregnant.

1014
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,994
Don't diss my sis', butthead!

1015
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,231
Brothers,
I gotta make it

1016
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,630
by any means necessary

1017
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,109
'cos my mind's
playin' tricks on me.

1018
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,959
You won't let us in?

1019
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,838
Beat it!

1020
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:44,478
That nigger bouncer
never lets us in!

1021
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,358
We know his bro for 1 0 years!

1022
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,592
And he still gives us shit!

1023
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,712
Drives me crazy!

1024
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,676
What's up with the flare gun?

1025
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,358
Where you going?

1026
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,159
Don't be a hot dog!

1027
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,955
Stop!

1028
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,353
I told you I'd be back!

1029
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,751
Not so big now, fuckface!

1030
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,071
You and your stinkin' club!

1031
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,392
Fuck your club!

1032
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,835
Goddam nigger!

1033
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,232
That cop made us miss it.

1034
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,992
Dickless fuckin' Tracy!

1035
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,678
When's the next one?

1036
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,433
Tomorrow morning.

1037
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,631
How much did Snoopy owe you?

1038
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,550
What?

1039
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,312
What'd he owe you?

1040
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,674
One.

1041
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,990
- $1,000?
- No, $1 00.

1042
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,229
What?

1043
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,630
All this shit for a lousy $1 00!

1044
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,439
It's the principle that counts.

1045
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,078
Principle!

1046
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,629
Coyote's a bad motherfucker.

1047
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,268
Roadrunner's a pussy.

1048
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,875
Pick between Tweetie and Sylvester.

1049
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,238
Fuck you and Tweetie!

1050
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,392
I don't take shit
from a guy who sees cows!

1051
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,791
I say Sylvester's the real gangsta.

1052
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,197
Bottom line! 'Nuff said!

1053
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,875
Can't talk with you guys
if you won't listen.

1054
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,598
'Cause you listen?

1055
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,194
You got it all wrong.

1056
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,319
I say Tweetie's the baddest.
He always wins.

1057
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,113
That's bullshit!

1058
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,119
Sylvester fucks Tweetie and you!

1059
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,994
Come again?

1060
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,870
Who does he fuck? Me?

1061
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,871
Anyway,
Sylvester's a black brother.

1062
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,598
A black brother?

1063
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,115
Full of shit!

1064
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,075
Shall we, gentlemen?

1065
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,992
What can we lose?

1066
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,956
It's positively frightful!

1067
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,318
Is this guy famous?

1068
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,834
He will be when he grows up!

1069
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,870
There's Champagne,
Cinzano, Bogardi...

1070
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,758
- I don't drink.
- I mean Bacardi.

1071
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,909
Outta my way.

1072
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,713
I want peanuts.

1073
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,519
Cheers, Charles!

1074
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,877
Hey, Charles!

1075
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,713
Behave, asshole!

1076
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,514
Let 'em through, Sayid!

1077
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,398
Check out the babes!

1078
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,471
That's what I call women!

1079
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,197
The sister is hot.

1080
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,795
Do me a favor.

1081
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,598
I'm not going!

1082
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,354
Who bought the tacos last week?

1083
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,556
You owe me one.

1084
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,994
Get me the sister.

1085
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,435
Awright.

1086
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,038
There's just two!

1087
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,633
- Who cares?
- Shut up!

1088
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,870
Get her for me, Hubert!

1089
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,149
Excuse me, my name's Hubert.

1090
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,559
My friend's a romantic,
he's really shy.

1091
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,029
He'd love to meet you.

1092
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,553
That's him.

1093
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,555
What d'ya say?

1094
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,915
Look what you did to me!

1095
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,352
He's really cool.

1096
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,717
- He's too nice.
- OK, then!

1097
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,154
C'mon Sayid!

1098
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,309
Hold this.

1099
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,150
Haven't we met before?

1100
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,679
Don't I wish!

1101
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,034
Hi, girls!

1102
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:57,837
I'm Sayid.

1103
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,150
Please don't lean on the painting.

1104
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,355
You're the painting!

1105
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:05,956
I'm good at what?

1106
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,269
Guess, babe!

1107
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,192
We heard you were shy!

1108
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,636
Shy? That's my middle name!

1109
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,868
What's your number?
We'll go out.

1110
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,429
You're all alike!

1111
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,670
He said you wanted to talk.

1112
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,195
Talk? What about?

1113
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,193
Lighten up!
We were ready to talk,

1114
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,273
but with your attitude,
how can we respect you?

1115
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,671
Who are you?
The Wonderbra bitch?

1116
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,229
- Who asked you?
- I'm asking you!

1117
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,958
He's nuts.

1118
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,590
What are you staring at?

1119
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,274
Got a screw loose?

1120
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,351
You're the screw.

1121
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,878
- Stop!
- What's wrong with you?

1122
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,996
Leave us alone,
we didn't ask you over!

1123
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,798
Gentlemen, please!

1124
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,916
It's cool, Pops!

1125
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,789
Nobody's been hurt!
What's your beef?

1126
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,679
- Keep your heads, please.
- Please what?

1127
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,835
Let's go!

1128
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,918
Pretty please!

1129
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,435
Let's all calm down!

1130
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,954
Stop that!

1131
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,439
Stop your friend.

1132
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,239
You're not my friend!
Fuck you!

1133
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,554
Know what?

1134
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,036
Go suck cocks in hell!

1135
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,431
- With your mothers!
- You're all ugly!

1136
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,068
I'm fuckin' sorry, sir!

1137
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,190
Have fun, mothafuckas!

1138
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,673
Troubled youth!

1139
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,671
We shoulda swiped a bottle.

1140
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,718
I got the sucker's charge card!

1141
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,440
Hubert! Up to your old tricks!

1142
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,591
Like riding a bike:
you don't forget.

1143
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,228
Mr. David Moe?

1144
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,838
He's not here?

1145
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,993
We keep it for him!

1146
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,832
Give it to me.

1147
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,272
What's the score?

1148
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,589
Killer!

1149
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,678
Know what I'm saying?

1150
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,036
Your name's not David!

1151
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,077
And cabs don't take plastic.

1152
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,468
Just this once.

1153
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,676
Gimme a break!

1154
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,389
You fart?

1155
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,113
It was you.
Who else?

1156
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,555
It stinks. Had to be you.

1157
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:25,755
That's not my stink.

1158
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,353
I know your farts.

1159
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,875
Mothafucka, we're locked out.

1160
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,389
Who farted?

1161
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,834
- He did.
- He did.

1162
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,357
Can't you tell?

1163
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,199
It was him.

1164
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,510
Your ass reeks.

1165
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,876
Motherfucking
goddam steering wheel!

1166
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,076
Cut the poetry

1167
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,037
and pull the thing!

1168
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,476
Jean-Claude does this
in five seconds flat.

1169
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,709
Which Jean-Claude?

1170
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,869
The mailman?

1171
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,476
No, that's Sylvie's boyfriend.

1172
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,029
This guy got 2 years
for car theft.

1173
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,316
Move it,
bust the fucker!

1174
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,597
Use your foot!

1175
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,634
Don't be a sissy.

1176
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,075
Who's a sissy?

1177
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,550
Relax, Max.

1178
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,311
"Night of the Living Car!"

1179
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,037
The wipers!

1180
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,437
Rip open that plastic box.

1181
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,272
Open sesame!

1182
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,195
Connect the green wire
to the red one.

1183
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,635
Nah, that's for the blinkers.

1184
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,075
How'd they do it in on TV?

1185
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,390
Fuck TV!

1186
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,119
Start the mother!

1187
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,995
Who the fuck's he?

1188
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,878
Freaked me out!

1189
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,512
Who the fuck are you?

1190
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,272
- Huh?
- What you doin'?

1191
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,475
Nothing.

1192
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,398
So go somewhere else.

1193
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,471
Move, you'll get us nabbed.

1194
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,789
It's my wife...

1195
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,029
What about her?

1196
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,230
She left me.

1197
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,230
Do we fuckin' care?

1198
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,156
Don't wait for the law, start it.

1199
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,038
Move!

1200
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,316
The red wire to the green wire.

1201
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,040
Lay off, that's for the horn!

1202
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,349
Try the blue, jerk!

1203
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,516
You do it! If you're so smart.

1204
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,829
I'll kill you!!

1205
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,232
You're a drag.

1206
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,236
That wire's for the horn.

1207
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:16,830
No, that's the horn!

1208
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,632
Sayid's right.

1209
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,631
You see?

1210
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,598
Who was right?
We do it my way!

1211
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,318
Gimme some metal!

1212
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,879
Move it!

1213
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,031
You're a good guy.
What's your name?

1214
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,678
You got a name?

1215
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,634
At least we put it to good use!

1216
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,429
Ready? Watch this.

1217
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,632
Anyone know how to drive?

1218
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,474
- Vinz does.
- Wait a second.

1219
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,200
I never learned,
I got no licence.

1220
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,476
He does. He was in the Army.

1221
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,835
The Navy! I can't drive.

1222
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,628
I can!

1223
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,119
Shut up!

1224
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,875
- Vinz?
- What?

1225
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,999
You took that bitch
around lsrael in a Mercedes.

1226
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,233
Not the same thing!

1227
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,470
That was different. It was... uh...

1228
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,029
It was an automatic...

1229
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,430
More like a dream!

1230
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,951
You guys are so lame!

1231
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,318
Now what?

1232
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,197
Sorry,
but a cop car's coming.

1233
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,316
- Where?
- That's a cop car.

1234
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,469
It's real close.

1235
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,389
On three, we're outta here, OK?

1236
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:51,631
Ready?

1237
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,277
Three!

1238
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,873
Freeze!

1239
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,433
Out of the way!

1240
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,112
"You down with OCB?"

1241
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,872
"Yeah, you know me..."

1242
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,553
"You're down with OCB?"

1243
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,517
"Yeah, you know me..."

1244
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,557
"Yeah, you know me..."

1245
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,360
Sometimes you feel
so fuckin' small...

1246
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,791
Got any more bullshit wisdom?

1247
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,758
"The early bird catches the worm."

1248
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,309
"A stitch in time saves nine."

1249
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,313
"Haste makes waste."

1250
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,835
"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."

1251
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,037
I save that one
for special occasions.

1252
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,995
Holy fuck!

1253
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,630
I'm wasted.

1254
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,916
Your shit is dope!

1255
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,875
Sayid, watch it!

1256
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,310
He's a big boy!

1257
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,311
- Spray cans!
- You're the can!

1258
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,556
What was that old guy
in the john trying to say?

1259
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:05,110
Talked about God and shitting.
What was the point?

1260
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,633
I see skinheads.

1261
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,994
You're the skinhead.

1262
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,036
Fuck Nazis!

1263
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,589
The point is: God's inside you,

1264
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,239
so He helps you dump!

1265
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,630
God loves your bowels.

1266
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:16,835
Pass the joint.

1267
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,479
Check this shit out:

1268
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:26,399
"Pinhead is to skinhead,
as teeny is to weenie."

1269
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,676
Get my drift?

1270
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,473
Out of the way.

1271
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:44,148
Know the one about the guy
falling off a skyscraper?

1272
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,312
On the way down he says to himself:

1273
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:51,871
"So far so good...
so far so good..."

1274
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,510
I heard it with a rabbi.

1275
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,152
Like us in the projects.
So far so good,

1276
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,079
but how will we land?

1277
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,871
I feel like an ant
lost in intergalactic space.

1278
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,709
Watch, I'll switch off
the Eiffel Tower.

1279
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,710
That only works in movies.

1280
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,199
Mothafucka!

1281
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,588
You in a movie?

1282
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,478
In a porn flick
with your mother!

1283
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,312
Look who's talking!

1284
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:30,677
Yours sticks carrots up her ass!

1285
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,676
You're the carrot!

1286
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,390
THE WORLD lS YOURS

1287
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,558
THE WORLD lS OURS

1288
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:10,515
How did they get
the car in the gym?

1289
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,114
Search me...Ask God!

1290
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,997
Very funny.

1291
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,152
Look at those sheep in the system.

1292
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:31,110
They look cute
in their fancy leather jackets.

1293
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,838
But they're scumbags.

1294
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,390
They ride escalators,
carried by the system.

1295
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,190
They vote far right,
but aren't racists.

1296
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,397
They can't move without escalators.

1297
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,118
The worst!

1298
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,319
Racist!

1299
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,712
WAR IN BOSNlA

1300
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,756
ABDEL lCHAHA DlES

1301
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,153
Where's Vinz?

1302
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,791
Mothafucka!

1303
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,390
What?

1304
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,674
Dumb fuck!

1305
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,638
What did I do?

1306
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,716
Why hit me?

1307
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,879
What did I do?

1308
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,472
What'd I do, asshole?

1309
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,119
You suck big time!

1310
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,793
So what'd I do?

1311
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,076
Help me, Sayid! Please.

1312
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,879
Help you what?
What'd I do?

1313
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,268
Abdel's dead now!

1314
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,158
He's sick of your shit!

1315
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,389
What shit?

1316
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,551
What the fuck I do?

1317
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,989
You wanna kill a pig,
go right ahead.

1318
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,038
But you're on your own.

1319
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,918
We're outta here.

1320
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,273
Get lost.

1321
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,318
Both of you!

1322
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,440
I don't need you!

1323
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,592
I know who I am
and where I come from!

1324
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,115
So go home and shut up!

1325
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,589
Fuck your mother!

1326
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,194
Don't bug me, Sayid.

1327
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,918
Think we should've...

1328
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,674
Just what we need!

1329
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:01,955
A nigger!

1330
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,432
You're the fucker
who dissed us from the roof!

1331
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,670
The gang banger from the roof?

1332
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,400
Let's see you fight!

1333
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,353
Hold him!

1334
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,468
Come back!

1335
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,278
You fuckin' asshole!

1336
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,429
I done nothing!

1337
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,192
Faster than a speeding bullet?

1338
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,555
I done nothing!

1339
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,434
Check it out!

1340
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,188
Whadda you say?

1341
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,870
Get the fuck in there!

1342
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,919
Whatcha gonna do?

1343
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,872
You think I'm all talk?

1344
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,951
I'm all talk?

1345
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:08,636
Watch!
Don't try and stop me!

1346
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,150
- Vinz, don't do it!
- Let him!

1347
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,958
Do your good deed!

1348
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:16,669
Shut up!

1349
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,759
There are good cops.

1350
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,798
But the only good skinhead
is a dead one!

1351
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,713
Shoot him.

1352
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:27,077
We took your shit all day.
Fuckin' shoot him!

1353
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,954
You got the piece.

1354
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,028
Shoot!

1355
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,111
Shoot!

1356
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:43,039
Fuck his mother!

1357
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,435
Shoot!

1358
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,757
Abdel's dead!
Get even, for fuck's sake!

1359
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,638
Do it for Abdel!

1360
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,675
Shoot!

1361
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,551
Get outta here!

1362
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,799
See ya tomorrow.

1363
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,674
Take it.

1364
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,352
Gonna sing a love song?

1365
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,839
Go home, loser.

1366
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,912
Let's go, Vinz.

1367
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,473
Later, Hubert.

1368
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,151
Hear the one about the nun?

1369
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,709
This drunk guy comes out of a bar,

1370
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:13,236
and walks up to a nun
in this big black cape.

1371
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,870
Wham! He slugs her
in her teeth. She goes down

1372
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,600
and he keeps on pounding her.

1373
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,430
After about 5 minutes he stops,

1374
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,109
Iooks at her and says:

1375
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,191
"You're not so tough, Batman!"

1376
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,476
That's a killer!

1377
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,756
He thought the nun was Batman!

1378
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,070
I heard it with a rabbi.

1379
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,035
Over here, you!

1380
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,759
What's the matter?

1381
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,548
I know you!

1382
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,593
You were on the roof!

1383
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,353
What're you doin'?

1384
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,877
Got a problem, you fuck?

1385
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,271
Scared without your pals?

1386
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,593
Not so tough now!

1387
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,955
Look at him!

1388
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,150
It's about a society falling...

1389
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:40,359
On the way down
it keeps telling itself:

1390
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,392
"So far so good...

1391
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,958
"so far so good...

1392
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,916
"so far so good..."

1393
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,271
How you fall doesn't matter.

1394
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,392
It's how you land!

1395
