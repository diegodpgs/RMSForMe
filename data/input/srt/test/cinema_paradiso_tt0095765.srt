6
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes, Salvatore. Salvatore De Vita.

7
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,700
What do you mean you don’t know him?

8
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,400
Yes, that’s it. I’m his mother.

9
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,100
I’m calling from Sicily, the whole blessed day.

10
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,600
I see, not there.

11
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,500
Then please, can you tell me--

12
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,600
656-220-56.

13
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Thank you. Good-bye.

14
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,800
Mama, it’s useless to call.

15
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,800
He’s a busy man, could be anywhere.

16
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,000
He won’t remember anymore.

17
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,400
Come on, let it go.

18
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,400
He hasn’t been here in 30 years.

19
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,200
You know how he is.

20
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,600
He’ll remember.

21
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,900
I’m sure he’ll remember. I know him better than
you.

22
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,700
If he finds out later we didn’t tell him, he’ll be
angry.

23
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,700
I’d like to talk to Mr. Salvatore De Vita.

24
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,300
I’m his mother.

25
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,300
Salvatore...

26
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,500
what time is it?

27
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,000
Very late.

28
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,400
I’m sorry. There was no way to let you know.

29
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,200
Go back to sleep.

30
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,300
Your mother called.

31
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,500
She took me for someone else.

32
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,600
What’d you tell her?

33
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,700
I played along. I didn’t want to disappoint her.

34
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,800
We had a long talk.

35
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,400
She said you haven’t visited her in 30 years.

36
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,600
When she wants to see you, she comes to Rome.

37
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,400
She called just to say that?

38
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,500
No.

39
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,800
She said someone’s died--someone named Alfredo.

40
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,100
The funeral is tomorrow.

41
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,100
Who is he, a relative?

42
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
No. Go to sleep.

43
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,100
The boy will be my death. How can I say Mass?

44
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,600
Lord God, we ask you to be pleased with the
sacrifice we offer you with humble and contrite heart.

45
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:39,500
Cleanse...

46
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,700
Toto!

47
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Cleanse me from my sin.

48
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,300
Better late than never.

49
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,900
How often must I say it? Without the bell, I lose
my place.

50
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,200
Always sleeping. What do you do at night, eat?

51
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,600
Father, at my house we don’t even eat at noon.

52
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,200
The veterinarian says so. That’s why I’m tired.

53
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,100
I know why you’re tired. Don’t think I don’t.

54
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,600
Now run along home. I’ve something to do.

55
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,700
- Can I come?- No, you cannot.

56
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,600
- Yes, yes!- Toto, out!

57
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,800
I want to! I want to!

58
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
Alfredo.

59
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,600
Alfredo!

60
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,700
Yes!

61
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
You can start.

62
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,700
Here we go again.

63
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
The frame!

64
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,300
Pepe, one day we’ll have it all.

65
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,900
We’ll go away together--

66
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,100
live the easy life...

67
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,700
where no one knows us.

68
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,900
Forget it.

69
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,800
You don’t love me anymore.

70
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Never!

71
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,100
One pair, two pairs!

72
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,200
100 lire! Real nylon!

73
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
You mustn’t come here.

74
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,400
I told you and told you--like talking to a wall.

75
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,800
If the film catches fire...

76
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,900
little as you are, you’ll go up-- boom!

77
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,100
"And turn into a chunk of charcoal."

78
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,600
Like to wag your tongue, eh?

79
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
One day, I’ll cut it off.

80
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,300
Like that.

81
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,000
Can I have it?

82
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,500
Come on, can I have it?

83
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,100
- Well, can l?- No!

84
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
Deaf as a post!

85
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,700
I have to splice it back before I return the film.

86
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,300
What a pest you are!

87
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,200
Why didn’t you splice these when you gave the films
back?

88
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,700
Sometimes I can’t find the right place, so they
stay here.

89
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
Anyway, they kiss too much.

90
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,800
Then I can have them.

91
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,300
No. Now look, come here.

92
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,500
Before I kick your fanny, I’ll make you a deal.

93
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,500
All those are yours--a present.

94
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,000
Thanks.

95
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,400
But one, you keep out of here, and two, they stay
with me. Got it?

96
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,800
All right.

97
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,500
Right. Then we agree. Now scram.

98
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,700
What kind of a deal is that?

99
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,600
If they’re mine, how come you keep them?

100
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,300
Don’t come back, or I’ll thrash you!

101
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,100
"Shoot first, think later."

102
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,400
"This is no job for weaklings, traitorous dog."

103
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,300
"Hey, you! Dirty swine, hands off that gold!"

104
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,600
"Blackhearted pig, stay away from me...

105
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,200
or I’ll smash your face in."

106
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,700
Mama, the war’s over, but...why doesn’t Papa come
back?

107
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,300
He’ll come back, you’ll see. One of these days.

108
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,300
I don’t remember him.

109
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,900
Where’s Russia?

110
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,600
It takes years to get there and years to come back.

111
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,900
Go to bed. It’s late.

112
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,100
You can hoodwink your mother, but not me!

113
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Get your diploma and join the police! Lazybones!

114
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,900
Good-for-nothing! Get in there and study!

115
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,800
Well? How much is 5 times 5?

116
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
30.

117
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
Silence!

118
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,300
Table of 5’s, dimwit.

119
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,800
1 times 5 is 5...

120
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,700
2 times 5 is 10...

121
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,400
3 times 5 is 15...

122
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,600
4 times 5 is 20...

123
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
5 times 5?

124
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
40.

125
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,800
Silence!

126
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,800
Boccia...

127
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
25.

128
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,700
Learn your tables, or you’ll never get a job.

129
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,700
For the last time...

130
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,800
what is 5 times 5?

131
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Christmas!

132
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,300
I paid to get in. l’m seeing the movie.

133
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,000
Get down from there, you devil.

134
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,000
Go back to your seat.

135
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,300
Worse than rabbits. They’re all over the place.

136
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,300
Little monsters.

137
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,200
I’m off to Oregon.

138
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Wait for me at my ranch.

139
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,600
Wait for a dead man?

140
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,300
A star-studded cast...

141
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,100
featuring John Wayne...

142
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,300
Claire Trevor--

143
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,300
Hello, everyone!

144
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,100
- Can’t I say hello?- Double feature today.

145
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,200
So? I’m here to sleep.

146
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,200
- What’s your smoke?- Americans.

147
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,700
Cut the news, Alfredo!

148
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,300
The men and women who fought in secret--

149
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
brave guerrillas, reunited in Rome...

150
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,800
for the first Resistance Rally.

151
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,800
What does it say?

152
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,000
I’m illiterate.

153
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,300
You, too?

154
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,300
Twelve hours of blood and sweat...

155
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,600
to bring home barely enough to keep from starving.

156
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,100
Yet their nets...

157
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,600
when they pulled them up, were full.

158
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
I knew it!

159
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,200
Twenty years I’ve gone to movies and never saw a
kiss.

160
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
And when will we?

161
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,400
Kiss my ass!

162
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,500
- Don Vincenzo.- You and you, to work.

163
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,600
What about me?

164
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,300
Go get a job from Stalin.

165
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,900
His day will come, even here. You watch.

166
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
I always get left out.

167
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,300
Good movie. The kid really acted well.

168
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,200
Too bad he was so unlucky.

169
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,400
What a jackass to buy that boat.

170
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,100
Idiot, you didn’t get it at all.

171
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,300
Right, boys, you work from dawn to dusk.

172
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,300
And don’t ask how much it pays.

173
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,600
Mama.

174
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,800
I waited all day. You got milk?

175
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,600
No.

176
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,700
The money?

177
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,200
Stolen.

178
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,100
You spent it on movies?

179
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,000
Movies, always movies!

180
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
Signora Maria, wait.

181
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,600
Leave him alone. Go easy.

182
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,900
And you, why do you tell lies?

183
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,900
You know you got in free.

184
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,900
Tell your mother.

185
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,300
Maybe he lost the money inside.

186
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,900
- How much?- 50 lire.

187
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,000
What’d you find tonight, under the seats?

188
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,300
A comb.

189
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,900
Two shoe lifts.

190
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,700
- Can of tobacco--- And?

191
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,700
50 lire.

192
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,800
See?

193
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,200
Thank you, Alfredo.

194
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,500
- Good-bye.- Bye.

195
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,100
See you.

196
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,400
I understood right away.

197
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,400
The square is mine! It’s my square!

198
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
It’s midnight. Midnight!

199
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,700
Out! Shoo! I have to close the square.

200
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,500
Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

201
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,000
Going, it’s all downhill and all the saints help
out.

202
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,600
But coming back, the saints just watch.

203
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
If that’s God’s will.

204
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
See you tonight.

205
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,000
What’s wrong?

206
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,700
Your foot this time.

207
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,200
Always something. What can we do?

208
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Alfredo, did you know my father?

209
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,200
What a question. And how I knew him.

210
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,000
Tall, thin, jolly, with a nice moustache like me.

211
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,800
Always smiling. A lot like Clark Gable.

212
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,700
Now that I’m older and go to fifth grade...

213
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,900
I don’t say I should come in the booth...

214
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,300
but can’t we at least be friends?

215
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,300
"I choose my friends for looks, my enemies for
intelligence."

216
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,700
You’re too foxy to be my friend.

217
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,500
I always tell my children...

218
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,800
"Be careful how you choose your friends."

219
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,600
You haven’t got any children.

220
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,000
When I do, I’ll tell them.

221
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,100
Don’t cry, don’t cry. It’s all right.

222
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,000
The fire’s out. It’s over. I’m here.

223
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,900
What happened?

224
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Monster!

225
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,900
Your little sister could’ve burned to death.

226
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,300
And all your fault!

227
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,600
I told you not to keep your film under the bed by
the fire pan.

228
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Even the photographs burned!

229
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,500
Nearly set fire to the house.

230
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,600
You and your stupid movies!

231
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,900
Aren’t you ashamed at your age to play with a boy?

232
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,400
Why look at me? What did I do?

233
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,400
Who gave him the film?

234
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,500
Don’t do it again. He goes crazy. Crazy!

235
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,500
All I hear is movies, Alfredo.

236
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,000
Alfredo, movies!

237
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,100
Swear you won’t let him in again. Swear it!

238
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,400
You have my word.

239
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,200
God grant me this.

240
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,800
Send your father home to whip you!

241
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,800
Papa won’t come back, and I know why.

242
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,300
He’s dead.

243
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,900
That’s not true.

244
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,600
You’ll see, he’ll come back.

245
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
They smoke like chimneys.

246
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,400
No. Go buy a ticket.

247
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,900
No!

248
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,400
What was that?

249
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,000
I’ll make mincemeat of you! You’ll reckon with me!

250
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,600
Signora Anna!

251
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Alfredo.

252
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,300
Don’t blame me. Your wife told me to bring your
lunch.

253
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,800
I told my mother you didn’t give me the film.

254
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,200
It wasn’t your fault.

255
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,200
I thought it was a joke about film catching fire.

256
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,300
I just wanted to tell you. Now I’ll go.

257
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,900
Toto, come here.

258
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,500
Come on, come sit down.

259
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,500
Now listen. I got into this business at age ten.

260
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,300
Back then, we didn’t have fancy machines.

261
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,300
Movies were silent.

262
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,900
You turned the projector by hand...

263
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,500
with a crank.

264
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,700
The whole livelong day!

265
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,600
And it was hard, that damn crank.

266
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,600
If you got tired and slowed down a bit...

267
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,500
like a shot, whoom, everything burned.

268
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,000
So why not teach me?

269
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,200
Now that there’s no crank and it’s dead easy.

270
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,200
Because I don’t want to.

271
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,000
It’s no kind of job for you.

272
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,300
You’re like a slave...

273
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,400
and always alone.

274
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,900
You see a film 100 times.
You’ve nothing else to do.

275
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,000
You talk to Garbo and Tyrone Power like a
loony bird.

276
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
You work like a burro.

277
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Even holidays--Easter, Christmas.

278
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,900
You only get Good Friday off.

279
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,600
And if they hadn’t stuck Christ on a cross...

280
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,100
we’d even work then.

281
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,900
So why don’t you change jobs?

282
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,000
Because I’m a nitwit.

283
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,800
Who else around here could run a projector?

284
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,600
Nobody. It takes an imbecile like me.

285
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,300
And I never had any luck.

286
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,800
So! Want to be a stick-in-the-mud like me? How
about it?

287
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,100
Attaboy, Toto.

288
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,500
I only tell you for your own good.

289
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,000
Cooped up here. Suffocate in summer, freeze to
death in winter.

290
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Breathing fumes.

291
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
And you earn chicken feed.

292
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,400
Don’t you like anything about it?

293
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,400
Oh, it grows on you.

294
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,300
Sometimes you listen...

295
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,700
and the house is full of people...

296
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,000
giggling and laughing.

297
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,500
Then you’re happy too.

298
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,300
It makes you feel good to hear them.

299
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,100
Like you’re the one who made them laugh--

300
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,500
who made them forget their troubles.

301
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,400
That part I like.

302
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,900
I might as well speak Greek! What’re you up to?

303
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,600
Pretend to listen, then play the clown!

304
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,000
Your mother’s right! You’re a scatterbrain!

305
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,500
How’d the rascal do it? He learned by watching.

306
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,300
I’m telling the manager not to let you in!

307
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,200
And I’ll see Father Adelfio! No more altar boy!
Finished!

308
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,300
Alfredo!

309
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,800
Up yours!

310
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,200
I got it! I won! I won the football lottery!

311
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,100
The Neapolitan won the lottery!

312
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,700
Hey, Ciccio from Naples won the lottery!

313
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,900
Always the northerners who hit it lucky.

314
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,800
The square is mine! All mine!

315
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,700
Hold still! Horseflies bothering you?

316
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,300
You got a lice factory up here.

317
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,000
Beat it.

318
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,200
What’re you after? A smack?

319
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,100
Get out of here.

320
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,200
A merchant owns two stores.

321
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,300
In one, he sells fruit.

322
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,900
Be seated.

323
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Professor...

324
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,000
the auditors taking the exam for the grade school
diploma.

325
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,900
Silence!

326
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,700
Rotten little stinker.

327
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,000
- Toto, help me.- Silence!

328
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,800
I can’t do this damn thing.

329
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Toto!

330
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,200
O. K.

331
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,700
Francesco Messana...

332
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,900
you’re under arrest.

333
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,200
Good riddance!

334
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Kiss my ass! Pencil pusher!

335
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,800
Right here is where it can catch fire.

336
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,900
If it does, cut here and here, or the whole reel
will burn. Got it?

337
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,200
Yes. Alfredo.

338
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,300
Never. We’ll never have that here.

339
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,900
Which side is the gelatin on?

340
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,000
It tastes good.

341
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,000
Shipping invoice for the film. Always keep them.

342
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,900
I will, Alfredo.

343
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,800
Don’t ever forget.

344
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,400
This is for you. Today you load the reels yourself.

345
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,800
- It’s so high!- Now you can run it alone.

346
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,200
Hold it.

347
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,100
- What a build!- My turn!

348
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,000
Say good-bye to Peppino. He’s leaving for Germany.

349
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,500
Why don’t you say good-bye?

350
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,100
My father says he’s a communist.

351
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,100
God keep you, Mama.

352
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,500
Will he really find work in Germany?

353
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,700
You never know. Like playing the lottery...

354
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,700
you live on hope.

355
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,000
Screw this country!

356
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,500
Go work in Germany, you and your Stalin.

357
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,500
Good-bye, Mama.

358
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,400
Good-bye, Peppino! Come back soon!

359
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,600
We’ll see you.

360
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,000
Good-bye!

361
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,000
Lucky thing Germany is closer than Russia.

362
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,700
After six years, the return of spring fashion.

363
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,400
Fresh and breezy...

364
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,200
unlike the pompous styles of wartime.

365
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,300
I’ll make mincemeat of you!

366
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,300
"You’ll reckon with me!"

367
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,600
Another sad page...

368
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,600
in the tragedy of our men in Russia.

369
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,000
The Defense Ministry...

370
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,200
has released a new list of Italian dead...

371
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,100
until now considered missing.

372
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,000
The names will be posted by local military
authorities.

373
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,100
Families concerned will be notified.

374
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,400
However, we don’t know where he’s buried.

375
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,800
Here’s the pension form. Sign it, please.

376
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,200
Out! Go home! We can’t have another show!

377
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,700
It’s late. Be reasonable. We can’t show it again!

378
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,700
Some people sat through it twice!

379
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,400
We’ve been waiting for an hour!

380
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,500
Tomorrow we’ll have another movie.

381
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:32,100
A western. Word of Honor! Go home to bed.

382
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,800
They’ll wreck the Paradiso! All hell will break
loose!

383
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,300
Alfredo, let us in!

384
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,600
What can I do?

385
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,100
I’ve been waiting for3 hours!

386
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,900
"A mob doesn’t think.

387
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,200
It has a mind of its own."

388
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,500
Spencer Tracy said that in "Fury."

389
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,700
Well, what do you say?

390
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,500
Shall we let the poor devils see their film?

391
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,800
Fantastic. But how?

392
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:21,000
"If you have no faith in me, have faith in what you
see."

393
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,300
Now get your fanny off that stool.

394
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,700
Get ready.

395
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,100
Abracadabra...

396
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,600
and we pass through walls.

397
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,800
Go look out the window.

398
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,400
Alfredo, it’s beautiful.

399
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,800
Over there! It’s the movie!

400
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,700
Bravo, Alfredo.

401
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,700
Thank you, Alfredo!

402
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,100
What’s going on?

403
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,000
It’s a movie!

404
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
To hell with you.

405
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,600
There’s no sound!

406
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,500
Shall we make them happy?

407
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,500
Want to go down?

408
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,100
Go on.

409
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
- Look.- Good Lord.

410
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,800
And Nunzio, half price.

411
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,200
Have to buy tickets, folks.

412
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,900
Reduced rates.

413
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Up yours! The square belongs to everyone!

414
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,400
Oh, no!

415
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,000
The square is mine! Don’t joke about that! It makes
me mad!

416
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,400
Alfredo!

417
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,000
Alfredo! No! Alfredo!

418
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:41,500
Alfredo, Alfredo. Help! Help!

419
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,200
Alfredo, Alfredo!

420
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,900
Help!

421
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,000
Poor Alfredo. What a shame.

422
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,500
All burned!

423
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,600
It all burned down!

424
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,900
What do we do now?

425
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,800
We have no more entertainment. Nothing.

426
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,100
Where’ll we get the money to rebuild?

427
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,100
Take a look at Ciccio. So spiffy, you’d hardly know
him.

428
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,700
Who has that kind of money?

429
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,800
The new Cinema Paradiso!

430
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,300
Come in, come in.

431
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,600
This theater is for you!

432
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,700
He’s just a boy. What about labor laws?

433
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,600
I got the license through connections.

434
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,000
Don’t ask me how their minds work.

435
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:00,800
Officially, I’m the projectionist, but the money
goes to Toto.

436
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,100
Stay on your toes, Toto. No sleeping.

437
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,300
We’ve had enough disasters.

438
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,200
Do what poor Alfredo taught you. And God bless you.

439
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,200
Thank you, Father.

440
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,600
What is this, a funeral? Life goes on! Gaiety!
Music!

441
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,600
Get a load of that!

442
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,100
Our Father--

443
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,100
My God, they’re kissing!

444
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,700
I won’t watch pornography.

445
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,600
Three cheers for Ciccio!

446
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Any room for me in this new paradise?

447
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,500
Alfredo!

448
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,900
Bring him home after you close.

449
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,600
I’m going, Alfredo.

450
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,700
It’s great you came.

451
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,800
How’re things at school?

452
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,400
Fine, but now that I’m working...

453
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,600
maybe I won’t go anymore.

454
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,600
No. No, Toto.

455
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,400
Don’t do that.

456
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,000
You’ll end up with egg on your face.

457
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,800
Why? What does that mean?

458
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,800
It means...

459
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:56,500
that this isn’t your real work.

460
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,400
Right now the Paradiso needs you...

461
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,500
and you need the Paradiso...

462
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,000
but it’s a stopgap.

463
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
One day you’ll go on...to other things.

464
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,200
Things...

465
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,800
that are more important.

466
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,900
Definitely more important.

467
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,900
I know. Now that I’ve lost my sight...

468
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,900
I see better.

469
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,700
Things I never saw before.

470
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,200
All thanks to you, who saved my life.

471
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,300
I won’t forget it.

472
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,400
And don’t look like that.

473
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,000
I’m not senile yet. Want proof?

474
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,500
- Yes.- Well, let’s see.

475
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,500
For example...

476
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,900
right now, the film’s out of focus.

477
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,500
Go check.

478
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,700
You’re right, it’s out of focus.

479
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,900
How’d you know?

480
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,900
Too hard to explain.

481
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
What’s the idea? Watch the screen. Animals,
rapists!

482
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,000
Look, don’t touch.

483
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,700
I told you... It doesn’t catch fire.

484
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,300
Progress always comes too late.

485
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,000
Workers of the world--

486
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,200
She’s new.

487
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,900
Not bad.

488
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,400
Approachable.

489
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,600
Father’s the bank manager. Pride, pomp and
circumstance.

490
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,400
Jerks off with his shirt, not to get his hand
dirty.

491
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,900
Go, man, go!

492
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,700
- Excuse me.- Yes?

493
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,200
You dropped this.

494
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,800
Oh, thanks.

495
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,100
I didn’t even notice.

496
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,300
My name’s Salvatore. What’s yours?

497
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,800
Elena. My name’s Elena.

498
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,800
I wanted to tell you, well, the other day at the
station--

499
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,400
The small projector? Your footage?

500
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,200
What do you see?

501
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,000
Slaughterhouse workers killing a heifer.

502
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:39,400
Blood all over the floor, like a lake.

503
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,200
Over the lake comes another heifer...

504
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,500
about to die.

505
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Why’d you stop? What do we see?

506
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,400
Nothing. We don’t see anything. It’s all fuzzy.

507
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,800
A woman.

508
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,200
It’s a woman.

509
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,300
Yes, a girl I saw at the station.

510
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,600
What’s she like?

511
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,600
She’s very nice.

512
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,000
My age, slim, long hair, brown.

513
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,200
Big eyes, very blue, honest and direct.

514
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,500
A little beauty mark on her lip.

515
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,100
Very small. You only see it up close.

516
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:37,500
When she smiles, you feel like--l don’t know.

517
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:42,900
Love.

518
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,200
I know how it is...The blue-eyed ones are the
worst.

519
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:56,300
No matter what you do, they’ll never be your
friends.

520
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,800
Nothing for it.

521
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,800
The bigger the man, the deeper his imprint.

522
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:07,400
And if he loves, he suffers, knowing it’s a
dead-end street.

523
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,100
That’s nice, what you just said.

524
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,600
But sad.

525
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:17,600
I didn’t say it. It was John Wayne in "The Shepherd
of the Hills."

526
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,800
You old pirate.

527
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,500
- Hello, Elena.- Hello.

528
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,500
Why’re you running?

529
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,400
Because...

530
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,700
I wanted to tell you...

531
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,900
you remember when we--

532
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,400
Nice day, isn’t it?

533
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,800
Yes, really nice.

534
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,800
Excuse me, I have to go. Bye.

535
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,400
What a jerk. What a jerk!

536
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,400
"Nice day, isn’t it?"

537
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,600
Of all the assholes!

538
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,200
I told you so.

539
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,600
You thought I was joking.

540
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:47,100
But take it from me, the blue-eyed ones are the
worst.

541
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,700
But why? There must be a way to make her
understand.

542
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,700
Don’t even try. With feelings, there’s nothing to
understand...

543
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,700
and no way to explain.

544
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,200
Oh, you made the world!

545
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,300
With due respect to the Lord...

546
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,600
who made the world in 2, 3 days...

547
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,300
I’d have taken a bit longer...

548
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,500
but in all modesty, I would’ve done it better.

549
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,700
Like I said...you always have an answer.

550
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:21,500
Just for you, Toto, I’ll tell you a story.

551
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,500
Let’s sit down a minute.

552
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,000
Misery of miseries.

553
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,400
Once...

554
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,900
a king gave a feast...

555
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,700
for the loveliest princesses in the realm.

556
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:41,100
Now, a soldier who was standing guard...

557
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,700
saw the king’s daughter go by.

558
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,400
She was the most beautiful of all...

559
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,800
and he instantly fell in love.

560
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,700
But what is a simple soldier...

561
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,400
next to the daughter of a king?

562
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Well, at last he succeeded in meeting her...

563
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,200
and he told her he could no longer live without
her.

564
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:10,200
The princess was so taken by the depth of his
feeling...

565
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,600
that she said to the soldier...

566
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,800
"If you can wait...

567
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,500
for 100 days and 100 nights under my balcony...

568
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:25,000
at the end of it, I shall be yours."

569
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:31,300
With that, the soldier went and waited one day...

570
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,300
two days, then ten, then twenty.

571
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,700
Each evening the princess looked out...

572
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,000
and he never moved!

573
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,800
In rain, in wind, in snow, he was always there.

574
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,300
Birds shat on his head, bees stung him...

575
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,300
but he didn’t budge.

576
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,800
At the end...

577
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,000
of 90 days...

578
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,600
he had become...

579
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,300
all dry, all white.

580
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,100
Tears streamed from his eyes.

581
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,500
He couldn’t hold them back.

582
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,800
He didn’t even have the strength to sleep.

583
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:21,200
And all that time, the princess watched him.

584
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,800
At long last, it was the 99th night...

585
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and the soldier stood up, took his chair...

586
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,500
and left.

587
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,500
What? At the end?

588
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,900
At the very end.

589
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,400
And don’t ask what it means. I don’t know.

590
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,500
If you understand it, you tell me.

591
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,400
Only one print?

592
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,900
You know I need two. One for the Paradiso...

593
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
one for the next town.

594
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:16,200
You promised. I put up posters, made commitments!

595
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,500
If you screw me, watch out!

596
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,700
One print for two theaters!

597
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,500
You’ll pay for this!

598
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,900
I’m from Naples, and you will see it and die!

599
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,600
We see the crib. The child’s asleep.

600
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,100
"Do something!"

601
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,600
The lawyer told me. Now I know.

602
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:41,100
"The lawyer told me. Now I know."

603
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:46,700
And everyone must know. Yes, everyone must know.

604
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,600
"Everyone must know."

605
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,600
You believe me?

606
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,300
"You believe me?"

607
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,600
Yes, I believe you.

608
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,000
"Yes, I believe you."

609
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,900
Our own home. How I’ve dreamed of it.

610
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,900
- "Our own home."- "How I’ve dreamed of it."

611
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,600
Tonino!

612
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,800
Mama.

613
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,300
Mama!

614
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
The End.

615
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:06,300
I don’t like it. I don’t like it.

616
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,700
I cut the end credits to go faster.

617
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,300
Hurry back with part one. I’ll show a newsreel.

618
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,000
I’ll call the police. Take him.

619
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,400
Just a minute. Just a minute!

620
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,400
Give me part two. Here’s part one.

621
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,000
Hurry, the house is packed.

622
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:57,400
Come on, slowpoke. Get her rolling!

623
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,200
Bunch of animals. Quiet!

624
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,100
Come on, Toto, they’ll explode!

625
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,300
It’s been a half hour!

626
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,000
What can I do?

627
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,900
Where is that son of a jackass? I’ll be ruined.

628
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:50,100
Calm down, calm down.

629
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,500
I’ll have you know, just to see this movie...

630
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,600
I left my wife homesick in bed...

631
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,100
and I haven’t seen a thing.

632
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,500
If it’s not here in ten minutes, give us back our
money.

633
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,900
Me and everyone here!

634
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,700
Or with this, I’ll wreck the place!

635
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,700
Calm down! Calm down and let me talk.

636
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,900
Tell you what. I’ll show part one another time.

637
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,700
Quiet, quiet!

638
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,900
I’ve seen the whole movie. I’ll tell you the plot.

639
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,700
Alfredo, what is it?

640
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,100
I can’t. The Host is on the altar.

641
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,500
Father, I need you urgently...

642
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,300
because I have doubts...

643
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,600
terrible doubts tormenting my soul.

644
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,500
Your soul.

645
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,700
Father, I’ve sinned.

646
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,900
- Do that after.- But who--

647
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,900
Stay there. Don’t move.

648
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,500
Just act normal. It’s Salvatore.

649
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,200
How’d you get here?

650
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,600
Alfredo, that’s a terrible thing to say.

651
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,700
I know.

652
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,700
But take the miracle of the loaves and fishes.

653
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,200
What about it?

654
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:42,100
I always wonder...how is it possible?

655
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,600
I had to talk to you.

656
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,000
You’re beautiful, Elena.

657
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,600
That’s what I wanted to tell you.

658
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:03,800
When we meet, I can’t say anything right...

659
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
because you give me the shivers.

660
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:11,800
I don’t know what others do in these cases.

661
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,200
It’s my first time.

662
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,200
But I’m in love with you.

663
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,700
Father, I have sinned.

664
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,900
I absolve you, in the name of the Father...

665
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,400
Son and Holy Ghost.

666
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,400
Go in peace.

667
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,600
When you laugh, you’re even prettier.

668
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,700
Salvatore, you’re very sweet, and I like you very
much...

669
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,400
but I don’t love you.

670
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,300
I don’t care. I’ll wait.

671
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,800
What?

672
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,200
For you to fall in love with me.

673
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,200
Now listen.

674
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,700
Every night after work, I’ll come stand outside
your house.

675
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,800
And I’ll wait. Every night.

676
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,800
When you change your mind, open your window.

677
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,200
That’s all. I’ll understand.

678
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,700
You understand now?

679
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:21,000
Yes, finally, I see the light.

680
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,900
Next time, don’t talk heresy.

681
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,600
You survived the theater fire,

682
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,100
but from the Eternal Fire--that is, Eternal Fire--

683
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,800
no one can save you.

684
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:21,400
Fifteen seconds to the new year!

685
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:25,600
14, 13, 12

686
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:29,700
11, 10, 9, 8...

687
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:44,800
Salvatore.

688
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,800
Oh, great. Never been driven, he said.

689
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,300
How’ll we get home?

690
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,700
Stop!

691
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,200
Oh, God, it’s my father.

692
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,600
Hello, Mr. Mendola.

693
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,200
- Hello.- Hello.

694
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,800
Play at an open-air theater.

695
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,000
Standing room only!

696
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,600
Come on in. The show just started.

697
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,600
Have your tickets ready.

698
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,300
Salvatore, my love.

699
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:43,000
A whole summer with my family, far from you,

700
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,400
my days here go on forever.

701
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,900
I see your name everywhere in a book, a crossword
puzzle...

702
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:51,400
a newspaper.

703
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,900
You’re always before my eyes.

704
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,100
Today, alas, I have bad news.

705
01:30:56,300 --> 01:31:00,400
In October we move to Palermo, where I’ll go to
university.

706
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,000
So we won’t see each other every day.

707
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:06,700
But don’t worry, whenever I can get away...

708
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:10,100
I’ll come to you at the Paradiso.

709
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:14,000
I’m blind!

710
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:34,600
By God’s might, by man’s running! Rise up!

711
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,600
When will this rotten summer end?

712
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,700
In a film, it’d already be over.

713
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Fade-out: cut to storm. Wouldn’t that be great?

714
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,600
Tell them I am Odyssey!

715
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,600
Elena--But when?

716
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,400
Today.

717
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,700
You can’t imagine the excuses I made up to come
here.

718
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,200
I’m doing my military service in Rome. I leave
Friday.

719
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,600
I’ll come to say good-bye at the Paradiso.

720
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:23,300
I’ll arrive Thursday, by 5 p.m. bus.

721
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:33,800
Maybe the army made a mistake. Anyway, Rome is
beautiful.

722
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:38,100
Load the reels for tomorrow, ready for the new man.

723
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,500
Hey, cheer up.

724
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,100
I’ll wait for you. Don’t worry.

725
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,100
The job’ll still be here.

726
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:49,100
I’ll wait, you hear?

727
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,500
Don’t look so gloomy.

728
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,300
Come on! Hup!

729
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:36,400
Radioman Di Vita, 3rd Battalion, 9th Company, sir!

730
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:44,100
Transferred her father? No way! And no one knows
where?

731
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:47,400
Screw you if you won’t tell me! Asshole son of a
bitch!

732
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,300
You’re thinner.

733
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:44,100
Put you through it, eh?

734
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,600
They tell me you never go out...

735
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,400
and you never talk to anybody.

736
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:49,600
Why?

737
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,900
You know how it is.

738
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:57,200
Sooner or later the time comes...

739
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:00,500
whether you talk or don’t talk...

740
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,500
it’s the same thing.

741
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,900
So you might as well shut up.

742
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,700
It’s hot here.

743
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,600
Take me to the sea.

744
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:22,400
At a party, a lieutenant pinches this girl’s ass.

745
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:26,400
She turns around. It’s the colonel’s daughter.

746
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,300
Terrified, the lieutenant says...

747
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:33,500
"If your heart is as hard as what I just felt, I’m
a dead man."

748
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,500
You haven’t seen her?

749
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,100
No.

750
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,500
And no one knows where she is.

751
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:53,300
Probably that’s how it was meant to be.

752
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:57,800
We, each of us, have a star to follow.

753
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,800
Get out of here.

754
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,900
This land is cursed.

755
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,900
Living here day by day...

756
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:10,500
you think it’s the center of the world.

757
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:14,500
You believe nothing will ever change.

758
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:18,300
Then you leave...a year, two years.

759
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,000
When you come back, everything’s changed.

760
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,800
The thread’s broken.

761
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,700
What you came to find isn’t there.

762
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,700
What was yours is gone.

763
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,600
You have to go away for a long time...

764
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,000
many years...

765
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:40,100
before you can come back and find your people.

766
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,700
The land where you were born.

767
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,900
But now, no. It’s not possible.

768
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:48,800
Right now you’re blinder than I am.

769
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:52,800
Who said that? Gary Cooper? James Stewart? Henry
Fonda?

770
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:54,700
No, Toto.

771
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,500
Nobody said it.

772
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,200
This time it’s all me.

773
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:08,300
Life isn’t like in the movies.

774
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,600
Life...

775
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,700
is much harder.

776
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,400
Get out of here.

777
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:19,700
Go back to Rome. You’re young...

778
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:22,300
the world is yours.

779
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,200
And I’m old.

780
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,300
I don’t want to hear you talk anymore.

781
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,800
I want to hear talk about you.

782
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,200
Don’t come back.

783
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,500
Don’t think about us.

784
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:58,400
Don’t look back. Don’t write.

785
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:04,100
Don’t give in to nostalgia. Forget us all.

786
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:07,500
If you do and you come back, don’t come see me.

787
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:11,300
I won’t let you in my house. Understand?

788
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:20,200
Thank you.

789
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,700
For everything you’ve done for me.

790
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,300
Whatever you end up doing, love it.

791
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:33,500
The way you loved the projection booth...

792
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,600
when you were a little squirt.

793
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:50,400
He’s left. Toto! Good-bye!

794
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,400
Got here too late, what a shame.

795
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,900
It’s Toto. I knew it.

796
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,900
See how nice the house is?

797
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:44,100
We had it all redone, all thanks to you.

798
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:48,000
I have a surprise for you. Come.

799
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:50,700
Are you tired?

800
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:53,700
You have time to rest before the funeral.

801
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:57,400
No, Mama, it’s only an hour by plane.

802
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,400
Don’t tell me that after all these years.

803
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:05,600
Come. I put everything in here. All your things.

804
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:56,000
He must be glad you came, Toto.

805
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,900
He always talked about you. Always.

806
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,900
Right up to the end.

807
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:12,400
He really--He really loved you.

808
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,800
He left something for you.

809
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,200
Before you leave...

810
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,300
come see me.

811
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:09,700
How have you been?

812
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,600
When did you close it down?

813
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,200
Six years ago in May. Nobody came anymore.

814
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:32,300
You know better than I, Mr. Di Vita--the economy,
TV, videos.

815
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,200
The old movie business is just a memory.

816
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:41,700
The city bought the site for a parking lot.

817
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,600
They’re demolishing it Saturday. It’s too bad.

818
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:49,700
What’s this "Mr. Di Vita"?

819
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,900
You used to order me around.

820
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,800
Now that you’re a big shot, it’s a little
different.

821
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,300
But, if you insist, Toto.

822
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,000
Excuse me.

823
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:14,200
Who would’ve believed it--little Toto.

824
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:32,800
This is...what he left for you.

825
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,000
He never asked to see me?

826
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,700
No, never.

827
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:44,900
Once your mother said to him...

828
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:48,200
that if he wanted it, you’d surely come.

829
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,400
He was furious. He said, "No.

830
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:57,000
Toto must never come back to Giancaldo!"

831
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,300
He didn’t say it to be mean.

832
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,500
He was a good man.

833
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:09,700
Who knows what was going through his head.

834
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:14,000
Towards the end, he said strange things.

835
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,800
A moment before he closed his eyes...

836
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,300
he told your mother she mustn’t let you know.

837
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,300
What’re you thinking?

838
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:45,900
Just that I’ve always been afraid to come back.

839
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:53,400
And now, after all these years, I thought I was
stronger...

840
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:55,900
that I’d forgotten a lot of things.

841
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:59,500
But in fact...

842
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:02,000
I find I’m right back where I was...

843
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,800
as if I’d never been away.

844
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,800
Yet when I look around, I don’t recognize anyone.

845
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,700
And you, Mama...

846
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,900
I deserted you.

847
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,200
Ran out on you like a bandit...

848
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,400
without any explanation.

849
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,100
I never asked for any.

850
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,800
You don’t have to explain to me.

851
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,800
I always thought it was good what you did. Why harp
on it?

852
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:36,900
You were right to leave.

853
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,800
You did what you wanted to do.

854
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:46,200
When I call you, a different woman always answers.

855
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,700
But I never heard in any of their voices...

856
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,900
that they really loved you.

857
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:56,400
I would’ve known.

858
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,500
All the same, I’d have liked...

859
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:03,000
to see you settled...

860
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:05,000
loving someone.

861
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,300
But your life is there.

862
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:11,400
Here there are only ghosts.

863
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:12,900
Let go, Toto.

864
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:44,400
It’s my square. It’s mine.

865
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:17,900
Check the leader. Roll when you’re ready.

866
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:20,700
Right. And I liked your film. Terrific.

867
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:21,700
Thanks.

868
02:01:33,700 --> 02:02:08,700
