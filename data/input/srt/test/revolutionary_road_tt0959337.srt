1
00:01:55,624 --> 00:02:00,582
So, what do you do?
- I'm studying to be an actress. You?


2
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:04,538
I'm a longshoreman.
- No, I mean, really.


3
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:06,549
I mean really, too.


4
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:07,708
Although, starting next Monday,


5
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:10,090
I'm doing something
a little more glamorous.


6
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:10,634
What's that?


7
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:13,973
Night cashier at a cafeteria.


8
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:18,888
I don't mean how you make money.
I mean, what are you interested in?


9
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:22,770
Honey, if I had the answer to that one,


10
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,646
I bet I'd bore us both to death
in half an hour.


11
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:08,940
Thank God
that's over.


12
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,656
So much for the debut
of the Laurel Players.


13
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:15,991
And she was very disappointing.


14
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:27,542
Frank! Very nice, Frank!
- Thanks so much, Mrs Givings.


15
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:31,216
I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it.
You have a very talented wife.


16
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:33,510
I'll pass it along.


17
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,236
Frank!
- Hi!


18
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:51,905
She's in there.
I'm about ready for that drink.


19
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:53,865
Couple of minutes.


20
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:05,701
April? Sweetheart?


21
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:10,133
Hi.
- Hi.


22
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,968
You about ready to leave?
- Yeah. Yeah.


23
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:15,930
I've just got to get this makeup off.


24
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:26,780
Well, I guess it wasn't a triumph
or anything, was it?


25
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:34,900
I guess not. I'll be ready in a minute.
- Take your time.


26
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,827
Listen, will you do me a favour?


27
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:42,826
Milly and Shep wanted us
to go out with them after.


28
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,500
Will you say we can't? Say it's because
of the babysitter or something.


29
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:48,940
Well, the thing is,
I already said that we could.


30
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,546
I mean, I just saw them
and I said that we would.


31
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:52,750
Then would you mind going out again
and saying you were mistaken?


32
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:53,964
That should be simple enough.


33
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,838
Don't you think
that's a little bit rude, April?


34
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:58,758
Then I'll tell them myself.
- Okay. Okay. Take it easy.


35
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,930
All right? I'll tell them.


36
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,893
I mean it, baby.
You were the only person in that play.


37
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:47,720
Thank you.


38
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:52,979
We shouldn't have let you get
mixed up in the damned thing, is all.


39
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:55,270
All right.


40
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:58,857
What a bunch of amateurs. I mean,
you've studied, for Christ's sake.


41
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:00,321
Could we stop talking about it now?


42
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,880
Sure.


43
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,953
I just don't want you
feeling bad about it, that's all.


44
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,123
Because it's not worth it, you know.


45
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:11,787
It's bad enough having to live out
here amongst these people...


46
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:14,081
What'd you say?
- I said yes. All right, Frank.


47
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:19,211
Could you just stop talking about it now
before you drive me crazy, please?


48
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,177
What are you doing?


49
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:38,200
April, sweetheart,
let's talk about this, okay?


50
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:40,319
No, Frank, please don't do that.
- Come on, now.


51
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,324
Don't touch me.
- April...


52
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,944
Just leave me alone.


53
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,590
Okay. Okay.


54
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,593
It strikes me that there's a considerable
amount of bullshit going on here.


55
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,803
And there's just a few things
that I'd like to clear up. All right?


56
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:06,509
Number one, it's not my fault
that the play was lousy. Okay?


57
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,850
Number two,
it sure as hell isn't my fault


58
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:11,304
that you didn't turn out to be an actress,


59
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,729
and the sooner you get over
that little piece of soap opera,


60
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:15,022
the better off we're both going to be.


61
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:17,857
Number three,
I don't happen to fit the role


62
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:20,859
of dumb, insensitive suburban husband.


63
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,992
You've been trying to lay that crap
on me ever since we moved out here.


64
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,364
And I'm damned if I'll wear it.


65
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,100
Number four... April? April!


66
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,701
April.


67
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,331
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in the car.


68
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,130
No. I will in a minute.
Just let me stand here for a second.


69
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:41,838
God damn it!


70
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:49,014
April, can you please just get back
in the car and talk about this


71
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,555
instead of running all over Route 12?


72
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:53,261
Haven't I made it clear I don't
particularly want to talk about it?


73
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,190
Okay. I mean, Jesus,
I'm trying to be nice


74
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,226
about this thing here, for God's sake.


75
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:00,397
How kind of you.
How terribly, terribly kind of you.


76
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:01,990
Wait a minute. I don't deserve this.


77
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:03,693
You're always so wonderfully definite


78
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:06,260
on the subject of what you do
and don't deserve.


79
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:10,115
Wait a minute! Wait a goddamn... April!
Now you listen to me.


80
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,206
This is one time
you're not going to get away


81
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:14,327
with twisting everything that I say, April.


82
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,584
This just happens to be
one goddamn time


83
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:18,374
I know I'm not in the wrong here.


84
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:19,966
Christ, I wish
you'd stayed home tonight.


85
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,337
You know what you are
when you're like this, April?


86
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,844
You're sick. I really mean that.


87
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,295
You're sick! What?
- And do you know what you are?


88
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,711
You're disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?


89
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,094
You don't fool me, Frank.


90
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:30,265
Just because you've got me safely
in this little trap,


91
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:32,850
you think you can bully me into feeling
whatever you want me to feel!


92
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,110
You in a trap? You in a trap?
- Yes! Yes! Me, Frank!


93
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:39,180
Jesus Christ, don't make me laugh!
- Me!


94
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:42,062
You pathetic, self-deluded little boy.
Look at you!


95
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:45,732
Look at you and tell me, how by any
stretch of the imagination


96
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:47,991
you can call yourself a man?


97
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:51,862
Damn it!


98
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,244
Jesus Christ!


99
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:15,017
Don't look at me like that, April.
- Could we please go home now?


100
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:22,148
Fifteenth floor.


101
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:38,574
I'm going to need your help
this morning, Old Scout.


102
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:43,120
For the next few hours, you're to warn
me of Bandy's every approach


103
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,530
and you may need to shield me
from public view


104
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:49,130
in the likely event I void my stomach.


105
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,718
It's that bad.


106
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,802
Good morning, Jack.


107
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:55,213
Nothing good about it, I assure you.


108
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:19,245
<i>Of course, I knew the moment</i>
<i>you stepped off the train</i>


109
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,800
<i>what you were looking for.</i>


110
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,370
A small remodelled barn,
or a carriage house.


111
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:26,330
And I just hate to be
the one to tell you that sort of thing


112
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,954
just isn't available any more.


113
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:31,582
But I don't want you to despair.


114
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:35,253
There is one place up here
I want to show you.


115
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:39,630
Now, of course, it isn't very desirable
at this end.


116
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,095
As you can see, Crawford Road
is mostly these little cinder-blocky,


117
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,148
pick-up trucky places,
plumbers, carpenters,


118
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,393
little local people of that sort.


119
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:49,986
But eventually...


120
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:54,810
Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary
Road, which is much nicer.


121
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,783
Now, the place I want to show you


122
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,362
is a sweet little house
and a sweet little setting.


123
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,284
Simple, clean lines, good lawns,
marvellous for children.


124
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,791
It's just around this next curve.


125
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:14,875
Now, you'll see it. There.
See the little white one? Sweet, isn't it?


126
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:20,845
The perky way it sits there on
its little slope? Charming, isn't it?


127
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:24,558
Oh, yes.


128
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,158
You wanted to see me?


129
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:40,534
Came for you from Toledo this morning.
This is the third one this month.


130
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:42,371
Sorry. I thought I'd taken care of...


131
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,100
I'm not prepared to have this
conversation again, Frank.


132
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,540
You understand?
- I was literally just getting into...


133
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,044
These folks in the provinces look up
to us. We need to be efficient.


134
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,841
We can't have this
kind of back and forth, and so forth.


135
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:57,712
It's just not efficient. Am I right?
- Yes.


136
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,046
What was that about?
- Toledo.


137
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,594
Branch manager wants
a revised brochure


138
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,557
for the conference on the Knox 500.


139
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,809
"It's just not efficient. Am I right?
Am I right? Am I right?"


140
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,152
Sounds like a goodie.


141
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,647
For God's sake. I don't even know what
the Knox 500 does. Do you?


142
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:18,820
Don't insult me.


143
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:37,926
If you'll look in the inactive file
under SP 1109,


144
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:41,303
you'll find copies of all the stuff we sent
to the agency,


145
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,770
that way we can trace the thing back
to its original sources.


146
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:53,310
Listen, I hope you weren't planning
on having an early lunch.


147
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,985
No. I'm not really hungry.


148
00:14:57,114 --> 00:14:59,700
Good. I'll check on you later then.
All right?


149
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,944
Okay.
- Okay.


150
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,288
You know something, Maureen?
You're lucky you met me.


151
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:14,130
How's that?


152
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:18,630
I think I can show you the ropes,
you know.


153
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:25,130
There's a certain art to survival at Knox.
Really. Let me show you what I mean.


154
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:30,142
Waiter. Bring me the telephone,
would you? And two more martinis.


155
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,186
Wow.


156
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:42,572
Klondike 5-55-66, please.


157
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:47,829
Hello, Mrs Jorgensen?
Frank Wheeler here. Yes.


158
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,993
I just wanted to let you know
that I've had to send Maureen Grube


159
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,326
down to Visual Aids for me.


160
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,961
I'll probably need her
the rest of the afternoon. Yes.


161
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,340
You, too. Take care now.


162
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:11,640
I never even heard of Visual Aids.
- That's because it doesn't exist.


163
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:35,540
Hi, Helen. Come on in.


164
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:38,380
I can't stay a minute.


165
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,060
I just wanted to bring
these sedum plantings


166
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:43,629
for that messy patch
down by the foot of the drive.


167
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,506
It's like the European houseleek,


168
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,222
only these have the most marvellous
little yellow blossoms.


169
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:51,690
Now, all it wants for the first few days


170
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:55,180
is just a tiny dollop of water,
and then you'll find it absolutely thrives.


171
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:58,233
Well, thank you, Helen.
That's so kind of you.


172
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:01,187
Would you like some coffee?


173
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,199
Is there something
I can do for you, Helen?


174
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:17,661
I almost forgot.


175
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:21,379
There is one small favour
I would like to ask.


176
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:28,650
It's about... It's about my son, John.
He's been in the hospital.


177
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:30,883
I'm sorry. Is everything all right?


178
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:36,937
Well, actually, just for the time being,
he's in Pleasant Brook. Psychiatric.


179
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:44,354
Oh, I see.
- Well, it's nothing serious.


180
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:50,037
He just got a little run down. Things can
just get the better of us sometimes.


181
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:54,076
Don't you agree?
- Yes. Of course.


182
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,980
It's a marvellous facility


183
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:59,600
and the treatments
seem to be doing wonders for him.


184
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,120
Anyway, they said getting him out
for an afternoon


185
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:04,713
might do him a little bit of good.


186
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:08,758
I think he finds my friends
a little conventional, quite frankly.


187
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:14,096
I mean, he's travelled.
He has a Ph.D. in mathematics.


188
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:18,061
I suppose you could say
he's an intellectual.


189
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:22,977
It would do him a world of good
to meet a young couple like you.


190
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:25,188
Well, we'd love to meet him.


191
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,155
Really?
- Yes.


192
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:32,322
We'd love to.


193
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:35,748
Thank you, dear.


194
00:18:38,294 --> 00:18:39,622
Thank you.


195
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,166
Well, I must be off.


196
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:59,187
I remember the first day
you came off the train.


197
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:02,767
You weren't like my other clients.
You were different.


198
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:07,194
You just seemed special.


199
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:13,953
Of course, you still are.


200
00:19:15,914 --> 00:19:19,330
Remember, just a dollop. I must scoot.
Toodle-oo.


201
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:26,587
Bye.


202
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:46,190
I think you got me a little drunk.


203
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:56,028
You know what today is?


204
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:57,361
Monday?


205
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:04,578
It's my birthday. I'm 30 years old today.


206
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,707
Happy birthday!
- Thank you.


207
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:19,220
What was the name of that department
you made up again?


208
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,800
Visual Aids.


209
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:30,613
What a joke.


210
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:37,860
What a joke. Oh, my.


211
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:43,208
You want to hear a real joke?
- Yes.


212
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:48,875
My old man worked at Knox.
- Yeah?


213
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,709
He was a salesman in Yonkers.


214
00:20:55,889 --> 00:21:00,267
Once a year he used to take me
into the city for lunch.


215
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:04,178
It was supposed to be a very special,
life-advice sort of occasion.


216
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:07,269
Nice.
- No. Not really.


217
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,728
I used to sit there and think,


218
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:17,028
"I hope to Christ I don't end up like you."


219
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:25,374
Now, here I am,
a 30-year-old Knox man.


220
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,629
Can you beat that?


221
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,959
I think I kind of lost you...


222
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:39,690
Your father worked for Knox?


223
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:45,928
I'm sorry, everything's just kind of
going out of focus.


224
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:56,989
Why don't we get some air,
you and me?


225
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:37,692
<i>Is this you?</i>


226
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,073
Yeah.


227
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:45,035
You been to Paris?
- I've never really been anywhere.


228
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,209
Maybe I'll take you with me then.


229
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:51,170
I'm going back the first chance I get,
I tell you.


230
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:53,870
People are alive there. Not like here.


231
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:06,345
All I know, April, is I want to feel things.


232
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:11,516
Really feel them, you know.


233
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,733
<i>How's that for an ambition?</i>


234
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:24,370
Frank Wheeler? I think you're the most
interesting person I've ever met.


235
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:36,380
I guess this wasn't what you had in mind
when you went to work this morning?


236
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:38,626
No. It certainly wasn't.


237
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:00,188
Do you have a cigarette, Frank?


238
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,237
Yeah, sure.


239
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,668
There you go.


240
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:18,010
Can I get you a drink or anything?


241
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:20,339
No thanks, Maureen. Actually, it's...


242
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,590
It's getting kind of late.
I guess I'd better be cutting out.


243
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:30,646
Gee, that's right.
Did you miss your train?


244
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:34,160
That's all right, I'll catch the next one.


245
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:37,610
Listen, you were swell.


246
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:46,619
Take care now.


247
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:24,029
Frank.
- Why are you all dressed up?


248
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:28,526
First of all, I missed you all day
and I want to say I'm sorry.


249
00:25:29,246 --> 00:25:32,282
I'm sorry for the way I've been
since the play.


250
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:36,041
I'm sorry for everything, and I love you.


251
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:40,166
The rest can wait.


252
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:46,053
Now, you just wait here
till I call you. Okay?


253
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:47,628
Okay.


254
00:25:57,316 --> 00:25:59,937
All right, Frank. You can come in now.


255
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:18,340
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>


256
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:20,878
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>


257
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:25,336
<i>Happy birthday, dear Daddy</i>


258
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,301
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>


259
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:33,682
Happy birthday, darling.


260
00:26:33,978 --> 00:26:36,765
I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too.


261
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:54,612
Frank.


262
00:27:01,797 --> 00:27:06,380
Frank. I have had
the most wonderful idea.


263
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:10,504
I've been thinking about it all day.
- Baby, what's all this about?


264
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:12,632
Do you know how much money
we have saved?


265
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:15,933
Enough to live on for six months
without you earning another dime.


266
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:19,187
And with the money we could get from
the house and the car, longer than that.


267
00:27:19,314 --> 00:27:21,141
"What we could get for the house"?


268
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:24,686
Sweetheart, what are you talking about?
Where are we going to live?


269
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,186
Paris.


270
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:29,361
What?


271
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,614
You always said it was the only place
you'd ever been


272
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:35,362
that you wanted to go back to,
the only place that was worth living.


273
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,040
So why don't we go there?


274
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:41,377
You're serious?
- Yes. What's stopping us?


275
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:45,540
What's stopping us? Well, I can think
of a number of different things.


276
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:49,250
For example, what kind of a job
could I possibly get?


277
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:53,799
You won't be getting any
kind of a job, because I will.


278
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:55,719
Oh, right, right.


279
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:58,176
Don't laugh at me. Listen a minute.


280
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:01,100
Do you know what they pay
for secretarial positions


281
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,271
in government agencies in Europe?
- No, I don't.


282
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,770
Listen, Frank, I'm serious about this.
Do you think I'm kidding or something?


283
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,026
Okay, okay.
I just have a couple of questions, is all.


284
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:11,861
For one thing, what exactly
am I supposed to be doing


285
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:14,234
while you're out earning all this money?


286
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:18,202
Don't you see? That's the whole idea.


287
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,956
You'll be doing what you should've
been allowed to do seven years ago.


288
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:23,746
You'll have time.


289
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:26,080
For the first time in your life
you'll have time to find out


290
00:28:26,215 --> 00:28:28,610
what it is that you actually want to do.


291
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,879
And when you figure it out,


292
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,660
you'll have the time and the freedom
to start doing it.


293
00:28:36,642 --> 00:28:39,892
Sweetheart, it's just
not very realistic, is all.


294
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:48,183
No, Frank. This is what's unrealistic.


295
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:52,814
It's unrealistic for a man
with a fine mind to go on working


296
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:55,613
year after year at a job he can't stand,


297
00:28:55,744 --> 00:28:58,280
coming home to a place he can't stand,


298
00:28:57,621 --> 00:29:01,619
to a wife who's equally unable to stand
the same things.


299
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:05,040
Do you want to know the worst part?


300
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:10,380
Our whole existence here
is based on this great premise


301
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:13,797
that we're special and superior
to the whole thing.


302
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:15,722
But we're not.


303
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:18,388
We're just like everyone else.


304
00:29:18,517 --> 00:29:22,384
Look at us. We've bought into
the same ridiculous delusion.


305
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:24,681
This idea that
you have to resign from life


306
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:27,686
and settle down the moment
you have children.


307
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:31,649
And we've been
punishing each other for it.


308
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,734
Listen, we decided to move out here.


309
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:36,818
No one forced me
to take the job at Knox.


310
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:39,657
I mean, whoever said I was meant
to be a big deal, anyway?


311
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:43,916
When I first met you, there was nothing
in the world you couldn't do or be.


312
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:45,834
When you first met me
I was a little wise guy


313
00:29:45,961 --> 00:29:46,957
with a big mouth, that's all.


314
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:50,088
You were not.
How can you even say that?


315
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:56,252
Okay. Okay, so I'll have time.


316
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,929
And God knows that's appealing.
It's very appealing.


317
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,342
And everything you're saying
makes sense


318
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,514
if I had a definite talent,
if I were a writer or an artist.


319
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:08,186
No. But, Frank, listen. Listen to me.


320
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,106
It's what you are that's being stifled.


321
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:15,614
It's what you are that's being denied
and denied in this kind of life.


322
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,778
And what's that?


323
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:24,207
Don't you know?


324
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:30,570
You're the most beautiful
and wonderful thing in the world.


325
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,052
You're a man.


326
00:30:54,947 --> 00:31:00,701
This is our chance, Frank.
This is our one chance.


327
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:07,663
Okay.


328
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,793
Okay?


329
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:18,586
Why not? Why the hell not?


330
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:44,866
Good morning, all.
- Morning, Frank.


331
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:47,155
Franklin. Good to see your shining face.


332
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:52,166
What's the news?
- Fellas, I'm moving to Paris.


333
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:56,789
Indeed. And I'm moving to Tangiers.


334
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:17,107
Intra-company letter to Toledo.


335
00:32:17,238 --> 00:32:21,899
Attention B.F. Chalmers,
Branch Manager.


336
00:32:23,535 --> 00:32:26,702
With regard to recent and repeated
correspondence,


337
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,920
this is to advise
that the matter has been


338
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,750
very satisfactorily taken in hand, period.


339
00:32:32,878 --> 00:32:38,085
Paragraph. We wholly agree that
the existing brochure is unsuitable.


340
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:41,714
To this end, we have developed, quote,


341
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:50,388
"Speaking of Production Control."


342
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,820
Here you go, Mrs Wheeler. These are
the traveller's cheques you requested.


343
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:07,026
Yes.
- Your steamer reservations.


344
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,077
These I'll pass on
to the embassy for you.


345
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,999
Good luck.
- Thank you.


346
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,211
September. October at the outside.


347
00:33:22,177 --> 00:33:23,885
I just happen to think
people are better off


348
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:27,080
doing some kind of work
they actually like.


349
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:29,599
Right. Right, yes.
- Absolutely, absolutely.


350
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:35,148
But, I mean, assuming there is
this true vocation waiting for you,


351
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:39,356
wouldn't you be just as likely
to discover it here as there?


352
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,735
I don't think it's possible
to discover anything


353
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:47,151
on the 15th floor of the Knox building,


354
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:49,907
and I don't think any of you do either.


355
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:51,091
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!


356
00:34:53,227 --> 00:34:55,515
Michael.
- Daddy, will you read us...


357
00:34:56,105 --> 00:35:01,146
...all the way to here.


358
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:05,235
We have to take a big boat ride
across the sea to get there.


359
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:09,741
But I won't know anybody there.
- I know. I know. Neither will I.


360
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,778
But remember how you felt
when you started school?


361
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:15,535
And now look
how many friends you have.


362
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:19,249
You'll never guess
what they eat in Paris.


363
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,626
You'll never guess.
- What?


364
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:24,795
Slimy snails.
- Snails?


365
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:27,926
Slimy snails and icky frog's legs.


366
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,234
Milly, where are you, doll?


367
00:35:44,194 --> 00:35:47,112
You better get changed,
they'll be here soon.


368
00:35:48,157 --> 00:35:51,276
Is that what you're wearing?
- Don't you like it?


369
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,160
Yeah, yeah. You look great, doll.


370
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:58,616
Guess I better haul ass.


371
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:16,679
Hiya, gang.


372
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:23,690
What you watching?


373
00:37:03,274 --> 00:37:04,353
Shep?


374
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:09,191
I was calling you and calling you.


375
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:13,236
Hi.


376
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:22,998
Here we go. Just a little something.


377
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:30,376
Those look great. I'm starving.
- April, I can't get over it,


378
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:34,052
you look like the cat that ate the canary.


379
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:38,557
Do you have something to tell us?
Just a little bit of news?


380
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:42,848
Well, actually, Milly, we... Well, we do
have some important news, yes.


381
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:44,302
I knew it.


382
00:37:44,982 --> 00:37:47,769
Honey, why don't you tell them?
Go ahead.


383
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,070
We're going to Europe. To Paris.


384
00:37:57,995 --> 00:37:59,193
To live.


385
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:05,164
What?
- When?


386
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:08,751
In September.
- But what for?


387
00:38:10,341 --> 00:38:14,837
What for?
Well, because we've always wanted to.


388
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:17,847
Because the kids are young enough.
Because it's beautiful.


389
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:21,223
I mean, really.
Shep, you've been there, you tell her.


390
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:23,593
Yeah, it's a great city.
- Yeah.


391
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:33,312
When did you make this decision?


392
00:38:35,074 --> 00:38:37,565
About a week ago?
It's hard to remember.


393
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:39,694
We just suddenly decided to go,
that's all.


394
00:38:39,828 --> 00:38:43,957
About a week ago, you tell us now.
- We had to get used to the idea.


395
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:47,036
So, what's the deal, Frank?
You get a job over there, or what?


396
00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:51,214
No, no. Not exactly.
- What do you mean, "Not exactly"?


397
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,299
Frank won't be getting
any kind of a job, because I will.


398
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,843
So what are you going to do, Frank?


399
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:06,180
I'm going to study.
And I'm going to read.


400
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:11,186
I suppose I'm going to finally figure out
what I want to do with my life, Shep.


401
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,187
While she supports you?


402
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,569
Yes. While she supports me.


403
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:20,310
In the beginning.


404
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:22,537
You wouldn't believe what they pay
for secretarial work


405
00:39:22,704 --> 00:39:24,531
in those government agencies
over there.


406
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:27,334
NATO and ECA and those places.


407
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,120
And the cost of living
is dirt cheap, right?


408
00:39:30,254 --> 00:39:31,713
It's so cheap.


409
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:36,586
The truth is we just need
something different.


410
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,379
We're not getting any younger and
we don't want life to just pass us by.


411
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:41,973
That's right.


412
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:45,717
Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids.


413
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,853
I mean it. It really sounds wonderful.


414
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:52,058
Thank you, Milly.
- Oh, Milly.


415
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:55,730
We'll certainly miss you both.
Won't we, sweetie? Golly.


416
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,523
Sure.
- We'll miss you, too.


417
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:58,652
Of course.
- True.


418
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:00,822
We should have a toast or something.
To Paris.


419
00:40:00,951 --> 00:40:02,149
To Paris.
- To Paris.


420
00:40:02,286 --> 00:40:03,880
To Paris.


421
00:40:04,997 --> 00:40:06,621
Cheers.
- Cheers.


422
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:21,969
You know what I think?


423
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:23,838
What?


424
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:28,140
I think this whole plan
sounds a little immature.


425
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:30,260
Oh, God, I am so relieved.


426
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,271
Me, too.
I was thinking that the whole time.


427
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,938
I mean, what kind of man
is going to sit around


428
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:38,778
in his bathrobe all day picking his nose


429
00:40:38,948 --> 00:40:41,355
while his wife goes out and works?
- I don't know, Shep.


430
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,116
I just don't know.


431
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,920
Why are you crying?


432
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:56,370
What's the matter?


433
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:03,337
It's nothing. I'm just so relieved.


434
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:06,511
Shep.


435
00:41:06,642 --> 00:41:12,976
Don't cry. Please. It's all right.
Everything's going to be all right.


436
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:21,240
My God, their faces! Oh, God.


437
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:23,147
Oh, God!


438
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:26,869
You know what this is like,
April, honestly?


439
00:41:27,871 --> 00:41:28,951
Just talking like this?


440
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:32,746
The whole idea of going off
to Europe this way?


441
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,910
This is the way I felt going up to the line
the first time, in the war.


442
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:39,834
I mean, I was probably
just as scared as everyone else,


443
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:43,342
but inside I never felt better.


444
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:47,660
I felt alive. I felt full of blood. I felt...


445
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:51,015
Everything just...
Everything seemed more real.


446
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:52,805
The guys in their uniforms.


447
00:41:52,938 --> 00:41:57,565
The snow on the fields, the trees.
And all of us just walking.


448
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:01,357
I mean, I was scared, of course.


449
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,500
But I just kept thinking,
"This is it, you know. This is the truth."


450
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:12,538
I felt that way once, too.


451
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,116
When?


452
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,918
The first time you made love to me.


453
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,965
April.


454
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:10,921
Frank.


455
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:40,374
What's up?
- Bart Pollock's here.


456
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,545
He's in Bandy's office.


457
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:46,086
Big deal, huh?


458
00:43:51,515 --> 00:43:53,971
Looks like he wants to talk to you.


459
00:43:56,645 --> 00:44:00,200
Hey, keep my name out of it.


460
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:09,730
Frank. Good to see you.
You know Bart Pollock?


461
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:13,947
Well, we've never met, but of course...
- Good to know you, Frank.


462
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,653
"Speaking of Production Control"?


463
00:44:19,835 --> 00:44:24,663
Frank, this is a crackerjack.


464
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,587
They are tickled to death in Toledo.


465
00:44:37,686 --> 00:44:38,350
Really?


466
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,524
So, this guy Pollock was perfect
presidential material in the worst sense.


467
00:44:44,693 --> 00:44:49,023
A million dollar smile and about three
pounds of muscle between the ears.


468
00:44:49,156 --> 00:44:51,232
April, you should have heard this guy.


469
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:55,863
"Frank, this is a crackerjack."
What a horse's ass.


470
00:44:56,163 --> 00:44:59,698
Wish I'd seen his face
when you told him you were leaving.


471
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:01,866
Yeah.


472
00:45:08,759 --> 00:45:10,218
Here they come.


473
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,637
Sorry to be late.
- You're not late.


474
00:45:15,766 --> 00:45:18,339
The traffic was terrible.
- Thank you. You didn't have to do that.


475
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,719
Good to see you.
- Wasn't it terrible, Howard?


476
00:45:20,854 --> 00:45:21,886
Well, Route 12.


477
00:45:22,022 --> 00:45:23,849
By the time they finish
that stretch of road,


478
00:45:23,983 --> 00:45:26,900
they'll have to start all over again, right?


479
00:45:27,736 --> 00:45:31,500
And you must be John?
- Say hello, John.


480
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:35,035
Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.


481
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:39,747
Where are your darling children?
- They're at a birthday party.


482
00:45:39,915 --> 00:45:42,074
Sorry they couldn't be here.
- Don't worry.


483
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:44,540
If I had a certified lunatic
coming around my house,


484
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,125
I'd probably get the kids
out of the way, too.


485
00:45:47,256 --> 00:45:51,550
Look at all this food. You didn't
have to go to any trouble for us.


486
00:45:51,677 --> 00:45:53,088
It's just some sandwiches.


487
00:45:53,262 --> 00:45:55,587
John, would you like a sandwich?


488
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,509
Helen's been talking it up
about you people for months.


489
00:45:59,643 --> 00:46:02,348
The nice young Wheelers
on Revolutionary Road,


490
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:06,062
the nice young Revolutionaries
on Wheeler Road.


491
00:46:07,192 --> 00:46:10,775
Would anyone like some sherry?
- Please don't bother, Frank.


492
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:12,103
I'd like some sherry.


493
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:15,822
And I'll drink Helen's, too,
if she doesn't beat me to it.


494
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:20,287
But, hey, you got a high-ball glass?


495
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,520
Put a couple-three ice cubes in it,
pour it up to the brim.


496
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,000
That's the way I like it.
- I think I can handle that.


497
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:37,884
This egg salad is delicious, April.
You must tell me how you fix it.


498
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:41,016
You a lawyer, Frank?
- No. No, I'm not.


499
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:42,630
I could use a lawyer.


500
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:45,231
John, let's not get started again
about the lawyer.


501
00:46:45,356 --> 00:46:46,351
Pop, couldn't you just sit there


502
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,851
and eat your wonderful egg salad
and quit horning in?


503
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:53,274
See, I've got a good
many questions to ask


504
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,210
and I'm willing to pay for the answers.


505
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:58,819
Now, I don't need to be told that a man
who goes after his mother


506
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:03,780
with a coffee table is putting himself in
a weak position legally, that's obvious.


507
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:06,537
John, come and have a look
out this fabulous picture window.


508
00:47:06,669 --> 00:47:09,041
If he hits her with it and kills her,
that's a criminal case.


509
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:12,338
Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
- If all he does is break the coffee table


510
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,293
and give her
a certain amount of aggravation


511
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,380
and she decides to
go to court over it, that's a civil case.


512
00:47:17,513 --> 00:47:20,004
Maybe we'll have a rainbow.
John, come have a look.


513
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,177
Ma, how about doing everybody
a favour? How about shutting up!


514
00:47:23,686 --> 00:47:25,393
Settle down, now.


515
00:47:26,355 --> 00:47:30,222
Maybe I can look into it, recommend
someone. What do you say?


516
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:40,944
So, what do you do, Frank?


517
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:45,282
I work at Knox Business Machines,
actually.


518
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,076
You design the machines?


519
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:50,329
Nope.
- Make them, sell them, repair them?


520
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,380
All these questions.
- I help sell them, I guess.


521
00:47:53,924 --> 00:47:58,385
I work in the office. Actually, it's...


522
00:47:58,512 --> 00:48:00,006
Well, it's sort of a stupid job, really.


523
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:03,009
There's nothing interesting
about it at all.


524
00:48:04,268 --> 00:48:06,640
What do you do it for then?


525
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,562
Maybe Frank doesn't like
being questioned.


526
00:48:08,689 --> 00:48:11,725
Okay, okay, okay.
I know it's none of my business.


527
00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:14,148
And besides, I know the answer.


528
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:17,500
You want to play house,
you got to have a job.


529
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:21,030
You want to play very nice house,
very sweet house,


530
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,250
then you've got to have
a job you don't like.


531
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,909
Anyone comes along and says,
"What do you do it for?"


532
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,998
He's probably on a four-hour pass
from the state funny farm.


533
00:48:32,379 --> 00:48:35,914
All agreed? Ma?
- Sorry, Frank.


534
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:41,340
Don't be. Don't be. Actually, John,
I agree with everything you just said.


535
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:46,134
We both do. That's why I'm quitting
the job in the fall. We're taking off.


536
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:48,059
We're moving to Paris.


537
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,848
Did you know about this, Ma?


538
00:48:55,611 --> 00:49:00,189
How do you feel about that, Ma?
The nice young Wheelers...


539
00:49:03,744 --> 00:49:08,869
The nice young Wheelers are taking off.


540
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:18,338
John, please.
- Steady down, Son.


541
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:27,766
John. John. How about some fresh air?
What do you say?


542
00:49:27,893 --> 00:49:29,637
If that's all right with you?


543
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:33,305
I don't know if it's such a good idea...
- If John wants to, I don't see the harm.


544
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,807
Good.
- After you.


545
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:45,986
I hear you're a mathematician.
- You hear wrong. It's all gone now.


546
00:49:46,912 --> 00:49:48,027
All gone?


547
00:49:48,163 --> 00:49:51,034
You know what
electrical shock treatments are?


548
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,826
Yes. Yes, I do.


549
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,537
I've had 37.


550
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:01,169
Supposed to jolt out
the emotional problems.


551
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:05,714
Just jolted out the mathematics.
- How awful.


552
00:50:06,557 --> 00:50:11,515
"How awful"? Why,
because mathematics is so interesting?


553
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:15,272
No. Because the shocks
must be awful and,


554
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:19,729
well, because it's awful not to be able
to do what it is that you want to do.


555
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:22,353
I think mathematics must be dull.


556
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:26,025
I like your girl, Frank.


557
00:50:26,243 --> 00:50:28,000
Me, too.


558
00:50:27,911 --> 00:50:31,078
So, what do a couple of people like you
have to run away from?


559
00:50:31,248 --> 00:50:33,620
We're not running.
- So what's in Paris?


560
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:36,787
A different way of life.
- Maybe we are running.


561
00:50:37,588 --> 00:50:41,716
We're running from the hopeless
emptiness of the whole life here, right?


562
00:50:41,842 --> 00:50:43,716
The hopeless emptiness?


563
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:52,261
Now you've said it. Plenty of people
are on to the emptiness,


564
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:57,391
but it takes real guts
to see the hopelessness.


565
00:51:02,821 --> 00:51:03,817
Wow.


566
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,035
You know, he's the first person


567
00:51:21,173 --> 00:51:24,044
who seemed to know
what we were talking about.


568
00:51:24,176 --> 00:51:30,012
Yeah. That's true, isn't it?
Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.


569
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:35,594
If being crazy means
living life as if it matters,


570
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:38,683
then I don't care
if we are completely insane.


571
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:42,606
Do you?


572
00:51:45,656 --> 00:51:46,652
No.


573
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:50,778
I love you so much.


574
00:52:02,131 --> 00:52:05,560
Tell you something, Frank.
That Ted Bandy, nice guy.


575
00:52:05,676 --> 00:52:07,004
Real sport.


576
00:52:07,136 --> 00:52:08,796
Good enough department head and all.


577
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:11,005
But I'm a little sore at him
for the way he's kept you


578
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,132
under a bushel all these years.


579
00:52:13,267 --> 00:52:16,802
This place okay for you?
- It's just fine, sir. Just fine.


580
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:20,261
One thing interests me, Frank,
and one thing only.


581
00:52:20,399 --> 00:52:24,064
Selling the electronic computer
to the American businessman.


582
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:28,776
That's why I'm assembling a team.
Men like you.


583
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,151
Not your average salesmen.


584
00:52:31,285 --> 00:52:33,230
It'll mean more money,


585
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:36,202
and, I got to be honest,
maybe more of a time commitment.


586
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:39,789
But you'll be a part of
something exciting, Wheeler.


587
00:52:39,919 --> 00:52:41,163
Computers.


588
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:47,590
Well, sir, it sounds exciting.


589
00:52:47,718 --> 00:52:50,020
Bart.
- Bart.


590
00:52:54,558 --> 00:52:56,930
Bart, let me ask you a question.


591
00:52:57,686 --> 00:53:01,305
Do you happen to remember
an Earl Wheeler? Out of Yonkers?


592
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:06,943
Can't say that I do. Relation of yours?
- My father.


593
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:11,260
He worked as a salesman for Knox
for almost 20 years.


594
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:13,825
Earl Wheeler.


595
00:53:14,995 --> 00:53:16,537
Earl Wheeler.


596
00:53:18,957 --> 00:53:21,531
There's no reason you'd remember him.


597
00:53:23,045 --> 00:53:25,570
Well, I'm sure he was a good man.


598
00:53:32,262 --> 00:53:37,601
Listen, Bart, there's something
I should have mentioned earlier.


599
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:42,599
I'm going to be leaving the firm
in the fall.


600
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,561
Another outfit?
- No, no, it's not another outfit.


601
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:51,220
Now, look, Frank.
Is it a question of money?


602
00:53:51,198 --> 00:53:52,609
Because if it is, there's no reason


603
00:53:52,741 --> 00:53:53,773
we can't get together on a satisfactory...


604
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:57,076
Well, I sure appreciate that,
but no, it's not the money.


605
00:53:57,204 --> 00:54:02,199
It's... Well, it's more of a personal thing.


606
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,536
I hope you understand.


607
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:06,503
A personal thing?


608
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,579
I see.


609
00:54:09,883 --> 00:54:13,133
Frank, let me tell you something
my father told me.


610
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,640
A man only gets
a couple of chances in life.


611
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:18,805
If he doesn't grab them by the balls,


612
00:54:18,934 --> 00:54:20,678
it won't be long before
he's sitting around wondering


613
00:54:20,811 --> 00:54:23,100
how he got to be second rate.


614
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:30,570
I guess so.


615
00:54:31,655 --> 00:54:34,360
So, do me a favour. Sleep on it.


616
00:54:36,202 --> 00:54:38,194
Discuss it with your wife.


617
00:54:39,538 --> 00:54:41,163
Because let's be honest,
where the hell would any of us be


618
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:43,283
without our wives, anyway?


619
00:54:46,754 --> 00:54:50,940
And, Frank, in all sincerity,
if you do decide to join us,


620
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:53,711
I believe it'll be a thing
you'll never regret.


621
00:54:54,804 --> 00:54:57,341
And I believe something else, too.


622
00:54:57,723 --> 00:55:00,807
I believe it'd be a fine memorial
to your dad.


623
00:55:03,312 --> 00:55:06,313
Think about it, Frank.
Really think about it.


624
00:55:13,238 --> 00:55:15,610
Knowing what you've got, comma,


625
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:21,000
knowing what you need, comma,


626
00:55:22,164 --> 00:55:25,996
knowing what you can do without, dash.


627
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,959
That's inventory control.


628
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:50,562
<i>Knowing what you've got, comma,</i>


629
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,024
<i>knowing what you need, comma,</i>


630
00:55:57,032 --> 00:56:00,733
<i>knowing what you can do without, dash.</i>


631
00:56:02,704 --> 00:56:04,614
<i>That's inventory control.</i>


632
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:07,912
Hi, Frank.


633
00:56:09,879 --> 00:56:11,289
Working late?


634
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:15,630
Yeah. I got to dig myself out here.


635
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:20,377
I heard you were getting promoted.


636
00:56:21,765 --> 00:56:23,046
Big shot.


637
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,890
I guess your dad would have been
real proud, huh?


638
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,864
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.


639
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,752
So maybe I should take you
for a drink or something?


640
00:56:54,089 --> 00:56:56,794
You know, celebrate.


641
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:02,924
Yeah, maybe.


642
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:10,170
I'll just get my things.


643
00:57:17,237 --> 00:57:19,111
I'm going to bring my doll carriage


644
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:22,110
and my three Easter rabbits
and my giraffe


645
00:57:22,243 --> 00:57:25,243
and all my dolls and my doll house
and my crayons...


646
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:27,078
I thought maybe
we'd give the doll house to Madeline.


647
00:57:27,206 --> 00:57:29,198
I don't want to give the doll house
to Madeline.


648
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:30,531
But I already explained to you,


649
00:57:30,668 --> 00:57:32,210
the big things
are going to be hard to pack.


650
00:57:32,336 --> 00:57:33,711
But she can have my bear,


651
00:57:33,837 --> 00:57:37,253
and my three Easter rabbits.
- No! Just the big things.


652
00:57:37,383 --> 00:57:39,620
Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside
and play with Michael?


653
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:42,043
I don't feel like it.
- You've been inside all day.


654
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:43,341
I don't feel like it.


655
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,556
Well, I don't feel like
explaining everything 15 times


656
00:57:46,683 --> 00:57:49,768
to somebody who's too bored and silly
to listen!


657
00:57:56,652 --> 00:57:59,700
All right, April. What's the matter?
- Nothing.


658
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,199
I don't believe you.
Did something happen this morning?


659
00:58:02,324 --> 00:58:05,740
Nothing happened today that I haven't
known about for days and days.


660
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:06,901
What?


661
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:10,960
Oh, God, Frank,
please don't look so dense.


662
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:12,284
You mean you haven't guessed
or anything?


663
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,790
April, what are you talking about?


664
00:58:18,006 --> 00:58:20,046
I'm pregnant, that's all.


665
00:58:22,886 --> 00:58:23,918
What?


666
00:58:24,054 --> 00:58:26,296
Frank, I meant to wait
till the kids were in bed to tell you,


667
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,349
but I just...
Well, I've been pretty sure all week


668
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,757
and today I went to the doctor,


669
00:58:30,895 --> 00:58:33,646
and now I can't even pretend
it's not true.


670
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:37,141
How long?
- Ten weeks.


671
00:58:39,611 --> 00:58:44,024
Ten weeks. Ten weeks?
And you wait until now to tell me?


672
00:58:44,158 --> 00:58:49,947
I thought... I don't know what I thought.
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.


673
00:58:50,205 --> 00:58:52,827
I know. I know you are. All right?


674
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:56,124
There are things we can do.


675
00:58:56,253 --> 00:58:59,207
We don't have to let this stop us
from going, do we?


676
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,546
Remember that girl at school
I told you about?


677
00:59:01,675 --> 00:59:05,258
As long as we take care of it
before 12 weeks, it's fine.


678
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,176
We've got to be together in this, Frank.


679
00:59:11,518 --> 00:59:16,180
Well, we'll figure it out. All right?


680
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:19,973
Come here.


681
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:26,279
Twelve weeks.
So we have time to decide, right?


682
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:27,946
Right.


683
00:59:30,329 --> 00:59:31,704
I love you.


684
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:35,790
I love you, too.


685
01:00:21,797 --> 01:00:25,795
So, Frank, how's work?
They gonna survive without you?


686
01:00:28,012 --> 01:00:31,096
Actually, something kind of funny
happened the other day.


687
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:35,759
I did some dumb little piece of work
to get myself off the hook with Bandy,


688
01:00:35,894 --> 01:00:38,682
and suddenly,
I'm the bright young man.


689
01:00:39,899 --> 01:00:42,760
That's always the way, ain't it?
- It's incredible.


690
01:00:42,568 --> 01:00:44,525
I mean, I knocked this thing off
in a couple of minutes


691
01:00:44,653 --> 01:00:48,521
and now they want me to join
their team of "specialist" salesmen.


692
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:50,194
Morons.


693
01:00:52,327 --> 01:00:54,201
Well, it would be funny
if they weren't offering


694
01:00:54,329 --> 01:00:56,038
so much damn money.


695
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:02,940
So, are you tempted?


696
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,214
Well, it's just kind of ironic,
don't you think?


697
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,398
I thought you turned the job down.


698
01:01:33,786 --> 01:01:34,948
Not yet.


699
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:38,920
It's just an option, that's all.


700
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:42,578
With the kind of money they're talking,
things could be different for us here.


701
01:01:42,711 --> 01:01:45,285
We could get a better place. Travel.


702
01:01:46,256 --> 01:01:49,542
The point is, we could be happy here,
at least for a little while.


703
01:01:49,677 --> 01:01:51,835
It is possible that Parisians
aren't the only ones


704
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:54,841
capable of leading
interesting lives, April.


705
01:01:54,973 --> 01:01:56,931
So you've made up your mind?


706
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:01,009
No. No. Like I said, it's just an option.
That's all.


707
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,023
And supposing you're right.


708
01:02:07,277 --> 01:02:11,192
You make all this money
and we have this interesting life here.


709
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:16,840
Won't you still be wasting your life
toiling away at a job you find ridiculous?


710
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,619
Maybe we let that be my business,
all right?


711
01:02:19,748 --> 01:02:21,124
Your business?


712
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:25,082
You know what? It's too hot for this.
I'm going to go get wet.


713
01:02:37,182 --> 01:02:40,551
You don't want to go, do you?
- Come on, April. Of course, I do.


714
01:02:40,686 --> 01:02:43,603
No, you don't.
Because you've never tried at anything.


715
01:02:43,731 --> 01:02:46,518
And if you don't try at anything,
you can't fail.


716
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:48,892
What the hell do you mean I don't try?


717
01:02:49,027 --> 01:02:52,230
I support you, don't I?
I pay for this house.


718
01:02:51,613 --> 01:02:54,070
I work 10 hours a day
at a job I can't stand.


719
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:57,000
You don't have to.
- Bullshit!


720
01:02:56,702 --> 01:02:57,865
Look, I'm not happy about it.


721
01:02:57,995 --> 01:03:00,912
But I have the backbone not to run away
from my responsibilities.


722
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,243
It takes backbone
to lead the life you want, Frank.


723
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:09,912
Where are you going?


724
01:03:10,048 --> 01:03:14,342
If it's all right with you, April,
I'm gonna go use the bathroom. Okay?


725
01:03:42,581 --> 01:03:45,920
What the hell are you going to do
with this?


726
01:03:45,584 --> 01:03:47,043
And what do you think
you're going to do?


727
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:48,794
You're going to stop me?
- You're damn right I am!


728
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:50,035
Go ahead and try.


729
01:03:50,172 --> 01:03:53,837
Listen to me. You do this, April,
you do this and I swear to God I'll...


730
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:56,256
You'll what? You'll leave me?
Is that a threat or a promise?


731
01:03:56,387 --> 01:03:58,060
When did you buy this, April?


732
01:03:57,596 --> 01:03:59,055
How long have you had this?
I want to know!


733
01:03:59,181 --> 01:04:00,212
Jesus Christ.


734
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:03,266
You really are being melodramatic
about this whole thing.


735
01:04:03,394 --> 01:04:06,976
As long as it's done
in the first 12 weeks, it's perfectly safe.


736
01:04:07,106 --> 01:04:10,190
That's now, April! Don't I get a say?
- Of course you do!


737
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:12,524
It would be for you, Frank.
Don't you see?


738
01:04:12,653 --> 01:04:14,610
So you can have time,
just like we talked about.


739
01:04:14,738 --> 01:04:16,067
How can it be for me
when the thought of it


740
01:04:16,198 --> 01:04:18,107
makes my stomach turn over,
for God's sake?


741
01:04:18,242 --> 01:04:19,617
Then it's for me.


742
01:04:19,743 --> 01:04:21,570
Tell me we can have the baby
in Paris, Frank.


743
01:04:21,703 --> 01:04:25,915
Tell me we can have a different life.
But don't make me stay here. Please.


744
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:29,244
We can't have the baby in Paris.
- Why not?


745
01:04:29,378 --> 01:04:32,379
I don't need everything we have here.
I don't care where we live.


746
01:04:32,506 --> 01:04:35,079
I mean, who made these rules, anyway?


747
01:04:36,135 --> 01:04:41,129
Look, the only reason we moved
out here was because I got pregnant.


748
01:04:41,265 --> 01:04:43,756
Then we had another child to prove
the first one wasn't a mistake.


749
01:04:43,892 --> 01:04:46,181
I mean, how long does it go on?


750
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:51,104
Frank.
Do you actually want another child?


751
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:56,561
Well, do you? Come on, tell me.


752
01:04:57,573 --> 01:05:01,300
Tell me the truth, Frank.
Remember that?


753
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:02,945
We used to live by it.


754
01:05:03,078 --> 01:05:05,700
And you know what's so good
about the truth?


755
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:09,930
Everyone knows what it is,
however long they've lived without it.


756
01:05:09,585 --> 01:05:13,629
No one forgets the truth, Frank.
They just get better at lying.


757
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:20,377
So tell me,
do you really want another child?


758
01:05:22,264 --> 01:05:24,387
All I know is what I feel.


759
01:05:26,935 --> 01:05:31,229
And anyone else in their right mind
would feel the same way, April.


760
01:05:31,357 --> 01:05:35,568
But I've had two children.
Doesn't that count in my favour?


761
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:38,648
Christ, April!
The fact that you even put it that way!


762
01:05:38,781 --> 01:05:42,730
You make it seem as if having children
is some sort of a goddamn punishment.


763
01:05:42,868 --> 01:05:44,908
I love my children, Frank.


764
01:05:46,955 --> 01:05:49,244
And you're sure about that, huh?


765
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:51,915
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?


766
01:05:52,044 --> 01:05:55,662
April, you just said our daughter
was a mistake.


767
01:05:56,215 --> 01:05:58,088
How do I know you didn't try
to get rid of her,


768
01:05:58,217 --> 01:05:59,794
or Michael for that matter?
- No.


769
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:02,756
How do I know you didn't try to flush
our entire fucking family


770
01:06:02,888 --> 01:06:05,889
down the toilet?
- No, that's not true. Of course I didn't.


771
01:06:06,016 --> 01:06:07,925
But how do I know, April?


772
01:06:08,143 --> 01:06:11,144
Stop. Please just stop, Frank.


773
01:06:11,689 --> 01:06:16,066
April, a normal woman,
a normal sane mother


774
01:06:16,193 --> 01:06:19,830
doesn't buy a piece of rubber tubing
to give herself an abortion


775
01:06:19,571 --> 01:06:22,822
so she can live out
some kind of a goddamn fantasy.


776
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:39,350
Look, all I'm saying is you don't seem
entirely rational about this thing.


777
01:06:40,217 --> 01:06:42,174
And I think it's about time
we found somebody


778
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,591
to help make some sense of your life.


779
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:48,802
And the new job's going to
pay for that, too?


780
01:06:51,103 --> 01:06:55,812
April, if you need a shrink,
it will be paid for.


781
01:06:56,942 --> 01:06:58,317
Obviously.


782
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:06,825
Okay. I guess there isn't much more
to say then, is there?


783
01:07:16,378 --> 01:07:20,380
So I guess Paris
was a pretty childish idea, huh?


784
01:07:25,554 --> 01:07:27,346
I guess maybe it was.


785
01:07:40,694 --> 01:07:44,692
April, we can be happy here.


786
01:07:46,075 --> 01:07:48,032
I can make you happy here.


787
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:52,528
We've had a great couple of months.
It doesn't need to end.


788
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:59,212
We're going to be okay. I promise.


789
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,091
I hope so, Frank.


790
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:08,553
I really hope so.


791
01:08:49,304 --> 01:08:53,110
Thank you for waiting.
Mr Pollock will see you now.


792
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,054
Thanks so much.


793
01:09:06,822 --> 01:09:09,147
Foiled by faulty contraception.


794
01:09:11,076 --> 01:09:12,570
I can't say that I'm sorry.


795
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:16,368
You'd have been sorely missed
in the old cubicle, I can tell you that.


796
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,203
Wouldn't have been the same
without you.


797
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:22,371
Besides... Well...


798
01:09:25,132 --> 01:09:26,128
What?


799
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:32,551
The plan always seemed
a touch unrealistic, don't you think?


800
01:09:37,353 --> 01:09:38,633
I suppose
it's none of my business, really.


801
01:09:38,771 --> 01:09:42,056
No. No. I suppose it isn't.


802
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:46,892
Well...


803
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:53,323
They'll be celebrating
in the secretarial pool.


804
01:10:22,606 --> 01:10:25,560
Hey! Remember the first time
you brought us here?


805
01:10:25,692 --> 01:10:26,807
Absolutely.


806
01:10:26,944 --> 01:10:31,024
You said it takes a special kind of taste
to enjoy Vito's Log Cabin.


807
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,909
It's so awful, it's kind of nice.


808
01:10:37,579 --> 01:10:43,618
Look at me. I'm just so happy.
Our little gang's back together again.


809
01:10:56,765 --> 01:11:00,099
Hey, Europe's not going anywhere.
- That's right.


810
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:25,628
April, honey, how about a dance?


811
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:30,668
Not right now. Maybe later.


812
01:11:30,799 --> 01:11:33,337
I'll dance.
- Okay.


813
01:11:48,233 --> 01:11:51,317
Guess she's still pretty blue
about Paris, huh?


814
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,269
Think she'll be okay?


815
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,154
Sure. Give us girls a couple of days
and we can get over anything.


816
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:58,810
Right.


817
01:12:00,245 --> 01:12:02,200
Frank.


818
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,698
Frank.


819
01:12:08,003 --> 01:12:09,118
Frank.


820
01:12:09,504 --> 01:12:11,129
Frank.


821
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:14,044
Are you okay? Are you okay? Milly?


822
01:12:14,843 --> 01:12:16,219
I'm so sorry.


823
01:12:17,346 --> 01:12:18,674
Excuse me.


824
01:12:23,686 --> 01:12:25,310
That's just great.


825
01:12:26,063 --> 01:12:28,981
How the hell
are we supposed to get out now?


826
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,645
Oh, boy.


827
01:12:32,236 --> 01:12:35,023
Don't worry about it, Shep.
We can wait. Really.


828
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:36,733
What about the sitter?


829
01:12:36,865 --> 01:12:39,866
Listen, why don't you drive Milly home,
then go home yourself.


830
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:42,906
That takes care of both sitters.
Then Shep can take me home later.


831
01:12:43,038 --> 01:12:45,660
Yeah, it's fine by me.
- Okay, then.


832
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:50,577
You... You'll be all right?
- Sure.


833
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:52,501
Okay.


834
01:12:54,091 --> 01:12:56,000
Good night.
- Good night.


835
01:12:56,635 --> 01:12:58,010
Feel better.


836
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:20,694
I'm sorry you're not
going away any more.


837
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:24,235
I know it was important to you.


838
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:29,910
Don't take this wrong,
but I've been there.


839
01:13:30,795 --> 01:13:33,629
They don't have so much
we don't have here.


840
01:13:34,298 --> 01:13:36,610
It didn't have to be Paris.


841
01:13:37,843 --> 01:13:42,010
You just wanted out, huh?


842
01:13:42,097 --> 01:13:44,130
I wanted in.


843
01:13:46,977 --> 01:13:50,595
I just wanted us to live again.


844
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,274
For years,
I thought we shared this secret.


845
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,114
That we would be
wonderful in the world.


846
01:14:08,832 --> 01:14:11,323
I didn't exactly know how, but just...


847
01:14:13,003 --> 01:14:15,990
Just the possibility kept me hoping.


848
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:24,506
How pathetic is that?


849
01:14:26,517 --> 01:14:27,927
So stupid.


850
01:14:30,354 --> 01:14:35,710
To put all your hopes in a promise
that was never made?


851
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,358
See, Frank knows.
He knows what he wants.


852
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:45,321
He's found his place. He's just fine.


853
01:14:46,745 --> 01:14:48,930
Married, two kids.


854
01:14:53,586 --> 01:14:55,329
It should be enough.


855
01:15:00,717 --> 01:15:02,176
It is for him.


856
01:15:06,932 --> 01:15:08,660
And he's right.


857
01:15:11,061 --> 01:15:14,679
We were never special or destined
or anything at all.


858
01:15:15,232 --> 01:15:16,892
Yes, you are.


859
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:19,724
You're...


860
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,190
You're the Wheelers.


861
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,324
You're a terrific couple.
Everybody says so.


862
01:15:27,703 --> 01:15:29,861
I saw a whole other future.


863
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:35,368
I can't stop seeing it.


864
01:15:40,632 --> 01:15:42,008
Can't leave,


865
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:45,672
can't stay.


866
01:15:48,057 --> 01:15:49,883
No damn use to anyone.


867
01:15:57,983 --> 01:15:59,228
Come on.


868
01:16:00,819 --> 01:16:02,194
Let's do it.


869
01:17:11,974 --> 01:17:13,136
Let me take you somewhere.


870
01:17:13,267 --> 01:17:16,600
No. Just do it here. Now.


871
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:04,682
April.


872
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:09,734
This is what I've always wanted.


873
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:12,522
I love you.


874
01:18:13,577 --> 01:18:15,119
Don't say that.


875
01:18:16,747 --> 01:18:20,330
No. I mean it, I love you.


876
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:24,291
Please, just be quiet for a minute.


877
01:18:28,759 --> 01:18:30,882
Then you can take me home.


878
01:19:21,854 --> 01:19:23,562
It's beautiful out.


879
01:19:24,815 --> 01:19:26,226
Yes, it is.


880
01:19:31,196 --> 01:19:33,106
You know what today is?


881
01:19:33,657 --> 01:19:36,113
It's 12 weeks.
- That's right.


882
01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:43,615
Look, this has been
kind of a crazy summer.


883
01:19:43,792 --> 01:19:45,785
We've both been under a strain.


884
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,624
I mean, I understand why you're upset.


885
01:19:49,339 --> 01:19:53,124
You know I'm not sleeping with you,
and you want to know why.


886
01:19:54,553 --> 01:19:59,345
Well, I'm sorry, Frank,
but I really don't feel like talking about it.


887
01:20:00,059 --> 01:20:03,060
All right.
Then what should we talk about, April?


888
01:20:03,187 --> 01:20:06,556
Would it be all right
if we didn't talk about anything?


889
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:10,273
I mean, can't we just take each day
as it comes, and do the best we can,


890
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,985
and not feel like we have to talk
about everything all the time?


891
01:20:14,114 --> 01:20:17,880
I don't think I'm suggesting that
we talk about everything all the time.


892
01:20:17,576 --> 01:20:21,739
Look, my point is we've both been
under a strain


893
01:20:21,872 --> 01:20:26,036
and we ought to be helping each other
out as much as we can right now.


894
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:30,124
I mean, God knows my own behaviour
has been pretty weird lately.


895
01:20:32,758 --> 01:20:36,838
As a matter of fact, there is something
I'd like to tell you about.


896
01:20:38,722 --> 01:20:42,138
I've been with a girl a few times,
in the city.


897
01:20:43,978 --> 01:20:46,184
A girl I hardly even know.


898
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:49,352
It was nothing to me,


899
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:53,730
but it's over now, really over.


900
01:20:54,279 --> 01:20:58,028
And if I weren't sure of that, I guess
I could never have told you about it.


901
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:04,872
Why did you?


902
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:08,300
Baby, I don't know.


903
01:21:08,043 --> 01:21:10,534
I think it's a simple case
of wanting to be a man again


904
01:21:10,671 --> 01:21:12,331
after all that abortion business.


905
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,083
Some kind of neurotic,
irrational need to prove something.


906
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:19,510
No. I don't mean
why did you have the girl.


907
01:21:19,638 --> 01:21:22,390
I mean, why did you tell me about it?


908
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:27,930
What do you mean?
- I mean, what's the point?


909
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:33,399
Is it supposed to make me jealous
or something?


910
01:21:33,527 --> 01:21:35,318
Is it supposed to make me
fall in love with you,


911
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:38,197
or back into bed with you, or what?


912
01:21:38,323 --> 01:21:41,942
I mean,
what would you like me to say, Frank?


913
01:21:43,662 --> 01:21:46,283
Why don't you say what you feel, April?


914
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,284
I don't feel anything.


915
01:21:50,002 --> 01:21:54,082
In other words, you don't care what I do
or who I fuck or anything?


916
01:21:57,801 --> 01:22:01,051
No, I guess that's right. I don't.


917
01:22:03,515 --> 01:22:05,140
Fuck who you like.


918
01:22:05,559 --> 01:22:08,726
April, don't you understand
that I want you to care?


919
01:22:08,854 --> 01:22:10,977
I know. I know you do.


920
01:22:12,191 --> 01:22:14,397
And I suppose I would if I loved you.


921
01:22:14,526 --> 01:22:17,646
But I don't think I do any more.
And I only just figured that out.


922
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:21,149
And that's why I'd just as soon
not do any talking right now.


923
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:23,655
Don't give me that shit, April.
Don't give me that.


924
01:22:23,827 --> 01:22:26,400
You know goddamn well you love me.
- You think so?


925
01:22:26,538 --> 01:22:28,330
You know goddamn well!


926
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:31,876
Anyone home?


927
01:22:36,381 --> 01:22:39,580
I'm sorry dinner's late.
Would anyone like another drink?


928
01:22:39,551 --> 01:22:43,252
Don't worry.
It's nice to just sit a bit and socialise.


929
01:22:43,555 --> 01:22:45,180
You shouldn't have gone to
all this trouble.


930
01:22:45,307 --> 01:22:46,967
With all your packing and whatnot.


931
01:22:47,101 --> 01:22:50,849
I imagine you have a lot on your plate.
No pun intended.


932
01:22:52,356 --> 01:22:54,514
Actually, there's been
a change of plans.


933
01:22:55,525 --> 01:22:57,815
I thought maybe it was obvious.


934
01:22:57,945 --> 01:22:59,190
April here is pregnant.


935
01:22:59,321 --> 01:23:02,358
Congratulations.
- Oh, April!


936
01:23:02,533 --> 01:23:05,652
I can't tell you how pleased I am!


937
01:23:05,786 --> 01:23:08,359
But I expect you'll be needing
a bigger house now, won't you?


938
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:11,284
Hold it a second, Ma.
Hold on a second, Ma.


939
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:15,331
I don't get this.
I mean, what's so obvious about it?


940
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:20,208
I mean, okay, she's pregnant, so what?
Don't people have babies in Europe?


941
01:23:20,384 --> 01:23:22,008
John...
- Suppose we just say


942
01:23:22,136 --> 01:23:25,006
that people anywhere
aren't very well advised to have babies


943
01:23:25,139 --> 01:23:27,214
unless they can afford them.


944
01:23:27,933 --> 01:23:32,560
Okay. Okay, it's a question of money.
Money's a good reason.


945
01:23:32,688 --> 01:23:37,017
But it's hardly ever the real reason.


946
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:42,311
What's the real reason?
Wife talk you out of it or what?


947
01:23:42,906 --> 01:23:46,821
Little woman decide she isn't
quite ready to quit playing house?


948
01:23:47,953 --> 01:23:50,278
No, no, that's not it. I can tell.


949
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:54,380
She looks too tough
and adequate as hell.


950
01:23:56,010 --> 01:24:00,087
Okay, then. It must've been you.
What happened?


951
01:24:00,215 --> 01:24:04,758
John, please. You're being very rude.
- No, no. What happened, Frank?


952
01:24:10,225 --> 01:24:11,506
You get cold feet?


953
01:24:11,644 --> 01:24:14,847
You decide
you're better off here after all?


954
01:24:15,648 --> 01:24:19,775
You figure it's more comfy


955
01:24:19,902 --> 01:24:24,362
here in the old hopeless emptiness
after all, huh?


956
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:29,275
Oh, wow, that did it. Look at his face.


957
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:31,618
What's the matter, Wheeler?
Am I getting warm?


958
01:24:31,789 --> 01:24:35,122
All right, Son. I think we'd better be...
- You know something?


959
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:38,127
I wouldn't be surprised
if he knocked her up on purpose


960
01:24:38,295 --> 01:24:41,913
just so he could spend the rest of his
life hiding behind a maternity dress.


961
01:24:42,049 --> 01:24:45,252
That way he'd never have to find out
what he's really made of.


962
01:24:45,385 --> 01:24:48,968
Now look, I think that's just about
enough out of you.


963
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,881
I mean, who the hell
do you think you are?


964
01:24:52,017 --> 01:24:53,392
You come in here and say


965
01:24:53,519 --> 01:24:57,130
whatever crazy goddamn thing
comes into your head,


966
01:24:56,647 --> 01:24:59,897
and I think it's about time somebody told
you to keep your goddamn mouth shut.


967
01:25:00,025 --> 01:25:02,979
He's not well, Frank.
- Not well, my ass!


968
01:25:03,278 --> 01:25:06,979
I don't give a damn
if he's sick or well or dead or alive,


969
01:25:07,115 --> 01:25:08,740
he should keep his fucking opinions


970
01:25:08,867 --> 01:25:12,318
in the fucking insane asylum
where they belong!


971
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:17,746
Let's go, Son.
- Come on, John.


972
01:25:22,214 --> 01:25:24,919
Big man you got there, April.


973
01:25:25,551 --> 01:25:27,508
Big family man.


974
01:25:31,223 --> 01:25:33,180
I feel sorry for you.


975
01:25:35,895 --> 01:25:39,346
Still, maybe you deserve each other.


976
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:44,108
I mean, the way you look right now,
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too.


977
01:25:45,696 --> 01:25:48,021
You must give him a pretty bad time


978
01:25:48,157 --> 01:25:52,024
if making babies is the only way
he can prove he's got a pair of balls.


979
01:25:52,328 --> 01:25:56,871
You fucking...
- No! He's not well, Frank!


980
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,170
All right, John.
Let's get on out to the car now.


981
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:20,890
April, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.


982
01:26:21,065 --> 01:26:25,643
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry!


983
01:26:25,777 --> 01:26:28,695
Ma, have I said
"I'm sorry" enough times?


984
01:26:28,822 --> 01:26:31,064
Damn! I am sorry, too.


985
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,070
I bet I'm just about
the sorriest bastard I know.


986
01:26:34,244 --> 01:26:38,324
But get right down to it, I don't have
a whole hell of a lot to be glad about.


987
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:39,536
Do I?


988
01:26:42,294 --> 01:26:44,203
But, hey, you know what?


989
01:26:45,589 --> 01:26:47,582
I am glad about one thing.


990
01:26:48,258 --> 01:26:50,500
You want to know what I'm glad about?


991
01:26:52,971 --> 01:26:55,545
I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid.


992
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:16,609
Okay, okay, don't tell me.


993
01:27:17,246 --> 01:27:19,285
Don't tell me, let me guess.


994
01:27:19,957 --> 01:27:23,960
I made a disgusting spectacle
of myself, right?


995
01:27:25,254 --> 01:27:26,285
Right.


996
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:27,964
And everything that man said
is true, right?


997
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:29,875
Is that what you're going to say?


998
01:27:30,008 --> 01:27:32,085
Apparently I don't have to.


999
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:35,136
You're saying it for me.
- Well, you're wrong, April.


1000
01:27:35,305 --> 01:27:38,970
Really? Why am I wrong?
- Because the man is insane.


1001
01:27:39,101 --> 01:27:42,304
He's fucking insane! Do you know what
the definition of insanity is?


1002
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:43,552
No. Do you?


1003
01:27:43,689 --> 01:27:47,140
Yes, it's the inability
to relate to another human being.


1004
01:27:47,276 --> 01:27:49,315
It's the inability to love.


1005
01:27:54,366 --> 01:27:56,987
April. April.


1006
01:27:57,661 --> 01:28:00,330
April! April!


1007
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:04,661
The inability... The inability to love.


1008
01:28:06,545 --> 01:28:10,390
Frank. You really are a wonderful talker.


1009
01:28:09,631 --> 01:28:12,917
If black could be made into white
by talking,


1010
01:28:13,051 --> 01:28:15,009
you'd be the man for the job.


1011
01:28:15,179 --> 01:28:17,634
So now I'm crazy
because I don't love you. Right?


1012
01:28:17,765 --> 01:28:19,804
Is that the point?
- No. Wrong.


1013
01:28:19,933 --> 01:28:23,848
You're not crazy and you do love me.
That's the point, April.


1014
01:28:24,355 --> 01:28:27,521
But I don't. I hate you.


1015
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:30,855
You were just some boy
who made me laugh at a party once


1016
01:28:31,028 --> 01:28:34,230
and now I loathe the sight of you.


1017
01:28:34,072 --> 01:28:37,607
In fact, if you come any closer,
if you touch me or anything,


1018
01:28:37,743 --> 01:28:39,534
I think I'll scream.


1019
01:28:40,871 --> 01:28:42,863
Come on. Stop this, April.


1020
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,378
Fuck you, April!


1021
01:28:50,505 --> 01:28:53,875
Fuck you and all your hateful,
snotty little...


1022
01:28:54,009 --> 01:28:56,678
What're you going to do now?
Are you going to hit me?


1023
01:28:56,804 --> 01:28:59,805
To show me how much you love me?
- Don't worry, I can't be bothered!


1024
01:29:00,015 --> 01:29:02,636
You're not worth the trouble
it would take to hit you.


1025
01:29:02,768 --> 01:29:05,389
You're not worth the powder
it would take to blow you up.


1026
01:29:05,563 --> 01:29:09,809
You're an empty, empty,
hollow shell of a woman!


1027
01:29:10,943 --> 01:29:14,893
What the hell are you doing in my house
if you hate me so much?


1028
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:17,737
Why the hell are you married to me?


1029
01:29:17,866 --> 01:29:20,701
What the hell are you doing
carrying my child?


1030
01:29:20,828 --> 01:29:24,370
I mean, why didn't you just get
rid of it when you had the chance?


1031
01:29:23,622 --> 01:29:26,576
Because listen to me.
Listen to me, I got news for you.


1032
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:28,873
I wish to God that you had.


1033
01:30:02,995 --> 01:30:04,193
April!


1034
01:30:06,874 --> 01:30:08,036
April!


1035
01:30:12,754 --> 01:30:13,917
April!


1036
01:30:19,344 --> 01:30:20,990
April!


1037
01:30:25,768 --> 01:30:26,930
April!


1038
01:30:28,854 --> 01:30:29,969
April!


1039
01:30:38,197 --> 01:30:40,070
April!
- Stay away from me.


1040
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,233
April, listen.
- Stay away from me.


1041
01:30:42,367 --> 01:30:44,241
Can't I even get away from you
in the fucking woods?


1042
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:46,327
April, listen, I didn't mean that.


1043
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:48,780
Honestly, I didn't mean what I said.
- Are you still talking?


1044
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:51,668
Isn't there any way to stop your talking?


1045
01:30:52,378 --> 01:30:55,912
I need to think. Can't you see that?
I need to think.


1046
01:30:58,383 --> 01:31:00,127
Please come back to the house.
What're you doing out here, April?


1047
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,802
Do you want me to scream again,
Frank?


1048
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:04,087
Because I will! I mean it!


1049
01:31:12,815 --> 01:31:15,222
Okay. Okay.


1050
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:49,989
Good morning.


1051
01:34:52,117 --> 01:34:53,576
Good morning.


1052
01:34:55,371 --> 01:34:57,992
Would you like
scrambled eggs or fried?


1053
01:35:02,962 --> 01:35:04,504
I don't know.


1054
01:35:05,297 --> 01:35:10,338
It doesn't really matter.
Scrambled, I guess, if it's easy.


1055
01:35:11,136 --> 01:35:14,090
Fine. I'll have scrambled, too.


1056
01:36:12,072 --> 01:36:16,500
It's kind of nice having breakfast
without the kids for a change, huh?


1057
01:36:16,535 --> 01:36:17,650
Yes.


1058
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:22,310
I thought you'd probably want
a good breakfast today.


1059
01:36:21,623 --> 01:36:24,827
I mean, it's kind of an important day
for you, isn't it?


1060
01:36:25,711 --> 01:36:29,210
Isn't this the day you have
your conference with Pollock?


1061
01:36:31,383 --> 01:36:33,625
Yes. Yes, that's right.


1062
01:36:35,721 --> 01:36:39,588
Big deal.
- I imagine it is a pretty big deal.


1063
01:36:40,309 --> 01:36:42,017
For them, anyway.


1064
01:36:43,312 --> 01:36:46,930
What exactly do you think
you'll be doing in your new job?


1065
01:36:47,358 --> 01:36:50,109
You haven't really
told me much about it.


1066
01:36:50,986 --> 01:36:52,361
Haven't I?


1067
01:36:54,573 --> 01:36:56,732
Well, I think this whole thing
is about Knox getting ready


1068
01:36:56,867 --> 01:37:00,117
to buy up one of those
really big computers,


1069
01:37:00,245 --> 01:37:02,321
even bigger than the 500.


1070
01:37:03,374 --> 01:37:06,707
Didn't I tell you about that?
- No.


1071
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:09,520
Why don't you tell me now?


1072
01:37:13,759 --> 01:37:14,790
Well,


1073
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:20,632
you know, basically it's just a big,
fast adding machine.


1074
01:37:22,351 --> 01:37:26,016
Only, instead of mechanical parts,
you see,


1075
01:37:26,772 --> 01:37:32,063
you've got thousands
of individual vacuum tubes.


1076
01:37:42,955 --> 01:37:44,153
I see.


1077
01:37:52,047 --> 01:37:54,040
At least I think I see.


1078
01:37:57,928 --> 01:38:00,929
Yes, it's really kind of interesting,
isn't it?


1079
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,392
Well, I don't know.


1080
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:10,599
Yeah, I guess it is kind of interesting,
in a way.


1081
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:17,983
You should value what you do, Frank.


1082
01:38:19,283 --> 01:38:22,000
You're obviously good at it.


1083
01:38:36,884 --> 01:38:40,050
Well, I guess
I'd better be getting started, huh?


1084
01:38:46,977 --> 01:38:49,266
Listen, though, April, the...


1085
01:38:51,398 --> 01:38:53,142
This was really nice.


1086
01:38:54,818 --> 01:38:57,855
I mean, it was a swell breakfast.
Really, I...


1087
01:38:58,781 --> 01:39:02,066
I don't know when I've ever had
a nicer breakfast.


1088
01:39:04,369 --> 01:39:08,237
Thank you. I enjoyed it, too.


1089
01:39:30,062 --> 01:39:34,142
Then you don't...
You don't hate me or anything?


1090
01:39:36,818 --> 01:39:41,230
No. No, of course I don't.


1091
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:52,869
Have a good day.


1092
01:39:59,675 --> 01:40:03,376
Okay, then. So long.


1093
01:41:45,656 --> 01:41:50,152
Hello. Milly? Everything all right?


1094
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:57,074
Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling
any better. That's really why I called.


1095
01:41:58,669 --> 01:42:02,713
If it's not an inconvenience for you,
this evening would be great.


1096
01:42:03,757 --> 01:42:04,753
What?


1097
01:42:07,511 --> 01:42:13,090
Oh, no. No.
Not if they're outdoors playing.


1098
01:42:13,726 --> 01:42:14,721
No.


1099
01:42:16,812 --> 01:42:18,852
Don't call them in.


1100
01:42:18,981 --> 01:42:23,310
Just give them each a kiss for me,


1101
01:42:24,945 --> 01:42:26,818
and tell them I...


1102
01:42:28,532 --> 01:42:29,991
Tell them...


1103
01:42:31,326 --> 01:42:37,163
You know. All right. All right.
Thank you, Milly. Bye.


1104
01:46:09,044 --> 01:46:11,749
I think I need help.


1105
01:46:13,298 --> 01:46:17,213
115 Revolutionary Road.


1106
01:46:44,121 --> 01:46:46,873
Frank. They tell you what happened?
- Jesus Christ.


1107
01:46:46,999 --> 01:46:50,300
Shep, I didn't understand
half the things he told me.


1108
01:46:49,627 --> 01:46:52,378
He said the foetus was out
before they got her here.


1109
01:46:52,504 --> 01:46:57,166
And they had to operate to take out
the, what do you call it, the placenta?


1110
01:46:57,301 --> 01:46:59,589
And now she's still bleeding.


1111
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:02,389
He said that she'd lost a lot of blood
before the ambulance came,


1112
01:47:02,514 --> 01:47:04,887
and now they're trying to stop it.


1113
01:47:05,142 --> 01:47:10,110
He said a whole lot of things
I didn't understand about capillaries...


1114
01:47:10,231 --> 01:47:14,560
He said that she's unconscious. Jesus.


1115
01:47:14,693 --> 01:47:16,520
Okay, Frank,
why don't you just take a seat?


1116
01:47:16,653 --> 01:47:18,979
What the hell do I want to sit down for,
for God's sake?


1117
01:47:19,114 --> 01:47:23,242
Okay, Frank. Just take it easy.
Take it easy.


1118
01:47:25,704 --> 01:47:29,120
Frank, have a cigarette.
- She did it to herself, Shep.


1119
01:47:31,126 --> 01:47:33,035
She did it to herself.


1120
01:47:40,677 --> 01:47:42,884
I'm gonna get you some coffee.


1121
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:57,330
They were such wonderful people.
Weren't they, Shep?


1122
01:48:58,213 --> 01:49:02,875
It's just devastating. Poor April.


1123
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:04,290
Thank you.


1124
01:49:05,554 --> 01:49:08,970
Frank lives in the city now.
Where is it that he works?


1125
01:49:10,059 --> 01:49:12,514
Bart Pollock Associates.
- Computers?


1126
01:49:13,854 --> 01:49:15,728
Interesting firm.


1127
01:49:15,856 --> 01:49:19,106
Have you seen him since?
- No. Not back here.


1128
01:49:19,234 --> 01:49:24,220
There are too many memories, I think.
Shep has seen him in the city.


1129
01:49:23,614 --> 01:49:26,270
Haven't you, sweetie?


1130
01:49:26,074 --> 01:49:29,159
Frank is just devoted to those kids.


1131
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:33,115
Every spare moment he has,
he spends with them.


1132
01:49:48,347 --> 01:49:49,627
Excuse me.


1133
01:50:00,943 --> 01:50:02,770
You all right?


1134
01:50:07,866 --> 01:50:11,069
I don't want to talk
about the Wheelers any more.


1135
01:50:12,663 --> 01:50:13,694
Okay.


1136
01:50:16,041 --> 01:50:17,749
We don't have to.


1137
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:21,378
We don't have to.


1138
01:51:03,547 --> 01:51:06,252
Daddy, Daddy, watch. Watch, Daddy.


1139
01:51:12,306 --> 01:51:13,966
<i>I can't tell you how pleased I am</i>


1140
01:51:14,099 --> 01:51:17,266
<i>about the little Revolutionary Road</i>
<i>place, Howard.</i>


1141
01:51:17,728 --> 01:51:20,646
And now whenever I drive past,
it gives me such a lift


1142
01:51:20,773 --> 01:51:24,355
to see it all perked up
and spanking clean again.


1143
01:51:24,985 --> 01:51:27,358
All the lights in all the windows.


1144
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:32,652
And do you know? I was just thinking,
I've loved that little house for years.


1145
01:51:32,784 --> 01:51:37,245
And the Braces are the only really
suitable people I've ever found for it.


1146
01:51:37,873 --> 01:51:40,660
Really nice, congenial people, I mean.


1147
01:51:40,793 --> 01:51:44,020
Well, except for the Wheelers,
you mean.


1148
01:51:45,506 --> 01:51:47,878
I was very fond of the Wheelers.


1149
01:51:48,759 --> 01:51:52,175
They were a bit whimsical for my taste.
A bit neurotic.


1150
01:51:53,347 --> 01:51:54,627
I never stressed it, but they were often


1151
01:51:54,765 --> 01:51:57,884
very trying people
to deal with, in many ways.


1152
01:51:59,228 --> 01:52:03,973
And actually, the main reason
that the little house was so hard to sell


1153
01:52:04,149 --> 01:52:07,233
was because they let it depreciate
so dreadfully.


1154
01:52:07,361 --> 01:52:12,984
Warped window frames, wet cellar,
crayon marks all over the walls,


1155
01:52:13,117 --> 01:52:16,071
filthy smudges around the door knobs
and the fixtures...


1156
01:54:21,197 --> 01:54:22,239
