2
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,882
<i>Call from Madison Weld.</i>

3
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,960
Hello.

4
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,644
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

5
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,086
What? Huh?

6
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,286
<i>Daddy, it's me, Madison. Hi!</i>

7
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,524
Oh, yeah. Hey.

8
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,681
How are you doing?

9
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,207
<i>I'm doing wonderful.
Turkmenistan is so beautiful.</i>

10
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,090
<i>I'm sorry I haven't called.
How are you?</i>

11
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,209
Oh, I'm, you know, fine.

12
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,361
I'm okay.

13
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,168
<i>Has Hunter been coming around?</i>

14
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,480
Hunter?

15
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,687
<i>Dad?</i>

16
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,891
<i>Connection lost.</i>

17
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,486
Madison.

18
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,921
Hmm.

19
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,401
Hey, Frank.

20
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,166
Hey, there.
How are you doing?

21
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,006
I'm fine.

22
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,765
Just killing time, waiting
for my one and only patron.

23
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,005
Mr Darcy does
all the real work, anyway.

24
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,809
So, what'll it be, the usual?

25
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,962
Well, I came for the books,

26
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,050
but I'd be more interested
in getting your phone number.

27
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,528
All right, let's see
if we can't find something

28
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,410
that you haven't read
three times already.

29
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,245
<i>Good afternoon, Jennifer.</i>

30
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,849
<i>Might I help you
with something?</i>

31
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,604
No, thank you, Mr Darcy.

32
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,806
<i>Very well.</i>

33
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,242
<i>I will resume book relocation.</i>

34
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,282
Damn. I'm not going to be duct
taping books much longer.

35
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,761
Why?

36
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,970
Um... A new non-profit
is taking over the library

37
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,806
and they want to reimagine
the modern library experience.

38
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,567
So we're going to be retro-cool.

39
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,166
<i>Call from Hunter Weld.</i>

40
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,643
Is that your son, Hunter?

41
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,960
What?

42
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,610
Your son, Hunter.

43
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,690
Yes, that's my son.

44
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,251
Dad.

45
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,721
<i>Dad.</i>

46
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,926
Hello.

47
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,166
No.

48
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,370
No. I'm going
to eat at Harry's.

49
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,521
<i>Dad, Harry's closed.</i>

50
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,887
What are you talking about?
I ate here last week...

51
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,007
<i>Dad?</i>

52
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,121
<i>Dad.</i>

53
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,602
Hey. I told you to stop coming in here.
What did you take?

54
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,920
I was just looking
for some candles.

55
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,004
If I see you shoplifting
again, I am calling the cops.

56
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,366
Who is responsible for you?

57
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,451
Did you take a fizzy bath
bomb, you son of a bitch?

58
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,126
Pass me. Pass me.

59
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,207
Dad.

60
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,044
You're right
in the middle of the road.

61
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,091
I thought we agreed you'd
wait for me to drive you.

62
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,207
Hunter.

63
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,850
You're going to get clipped
by a car coming around here.

64
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,810
What cars? We're in the
middle of the woods out here.

65
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,803
You know, I saw a
bobcat the other day.

66
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,281
Okay, would you
just get in, please?

67
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,244
Oh, what the hell is this?

68
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,688
It's one of Isaac's toys.
Just get in.

69
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,684
If you keep buying your kids
crap like this,

70
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,448
you're going to
spoil them rotten.

71
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,850
You in?
Yeah.

72
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,641
- Why?
- 'Cause then they can spend

73
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,960
their allowance
on whatever they want.

74
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,246
It teaches them
fiscal responsibility.

75
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,800
It teaches them
to be spoiled brats.

76
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,600
They get a choice.
They can save their money

77
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,244
or they can not save their money.
It's up to them.

78
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,243
But only if they get four gold
stars and no frowny faces.

79
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,403
I didn't buy you useless crap.
You turned out okay.

80
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,569
How's Princeton, Mr Big Shot?

81
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,211
Princeton? Dad, that
was 15 years ago.

82
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,682
Jesus Christ.
Look at this place.

83
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,881
How do you do this in aweek?

84
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,888
Sometimes it's better
a little dusty.

85
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,564
Dusty would be an improvement.

86
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,369
This is gross.
This is just gross.

87
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,965
It's better than prison.

88
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,088
Cute. That, you remember.

89
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,924
There's nothing wrong
with my memory.

90
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,970
To be continued.

91
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,326
Excuse me.

92
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,765
Yep. I'm here.

93
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,567
I know. I just got to do this delicately.
He's in a mood.

94
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,729
I'm just... I'm trying to do the right thing.
Maybe he'll like it.

95
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,605
Love you.

96
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,247
Dad.

97
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,961
We gotta talk.

98
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,201
You want money?

99
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,361
What?
Money.

100
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,487
No, no. I don't...

101
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,244
No, no, I...

102
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,641
You have a problem.

103
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,561
You're worse
every time I come up here.

104
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,450
Princeton, Dad? And you thought
Harry's was still open.

105
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,808
I was joking. You're not sending
me to that brain centre.

106
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,368
It's not a brain centre, Dad. It's
a place where they can help you.

107
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,851
But no, that's not it.

108
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,685
I'm fine. I don't need your help.
I'm fine.

109
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,843
Would you listen?
I brought you something.

110
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,009
You have got to be kidding me.

111
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,046
I'm not this pathetic.

112
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,649
I don't need to be spoon-fed
by some goddamn robot.

113
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,564
Dad, it's not like that.
It's new.

114
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,324
It's more like a butler.

115
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,048
You're going to leave me
with this death machine?

116
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,328
What's the problem?
It's a robot.

117
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,171
Hi, Frank. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

118
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,208
How do you know?
All right.

119
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,802
Why don't you go on inside, tidy up, and
cook us whatever food you can find?

120
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,564
Okay, Hunter.

121
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,371
Good to meet you, Frank.
I like your house.

122
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,127
That thing is going to
murder me in my sleep.

123
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,050
Somebody's going to
murder you in your sleep.

124
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,203
What about your mother?

125
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,929
She's not going to want a
robot getting in her way.

126
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,923
Mom's got her own robot.

127
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,607
You know Mom doesn't live
here any more, right?

128
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,444
You've been divorced
for 30 years.

129
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,364
Yeah, I know that.
That's not what I meant.

130
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,524
How can you not
be excited by this?

131
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,249
Where the hell did it get that?

132
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,891
I found a box of cake mix
in the cupboard, Frank.

133
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,610
If you don't mind me saying so,

134
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,409
I think I could be
a big help to you.

135
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,481
What do you say?

136
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,608
Get this hunk of crap
out of my house.

137
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,646
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

138
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,290
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, Dad.
I drive up here every week.

139
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,691
10 hours, round trip.

140
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,165
I don't see my kids.

141
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,885
Forget it. But the robot's
staying because it's expensive,

142
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,041
and you're going
to do what it says

143
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,724
or you are going to end up
in the memory centre.

144
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,770
Because the last thing I need is you dying
all alone up here to be my fault, too.

145
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,285
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

146
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,964
No, of course not.

147
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,841
How the hell do I turn you off?

148
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,481
I'm sorry, Frank, but Hunter has
chosen for me to remain on.

149
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,968
I don't have
an off switch, Frank.

150
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,646
If you let go of me,
I'll do the dishes.

151
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,960
Go ahead.

152
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,650
Wake up, Frank.

153
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,247
It's 7:00, Frank.
Wake up.

154
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,486
Frank, it's crucial that we establish
a set schedule for your day

155
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,528
to help keep you oriented.

156
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,330
Frank, I've reviewed
your medical records.

157
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,121
Are you finding your episodes of
disorientation increasing in frequency?

158
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,043
What the hell are you?

159
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,524
I'm a robot, Frank.

160
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,921
Oh.

161
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,850
Oh, yeah.

162
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,080
How are you doing?

163
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,683
I'm fine, Frank.

164
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,921
Wake up.

165
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,651
Just bring me some cereal.

166
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,882
That cereal is full of
unhealthy ingredients.

167
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,440
I threw it away.
Don't throw away my stuff.

168
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,729
Frank, that cereal is for children.
Enjoy this grapefruit.

169
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,609
You're for children, stupid.

170
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,650
Today, we're going
to start a garden.

171
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,529
Oh, fuck this shit.

172
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,528
Frank, you need a project.

173
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,682
Mental stimulation
plus a regimented schedule

174
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,288
will vastly improve your cognitive functioning.
Besides, it's good exercise.

175
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,607
Frank, we're going to
have to work together.

176
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,489
You are a robot butler.

177
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,566
I'm not a butler, Frank.
I'm a health care aide

178
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,928
programmed to monitor and improve
your physical and mental health.

179
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,923
Yeah? Get out of my house.

180
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,085
If you're not going to cooperate with
me, I might as well not be here.

181
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,446
Fine with me.

182
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,205
If that's the way you feel,
I'll contact Hunter.

183
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,361
Good.

184
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,804
What are you doing?

185
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,280
Do you have a phone up there in that brain?
You calling him?

186
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,930
Look, you heard what he said.

187
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,128
He was trying to put
me into a nuthouse.

188
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,808
I don't recall
Hunter saying that.

189
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,405
There's nothing
wrong with my memory.

190
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,687
I'm fine, I'm telling you.
I'm fine.

191
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,764
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

192
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,161
My memory is fi...
What am I doing?

193
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,808
I'm talking to an appliance.

194
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,882
I suggest you work with me.

195
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,524
I'm not gardening.

196
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,608
Can't you do that super fast?

197
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,648
Some things take time, Frank.

198
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,643
Shit, I hate hikes.
Goddamn bugs.

199
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,410
You see one tree,
you seen them all.

200
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,405
I just hate hikes.

201
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,042
While my programme's goal is to improve
your health, I'm able to adapt my methods.

202
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,283
Would you prefer another
form of moderate exercise?

203
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,285
I would rather die eating cheeseburgers
than live off of steamed cauliflower.

204
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,521
What about me, Frank?

205
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,290
What do you mean,
what about you?

206
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,522
If you die
eating cheeseburgers,

207
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,523
what do you think
happens to me?

208
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,045
I'll have failed.

209
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,522
They'll send me back to the
warehouse and wipe my memory.

210
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,486
If we're going to walk, we might
as well make it worthwhile.

211
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,199
Come on, keep up.

212
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,241
Stop.

213
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,131
If you come in there with me, I'm
going to have a heart attack and die.

214
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,964
But, Frank...
Just stay.

215
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,763
<i>Can I help you
find anything, sir?</i>

216
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,444
Where is the librarian?

217
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,761
<i>I'm not familiar
with that title.</i>

218
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,161
You're worse
than the other one. No.

219
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,527
Where is the librarian?

220
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,602
<i>Jennifer.
She's in her office.</i>

221
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,602
<i>Sir, you are not permitted
in the offices.</i>

222
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,889
Maybe we could create a little something
in honour of Dewey Decimal System.

223
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,610
Frank, you're not
allowed back here.

224
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,603
Hey, there, old-timer.
How are you doing?

225
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,761
How am I doing? I'm Frank.

226
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,085
This is Jake Finn.

227
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,561
He's been filling me in on the plans
for the new library. It's his project.

228
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,689
You must remember the days
when this library

229
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,410
was the only way
to learn about the world.

230
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,720
New library?

231
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,526
We talked about it the other day.
Remember?

232
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,649
I gotta slide. The movers are probably
taking a two-hour lunch break.

233
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,611
Jennifer, I'll be by Thursday to see
how it's coming along. Frank. Frank?

234
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,760
I'd love to talk to you some more about
your history with printed information.

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,606
You're our connection
to the past, buddy.

236
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,486
Who is that little shit?

237
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,289
My grandma has one of these.

238
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,681
Yeah, but this one's sweet.

239
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,131
I heard of these ones.

240
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,009
It's got advanced legs.

241
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,923
Warning. Do not molest me.

242
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,844
What are these assholes doing?

243
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,163
It's okay. The books are going,
but they're going to scan

244
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,289
whatever they don't already have
and then they'll recycle them.

245
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,886
It's like goddamn
Nazi Germany in here.

246
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,646
I know it's upsetting,
but it's okay.

247
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,441
Come on. Let me
show you something.

248
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,522
These will not be recycled.
These are the real deal.

249
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,489
Now, this is our
most valuable book.

250
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,441
Look at that.

251
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,601
Do you get to
keep these, at least?

252
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,205
I wish.

253
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,523
No. They have to be
very carefully preserved.

254
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,366
And they're just too old to be handled any more.
It's really a shame.

255
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,965
It sounds like the same people
who stopped coming here

256
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,405
want to take away what's yours.

257
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,686
No, they're not
the ones that left.

258
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,491
They're just kids that think
books are cool again.

259
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,087
Mmm. That's a beautiful one.

260
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,531
Hey! Beat it,
you little bastards!

261
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,562
What's the matter, you can harass
old men, but you can't handle kids?

262
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,086
I told them to stop,
but they wouldn't listen.

263
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,561
The next time that happens,
just say,

264
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,927
"Self-destruct sequence
initialised."

265
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,401
And then start
counting down from 10.

266
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,888
Why would I do that, Frank?

267
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,369
Let's go to Harry's.

268
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,401
Have you smelled
our lavender heart soaps?

269
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,409
We should be going, Frank.

270
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,687
What a cute little
helper you have.

271
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,366
What is in your pocket?

272
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,445
I'm sorry, young lady.
I couldn't quite hear you.

273
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,922
What is in your pocket? I'm going
to make a citizen's arrest.

274
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,571
Nothing. Nothing's
in my pockets. Look.

275
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,766
Frank.

276
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,286
It's time we head home.

277
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,887
Yeah.

278
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,528
If you'll excuse us, ladies.

279
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,443
Nice to see you.

280
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,605
Have a good one.

281
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,208
Listen, you don't have
to argue with me.

282
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,328
I'm stuck with the damn thing.

283
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,607
Did you talk to your brother?

284
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,604
She doesn't like you.
I don't like you, either.

285
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,245
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,766
It is creepy.
He's cramping my style.

287
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,601
No. By all means, go ahead.
You let him have it.

288
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,086
Yeah. Bye.

289
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,971
Well, looks like maybe you're
going to be out of my hair soon.

290
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,283
Is your daughter politically
aligned against robot labour?

291
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,250
Hey, where did this come from?

292
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,210
From the store.

293
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,847
Remember?

294
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,730
Yeah, of course I remember, but
what did you do? Did you...

295
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,484
You put this in here?
You took this?

296
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,607
I saw you had it,

297
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,524
but the shopkeeper distracted
you and you forgot it.

298
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,204
I took it for you.

299
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,167
Did I do something
wrong, Frank?

300
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,286
Come on.

301
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,844
You know what stealing is?

302
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,922
The act of a person who steals.

303
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,526
Taking property without
permission or right.

304
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,045
Yeah, I guess.

305
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,881
You stole this.

306
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,648
How do you feel about that?

307
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,722
I don't have any
thoughts on that.

308
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,049
They didn't program you
about stealing,

309
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,202
shoplifting, robbery?

310
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,171
I have working definitions for those terms.
I don't understand.

311
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,605
Do you want something
for dessert?

312
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,401
Do you have any programming
that makes you obey the law?

313
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,121
Do you want me to incorporate state and
federal law directly into my programming?

314
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,487
No, you leave it as it is.

315
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,884
You're starting to grow on me.

316
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,121
Thank you, Frank.

317
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,486
It's time for your enema.

318
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,885
Okay. Let's see
what you can do.

319
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,049
Any lock in the world
is just a little puzzle.

320
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,521
And the only key is the key.

321
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,843
No lock is perfect and
any lock can be picked.

322
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,729
All you need is...

323
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,166
...time.

324
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,124
Okay, your turn.

325
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,685
I think this hobby would be more
beneficial for you than me, Frank.

326
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,682
Teaching you is the hobby.

327
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,565
Okay, go.

328
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,685
You know, I did six years for one
stretch and then I did 10 for another.

329
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,889
I did know that, but Hunter
told me not to mention it.

330
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,329
According to your file, you were first
arrested for possessing stolen goods,

331
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,050
and then tax evasion.

332
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,806
That tax evasion rap was garbage.
I was a second-storey man.

333
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,961
What's that?

334
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,442
Finding away in
where no way in exists.

335
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,330
Like climbing up
to the second storey.

336
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,607
I specialised in jewellery.
Diamonds.

337
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,770
You want the most
value by the ounce

338
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,164
when you're rappelling down a 50-storey
casino in the middle of a hurricane.

339
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,529
And the women back then.

340
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,084
The most value by the ounce?

341
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,687
I always went high-end.
That way, nobody gets hurt.

342
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,489
Except for the insurance
company crooks.

343
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,641
That was your best time yet.

344
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,490
I'm getting the hang of it.

345
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,769
We're going to clean up.

346
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,603
I thought you said
the library was closed, Frank.

347
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,887
This is what
they call "casing."

348
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,045
To your right.

349
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,085
Oh, Frank, the library's
closed for renovations.

350
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,444
Oh. Well, we were
just taking a walk

351
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,249
and I thought we'd
stop by and say hello.

352
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,731
Hello.
Hi.

353
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,526
Is this your new robot?

354
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,731
Yes, it is.

355
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,844
Hey, there. I'm Jennifer.
What's your name?

356
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,326
I don't have a name.

357
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,731
Oh, Frank, you have to name it.

358
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,208
This is Mr Darcy.
He's my helper.

359
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,329
Avery reliable model.

360
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,126
Thank you.

361
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,410
I'm glad you're here,
Frank. All this change.

362
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,006
It doesn't feel like
home here any more.

363
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,689
What's the point of a library if
you can't check out the books?

364
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,809
It's all about
augmented reality stuff now.

365
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,164
Jake says it's about
the library experience.

366
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,971
When people can get any book,
anytime, any place, instantly,

367
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,206
this building
is about community now.

368
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,003
Community. Yeah, right.

369
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,401
Jake?

370
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,407
They're going to have this big
fundraiser party-thing on Friday

371
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,723
and all the young, hoity-toity
couples are going to come.

372
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,847
It sounds awful.

373
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,968
Yeah. Do you want
to come with me?

374
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,447
Yes.

375
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,367
Cool.

376
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,368
See that? A magnetic alarm that
trips when the door opens.

377
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,681
And there, a night-vision
security camera.

378
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,683
It's simple,
but it's effective.

379
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,731
Frank, you don't have any free
activity time scheduled after sunset.

380
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,367
What?

381
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,450
It's just one night.

382
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,000
And what's the point
of an arbitrary schedule?

383
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,051
The schedule is the most important part.
It helps you remain oriented.

384
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,849
Can we do it during the day?

385
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,526
No. The whole point is
not to be seen.

386
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,171
We have to be quiet.
It's got to be dark.

387
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,208
We gotta sneak in.

388
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,242
I don't know if I can sneak.

389
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,321
Hunter brought you here
to help me,

390
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,721
but I don't need
that kind of help.

391
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,001
You want to be partners?
Let's be partners.

392
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,289
You said yourself,
I need a project.

393
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,887
I do. I need something to keep me
stimulated, to keep me exercised.

394
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,450
Look, this is it.

395
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,605
Okay, Frank.

396
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,007
Okay.

397
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,251
<i>Call from Hunter Weld.</i>

398
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,288
Oh, why is he calling?

399
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,566
<i>Call from Hunter Weld.</i>

400
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,244
Did you call him?

401
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,367
No.

402
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,769
<i>Call from Hunter Weld.</i>

403
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,406
Hello.

404
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,330
<i>Dad, call off
your dogs, all right?</i>

405
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,606
<i>I'm not changing my mind.</i>

406
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,523
What? What are you
talking about?

407
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,924
Dad, Madison won't stop calling me with
all these Human Movement talking points.

408
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,647
Deal with her yourself.

409
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,007
<i>What? No, no, no.
This is not going to work.</i>

410
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,447
<i>The robot is staying.
I can't keep coming up there.</i>

411
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,363
Nobody's asking you to.

412
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,090
<i>This is ridiculous.
A robot caretaker</i>

413
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,084
<i>is just as humane as a human caretaker.
'Cause they're more efficient...</i>

414
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,321
<i>Hunter, I don't care... it
doesn't make them inhumane.</i>

415
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,488
<i>All right, well, she said that you said
you were saying that the robot is...</i>

416
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,800
The robot's fine.

417
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,531
Just go do something
nice with your kids.

418
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,690
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

419
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,681
<i>Would you tell her to stop bugging me, please?
We're on vacation.</i>

420
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,205
<i>All right. Bye.
All right, bye.</i>

421
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,001
You're not telling Hunter anything
about the locks, are you?

422
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,567
Developing trust
is part of my programme.

423
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,610
I can keep anything that you feel
is important between just us.

424
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,921
Perfect.
Keep your mouth shut.

425
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,410
Not a word about
anything to anybody.

426
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,767
Wait.

427
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,881
Eureka.

428
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,046
Wait here.

429
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,409
This reminds me of a job
I did in South Florida.

430
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,407
It was probably a bad idea,
scaling that high-rise,

431
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,881
but I was involved with this
knockout redhead at the time.

432
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,361
I can't remember
her name. Okay.

433
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,087
Okay.

434
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,884
Let's see what we got here.

435
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,330
This kind of stuff
used to be solid gold to me.

436
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,322
I never got caught because I understood
building plans better than anybody else.

437
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,687
My family thought
I was a maintenance man.

438
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,561
It's open.

439
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,131
Which book do you want?

440
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,407
<i>Jane Eyre? Don Quixote?</i>

441
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,960
Take whatever's most valuable
by the ounce.

442
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,847
But I really was
a maintenance man.

443
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,285
Because I couldn't
spend the money.

444
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,931
I had two toolboxes, my work
tools and my other tools.

445
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,890
And I taught Hunter how to
fix just about anything.

446
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,084
We're supposed
to be quiet, Frank.

447
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,889
What?

448
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,889
Why are you wearing
a space helmet?

449
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,883
Frank, we need to leave.

450
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,643
Yeah, I know. I know.

451
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,969
That was more dangerous
than you led me to believe, Frank.

452
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,166
Oh...

453
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,120
Jennifer's just going
to love this.

454
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,328
Frank, it's time to go to bed.

455
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,966
You know what you are?
You're no fun.

456
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,370
You were crackerjack
at those locks, though.

457
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,050
I never could show Hunter
how to do that stuff.

458
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,007
I wanted to.
I wanted to.

459
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,010
But I never did.

460
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,768
He was a little hellraiser.

461
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,842
He burned a hole in the carpet.

462
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,329
Or was that Madison?

463
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,845
I read about it.

464
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,688
They used to send me letters.

465
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,962
Frank, it's very late.

466
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,405
Do you remember?

467
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,006
Was that you
or was that your sister?

468
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,970
I missed so much.

469
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,604
When I came home,

470
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,086
I thought you were
the neighbour's kid.

471
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,371
Why does that matter?

472
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,761
You know what? I don't even
mind this stuff any more.

473
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,763
I'm too busy
planning our next job.

474
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,287
Where should we hit next? The MoMA?
The Guggenheim?

475
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,249
<i>Call from Madison Weld.</i>

476
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,367
Maddy, my girl!

477
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,646
<i>Dad, are you there?</i>

478
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,121
Oh, you look pretty.
Where are you now?

479
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,283
<i>Daddy, Hunter is claiming that
you're now fine with the robot</i>

480
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,044
<i>and that you want it
controlling your life.</i>

481
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,691
Oh, no. No, no. Slow down, honey.
Wait a minute.

482
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,921
<i>Seriously,
what was he thinking,</i>

483
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,968
<i>just leaving you there
with this thing?</i>

484
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,520
Look, I told him that he comes
around to see me too much.

485
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,841
So...

486
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,083
<i>Too much? Daddy, he has
abandoned you with a machine.</i>

487
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,209
Yeah, well, you know...

488
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,725
At least he did something.

489
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,004
<i>I'm sorry. I'm travelling.</i>

490
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,127
<i>This is what I do for a living.</i>

491
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,726
I know, sweetie. I'm sorry.

492
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,564
I didn't mean it that way.

493
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,929
<i>Dad, time's running out on this thing.
I'm going to go, okay?</i>

494
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,801
<i>Bye.</i>

495
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,731
I'm back.
How are you holding up?

496
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,370
Well, it's free booze.

497
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,325
Are you okay?

498
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,482
Actually, I'm not supposed
to say anything,

499
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,961
but somebody broke into
the library last night.

500
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,644
It's funny you should say that.

501
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,327
It's almost as if they sensed our
vulnerability. It's horrible.

502
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,403
Jake thinks that maybe
they were trying to hack

503
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,006
into the new donor information.

504
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,051
I don't know.

505
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,289
Oh. You brought
your little friend.

506
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,966
Hi, there.

507
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,451
Where's Mr Darcy?
Mr Darcy.

508
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,770
Are you two enjoying the party?

509
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,525
<i>I'm functioning normally.</i>

510
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,806
As am I.

511
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,804
Why don't you mingle together?

512
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,723
<i>I have no functions or tasks</i>

513
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,804
<i>that require verbal
interaction with the VGC-60L.</i>

514
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,803
Mr Darcy, that is so rude.

515
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,609
So, when all humans are extinct

516
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,524
you're not going to
start a robot society?

517
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,409
I don't understand, Frank.

518
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,326
Why don't you pretend that Mr
Darcy is a human being like me

519
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,402
and start up a conversation?

520
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,722
Hi, there.
How are you doing?

521
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,770
<i>I'm functioning normally.</i>

522
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,046
As am I.

523
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,561
There they are.

524
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,680
Enjoying yourselves?

525
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,240
I wanted to introduce my wife, Ava.
This is Jennifer.

526
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,401
It's so nice to meet you.

527
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,891
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

528
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,769
Jake is so excited
you're staying on.

529
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,970
Why, I...
I love this old place.

530
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,486
I can't believe we all
overlooked it before.

531
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,766
Except you, Frank.

532
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,766
You're so square, you're
practically avant-garde.

533
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,928
What the hell did
you just say to me?

534
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,368
You're so crazy, Frank.

535
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,205
You don't mind if I borrow
Madame Librarian for a moment?

536
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,090
I want to introduce her
to some elite donors.

537
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,646
Ladies.

538
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,926
You shouldn't be drinking those, Frank.
It's not good for gout.

539
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,570
I don't have goddamn gout.

540
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,688
You don't have gout. Yet.

541
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,206
You just keep that
book out of sight.

542
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,487
I don't know
what I was thinking.

543
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,405
Hey, Frank.
What?

544
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,729
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

545
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,007
Is it about
printed information?

546
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,481
Were you ever in prison?

547
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,130
Have you been googling me?

548
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,806
No. It's just...

549
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,406
Do you wear reading glasses?

550
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,050
No, I don't. Why?

551
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,802
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
come around here any more.

552
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,726
Excuse me.

553
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,966
Thank you.

554
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,163
So, that wasn't such a bad
party once you start drinking.

555
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,642
How do you know this whole
thing isn't just one big scam?

556
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,127
What?

557
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,567
What if this guy, Jake,
isn't who he says he is?

558
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,883
Look at all these donations coming in.
These people are loaded.

559
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,884
And look at all the
gowns and the jewels.

560
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,368
That's a little far-fetched,
don't you think?

561
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,171
He's settled down here.
He's not a con man.

562
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,479
Frank?

563
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,844
Okay, next.

564
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,882
Couldn't you get any closer?

565
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,485
How's this, Frank?

566
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,562
Boy, you got some memory.

567
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,366
I wish I could do that.

568
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,607
Flashy shit is back in style.

569
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,202
I'm sorry, Frank, but I can't agree
to let you risk another burglary.

570
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,647
Let's focus
on the garden instead.

571
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,441
Look, the library was strictly
a smash-and-grab job.

572
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,322
Smash and grab? You didn't
even give Jennifer the book.

573
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,125
I'll give it to her
some othertime.

574
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,884
Maybe I'll invite her over
for dinner or something.

575
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,010
Meanwhile, going after one of these rich
yuppies, it's a whole different story.

576
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,525
You can't predict that, Frank.

577
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,921
Isn't this something
you're supposed to encourage?

578
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,641
Without the library job,
I'd just be down in the dumps,

579
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,370
watching you dig up my lawn.

580
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,523
Instead, I'm at a party
with a beautiful woman.

581
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,004
I don't want to
lose that again.

582
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,201
Maybe we can just do the casing
portion as a research project.

583
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,160
And if I've covered everything so
that it's basically zero risk?

584
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,447
You would have to be
very thorough, Frank.

585
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,490
I'm a strict judge.

586
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,641
Okay.

587
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,681
Okay.

588
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,970
I know exactly who the
first mark is going to be.

589
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,285
What a maroon.

590
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,567
How come you didn't have anything
to say to that other robot?

591
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,802
I do what I'm programmed to do.

592
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,608
Were you programmed
to have this conversation

593
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,570
or to work in a garden
or to pick locks?

594
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,808
All of those things are in
service of my main programme.

595
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,042
What about when you said
that I had to eat healthy

596
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,487
because you didn't
want your memory erased?

597
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,803
I think there's something more
going on in that noggin of yours.

598
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,167
I only said that to coerce you.

599
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,766
You lied?

600
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,888
Your health supersedes
my other directives.

601
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,563
The truth is, I don't care if
my memory is erased or not.

602
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,286
But how can you not care
about something like that?

603
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,523
Think about it this way.
You know that you're alive.

604
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,886
You think, therefore you are.

605
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,486
No, that's philosophy.

606
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,609
In a similar way,
I know that I'm not alive.

607
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,761
I'm a robot.

608
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,164
I don't want to talk about how you don't exist.
It's making me uncomfortable.

609
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,769
Unbelievable.

610
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,210
Hello.

611
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,320
Yeah? Hello.

612
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,251
Frank, it's me.

613
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,804
What's going on in there?

614
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,769
Uh, nothing, nothing.

615
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,126
Hey, how are you doing?

616
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,440
I'm fine.

617
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,843
Um, I came for dinner.

618
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,240
Remember?

619
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,926
Oh, yeah. I didn't forget.

620
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,767
I'm working on it. Why don't
you come back a little later?

621
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,087
I can't believe
I'm still doing this.

622
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,891
I was supposed to retire
when I was 30.

623
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,007
Retire?

624
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,161
Yeah, from all this stuff.

625
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,845
<i>And I did. Then they busted me
on that tax evasion bullshit.</i>

626
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,210
I predict the lovely couple here
will be leaving any minute now.

627
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,643
I don't think so, Frank.

628
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,122
When I got back that first
time, I couldn't stay retired.

629
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,690
<i>I remember, Hunter found all
my picks and threw them away.</i>

630
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,649
I just bought new ones.

631
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,684
Like I thought.

632
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,570
Impressive.
I missed the pattern.

633
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,244
That's right.

634
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,324
The human brain,
a lovely piece of hardware.

635
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,201
I'm very pleased
with your progress, Frank.

636
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,045
Planning this burglary
was a great idea.

637
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,281
Thanks.

638
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,725
We need to do this job
in a couple of days.

639
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,361
There's going to be a window of time when
they're gone. That's when we move in.

640
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,727
I can't promise I'll allow
the actual burglary,

641
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,848
but I'm glad to see
you so enthusiastic.

642
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,685
Oh, yeah. I haven't
felt this good in years.

643
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,408
Come on, let's arm wrestle.

644
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,165
Okay. Ready.

645
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,161
One, two, three.

646
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,524
What do I do, Frank?

647
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,362
You better see who that is.

648
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,361
Hi, there.

649
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,811
Maddy.
Daddy!

650
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,006
Hey!

651
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,525
Hey, honey.
Hi!

652
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,243
What a surprise.

653
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,164
And then I just thought, why not
just book a ticket to New York

654
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,447
and I can visit Mom, too,

655
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,446
and she thought it would be a good
idea for me to check up on you.

656
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,602
Would you like me to bring
in your bags, Madison?

657
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,841
No.

658
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,241
No, thank you.

659
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,561
Let the robot
get your damn bags, honey.

660
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,291
Daddy, that's why I'm here.

661
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,480
I thought about what you said
and I'm going to stay with you.

662
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,641
What did I say?

663
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,051
I'm saving you.

664
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,004
What did you just do?

665
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,921
I got the password from Hunter.

666
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,530
He's got a password?

667
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,806
He does.

668
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,404
Come on. I have a million
pictures I want to show you.

669
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,803
Oh. Turkmenistan.
I mean, amazing, amazing.

670
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,765
I fell in love with the people.

671
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,365
They've been through so much.

672
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,081
And there's such a need for the
kind of nanoloan finance non-profit

673
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,690
like the kind
I'm talking about.

674
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,525
But I really need to nail
the grant proposal.

675
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,001
And I thought, what better place to
write than this old place, you know?

676
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,128
That's why it's so perfect.

677
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,046
It's so beautiful, but so sad.

678
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,804
But so beautiful.

679
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,291
Hey, buddy.

680
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,366
Wake up.

681
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,251
What's your password?

682
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,448
One, two, three, four.

683
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,680
Come on, we got to get moving.

684
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,087
We're going to
miss our window. Huh?

685
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,844
Morning, Daddy.
Morning.

686
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,331
Are you hungry?
Yeah.

687
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,641
I went shopping.
I got you Cap'n Crunch.

688
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,326
The robot used to make me
a really great breakfast.

689
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,448
I went out and got all this.

690
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,890
Come on, honey. Why don't we
just wake the little guy up?

691
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,803
He can cook,
he can do the dishes.

692
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,928
No, no.
I am going to do it.

693
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,810
You can't just whisk away all your
responsibilities on your robot, Daddy.

694
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,727
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

695
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,881
I'm hungry.

696
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,327
Okay, let me
make you something.

697
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,290
Damn it, Daddy, stop!
Let me make you something.

698
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,249
Fine. I want lasagne.

699
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,924
Okay. Okay.

700
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,325
I can do lasagne.

701
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,685
This lasagne looks like crap.

702
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,761
Well, it's penne.

703
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,408
I'm going into town.
I'm going to eat at Harry's.

704
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,721
Daddy, Harry's is gone,
remember?

705
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,487
And I spent an hour
making this.

706
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,291
What are you talking about?
I ate there last week.

707
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,328
Would you just eat it, please?

708
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,208
How long are you
going to be here?

709
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,089
As long as you need me.

710
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,526
I'm fine.

711
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,522
Dad, what did you do
in the bathroom?

712
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,886
Seriously.

713
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,886
It's your cooking.

714
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,051
Very funny.

715
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,689
The robot and I used to go
in to town just for fun.

716
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,890
That's good for you and the robot. I'm tired.
It's too late for town.

717
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,122
Okay. I'm going
to go to sleep.

718
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,721
Fine.

719
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,962
If you go shopping tomorrow,
I'm out of Q-tips.

720
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,128
This place is a dump.

721
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,522
Madison.
Hey, Daddy.

722
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,364
I'm just finishing cleaning up.

723
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,601
Are you really?

724
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,809
Yeah, I just got so sick of the
mess that I pulled an all-nighter.

725
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,042
Who are you kidding, honey? You
turned the robot on, didn't you?

726
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,248
The robot?
I didn't turn the robot on.

727
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,402
I can clean a kitchen.
I'm an adult.

728
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,642
This place was a pig sty last night.
Look at it now.

729
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,165
Please turn him back on.

730
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,129
No, I'm not going
to turn the robot on.

731
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,601
You're not?
Fine, then, here.

732
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,842
Why don't you clean this up?

733
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,571
Daddy! You don't think
I can do anything?

734
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,768
The robot is not
your servant, Maddy!

735
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,842
You don't turn him on and
off like he's a slave!

736
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,402
Okay, I did it! Okay?
I used the robot!

737
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,004
I'm sorry! I just want to help you!
I don't know what to do!

738
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,687
Okay, all right. Calm down, it's okay.
I'm sorry.

739
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,240
I shouldn't have yelled.
It's just that...

740
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,210
It's not you. It's not you.
I need him.

741
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,645
No, you don't.
I do.

742
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,848
You don't understand.
I need him.

743
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,843
What do you need him for?

744
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,965
He's my friend.

745
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,361
Dad.

746
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,401
Hi, there.

747
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,563
So, we'll let it help us out
with a few little chores,

748
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,291
but we can't get
too reliant on it, okay?

749
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,841
Okay.

750
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,645
Thanks, honey.

751
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,966
We got to move soon. Tonight.

752
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,530
The window's almost closed.

753
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,250
I will listen to
your proposal, Frank,

754
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,970
and make my decision,
as we agreed.

755
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,330
I did this for years. Years.
And I developed my own system.

756
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,405
Always worked alone, so nobody
knows it but me. Until now.

757
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,802
Who, When, Where, and What.

758
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,241
First, the Who.

759
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,569
<i>The lovely couple
are Ava Lee and Jake Finn.</i>

760
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,961
<i>Married three years.
The money's on her side.</i>

761
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,328
<i>She's a lawyer. He's a
consultant, whatever that means.</i>

762
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,091
<i>They own this house
and an apartment in the city.</i>

763
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,162
<i>They spend just about
half their time here.</i>

764
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,370
<i>When they're out here, they always leave
for some kind of event or vacation.</i>

765
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,329
<i>That's our When.</i>

766
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,164
<i>That brings us to What.</i>

767
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,720
<i>As in, "What are we stealing?"</i>

768
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,283
<i>She has at least two pieces
that have to be in that house.</i>

769
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,362
<i>But how to go in?
That's our next "W."</i>

770
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,050
Where. I found the plans
on their architect's site.

771
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,441
<i>I have our entry path
sketched out.</i>

772
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,010
I have 10 possible exits,

773
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,650
<i>20 different scenarios,</i>

774
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,485
alarm trip, dogs,
houseguests, et cetera.

775
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,361
<i>It's all set.</i>

776
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,090
<i>But what about the How?</i>

777
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,845
A home like this will have
an advanced security system.

778
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,244
Aren't you just adorable? This is
where my years of experience come in.

779
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,610
<i>Every security system is designed
by security companies, not thieves.</i>

780
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,366
<i>It's not a question of if a thief
can break in, it's how long.</i>

781
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,371
<i>They place
all the heavy systems</i>

782
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,204
<i>where their customers
can see them.</i>

783
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,886
<i>They're selling
the feel of security.</i>

784
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,124
<i>It's never hard to find a spot that
they assumed no one could reach.</i>

785
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,603
<i>It just takes the right eye.</i>

786
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,604
<i>And have you found
that way in, Frank?</i>

787
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,444
<i>You bet I have.</i>

788
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,362
<i>There's no alarm here.
Just a flimsy little lock.</i>

789
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,289
<i>They're asking for it.</i>

790
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,490
<i>That brings us to the safe.</i>

791
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,643
I'll bet you a steak dinner,
we'll find it right here.

792
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,245
Do you know
the correct combination?

793
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,810
That's where you come in.

794
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,166
Me?

795
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,884
<i>You're going
to brute-force it.</i>

796
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,371
<i>Brute force?</i>

797
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,249
<i>That sounds like it might
attract attention.</i>

798
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,084
<i>All it means is,
you're going to try</i>

799
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,128
<i>every combination
until you get it right.</i>

800
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,771
That would take
a human like me weeks.

801
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,046
How long would it take you?

802
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,202
Assuming it's
a three-number combination,

803
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,408
somewhere between four seconds

804
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,882
and one hour and 43 minutes.

805
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,565
<i>It's perfection.</i>

806
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,768
<i>We know there's something
worth stealing.</i>

807
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,561
<i>We know when to go in, how to
get in, and how to get out.</i>

808
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,291
It would be a crime
not to do it.

809
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,605
So, how about it?

810
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,205
You have been thorough, Frank.

811
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,046
It is unlikely we'd be seen and
even less likely we'd be caught.

812
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,963
But although your
memory has improved,

813
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,371
you still have
a long way to go.

814
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,681
I'm fine.
I can handle this.

815
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,841
Are you in?

816
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,922
Only if you agree to eat a
low-sodium diet from now on.

817
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,163
Okay.
Okay.

818
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,405
What? What is it?
I'm trash to you?

819
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,283
You're acting like a baby.

820
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,250
Am I a bad baby?

821
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,245
Oh, shit.

822
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,886
Is something wrong?

823
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,089
What are these people doing
with this kind of stuff?

824
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,241
I don't understand.

825
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,883
Oh, this is way too hot.

826
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,961
Look at that.

827
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,647
We're just going to have
to sit on this, that's all.

828
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,246
We're just going
to have to sit on it.

829
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,804
It'll be fine. Yeah.

830
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,642
I made yours virgin, Frank.

831
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,961
Come on, buddy, I got troubles.

832
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,281
I need a little booze
to help unwind myself.

833
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,488
It's not good
for your blood pressure.

834
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,210
You worry too much.

835
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,684
What are you smiling at?
You two are funny.

836
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,046
Ahem. Cheers, Daddy.

837
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,281
Cheers.

838
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,722
Also, Frank, there's
someone here to see you.

839
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,600
What? Just tell them
I'm not taking visitors.

840
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,886
Hello?

841
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,364
Hey, there. Hello, Frank.
This is Sheriff Rowlings.

842
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,686
How do you do?
How do you do?

843
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,364
This is my daughter, Madison.

844
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,441
Hello.

845
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,488
And your name again, was what?

846
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,289
You remember me.

847
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,771
I don't buy your whole act.

848
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,649
Excuse me? Who are you?

849
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,645
What is this about?

850
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,406
Are you aware that your neighbour up the
lane here was recently burglarized?

851
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,811
No. What neighbour?

852
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,927
Jake and his wife.

853
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,367
Yeah, real professional job.

854
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,966
Frank, computer brought your name up.
Frank Weld, right?

855
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,121
Guilty as charged.

856
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,361
I think I read about
you at the academy.

857
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,930
Come on, that is ridiculous.

858
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,049
The police have been hassling
him for his entire life

859
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,168
about a few mistakes
he made when he was a kid.

860
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,083
Ma'am, you misunderstand me.

861
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,970
The computer thinks Frank's
a suspect, of course.

862
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,246
I don't mean any disrespect.

863
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,164
I can't see him pulling a job
like this off at his age. Sorry.

864
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,322
What?
What are you talking about?

865
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,731
He did it.
He obviously did it.

866
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,320
Jake, why don't you
go wait in the car?

867
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,920
I'm amazed that all these yuppies moving
in here just don't get hit more often.

868
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,607
I know, right? Listen, I
could really use your help.

869
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,762
As a consultant or something.

870
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,921
Be on the right side this time.

871
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,968
Are you kidding me?
Arrest him!

872
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,485
Okay. You know what?
Back off.

873
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,925
Calm down.
Jake, stop it.

874
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,047
What?

875
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,600
Everything's fine, okay? No one's
accusing anyone of anything.

876
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,091
We're all friends here.

877
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,800
What do you say, Frank?

878
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,130
My robot will be happy
to see you to the door.

879
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,450
All right, all right.
It's okay, I know the way.

880
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,000
I had to ask.
You guys have a good day.

881
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,008
I know you were
in my library, Frank.

882
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,491
I know you were in my house.

883
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,891
Jake, come on.
I know.

884
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,086
Jake.

885
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,006
I got a lot
of pull in this town.

886
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,805
Maybe I should stay
a few more days

887
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,689
and make sure
they don't bother you.

888
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,364
No. No, honey.

889
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,249
It's going to be fine.

890
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,447
Bye.

891
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,327
You knock them dead
in Turkmenistan.

892
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,611
Oh, you know what?
I got something for you.

893
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,524
A little surprise.
I hope you like them.

894
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,489
Are those from
the crazy man's house?

895
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,246
No. No.

896
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,728
These are from the old days.

897
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,363
I want to donate them
to your cause.

898
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,442
You keep them out of sight and then
you can pawn them someplace far away.

899
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,124
I know the drill.

900
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,926
Would you call Hunter, please?

901
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,680
I know he's a pain in the ass,

902
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,324
but he's just
worried about you.

903
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,084
I don't want to...
Call him.

904
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,684
You can tell him I said he
was right about the robot.

905
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,331
Bye, Robot.

906
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,131
Goodbye, Madison.

907
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,327
Are you sure you're
going to be all right?

908
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,528
Yeah. I think I am, actually.

909
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,047
We better get back
in the house.

910
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,531
Did you notice that van before?

911
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,841
I first noticed it
at 3:04 a.m.

912
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,446
That son of a bitch,
Jake, isn't kidding.

913
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,010
Maybe you should call Hunter.

914
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,242
You don't seem to be reacting
well to Madison leaving.

915
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,051
Wait. Did you let those two
bastards through this house?

916
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,167
Yes.

917
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,082
We got to get
rid of all the evidence now.

918
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,529
What about these, Frank?

919
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,726
Frank, there's another
piece of evidence.

920
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,486
My memory can be used against you.
You must reformat me.

921
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,803
Yeah, okay. Hold on.
Just hold on with that.

922
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,201
Let me alone.
Let me alone for now.

923
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,291
Frank, I'm concerned. I may have
to sedate you for your safety.

924
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,886
Back off, you little
astronaut bastard.

925
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,006
Back off.

926
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,165
Ow! Shit!

927
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,842
They're watching the house.

928
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,604
Any excuse to scan.

929
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,927
I think I should call Hunter.
You're behaving erratically.

930
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,684
What do you want
to call a hunter for?

931
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,569
Hunter, your son.

932
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,121
Oh.

933
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,051
Oh, yeah, Hunter.
No, he's sick of me.

934
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,328
Frank, you're not well.

935
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,967
No, I'm not. I'm dying.

936
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,005
What do you mean, you're dying?

937
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,447
Call Hunter.
Tell him I'm dying.

938
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,204
I don't think
you are dying, Frank.

939
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,045
No, it's just an exaggeration.
It'll get him up here.

940
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:23,090
I'm not going to be very
healthy in prison, am I?

941
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,442
<i>Hi, it's Madison. Why are you
leaving me a voice-mail?</i>

942
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,242
Madison, it's Hunter. Did Dad's
robot leave you a message?

943
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,882
Call me back when you get this.

944
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,406
Thank you.

945
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,887
Dad.

946
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,044
Hey.
Sorry.

947
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,244
How are you feeling?

948
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,728
I don't even feel like I have
the strength to stand up.

949
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,927
Listen, I was talking to the robot and I...
What are you doing?

950
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,240
I think we should
get you to a hospital.

951
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,890
No, no, no,
I want to stay here.

952
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,681
The robot's really more than
enough to look after me.

953
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,003
Okay. Well, I don't know.
I still think we should go.

954
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,448
I want to say something to you.

955
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,364
And I'm not good at this.

956
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,488
I was a lousy father.

957
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,041
Jesus, Dad.

958
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,124
I just want to tell you
that I knew.

959
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,051
All the time.

960
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,248
I knew I wasn't around a lot.

961
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,530
I hope you forgive me for that.

962
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,930
And I know it's a lot
to ask of you.

963
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,970
You come up here every week,
drive all the way up to see me.

964
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,361
I want to thank you
for that, too.

965
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,567
Do you remember what it was
like before, when I was little?

966
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,209
Yeah, sure. Sure.

967
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,245
I hope you do.

968
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,531
Remember when we had that little
apartment with that tiny backyard?

969
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,285
You know, I...

970
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,881
I think about that a lot.

971
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,444
Yeah, so do I. Look, I want you to
do something for me, would you?

972
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,367
I want you to put this
where nobody can find it.

973
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,963
What? Oh, God, Dad, what?
Why? What's in it?

974
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,168
No, don't ask me what's in it.

975
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,284
I don't want you
to take the heat for this.

976
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,203
And don't look inside it, okay?

977
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,521
You promise me that.
Just hide it someplace for me.

978
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,601
You want me to hide it?

979
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,284
Yeah, I want to...

980
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,407
I want to go out clean, Hunter.

981
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,881
I just want to
go out clean, please.

982
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,807
Okay.

983
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,244
Okay. Don't worry about it.

984
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,004
Do it now, please.

985
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,367
What? Yeah. It'll
make me feel better.

986
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,047
You want me
to hide it right now?

987
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,360
Yeah.

988
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,645
Just put it
someplace safe, okay?

989
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,040
You want me to hide this
right this minute?

990
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,650
Oh, Jesus.
Sorry.

991
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,245
No, it's okay.

992
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,924
You better go now.

993
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,284
Get out of the car, please, sir!
What?

994
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,204
Put your hands out of the car, please.
These guys are new.

995
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,281
Come on.

996
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,161
Step out of the car,
please. Slowly.

997
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,521
Thank you.

998
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,565
What's going on?

999
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,130
What's in the trunk?

1000
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,361
Yeah, what's in the trunk?

1001
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,521
Nothing. Golf clubs.

1002
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,011
Uh, a bag.

1003
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,050
Yeah, what's in the bag?
Dad!

1004
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,125
I don't know what's in that bag.
I found it.

1005
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,606
Beautiful.

1006
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,207
It's just beautiful.

1007
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,127
It's inside. They're inside.

1008
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,202
All right, Jake.
This is evidence.

1009
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,327
What the hell's going on?

1010
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,131
I want to search the house. Come
on, this is probable cause.

1011
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,247
Fine. Okay, fine.

1012
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,290
Okay, wait. Hold on. Wait a second.
Probable cause for what?

1013
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,489
Frank Weld is a suspect in a multi-million
dollar robbery up the road.

1014
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,961
What? That's impossible.
He's sick.

1015
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,806
He's sick.

1016
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,971
Good morning.

1017
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,368
Would you like to come in?

1018
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,850
Dad, why aren't you in bed?
What's going on?

1019
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,884
I'm just cooperating
with the cops.

1020
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,485
They always seem to
come and pester me

1021
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,289
whenever anything
remotely criminal happens.

1022
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,886
Yeah, but how are you feeling?

1023
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:04,770
I'm fine. I'm just not
getting enough sleep.

1024
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,130
I'm sorry, but thanks
for coming up to see me.

1025
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,126
Okay, wait, wait.

1026
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,248
Hey, any of you boys hungry?

1027
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,206
Wait a minute.
Where's his stupid robot?

1028
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,361
Who would like a selection
of fine cheeses?

1029
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,328
Nothing. You have got
to be kidding me.

1030
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,765
We have probable cause, okay?

1031
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,046
Not you.

1032
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,727
You're "dying"?

1033
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,001
You're playing games
about dying?

1034
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,889
I called Mom.
I called Madison.

1035
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,209
And what the hell are you?
You're lying for him?

1036
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,480
All right, everybody
get the hell out.

1037
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,450
We're not going anywhere until
we find what we're looking for.

1038
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,320
Hunter, don't worry.
There's nothing to find.

1039
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,165
Do you think I care? If there was anything
in that bag, I would turn you in myself.

1040
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,040
You're an egotistical prick,
you know that? I don't care.

1041
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,682
I just feel guilty because
at least I have feelings.

1042
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,603
The best thing you ever did
was being locked up

1043
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,120
so I didn't have
to be raised by you.

1044
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,042
Why do you think I left
you with a goddamn robot?

1045
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,925
Leave him out of it!

1046
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,968
Warning. Do not molest me.

1047
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,042
Dad, he's not your friend.

1048
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,122
He's a slave who, apparently,

1049
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,885
you can manipulate into
doing just about anything.

1050
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,891
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute, wait a minute.

1051
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,802
We should download
this thing's memory.

1052
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,887
Yeah.

1053
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,486
No, no.

1054
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,604
Just hold on there, now.

1055
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,604
You can't do that.
Frank, sit down.

1056
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,608
Warning. Do not molest me.

1057
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,761
You know what you're doing?

1058
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,604
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

1059
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,681
Hello, there.

1060
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,603
Self-destruct sequence
initialised.

1061
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,281
Ten.

1062
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,727
Nine.

1063
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,961
You didn't.

1064
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,166
Eight.

1065
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,561
I'd run.
Seven.

1066
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,324
Frank, stay there!
Don't move!

1067
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,447
Six.

1068
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,249
He's lying.
Five.

1069
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,402
There's no bomb.
Four.

1070
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,681
Three.

1071
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,807
Goddamn it!
Come on, come on.

1072
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,927
Two.

1073
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,881
One.

1074
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,124
What a hunk of crap.

1075
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,930
Son of a bitch.

1076
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,366
Get in.

1077
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,446
Frank!

1078
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,086
Nice work.

1079
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,480
Terrific.

1080
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,609
You shouldn't
be driving, Frank.

1081
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,728
Pull over and
reformat my memory.

1082
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,406
It's the only way for you
to remain safe and healthy.

1083
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,687
Can't you just
erase the bad parts?

1084
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,683
My memory
is a holographic array.

1085
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,526
If I lost half of it, I'd still have every
memory, just in half the resolution.

1086
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,641
Okay, but you can't just
lobotomize yourself.

1087
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,202
It's like I explained to you, Frank.
I'm not a real person.

1088
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,889
We'll lay low till we get a
chance to go back for the stuff,

1089
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,962
and then we're out of here.

1090
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,241
Are we going to
lay low here, Frank?

1091
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,086
I hope so.

1092
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,961
Here. Do your stuff.

1093
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,880
Hey, there.

1094
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,201
Oh, my God, Frank. Hunter called me.
Are you okay?

1095
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,441
Hunter called you?

1096
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,363
How did you get in here?
You're not allowed back here.

1097
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,521
I came to apologise.

1098
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,806
You don't need to apologise.

1099
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,963
You've just been very forgetful
these days, that's all.

1100
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,690
No, I'm not forgetful.

1101
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,445
I've just
been a little bit busy.

1102
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,126
I'm fine, really.
Please, can I come in?

1103
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,923
Okay. Come in.

1104
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,446
Thank you.

1105
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,764
I'm kind of
in a bit of trouble.

1106
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,444
Of course you are.

1107
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,400
No. Well, this is
worse than late fees.

1108
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,285
I guess I'm sort of on the lam.

1109
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,441
On the lam?

1110
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,567
Yeah.

1111
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,081
I've led a very colourful life.

1112
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,684
I'm a cat burglar.

1113
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,962
You took the <i>Don Quixote.</i>

1114
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,247
Didn't you? Oh, Frank.

1115
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,606
Well, I...

1116
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,608
I just wanted you to have it.

1117
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,525
Is that you?

1118
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,407
Yes.

1119
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,531
Is that me?

1120
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,445
When I moved back,
you just didn't remember.

1121
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,609
After our walk, we go
home, read for an hour.

1122
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,004
Then we have lunch.

1123
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,120
And...

1124
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,407
Then we stake out
our next target.

1125
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,481
Frank, wait.

1126
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,490
You really don't know any other information?
You haven't seen any...

1127
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,847
Oh... You gotta be kidding me.
Frank!

1128
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,926
Frank. Frank!
Hold it right there!

1129
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,047
Dad!

1130
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,490
No. Dad, stop!
Would you just stop?

1131
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,369
Frank, don't you lock this!

1132
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,723
Don't you touch
that robot, Frank!

1133
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,404
You are making this more
complicated than it has to be.

1134
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,290
By the time they get up here, we
can scale down from the window.

1135
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,091
Frank, stop.
Just wipe my memory.

1136
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,161
No.

1137
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:20,961
Frank, I know you don't like to
hear this, but I'm not a person.

1138
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,682
I'm just an advanced simulation.

1139
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,610
After you've wiped my memory,

1140
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,648
things can go back to normal,

1141
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,451
and you can continue
planning your next job.

1142
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,487
What did you say?

1143
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,006
Remember, Frank?
Your next job.

1144
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,888
You deal in
diamonds and jewels,

1145
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,962
the most value by the ounce.

1146
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,250
- Remember?
- Dad!

1147
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,845
It's not too late, Frank.
Just open up.

1148
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,285
Don't give up.

1149
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,204
Lifting that high-end
stuff, no one gets hurt.

1150
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,760
Except those insurance
company crooks.

1151
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,644
Show me what to do.

1152
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,245
You have to open the round panel
in back and push the small button.

1153
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,483
I've unlocked it for you.

1154
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,968
I knew you had an off switch.

1155
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,481
Dad.

1156
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,647
Dad?

1157
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,969
Hey, how are you doing?

1158
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,325
It's Hunter.

1159
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,601
Hunter.

1160
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,042
You want to go
for a walk with me?

1161
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,963
Yeah, that sounds good.

1162
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,607
So...

1163
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,125
How's Princeton?

1164
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,526
Princeton.

1165
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,160
Princeton's good.

1166
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,241
Good?

1167
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,288
Hey, it's Princeton.

1168
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,201
Yes.

1169
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,081
Well,

1170
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,049
that's one thing that I
don't have to worry about.

1171
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,561
My son did better
than his old man.

1172
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,171
Bye, Daddy.

1173
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,123
I'll come see you soon.

1174
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,846
Bye, Dad.

1175
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,761
What?

1176
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,882
<i>"Check the robot's
garden, under the tomatoes."</i>

1177
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,281
<i>"Have fun, kids. Dad."</i>
