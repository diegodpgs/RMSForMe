1
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,978
Good afternoon and welcome to the
Phase II Press Conference of the

2
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,345
upcoming mission for the
Global Precipitation Measurement.

3
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,486
To discuss the mission we have
with us John Stockton

4
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:08,150
GPM Project Formulation Manager
from NASA HQ.

5
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,423
Mohan Bhargava...

6
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,128
Project Manager and Spacecraft
Mission Director from GODDARD.

7
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,796
Over to you John.
- Thank you George.

8
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,071
The Office of Management and Budget
released the President's 2004

9
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,904
fiscal year budget plan in early February
flagging off the GPM Launch.

10
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:30,410
We have in the Formulation phase
of GPM taken steps to reduce risks

11
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,746
to ensure a mission
confirmation review.

12
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:38,318
That's where Mohan Bhargava,
our Project Manager comes in.

13
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,153
Thank you John.
Good afternoon everybody.

14
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:47,159
Before I come to Phase II, a quick update
on the recently concluded Phase I.

15
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:51,100
In Phase I we focused on the
Definition of Mission Scope,

16
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,406
Systematic Measurement Approach
and Technology Roadmaps.

17
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,503
Will you roll the tape please?
Thank you.

18
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,639
The core satellite is designed
like a TRMM Spacecraft.

19
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:08,318
It'll be launched in non-sun-sync
orbit at an inclination of 65-degrees

20
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,155
and an altitude of 400 kms.

21
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,788
The constellation satellites would be
pre-existing operational, experimental &

22
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,056
dedicated satellites,
with PMW radiometers.

23
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,527
They would operate both in
non-sun-synch and synch orbits

24
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,399
at an altitude of 600-900 kms.

25
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,813
You are welcome to
throw any questions.

26
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:45,151
What are the objectives of the Global
Precipitation Measurement programme?

27
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,695
Last question.
- Is this budget justified?

28
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,724
Globally, there is a danger of
water recession in the near future.

29
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:01,001
It will not be unreal to imagine that
in the 21st century, cities like

30
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:09,773
Beijing, Amman, New Delhi, Santiago,
Jakarta, Mexico City, Lima

31
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:15,414
and many others, will drink up, use up
their surrounding waters and perish.

32
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:22,821
Water is going to be rare. Is it not a
reason enough to justify any budget?

33
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,732
Are there any more questions?

34
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,431
Thank you for being here.
- Thank you very much.

35
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,383
I've never seen John Stockton
smile so much.

36
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,779
He is really very happy with us.

37
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,913
The press conference went off well.
And your presentation excellent!

38
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,258
This is a quantum leap for us.

39
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:01,292
Well, we can now let our hair down
now that Phase I is finally over.

40
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,638
Hey, you've been very quiet.
What's the matter?

41
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,813
I want to get a cup of coffee.
Would you like some?

42
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,445
Make me a strong one.
- Sure

43
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,058
Two new messages,

44
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,821
Hi Mohan. This is Paul tried
calling you at work and your cell

45
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,590
you seem to be in a meeting,
call me back.

46
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:45,039
Good afternoon Mr. Bhargava, this is
Steven Carter from the BCIS...

47
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:51,516
...your request for citizenship has been
accepted. Please call me on Monday. Bye.

48
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,753
Congratulations! Your request for
citizenship has been accepted.

49
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,661
You seem lost.
- Not really.

50
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,563
I get it. Work pressures are
stressing you out

51
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,241
and then you have no other interests...
No pubbing, no partying!

52
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,913
Take my advice,
you should get married!

53
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,979
You need a life partner.

54
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,791
Like they say - Happiness
only doubles when it is shared!

55
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,654
It changed My life!

56
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,359
No Vinod, that's not it.

57
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,865
Then what is it?

58
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,932
What's the matter?

59
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,602
Today is the death anniversary
of my parents.

60
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,173
Oh! I'm sorry.

61
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,208
No, It's okay.

62
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:06,015
I still vividly remember that I was in my
last year of University in Pennsylvania

63
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,290
...when I received the news
of their car accident!

64
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,660
Now I understand why
you've been so low all day.

65
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,032
You know Vinod...

66
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,774
There's something else,
which has been

67
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,676
pricking my conscience
these last few months.

68
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,984
Do you remember Kaveriamma?

69
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,055
Kaveriamma? Your old
maid servant, right?

70
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,154
Please don't call her a maidservant.
She was like a mother to me!

71
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:47,298
I'm sorry. I had no idea.
What about her?

72
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,095
As you know,
I was the only child.

73
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:59,804
My parents brought me up with a lot of
love, they provided me with everything.

74
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:06,414
But along with them, Kaveriamma too
had a special place in my life.

75
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,355
My mother would
make my breakfast,

76
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,023
while Kaveriamma would feed me.

77
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,026
My parents tucked me into bed,
while Kaveriamma sang me a lullaby.

78
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:26,869
From the age of two to seventeen
she looked after me completely.

79
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:34,508
You could say Kaveriamma was
like a second mother to me

80
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,186
So when was the last time
you met her?

81
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,557
At my parent's funeral.

82
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,859
I remember crying like a child
in Kaveriamma's arms.

83
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,965
It was a very tough time for me.

84
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,698
Then I came back here and
began to find a footing in life.

85
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,006
Kaveriamma would often write me letters,
and I would send her replies as well.

86
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:15,845
But later, I got so completely immersed in
my work, that I just lost touch.

87
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,453
All this is so out of the blue Mohan.

88
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,995
why did you suddenly
think of her today?

89
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,996
It's not sudden, Vinod.

90
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,561
I've been thinking about her
since the past few months.

91
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,702
I've been having recurring
nightmares of her being...

92
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,834
...old, feeble, and helpless.

93
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,073
Vinod, I have blundered.

94
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:52,414
I now feel very guilty
that I have neglected her...

95
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,428
...and haven't been able to
look after her.

96
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,759
I had become selfish Vinod.

97
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:06,701
She is the only thread who can
string the memories of my parents.

98
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:22,014
I was thinking of going to Delhi...
and bringing her here.

99
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,686
Absolutely! Brilliant idea!

100
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,592
But I don't think John will consent.

101
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,426
There can't be a better time for you
to ask for a vacation than now,

102
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:37,525
We are 28 weeks away from
the GPM launch. John won't refuse.

103
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,002
You think so?
- Yeah sure.

104
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,870
Promise to bring him back an
elephant or something.

105
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,375
Yeah sure!

106
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,422
Thank you very much.

107
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:12,135
So its on the outmost importance
to get the time pressure on the

108
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,396
stabilization unit.

109
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,073
Thank you very much gentlemen.

110
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,873
Excuse me John.
- Sure, tell me.

111
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,283
I have a request for two weeks off.
Need to go to India, is it possible?

112
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,215
Is everything ok back home?

113
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,112
Oh yeah everything is all right.
Just a pending matter.

114
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,551
When do you have to leave?

115
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,559
Actually as soon as possible.

116
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,689
28 weeks to launch?

117
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,564
You realize you have to delegate
some of this to others.

118
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,796
Oh yes yes I'll have a detailed
meeting with the team and

119
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,595
I'll be in constant touch
with Vinod from here.

120
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,040
Alright then, have a good trip.

121
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,471
Thank you very much John.

122
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,247
Amazing... John agreed very quickly.
I should have asked for a vacation myself.

123
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,113
Thank God you didn't. If you had,
he would have cancelled mine too.

124
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,901
May I clear your tray please?
Can I get you anything else?

125
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,269
No thank you.

126
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,373
This is your Captain here.
Good morning everyone.

127
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,068
We have now started our descent

128
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,643
And in a short time we'll be landing

129
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,110
at the Indira Gandhi
International Airport in Delhi.

130
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,218
Hope you had a comfortable flight
Thank you for flying Air India.

131
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,033
Your attention please.

132
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,140
Announcing the arrival of flight
Al-112 from New York

133
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,612
Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

134
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,644
How was the flight?
- Connecting flight was delayed. Rest ok!

135
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,086
Did you get anything for me?
- Yeah, everything's for you, kid!

136
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,352
So Kaveriamma... is she still living
in an Old age Home?

137
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,292
Did you speak with her?

138
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,354
No, I want to surprise her!

139
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,202
She'll be so glad to see you.
I'm sure she'll have forgotten me.

140
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,594
Obviously!

141
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:32,395
Excuse me.
- Yes? May I help you?

142
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,094
I've come to meet Kaveriamma.

143
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,230
Kaveriamma?
- Yes.

144
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,067
Kaveri oh yes! She doesn't
live with us any longer.

145
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,634
Doesn't live here?
- She stayed with us for about a year...

146
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,076
...till a woman came looking for her.
And then, Kaveri left with her.

147
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,209
But where did she go?

148
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,011
Just a minute,
I'll have to check the register.

149
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:09,026
<i>Bharatiji, this gentleman is
looking for Kaveri.</i>

150
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,469
Do you know where
is she now?

151
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,369
<i>Bharatiji used to share
the room with Kaveri.</i>

152
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,237
I remember her mentioning
a village before leaving.

153
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,577
Now what was it...?

154
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,709
Charanpur.
- That's right, Charanpur.

155
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,649
Where is this Charanpur?
- Never heard of it.

156
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,150
We'll find out.

157
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,352
Kaveri was a good woman.

158
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,155
We all miss her.

159
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,060
Here's the address.

160
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,402
Thank you!

161
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,870
Kaveri is very fortunate.

162
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,538
There was someone who came
for her then, and now once again.

163
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,516
Otherwise who cares
for old ones like us?

164
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,051
Come on.

165
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,094
Excuse me.

166
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,298
Here's the map.
You'll find Charanpur in here.

167
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,999
That'll be 150 rupees.
- That's ok. Don't pay me.

168
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,404
Do me a favor. Watch the counter
for me while I nip to the bank.

169
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,169
Get me a loan too!
- Sure, you'll manage the counter, right?

170
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,036
I'll just sit behind.

171
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,577
That's good.
- Come back soon.

172
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,884
Excuse me you've no respect?

173
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,821
What happened?

174
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,063
You can see I am picking up books,
and still you're walking all over them.

175
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,733
I did not mean to.

176
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,596
Look, books are a source
of knowledge and culture...

177
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,502
and if you don't know how to respect
them, you shouldn't be here.

178
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,811
Well I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

179
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,407
I'm sorry, I was just
looking at this map.

180
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,050
You want to buy these books?

181
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,219
No! I want to sell them!

182
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,951
Oh stupid question, I'm sorry.
- No I'm sorry.

183
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:53,154
Actually I'm just a little irritated.
- No, I saw what happened.

184
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,197
You dealt with the man right.

185
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,802
Some people just don't have
the basic etiquette.

186
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,940
Oh yeah... I'll do this for you.
Lots of books.

187
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,138
I will need a...
- Over there.

188
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,415
Yes, thank you.

189
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:17,587
That's 13 books of Mathematics into 17...

190
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:23,887
...is equal to 221/- + 22 Language
books into 12 is equal to...

191
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,290
Four-eighty five.

192
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,160
Four-eighty five!

193
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:39,033
That's 8 Geography books into
19 is 152, plus 485 is...

194
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,911
Six-thirty Seven!

195
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:47,680
Really 637? Thanks.

196
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:56,323
And these 8 note books at 113
and the total is...

197
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,323
Seven fifty.

198
00:19:58,964 --> 00:19:59,988
Must be right!

199
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:07,130
750 it is.
Your... maths is pretty good!

200
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,368
Actually, I should be
giving you a concession.

201
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,873
You selected the books,
you did the totalling...

202
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,649
you should be in my chair!

203
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,715
Then give me a concession?

204
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,281
Sorry I can't!

205
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,691
Actually my name is Mohan Bhargav.
I'm Rahul's friend...

206
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,360
...he's the owner of this shop,
he's just gone to the bank...

207
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,292
...he was broke you see...
needed to get some money

208
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,799
I'm just filling in for him.

209
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,470
Oh!

210
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,006
I'll just pack this for you
I just need...

211
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,142
Bags.

212
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,176
I have been looking
for Charanpur in this map

213
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,579
It's a small little village.

214
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,253
Have you heard of it?

215
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,559
Yes, I know where it is.

216
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:07,388
Go down National Highway No. 6 for
110 kms till you reach Charoti.

217
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,392
Take a left from there.

218
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,571
Then keep going for 80 kms till
you reach Azamgarh.

219
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,869
From there 20 kms on a dirt track,
you'll reach Charanpur.

220
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:24,742
Wow! Your geography seems
pretty good as well!

221
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,285
Here you...

222
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,924
Hello! Excuse me.

223
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,995
Please look after the counter...

224
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,443
What happened?
You sick of the job already?

225
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:58,879
No, a girl came in, bought a lot of
books... but left without her change.

226
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,377
Hey! Not bad!

227
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,347
You made a profit for the company on the
very first day! You've got the job!

228
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,456
She was amazing!

229
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,023
She even gave me directions
to Charanpur!

230
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,658
Great, where is it?

231
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,489
About 200 kms from here.

232
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,827
Spare me Mohan. Don't expect me to
leave the store and drive you there.

233
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:20,994
No worries!
I'll need a car though.

234
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,506
Take mine.
- No, no. Could I get a caravan?

235
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,338
Caravan? What for?

236
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,773
Don't know the conditions I'll have
to face in the village.

237
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,686
<i>Ok, ok Mr. NRI
(Non-Resident Indian)</i>

238
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,850
You'll have your caravan.
Don't worry.

239
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:45,052
<i>old Hindi film song</i>

240
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,935
Can you tell me which of these
paths will lead to Charanpur?

241
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,332
You have strayed from the path.

242
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:35,435
Really?
I've been following directions...

243
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,446
I must have taken a wrong
turn somewhere.

244
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,282
It was your destiny to make
this mistake.

245
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,812
Charanpur is pretty far from here.
I'm headed in that direction.

246
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,691
If you want,
I can show you the right path!

247
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:45,338
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

248
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,849
How beautiful is this world

249
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:54,018
Forget thy troubles all
Behold! The beds of flowers enthrall

250
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,525
Heed thee vibrant world's call

251
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,180
Wow!

252
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,714
Encore!

253
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,382
Sing.

254
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,216
This path now bids me:

255
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,558
Somewhere, someone's
waiting for thee!'

256
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,900
This path now bids me:

257
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:43,062
Somewhere, someone's
waiting for thee!'

258
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:54,578
Why doth my heart impatient be?
Who longeth to meet me?

259
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:58,745
Perhaps, in the narrowing compass
What I'd cherished is coming to pass

260
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:03,257
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

261
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,760
Life's a car; Time's the wheel

262
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,929
There's the river of tears for sure
And a garden of joys too, secure.

263
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,436
O brother, all these stare
intently upon thy path

264
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:20,604
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

265
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:24,111
How beautiful is this world

266
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:29,283
Forget thy troubles all
Behold! The beds of flowers enthrall

267
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:33,116
Heed thee vibrant world's call

268
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:55,143
Wherever I cast my eye
upon these paths

269
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,309
Colours stream in my glance

270
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,977
The breeze is cool, the shade cool too

271
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:08,156
Far, over there, I wonder whose
hamlet stands

272
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,829
Ah! How didst the rain clouds amass?

273
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,999
That my heart was brought
to such a pass

274
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,832
What dream have I seen?
- That every dream doth true appear,

275
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:27,501
Kindling fire in my body
If thy heart's path thou traverseth

276
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:31,671
Thou shallst pick pearl from
The oyster every moment

277
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:36,513
Only if thou couldst always
heed thy heart

278
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,851
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

279
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,187
How beautiful is this world

280
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:49,261
Forget thy troubles all
Behold! The beds of flowers enthrall

281
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:53,196
Heed thee vibrant world's call

282
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:23,727
The heart experienceth such ease

283
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:28,069
As though the burden upon the
shoulder hath dropped off

284
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:32,402
As though innocence of
childhood hath returned

285
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,911
As though at longest last in
River Ganga hast one had bath

286
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:50,085
As though at longest last in
River Ganga hast one had bath

287
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:54,425
The heart purged as it were
Every bond at large

288
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,591
I find the life sanctified now

289
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:02,603
There's love in my living,
a song upon the lips

290
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:06,937
This is verily the triumph of
thy life, O traveller!

291
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:11,275
Whichever direction thou goest,
Love alone thou squander

292
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:15,943
You light a million lamps,
O traveller!

293
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:20,284
Go on, O traveller!
O traveller! Go on!

294
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,950
Who is it that haileth me

295
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:29,126
The river, hill, lakes and streams,
the woods and trees

296
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,959
Who's it that signals from these

297
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:54,647
Go on, O traveller

298
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:02,632
How beautiful is this world

299
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,868
Excuse me.

300
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,845
<i>Do you know where Kaveriji lives?</i>

301
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,045
<i>Hey Chikku!
Take this man to Kaveriji</i>

302
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,564
Sorry!
- Watch it!

303
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,293
<i>Amma! Amma!
(Mother Mother)</i>

304
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,463
Amma!

305
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,458
Amma!

306
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,965
Wait a while.

307
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,803
She needs to be massaged like this
in the morning and evening, Maithili!

308
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,239
She'll cry a little, but ignore it.

309
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,708
Understood?
Now say.

310
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,778
Amma, someone has come
to meet you in a very big car.

311
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,443
A very big car?

312
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,450
Come on, now!
It's parked outside.

313
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,849
I am coming.

314
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,957
Chikku, hope this isn't
one of your pranks!

315
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,129
Look at that.

316
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,065
It's very big; isn't it?

317
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:25,803
What's going on?

318
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,307
Huh, who is this?

319
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,548
Go on take a guess!

320
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:36,277
I can't. Come on, who is this?
Let go of me!

321
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,649
<i>Atkan batkan dahi chatokan,
(Lord Krishna's childhood couplet)</i>

322
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,917
<i>If you're Yashoda, then who am I...?
(Lord Krishna's childhood couplet)</i>

323
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,557
Mohan!

324
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,558
Mohan!

325
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,560
Kaveriamma.

326
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,237
Mohan... it's you, it's really you!

327
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,905
I can't believe my eyes!

328
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,584
Do you know who this is?
This is Mohan, my Mohan!

329
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,587
The one I keep talking
to you about.

330
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,183
Come...

331
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,925
Stop! Wait right here.
Do not step inside. I'll be back.

332
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,612
Now you can come in!

333
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,450
Kaveriamma.
- Yes?

334
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,946
Oh... what are you doing?

335
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,129
I can't express how happy
I am to see you Mohan.

336
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:52,820
Let Gita come.
I'll tell her I've won the bet.

337
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,988
Bet? What bet?

338
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:02,826
Gita always said
"Your Mohan has forgotten you, Amma."

339
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:03,830
Really?

340
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,994
But I would always retort:
"No, he will come to meet me."

341
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,007
And then we had a bet!

342
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:15,167
If you did come, she would have to
treat me to an ice cream.

343
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,347
Ice cream? Kaveriamma!

344
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,012
Why?
- Because you haven't changed a bit!

345
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,185
You haven't lost your
appetite for ice-creams!

346
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,182
Why not?

347
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,845
Why not? Are ice creams meant only
for kids? Can't we oldies enjoy it?

348
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,023
Sit!

349
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,861
All right, you win. And by the way,
who says you're old?

350
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,366
So... who is this Gita?

351
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,775
Don't you remember?
You often played with her as a child.

352
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:48,500
She used to visit our Delhi house
with her mother.

353
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,013
Gita...

354
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:54,507
Are you referring to that
'Gitlee' by any chance?

355
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,249
Yes!
You called her that.

356
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,323
And this is Nandan
Gita's younger brother.

357
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:06,493
But we lovingly call him Chikku.
- Chikku! Hey Chikku!

358
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:12,262
He has faked a tummy ache today
so that he can miss school.

359
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,307
How old are you?
- Eight.

360
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:25,981
Which school do you go to?

361
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,981
I study in Navjeevan Paathshala.

362
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:32,145
My roll number is 6
and I am in the fourth standard!

363
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,482
The motto of our school is

364
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,717
Books are a source of knowledge
and knowledge is strength.

365
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,325
Your school seems to be a good one.

366
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,825
Why haven't you gone today?
- I had a stomach ache.

367
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:43,999
Really?

368
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,833
Was the pain here?
Or here?

369
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,007
Would you like to see my school?
- No, not now.

370
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,838
I want to talk to Amma.
- No! Let's go right now.

371
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,172
All right Chikku.

372
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,513
Mohan, why don't you
go visit the school with Chikku.

373
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,186
You can meet Gita as well.
She teaches there.

374
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,680
Ok, but I thought Chikku had a
stomach ache!

375
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,519
Ache? Oh yes!
It was there, but it just went away!

376
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,695
Let's go to my school now!

377
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,965
That's Uncle Postman!

378
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,773
Not just postman my dear

379
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,376
...I'm the plough and the bull, field
and seed, crop and the grains.

380
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,547
I am everything here!

381
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:34,217
I sort the letters, seal them
and distribute them as well!

382
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,053
When on my bicycle, I'm the Postman
and in my chair, Postmaster.

383
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,556
The name is Nivaaran Dayal Shrivastava.
How can I help you?

384
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,054
Can I call America from here?

385
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,889
There is no ISD here, but you can get
connected through Mizwa village.

386
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:55,232
By the way, there is no bank, no bond,
and no registry in this village.

387
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,575
I apologise, for the trouble
earlier today.

388
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,612
That's ok. You live abroad, right?
- Yes.

389
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,413
I too happen to know some English.

390
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,420
What can I do for you?

391
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:12,914
Very good.

392
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,427
<i>Look Mohanbhaiyya this is my school!</i>

393
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,323
I'm impressed, Chikku!

394
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,265
It was in 1942 that

395
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,443
the slogans of the 'Quit India Movement'
were first heard in Bombay.

396
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,605
From Bombay to Lahore (in Pakistan),
Lahore to Peshawari...

397
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,109
the Indian revolutionaries and the
British soldiers were locked in conflict!

398
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,621
Blows were dealt in succession,
bullets were whizzing and ricocheting.

399
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,625
But through all of it our protests were
on, and we never raised our hands!

400
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,028
I got hit by a bullet on
the shoulder as well.

401
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,463
Then they arrested us and
threw us in prison

402
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,297
<i>...we kept protesting- Inquilab zindabad!
(Long live the Revolution)</i>

403
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,633
<i>Dadaji, did you have a beard then?
- I wish I did!</i>

404
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,141
Then the bullet would have got stuck
in my beard and got lost!

405
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,579
I... am... going!

406
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,775
I... am... going!

407
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,813
We... both are... going!

408
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,650
We... both are... going!

409
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,989
We... all are... going!

410
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,321
We... all are... going!

411
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,290
Very good! Kamala, now you repeat...

412
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,161
I... am... going!

413
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,506
It's you!

414
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,666
I must have misunderstood your
directions and got lost.

415
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,673
Excuse me! This is a school
and a class is in progress.

416
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:45,712
I'm sorry.

417
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:50,012
Mohan bhaiyya this is Gita didi.
And didi didi, this is Mohan bhayya...

418
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,849
He has come from Aamkarica!
- Not Aamkarica, Chikku! America.

419
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,855
Chikku, what are you doing here?
I thought you had a stomach ache!

420
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,359
Amma asked me to show
Mohan bhaiyya the school so I just...

421
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,857
So you are Gita! Remember me?

422
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,364
I used to call you 'Gitlee'
when we were kids.

423
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,033
The children are
supposed to be studying.

424
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,936
I'm sorry.

425
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,376
Now I understand.
Mathematics, Geography...

426
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,050
Oh yeah, by the way...

427
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,213
...you forgot your 50 rupees
at the bookshop!

428
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,391
Thank you, will you please go now?

429
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,359
Yes. I'm very sorry.

430
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,530
I... am... going!

431
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,228
I... am... going!

432
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,464
Very good.

433
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,684
What's this?

434
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,754
This is a foot massager, that'll take
care of your aching feet.

435
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,752
There is no electricity at the moment.
- Why?

436
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,420
We have power failures quite often.
- Oh, when will it resume?

437
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,594
Nothing can be said for sure.
This happens 3-4 times a week.

438
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,627
Who are they?

439
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,102
<i>Gita's parents Shanta and Jagmohanji...</i>

440
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,938
who started the school in Charanpur.

441
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,383
<i>When Chikku was only five,
Jagmohanji passed away.</i>

442
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,618
Gita was studying in a college
in Delhi at that time.

443
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,284
As soon as she graduated,
she came here...

444
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,792
...to help her mother with the
running of the school.

445
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,299
But Shanta's health was on the decline,

446
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,698
till a point when she sent Gita to the
Old Age Home to fetch me.

447
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:51,968
Before dying, Shanta entrusted
the upkeep of Gita and Chikku to me.

448
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,162
Thanks.

449
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,493
Why did it take you so long, Gita?
- I had to correct a few test papers.

450
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,232
Thought I may as well finish it there.

451
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:25,001
Didi, didi, look what
Mohanbhaiyya got for me!

452
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,007
Guess what I'm going to
cook for you Mohan!

453
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,008
Very nice.

454
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,347
Your favorite tadka daal,
aloo ki sabzi and kheer.

455
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:33,950
Wow!

456
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,521
Gita! Now you will have to treat me
to an ice-cream.

457
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,182
You lost the bet.

458
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,530
Oh Kaveriamma, I've missed your food.

459
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,535
The kheer was especially good.

460
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,628
I knew you would like it.

461
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,374
Enough about me.

462
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,703
Now tell us about yourself... and America.

463
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,716
Everything's fine in America.

464
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,114
I have all the comforts.
I have all that I could ask for.

465
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,052
I'm glad to hear that.

466
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,083
<i>And how is your nasha going on?
(nasha - Hindi slang for drugs)</i>

467
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,622
Nasha?

468
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,058
Why? Have you quit it?

469
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,565
Nasha?

470
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:31,567
Nasa? NASA?

471
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,571
That's what I meant.

472
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,644
My work at nasha... I mean NASA
is going very well.

473
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,847
So, you're an astronaut?

474
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,049
No.

475
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:49,757
I'm a Project Manager for
Global Precipitation Measurement! GPM.

476
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,927
Global Precipitation Measurement.

477
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:56,864
Very good.

478
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,594
Look at this Mohan bhaiyya!

479
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:05,269
Wow! Very good. You are a great artist!

480
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,909
Chikku, you bunked school today.
And, you have to catch up with studies.

481
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,209
Good night Chikku!
- Say good night!

482
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,290
I owe you an apology.

483
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,789
Apology? For what?

484
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,527
I'm sorry...

485
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,136
...that I wasn't there to take care of you

486
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,403
What are you talking about?

487
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,062
Let me talk Kaveriamma!

488
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,837
I'm sorry... that I wasn't there to
take care of you.

489
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,138
I'm sorry... that I was not there
when you needed me most.

490
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,816
I'm sorry... that you had to go
to an Old Age Home.

491
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,053
Not another word now!

492
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,827
Son...

493
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,896
...these are all matters of destiny.

494
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,335
I have everything...

495
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,830
Everything, but you!

496
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,402
I miss you very much Kaveriamma.

497
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,501
Will you come with me?

498
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,067
Where?

499
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:15,669
America.

500
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:20,513
No, I'm fine here!

501
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,081
Just come with me, you'll love it there.

502
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,685
You'll get a lot of rest and peace.
It's a much better life there.

503
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,192
Let me think about this.

504
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,361
Come on now...

505
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,164
You should go to sleep here.

506
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,539
Here?

507
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,377
If you don't mind,
I will sleep in the caravan.

508
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,376
Now what new machine is this?

509
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,379
One that puts you to sleep!

510
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,186
Something like that!

511
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,219
Good Night.
- Good Night.

512
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,225
Good Night.
- Good Night.

513
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:46,892
Yes?

514
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:49,899
Yesss?

515
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,035
Sir, I am Mela Ram!

516
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,970
Hello. What do you want?

517
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,831
Sir, I have brought you breakfast.

518
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,576
Please try my breakfast.
- Breakfast? Not now.

519
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,746
Sir please, I made it especially for you.

520
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,241
I am a very good cook.

521
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,585
Got it... means understood!

522
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:24,093
You're a good cook! I'm impressed.
- Thank you sir.

523
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,535
You have come from America sir?

524
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,604
I have a question sir.

525
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,610
In America, are there a lot of highways?

526
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,946
Yes, there are. They are
called freeways there.

527
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,452
Got it!

528
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:43,950
Means I understood.

529
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,121
One more question, sir.

530
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,293
Be comfortable.

531
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,694
<i>Do they have Dhabas on these freeways?
(dhaba - an Indian fast food joint)</i>

532
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:54,964
Dhaba?
- Yes.

533
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,328
Sort of. Why?

534
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:00,629
What do you think?

535
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,967
Will an Indian dhaba
work on those freeways?

536
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,479
I think it'll work!
- Will it work?

537
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:16,347
I think maybe... thanks for the dhaba,
I mean breakfast!

538
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,485
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got to get ready!

539
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,816
Of course sir.

540
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:22,989
I'll meet you again sir.

541
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:24,892
Thank you, Thelaram.

542
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,561
Sir it's Mela Ram!
- Sorry, Mela Ram.

543
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,030
Sir last question.

544
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,994
Sir I will give you a very good offer sir.

545
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,172
We'll open a dhaba in partnership.

546
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,603
I will give you 50%
half share of all the money I make

547
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,402
I have even thought of a name
for this dhaba.

548
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,111
It will be called...

549
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:48,080
...Mela Ram Dhaba. Ok?
- Ok.

550
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,850
Happy?
- Very happy.

551
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,817
It's a deal sir.

552
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,890
<i>Jai Ramji ki!
(Lord Ram be praised)I</i>

553
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:56,852
<i>Jai Ramji ki!
(Lord Ram be praised)</i>

554
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,718
So this is your caravan!

555
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,383
Not mine. It belongs to a
friend of Rahul's.

556
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,622
It's nice! Isn't it Gita?

557
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,989
Chikku was right.

558
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,894
Really, this car is exactly like a house.

559
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,450
There's a kitchen here...

560
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,884
a TV...

561
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,858
a bathroom...

562
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,961
a bed too.

563
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:12,059
Wow! This car is like a house on wheels!

564
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,327
Er... yes. Absolutely!

565
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:15,665
It's very comfortable.

566
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,437
Now we should be going.

567
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,233
<i>We don't want to miss the Panchayat
(A village body for village governance)</i>

568
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:25,612
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Quickly.

569
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,244
District Council is deliberating
upon all the demands...

570
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,953
...made in the last
village panchayat meeting.

571
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,789
The decision will be taken soon.

572
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:38,283
<i>Sadanandji, please tell us when the
remaining electric wires are being put up?</i>

573
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,363
We plan to start
work as soon as possible.

574
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:45,467
<i>The Gram Panchayat has...
- Just a moment, Sadanand Bajpeiji.</i>

575
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:46,294
I've never seen a Panchayat before.

576
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,300
Whenever you are asked, all you say is
"We plan to start work".

577
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,632
You are the Block Development Officer

578
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:58,805
You are well aware that we have been
dealing with this problem for a long time

579
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,917
75% of the village is constantly plagued
with electricity failures

580
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:06,155
and the remaining one-fourth
still lives in darkness.

581
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:11,483
This is like covering your back
while your front's open.

582
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,662
Then, what's the use of
these electric wires?

583
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:17,823
<i>Dadaji, the Government Surveyor has
recorded his observations...</i>

584
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,661
it is now just a matter of a few days.

585
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,167
A few days?

586
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,839
In a few days I'll be at Heaven's Door.

587
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,008
Then you can come
light a bulb on my shrine.

588
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,946
Dadaji, don't say that,
may you live a long life!

589
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,015
Please don't mind Dadaji, even I have
a complaint against the village.

590
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:38,847
What?
- One hears that Dukhi, Santram and...

591
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,024
...their boys
steal electricity from the poles.

592
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:45,353
It's not us. It's Santram who's the culprit.

593
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,689
Hold your tongue! When did
we steal electricity?

594
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,692
Now I understand why there was
no power last evening.

595
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,372
Calm down everyone!

596
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:02,367
Sadanandji, this job
should be done soon.

597
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,877
Or else we'll take the matter to
the higher authorities.

598
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,375
Sangam, what is the next case?

599
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,284
Case No. 35, the school!

600
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:16,885
Yes Gitaji?

601
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,389
I wish to continue teaching children
in the existing premises.

602
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,395
The new alternate
place you are suggesting...

603
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,234
...is too small...

604
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:28,996
...and then it's also too far. Children
won't be able to walk so much everyday.

605
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,367
But why do you need such a big
space for the school?

606
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,343
You don't even have enough
children to fill up the classes

607
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,239
More children will come to
study in the school.

608
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,573
That's what you've been saying
for a year now!

609
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,179
She has been trying!
We've all been trying!

610
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,684
Look Dadaji, we need the school
space for the Panchayat.

611
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,753
Then the tehsildars also want to
establish their office in the school.

612
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,883
The village also needs a spare
room for the granary.

613
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:54,092
It will be the economic
center of the village.

614
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:59,094
And the place we are offering you
is good enough for teaching.

615
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:00,927
No, it won't be enough

616
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,272
I want to start a few more
classes in the school.

617
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:06,275
I want to reinstate those children

618
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,440
who've left the school
in the past couple of years.

619
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,106
And then there are some villagers who
are not sending their children to school.

620
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:16,114
Today, I appeal to all of them to
send their children to school.

621
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,117
All right, Gita.

622
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,624
If you can manage to enroll more
children in the next three months

623
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,126
then we're ready to reconsider.

624
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,966
But if there are no new admissions...

625
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,800
then you must agree to move
from the current premises.

626
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,968
This month's Panchayat is adjourned.

627
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,320
Come Mohan, let me introduce you
to the members of the Panch.

628
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,930
This is my Mohan.
He has just come from America.

629
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:04,666
Mohan... this is the head of
our village, Vishnuduttji.

630
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:05,766
Hello.

631
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,871
Namaste! (Greetings)
- My blessings, son!

632
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:11,939
Munishwarji.

633
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,675
God bless you my son.

634
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,506
Gungadinji.
- Namaste.

635
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:19,545
Fatimabi...
- May you live long my son.

636
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,341
...and Narayanji.

637
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,017
God bless you son.

638
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,617
May Lord Rama protect you.

639
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,014
What do you do in America?

640
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:30,354
I work in a company called NASA.

641
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,759
So, what does this
company manufacture?

642
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,691
We make satellites.

643
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,360
Now what is that?

644
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,033
Oh come on, Fatima...

645
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:45,302
...you know those things in the sky.

646
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:49,706
Satellites er... satellites...
- Let me explain.

647
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,943
Satellites are like
the moon orbiting earth,

648
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,377
which help us to know when,
where and how much it will rain

649
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:57,883
predict the changes in the atmosphere

650
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,555
they send us information
about all these things.

651
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,724
That's it!
- Isn't this what you had told me?

652
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:07,721
Wow Kaveri I'm impressed!
I had no idea you knew so much...

653
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,899
...about these things.

654
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,732
All this work that you have described
is done by our Sahdev out here

655
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,566
without rotating himself, believe me!

656
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,832
Hey Sahdev, tell us!

657
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:22,744
The sky is clear.

658
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:28,410
There will be no clouds in
evidence for the next two days.

659
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,251
Very good! That's precisely what I do too.

660
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,002
Mohan bhaiyya! Look!
That's the temple!

661
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:52,639
Beautiful!

662
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,703
Beautiful! What's this?

663
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,274
This is the specialty of our village.

664
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:04,784
These are the footprints of
Lord Rama and Sita.

665
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,288
What?!

666
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:11,115
Ram and Sita's footprints!

667
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,024
Charanpur! Ok.

668
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:23,237
<i>That explains the name of the village
Charanpur. (Charan means feet)</i>

669
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,564
How are you?
- I'm all right.

670
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,837
And Kaveriamma? How is she?
- She's fine.

671
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,911
I've been trying your cell phone.

672
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,180
There is no network coverage here.

673
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:13,921
Vinod I'm no longer in Delhi.
I'm in a village called Charanpur.

674
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,848
Oh. Anyway now what about
the GPM instrument concept

675
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,029
and risk reduction study
that needs to be initialized?

676
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,190
I'll e-mail you the graphics right away!

677
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:25,196
You do that. But the internet
connection here is weak.

678
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,062
I won't be able to
download the graphics.

679
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:30,600
Why don't you Fed-Ex the CD to
Rahul in Delhi? He'll send it to me.

680
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,041
Okay.

681
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,244
Come fast.

682
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:36,872
One more thing! The week will
pass by very quickly

683
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,538
All right.

684
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,807
I am going to be here a
little longer than I thought.

685
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,515
Kaveriamma has
some pending work here

686
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,220
because of which she can't
leave right away.

687
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:46,919
Ok. That's fine.

688
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,717
Can I have a word with John
regarding this? Is he there?

689
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:50,051
Don't worry about that
I will take care about that.

690
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,694
See you then.
- Bye.

691
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,290
Jai Ramji ki.
(Lord Ram be praised).

692
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:59,967
Well, well... the village lingo's getting
a hold on you. Jai Ramji ki! Bye. - Bye.

693
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,093
One moment.

694
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:06,408
How much was that?
518 rupees?

695
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:07,935
Five hundred eighteen rupees sir!

696
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:16,183
One moment sir.

697
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,387
Sir, you just mentioned
the word "internet".

698
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,116
I've heard the word "international".

699
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:25,985
but 'Internet'? What's that?
I think I've heard it before.

700
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:30,125
Internet... Internet is a medium
through which we can...

701
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,860
...connect and communicate
with people in any part of the world.

702
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:37,000
No Post-office needed!
This is called e-mail.

703
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:43,010
E-mail! Really?
Fantastic!

704
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,509
If this e-mail is somehow
installed in this village

705
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:49,683
I'll be in seventh heaven.
- How is that?

706
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:52,978
Because then I wouldn't have
to deliver any letters.

707
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,354
I would just sit here and
email them all.

708
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,955
Email is indeed the summum bonum

709
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:02,631
it would break the walls that...

710
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:06,700
...separate home and the world.

711
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,330
Thank you sir.
- Okay.

712
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,318
Time to get up!

713
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:35,927
Kaveriamma, don't wake me up!
Haven't slept like this in years.

714
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:39,061
Get up. We have
a lot of work to do now.

715
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:42,663
The guests will be here at eleven.
The house needs to be cleaned.

716
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,399
What's going on?
Who are the guests?

717
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:51,070
A potential groom is coming to
see Gita with his parents.

718
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:52,905
What?

719
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,343
They are from Azamgarh.
- Gita's marriage?

720
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,848
Yes!
- Yes?

721
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,013
Gita's marriage...!

722
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,516
I forgot to tell you last night.

723
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:05,550
About two months ago, Vishwasji,
the boy's father had written to me.

724
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,958
Now finally they'll be here today.

725
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:10,028
But what is the need for all this?
- What do you mean?

726
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:14,636
I mean... I mean what's the rush?
She's just a child!

727
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:21,206
What a strange thing to say!
Come on, get ready.

728
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,235
Why should I get ready?
As if they're coming to see me!

729
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:58,910
This is Gita.
- Namaste!

730
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,747
This is Raghunath.
- Namaste!

731
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:02,815
Please sit.

732
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,757
Excuse me; I'll just be back.

733
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:20,095
I've heard... you run a school here.
- Yes.

734
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,841
We have a business in chemicals.

735
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:34,275
Really.

736
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,443
The demand that you are making
is not acceptable to me.

737
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,807
Teaching is my profession
and my passion.

738
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:12,412
And I'd like to continue
this work even after marriage.

739
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,556
A woman's hands are full just
with the household chores.

740
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:20,655
I disagree! I'd like to take care of the
house as well as work.

741
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:24,162
Let me tell you, that we would not like the
women of our household to work outside

742
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:28,329
Besides I fail to see why you would
want to keep working after marriage?

743
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,097
What if I say the same to your son?

744
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,909
My parents too have brought me up
with equal love and affection...

745
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,104
they expect me to live my life with

746
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:42,241
self-esteem,
independence and self-reliance.

747
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:48,183
If your son has a desire to be something
in life, to make a mark in society

748
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,351
then why can't women
have the same desire?

749
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:54,261
Be it in any field women are
making their mark equally.

750
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,927
There's more to a woman than
just wearing bangles.

751
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,367
And after marriage, aren't the house
and the children as much...

752
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:04,706
...a responsibility of the man
as the woman?

753
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,369
Why can't the husband and wife
work as a team?

754
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,610
Why should one of them sacrifice
more than the other?

755
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,948
I don't accept the demand of not
being allowed to work after marriage.

756
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:23,816
You mean... are you rejecting
this proposal?

757
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,621
I have nothing else to say...

758
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:45,103
This is how the new generation thinks.

759
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:50,647
We should not carry this
matter any further!

760
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:55,083
I'm sorry Shardaji, Vishwasji.

761
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,422
It's all right.

762
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:48,575
I'm upset with what happened today.
- But I felt I was right.

763
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,644
I don't think you should have
expressed your views in this way.

764
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,042
Whatever it is, this is
against my principles.

765
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,644
Kaveriamma, Gita is right.

766
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,919
But Mohan, he was a nice boy.

767
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:02,646
You can change people's views
about life over a period of time.

768
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:07,261
Well, you do have a point there.
- No, I couldn't have changed him.

769
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:14,067
Habits can be altered over time but
narrow opinions and beliefs cannot be.

770
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,167
I'm absolutely sure

771
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,340
that their next demand would
be the dowry amount.

772
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:22,841
Quite possible. I completely
agree with you.

773
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:29,416
This thinking is imbedded in our culture
& tradition and it hampers the nation.

774
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,619
Excuse me.

775
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:35,186
Without culture and tradition the
country would be left with no soul.

776
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:39,092
But Mohan, we are not talking
about the country.

777
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:43,092
I know Kaveriamma,
but it's all connected, isn't it?

778
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:47,202
What is this soul you talk off Gita?
We are plagued with problems.

779
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,098
Will you disagree, when I say that
illiteracy is rampant?

780
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,306
That we have administrative problems!

781
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,540
We are yet under-developed.

782
01:06:56,245 --> 01:07:00,204
That's true! Illiteracy and
poverty are hand in glove!

783
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,882
Kaveriamma, your village has
not even got electricity yet.

784
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:09,047
Caste discrimination, overpopulation,
unemployment and corruption...

785
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:13,050
...our state of affairs is pathetic.
Pass me the salt.

786
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,732
You have drifted from our topic. But since
you've brought this up, let me tell you...

787
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:19,230
...the Government is trying to find
solutions for these problems.

788
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,903
Yes! Yes! We'll see how much good
their solutions will bring.

789
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,732
The infrastructure that the Government
has is not enough to cope with even...

790
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,464
...1/4th of the existing population,

791
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,471
The Government has always failed
in satisfying the peoples' needs.

792
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:32,747
The Government is making policies,
making efforts.

793
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:34,415
What do you mean by 'efforts'?

794
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:38,417
Just to make resolutions and
collect funds for them

795
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,054
is that where the
Government's work ends?

796
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:43,751
Whether this money even reaches
the grassroot level...

797
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,357
...whether the common man benefits
or not from their resolutions...

798
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,094
...are they not responsible
for that as well?

799
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:50,898
Yes they are.
- Then...

800
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,691
But what do you think the
Government is, after all?

801
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:56,165
The Government is a system, of
which the public is also a part.

802
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,972
You, me, this village... all of us!

803
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,106
Now if the system is lacking
in certain things, then...

804
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:05,838
...to rectify its weaknesses
is our responsibility as well.

805
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:10,107
God helps only those
who help themselves.

806
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:13,288
Yes Kaveriamma, but things
are not going to change here.

807
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,786
Because no one wants to change!

808
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:20,523
It's easy for you to criticize.
But are you doing anything about it? No!

809
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:21,254
Excuse me.

810
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,855
At least, I am not defending
the government like you.

811
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,800
I'm building satellites to help
technology advance.

812
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,301
For everyone mankind!

813
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,307
Some more curry?
- No!

814
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,144
But you are doing it all there.

815
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:38,472
I'm doing all that I can here,
at the village grass root level.

816
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,649
I'm trying to make this a better place!

817
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,341
Gita... you too are a typical Indian!

818
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,884
You Indians can't take criticism.

819
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:47,720
You Indians?

820
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:52,217
Sorry, I mean... we Indians...!

821
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,497
Anyway, we are aware that not much has
changed in our country in a long time.

822
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,164
But I still want to try
and make a difference.

823
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,167
You have given up all hope.

824
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:03,497
No I haven't..

825
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,064
Yes you have!
- No I haven't!

826
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,169
She's really a fighter, isn't she?

827
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:11,172
You're no less yourself!

828
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,679
Now what is to become of this girl?
He was such a nice boy.

829
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,677
There are other boys...
- I know

830
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:20,021
But it is not easy to please Gita.

831
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,688
She has too many expectations.

832
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:26,020
To top all this, there is the school case.

833
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:29,762
And until both these problems are solved
you won't be able to leave with me.

834
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,928
I have a plan...
let's split up the work.

835
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:34,866
I'm the boy... I mean...

836
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,402
...you find a boy and
I will find children for the school.

837
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,098
We'll round off all of
Gita's problems.

838
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,037
What did you say?

839
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,738
Nothing. Nothing at all!

840
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:50,942
Hail the Lord of Strength!

841
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,889
This is the first lesson in wrestling.

842
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:55,283
Remember it.

843
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,388
There's no letter for you Mohan babu.

844
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:03,288
You're a wrestler as well?

845
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:05,567
I have been wrestling
since I was a child

846
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:10,037
and it's my favourite hobby.
- Very good.

847
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:15,906
Just out of curiosity, till what
grade have you studied?

848
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:19,239
I mean, you must have worked
very hard to gain this post.

849
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,415
I am a graduate!

850
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,308
How fortunate you are!
- Fortunate... yes!

851
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:24,916
But I've also studied very
hard to attain this post.

852
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,415
I'm sure you studied hard

853
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:30,319
but at least you had the
opportunity to go to High School.

854
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,758
I feel very sorry for the
village children.

855
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,454
Why is that?
- I'll explain.

856
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:41,334
What are your views on the school case?

857
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:43,764
The school case? It's very simple.

858
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,806
The school must move from here.
That space is needed for the Panchayat.

859
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:49,667
That is why I feel bad for
the children of the village.

860
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:53,603
Look... the Panchayat is not allowing for
a High School to be started here

861
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:57,350
and what good is it going to be for
children to have studied till 4th Std?

862
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:02,280
If they want to succeed in life like you
then they must go to High School.

863
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,292
True...!

864
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:06,852
Look!

865
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:11,459
It's here the high school will stand.
The children will study here.

866
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:17,036
Then they can start writing letters
for their parents themselves.

867
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,634
Think about the work it will save you.

868
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:23,811
I think the school
should not shift from here.

869
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,648
I will talk to people in the village.

870
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,646
You must!
- Definitely

871
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:33,151
Praise the Lord of Might.
- Praise the Lord of Might.

872
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,380
Mohanbabu...

873
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:36,491
Yes?

874
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:42,588
Why don't you drop by our
wrestling ring sometime?

875
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:44,389
Sure, why not?

876
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,798
How about a wrestling session?

877
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:51,066
Sure!

878
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:59,271
Mohan babu,
I have a surprise for you...

879
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:02,180
Here... have some pakodas with
shimla mirch tandoori.

880
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,352
I've made it specially for you.

881
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:08,755
Is this all that you can make?
- No sir, I can cook whatever you desire.

882
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,522
Got it. Listen Mela Ram...

883
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:12,887
Please don't say a word.

884
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:15,355
I know what you have on your mind.
- What?

885
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:18,298
Actually I was thinking...
you must have felt bad.

886
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:20,368
I'll give you 60%.

887
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,363
I'll give you 60% in partnership.

888
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:24,697
Okay.

889
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,967
Your lunch and dinner
will be on the house!

890
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:29,835
I have changed the name of our dhaba.

891
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:34,580
We can call it Mohan's Mela Ram Dhaba

892
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,976
or Mela Ram's Mohan Dhaba.

893
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:38,883
You decide. Then we'll lock it.

894
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:41,716
The first one sounds ok.
Mohan's Mela Ram Dhaba.

895
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:45,321
Ok then sir... so deal done, sir?

896
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,388
But before that,
you'll have to help me.

897
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:51,065
Help? How?
- I wish to send the kids from...

898
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:53,791
...your community to the school
for which I need your help.

899
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:55,528
Understood.

900
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,903
But it's little difficult sir.

901
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,667
Well, then your going to America

902
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,773
also looks little 'difficult' to me.

903
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:04,810
It is easy sir.

904
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,241
I'm ready. Just tell me what I need to do.

905
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,818
Our children and their kids in
the same school? Never!

906
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:16,087
Lions and sheep never drink water
from the same pond, Mohanbabu.

907
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:23,423
So...

908
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,164
...what is your background?

909
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:29,668
I mean...

910
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:32,330
...what caste are you?

911
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:35,505
I'm a Brahmin!

912
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:39,507
Then learn to behave like one.

913
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:41,877
So what am I expected to do?

914
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:45,382
We've heard that you eat food,
cooked by Mela Ram.

915
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,388
Are you aware what his caste is?

916
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:53,052
But what difference does that make?
What age are you folks living in?

917
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,857
Don't you dare degrade our piety!

918
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:58,731
You've fallen, are you out to
drag us down too?

919
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:04,135
And you Nivaaranji, seems like
you've switched sides already!

920
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,305
I am only doing what I think is right.

921
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,535
If you have any objections
you don't have to accept this.

922
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:29,558
Hey Birsa. Mohanbabu wants to
have a word with you.

923
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,828
What has happened sir?
Have we done anything wrong?

924
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:37,096
No, not at all.
I just came to ask...

925
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,674
...if you would you like to send
your children to school?

926
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:46,245
Huzoor, the villagers that do not
allow us to work in the village...

927
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:49,381
...do you think they will agree
to educate our children?

928
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:54,917
Don't worry.
Your kids will go to school.

929
01:14:55,557 --> 01:15:00,017
Also, of what use is studying, now that
they are in their marriageable age?

930
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:03,725
My daughter Lajwa is going
to be engaged.

931
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:08,532
Child marriage!

932
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:14,034
Can you not see our situation?
We barely manage to fill our stomachs.

933
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:16,472
Who is going to pay their school fees?

934
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:20,180
Gitaji doesn't run the school for money.

935
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:24,647
Teaching is her passion... her life!

936
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,551
If we speak with her

937
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,781
we can assure you that
she will help you.

938
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:33,220
The village folks don't
want to see us around.

939
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:34,622
Just listen to me...

940
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,125
Let it be saheb.

941
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:41,561
Education is not in their destiny.

942
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:44,962
Not in my children's destiny.

943
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,577
What have you decided Vishnoji?

944
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,510
Studies are not going to
fill an empty stomach!

945
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:56,751
Since pottery will be
their livelihood

946
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,715
then why waste time studying?

947
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:01,513
Have you made these?
They are beautiful.

948
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,919
Tell me. How much do
you sell this pot for?

949
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,095
Thirty rupees.
- What!

950
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:09,259
We have a contractor in the city,
who buys it from us.

951
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:11,762
Sometimes we even get an extra
five-ten rupees.

952
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,492
We won't sell it for less than thirty!

953
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,097
The price of this pot in the city
is 100 rupees or more.

954
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:21,140
Maybe if you people were educated
you wouldn't be fooled like this.

955
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,871
I know that this art has been
passed down through generations.

956
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:28,545
I agree that your kids should
carry on this tradition.

957
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,611
But in this day and age, it is
crucial for them to be educated.

958
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,219
Is it not Nivaaranji?
- Absolutely.

959
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:37,550
Because education will help them take
this art to its deserving end...

960
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,560
...and earn appropriate prices.

961
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:45,126
You are selling us a dream!
Don't show us these dreams.

962
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,306
Namaste Sarpanchji.

963
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,810
Welcome Nivaaranji.
Welcome Mohanji.

964
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:04,646
Mohanbabu wanted to discuss...

965
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:06,480
I know, I know. Let me tell you...

966
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:10,382
Both my grandsons are
enrolled in the school.

967
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:13,726
We have great respect for
education in this house.

968
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:17,331
But I have heard that you have
two grand daughters as well

969
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:20,000
and both of them have dropped out?

970
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,329
Oh yes, Kusum and Suman...

971
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,230
They have both studied
till the fourth grade.

972
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,937
Now how much more can they study?

973
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,067
It's time for them
to learn household work

974
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,274
cooking and such things.

975
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,947
After all, this is what will help
them once they get married.

976
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:36,817
How can you say such things?

977
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:39,611
Education instills confidence in girls.

978
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:42,016
Don't you want to see
them study and live their lives

979
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:47,594
with self-respect... independence and...
self-reliance?

980
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:50,422
There's more to a woman
than just wearing bangles.

981
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,296
Agreed Mohanji!

982
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,704
But Charanpur does not even
have a High School

983
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:58,630
for these girls to study in.

984
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,633
But Mizwa village does.
You could have sent them there.

985
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:03,541
But now you don't need to
worry about that

986
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:07,215
because Gitaji is planning to open
a High School in Charanpur.

987
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,740
If she has your support that is.

988
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:16,852
Do support us.

989
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:28,666
No Mohanbabu!
Not possible.

990
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:31,735
But how long are you going to control the
children's lives on the basis of caste?

991
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:35,740
Who are you to tell us what
we should be doing?

992
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:39,409
How much do you know about the
ways and problems of this village?

993
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:41,909
I accept that you were
born in this country

994
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:45,086
but that doesn't mean you can
go around giving sermons.

995
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:50,247
We understand perfectly what we need
to do for the progress of our village.

996
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,923
But the only ones who stand to
lose are the children.

997
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,925
Enough of this! I don't want
to argue with you.

998
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,222
Father.

999
01:18:56,631 --> 01:19:00,499
For heaven's sake, stay out
of the village matters.

1000
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:04,431
Mohanbabu, you are just a visitor here

1001
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:07,437
roam around, enjoy the village...
why get into all this?

1002
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:11,277
Attention!
A movie is to be screened in Charanpur.

1003
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,972
Tonight the Panchayat has organized
a movie screening in the village.

1004
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:19,113
You must come and watch...
you'll enjoy!

1005
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:34,695
Get down.

1006
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,877
Ok sir, we'll meet later.

1007
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:49,114
Why? Won't you see the movie?

1008
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,751
I'll be sitting this side and
watching the movie

1009
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:52,820
Okay.

1010
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:09,234
By the way, which film
are they showing?

1011
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:11,972
Yaadon ki Baaraat! (Union of Memories)
- Who's union?

1012
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:16,235
Union of Memories!
- Oh, I heard... our union!

1013
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:18,510
Shut up

1014
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:22,238
Just kidding! It's one
of my favorite films.

1015
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,577
Please turn off your lanterns
the film is about to begin.

1016
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,521
Dear lords, kind patrons
and art-lovers!

1017
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,520
Here's an important announcement:

1018
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:36,264
Mothers must keep a vigilant eye upon
children during the screening.

1019
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:40,090
And please don't disturb your neighbour.

1020
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:45,365
So, presenting the separation
and union of three brothers.

1021
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:49,375
Todays' movie is...
Yaadon ki Baaraat.

1022
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:30,807
Sing us the song which you
always sing on your birthday

1023
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:04,936
What happened?

1024
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:08,577
What happened to the movie?

1025
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,317
Not a power failure again!

1026
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:12,545
Chikku, it's just temporary.

1027
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,244
No, it won't come back.
I know it won't.

1028
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:16,253
How much time will this take?

1029
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:19,052
It will take twenty minutes
to start the generator.

1030
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:23,692
Hurry up.

1031
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:32,064
Don't cry now children!

1032
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:33,774
Everyone quiet!

1033
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:35,006
Sit down.

1034
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,838
All the children on the
other side, quiet! Don't cry.

1035
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:39,271
Now, listen to me carefully.

1036
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:45,112
Everybody, now look up at the sky
and tell me what you see.

1037
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:51,124
The stars!

1038
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:58,592
Now tell me... can you see the stars
forming a plough?

1039
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:03,130
Plough?

1040
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:07,668
Yes, plough.
Do you see it?

1041
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:13,640
No.
- I'll help you.

1042
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:16,580
Look...

1043
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:20,113
...can you see that brightest star
in the sky?

1044
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,956
Can you see it?
-Yes.

1045
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:26,927
Along that star on the right
are three stars in a line.

1046
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:28,491
Yes.

1047
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:32,828
Can you see them?
- Yes.

1048
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:39,337
Now below the third star,
five stars form a curve to the left.

1049
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:49,014
Can you see them?
- Yes.

1050
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:52,582
Now look at them as one.

1051
01:24:57,358 --> 01:25:00,850
Look closely. You will see
the plough taking shape.

1052
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:21,779
I can see it!

1053
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,415
Yes, plough.

1054
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:29,554
So what we must understand is...

1055
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:33,887
...if we want, these stars

1056
01:25:33,995 --> 01:25:36,463
...we can make anything out of them.

1057
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:42,459
But if we look at each star,
Though it looks beautiful,

1058
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:47,366
...it is only a
shimmering lone star.

1059
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:26,275
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1060
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:29,744
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1061
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:33,348
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1062
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:36,785
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1063
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:40,290
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1064
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:43,862
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1065
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:47,465
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1066
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:51,196
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1067
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,169
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1068
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:55,706
a handful, a hundred stars
Shimmering luminaries

1069
01:26:55,910 --> 01:27:00,074
every star's a fiery spark!

1070
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,413
Thou hast seen the rainbow

1071
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:39,017
Pray, how many art the hues?

1072
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,519
Seven colours so to speak

1073
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:46,057
Yet how many shades its company keep?

1074
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:49,627
Know this to begin,
if the colours wert alone

1075
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:53,163
How couldst a rainbow be full blown?

1076
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:56,859
If we wert not to join hands,
to fight cause unjust

1077
01:27:57,071 --> 01:27:59,767
There wouldst be no public, nor trust

1078
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:03,375
Know thus and protest not,
that the weak hath lost

1079
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:07,344
Hmmm... the star, star

1080
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:10,711
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1081
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:14,282
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1082
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:17,816
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1083
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:21,228
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1084
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:24,897
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1085
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:28,728
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1086
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:30,597
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1087
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:33,296
a handful, a hundred stars
Shimmering luminaries

1088
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:36,636
every star's a fiery spark!

1089
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:20,120
Of drops well-gathered

1090
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:23,688
Doth a river swell

1091
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:27,088
Ocean too is of drops assembled

1092
01:29:27,328 --> 01:29:30,695
But for the drops, it is but a naught

1093
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:34,299
Grasp this riddle;
for if drop wert all alone

1094
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:37,733
It would be quite nothing.

1095
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:41,375
Wert we to leave others;
desert one and all,

1096
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:44,545
Lonely our lot is, to appall.

1097
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:48,341
Why not unite then in a single current?

1098
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:51,882
Hmmm... the star, star

1099
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:55,317
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1100
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:58,887
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1101
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,454
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1102
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:05,858
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1103
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,503
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1104
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:13,333
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1105
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,133
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1106
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:17,868
a handful, a hundred stars
Shimmering luminaries

1107
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,173
every star's a fiery spark!

1108
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:57,551
Peasant who wieldeth a plough,
of earth reapeth gold

1109
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:04,749
Cowherd tending cows,
of milk a river flows

1110
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:15,234
Blacksmith that mouldeth iron,
every tool fashioneth

1111
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:22,270
Mud that a potter holdeth,
turneth into pitcher

1112
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:25,844
All these art the fonts of labour
And of desire to work a wish

1113
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,538
None inimical with any
All art united in common dream

1114
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:36,084
Harken! Everyone's but a kin
None an outsider to pin

1115
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:39,758
This simple truth, regard thou,
my friend!

1116
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:43,522
Hmmm... the star, star

1117
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:46,791
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1118
01:31:47,568 --> 01:31:50,366
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1119
01:31:50,972 --> 01:31:53,941
Fancy, the one who would
love from afar

1120
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:57,603
This star, the one yonder
and every little star

1121
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:01,111
Shouldst these but
together shimmer

1122
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:04,944
Entire firmament is filled
with glimmer

1123
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:06,779
Twinkling stars,
a couple o' stars

1124
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:09,649
a handful, a hundred stars
Shimmering luminaries

1125
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:13,452
every star's a fiery spark!

1126
01:32:52,059 --> 01:32:52,923
Gita!

1127
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:58,255
I want to talk to you
about something important.

1128
01:32:59,233 --> 01:33:01,258
I cannot keep it in me anymore.

1129
01:33:02,403 --> 01:33:03,768
Go on.

1130
01:33:05,406 --> 01:33:07,931
I had recognized you at the
bookshop in Delhi.

1131
01:33:09,009 --> 01:33:11,773
And I'd guessed that you had
come to take Kaveriamma away.

1132
01:33:12,646 --> 01:33:15,479
You did not make a mistake
in the address of Charanpur.

1133
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:18,544
I had deliberately given you
the wrong directions.

1134
01:33:21,088 --> 01:33:22,988
Why is that?

1135
01:33:24,758 --> 01:33:26,055
Call me childish...

1136
01:33:27,595 --> 01:33:30,223
...but I did not want you
to reach Charanpur

1137
01:33:31,098 --> 01:33:32,565
and to meet Kaveriamma.

1138
01:33:34,101 --> 01:33:38,231
For all that you're doing for the
school, I'd like to thank you!

1139
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:42,238
But I cannot let you take
Kaveriamma away.

1140
01:33:42,443 --> 01:33:43,307
Why?

1141
01:33:43,777 --> 01:33:45,301
You want her so that

1142
01:33:46,113 --> 01:33:49,082
she can take care of your house
and do all the household chores.

1143
01:33:49,283 --> 01:33:50,250
How dare you say that?

1144
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:52,578
How can you accuse me
of such a motive?

1145
01:33:52,953 --> 01:33:54,750
I have travelled 12,000 miles
only out of concern for...

1146
01:33:55,289 --> 01:33:56,756
...Kaveriamma's well being.

1147
01:33:56,957 --> 01:33:58,584
If you were so concerned

1148
01:33:58,959 --> 01:34:01,427
then where were you when she
was in an Old Age Home?

1149
01:34:01,629 --> 01:34:03,893
It was I who traced her
and got her here.

1150
01:34:04,298 --> 01:34:06,926
Maybe, that's because

1151
01:34:07,201 --> 01:34:10,295
you needed someone to take
care of Chikku and your house.

1152
01:34:14,974 --> 01:34:16,601
Why did you come back?

1153
01:34:18,144 --> 01:34:19,941
Why did you have to come back?

1154
01:34:22,148 --> 01:34:24,116
We were so happy.

1155
01:34:25,652 --> 01:34:27,813
You have everything in life.

1156
01:34:30,156 --> 01:34:34,115
But all we have is Kaveriamma.

1157
01:34:35,995 --> 01:34:38,327
You are not the only one
with a right over her.

1158
01:34:41,501 --> 01:34:45,961
I agree that she is
like a mother figure to you...

1159
01:34:46,673 --> 01:34:48,300
...and you like a son to her.

1160
01:34:50,677 --> 01:34:52,304
But she is a mother to me too.

1161
01:34:55,682 --> 01:34:59,982
I don't want to
become an orphan again!

1162
01:35:03,856 --> 01:35:05,346
I understand Gita.

1163
01:35:08,861 --> 01:35:11,489
I will not allow you to take
Kaveriamma away from me.

1164
01:35:16,035 --> 01:35:18,435
Kaveriamma will come
with me to America.

1165
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:25,269
Whether you like it... or not!

1166
01:35:48,234 --> 01:35:50,600
I'm in a dilemma Fatima.

1167
01:35:50,903 --> 01:35:55,033
Mohan is asking me to go with him,
while Gita expects me to be here.

1168
01:35:55,241 --> 01:35:56,367
I just don't know what to do.

1169
01:35:56,576 --> 01:36:00,706
Allah knows, when Mohan arrived
I was so happy for you.

1170
01:36:00,913 --> 01:36:04,007
But I never thought things
would get into such a tangle.

1171
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:07,651
You'll have to disappoint
one or the other.

1172
01:36:07,754 --> 01:36:13,420
I'm not clear whether I should go to
America with Mohan or not!

1173
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:19,062
I don't understand why he
wants to take you there?

1174
01:36:19,265 --> 01:36:23,634
To work there? Did you ask him?

1175
01:36:24,437 --> 01:36:30,569
No Fatima. He respects me.
He'll take good care of me.

1176
01:36:30,843 --> 01:36:33,778
Well, I hope you are right Kaveri.

1177
01:36:34,113 --> 01:36:37,810
Otherwise who is to know what
tomorrow has in store?

1178
01:36:40,953 --> 01:36:45,481
Kaveri, why don't you ask
Mohan to stay on over here?

1179
01:36:45,892 --> 01:36:49,157
No, he won't agree.

1180
01:36:49,461 --> 01:36:51,656
Remember one thing...

1181
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:55,932
...every piece of ice is inevitably
ordained to melt in its own water!

1182
01:36:56,134 --> 01:36:59,001
Get him to understand
this perfectly well.

1183
01:37:18,323 --> 01:37:19,585
We played a lot.

1184
01:37:22,094 --> 01:37:23,561
Kaveriamma...

1185
01:37:23,829 --> 01:37:26,696
...you can stop looking
for a groom for me!

1186
01:37:26,998 --> 01:37:29,967
I have decided... not to get
married at this point!

1187
01:37:30,168 --> 01:37:31,829
But why?

1188
01:37:32,504 --> 01:37:38,704
Yes. I want to focus all my time on the
children and the school's progress.

1189
01:37:39,511 --> 01:37:42,241
That's alright, but...

1190
01:37:42,514 --> 01:37:45,677
Furthermore, I'm not yet prepared
for marriage!

1191
01:37:52,858 --> 01:37:55,292
Well done!

1192
01:37:56,695 --> 01:37:59,755
This is a good move
to stall Kaveriamma from leaving.

1193
01:38:01,533 --> 01:38:05,264
But then, come to think of it
who will want to marry you anyway?

1194
01:38:05,470 --> 01:38:08,439
Now, don't get me wrong!
I'm not saying you're not beautiful.

1195
01:38:08,707 --> 01:38:14,009
But this attitude, tonnes of
ideals and principles...

1196
01:38:14,212 --> 01:38:16,077
...who'll suffer all this?

1197
01:38:16,715 --> 01:38:19,650
It's a good thing, you have
decided to opt out yourself.

1198
01:38:20,385 --> 01:38:25,789
But there is one crazy guy,
who might want to marry you.

1199
01:38:39,171 --> 01:38:41,537
Yes Mohan, the precipitation
measurement list has been drawn up.

1200
01:38:41,807 --> 01:38:44,674
You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes Vinod.

1201
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:49,210
We've tested the dual frequency radar,
the horizontal & vertical resolution's fine

1202
01:38:49,414 --> 01:38:56,047
Yes, but the waveforms need to match
with the longitudinal parabolas.

1203
01:38:56,254 --> 01:38:58,051
Of course, of course
they work in alignment.

1204
01:38:58,423 --> 01:38:59,685
Nivaaranji... Nivaaranji...

1205
01:39:00,091 --> 01:39:02,218
Here speak to Steve.
- Hi Mohan.

1206
01:39:02,427 --> 01:39:06,557
Steve, what about the
geometrical axis function?

1207
01:39:07,098 --> 01:39:11,831
It's being calibrated. The baseline
parameter's been optimized.

1208
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:17,640
See, the sun-synch orbit needs to be in
alignment with the radiometers of TRMM.

1209
01:39:18,276 --> 01:39:20,574
Ok, I'll make the remaining readings
and call you in a couple of days.

1210
01:39:20,879 --> 01:39:22,141
Ok, thanks.

1211
01:39:22,614 --> 01:39:26,141
Hey Mohan so how's everything else?

1212
01:39:26,451 --> 01:39:28,476
Everything's fine. All is well.

1213
01:39:28,786 --> 01:39:30,754
So, have you found yourself
a village belle?

1214
01:39:31,121 --> 01:39:32,247
Actually, you can say yes.

1215
01:39:32,356 --> 01:39:33,721
What?

1216
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:36,483
You're kidding me right?
- No.

1217
01:39:37,628 --> 01:39:39,619
What's her name?

1218
01:39:39,964 --> 01:39:43,365
Her name is Gita.
Kaveriamma lives with her.

1219
01:39:43,634 --> 01:39:45,295
I don't believe this!

1220
01:39:45,636 --> 01:39:47,297
Except, she's no village belle...

1221
01:39:47,638 --> 01:39:50,300
She studied in Delhi
and now she runs a school here.

1222
01:39:50,474 --> 01:39:52,772
Have you told her?

1223
01:39:53,143 --> 01:39:54,440
Does she know?

1224
01:39:54,812 --> 01:39:56,780
How can I tell her?
- What do you mean?

1225
01:39:56,981 --> 01:39:58,380
I mean...

1226
01:39:59,149 --> 01:40:04,451
I mean she's got a different set
of ideals et al. She's just different.

1227
01:40:04,822 --> 01:40:07,222
Come on!
You can't make that mistake.

1228
01:40:07,491 --> 01:40:08,958
You have to tell her how you feel.

1229
01:40:09,326 --> 01:40:10,953
All right... if you say so.

1230
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:13,288
Listen I'll catch up with you later,
gotta go now.

1231
01:40:13,497 --> 01:40:17,160
Your two weeks are almost up!

1232
01:40:17,835 --> 01:40:18,893
I know.

1233
01:40:19,169 --> 01:40:20,295
I'll be back soon.

1234
01:40:20,504 --> 01:40:24,099
You should have been back already.
- But let me propose to her first.

1235
01:40:24,508 --> 01:40:26,908
I'll be leaving soon,
catch up with you later, bye.

1236
01:40:27,044 --> 01:40:28,033
Bye.

1237
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:32,171
Gurnaamji, how much was that?

1238
01:40:35,185 --> 01:40:38,018
32 minutes. Is it ok if I pay tomorrow?
- Yes.

1239
01:40:38,355 --> 01:40:42,155
My apologies Mohanbabu!
The electricity is problematic here.

1240
01:41:13,557 --> 01:41:15,855
Why are you trying to
corrupt Chikku's mind?

1241
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:17,687
What are you talking about?

1242
01:41:17,895 --> 01:41:21,353
Haven't you been talking to him and
his friends about going to America?

1243
01:41:21,565 --> 01:41:23,032
No Gita, I was just explaining...

1244
01:41:23,233 --> 01:41:27,533
Am I teaching these kids so that they can
go abroad and settle down like you?

1245
01:41:27,738 --> 01:41:30,798
You NRI. Non-Returning Indian!

1246
01:41:34,578 --> 01:41:36,102
Hand me the mug, please.

1247
01:41:37,581 --> 01:41:40,550
You don't even know how to have a bath.
You should learn from Chikku.

1248
01:41:40,751 --> 01:41:42,218
Gita, I think you need a vacation.

1249
01:41:42,586 --> 01:41:44,850
Why don't you come back
with me for one?

1250
01:41:47,091 --> 01:41:48,888
Gita, you are very mischievous.
Where's the bucket?

1251
01:41:49,093 --> 01:41:50,560
Listen...
- No. You listen to me.

1252
01:41:50,761 --> 01:41:54,561
What?
- I like you very much... Gitli!

1253
01:41:54,932 --> 01:41:56,900
What?!
- It's true, Gitli!

1254
01:41:57,267 --> 01:42:01,863
I liked the way you handled
that man in the bookshop.

1255
01:42:02,206 --> 01:42:06,575
Don't try to sweet talk me.
Kaveriamma will stay here... with me!

1256
01:42:06,776 --> 01:42:09,404
You're misunderstanding.
I really like you.

1257
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:12,907
Shut up! And don't you try
to corrupt the kids again, ok?

1258
01:42:13,116 --> 01:42:16,381
I'm not corrupting anyone.
I'm only bathing.

1259
01:42:20,056 --> 01:42:23,219
More than the kids, you're the
one who needs an education!

1260
01:42:28,131 --> 01:42:30,531
You can keep calling out to
YOUR Kaveriamma now.

1261
01:42:44,981 --> 01:42:49,475
All right now, remove your notebooks.
The topic is General Knowledge.

1262
01:42:49,819 --> 01:42:51,047
So who's going to tell me...

1263
01:42:51,254 --> 01:42:55,554
...the names of five of the most
important rivers in the country?

1264
01:42:57,427 --> 01:42:59,622
I'm sorry to be late teacher.

1265
01:43:10,106 --> 01:43:11,903
Look ahead.

1266
01:43:16,512 --> 01:43:18,707
Today I'm going to take your class!

1267
01:43:21,184 --> 01:43:22,549
First question...

1268
01:43:22,852 --> 01:43:26,151
...name five main rivers in India?

1269
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:28,987
You...

1270
01:43:30,693 --> 01:43:31,785
...tell me!

1271
01:43:33,863 --> 01:43:35,160
Let me think.

1272
01:43:37,467 --> 01:43:41,426
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...

1273
01:43:44,207 --> 01:43:45,834
...Bharati...

1274
01:43:47,376 --> 01:43:48,502
...Panchgani...

1275
01:43:48,711 --> 01:43:52,977
Bharati? Panchgani?
Are they rivers?

1276
01:43:54,383 --> 01:43:56,044
Vidya, you tell me.

1277
01:43:56,385 --> 01:44:01,186
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...
Godavari and Brahmaputra.

1278
01:44:05,495 --> 01:44:06,985
Excellent Vidya!

1279
01:44:08,731 --> 01:44:10,062
Second question...

1280
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:15,803
...name the new state that has
been formed in North-West India?

1281
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:21,142
I know this one.
It was a part of Uttar Pradesh, right?

1282
01:44:25,581 --> 01:44:27,139
Yes Chikku. You tell us!

1283
01:44:27,416 --> 01:44:28,883
It's Uttaranchal!
- Oh yes, Uttaranchal!

1284
01:44:29,085 --> 01:44:31,019
How could I have missed it?
I forgot!

1285
01:44:31,921 --> 01:44:33,513
Well done, Chikku!

1286
01:44:34,757 --> 01:44:36,418
Now the last question...

1287
01:44:36,759 --> 01:44:40,286
...if our new student does
not know the answer...

1288
01:44:40,763 --> 01:44:43,664
...we'll have to demote him to
a lower class.

1289
01:44:59,281 --> 01:45:02,341
How many lion heads does
the Ashoka pillar have?

1290
01:45:06,454 --> 01:45:07,887
This one is easy.

1291
01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:09,120
Three.

1292
01:45:09,457 --> 01:45:12,392
Noooooo! It's got four!

1293
01:45:14,963 --> 01:45:17,932
Excellent, children!
The lesson of the day is...

1294
01:45:18,133 --> 01:45:20,101
...before gaining knowledge
about foreign lands,

1295
01:45:20,402 --> 01:45:23,963
it is important that one should
know one's own country first.

1296
01:45:29,477 --> 01:45:31,672
Don't forget to do your homework.

1297
01:45:39,254 --> 01:45:42,690
The rivers Ganga and Jamuna have
their confluence point in Allahabad.

1298
01:45:42,991 --> 01:45:44,754
The new state Uttaranchal...

1299
01:45:44,993 --> 01:45:48,292
...is the 27th state of India
with Dehradun as its capital.

1300
01:45:48,496 --> 01:45:51,294
This is the land where the
Mahabharata was written!

1301
01:45:51,666 --> 01:45:53,861
The Ashoka pillar rests
in a circular abacus,

1302
01:45:54,169 --> 01:45:57,297
which is girded by four animals.
The bull of the West...

1303
01:45:57,606 --> 01:46:05,377
...the elephant of the East,
the horse of the South...

1304
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,580
...and lion by the North.

1305
01:46:11,686 --> 01:46:17,818
Gita, the blackboard is clean.

1306
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,997
Gita... I am...

1307
01:46:31,206 --> 01:46:32,434
Gita...!

1308
01:46:36,711 --> 01:46:38,542
But all my answers were correct.

1309
01:46:39,047 --> 01:46:42,847
This is Natthu, the potter and
this is Shankar...

1310
01:46:43,051 --> 01:46:44,177
...he makes baskets.

1311
01:46:44,386 --> 01:46:48,322
Both of them want us to admit
their children in school.

1312
01:46:48,556 --> 01:46:51,184
What Mohanbabu said to us
the other day touched our hearts.

1313
01:46:51,559 --> 01:46:55,552
We don't want our
children to suffer like us.

1314
01:46:56,064 --> 01:46:58,191
<i>On the morning of Dussehra
(Indian festival)</i>

1315
01:46:58,566 --> 01:47:01,194
you can come and enroll your
children in the school.

1316
01:47:01,403 --> 01:47:03,098
Yes ok.

1317
01:47:07,075 --> 01:47:09,202
The tides have begun to
change direction.

1318
01:47:09,577 --> 01:47:10,976
Haven't they?

1319
01:47:20,588 --> 01:47:22,146
I'm sorry.

1320
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:35,068
Mohan!- Yes?

1321
01:47:36,437 --> 01:47:40,396
Mohan, I have some work for you.
- What work?

1322
01:47:40,607 --> 01:47:42,734
There's a place called Kodi a
few miles from here.

1323
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:45,237
Gita has some family property there,

1324
01:47:45,612 --> 01:47:48,080
which has been leased to a
farmer called Haridas.

1325
01:47:48,449 --> 01:47:50,940
He has not paid his rent for
some months.

1326
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:52,881
I want you to go an
recover the money.

1327
01:47:53,454 --> 01:47:54,580
Me?

1328
01:47:55,456 --> 01:47:57,754
But why do you want me to go?
Can't you send someone else?

1329
01:47:58,058 --> 01:48:01,152
If you go and ask
he just might pay up.

1330
01:48:01,462 --> 01:48:04,329
Oh! So you want me
to be a collector now!

1331
01:48:04,631 --> 01:48:08,795
Ok, when should I leave?
I have to fuel up the caravan.

1332
01:48:09,136 --> 01:48:11,104
You have to leave now.
- Now?

1333
01:48:11,305 --> 01:48:14,763
Yes, and you can't take the caravan there.
- Then?

1334
01:48:15,142 --> 01:48:17,269
You will have to take the train
for three hours to Narsinga...

1335
01:48:17,478 --> 01:48:19,537
...then a boat journey across
the river to Maangaon...

1336
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:23,111
...and finally three hours by bus...
and you've reached Kodi!

1337
01:48:23,317 --> 01:48:27,879
Sure, that's pretty closeby!
- You'll return by tomorrow evening.

1338
01:48:28,155 --> 01:48:32,387
And Mela Ram will go with you.
He knows the way.

1339
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:36,026
Kaveriamma...
- Yes?

1340
01:48:37,765 --> 01:48:42,202
My vacation is nearing it's end.
What have you decided?

1341
01:48:43,771 --> 01:48:46,137
You finish this work first.

1342
01:48:51,845 --> 01:48:53,710
Come on Collector saheb...!

1343
01:48:57,684 --> 01:48:59,083
Why are you sending Mohan?

1344
01:48:59,286 --> 01:49:01,982
I sent Haridas a message only
a few days ago.

1345
01:49:03,023 --> 01:49:05,719
I know what I'm doing!

1346
01:49:14,435 --> 01:49:16,995
Good morning sir.
- Good morning Melaram.

1347
01:49:17,204 --> 01:49:20,605
I'm all set to take you on a
sightseeing trip of the village.

1348
01:49:27,214 --> 01:49:28,374
Ok, I'll take your leave.

1349
01:49:28,549 --> 01:49:31,382
Mohanbhaiyya, you'll
bring me a toy, won't you?

1350
01:49:31,552 --> 01:49:34,953
Of course! Gimme five... yes!

1351
01:49:45,065 --> 01:49:47,795
And what shall I bring for you?

1352
01:49:48,235 --> 01:49:49,668
Nothing.

1353
01:49:51,572 --> 01:49:56,532
I know you don't want me to leave,
but I have to go for Kaveriamma.

1354
01:49:57,244 --> 01:50:00,236
And listen, don't think
about me too much.

1355
01:50:00,913 --> 01:50:02,676
Don't miss me too much.

1356
01:50:03,249 --> 01:50:06,685
Now what makes you think
that I'll miss you?

1357
01:50:07,253 --> 01:50:08,686
The look in your eyes!

1358
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:12,455
They give your feelings away.

1359
01:50:54,133 --> 01:50:56,761
O beloved, most beloved, surely

1360
01:50:56,969 --> 01:51:00,029
I am infatuated with thee

1361
01:51:00,306 --> 01:51:03,434
Thou hast endeared my heart

1362
01:51:03,643 --> 01:51:07,101
O beloved...

1363
01:51:09,982 --> 01:51:12,780
O beloved, most beloved, surely

1364
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:16,053
I am infatuated with thee

1365
01:51:16,322 --> 01:51:19,450
Thou hast endeared my heart

1366
01:51:19,659 --> 01:51:22,526
O beloved...

1367
01:51:22,762 --> 01:51:25,788
My heart's bewildered

1368
01:51:25,998 --> 01:51:28,967
My body with fire kindled

1369
01:51:29,168 --> 01:51:32,137
It's monsoon of my dreams

1370
01:51:32,338 --> 01:51:35,307
The courtyard of my eyes streams

1371
01:51:35,675 --> 01:51:38,644
The pitcher of my heart is overflowing

1372
01:51:38,844 --> 01:51:45,807
O beloved...

1373
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:26,590
O dear who hast drawn so near!
O dear who hast endeared my heart!

1374
01:52:26,892 --> 01:52:29,690
How canst I recount

1375
01:52:30,062 --> 01:52:34,158
What hath been thy bequest pray how?

1376
01:52:35,067 --> 01:52:38,036
Somewhere art buds of
a throbbing heart

1377
01:52:38,236 --> 01:52:41,205
Somewhere the dream-lanes

1378
01:52:41,406 --> 01:52:44,375
Mirth that dwells in the heart,

1379
01:52:44,576 --> 01:52:47,204
How shallst I articulate?

1380
01:52:47,412 --> 01:52:50,381
Thou swayeth me so

1381
01:52:50,582 --> 01:52:55,417
That oft times I am embarrassed

1382
01:52:55,620 --> 01:53:01,957
It seems I have lost
my path

1383
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:08,156
Ever since I have seen the
haven of love

1384
01:53:08,366 --> 01:53:11,199
Haven of love

1385
01:53:11,603 --> 01:53:14,697
O beloved, most beloved,
surely

1386
01:53:14,906 --> 01:53:17,807
I am infatuated with thee

1387
01:53:18,043 --> 01:53:21,103
Thou hast endeared my heart

1388
01:53:21,313 --> 01:53:24,510
O beloved...

1389
01:54:00,485 --> 01:54:06,856
Now that thou hast met me
This world's transformed

1390
01:54:07,058 --> 01:54:13,054
Methinks the flowers have begun
to beset my path

1391
01:54:13,264 --> 01:54:18,759
And I fancy too
That this earth's renewed

1392
01:54:18,970 --> 01:54:26,138
The sky too freshly spun
in our love

1393
01:54:26,478 --> 01:54:29,413
Wanton breeze singeth some melody

1394
01:54:29,614 --> 01:54:34,551
River too narrates some tale

1395
01:54:34,753 --> 01:54:41,090
All's changed, my love
since my eyes courted thine

1396
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:47,390
I have lost presence of my mind,
gone is my treasured selfhood

1397
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:51,558
O beloved...

1398
01:55:09,654 --> 01:55:11,622
Haridasji!

1399
01:55:15,994 --> 01:55:17,018
Haridasji!

1400
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:18,685
Yes?

1401
01:55:23,967 --> 01:55:26,663
I'm Mela Ram and this is
Mohan Bhargavaji.

1402
01:55:27,004 --> 01:55:28,028
Tell me.

1403
01:55:28,172 --> 01:55:32,541
Kaveriji and Gitaji have sent me.
It's about the land's rent.

1404
01:55:34,845 --> 01:55:36,039
I understand.

1405
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:38,648
Come in.

1406
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:50,088
You have travelled a long way.
You must be tired. Please rest.

1407
01:55:51,028 --> 01:55:52,962
Make some bread.

1408
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:55,658
Run along now.

1409
01:55:56,867 --> 01:55:57,959
Please come in.

1410
01:56:15,052 --> 01:56:17,418
You really shouldn't have bothered.

1411
01:56:18,889 --> 01:56:22,586
How is that possible?
A guest is like God!

1412
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:26,825
We've served what we have;
you eat and then we'll talk.

1413
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:28,386
Ok.

1414
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:46,948
If I had the capacity to pay,
I would have come to Charanpur myself.

1415
01:56:47,584 --> 01:56:51,418
Sir, I was a weaver before I
took up farming.

1416
01:56:52,589 --> 01:56:55,057
Since the advent of machine
woven fabrics in the market,

1417
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:57,693
weaving had ceased to
be a lucrative business.

1418
01:56:58,996 --> 01:57:03,592
So I became a farmer.
I took Gitaji's land on lease.

1419
01:57:05,102 --> 01:57:11,041
I'd imagined, once the crops flourished
the children's life would improve.

1420
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:14,634
But it was not to be!

1421
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:17,470
Why?

1422
01:57:18,782 --> 01:57:22,582
By taking up farming,
I had changed my profession.

1423
01:57:23,954 --> 01:57:28,823
The village elders did not accept this
and looked upon me as an outcast.

1424
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:35,857
They felt a weaver should remain a weaver,
even if it meant, that he had to go hungry.

1425
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:43,068
I cried, pleaded...
but no one listened to me!

1426
01:57:44,808 --> 01:57:48,869
Nobody offered a drop of
water to irrigate my land.

1427
01:57:51,148 --> 01:57:52,672
Entire crop dried up...

1428
01:57:53,984 --> 01:57:57,750
...and whatever survived,
the villagers refused to buy.

1429
01:57:59,488 --> 01:58:02,514
It is because of this, I've not
been able to pay Gitaji's rent.

1430
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:05,752
But this is wrong.

1431
01:58:08,831 --> 01:58:12,858
It's unfair. It is an outrage!

1432
01:58:13,336 --> 01:58:15,429
It is the way things work here.

1433
01:58:17,506 --> 01:58:19,371
Not a morsel to
fill our stomach,

1434
01:58:20,509 --> 01:58:24,707
no clothes to wear,
no roof above our heads,

1435
01:58:25,681 --> 01:58:28,445
no education for children,
nor land!

1436
01:58:29,685 --> 01:58:35,248
The thirst in my heart alone
knows the taste of my tears!

1437
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:39,054
Then what did you do?

1438
01:58:39,528 --> 01:58:40,654
What could I do?

1439
01:58:41,864 --> 01:58:45,595
I thought about migrating to the city,
hoping life would be better there.

1440
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:50,396
Those who had been there,
recounted the anguish in the cities.

1441
01:58:51,874 --> 01:58:57,335
A labourer goes there to work,
and falls into the grip of contractors.

1442
01:58:59,048 --> 01:59:04,577
He either returns hungry,
or never returns.

1443
01:59:05,888 --> 01:59:09,654
And soon, the wife has to
sell the little land she has.

1444
01:59:10,559 --> 01:59:12,083
No sir, no!

1445
01:59:12,895 --> 01:59:16,763
I couldn't feed my
children in this life...

1446
01:59:18,734 --> 01:59:20,429
...what is to happen after me?

1447
01:59:21,570 --> 01:59:24,630
And about Gitaji's money,

1448
01:59:25,908 --> 01:59:30,709
I have nothing to offer
except helplessness and shame.

1449
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:33,439
Nothing...

1450
01:59:49,932 --> 01:59:53,732
Thank you for the food, Haridasji.

1451
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:32,004
Haridasji, I'll take your leave.

1452
02:00:37,645 --> 02:00:41,513
Please don't mind. Here's
some money. Keep it.

1453
02:00:41,983 --> 02:00:46,113
Mohanbabu, it's very kind of you
but I can't accept it.

1454
02:00:46,488 --> 02:00:48,285
Please Haridasji, I want you to keep it.

1455
02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:51,186
When you have it, you can
return it to me.

1456
02:00:51,493 --> 02:00:55,259
But I don't know when I will
be able repay it.

1457
02:00:57,665 --> 02:00:58,689
Don't worry about it.

1458
02:01:01,002 --> 02:01:05,063
Here Chotu, this is for you.
Share it with your sisters.

1459
02:01:08,009 --> 02:01:12,708
Please give Gitaji
and Kaveriji my respects.

1460
02:02:43,438 --> 02:02:54,246
Water for sale... water for sale...
25 paise for a glass...

1461
02:03:03,458 --> 02:03:07,827
25 paise for a glass of water...

1462
02:03:08,796 --> 02:03:10,320
Saheb, please have a glass of water.

1463
02:05:02,242 --> 02:05:03,709
Mohan you're back!

1464
02:05:11,752 --> 02:05:13,310
How was your journey?

1465
02:05:14,588 --> 02:05:16,852
Ok.
- Did you meet Haridas?

1466
02:05:17,758 --> 02:05:20,625
Yes. But I could not get the money.

1467
02:05:25,098 --> 02:05:29,626
His situation is pathetic.
He can't pay the rent!

1468
02:05:29,936 --> 02:05:33,394
Instead, sir gave him money
from his own pocket, before leaving.

1469
02:05:35,442 --> 02:05:37,637
I couldn't bear to see
Haridas' condition.

1470
02:05:40,947 --> 02:05:43,279
I don't think you should expect
any rent from him.

1471
02:05:45,952 --> 02:05:48,045
Mohanbhaiyya, did you get me my toy?

1472
02:05:51,791 --> 02:05:53,349
I couldn't get anything.

1473
02:05:57,296 --> 02:05:58,490
Come Chikku.

1474
02:06:06,472 --> 02:06:09,441
Mohan this is the general
state of affairs.

1475
02:06:10,976 --> 02:06:14,571
What is money when compared
with the value of human life?

1476
02:06:15,981 --> 02:06:18,506
I'm glad you gave him money.

1477
02:06:19,652 --> 02:06:24,351
Now don't get disheartened.
Rest a little.

1478
02:06:38,904 --> 02:06:40,030
Kaveriamma...

1479
02:06:41,674 --> 02:06:43,505
...how do I wrap this around?

1480
02:06:49,014 --> 02:06:51,539
Kaveriamma has left for school.
For the decorations.

1481
02:06:52,017 --> 02:06:54,918
I don't know why she wants
me to wear this dhoti?

1482
02:06:55,187 --> 02:06:56,882
What's wrong with my jeans anyway?

1483
02:06:57,022 --> 02:06:59,991
It is the appropriate thing to
wear on Dussehra.

1484
02:07:00,192 --> 02:07:01,523
If you wish I can tie it for you.

1485
02:07:01,694 --> 02:07:04,162
How do you know?
Have you ever worn one?

1486
02:07:04,363 --> 02:07:05,830
It's not a saree, ok!

1487
02:07:06,198 --> 02:07:08,063
Ok then! Do it yourself.

1488
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:12,227
All right, all right.
Just do it quick.

1489
02:07:12,705 --> 02:07:13,729
Come...

1490
02:07:18,377 --> 02:07:19,401
Give...

1491
02:07:21,547 --> 02:07:22,571
Hold it.

1492
02:07:40,733 --> 02:07:42,132
What the...

1493
02:08:20,606 --> 02:08:22,039
There, it's done.

1494
02:08:25,611 --> 02:08:27,101
Sure, it's done...

1495
02:08:27,612 --> 02:08:31,013
...but I hope it doesn't
unravel in a crowd! Or else...

1496
02:08:31,216 --> 02:08:32,240
Shut up!

1497
02:08:35,119 --> 02:08:38,577
Today is the auspicious day of Dussehra.
It was on this day that Lord Rama...

1498
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:43,921
had slain Ravana and marked the
triumph of good over evil!

1499
02:08:44,128 --> 02:08:50,397
I am very happy that on this day
we initiate new students in the school.

1500
02:09:02,146 --> 02:09:03,613
May the Goddess of Knowledge
be with you.

1501
02:09:03,815 --> 02:09:05,077
It's Lajwa.

1502
02:09:13,324 --> 02:09:16,020
This is our little granddaughter Kusum!

1503
02:09:20,832 --> 02:09:22,697
Now, go and play.

1504
02:09:27,505 --> 02:09:33,102
Mohanji, where are you off?
Why don't you spend some time with us?

1505
02:09:34,846 --> 02:09:37,974
I'm impressed. How well you've
tied your dhoti Mohanbabu?

1506
02:09:38,182 --> 02:09:39,979
How did you manage to learn so quickly?

1507
02:09:40,184 --> 02:09:42,652
It's pretty easy. It was tied in seconds.

1508
02:09:42,854 --> 02:09:44,549
You're looking like a bridegroom.

1509
02:09:47,258 --> 02:09:48,054
Thank you.

1510
02:09:48,192 --> 02:09:52,288
So how long have you lived abroad?

1511
02:09:52,530 --> 02:09:54,828
It's been almost twelve years now.

1512
02:09:55,033 --> 02:09:57,900
You must have adapted yourself
completely to their way of living?

1513
02:09:59,203 --> 02:10:04,664
We would also like to know a
thing or two about America.

1514
02:10:05,209 --> 02:10:10,044
Well... America is a big country...

1515
02:10:10,214 --> 02:10:14,173
We've heard that it's also very rich?

1516
02:10:14,552 --> 02:10:17,817
Rich it is. But there are several
reasons for that.

1517
02:10:18,056 --> 02:10:22,493
One among them is that their land
is rich in mineral resources...

1518
02:10:22,727 --> 02:10:26,060
Even our land is rich, but in crops.

1519
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:28,824
Our strength... lies in our fields.

1520
02:10:29,233 --> 02:10:31,201
Do they have problems of rain?

1521
02:10:31,402 --> 02:10:34,860
Are they affected by drought
and famine like us?

1522
02:10:35,073 --> 02:10:36,870
And what about electricity?

1523
02:10:40,578 --> 02:10:44,378
They've set up infrastructure to provide
all the basic amenities to the common man.

1524
02:10:44,582 --> 02:10:50,646
Electricity, housing board, healthy
food and free education.

1525
02:10:50,855 --> 02:10:58,227
We have one thing,
they don't have and will never have.

1526
02:10:59,597 --> 02:11:00,621
What?

1527
02:11:01,099 --> 02:11:03,397
Culture and tradition!

1528
02:11:03,601 --> 02:11:04,761
Yes, agreed.

1529
02:11:04,936 --> 02:11:10,738
And till we have that,
no one can destroy us.

1530
02:11:11,108 --> 02:11:14,737
Ours is the greatest country in the world!

1531
02:11:15,278 --> 02:11:16,074
Absolutely!

1532
02:11:16,279 --> 02:11:21,478
Culture and tradition is our strength,
don't you agree?

1533
02:11:25,455 --> 02:11:26,752
Munishwar...

1534
02:11:27,958 --> 02:11:32,657
I don't think... Mohanbabu agrees!

1535
02:11:32,796 --> 02:11:33,990
Do you Mohanji?

1536
02:11:34,965 --> 02:11:36,159
You're right.

1537
02:11:37,134 --> 02:11:40,160
I don't agree that ours is the greatest
country in the world!

1538
02:11:44,641 --> 02:11:49,840
But I do believe that we have the
potential and strength to become great.

1539
02:11:51,982 --> 02:11:56,919
Both these countries are economically,
sociologically and culturally apart.

1540
02:11:57,654 --> 02:12:02,114
I shouldn't say this but since you have
broached this topic, let me say that...

1541
02:12:02,993 --> 02:12:05,587
...whenever we suspect losing
in comparison...

1542
02:12:05,996 --> 02:12:08,260
...we clutch on to our favourite refuge...

1543
02:12:09,666 --> 02:12:10,655
...culture...

1544
02:12:11,334 --> 02:12:12,665
...and tradition!

1545
02:12:13,870 --> 02:12:15,895
America has progressed
on its own strengths.

1546
02:12:16,006 --> 02:12:17,974
They have their own culture
and own tradition.

1547
02:12:18,175 --> 02:12:21,303
It would be wrong to claim
that their culture

1548
02:12:21,511 --> 02:12:24,708
their tradition and beliefs
are inferior and ours are laudable.

1549
02:12:25,515 --> 02:12:26,709
It's wrong.

1550
02:12:28,485 --> 02:12:30,578
But I have heard that

1551
02:12:30,787 --> 02:12:36,453
there they discriminate against
members of ethnic races.

1552
02:12:36,693 --> 02:12:40,151
Yes! There are clashes sometimes.
Aren't they everywhere?

1553
02:12:40,363 --> 02:12:44,732
What is important to analyze is that
we make differences based on caste.

1554
02:12:46,736 --> 02:12:54,438
You talk as if we have created the caste,
class, religion and the social system.

1555
02:12:54,945 --> 02:12:58,938
This hierarchy of caste is ancient
as is culture and religion.

1556
02:12:59,583 --> 02:13:02,017
And colour and creed.

1557
02:13:02,219 --> 02:13:06,349
Remember, one's caste is
a thing that can never die!

1558
02:13:06,556 --> 02:13:09,684
Just because a custom is ancient,
it does not have to be right.

1559
02:13:11,061 --> 02:13:15,361
Why are you imposing your
views on us Mohanbabu?

1560
02:13:16,333 --> 02:13:18,392
I am not imposing any views.

1561
02:13:18,735 --> 02:13:23,035
I am only speaking of things I've
experienced while living here.

1562
02:13:23,807 --> 02:13:26,367
And I've realized that we keep
fighting amongst ourselves...

1563
02:13:26,476 --> 02:13:31,038
...when we must fight against illiteracy,
over-population and corruption.

1564
02:13:31,314 --> 02:13:36,047
Every day, in our streets and homes,
each one of us keeps saying

1565
02:13:36,386 --> 02:13:40,652
"The country has gone to dogs. The
country is on the path of destruction!"

1566
02:13:41,157 --> 02:13:45,218
If we keep saying this, we will
one day actually land up there.

1567
02:13:45,427 --> 02:13:47,156
You'll need to do
something to remedy this.

1568
02:13:47,263 --> 02:13:48,560
You too!

1569
02:13:48,764 --> 02:13:51,426
Not just the members of the Panchayat
but everyone in the village.

1570
02:13:53,035 --> 02:13:56,198
You are blaming the members of the
Panchayat for your problems.

1571
02:13:56,505 --> 02:14:01,568
But when you step into their shoes, you'll
do the same thing. This applies to me too!

1572
02:14:02,478 --> 02:14:04,275
The dalits blame the brahmins...

1573
02:14:04,413 --> 02:14:08,144
...and brahmins claim that their
piety is despoiled by the dalits.

1574
02:14:08,784 --> 02:14:12,083
The blacksmith and potter blame
the moneylender.

1575
02:14:13,088 --> 02:14:16,717
The land owners blame the peasants,
but they don't give them their rights.

1576
02:14:17,626 --> 02:14:20,754
In what way are we great then?

1577
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:23,694
If we have problems in the village,
we point our finger at the State...

1578
02:14:23,899 --> 02:14:28,666
...and the State at someone else.
We all are finding fault with each other!

1579
02:14:29,104 --> 02:14:32,540
The fact is that we're all to be blamed.

1580
02:14:33,142 --> 02:14:35,610
Because the problem... is us!

1581
02:14:35,945 --> 02:14:38,038
Me... you...

1582
02:14:39,114 --> 02:14:40,604
...all of us!

1583
02:14:41,383 --> 02:14:45,251
Have you lost your head?
What are you saying?

1584
02:14:45,955 --> 02:14:47,547
All I know is that...

1585
02:14:48,591 --> 02:14:52,925
...a weaver who changed his
occupation by becoming a farmer...

1586
02:14:54,163 --> 02:14:57,360
...cannot feed his family

1587
02:14:59,368 --> 02:15:02,098
or give his children an education.

1588
02:15:03,072 --> 02:15:06,439
He can only watch his kids
die of malnutrition.

1589
02:15:52,955 --> 02:15:59,190
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1590
02:15:59,795 --> 02:16:06,200
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

1591
02:16:07,202 --> 02:16:11,639
Come, O Raghu stalwart,
O lord, I beseech thee

1592
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:15,970
Adorable lord of my heart,
O my good Ram, appear

1593
02:16:16,178 --> 02:16:20,808
I recite thy Name,
hear thou O Ram and come

1594
02:16:21,016 --> 02:16:22,984
I recite thy Name,

1595
02:16:23,184 --> 02:16:26,881
hear thou O Ram and come

1596
02:16:27,088 --> 02:16:28,953
Proclaim glory of truth
by beat of drum,

1597
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:31,551
burn Lanka of sins

1598
02:16:31,826 --> 02:16:36,559
At once come, rescue me and
heed loud proclamation mine

1599
02:16:36,764 --> 02:16:43,101
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1600
02:16:43,604 --> 02:16:49,873
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

1601
02:16:59,821 --> 02:17:03,757
Forget Ram, look!
It's Ravana who hast come

1602
02:17:03,991 --> 02:17:08,325
His mighty shadow hath
spread over all quarters

1603
02:17:08,663 --> 02:17:14,329
Why dost thou recite Name of Ram?
Why dost thou sing rosary of Ram?

1604
02:17:14,635 --> 02:17:18,765
This Ram - Ram thou hast
begun by rote

1605
02:17:18,973 --> 02:17:20,235
O Sita!

1606
02:17:20,441 --> 02:17:24,468
what virtue didst thou
see in Ram to quote?

1607
02:17:25,079 --> 02:17:28,981
Who can recount all His virtues?

1608
02:17:29,217 --> 02:17:33,745
Lexicon too falleth short

1609
02:17:34,255 --> 02:17:38,214
Who can reach the summits

1610
02:17:38,459 --> 02:17:42,896
Where my adorable Ram sits

1611
02:17:43,431 --> 02:17:47,800
Ram is most excellent in this world,
unswerving in virtue

1612
02:17:48,002 --> 02:17:52,234
Most puissant yet
possessed of restraint

1613
02:17:52,440 --> 02:17:56,638
But now his restraint too
hath suffered diminution

1614
02:17:56,844 --> 02:18:01,372
O Ravana! It's not too
late to beg for mercy!

1615
02:18:01,849 --> 02:18:03,441
May the glory of truth be
proclaimed by beat of drum!

1616
02:18:03,851 --> 02:18:05,910
Lanka of sins shouldst burn

1617
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:08,347
Here cometh Ram; we bow unto Him

1618
02:18:08,556 --> 02:18:10,854
Accompanied by noble
brother Lakshmana

1619
02:18:11,058 --> 02:18:17,258
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1620
02:18:18,099 --> 02:18:27,406
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

1621
02:18:31,212 --> 02:18:35,046
Shouldst Ram possess strength;
shouldst He valour proclaim

1622
02:18:35,283 --> 02:18:39,185
Why hast He not come to rescue thee,
thy fame?

1623
02:18:39,387 --> 02:18:43,187
He whose glories thou
singeth untiring

1624
02:18:43,391 --> 02:18:47,691
Pray, where is that Ram at
this moment, uncaring?

1625
02:19:03,577 --> 02:19:07,377
Ram resides in mine heart;
Ram is mine breathing part

1626
02:19:07,581 --> 02:19:12,678
Ram is soul mine,
Ram doth my life define

1627
02:19:13,653 --> 02:19:17,384
Ram in all my moments liveth,
it's Ram in every breath

1628
02:19:17,591 --> 02:19:22,255
Ram is in every hope of mine;
Ram is in every wish and pine

1629
02:19:25,699 --> 02:19:29,567
Ram verily in compassion stayeth,
in peace too dwelleth Ram

1630
02:19:29,769 --> 02:19:34,172
Ram for sure in unity is,
progress too is glory His

1631
02:19:35,742 --> 02:19:39,576
Ram, in contemplation of devotees,
and of enemies alike liveth

1632
02:19:39,779 --> 02:19:43,545
Forsake sin, O Ravana! And thou
shalt find Ram in thy heart

1633
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:47,652
Ram in thy heart,
Ram is in mine heart

1634
02:19:47,854 --> 02:19:51,585
Ram in thy heart,
Ram is in mine heart

1635
02:19:51,791 --> 02:19:55,750
Ram in every home and abode,
Ram at every threshold

1636
02:19:56,062 --> 02:20:00,726
Whoever shouldst oust Ravana
from the heart, to him doth Ram dart

1637
02:20:03,036 --> 02:20:10,568
Whoever shouldst oust Ravana
from the heart, to him doth Ram dart

1638
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:26,781
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1639
02:20:27,594 --> 02:20:36,525
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

1640
02:20:43,076 --> 02:20:47,945
Look Lord Ram has come,
Mine Lord Ram has come

1641
02:20:48,148 --> 02:20:52,642
Here comes the scion of the Raghu race,
Here he comes to rescue me

1642
02:20:52,852 --> 02:20:57,016
Look Lord Ram has come,
Mine Lord Ram has come

1643
02:20:57,223 --> 02:21:11,900
Here comes the scion of the Raghu race,
Here he comes to rescue me

1644
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:11,693
<i>Siyavar Ramchandra Ki... Jai!
(Glory unto Lord Ramchandra)</i>

1645
02:22:31,450 --> 02:22:35,853
The burning Ravan is looking
prettier in the darkness.

1646
02:23:10,923 --> 02:23:14,518
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

1647
02:23:14,726 --> 02:23:17,354
Quiet! Please be quiet!

1648
02:23:18,831 --> 02:23:20,423
Why do I feel that...

1649
02:23:20,933 --> 02:23:23,959
...all of you have started
enjoying living in this darkness?

1650
02:23:24,503 --> 02:23:26,368
You've adjusted to this darkness?

1651
02:23:27,539 --> 02:23:32,499
For how long are you'll going to
take your problems lying down?

1652
02:23:34,513 --> 02:23:37,038
But what else can we do, Mohanji?

1653
02:23:37,549 --> 02:23:39,915
Will you do as I ask?

1654
02:23:40,185 --> 02:23:43,712
Have you once again come up
with some strange solution?

1655
02:23:43,989 --> 02:23:45,820
Please have mercy on us!

1656
02:23:47,659 --> 02:23:49,126
Wait Munishwar...

1657
02:23:49,995 --> 02:23:51,394
What do you want us to do?

1658
02:23:51,997 --> 02:23:54,056
Is there a spring on
the nearby mountain?

1659
02:23:54,266 --> 02:23:56,325
Yes there is. So?

1660
02:23:56,535 --> 02:23:58,332
I need a hundred men.

1661
02:23:58,737 --> 02:24:00,671
A hundred men?

1662
02:24:01,039 --> 02:24:02,666
You shall have them.

1663
02:24:03,408 --> 02:24:05,740
You shall have a
hundred men!

1664
02:24:06,478 --> 02:24:07,604
Thank you Dadaji.

1665
02:24:10,983 --> 02:24:14,180
Sir, one hears lightning had struck
this spot several years ago.

1666
02:24:14,386 --> 02:24:16,251
Since then there has been
this gush of water.

1667
02:24:40,578 --> 02:24:43,206
Wonder what he's upto!

1668
02:24:46,083 --> 02:24:50,782
This is Point A1

1669
02:24:53,758 --> 02:24:56,556
We shall build a reservoir here.

1670
02:24:56,928 --> 02:24:58,896
I mean a water tank.

1671
02:24:59,096 --> 02:25:01,360
The water will be
acccumulated here.

1672
02:25:01,766 --> 02:25:05,793
From here, there will be a water pipe
which leads to Point A3.

1673
02:25:06,437 --> 02:25:11,534
A3 will have a shed with a turbine,
I mean a machine.

1674
02:25:11,776 --> 02:25:15,837
When the water falls on the turbine,
it will rotate with great speed.

1675
02:25:16,113 --> 02:25:20,846
And if all things go right,
electricity will be generated.

1676
02:25:26,324 --> 02:25:27,484
We'll form four groups.

1677
02:25:27,625 --> 02:25:30,253
The blacksmiths will cast the moulds.

1678
02:25:30,461 --> 02:25:34,420
The 2nd and 3rd group will do the
digging work for the tank and so on.

1679
02:25:34,632 --> 02:25:37,157
Now let's form the groups.

1680
02:25:37,501 --> 02:25:38,525
Quickly!

1681
02:25:38,970 --> 02:25:41,768
This boy looks promising!

1682
02:25:41,973 --> 02:25:43,838
Surely seems like.

1683
02:25:44,642 --> 02:25:48,601
Reservoir will be made here.
Length 5 metres and breadth 1 metre.

1684
02:25:48,779 --> 02:25:50,269
I mean, 5 arm's
by 1 arm's length.

1685
02:25:50,448 --> 02:25:53,212
For this we will have to clear out
all the stones and bushes.

1686
02:25:53,384 --> 02:25:55,113
Is that clear?
-Yes.

1687
02:26:07,832 --> 02:26:10,630
It's 7 feet and 6 inches.

1688
02:26:46,037 --> 02:26:47,334
Shall I try it?

1689
02:27:12,896 --> 02:27:14,488
Where's Mela Ram?

1690
02:27:16,733 --> 02:27:20,533
What is this?
- From boot to suit, total American sir!

1691
02:27:22,572 --> 02:27:23,698
But why?

1692
02:27:23,907 --> 02:27:25,397
Now that we are going to do
business together...

1693
02:27:25,642 --> 02:27:27,837
I thought that I should look
like a 40% partner!

1694
02:27:29,913 --> 02:27:33,246
This is my passport and this is
my VISA form, fully filled out!

1695
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:35,445
Once it's stamped...

1696
02:27:48,932 --> 02:27:51,196
Ballu, show him an
alternator powered 24 watts.

1697
02:27:51,434 --> 02:27:52,765
Please come in sir.

1698
02:28:22,132 --> 02:28:25,829
Here's your water, Dadaji.
- Thank you, Santaram.

1699
02:28:26,302 --> 02:28:28,600
How's the work progressing on the hill?

1700
02:28:28,805 --> 02:28:30,033
It's getting on perfectly fine.

1701
02:28:30,306 --> 02:28:32,934
How long will it take?
- It will be completed very soon.

1702
02:28:33,143 --> 02:28:34,508
You take rest!

1703
02:28:38,648 --> 02:28:41,583
I'll take your leave now.
Jai Ramji Ki!

1704
02:28:53,163 --> 02:28:57,429
By the way Vinod, will the turbine
principle work in power generation?

1705
02:28:58,001 --> 02:29:00,196
Yes. Why do you ask?

1706
02:29:00,336 --> 02:29:03,897
You know what, I am trying to
generate electricity here.

1707
02:29:04,174 --> 02:29:06,734
Electricity? What the hell
are you talking about?

1708
02:29:07,677 --> 02:29:10,373
No, no Vinod, I'm lighting a bulb here.

1709
02:29:11,514 --> 02:29:13,641
John is beginning to lose it by the day.

1710
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:15,579
Speak to him, and
buy me some more time.

1711
02:29:15,752 --> 02:29:18,482
We've started working nights.
- Common Vinod handle it for me.

1712
02:29:18,688 --> 02:29:19,985
I'll talk to you later.

1713
02:29:20,089 --> 02:29:21,818
Bye.
- Bye.

1714
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:39,233
25 x 75 is equal to...
- 1875.

1715
02:29:49,051 --> 02:29:53,852
23.3 x 33.9

1716
02:29:59,561 --> 02:30:03,190
789.87 = 790.

1717
02:30:31,493 --> 02:30:34,690
I'm about to finish this.

1718
02:30:47,943 --> 02:30:49,706
I've fallen in love with you.

1719
02:31:00,956 --> 02:31:04,255
What did you say? Come again.

1720
02:31:16,471 --> 02:31:20,202
See! Just see!

1721
02:31:20,475 --> 02:31:25,139
It's you and me, and long solitude!

1722
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:29,610
See! Just see!

1723
02:31:29,818 --> 02:31:34,846
How delicate are these shadows!

1724
02:31:35,157 --> 02:31:39,560
Listen in; heed the heartbeats

1725
02:31:39,828 --> 02:31:43,958
Listen in; heed the song of silence

1726
02:31:44,333 --> 02:31:53,298
Listen in; heed what the night hath to say

1727
02:31:53,675 --> 02:31:55,643
Night's come;

1728
02:31:55,844 --> 02:31:57,971
with desires nameless and many

1729
02:31:58,180 --> 02:32:02,446
She narrateth a hundred woes;
I listen to her epiphany

1730
02:32:02,684 --> 02:32:06,984
Night unwindeth,
unabashed stripeth her cloak

1731
02:32:07,189 --> 02:32:12,092
Pearls, scattered as it were; I pick

1732
02:32:14,028 --> 02:32:17,657
You have chanted some spell in words

1733
02:32:17,865 --> 02:32:22,928
Lamps are alit in my eyes

1734
02:32:23,204 --> 02:32:26,935
You have chanted some spell in words

1735
02:32:27,208 --> 02:32:32,043
The darkness of my
nights hath poured out

1736
02:32:36,717 --> 02:32:39,185
Melaram ready?
- Ready sir.

1737
02:32:39,553 --> 02:32:41,111
Release the valve.

1738
02:32:47,228 --> 02:32:52,757
Release the valve further.

1739
02:32:54,068 --> 02:32:55,194
Good!

1740
02:33:23,764 --> 02:33:26,062
The water will gush to this
turbine through this pipe.

1741
02:33:26,267 --> 02:33:28,929
The turbine will rotate with
the force of water.

1742
02:33:29,603 --> 02:33:33,004
With this steering wheel, we can
control the water flow.

1743
02:33:33,274 --> 02:33:36,209
We need to release enough water
to make this pulley rotate

1744
02:33:36,477 --> 02:33:42,245
and make this alternator spin
at the speed of 1500 rpm.

1745
02:33:42,950 --> 02:33:45,578
And if this happens,
electricity will be generated.

1746
02:33:48,289 --> 02:33:51,690
Lonely went the day
and nights sans you,

1747
02:33:51,892 --> 02:33:56,591
overcast with desolation

1748
02:33:57,531 --> 02:34:00,694
And now it seemeth the nights,
kissed by the day art perfumed

1749
02:34:00,901 --> 02:34:06,635
for you art my companion

1750
02:34:07,141 --> 02:34:16,209
I was incomplete sans you,
more complete now none couldst be

1751
02:34:16,484 --> 02:34:25,290
In yours, my world I discovered,
yet I am all lost

1752
02:34:25,493 --> 02:34:29,793
Both of us have now learned,
art of living well earned

1753
02:34:29,997 --> 02:34:34,331
Like Midas touch, our living
how well hath altered

1754
02:34:34,535 --> 02:34:39,871
Both of us have now learned,
beauty of life well earned

1755
02:34:44,011 --> 02:34:49,142
O joys, we owneth a score,
enough and more

1756
02:35:17,377 --> 02:35:18,935
What are you'll doing?

1757
02:35:20,046 --> 02:35:24,176
There will be electricity in
your house, Dadi Setu!

1758
02:35:30,156 --> 02:35:35,059
The wires are up. Now all that
we have to do is wait.

1759
02:35:35,995 --> 02:35:39,761
Ready... - Ready sir.

1760
02:35:44,771 --> 02:35:45,999
Nivaaranji ok?

1761
02:35:46,172 --> 02:35:47,298
Yes Mohanji.

1762
02:35:47,507 --> 02:35:50,704
Mela Ram, release the water.
- Ok sir.

1763
02:35:59,185 --> 02:36:00,675
Open the valve...

1764
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:02,078
Slowly...

1765
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:43,324
Electricity will be generated at 230 Volts.

1766
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,831
Come on...

1767
02:37:41,787 --> 02:37:44,847
Nivaaranji, is the valve fully open?
- Yes Mohanbabu.

1768
02:37:50,295 --> 02:37:54,061
Mela Ram, is the valve fully open?

1769
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,525
Fully open sir. Totally open.

1770
02:37:57,703 --> 02:37:59,933
Sure?
- Sure Sir.

1771
02:38:04,409 --> 02:38:07,606
Gita, come.
Hold the steering.

1772
02:38:08,413 --> 02:38:09,505
Hold it.

1773
02:38:28,333 --> 02:38:30,733
If the valve is fully open,
how come there's no pressure?

1774
02:39:21,386 --> 02:39:22,546
Has the pressure increased?

1775
02:39:22,721 --> 02:39:24,052
Yes!

1776
02:39:48,413 --> 02:39:50,506
Jafarbhai, how many rpm?

1777
02:39:53,919 --> 02:39:55,443
800 sir.

1778
02:40:25,783 --> 02:40:28,343
I say, how long now for the electricity?

1779
02:40:28,619 --> 02:40:31,315
Have patience Munishwar, patience!

1780
02:41:07,158 --> 02:41:08,716
Electricity!

1781
02:41:24,508 --> 02:41:26,100
Electricity.

1782
02:41:52,870 --> 02:41:55,464
Mohanbabu, we have done it.

1783
02:41:55,706 --> 02:41:59,472
Electricity of our own village!
Generated with our toil and sweat.

1784
02:41:59,877 --> 02:42:03,506
Just like this project, we must
think of newer and innovative ways

1785
02:42:03,714 --> 02:42:05,807
to solve our village problems.

1786
02:42:06,050 --> 02:42:11,249
Sarpanchji, come quickly!
Dadaji's health has deteriorated.

1787
02:42:23,734 --> 02:42:24,996
Dadaji...

1788
02:42:31,909 --> 02:42:34,275
Electricity? Is it here?

1789
02:42:35,913 --> 02:42:37,175
Yes.

1790
02:42:42,919 --> 02:42:44,580
The day...

1791
02:42:45,088 --> 02:42:46,521
...I saw you...

1792
02:42:47,924 --> 02:42:49,016
...I felt...

1793
02:42:50,593 --> 02:42:54,654
...something special about you...

1794
02:43:02,605 --> 02:43:04,368
Now that you're here...

1795
02:43:06,276 --> 02:43:08,244
...I can...

1796
02:43:08,711 --> 02:43:12,579
...die in peace.

1797
02:44:21,017 --> 02:44:24,145
But Mohan, you've already been away
for five weeks. This really isn't right..

1798
02:44:24,354 --> 02:44:28,415
I'm extremely sorry John. I've just been
caught up with some personal work and...

1799
02:44:28,691 --> 02:44:33,321
We are in Phase II of Core design here.
There can't be any further delays!

1800
02:44:33,529 --> 02:44:37,590
I understand John. I've just finished
what I needed to do here and

1801
02:44:38,368 --> 02:44:39,960
I'll be back in three days.

1802
02:44:40,370 --> 02:44:44,898
Three days it is!
- Of course John. Yes... I will.

1803
02:45:06,729 --> 02:45:10,028
What surprises me is how you
can think of going

1804
02:45:10,233 --> 02:45:13,031
after all that you have seen
and learnt here.

1805
02:45:13,569 --> 02:45:14,831
It's true Gita.

1806
02:45:15,405 --> 02:45:18,272
I have learnt so much here,
gained so much here.

1807
02:45:18,741 --> 02:45:20,641
Felt the problems here...

1808
02:45:22,244 --> 02:45:23,905
...but I cannot live here.

1809
02:45:24,913 --> 02:45:27,211
And I cannot live out of this country.

1810
02:45:30,085 --> 02:45:32,246
I am willing to marry you...

1811
02:45:32,921 --> 02:45:35,048
...but I won't go to America.

1812
02:45:56,278 --> 02:45:58,508
I know that you are not going to
come with me.

1813
02:45:59,781 --> 02:46:03,444
Mohan, I've given it lot of thought.

1814
02:46:04,619 --> 02:46:13,527
At this age, I'll not be able to adopt the
ways and customs of another country.

1815
02:46:14,463 --> 02:46:18,957
I am happy here.

1816
02:46:22,971 --> 02:46:24,836
Now that you are leaving...

1817
02:46:28,143 --> 02:46:31,306
...I will miss you very much.

1818
02:46:34,483 --> 02:46:38,180
If you were here, our family
would have been complete.

1819
02:47:08,049 --> 02:47:09,243
I'll take your leave.

1820
02:47:09,518 --> 02:47:10,917
May you live a long life son!

1821
02:47:13,021 --> 02:47:16,218
We had forgotten that you were a guest.

1822
02:47:16,525 --> 02:47:19,358
A visitor must leave one day.

1823
02:47:26,535 --> 02:47:28,799
We'll miss you very much.

1824
02:47:31,706 --> 02:47:33,298
When you come here next

1825
02:47:33,542 --> 02:47:37,672
you'll surely find Internet
in Charanpur Post Office.

1826
02:47:37,879 --> 02:47:40,143
Every little lad will email you.

1827
02:47:40,882 --> 02:47:44,147
What we couldn't have,
is our wrestling match.

1828
02:47:48,890 --> 02:47:52,621
I am sorry Mela Ram that
I have to leave suddenly.

1829
02:47:52,894 --> 02:47:56,352
But I'll surely send you
the sponsorship papers.

1830
02:47:57,232 --> 02:48:00,167
I don't need them anymore.
I'll be fine here.

1831
02:48:01,569 --> 02:48:05,198
Your presence in the village has
changed some things around here.

1832
02:48:05,573 --> 02:48:07,302
Some things have definitely changed.

1833
02:48:07,575 --> 02:48:10,669
But you had planned your migration.

1834
02:48:10,911 --> 02:48:14,711
When the creeper in your house crosses
into your neighbor's compound...

1835
02:48:14,915 --> 02:48:17,110
...one's own house is ruined.

1836
02:48:17,418 --> 02:48:23,948
It's like a lamp on your threshold
giving light to the neighbour's house.

1837
02:48:24,258 --> 02:48:25,816
All the best Sir.

1838
02:48:26,994 --> 02:48:28,552
Thank you Mela Ram.

1839
02:48:40,941 --> 02:48:43,705
Mohanbhaiyya, this is for you.

1840
02:48:51,452 --> 02:48:53,215
I will put this up in my house.

1841
02:48:53,587 --> 02:48:56,920
Listen, study well.
Right!

1842
02:49:16,977 --> 02:49:18,069
Where is Gita?

1843
02:49:18,479 --> 02:49:21,243
I haven't seen her around since morning.

1844
02:49:23,651 --> 02:49:25,016
I have to leave now.

1845
02:49:25,319 --> 02:49:27,879
Or else I'll miss my flight.
- Ok.

1846
02:49:28,489 --> 02:49:30,150
Please explain to her, ok?

1847
02:49:33,327 --> 02:49:41,598
Go son! My love and blessings
are always with you.

1848
02:49:49,009 --> 02:49:50,909
Don't worry...

1849
02:49:58,018 --> 02:49:59,417
Bye.

1850
02:50:52,071 --> 02:50:53,629
Gita, you're impossible!

1851
02:50:53,906 --> 02:50:55,430
You're here and...

1852
02:50:56,409 --> 02:50:58,741
...I've been looking for you all over.

1853
02:51:00,413 --> 02:51:03,246
I did not want to talk to you
before the villagers.

1854
02:51:05,084 --> 02:51:07,575
I'm saddened with your decision

1855
02:51:08,755 --> 02:51:11,155
but I can understand your predicament.

1856
02:51:12,525 --> 02:51:13,958
I can understand.

1857
02:51:16,262 --> 02:51:19,390
Gita, I too understand...

1858
02:51:20,933 --> 02:51:24,767
...but please don't mistake
my helplessness for betrayal.

1859
02:51:25,605 --> 02:51:28,699
I did not mean to hurt you...
- Mohan.

1860
02:51:29,942 --> 02:51:32,001
I love you.

1861
02:51:32,779 --> 02:51:36,510
I want you to be happy wherever you are.

1862
02:51:38,785 --> 02:51:39,979
This is for you.

1863
02:51:43,990 --> 02:51:45,389
What is this?

1864
02:51:45,658 --> 02:51:46,989
Open it.

1865
02:51:55,301 --> 02:51:57,030
What's all this?

1866
02:51:59,138 --> 02:52:01,936
The summation of all our traditions!

1867
02:52:02,575 --> 02:52:05,271
Little flowers of our profound faith!

1868
02:52:06,646 --> 02:52:08,273
Our fields...

1869
02:52:08,548 --> 02:52:10,209
...our greenery...

1870
02:52:10,416 --> 02:52:11,678
...rivers...

1871
02:52:12,185 --> 02:52:14,085
...our culture...

1872
02:52:18,191 --> 02:52:21,024
...all these will keep reminding you of us!

1873
02:52:21,894 --> 02:52:23,452
And maybe...

1874
02:52:24,831 --> 02:52:28,028
...maybe compel you to return!

1875
02:53:39,204 --> 02:53:40,933
Please stop! Don't go!

1876
02:54:40,298 --> 02:54:45,998
And as we can see, we have some points
here that the satellite travels

1877
02:54:46,204 --> 02:54:50,436
along the way to capture data
of the Global Precipitation.

1878
02:54:50,642 --> 02:54:54,601
Next we're going to see the territory
of the GPM instrument,

1879
02:54:54,813 --> 02:55:00,479
as it goes from Australia to India

1880
02:55:56,874 --> 02:56:00,435
This country, thy soil

1881
02:56:00,644 --> 02:56:04,045
It's thy motherland!

1882
02:56:04,381 --> 02:56:10,684
She calls thee

1883
02:56:11,822 --> 02:56:17,818
This is a bond that can
never be severed

1884
02:56:24,802 --> 02:56:28,329
The scent of the soil:

1885
02:56:28,672 --> 02:56:31,835
How canst thou fail to remember?

1886
02:56:32,076 --> 02:56:39,175
No matter where thou wanderest
Thou art bound to return

1887
02:56:39,416 --> 02:56:42,874
From newer paths thou toureth

1888
02:56:43,320 --> 02:56:46,778
From thy sighs hushed.

1889
02:56:46,990 --> 02:56:50,323
From thy forlorn heart

1890
02:56:50,527 --> 02:56:53,155
Some one shalt beckon

1891
02:56:53,363 --> 02:56:56,855
This country, thy soil

1892
02:56:57,167 --> 02:57:00,500
It's thy motherland!

1893
02:57:00,838 --> 02:57:05,298
She calls thee

1894
02:57:05,509 --> 02:57:11,505
This is a bond that can
never be severed

1895
02:57:32,803 --> 02:57:36,261
To thee hast thy life

1896
02:57:36,473 --> 02:57:39,704
Words to proclaim:

1897
02:57:40,010 --> 02:57:43,707
Thou hast gained all

1898
02:57:43,914 --> 02:57:47,315
What dearth to name hath thou?

1899
02:57:47,584 --> 02:57:50,985
All the happiness hath
showered, though:

1900
02:57:51,188 --> 02:57:54,385
Thou art far away from thy home

1901
02:57:54,625 --> 02:57:57,958
Come, return O wanderer

1902
02:57:58,028 --> 02:58:02,124
Where someone wouldst
name thou a kin

1903
02:58:02,366 --> 02:58:09,033
And summon thee to the native soil

1904
02:58:09,239 --> 02:58:12,299
This country, thy soil

1905
02:58:13,010 --> 02:58:16,241
Is thy motherland!

1906
02:58:16,713 --> 02:58:21,150
She calls thee

1907
02:58:21,351 --> 02:58:26,687
This is a bond that can
never be severed

1908
02:58:26,990 --> 02:58:33,122
Now that you're here...
I can... die in peace!

1909
02:58:33,329 --> 02:58:38,232
It is like a lamp on your threshold
giving light to your neighbor's house.

1910
02:58:38,601 --> 02:58:42,731
I've made up my mind, Vinod.
I must go back.

1911
02:58:43,439 --> 02:58:44,736
Not again!

1912
02:58:45,241 --> 02:58:48,699
How can you go back for a girl?
Just persuade her to come here.

1913
02:58:48,911 --> 02:58:50,435
Its not that Vinod!

1914
02:58:50,713 --> 02:58:53,204
It's not only about
Gita and Kaveriamma.

1915
02:58:56,152 --> 02:58:59,315
This is the moment decreed

1916
02:58:59,655 --> 02:59:03,147
In which concealeth

1917
02:59:03,459 --> 02:59:06,758
Full eon

1918
02:59:07,163 --> 02:59:10,030
entire existence

1919
02:59:10,233 --> 02:59:17,605
Don't thou dare ask why roads two
Cross thy path through

1920
02:59:17,807 --> 02:59:24,975
Thou art the one to resolve the road
Thou art the one to discern the code

1921
02:59:25,181 --> 02:59:32,417
Which direction? Whither dost the
path leadeth to true abode?

1922
02:59:32,622 --> 02:59:35,989
This country, thy soil

1923
02:59:36,359 --> 02:59:40,489
It's thy motherland!

1924
02:59:40,997 --> 02:59:46,299
She calls thee

1925
02:59:46,502 --> 02:59:52,407
This is a bond that can never be severed

1926
02:59:53,409 --> 02:59:54,569
I got it.

1927
02:59:54,810 --> 02:59:56,539
Just because you lit a bulb

1928
02:59:56,746 --> 02:59:59,476
now you have delusions of sparking
a revolution in the whole country.

1929
03:00:03,085 --> 03:00:05,485
You're being foolishly romantic!

1930
03:00:08,658 --> 03:00:09,852
Let's leave aside sentiments...

1931
03:00:10,092 --> 03:00:12,151
Have you figured out what you are
going to do there?

1932
03:00:13,462 --> 03:00:15,862
I have a few ideas.
- Like?

1933
03:00:16,966 --> 03:00:22,097
I could be a Project Manager for
Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre.

1934
03:00:22,305 --> 03:00:24,739
I can... I can work in tandem
with NASA from there.

1935
03:00:25,174 --> 03:00:26,732
There's a lot to be done there.

1936
03:00:27,109 --> 03:00:30,636
You're impossible.
I can't understand you!

1937
03:00:31,914 --> 03:00:34,940
If you can't understand
even after hearing all this...

1938
03:00:35,951 --> 03:00:38,010
...then its pointless telling you anything.

1939
03:00:39,322 --> 03:00:41,517
You'll have to come there and see things.

1940
03:00:42,992 --> 03:00:45,256
Otherwise you'll never understand!

1941
03:01:04,613 --> 03:01:09,482
We're just a few minutes away from the
launch of the GPM Spacecraft

1942
03:01:09,684 --> 03:01:11,208
on an important scientific mission to

1943
03:01:11,419 --> 03:01:14,980
better understand the global water
cycle here on earth.

1944
03:01:16,691 --> 03:01:20,787
GPM will allow improvements in
predicting precipitation forecasts,

1945
03:01:20,995 --> 03:01:22,986
and better predict flood hazards.

1946
03:01:23,298 --> 03:01:26,825
We are not tracking any technical
problems at this time.

1947
03:01:27,035 --> 03:01:29,970
All systems are GO on the launch vehicle.

1948
03:01:30,405 --> 03:01:33,602
Weather forecast is very good for today.

1949
03:01:34,609 --> 03:01:38,841
Just a few minutes away from
launching the GPM spacecraft.

1950
03:01:39,047 --> 03:01:41,948
This spacecraft will give us information...

1951
03:01:42,150 --> 03:01:45,551
...that will help us
better predict precipitation

1952
03:01:50,091 --> 03:01:53,117
In addition, we can
better predict flood hazards.

1953
03:01:53,962 --> 03:01:56,624
T minus 20 secs.

1954
03:02:09,244 --> 03:02:11,906
T minus 15 secs.

1955
03:02:14,349 --> 03:02:20,618
T minus 109876

1956
03:02:20,822 --> 03:02:23,916
We have a GO for main engine start

1957
03:02:24,325 --> 03:02:28,489
32 booster ignition...

1958
03:02:30,765 --> 03:02:32,858
...and Lift-Off!

1959
03:03:21,249 --> 03:03:22,876
John I tried to knock some
sense into his head

1960
03:03:23,084 --> 03:03:25,814
and tried to convince him
not to leave but...

1961
03:03:28,590 --> 03:03:31,559
Mohan, you do realize
what you are going to lose.

1962
03:03:31,793 --> 03:03:35,889
John, I know what
I'm going to gain.

1963
03:03:36,231 --> 03:03:39,758
But you're aware, you could
have gone places.

1964
03:03:41,636 --> 03:03:43,570
I am going places!

1965
03:03:47,609 --> 03:03:52,546
All right Mohan. Go light your bulb!

1966
03:04:48,001 --> 03:04:50,162
Nobody has ever thrown me like this.

1967
03:04:50,537 --> 03:04:52,562
Where did you learn
these wrestling tricks, Mohanbabu?

1968
03:04:52,940 --> 03:04:55,909
Where there is a will, there is a way.

1969
03:04:56,043 --> 03:05:00,139
After all, a marshmelon changes its colour
in company of another marshmelon!

1970
03:05:00,314 --> 03:05:01,747
Do you understand now?

1971
03:05:06,887 --> 03:05:10,186
Excellent match, Mohanbabu.
