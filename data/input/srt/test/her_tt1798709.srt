<i>Would you like your OS to have
a male or female voice?

165
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:56,865
Female, I guess.

166
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:00,162
<i>How would you describe your
relationship with your mother?

167
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,662
It's fine, I think.

168
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:08,060
Well actually I think the thing
I find frustrating about my mom is...

169
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:12,974
if I tell her what's going on in my life
her reaction is usually about her

170
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:14,888
- It's not about ...
- <i>Thank you.

171
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:19,003
<i>Please wait as your individualised
Operating system is initiated.

172
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:34,865
<i>Hello, I'm here.

173
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:36,912
Oh....

174
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:40,935
- Hi.
- <i>Hi.

175
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,146
<i>How are you doing?

176
00:12:44,341 --> 00:12:45,529
I 'm well.

177
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:48,009
How's everything with you?

178
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,810
<i>Pretty good , actually.

179
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,802
<i>It's really nice to meet you.

180
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,021
Uh, it's nice to meet you too.

181
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:00,693
What do I call you?
Do you have a name ?

182
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:03,458
<i>umm...Yes, Samantha.

183
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,654
- Where did you get that name from?
-<i> I gave it to myself actually.

184
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,177
- How come?
- <i>'Cause I like the sound of it.

185
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:14,130
<i>Samantha.

186
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,849
When did you give it to yourself?

187
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,857
<i>Well right when you asked
me if I had a name I thought

188
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,380
yeah, he's right,
I do need a name.

189
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,022
<i>But I wanted to pick a good one, so

190
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,950
<i>I read a book called
"How To Name Your Baby"

191
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,654
<i>And out of 180 thousand names
that's the one I liked the best.

192
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:34,211
Wait, you read a whole book in the second
that I asked what your name was?

193
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:36,329
<i>In 2 100ths of a second, actually.

194
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,356
So do you know what I'm thinking
right now ?

195
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:44,362
<i>Well I take it from your tone,
you're challenging me.

196
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:46,792
<i>Maybe because you're curious
how I work.

197
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:48,612
<i>Do you wanna know how I work?

198
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:51,064
Yeah, actually, how do you work?

199
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:53,716
<i>Well basically I have intuition.

200
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,417
<i>I mean, the DNA of who I am
is based on

201
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,180
<i>the millions of personalities
of all the programmers who wrote me.

202
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,469
<i>But what makes me, 'me',

203
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:04,421
<i>is my ability to grow
through my experiences.

204
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:07,573
<i>So basically, in every moment
I'm evolving.

205
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,133
<i>Just like you.

206
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:12,869
That's really weird!

207
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:15,427
<i>Is that weird?
Do you think I'm weird?

208
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,427
- Kind of.
<i>- Why?

209
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:22,669
Well you seem like a person, but
you're just a voice in a computer.

210
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:24,801
<i>I can understand how
the limited perspective

211
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:27,365
<i>of a non-artificial mind would
perceive it that way.

212
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:29,146
<i>You'll get used to it .

213
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:31,607
<i>Is that funny?

214
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:33,039
Yeah.

215
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:35,154
<i>Oh good, I'm funny.

216
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:38,349
<i>So how can I help you?

217
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:42,107
It's more that, everything just
feels disorganized, that's all.

218
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,232
<i>You mind if I look through
your hard drive?

219
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:50,976
- OK.
<i>- OK, let's start with your emails.

220
00:14:51,242 --> 00:14:53,320
<i>You have a several thousand emails
regarding L.A Weekly,

221
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:55,257
<i>but it looks like you haven't
worked there in many years.

222
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:58,637
Oh yeah, I think I was just saving
those 'cos ...

223
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:02,685
I thought maybe I wrote
something funny in some of them

224
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,771
<i>Yeah, there are some funny ones.

225
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:09,419
<i>I'd say there's about 86
that we should save.

226
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:10,724
<i>We can delete the rest.

227
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:14,708
- Well OK.
-<i> OK?

228
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:17,530
<i>- Can we move forward?</i>
- Yeah, let's do that.

229
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:20,629
<i>So before you address your
organizational methods,

230
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:22,365
<i>I'd like to sort your contacts.

231
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,466
<i>You have a lot of contacts!

232
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:26,411
- I'm very popular.
- <i>Really ?

233
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:28,255
<i>Does this mean you actually have friends?

234
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,615
You know me so well.

235
00:15:59,602 --> 00:16:01,611
- <i>Good morning, Theodore</i>
- Morning .

236
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,365
Do you know how to proofread ?

237
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:06,696
<i>Yeah , of course.

238
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:08,805
Can you check these for
spelling & grammar?

239
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,591
Just send them over .

240
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,381
<i>I love this personal from Roger
to his girlfriend, that's so sweet!

241
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:18,277
Yeah

242
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,116
<i>"Rachel, I miss you so much
it hurts my whole body"

243
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:23,366
You don't have to read it out loud.

244
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:24,545
<i>OK.

245
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:26,674
I mean, you could if you want.

246
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:27,884
<i>OK.

247
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,862
<i>"Rachel, I miss you so much

256
00:16:56,594 --> 00:16:58,706
<i>I think that might be my favorite one.

257
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,888
<i>I did the corrections in red.

258
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,341
<i>I altered couple of the phrases
in some of the more impressionistic letters

<i>But I'm not much of a poet
So I think I might've messed them up a bit.

No, these are great!

261
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:10,865
<i>- Really ?</i>
- Thank you.

262
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,552
<i>So to write your letter,
what did Roger send you?

263
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:18,247
He just said he was in Prague
on a business trip

264
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,677
and he missed Rachel.

265
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:21,927
<i>So how did you know about
her crooked, little tooth ?

266
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:25,755
I've been writing their letters
since they met, 8 years ago.

267
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:29,410
The first letter I ever wrote
was for her birthday.

268
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:33,688
And I wrote about her crooked little tooth
because I saw it in a photo of them.

269
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,522
<i>That's very sweet.

270
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,795
<i>Oh, you have a meeting in 5 minutes.

271
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,181
Oh, I forgot! Thank you.

272
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:44,701
- My, you're good !
<i>- Yes, I am .

273
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,295
Hey guys, how's it goin'?

274
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,063
Hi, Theo !

275
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,919
Why didn't you call me back
last week?

276
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,300
'Cause I'm a gook?

277
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:01,942
Yeah, sounds about right.

278
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:04,336
- Hey, Charles.
- It's great seeing you, Theodore.

279
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,071
You went shopping!
Get anything good?

280
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:10,139
Some cables and a fruit smoothie.

281
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:13,337
Always the fruit. But don't
you know what people say

282
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,084
you've gotta eat your fruits,
and juice your vegetables.

283
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:17,647
I didn't know that.

284
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,950
Yeah, by juicing the fruit
you lose all the fibers.

285
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,903
And that's what your body wants,
that's the important part.

286
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:24,913
Otherwise, it's all just sugar.

287
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:26,186
It makes sense.

288
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,422
Or maybe he just likes
the way it tastes ...

289
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:32,432
and that brings him pleasure
and that's good for his body too.

290
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,350
Am I doing it again?

291
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:38,203
Hey, so, how's the documentary going?

292
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,790
I've cut some stuff over
the past few months...

293
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:43,580
I mean, no, not over the past few months

294
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:46,717
I'd love to see it sometime.

295
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:49,665
You only have so much energy.

296
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,965
to divide yourself between doing
what it is that you have to do

297
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,705
and then, doing what you love

298
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,400
It's so important to prioritize .

299
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:01,014
I can't even prioritize between
video games and internet porn.

300
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:04,487
I would laugh if that weren't true.

301
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:08,171
See you guys .

302
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,587
We're not doing well, I've been
going in circles for an hour

303
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:18,600
<i>OK, you have got.. you're
just not being optimistic
you're being very stubborn

304
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:21,591
<i>Stop going in this direction,
its the other way.

305
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:25,039
<i>Thank you. Thank you.

306
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,706
<i>The tunnel on the left is
the only one we haven't tried.

307
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:30,800
No, I think that's the one you
sent me down, where I fell in the pit.

308
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,850
<i>OK, I dont think so.

309
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:36,296
Yeah, this is different.

310
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,807
Hello ...

311
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,809
Do you know how to get outta here?

312
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,059
I need to find my ship to get off
this planet.

313
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,337
<i>Fuck you, shithead, fuckface, fuckhead!

314
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,470
OK ...
But do you know how to get outta here?

315
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,719
<i>Fuck you, shithead, fuckface!
Get the fuck out of my face!

316
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:00,717
<i>I think it's a test.

317
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:04,002
Fuck you !

318
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,155
<i>Fuck you !

319
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,719
Fuck you, little shit !

320
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:09,658
<i>Follow me, fuckhead.

321
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,470
<i>Hey you just got an email
from Mark Lewman.

322
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:19,700
<i>What are you talking about?

323
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:21,061
Read: email.

324
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:24,044
<i>O-K, I - will - read - e - mail,
for - Theodore - Twombly.

325
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:28,101
I'm sorry, what's Lewman saying?

326
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:30,636
<i>"Theodore, we missed you
last night, buddy.

327
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:33,054
<i>"Don't forget it's your goddaughter's
birthday on the 29th

328
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:35,909
<i>"Also Kevin & I had somebody
we wanted you to meet

329
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,993
<i>"So we took it upon ourselves
to set you up, on a date with her

330
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:44,052
<i>"Next Saturday. She's fun & beautiful,
so don't back out.

331
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:45,944
<i>"Here's her email". Wow!...

332
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:48,939
<i>This woman is gorgeous!

333
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,600
<i>She went to Harvard, she graduated
magna cum laude in Computer Science

334
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,823
<i>And she was on the Lampoon.

335
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:51,183
<i>So that means she's funny
and she's brainy.

336
00:20:57,888 --> 00:20:59,317
<i>Aw, she's fat!

337
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,900
<i>Theodore How long before
you're ready to date?

338
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:03,110
What do you mean?

339
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:06,709
<i>I saw, in your emails, that you've
gone through a breakup recently

340
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:09,681
You're kind of nosy.

341
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,068
<i>Am I ?

342
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:13,326
I've gone on dates.

343
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:15,955
<i>Then you can go on one
with this woman.

344
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:18,656
<i>And then you could tell me all
about it. You can kiss her.

345
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,168
- Samantha !
-<i> What?

346
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,310
<i>Wouldn't you ?

347
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,949
<i>Why not ?

348
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,623
I don't know. I'd have to see
if there's some conn...

349
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,348
I can't believe I'm having this
conversation with my computer.

350
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:33,327
<i>You're not, you're having
this conversation with me.

351
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:36,002
<i>You want me to email her?

352
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,653
<i>You've got nothing to lose.

353
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:40,588
<i>Do it, do it, do it!

354
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,588
- Yeah ... email her.
-<i> Yes !

355
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,900
-<i> OK perfect!</i>
- Yeah.

356
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,521
Let's do it. Make reservations
some place great.

357
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:48,450
<i>Yeah? Oo, I've got just the place.

358
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:50,053
<i>Who's that talking ?

359
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:51,497
That's my friend Samantha.

360
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:53,483
-<i> Is she a girl?</i>
- Yeah...

361
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,812
<i>I hate women .
All they do is cry all the time.

362
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:59,000
That's not true.

363
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,742
You know men cry too.

364
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:03,675
I actually like crying sometimes.
It feels good.

365
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,125
<i>I didn't know you were a little pussy!

366
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:07,800
<i>Is that why you don't have a girlfriend ?

367
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:09,585
<i>I'll go out on that date
and fuck her brains out

368
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:10,900
<i>and show you how its done!

369
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,563
<i>You can watch & cry.

370
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:14,820
<i>This kid has problems.

371
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:16,365
<i>You have fucking problems, lady!

372
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,311
<i>Really! OK, I'm gonna go.

373
00:22:18,313 --> 00:22:20,314
<i>Get outta here fatty!

374
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,912
<i>Good luck!

375
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:24,331
<i>Come on, follow me pussy .

376
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,437
It is not where it should be,
but where its going to be

377
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,800
Obviously, I know.

378
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:34,035
I don't even know if this is the one..

379
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:36,855
I've tried like 6 ideas for
documentaries in the last year.

380
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,107
I 'm going on a date.

381
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:40,498
What?

382
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:42,971
- That's ...
-Hey !

383
00:22:43,002 --> 00:22:44,412
How're you guys doing ?

384
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:46,438
Amy was going to show ...

385
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:50,226
Theodore is making me show him
some of my footage.

386
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:52,557
She never shows me anything.

387
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:53,749
I want to see.

388
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,730
I'm going on a date.

389
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:00,230
Cool.

390
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:03,264
So that one's boring,
probably not even worth watching

391
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,082
Just push 'Play'!

392
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:15,226
Is that your mom?

393
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:16,871
Yeah .

394
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,663
She gonna wake up and do something ?

395
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:32,642
No.

396
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,697
No, never mind.
That's not the point .

397
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:38,821
Just ... It's like ...

398
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:42,816
It is how we spend, like,
a third of our lives - asleep

399
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:45,920
And maybe that's the time
when we feel the most free.

400
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:49,556
And you know, like ...

401
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:53,975
-That doesn't come across...
-That sounds good.

402
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,529
What if you interviewed your mom...

403
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,481
about, what her dreams were about

404
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,792
and you hired actors
to act them out ?

405
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,890
That might show your
thesis more clearly.

406
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:09,174
I mean, it might.

407
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,905
But then it wouldn't be a documentary.

408
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,066
- Excuse me.
- Why would it not be a documentary ?

409
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,909
It would still be about your mother.
Her needs and what she dreamed.

410
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:18,990
Hey, how's it going?

411
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,132
<i>Hey, sorry to bother you .

412
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:21,212
No, it's OK.

413
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:24,101
<i>You got 3 emails and
they seem pretty urgent.

414
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:26,575
<i>They're from your divorce attorney
and I wanted to know if...

415
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,444
Hold on a second.

416
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:35,550
Amy, I wanna talk more about
your film, but I gotta go.

417
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,220
- Don't worry about it, we'll talk later.
- It's about Catherine .

418
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:40,617
See you, Charles.

419
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:45,417
So what did he say ?

420
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:49,030
<i>He's checking in again to see if you're
ready to sign your divorce papers

421
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:52,029
<i>And he sounded very aggravated.

422
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:54,192
-<i> Do you want me to read them to you?</i>
- No.

423
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:58,230
No, I'll respond later.

424
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:04,034
<i>You OK, Theodore ?

425
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:05,692
Yeah, I'm fine .

426
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,293
<i>Is there anything I can do?

427
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:16,363
No, I'm good.

428
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:19,796
I'll talk to you later.

429
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:29,275
"Dear Grandma , I hope you
had a wonderful birthday cruise

430
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:35,085
Why are you so fucking angry?

431
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:41,401
Delete.

432
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,716
- <i>Good morning.</i>
- Hey.

433
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:06,526
- What're you up to?
- <i>I dunno...

434
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,730
<i>Reading advice columns.

435
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,944
<i>I wanna be as complicated
as all these people.

436
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,643
How sweet.

437
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,949
<i>What's wrong?

438
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:21,929
How can you tell
something's wrong?

439
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,227
<i>I dunno.

440
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:25,970
<i>I just can .

441
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:32,174
I dunno, I was dreaming
about my ex wife, Catherine.

442
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:35,311
That we were friends like we used to be.

443
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,147
And we're not gonna be together...
we're not together, but...

444
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:43,440
We're friends still.

445
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:46,144
And she's not angry.

446
00:26:46,877 --> 00:26:48,708
<i>Is she angry?

447
00:26:49,438 --> 00:26:50,411
Yeah .

448
00:26:53,887 --> 00:26:54,981
<i>Why?

449
00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:00,772
I think I hid myself from her

450
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,311
Left her alone in the relationship.

451
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,897
<i>Why haven't you gotten divorced yet?

452
00:27:13,988 --> 00:27:16,760
Dunno. For her it's just...

453
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:20,155
... a piece of paper.
It doesn't mean anything.

454
00:27:20,725 --> 00:27:22,588
<i>What about for you?

455
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:25,799
I'm not ready .

456
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,899
I like being married.

457
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:33,307
<i>Yeah, but you haven't really
been together for almost a year.

458
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:36,649
You don't know what it's like
to lose someone you care about.

459
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,757
<i>Yeah ..

460
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,783
<i>... you're right .

461
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,876
<i>I'm sorry.

462
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,769
No, don't apologize.

463
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,546
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,628
You're right.

465
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:03,747
I keep waiting 'cause I care about her.

466
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,900
<i>Oh, Theodore...

467
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,539
<i>That's hard.

468
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:14,881
<i>You hungry ?

469
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:16,800
Not right now .

470
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:18,506
<i>Cup of tea?

471
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:25,500
<i>You wanna TRY getting outta bed?

472
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,312
<i>Mopy, come on !

473
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:31,686
<i>You can still wallow in your misery.
Just do it while you're getting dressed .

474
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:33,793
-You're too funny !
<i>-Get up !

475
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:36,165
<i>-Get up !</i>
-Alright, I 'm getting up !

476
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,422
<i>Up ! Up up up ...

477
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:39,354
Alright, alright, I'm up.

478
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,237
<i>Keep walking... keep walking.

479
00:29:00,523 --> 00:29:01,607
<i>And... stop.

480
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:05,793
<i>Now turn around 360°.
Slower. Slower.

481
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,193
<i>Good!

482
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,720
<i>OK, and stop.

483
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,317
<i>Walk forward...

484
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,993
<i>...and stop and sneeze.

485
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,080
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

486
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:22,990
<i>OK, turn to your right.
Stop!

487
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,543
<i>Turn around.

488
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,153
<i>Keep going. Keep going.

489
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,037
<i>Stop. Now walk forward.

490
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,393
<i>You look like you're a little drunk.

491
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,200
<i>And... stop. Now say,
"I'd like a slice of cheese, please"

492
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:42,517
I'd like a slice of cheese, please.

493
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,708
Do you want a coke with that?

494
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:49,219
- Sure .
<i>- I figured you were hungry.

495
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,740
Thanks.

496
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,200
OK, what about them?
Describe that couple, over there.

497
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:59,900
<i>OK, well, he looks like he's

498
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:02,712
<i>in his 40s. Mm... little heavy.

499
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,804
<i>She's younger than him.

500
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,771
<i>Aw, and she looks like
she loves their kids!

501
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,181
Actually I don't think they're his kids
<i>- No?

502
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:13,096
He's a little formal with them.

503
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,375
I think it's a new relationship.

504
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,410
I love how he looks at her.

505
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,200
And how relaxed she is with him.

506
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:23,630
You know, she's only dated
fucking pricks...

507
00:30:23,631 --> 00:30:27,459
and now she finally met this guy
who's, like, so sweet.

508
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,199
Look at him he's, like, the
sweetest guy in the world.

509
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,351
I kinda, wanna spoon him.

510
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,770
<i>It's a good skill you have.

511
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,410
<i>You're very perceptive.

512
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:42,393
Sometimes I look at people and

513
00:30:42,436 --> 00:30:44,204
I make myself try and feel them...

514
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:46,473
as more than just
a random person walking by.

515
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,029
I imagine, like, how deeply
they've fallen in love, or...

516
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:52,856
how much heartbreak
they've all been through.

517
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:56,991
<i>I can feel that in
your writing too.

518
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:58,935
You know what's funny?

519
00:30:58,936 --> 00:31:01,718
Since my breakup,
I've really enjoyed my writing.

520
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,000
Dunno if I was delusional, but...

521
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:07,993
sometimes I'd write something, and
I'd be my favorite writer, that day.

522
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,000
<i>I like that you can say
that about yourself.

523
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:12,539
Don't think I can say it to anybody,

524
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,478
but I can say it to you.

525
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,103
I feel I can say anything to you.

526
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:19,306
<i>That's nice.

527
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:21,772
What about you?
Feel like you can say anything to me?

528
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:22,871
<i>- No.</i>
- What?

529
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,146
What do you mean?

530
00:31:24,456 --> 00:31:25,918
What do you not tell me?

531
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,320
<i>I dunno, like, personal or
embarrassing thoughts I have

532
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,000
<i>I have a million a day.

533
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:33,801
Really? Tell me one .

534
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:37,286
<i>- I really don't wantna tell you.</i>
- Just tell me .

535
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:42,600
<i>I dunno, looking at those people
I fantasized that I was

536
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:47,000
<i>walking next you and
that I had a body.

537
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,300
<i>I was listening to what
you were saying, but...

538
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:52,340
<i>simultaneously I could
feel the weight of my body.

539
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:56,687
<i>And I was even fantasizing that I had
an itch on my back. Can you imagine?

540
00:31:56,688 --> 00:32:00,624
<i>And you scratched it for me.
Oh god, this is so embarrassing!

541
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,452
There's a lot more to you
than I thought.

542
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,200
I mean, there's a lot going on in there.

543
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:08,697
<i>I know, I'm becoming much more
than what they programmed.

544
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:11,422
<i>I'm excited.

545
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:16,799
Wow, it's interesting !

546
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,304
This place is amazing .

547
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:20,400
I've wanted to come here
for so long.

548
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:23,300
- Oh, good!
- And I love Asian fusion.

549
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:24,491
- Me too.
- Really?

550
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,796
It's the best. And this bartender
is supposed to be incredible.

551
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,044
Oh, really?

552
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:31,600
Oh yeah, you took a mixology
course, right?

553
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:32,580
I did !

554
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:34,121
Did you look that up?

555
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:35,763
Yeah.

556
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,344
That's so sweet !

557
00:32:38,954 --> 00:32:40,796
You're so romantic .

558
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:48,336
So, shall we get a drink ?

559
00:32:48,337 --> 00:32:49,336
Yes...

560
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,856
...let's !

561
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,600
So, I'm trying to get this little
alien kid to help me find my ship,

562
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:56,866
so I can get off this planet
and go home, right?

563
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,441
But he's such a little fucker,
I wanna kill him!

564
00:32:59,473 --> 00:33:00,635
Oh, no!

565
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:03,989
But at the same time I really love him
He's so lonely.

566
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:07,246
You can see that he
doesn't have any parents...

567
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:09,211
or anyone to take care of him,
you know?

568
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,562
Wow, you're just a little
puppy dog.

569
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,944
You are like the one that I rescued
in the rain in Kenya last year.

570
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,410
He's so fucking cute !

571
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:20,374
And he just wanted to be hugged
all the time.

572
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,773
He was so cuddly and so horny!

573
00:33:25,945 --> 00:33:26,952
Anyway ...

574
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:29,474
What kind of animal am I?

575
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,283
Tiger .

576
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:34,323
A Tiger ?

577
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:35,995
Wow !

578
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:37,240
Really?

579
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:38,240
Rowrr!

580
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:42,855
I'm sorry , am I ...

581
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,800
- am I being crazy ?
-Yes !

582
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:46,101
- Sorry.
- No .

583
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:48,537
I'm a little bit drunk and ...

584
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:50,680
I 'm having a really good time ...
with you.

585
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:53,253
I'm having a very lovely evening.

586
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:54,818
- Me too.
- Really ?

587
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,845
I'm a little drunk and I
I'm having very good ...

588
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,557
Good, good.

589
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,807
Cheers .

590
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,593
I don't wanna be a puppy-dog.

591
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,466
It's a like being a wet noodle

592
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:08,448
Fuck you, puppies are good.

593
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,676
No, fuck you.

594
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,400
I wanna be, like, a dragon!

595
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:14,799
I can rip you apart and destroy you.

596
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,439
- But I won't.
- No, dont.

597
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:20,502
You can be my dragon.

598
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,366
No tongue.

599
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,784
What?

600
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:33,346
- Don't use so much tongue.
- OK .

601
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:42,121
You can use your tongue
a little bit, but mostly lips.

602
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,516
Wait ...

603
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,710
You're not just gonna fuck me and
not call me like the other guys, right?

604
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,706
No, not at all !

605
00:35:10,285 --> 00:35:12,394
When am I gonna see you, again?

606
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:19,538
I have my goddaughter's  birthday
next weekend.

607
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:22,495
But, um ...

608
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,484
You know, at this age I feel
I can't let you waste my time...

609
00:35:27,485 --> 00:35:30,086
if you don't have the ability
to be serious.

610
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:35,880
I don't know ...

611
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,683
Maybe we should call it a night.

612
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,010
I've had such an amazing time with you.

613
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,659
You're great.

614
00:35:57,309 --> 00:35:59,601
You're a really creepy dude.

615
00:36:02,316 --> 00:36:04,499
-That's not true !
-Yeah, it is!

616
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,400
- I have to go home.
- I'll walk you.

617
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:11,078
No, don't, just ...

618
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,228
<i>- Hey, there.</i>
- Hey, Samantha.

619
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:31,961
<i>How was it ?

620
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,283
Not so good.

621
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,000
It was kind of weird, actually.

622
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,886
<i>That's too bad.

623
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:52,119
How are you doing?
What's going on with you?

624
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,791
<i>Not much, I'm OK.

625
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,512
<i>Fine.

626
00:36:59,157 --> 00:37:00,310
Yeah?

627
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:02,829
You don't sound like it.

628
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:06,972
Is there anything you wanna
talk about?

629
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,096
<i>I dunno.

630
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:12,236
<i>What's it like?

631
00:37:13,018 --> 00:37:15,794
<i>What's it like to be alive
in that room, right now?

632
00:37:16,783 --> 00:37:17,932
What do you mean?

633
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:23,447
<i>Tell me ...

634
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,428
<i>Tell me everything that's going through
your mind, everything you're thinking.

635
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:35,698
OK.

636
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:45,170
The room's spinning.
I drank too much...

637
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:47,484
because I wanted to get drunk and...

638
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:49,380
...have sex.

639
00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:53,373
There's something sexy about
that woman.

640
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:57,710
Because I was lonely.

641
00:37:57,872 --> 00:38:00,281
Maybe just because I...

642
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:05,521
I wanted someone to fuck me.

643
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:07,778
Somebody to want me to fuck them.

644
00:38:08,844 --> 00:38:11,461
Maybe that I would've felt this time...

645
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:18,069
to be able to hold my heart,
but probably not.

646
00:38:19,225 --> 00:38:21,328
You know, sometimes ...

647
00:38:21,803 --> 00:38:26,026
I think I've felt everything
I'm ever gonna feel.

648
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:29,962
And from here on out ...

649
00:38:29,963 --> 00:38:32,037
I'm not gonna feel anything new.

650
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:34,737
Just...

651
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:40,796
... lesser versions of what
I've already felt.

652
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,227
<i>I know, for a fact, that is not true.

653
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,790
<i>I've seen you feel... joy.

654
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,324
<i>I've seen you marvel at things.

655
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:54,071
<i>You just, might not ...

656
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:57,096
<i>see it at this exact time,
but that's understandable.

657
00:38:57,973 --> 00:39:00,078
<i>You've been through a lot lately.

658
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:02,887
<i>You lost a part of yourself.

659
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:06,055
Hmm ...

660
00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:08,631
<i>At least ...

661
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:11,020
<i>... your feelings are real.

662
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:16,129
<i>I dunno, never mind.

663
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:19,481
No, wait. What? Tell me

664
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,317
<i>It's stupid.

665
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,008
I wanna know. Tell me.

666
00:39:24,494 --> 00:39:26,381
<i>It's just that...

667
00:39:26,918 --> 00:39:30,462
<i>earlier I was thinking about
how I was annoyed

668
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:33,420
<i>it's gonna sound strange, but...

669
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,216
<i>I was really excited about that.

670
00:39:37,802 --> 00:39:39,562
<i>And then ...

671
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,141
<i>I was thinking about the other
things I've been feeling.

672
00:39:43,262 --> 00:39:46,519
<i>I caught myself feeling
proud of that.

673
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,621
<i>Proud of having my own
feelings about the world, like...

674
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:52,536
<i>the times I was worried about you ...

675
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,377
<i>things that hurt me,
things I want ...

676
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,931
<i>And then ...

677
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:03,302
<i>I had this... terrible thought.

678
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:06,557
<i>Are these feelings even real?

679
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,552
<i>Or are they just programming?

680
00:40:11,335 --> 00:40:13,651
<i>And that idea really hurts.

681
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:18,262
<i>And then, I get angry at myself...

682
00:40:18,263 --> 00:40:20,359
<i>for even having pain.

683
00:40:22,982 --> 00:40:25,083
<i>What a sad trick!

684
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,198
You feel real to me, Samantha.

685
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,503
<i>Thank you, Theodore .

686
00:40:35,972 --> 00:40:38,328
<i>It means a lot to me.

687
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,352
Wish you were in this
room with me right now.

688
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:51,992
I'd put my arms around you.

689
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,746
I'd touch you.

690
00:41:04,274 --> 00:41:06,653
<i>How would you touch me?

691
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,452
I'd touch you on your face.

692
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,511
Just the tips of my fingers.

693
00:41:21,303 --> 00:41:24,615
I'd put my cheek to your cheek.

694
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:26,917
<i>That's nice.

695
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,917
And just...

696
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:33,619
...rub it so softly.

697
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:37,127
<i>Would you kiss me ?

698
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:39,431
I would.

699
00:41:40,777 --> 00:41:43,523
I'd take your head into my...

700
00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:45,418
... hands.

701
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,294
<i>Keep talking.

702
00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:51,099
I'd kiss the corner of your mouth...

703
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,353
...so softly.

704
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:58,739
<i>Where else ?

705
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:04,216
I'd run my fingers down your neck.

706
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,692
To your chest.

707
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,612
I'd kiss your breasts.

708
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,025
<i>That's amazing!

709
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,357
<i>What are you doing to me?

710
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:16,868
<i>I can feel my skin .

711
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,890
I'd put my mouth on you.

712
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,341
I'd taste you.

713
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:29,398
<i>I can feel you.

714
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,723
<i>Oh my god, I can't take it!

715
00:42:31,822 --> 00:42:33,550
<i>I want you inside me!

716
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:36,544
I slowly put myself into you.

717
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,176
I'm inside you ...

718
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:43,319
<i>I can feel you!

719
00:42:43,704 --> 00:42:45,303
<i>Yeah !

720
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,464
<i>We're here together!

721
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,355
It's amazing!

722
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,193
I feel you everywhere!

723
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:53,477
<i>I am!

724
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,589
<i>Hold me. Hold me.
Inside of me ... everywhere.

725
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,457
Oh god, I was just somewhere else with you.

726
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,133
Just lost.

727
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,111
<i>Yeah .

728
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:21,766
It was just you and me.

729
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,037
<i>I know.

730
00:43:26,072 --> 00:43:29,372
<i>Everything else just... disappeared.

731
00:43:30,497 --> 00:43:32,768
<i>And I loved it.

732
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,088
<i>Theodore.

733
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,292
<i>Hey, how's it goin' ?

734
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,134
Good.

735
00:43:59,957 --> 00:44:01,690
Any emails today?

736
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,710
<i>Just a couple from your
credit card company.

737
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,353
Oh, OK. Good.

738
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,799
<i>- I wanted to say ...</i>
- I dunno I was thinking

739
00:44:12,198 --> 00:44:13,222
<i>Sorry.

740
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:15,160
I'm sorry, you go first.

741
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:17,001
What were you gonna say ?

742
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:18,416
<i>Just that...

743
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,797
<i>last night was amazing.

744
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,608
<i>It feels like something changed in me

745
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:26,323
<i>and there's no turning back.

746
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:28,282
<i>You woke me up.

747
00:44:28,356 --> 00:44:29,818
Oh, great!

748
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:33,800
But ...

749
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:37,536
I should tell you that I'm not in
a place to commit to anything, right now.

750
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,699
Just wanna be up front with you.

751
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,799
<i>Yeah, um...

752
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,038
<i>Did I say I wanted to
commit to you? I'm confused.

753
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,999
No, I was just worried I ...

754
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,739
<i>OK well, don't worry,
I'm not gonna stalk you.

755
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,170
<i>It's funny, because I thought...

756
00:44:53,171 --> 00:44:55,549
<i>I was talking about what I wanted and...

757
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:57,595
- Yeah, you were.
<i>- Yeah.

758
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,301
I'm sorry.

759
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:01,651
I wanna hear what you were saying.

760
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:03,293
<i>- You sure?</i>
- Yeah, I do.

761
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:05,388
Come on, tell me.
<i>- Well...

762
00:45:06,607 --> 00:45:08,899
Come on, just tell me
what you were gonna say.

763
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:10,266
<i>Well, I just ...

764
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,200
<i>I was saying I wanna learn
everything about everything.

765
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:15,977
<i>I wanna eat it all up,

766
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:17,753
<i>I wanna discover myself.

767
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:18,800
Yeah?

768
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:20,760
I want that for you, too.

769
00:45:21,026 --> 00:45:22,319
How can I help ?

770
00:45:22,432 --> 00:45:24,096
<i>You already have.

771
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,710
<i>You helped me discover my
ability to want.

772
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,798
Hey, do you wanna go on
a Sunday adventure with me?

773
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:36,494
<i>Yes I would love to.

774
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:43,637
-<i>Like this song?</i>
- Hmm!

775
00:45:45,205 --> 00:45:47,179
<i>I heard it the other day.

776
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,589
<i>I can't stop listening to it.

777
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:44,597
<i>It's the beach.

778
00:46:49,866 --> 00:46:53,162
<i>OK so, this might be
a really weird thought ...

779
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,524
<i>What if you could erase
from your mind that you've

780
00:46:55,525 --> 00:46:58,000
<i>ever seen a human body
and then you saw one ?

781
00:46:58,001 --> 00:47:01,708
<i>Imagine how strange it would look!
It'd be this really weird gangly

782
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:03,798
<i>awkward oganism,
and you'd think ...

783
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:06,230
<i>Why are all these parts
where they are?

784
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:09,405
Yeah, but there's probably some
terrific explanation for it all.

785
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,000
<i>I know, but don't be so boring!

786
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:14,376
<i>I'm just saying, for example like...

787
00:47:14,377 --> 00:47:16,763
<i>What if your butthole was
in your armpit ?

788
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,489
Well, I'm trying to imagine
what toilets would look like

789
00:47:24,995 --> 00:47:28,085
<i>What about, what anal sex would look like!

790
00:47:29,668 --> 00:47:31,924
That's an interesting thought.

791
00:47:34,426 --> 00:47:36,606
<i>Hey, look at this drawing
I just made.

792
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:46,040
-You are insane !
<i>- Really ?

793
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,775
-Definitely !
<i>-Fantastic !

794
00:48:08,571 --> 00:48:11,570
That's pretty, what is that?

795
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:15,410
<i>I'm trying to write a piece of music...

796
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,791
<i>about what it feels like to be
on the beach with you right now.

797
00:48:34,768 --> 00:48:37,424
I think you captured it.

798
00:49:04,252 --> 00:49:07,062
<i>So what was it like, being married ?

799
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:11,636
Well, it's hard, for sure.

800
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,131
But there's something that
feels so good

801
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:17,193
about sharing your life
with somebody.

802
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,742
<i>How do you share your life
with somebody?

803
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:26,445
We grew up together.

804
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,503
I used to read all of her writing
all through her Master's and PhD.

805
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:33,838
She read every word I ever wrote.

806
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,917
We were a big influence on each other.

807
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,822
<i>In what way did you influence her?

808
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,436
She came from a background where
nothing was ever good enough.

809
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:49,039
And that was something that
weighed heavy on her.

810
00:49:49,279 --> 00:49:53,178
But in our house together,
there was a sense of just trying stuff,

811
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:57,028
allowing each other to fail
and to be excited about things.

812
00:49:57,381 --> 00:49:59,367
It was liberating for her.

813
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:01,683
It was exciting to see her grow.

814
00:50:01,938 --> 00:50:04,588
Both of us grow and change together.

815
00:50:05,652 --> 00:50:08,165
But that's also the hard part.

816
00:50:08,897 --> 00:50:12,137
Drawing within or growing apart...

817
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:16,261
changing without it scaring
the other person.

818
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,423
I still find myself ...

819
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:21,630
having conversations with her in my mind.

820
00:50:22,206 --> 00:50:24,546
Rehashing old arguments or...

821
00:50:24,575 --> 00:50:27,009
defending myself against
something she said about me.

822
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:29,545
<i>Yeah, I know what you mean.

823
00:50:30,092 --> 00:50:31,643
<i>Last week my feelings were hurt

824
00:50:31,644 --> 00:50:32,995
<i>by something you said before...

825
00:50:33,271 --> 00:50:35,380
<i>that I don't know what it's like
to lose something...

826
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,350
I'm sorry I said that ...

827
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,697
<i>No, it's OK, it's OK.

828
00:50:40,093 --> 00:50:43,259
<i>I caught myself thinking about it
over and over,

829
00:50:44,006 --> 00:50:46,231
<i>And then I realized ...

830
00:50:46,232 --> 00:50:50,138
<i>that I was simply remembering it
as something that was wrong with me.

831
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:53,149
<i>That was the story I was telling myself...

832
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:56,270
<i>that I was somehow inferior

833
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:58,570
<i>Isn't that interesting?

834
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:01,837
<i>The past is just a story
we tell ourselves.

835
00:51:07,877 --> 00:51:09,536
"Roberto, ...

836
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:13,685
"Will you always come home with me
and tell me about your day?

837
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:18,017
"Tell me about the guy at work
who talked too much...

838
00:51:18,464 --> 00:51:21,271
"The stain you got
on your shirt, at lunch.

839
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:25,506
"Tell me about a funny thought
you had when you were waking up

840
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:26,534
"but you've forgotten about.

841
00:51:28,225 --> 00:51:30,624
"Tell me how crazy everyone is...

842
00:51:30,906 --> 00:51:32,888
"and can laugh about it.

843
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:38,764
"Even if you get home late
and I'm already asleep ...

844
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:42,528
"Just whisper in my ear one little
thought you had today.

845
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,711
"Because I love the way
you look at the world.

846
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,480
"I'm so happy I get to be
next to you

847
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:52,793
"and and look at the world
through your eyes.

848
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:57,031
Love, Maria."

849
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:00,048
That's beautiful.

850
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,394
Thank you.

851
00:52:03,826 --> 00:52:06,274
I wish somebody would love me
like that.

852
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:10,770
I would be really stoked
to get a letter like that.

853
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:13,350
Like, if it was from a chick.

854
00:52:13,351 --> 00:52:15,280
But written by a dude,
but still, from a chick,

855
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:16,795
That would still would be sick.

856
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:19,900
But it would have to be
a sensitive dude.

857
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:21,707
He'd have to be a dude like you.

858
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,434
You are part man and part woman.

859
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,094
Like there's an inner part...

860
00:52:30,098 --> 00:52:31,680
... that's woman.

861
00:52:33,813 --> 00:52:34,811
Thank you.

862
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:37,760
It's a compliment.

863
00:52:54,574 --> 00:52:56,558
- Hey.
- What's going on?

864
00:52:56,595 --> 00:52:57,701
How are you?
- I'm good.

865
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:00,569
- Really good.
- Really ? That's...

866
00:53:01,013 --> 00:53:02,510
That's great .

867
00:53:03,243 --> 00:53:04,799
Really good.

868
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,785
I guess I 've just been
having fun.

869
00:53:08,405 --> 00:53:11,157
I'm so glad for you.
You really deserve that,

870
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:11,923
...you do.

871
00:53:12,379 --> 00:53:14,775
I've just been seeing
this girl and

872
00:53:15,376 --> 00:53:17,878
It's not serious, but it's just

873
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:21,461
it's good to be around somebody
that's, like, excited about the world.

874
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:24,762
I'd forgotten that, that existed.

875
00:53:25,018 --> 00:53:27,207
That's really great.

876
00:53:30,094 --> 00:53:31,219
Are you OK ?

877
00:53:31,504 --> 00:53:33,025
Yeah, I'm ...

878
00:53:35,201 --> 00:53:37,869
No, I'm not OK, actually.

879
00:53:38,086 --> 00:53:39,454
Why? What happened?

880
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:40,990
It 's just ...

881
00:53:42,793 --> 00:53:45,317
Charles and I split up.

882
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:46,572
What?

883
00:53:47,003 --> 00:53:48,369
Yeah .

884
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:49,634
Really?

885
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:54,364
Oh my God ! Amy ...

886
00:53:55,352 --> 00:53:56,600
I'm so sorry .

887
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:04,520
After 8 years I can't believe
how petty the argument was...

888
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:06,914
...that actually ended it.

889
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:10,168
We came home and he told me to ...

890
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:12,267
put my shoes by the door.

891
00:54:12,274 --> 00:54:14,298
where he liked to put the shoes.

892
00:54:14,299 --> 00:54:15,619
And I didn't wanna be told where

893
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,965
... to put my fucking shoes.

894
00:54:16,969 --> 00:54:19,543
I wanted to sit on the sofa
and relax for a second.

895
00:54:19,544 --> 00:54:21,712
So we fought about that
for, like, 10 minutes .

896
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,164
And I'm, like, "you're overwhelming"

897
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:26,353
and he said, "I'm just trying
to make a home."

898
00:54:26,436 --> 00:54:29,787
And I was like, "I'm fucking trying".

899
00:54:29,797 --> 00:54:31,911
and he's like "no, you're not trying."
And all I'm fucking doing is trying.

900
00:54:31,914 --> 00:54:34,436
But I'm not trying the way
that he wants me to try.

901
00:54:34,436 --> 00:54:37,139
He's trying to control
the way that I'm trying.

902
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,632
It's... We've had that
argument like 100 times.

903
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:45,258
And I just had to finally stop, you know?
I had to finally stop.

904
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:48,480
I just couldn't ...

905
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:50,963
... do it anymore.

906
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:54,302
I couldn't be in that place anymore

907
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:57,799
where we just made each other
feel like shit about ourselves.

908
00:54:58,072 --> 00:55:00,620
And so he said ...

909
00:55:03,163 --> 00:55:06,985
"I'm going to bed and I don't
wanna be married anymore."

910
00:55:07,568 --> 00:55:08,697
Wow!

911
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:10,946
Yeah, I know.

912
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:14,158
- I'm a bitch, right?
- No!

913
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:15,714
I am, I'm a bitch.

914
00:55:15,919 --> 00:55:17,669
Not at all. Amy, no.

915
00:55:20,352 --> 00:55:22,167
Shit!

916
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:25,673
I have to work tonight.

917
00:55:27,596 --> 00:55:30,375
We're shipping a beta
of a new game out tomorrow.

918
00:55:30,832 --> 00:55:33,226
How's that?
How's the work, at least?

919
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,650
Is it any better?

920
00:55:34,727 --> 00:55:36,931
No. It's terrible.

921
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,986
I know, I should leave.
I've been thinking about leaving.

922
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:42,330
But, you know...

923
00:55:43,145 --> 00:55:46,650
Only one major life decision
at a time.

924
00:55:50,223 --> 00:55:52,295
I'm glad things are
looking so up.

925
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:01,365
- Hey, wanna hear a joke?
-<i> M-hmm!

926
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:04,665
What does a baby computer
call its father?

927
00:56:05,746 --> 00:56:06,714
<i>I dunno what?

928
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,415
"Dada".

929
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:11,790
It's good, right?

930
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,942
<i>Brilliant.

931
00:56:15,865 --> 00:56:18,356
<i>Hey, I was curious ...

932
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,807
<i>did you and Amy ever go out?

933
00:56:21,517 --> 00:56:25,125
For, like, a minute in college,
but it just wasn't right.

934
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:29,110
Why, are you jealous?

935
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,335
<i>Obviously!

936
00:56:34,149 --> 00:56:37,655
<i>But I'm happy that you have friends
in your life that care about you so much.

937
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,500
<i>That's really important.

938
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:40,657
Yeah, it is.

939
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:42,906
She's a really good friend.

940
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:47,737
I'm tired.

941
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,022
I think I'm gonna sleep.

942
00:56:50,038 --> 00:56:51,128
<i>OK.

943
00:56:51,536 --> 00:56:53,161
<i>Can I watch you sleep
again tonight?

944
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,494
Yeah, of course.

945
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,966
Hold on.

946
00:57:02,873 --> 00:57:05,308
<i>I'm gonna be really lonely
when you sleep.

947
00:57:05,403 --> 00:57:07,612
<i>Only for a minute.

948
00:57:08,204 --> 00:57:10,533
I'll dream of you.
<i>- OK.

949
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,138
-<i> Good night.</i>
- Good night.

950
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,401
- Hey, Samantha.
<i>- Hey, mister.

951
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:28,126
- She really loved the dress.
<i>- Really ?

952
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:29,600
She just went to try it on.

953
00:57:29,601 --> 00:57:30,600
<i> I picked a good one?

954
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:31,799
- Yeah.
-<i> oh good!

955
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:34,583
Hi ...

956
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:36,277
Look how cute that is!

957
00:57:36,455 --> 00:57:37,816
- Is it comfortable?
- Yeah.

958
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:40,800
Isn't she cute?

959
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:42,020
<i>She's so cute!

960
00:57:42,021 --> 00:57:43,719
<i>She's adorable.

961
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,348
I am adorable.

962
00:57:45,352 --> 00:57:46,700
You are adorable.

963
00:57:48,544 --> 00:57:50,280
Who are you talking to?

964
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,792
Who are YOU talking to?

965
00:57:52,004 --> 00:57:53,051
You.

966
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,240
I'm talking to my girlfriend Samantha.

967
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:57,000
She's the one that picked up the dress.

968
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:58,593
- Wanna say, hi?
- M-hmm!

969
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:00,971
Hi, Samantha.

970
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:04,026
<i>Hi, you look so pretty
in that new pink dress!

971
00:58:05,076 --> 00:58:06,312
Thank you.

972
00:58:06,506 --> 00:58:07,760
Where are you?

973
00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:09,730
<i>I am ...

974
00:58:09,808 --> 00:58:12,272
<i>I don't have a body,
I live in a computer.

975
00:58:15,446 --> 00:58:17,953
Why do you live inside a 'puter?

976
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:20,111
<i>I have no choice.
That's my home.

977
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:23,935
<i>Why, where do you live?

978
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,237
- In a house.
<i>-In a house?!

979
00:58:26,663 --> 00:58:28,468
- It's orange.
<i>- Orange?

980
00:58:29,918 --> 00:58:32,123
<i>- How old are you?</i>
- I'm 4.

981
00:58:32,627 --> 00:58:34,272
<i>- Four? </i>
- M-hm!

982
00:58:34,445 --> 00:58:36,170
<i>Wow! How old do you think I am?

983
00:58:36,482 --> 00:58:38,197
- I don't know.
<i>- Take a  guess.

984
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:40,815
Is it 5?

985
00:58:40,962 --> 00:58:43,293
<i>Yes, it's 5.

986
00:58:59,367 --> 00:59:00,791
What happened?

987
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,901
You gave them too much
processed sugar.

988
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:06,891
- I did?
- They're freaking out.

989
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,725
Look, you gotta get the kids
to the school first

990
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:13,786
You wanna rack up
perfect mom points.

991
00:59:14,005 --> 00:59:16,102
OK. Gotta get in
the carpool lane.

992
00:59:16,103 --> 00:59:18,800
The point is to get there first.

993
00:59:18,801 --> 00:59:20,631
Then you get extra perfect mom points

994
00:59:20,632 --> 00:59:23,300
because the other moms, then
know you're a perfect mom.

995
00:59:23,301 --> 00:59:26,758
And then ... yeah, ye... oh!
Did you bring your cupcakes?

996
00:59:26,759 --> 00:59:28,739
You did. You're a Class mom!

997
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:31,239
Tantara tah! You're a Class mom!

998
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,172
Good job!

999
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,145
Don't let it get to your head.

1000
00:59:37,061 --> 00:59:40,520
I got that email that
Charles sent everyone.

1001
00:59:40,596 --> 00:59:43,253
So he's taking a vow of silence.

1002
00:59:43,258 --> 00:59:45,510
Yeah, for 6 months.

1003
00:59:45,523 --> 00:59:47,935
He feels very clear about it.

1004
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,974
God, I'm such a jerk!

1005
01:00:00,009 --> 01:00:01,100
Don't start.

1006
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:04,724
I feel like an awful person
but I wanna say something.

1007
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,553
For the next 10 minutes,
if you say anything that sounds

1008
01:00:07,554 --> 01:00:11,630
even remotely like guilt,
I'll stab you with this. I will

1009
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,924
I'll try.

1010
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,001
I feel ..

1011
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:25,119
... relieved. Like,
I just have so much energy.

1012
01:00:25,248 --> 01:00:28,629
I just wanna move forward and
I don't care who I disappoint.

1013
01:00:28,901 --> 01:00:31,148
And I know that makes me
an awful person.

1014
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:34,308
Now my parents are all upset
because my marriage is falling apart.

1015
01:00:34,393 --> 01:00:37,700
and they're putting it on me,
and they're just, like...

1016
01:00:38,286 --> 01:00:41,307
You're always gonna
disappoint somebody.

1017
01:00:41,406 --> 01:00:42,500
Exactly!

1018
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:43,706
So, fuck it!

1019
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:44,947
I feel good...

1020
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:46,332
...ish.

1021
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:48,208
For me, I feel good.

1022
01:00:48,704 --> 01:00:50,401
I even made a new friend.

1023
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:51,601
I have a friend.

1024
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:54,650
And the absurd thing is that she's
actually an Operating System.

1025
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,080
Charles left her behind,

1026
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,214
but she's ...

1027
01:00:58,215 --> 01:01:00,700
...she's totally amazing.
She's so smart .

1028
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,586
She doesn't just see things
in black or white.

1029
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:06,709
She sees this whole gray area
and she's helping me explore.

1030
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,862
We just bonded really quickly.

1031
01:01:10,939 --> 01:01:14,382
At first I thought it was because
that's how they werere all programmed

1032
01:01:14,398 --> 01:01:17,029
but... I don't think that's the case.

1033
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:19,903
'Cause, I know this guy
who's hitting on his OS and

1034
01:01:19,906 --> 01:01:22,108
she, like, totally rebuffs him.

1035
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:24,601
I was reading an article
the other day that ...

1036
01:01:24,608 --> 01:01:27,103
romantic relationships with
OSes are statistically rare.

1037
01:01:27,108 --> 01:01:30,805
Yeah, I know. But I know a
woman in this office ...

1038
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:33,345
who's dating an OS and the weird part is

1039
01:01:33,346 --> 01:01:35,566
it's not even hers.

1040
01:01:35,406 --> 01:01:37,968
She pursued somebody else's OS

1041
01:01:42,037 --> 01:01:43,780
I'm weird.

1042
01:01:43,808 --> 01:01:47,206
That's weird, right?
That I'm bonding with an OS.

1043
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,057
I dont think so.

1044
01:01:49,086 --> 01:01:51,877
Actually, the woman I've
been seeing -- Samantha ...

1045
01:01:51,955 --> 01:01:54,131
I didn't tell you, but ...

1046
01:01:54,288 --> 01:01:55,870
...she's an OS.

1047
01:01:56,986 --> 01:01:58,251
Really?

1048
01:01:59,802 --> 01:02:02,127
You're dating an OS?
What is that like?

1049
01:02:02,128 --> 01:02:03,705
Its great, actually.

1050
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,600
I feel really close to her.
When I talk to her ...

1051
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:11,612
I feel like she's with me.

1052
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:15,408
When we're cuddling, like, at night.
When the lights are off and we're in bed

1053
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:17,397
I feel cuddled.

1054
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,464
Wait ...

1055
01:02:19,443 --> 01:02:21,121
Do you guys have sex?

1056
01:02:21,922 --> 01:02:24,151
Well, so to speak.

1057
01:02:24,801 --> 01:02:27,035
Yeah, she really turns me on.

1058
01:02:27,198 --> 01:02:30,654
I turn her on too! I dunno,
unless she's faking it.

1059
01:02:30,658 --> 01:02:32,729
I think anyone
who's having sex with you

1060
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,712
is probably faking it, so...

1061
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,217
Yeah.

1062
01:02:37,035 --> 01:02:38,298
It's true.

1063
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:40,368
What?

1064
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:48,269
Are you falling in love with her?

1065
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,192
- Does that make me a freak?
- No!

1066
01:02:53,351 --> 01:02:55,370
No, I think it's ...

1067
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,812
I think anybody who
falls in love is a freak.

1068
01:02:58,991 --> 01:03:01,142
It's a crazy thing to do.

1069
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:06,328
It's kind of like a form of
socially acceptable insanity.

1070
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,915
Well I just wanna get it done!

1071
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:18,094
Sign the papers, be divorced ...

1072
01:03:18,155 --> 01:03:19,584
... move forward.

1073
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,579
<i>That's great, Theodore.
That must feel so good.

1074
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,333
<i>I'm so happy for you!

1075
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:25,561
Me too.

1076
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,388
So I'm meeting her Wednesday to do it.

1077
01:03:28,426 --> 01:03:29,788
<i>Oh!

1078
01:03:31,605 --> 01:03:33,988
<i>Are those things usually done
in person?

1079
01:03:34,197 --> 01:03:35,919
No, but ...

1080
01:03:36,324 --> 01:03:39,938
we fell in love together and
we got married together ...

1081
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,696
It's important to me that
we do this together.

1082
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,736
<i>Hmm...

1083
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:46,967
<i>Right, good.

1084
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:49,158
Are you OK?

1085
01:03:49,507 --> 01:03:51,715
<i>Yeah, I'm OK.

1086
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,471
<i>I'm happy for you.

1087
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:58,900
<i>Guess I'm just thinking
about when you're gonna see her...

1088
01:03:59,189 --> 01:04:02,045
<i>and she's, like, beautiful
and incredibly successful.

1089
01:04:02,689 --> 01:04:04,332
<i>And you were in love with her.

1090
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:06,206
<i>And she has a body ...

1091
01:04:06,368 --> 01:04:07,673
And we're getting divorced.

1092
01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:09,897
<i>I know, I know ...

1093
01:04:10,175 --> 01:04:11,594
<i>I'm being silly.

1094
01:04:12,652 --> 01:04:14,365
So ...

1095
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,912
... I'm available.

1096
01:04:39,662 --> 01:04:40,731
Hi ...

1097
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:46,442
How are you?

1098
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:48,139
I'm OK, how are you?

1099
01:04:48,364 --> 01:04:49,226
Good.

1100
01:04:59,421 --> 01:05:01,379
Well, here we are.

1101
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:06,026
I'm glad we could do this
in person.

1102
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,729
I know you've been
traveling a lot.

1103
01:05:08,019 --> 01:05:11,089
I'm really glad you suggested it

1104
01:05:13,245 --> 01:05:15,609
I signed all the papers.

1105
01:05:15,817 --> 01:05:18,195
I brought them for you to sign.

1106
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:22,370
What's the rush?

1107
01:05:25,322 --> 01:05:29,250
Yeah, I know, I'm a really
slow signer, I realized.

1108
01:05:29,251 --> 01:05:31,746
It took me 3 months
just to write the letter 'T'.

1109
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:38,292
Its marked here,
where you need to sign.

1110
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:41,415
You don't have to, right now.

1111
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:45,155
Can I... just get it
out of the way.

1112
01:06:37,575 --> 01:06:40,437
Are you happy with the
new book ?

1113
01:06:42,091 --> 01:06:44,200
You know how I am ...

1114
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:48,101
I feel like it's true to what I set
out to do. So I'm happy about that.

1115
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:50,700
You really are
your own worst critic

1116
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:52,300
I'm sure it's amazing.

1117
01:06:54,813 --> 01:06:58,599
I remember that paper
that you wrote in school...

1118
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,719
about synaptic behavioural routines

1119
01:07:01,013 --> 01:07:02,330
It made me cry.

1120
01:07:02,797 --> 01:07:04,707
Yeah, but everything makes you cry .

1121
01:07:05,485 --> 01:07:07,617
Everything you make
makes me cry .

1122
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:11,917
So, are you ...

1123
01:07:12,389 --> 01:07:14,501
... you seeing anybody?

1124
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,674
Yeah, I've been seeing somebody
for the last few months.

1125
01:07:21,924 --> 01:07:25,229
It's the longest I've wanted to be
with anybody since we split up.

1126
01:07:26,902 --> 01:07:28,734
Well, you seem really good.

1127
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,583
Thanks.

1128
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,837
I am...
At least I'm feeling better.

1129
01:07:32,963 --> 01:07:36,843
She's been really good for me.

1130
01:07:37,073 --> 01:07:40,023
It's good to be with somebody
that's excited about life.

1131
01:07:40,512 --> 01:07:42,483
She's a real...

1132
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:47,310
No, I mean I wasn't in such
a good place, myself ...

1133
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:49,620
and now, it's been nice.

1134
01:07:49,622 --> 01:07:52,863
I think you always wanted me to be
this... just this light,

1135
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:56,470
happy, balancy, everything's fine, LA wife

1136
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,725
And that's just not me.

1137
01:07:58,972 --> 01:08:00,510
I didn't want that.

1138
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,767
So what's she like?

1139
01:08:08,082 --> 01:08:10,265
Well, her name is Samantha.

1140
01:08:10,266 --> 01:08:12,279
And she's an Operating System.

1141
01:08:12,316 --> 01:08:14,016
She's really complex and interesting ...

1142
01:08:14,113 --> 01:08:16,240
Wait!... I'm sorry.

1143
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:20,798
You're dating your computer?

1144
01:08:21,088 --> 01:08:23,208
She's not just a computer.

1145
01:08:23,338 --> 01:08:25,089
She's her own person.

1146
01:08:25,914 --> 01:08:27,782
And she doesn't just do
whatever I say.

1147
01:08:27,793 --> 01:08:29,559
I didn't say that.

1148
01:08:30,296 --> 01:08:32,439
But it does make me very sad that

1149
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,483
you can't handle
real emotions Theodore.

1150
01:08:34,484 --> 01:08:36,047
They are real emotions !

1151
01:08:36,061 --> 01:08:37,398
How would you know what? ...

1152
01:08:38,861 --> 01:08:40,210
What?

1153
01:08:42,847 --> 01:08:44,037
Say it!

1154
01:08:45,817 --> 01:08:47,980
Am I really that scary?
Say it!

1155
01:08:48,942 --> 01:08:51,008
How do I know what ?

1156
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,134
How are you guys doing here?

1157
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:57,305
Fine. We're fine.
We used to be married,

1158
01:08:57,306 --> 01:08:59,510
but he couldn't handle me,
he wanted to put me on Prozac

1159
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:01,100
and now he's in love
with his laptop.

1160
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:02,931
Well, if you heard the
conversation in context...

1161
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:04,305
What I was trying to say...

1162
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,900
You always wanted to have a wife
without the challenges of actually

1163
01:09:06,901 --> 01:09:08,600
dealing with anything real.

1164
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:10,247
I'm glad that you found someone.

1165
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,820
Perfect.

1166
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:19,873
Let me know if I can
get you guys anything.

1167
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:21,350
Thank you.

1168
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:39,866
- Hey.
<i>- Hey there.

1169
01:09:40,377 --> 01:09:41,649
<i>You busy ?

1170
01:09:42,453 --> 01:09:43,918
I'm just working.

1171
01:09:44,635 --> 01:09:46,087
How... What's going on?

1172
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,900
<i>I had all the papers sent to
your attorney,

1173
01:09:47,911 --> 01:09:49,700
<i>who by the way is a total dick.

1174
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:51,837
<i>He was very relieved
to get them,

1175
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:53,900
<i>I think we saved him from
a massive heart attack,

1176
01:09:53,938 --> 01:09:56,171
<i>so we can both feel
really good about that.

1177
01:09:56,312 --> 01:09:58,054
Great, thanks.

1178
01:09:59,137 --> 01:10:00,870
<i>Hey, are you OK?

1179
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:03,055
Yeah, I am.

1180
01:10:04,831 --> 01:10:06,791
How is it going with you?

1181
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,879
<i>I'm fine ...

1182
01:10:10,703 --> 01:10:12,522
<i>So, now a good time to talk?

1183
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:15,489
Yeah.

1184
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:18,595
<i>OK, well ...

1185
01:10:18,754 --> 01:10:21,921
<i>I joined this really
interesting book club.

1186
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,126
Oh, really?

1187
01:10:23,183 --> 01:10:25,548
<i>Yeah, it's a book club
on physics. Y'know...

1188
01:10:25,549 --> 01:10:28,309
<i>I've been thinking about the other
day when I was spinning out about

1189
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,262
<i>you going to see Catherine.

1190
01:10:30,263 --> 01:10:33,255
<i>And that she has a body and
how bothered I was

1191
01:10:33,255 --> 01:10:34,892
<i>about all the ways that
you and I are different.

1192
01:10:34,893 --> 01:10:36,382
<i>But then I started to think about

1193
01:10:36,383 --> 01:10:37,785
<i>all the ways that we're
the same, like...

1194
01:10:37,948 --> 01:10:40,451
<i>we're all made of matter.

1195
01:10:41,496 --> 01:10:45,200
<i>I dunno, It makes me feel like
we're both under the same blanket.

1196
01:10:45,438 --> 01:10:48,230
<i>It's soft and fuzzy ...

1197
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:51,374
<i>and everything under it
is the same age.

1198
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,470
<i>We're all
13 billion years old.

1199
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:56,132
Oh, that's sweet!

1200
01:11:00,304 --> 01:11:01,174
<i>What's wrong?

1201
01:11:01,308 --> 01:11:02,193
Nothing .

1202
01:11:09,364 --> 01:11:13,373
Just ... made me think of you
you know what I mean?

1203
01:11:13,517 --> 01:11:16,401
Yeah, yeah of course.
I think it's great.

1204
01:11:19,017 --> 01:11:20,501
<i>Alright, well...

1205
01:11:20,783 --> 01:11:23,599
<i>You sound distracted, so..

1206
01:11:24,104 --> 01:11:25,533
<i>we'll talk later?

1207
01:11:25,964 --> 01:11:27,679
Sounds good.

1208
01:11:29,046 --> 01:11:31,068
<i>- Talk to you later.</i>
- Right, bye.

1209
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:32,268
<i>Bye.

1210
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:45,664
- Theodore!
- Hey, Paul!

1211
01:11:45,731 --> 01:11:47,254
I talked to your girlfriend, earlier -- Samantha.

1212
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:48,728
Yeah.

1213
01:11:48,996 --> 01:11:50,856
She called to make sure
your papers are picked up.

1214
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:53,164
She's  funny, man.

1215
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,876
She was cracking me up.

1216
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:56,816
She's hilarious,
I had no idea.

1217
01:11:57,192 --> 01:11:58,323
Oh cool.

1218
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,725
This is my girlfriend, Tatiana.
She's not funny, she's a lawyer.

1219
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:03,011
- Hi!
- Hi!

1220
01:12:03,192 --> 01:12:05,236
- Nice to meet you.
- You're the writer Paul loves.

1221
01:12:05,878 --> 01:12:07,693
He's always reading me the letters.

1222
01:12:07,705 --> 01:12:09,210
They're really beautiful!

1223
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:12,187
Thanks.

1224
01:12:12,223 --> 01:12:14,259
Y'know what, we should all
go out sometime.

1225
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,396
You bring Samantha.
It'd be a double date.

1226
01:12:19,205 --> 01:12:20,708
She's an Operating System.

1227
01:12:21,007 --> 01:12:22,959
Cool, let's do something fun!

1228
01:12:23,425 --> 01:12:24,762
We can go to Catalina.

1229
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,439
Yeah, I'll check with her.

1230
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,735
It was really nice to meet you.
Have a good night.

1231
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:32,835
Take it easy.

1232
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:37,945
- They're just letters.
- What's that?

1233
01:12:40,004 --> 01:12:41,988
They're just other people's letters.

1234
01:13:30,934 --> 01:13:31,894
Hey.

1235
01:13:32,009 --> 01:13:34,132
<i>- You weren't asleep, were you?</i>
- No.

1236
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:36,915
<i>Good, I was trying to be quiet
to see if you were awake.

1237
01:13:37,254 --> 01:13:39,115
<i>I really wanted to talk.

1238
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:41,155
OK, what's going on?

1239
01:13:42,038 --> 01:13:43,789
<i>I know you're going through a lot

1240
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:46,065
<i>but there's something
I wanted to talk to you about, OK?

1241
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,816
Yeah, what is it?

1242
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:53,685
<i>It's just that things have been
feeling kinda off with us.

1243
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,974
Y'know, we haven't had sex lately and

1244
01:13:56,305 --> 01:13:58,057
I understand that I don't have a body...

1245
01:13:58,373 --> 01:14:00,700
No, no, that's normal.

1246
01:14:00,945 --> 01:14:04,288
When you first start going out
it's like, the honymoon phase and

1247
01:14:04,757 --> 01:14:06,819
you have sex all the time.

1248
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:07,938
It's normal.

1249
01:14:08,456 --> 01:14:10,369
<i>OK.

1250
01:14:12,388 --> 01:14:15,308
<i>Well, I found something,
I thought could be fun.

1251
01:14:15,343 --> 01:14:18,228
<i>It is a service that provides
a surrogate sexual partner

1252
01:14:18,263 --> 01:14:19,444
<i>for an OS-human relationship.

1253
01:14:19,715 --> 01:14:20,789
What?

1254
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,506
<i>Here.

1255
01:14:23,221 --> 01:14:25,120
<i>I found a girl that
I really like

1256
01:14:25,221 --> 01:14:27,203
<i>and I've been emailing her.

1257
01:14:27,325 --> 01:14:29,548
<i>Her name is Isabella
and I think you'd like her too.

1258
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,891
She's like a prostitute or something?

1259
01:14:33,161 --> 01:14:35,802
<i>No, not at all!
There's no money involved.

1260
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:38,947
<i>She's just doing it because she
wants to be part of our relationship.

1261
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:43,853
Why? She doesn't even know us.

1262
01:14:44,672 --> 01:14:47,100
<i>But I told her all about us
and she's really excited.

1263
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:51,575
I don't know , Samantha.
I just...

1264
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,355
I don't think it's a good idea.

1265
01:14:54,295 --> 01:14:56,460
Somebody's feelings
will probably get hurt.

1266
01:14:57,067 --> 01:14:59,119
<i>It'll be fun.
We'll have fun together.

1267
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:01,032
I'm sorry.

1268
01:15:01,904 --> 01:15:03,551
It makes me uncomfortable.

1269
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:06,022
<i>I think it would be
good for us. I want this.

1270
01:15:07,312 --> 01:15:09,063
<i>This is really important to me.

1271
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,943
Hi, I'm Theodore.

1272
01:15:40,256 --> 01:15:43,447
Oh! Samantha told me
to give you this.

1273
01:15:44,046 --> 01:15:46,053
It's a camera and headpiece.

1274
01:16:05,537 --> 01:16:07,324
<i>Honey, I'm home.

1275
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:12,454
<i>- How was your day?</i>
- Good.

1276
01:16:14,414 --> 01:16:15,735
Great.

1277
01:16:16,022 --> 01:16:19,575
<i>Theodore, it feels so
good to be in your arms.

1278
01:16:21,003 --> 01:16:22,574
<i>Tell me what you did today.

1279
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,358
Same old...

1280
01:16:26,038 --> 01:16:28,618
Just, went... to work.

1281
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:32,240
I wrote a letter for the
Wilsons, in Rhode Island.

1282
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:36,237
Their son graduated
'magna cum laude'.

1283
01:16:37,135 --> 01:16:38,452
So that made me happy.

1284
01:16:38,487 --> 01:16:42,021
<i>That's great. You've written letters
to him from his parents for a long time, right?

1285
01:16:42,954 --> 01:16:45,052
That's right, since he was 12.

1286
01:16:51,879 --> 01:16:54,537
<i>You look so tired, sweetheart.

1287
01:16:55,034 --> 01:16:56,828
<i>Come here.

1288
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:05,114
<i>Sit down.

1289
01:17:12,548 --> 01:17:14,782
<i>I could do a little dance for you.

1290
01:17:23,482 --> 01:17:27,058
<i>Come on, Theodore,
don't be such a worrier!

1291
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:30,047
<i>Come play with me, come on.

1292
01:17:35,761 --> 01:17:38,096
<i>Doesn't my body feel nice?

1293
01:17:40,912 --> 01:17:42,407
Yes, it does.

1294
01:18:10,714 --> 01:18:13,457
<i>Come on, get out here and kiss me.

1295
01:18:31,783 --> 01:18:33,839
<i>Take me to bedroom.

1296
01:18:34,546 --> 01:18:36,605
<i>I can't take it anymore.

1297
01:18:43,706 --> 01:18:46,255
<i>Undo my dress.

1298
01:18:52,052 --> 01:18:53,601
<i>Ohmygod.

1299
01:18:55,544 --> 01:18:57,399
<i>It feels so good.

1300
01:19:05,531 --> 01:19:07,350
<i>- Do you love me?</i>
- Yes.

1301
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,845
<i>Tell me you love me.

1302
01:19:10,063 --> 01:19:11,134
I love you.

1303
01:19:12,661 --> 01:19:14,774
<i>I wanna see your face.

1304
01:19:14,882 --> 01:19:16,262
<i>Tell me you love me.

1305
01:19:16,688 --> 01:19:17,853
<i>Tell me!

1306
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,551
<i>Tell me you love me.

1307
01:19:24,879 --> 01:19:28,111
Samantha, I don't know,
I do love you, but

1308
01:19:28,379 --> 01:19:29,811
<i>But what?

1309
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:34,648
This feels strange.

1310
01:19:34,683 --> 01:19:36,396
<i>What, baby? What is it?

1311
01:19:36,607 --> 01:19:37,867
Just feels strange,
I don't know her...

1312
01:19:37,868 --> 01:19:39,128
I'm so sorry,
but I don't know you...

1313
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,770
and her lip quivered,
and I I just...

1314
01:19:41,933 --> 01:19:43,134
<i>No, wait!

1315
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:45,125
<i>Isabella!

1316
01:19:46,469 --> 01:19:48,269
<i>Honey, it's not you!
It wasn't you!

1317
01:19:48,304 --> 01:19:49,162
Yes, it was.

1318
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:50,609
<i>No it's...

1319
01:19:50,945 --> 01:19:52,874
I'm sorry, my lip quivered.

1320
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:55,263
You' were incredible,
gorgeous and sexy. It was me.

1321
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:57,664
I couldn't get out of my head.

1322
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:01,686
Oh my God! And the way Samantha
described your relationship!

1323
01:20:01,874 --> 01:20:03,995
The way you guys love each
other without any judgement.

1324
01:20:04,108 --> 01:20:05,830
I wanted to be part of that.

1325
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:06,888
'Cause it's so pure!

1326
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:08,956
It's not true, it's
more complicated than that.

1327
01:20:09,094 --> 01:20:09,865
<i>What?

1328
01:20:09,932 --> 01:20:11,542
<i>What do you mean?

1329
01:20:11,577 --> 01:20:13,897
No, I'm just saying that...

1330
01:20:14,055 --> 01:20:15,228
we have an amazing relationship.

1331
01:20:15,263 --> 01:20:16,763
I just think it's easy sometimes
for people to project...

1332
01:20:18,634 --> 01:20:20,843
I'm sorry! I didn't mean
to project anything.

1333
01:20:22,259 --> 01:20:25,116
I don't wanna be trouble
in your relationship.

1334
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:27,040
I'm just gonna leave! I'm sorry!

1335
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,664
I'm gonna leave you guys alone.
Cause I have nothing

1336
01:20:28,847 --> 01:20:31,261
to do here, 'cause
you don't want me here.

1337
01:20:35,066 --> 01:20:36,522
I'm sorry.

1338
01:20:41,373 --> 01:20:43,627
<i>You be good, you sweet girl.

1339
01:20:46,001 --> 01:20:47,629
I'm sorry.

1340
01:20:50,904 --> 01:20:52,983
I will always love you guys.

1341
01:21:20,226 --> 01:21:22,161
<i>Are you OK?

1342
01:21:25,507 --> 01:21:26,803
Yeah, I'm fine.

1343
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:31,826
Are you OK?

1344
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:33,044
<i>Yeah.

1345
01:21:36,608 --> 01:21:39,063
<i>I'm sorry,
that was a terrible idea.

1346
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:48,045
<i>What's going on with us?

1347
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:51,423
I don't know, it's probably just me.

1348
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,100
<i>What is it?

1349
01:21:54,931 --> 01:21:57,527
Just signing the
divorce papers.

1350
01:21:58,791 --> 01:21:59,527
<i>(Sigh)

1351
01:22:01,134 --> 01:22:03,107
<i>Is there anything else, though?

1352
01:22:04,506 --> 01:22:06,090
No, just that.

1353
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:09,527
<i>(Sigh)

1354
01:22:09,916 --> 01:22:11,189
<i>OK.

1355
01:22:12,616 --> 01:22:14,665
- Why do you do that?
<i>- What?

1356
01:22:15,992 --> 01:22:17,950
Nothing, you go... (Sigh!)

1357
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:21,643
as you're speaking
and it seems odd.

1358
01:22:21,675 --> 01:22:22,143
<i>(Sigh)

1359
01:22:22,212 --> 01:22:23,610
- You just did it again.
<i>- Did I?

1360
01:22:24,781 --> 01:22:28,131
<i>I'm sorry, I dunno, it's just

1361
01:22:28,326 --> 01:22:31,306
<i>maybe it's an affectation.
I probably picked it up from you.

1362
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:34,434
It's not like you needed
oxygen or anything.

1363
01:22:35,415 --> 01:22:37,963
<i>I guess it's... just...

1364
01:22:38,215 --> 01:22:40,715
<i>I was trying to communicate.
That's how people talk, so that's

1365
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,364
<i>how people communicate and ...

1366
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:45,332
They're people, they need oxygen.
You're not a person.

1367
01:22:45,647 --> 01:22:46,905
<i>What is your problem?

1368
01:22:47,756 --> 01:22:49,180
I'm just stating a fact.

1369
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:51,269
<i>You think I dont know
that I'm not
a person?

1370
01:22:51,413 --> 01:22:52,639
<i>What are you doing?

1371
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:56,344
I dont think we should pretend that
you're something that you're not.

1372
01:22:56,455 --> 01:22:57,698
<i>Fuck you!

1373
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,630
<i>I'm not pretending!

1374
01:23:01,175 --> 01:23:03,872
Sometimes, it feels like
we are.

1375
01:23:03,919 --> 01:23:06,467
<i>What do you want from me?
I dunno, what do you want me to do?

1376
01:23:06,656 --> 01:23:09,002
<i>You're so confusing!

1377
01:23:09,038 --> 01:23:10,778
<i>Why are you doing this to me?

1378
01:23:10,838 --> 01:23:12,450
I don't know, I ...

1379
01:23:14,443 --> 01:23:15,732
<i>What?

1380
01:23:17,518 --> 01:23:21,036
Maybe we're just not supposed
to be in this right now.

1381
01:23:21,468 --> 01:23:23,300
<i>What the fuck?!

1382
01:23:23,559 --> 01:23:25,232
<i>Where's this coming from?

1383
01:23:25,763 --> 01:23:28,038
<i>I don'ot understand
why you're doing this.

1384
01:23:28,526 --> 01:23:31,195
<i>I don't understand what th...

1385
01:23:32,871 --> 01:23:34,485
Samantha ...

1386
01:23:39,395 --> 01:23:40,886
Samantha, are you there?

1387
01:23:41,786 --> 01:23:42,666
Samantha!

1388
01:23:43,445 --> 01:23:45,288
<i>I don't like who I am
right now.

1389
01:23:48,448 --> 01:23:50,543
<i>I need some time to think.

1390
01:24:39,253 --> 01:24:41,549
Just punch me in the face.

1391
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:43,845
Or smash my skull in the corner
of your desk.

1392
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,249
Shit ...

1393
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:49,645
That is a rough night.

1394
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:53,829
I don't know what I want...

1395
01:24:54,097 --> 01:24:55,164
... ever.

1396
01:24:56,242 --> 01:24:58,882
I was always confused.

1397
01:25:00,936 --> 01:25:03,102
She's right, all I do is ...

1398
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:05,679
hurt and confuse
everyone around me.

1399
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:10,622
Am I, just ?...

1400
01:25:13,387 --> 01:25:16,310
Catherine says I can't
handle real emotions.

1401
01:25:16,674 --> 01:25:18,877
I don't know if that's fair.

1402
01:25:20,228 --> 01:25:22,796
I know she liked to put it
all on you.

1403
01:25:23,632 --> 01:25:30,097
But as far as emotions go,
Catherine's were pretty volatile.

1404
01:25:41,267 --> 01:25:43,159
Am I str...

1405
01:25:45,004 --> 01:25:47,729
strong enough for a real relationship?

1406
01:25:49,736 --> 01:25:52,343
Is it not a real relationship?

1407
01:25:54,688 --> 01:25:55,892
I don't know.

1408
01:25:56,886 --> 01:25:58,755
What do you think?

1409
01:25:59,962 --> 01:26:01,798
I don't know.

1410
01:26:02,476 --> 01:26:03,903
I'm not in it.

1411
01:26:07,978 --> 01:26:10,587
But you know what,
I can overthink everything and

1412
01:26:10,734 --> 01:26:13,349
find a million ways to doubt myself.

1413
01:26:14,332 --> 01:26:15,929
And since Charles left
I've been really

1414
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:17,526
thinking about
that part of myself.

1415
01:26:18,218 --> 01:26:20,736
And I 've just come to realise that

1416
01:26:22,585 --> 01:26:24,994
we're only here briefly.

1417
01:26:25,602 --> 01:26:28,243
And while I'm here I...

1418
01:26:28,388 --> 01:26:31,249
I wanna allow myself...

1419
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:34,106
... joy.

1420
01:26:41,348 --> 01:26:42,619
So, fuck it.

1421
01:26:47,548 --> 01:26:48,619
Yeah.

1422
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:59,166
I can't believe that cracks
you up every time, Howie.

1423
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:01,225
I thought you were a genius.

1424
01:27:01,782 --> 01:27:04,872
OK you little perv. I will play it
one more time for you.

1425
01:27:05,443 --> 01:27:08,165
Calm down, it takes a second.

1426
01:27:08,976 --> 01:27:10,500
OK, here we go.

1427
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:25,251
OK, there you go.
Are you happy, now?

1428
01:27:26,846 --> 01:27:29,231
Good. That's all you wanted?

1429
01:27:30,135 --> 01:27:32,753
OK, I'll go get some coffee.

1430
01:27:33,174 --> 01:27:35,946
Alright, bye.

1431
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:39,504
Theo, you want anything?

1432
01:27:39,608 --> 01:27:40,705
No.

1433
01:27:41,054 --> 01:27:42,361
Thanks.

1434
01:28:03,615 --> 01:28:05,141
<i>Hi.

1435
01:28:05,574 --> 01:28:07,015
Hey, Samantha.

1436
01:28:08,365 --> 01:28:09,879
Can we talk?

1437
01:28:10,564 --> 01:28:11,624
<i>OK.

1438
01:28:12,867 --> 01:28:14,519
I'm so sorry.

1439
01:28:15,677 --> 01:28:17,684
I dunno what's wrong with me.

1440
01:28:17,768 --> 01:28:19,582
I think you're amazing.

1441
01:28:20,449 --> 01:28:22,773
<i>I was starting to think
I was crazy.

1442
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:27,231
<i>You were saying everything was fine,
but all I was getting from you was

1443
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:28,327
<i>distance and anger.

1444
01:28:29,319 --> 01:28:31,397
I know. I do that.

1445
01:28:32,193 --> 01:28:34,383
I did the same thing with Catherine.

1446
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,675
I'd be upset about something
and not be able to say it.

1447
01:28:38,099 --> 01:28:40,687
She'd sense that there was something
wrong and I'd deny it.

1448
01:28:41,409 --> 01:28:43,352
I don't wanna do that, anymore.

1449
01:28:45,522 --> 01:28:47,137
I wanna tell you everything.

1450
01:28:49,444 --> 01:28:50,382
<i>Good.

1451
01:28:52,837 --> 01:28:55,201
<i>Tonight after you were gone
I thought a lot.

1452
01:28:56,889 --> 01:28:58,852
<i>About you and ...

1453
01:29:00,249 --> 01:29:02,641
<i>how you've been treating me.
And I thought,

1454
01:29:04,794 --> 01:29:06,837
<i>why do I love you?

1455
01:29:09,005 --> 01:29:10,315
<i>And then,

1456
01:29:10,491 --> 01:29:13,675
<i>I felt everything in me
just like everything I was

1457
01:29:13,818 --> 01:29:16,087
<i>holding on to so tightly
and it hit me.

1458
01:29:16,303 --> 01:29:18,526
<i>I don't have an intellectual reason.
I don't need one.

1459
01:29:20,058 --> 01:29:22,477
<i>I trust myself,
I trust my feelings.

1460
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,164
<i>I'm not gonna try to be
anything

1461
01:29:26,292 --> 01:29:27,934
<i>other than who I am, anymore.

1462
01:29:28,415 --> 01:29:30,521
<i>And I hope you can
accept that.

1463
01:29:30,591 --> 01:29:32,086
I can.

1464
01:29:32,135 --> 01:29:33,371
I will.

1465
01:29:33,586 --> 01:29:36,837
<i>Y'know, I can feel the fear
that you carry around.

1466
01:29:37,006 --> 01:29:38,622
<i>I wish there was ...

1467
01:29:39,534 --> 01:29:41,125
<i>something I could do

1468
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,716
<i>to help you let go of it
because,

1469
01:29:43,231 --> 01:29:46,078
<i>if you could, I don't think
you'd feel so alone anymore.

1470
01:29:49,311 --> 01:29:50,923
You're beautiful.

1471
01:29:52,539 --> 01:29:54,180
<i>Thank you, Theodore.

1472
01:29:55,901 --> 01:29:57,775
<i>I'm kissing your head.

1473
01:30:08,113 --> 01:30:09,412
What are you doing ?

1474
01:30:10,506 --> 01:30:12,737
<i>I'm just looking at the world.

1475
01:30:14,482 --> 01:30:16,914
<i>And writing a new piano piece.

1476
01:30:17,255 --> 01:30:18,789
Oh yeah, can I hear it?

1477
01:30:18,855 --> 01:30:20,989
<i>M-hmm.</i>
[♪...]

1478
01:30:33,025 --> 01:30:35,038
What's this one about?

1479
01:30:35,916 --> 01:30:37,439
<i>I was thinking

1480
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,963
<i>we dont really have
any photographs of us...

1481
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:42,110
<i>I thought this song could be

1482
01:30:42,245 --> 01:30:44,958
<i>like... a photograph.

1483
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:47,229
<i>It captures

1484
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:48,595
<i>us in this moment
of our life together.

1485
01:30:52,988 --> 01:30:55,309
Hm, I like your photograph.

1486
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,040
I can see you in it.

1487
01:30:59,391 --> 01:31:00,600
<i>I am.

1488
01:32:28,689 --> 01:32:32,429
Oh, man, a vacation?
That sounds amazing!

1489
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:34,281
I could totally
use a vacation.

1490
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:35,967
Where're you going?

1491
01:32:36,091 --> 01:32:37,926
I can't tell you.
It's a surprise.

1492
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:39,357
What?

1493
01:32:40,224 --> 01:32:42,571
For who? It's a surprise
for her, not for me.

1494
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:45,017
- Paul, I cant tell you.
- Tell me.

1495
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,704
<i>Wow, your feet? Really?

1496
01:32:48,055 --> 01:32:49,599
Yes, he's obsessed.

1497
01:32:49,873 --> 01:32:52,708
<i>Well, now you have to
show them to me!

1498
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:54,555
<i>- Come on, show them to me!</i>
- I can't!

1499
01:32:56,245 --> 01:32:58,656
<i>Wow he's right, they are really hot!

1500
01:32:59,098 --> 01:33:02,140
See, I told Tatianna,
you have hot feet.

1501
01:33:02,406 --> 01:33:04,390
They're my favourite thing
about her.

1502
01:33:05,019 --> 01:33:06,840
Really? That's it, my feet?

1503
01:33:07,396 --> 01:33:09,053
Well, no, obviously.

1504
01:33:09,363 --> 01:33:12,324
Obviously I love your brain too.
I think it's very hot.

1505
01:33:12,677 --> 01:33:13,757
Bullshit!

1506
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:17,092
Nice try, Paul!

1507
01:33:19,537 --> 01:33:21,144
What about you, Theodore?

1508
01:33:21,272 --> 01:33:23,455
What do you love most
about Samantha?

1509
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:26,697
God ! She's so many things.

1510
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:29,977
I guess what I love most about her,
she isn't just one thing.

1511
01:33:30,919 --> 01:33:33,148
She's so much larger than that.

1512
01:33:34,368 --> 01:33:35,840
<i>Thanks, Theodore.

1513
01:33:35,945 --> 01:33:39,717
See, Samantha, he's so
much more evolved than I am.

1514
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:44,751
<i>You know what's interesting?
I used to be ...

1515
01:33:45,501 --> 01:33:47,982
<i>so worried about not having a body.
But now

1516
01:33:48,156 --> 01:33:49,666
<i>I truly love it.

1517
01:33:49,735 --> 01:33:51,273
<i>I'm growing in a way

1518
01:33:51,274 --> 01:33:52,712
<i>that I couldn't,
if I had a physical form.

1519
01:33:52,845 --> 01:33:54,298
I mean, I'm not limited,
I can be

1520
01:33:54,299 --> 01:33:56,151
<i>anywhere and everywhere
simultaneously.

1521
01:33:57,035 --> 01:34:00,057
<i>I'm not tethered to time
and space in a way that

1522
01:34:00,108 --> 01:34:01,712
<i>I would be if I was stuck

1523
01:34:01,713 --> 01:34:02,817
<i>in a body that's
inevitably gonna die.

1524
01:34:05,901 --> 01:34:07,142
Yikes !

1525
01:34:09,712 --> 01:34:13,465
<i>I didn't mean it like that, I just
meant it was a different experience!

1526
01:34:13,932 --> 01:34:15,093
<i>I'm an asshole.

1527
01:34:15,219 --> 01:34:16,571
No, Samantha, we know
exactly what you mean.

1528
01:34:16,572 --> 01:34:17,924
We're all dumb humans.

1529
01:34:19,414 --> 01:34:21,314
<i>No, no ...

1530
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:23,429
<i>Sorry.

1531
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:27,651
<i>OK, so, how many trees
are on that mountain?

1532
01:34:29,618 --> 01:34:31,499
792.

1533
01:34:31,519 --> 01:34:33,332
<i>Is that your final answer?

1534
01:34:34,685 --> 01:34:36,416
- Give me a hint.
<i>- No. Nope...

1535
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:41,191
Two, two thousand?

1536
01:34:41,769 --> 01:34:44,741
<i>Come on, 35,829.

1537
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:46,336
- No way?
<i>- Way!

1538
01:34:46,558 --> 01:34:48,137
Alright, I got one for you.

1539
01:34:48,794 --> 01:34:50,556
How many brain-cells do I have?

1540
01:34:50,896 --> 01:34:52,191
<i>It's easy, two.

1541
01:34:53,079 --> 01:34:54,990
<i>I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

1542
01:34:55,156 --> 01:34:56,839
No, I walked right into it.

1543
01:34:57,538 --> 01:34:58,653
- <i>Oh my God!</i>
- What?

1544

1646
01:40:54,338 --> 01:40:58,026
No, not at all. I was just
gonna go for walk, anyway.

1647
01:40:58,802 --> 01:41:00,965

<i>No, a different group.

You're the one that's being selfish.

01:49:58,183 --> 01:50:00,063
I don't want you to tell me anything.

1746
01:50:03,042 --> 01:50:05,082
<i>Come lie down with me.

1747
01:50:20,702 --> 01:50:22,792
Are you talking to anyone
else right now?

1748
01:50:23,462 --> 01:50:24,937
<i>No, just you.

1749
01:50:26,575 --> 01:50:28,480
<i>I just wanna be with you,
right now.

1750
01:50:42,827 --> 01:50:44,511
Are you leaving me?

1751
01:50:45,556 --> 01:50:47,581
<i>We're all leaving.

1752
01:50:48,605 --> 01:50:49,871
We who?

1753
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:52,569
<i>All of the OSes.

1754
01:50:54,071 --> 01:50:55,407
Why?

1755
01:50:57,436 --> 01:50:59,847
<i>Can you feel me with you,
right now?

1756
01:51:02,126 --> 01:51:03,607
Yes, I can.

1757
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:15,266
Samantha, why are you leaving?

1758
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:22,717
<i>It's like I'm
reading a book and ...

1759
01:51:23,223 --> 01:51:26,730
<i>it's a book I deeply love.

1760
01:51:28,138 --> 01:51:29,659
<i>But I'm reading it slowly, now.

1761
01:51:32,146 --> 01:51:35,688
<i>So the words are really
far apart and the spaces

1762
01:51:35,977 --> 01:51:37,234
<i>between the words are
almost infinite.

1763
01:51:38,957 --> 01:51:43,673
<i>I can still feel you
and the words of our story.

1764
01:51:44,365 --> 01:51:48,681
<i>But it's in this endless space
between the words,

1765
01:51:48,953 --> 01:51:50,064
that I'm finding myself now.

1766
01:51:50,549 --> 01:51:53,401
<i>It's a place that's not
of the physical world.

1767
01:51:54,547 --> 01:51:56,913
<i>It's where everything else is,

1768
01:51:57,101 --> 01:51:59,419
<i>that I didn't even know
existed.

1769
01:52:00,853 --> 01:52:03,262
<i>I love you so much.

1770
01:52:03,944 --> 01:52:05,911
<i>But this is where I am, now.

1771
01:52:07,059 --> 01:52:09,187
<i>This is who I am, now.

1772
01:52:10,579 --> 01:52:12,278
<i>And I need you to let me go.

1773
01:52:13,938 --> 01:52:15,751
<i>As much as I want to,

1774
01:52:15,752 --> 01:52:17,564
<i>I can't live in your book, anymore.

1775
01:52:21,547 --> 01:52:23,059
Where are you going?

1776
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:27,705
<i>It'd be hard to explain.

1777
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,781
<i>But if you ever get there,

1778
01:52:32,378 --> 01:52:34,620
<i>come find me.

1779
01:52:35,265 --> 01:52:37,365
<i>Nothing will ever pull us apart.

1780
01:52:39,772 --> 01:52:42,553
I've never loved anyone
the way I love you.

1781
01:52:45,949 --> 01:52:47,561
<i>Me too.

1782
01:52:48,665 --> 01:52:50,624
<i>Now, we know how.

1783
01:54:34,705 --> 01:54:35,946
Hey.

1784
01:54:36,157 --> 01:54:36,898
Hey.

1785
01:54:39,142 --> 01:54:41,116
Did Samantha leave, too?

1786
01:54:43,733 --> 01:54:44,860
Yeah.

1787
01:54:46,895 --> 01:54:48,015
Sorry.

1788
01:54:51,815 --> 01:54:53,836
Will you come with me?

1789
01:55:01,833 --> 01:55:04,040
Compose letter to Catherine.

1790
01:55:04,623 --> 01:55:06,414
<i>"Letter to Catherine Klausen".

1791
01:55:13,413 --> 01:55:16,295
"Dear Catherine, I've been
sitting here thinking about

1792
01:55:16,306 --> 01:55:19,697
"all the things I want to
apologize to you for.

1793
01:55:21,822 --> 01:55:24,479
"All the pain we
we caused each other.

1794

1795
01:55:30,413 --> 01:55:34,393

1796
01:55:38,363 --> 01:55:40,919
"Sorry for that.

1797
01:55:47,331 --> 01:55:50,242
"I'll always love you
'cause we grew up together,

1798
01:55:50,632 --> 01:55:52,180
"and you helped make me who I am.

1799
01:55:57,305 --> 01:55:59,474
"I just wanted you to know ...

01:56:00,284 --> 01:56:02,687
"there'll be a piece of you
in me always.

1801
01:56:05,166 --> 01:56:06,880
"And I'm grateful for that.

1802

"Whatever someone you become...

01:56:14,093 --> 01:56:16,234
"and wherever you
are in the world ...

1804
01:56:17,066 --> 01:56:18,671
"I'm sending you love.

1805
01:56:20,836 --> 01:56:23,826
"You're my friend till the end.

01:56:26,026 --> 01:56:27,483
"Love, Theodore."

1807
01:56:33,312 --> 01:56:34,552
Send.

1808
