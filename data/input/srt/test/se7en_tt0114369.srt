1
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,147
Neighbors heard them screaming
at each other, like, for two hours.

2
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,483
Nothing new.
Then they heard the gun go off.

3
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,817
Both barrels.

4
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,237
A crime of passion.

5
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,073
Yeah.

6
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,825
Just look at all the passion on that wall.

7
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,912
Yeah, well, this is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

8
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,542
The kid see it?

9
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,127
What?

10
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:26,963
The kid.

11
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:28,839
What kind of fucking question is that?

12
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:34,470
We are all gonna be real glad when we
get rid of you, Somerset, you know that?

13
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,682
There's always these questions with you.
Did the kid see it?

14
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,393
Who gives a fuck? He's dead.
His wife killed him.

15
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,354
Anything else has nothing to do with us.

16
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,864
Detective Somerset?

17
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,993
I'm Detective Mills.

18
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,578
Lieutenant, I apologize
for interrupting like this…

19
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,373
…just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

20
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,958
Look, um…

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,501
Mills?

22
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,379
I thought we might
find a bar someplace. Sit, talk--

23
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,423
I'd like to get to the precinct.

24
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,676
You know,
not much time for this transition thing.

25
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,596
I meant to ask you something,
when we spoke on the phone before.

26
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,973
Yeah.

27
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,726
Why here?

28
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,561
I don't follow.

29
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,772
Well, all this effort to get transferred.

30
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:30,693
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

31
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,737
I guess for the same reasons as you.

32
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,115
Or the same reasons you had
before you decided to quit, yeah?

33
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,202
You just met me.

34
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,414
Maybe I'm not understanding
the question.

35
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,208
It's very simple.

36
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,755
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

37
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,299
I've just never seen it done
that way before.

38
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,885
I thought I could do some good.
It would be great…

39
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,763
…if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

40
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,934
– If you're calling the shots, lieutenant--
– Yes.

41
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:08,314
I want you to look
and I want you to listen, okay?

42
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,941
Now, I wasn't standing around
guarding the Taco Bell.

43
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,194
– I've worked Homicide five years.
– Not here.

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,403
I understand that.

45
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:19,116
Well, over the next seven days, detective,
you'll do me the favor of remembering that.

46
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,631
Hey, hey. I almost died.

47
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,240
Shut the fuck up down there!

48
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,384
Hello? Yeah.

49
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,969
Okay.

50
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,388
Say it again.

51
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:15,686
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

52
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,319
Serpico's gotta go.

53
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:27,364
Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid
of this little crusty.

54
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,158
This eye, Serpico.

55
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,784
– Did you get it?
– Got it.

56
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,286
Good.

57
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,012
Coffee? No?

58
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:57,561
Nothing's been touched.
Everything's like I found it.

59
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,396
What time was death established?

60
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,065
Like I said…

61
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,566
…I didn't touch anything.

62
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,737
But he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti
for about 45 minutes now.

63
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,657
Wait a minute.
No one bothers with vital signs?

64
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:10,991
Did I stutter?

65
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,536
This guy ain't breathing
unless he started breathing spaghetti sauce.

66
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,915
– So that's how it's done around here?
– I beg your pardon, detective.

67
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:21,085
But this guy's been sitting
in a pile of his own piss and shit.

68
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,420
If he wasn't dead,
he would've stood up by now.

69
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,756
– All right, thank you, officer.
– Okay.

70
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,758
Thank you.

71
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,852
I wonder.

72
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:45,067
What exactly was the point of the
conversation you were about to get into?

73
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,276
Don't know.

74
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,364
How many times has Barney Fife
found dead bodies that weren't dead?

75
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,409
Drop it.

76
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:19,643
Oof.

77
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:27,359
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.

78
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,128
<i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i>

79
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,672
Oof.

80
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,182
Who said this was murder?

81
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,225
No one.

82
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,522
Guy's heart's gotta be the size
of a canned ham.

83
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:13,989
If this isn't a coronary,
well, ha, ha, I don't know.

84
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,841
Whoops.

85
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,350
How about that?

86
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,986
We had this case once.

87
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,031
Guy dead on the ground.

88
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,366
Knife in his back.

89
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,576
Gotta be murder, right?

90
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,412
Fuck.

91
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,791
Anyway,
big insurance policy involved, yeah?

92
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,671
So the guy took the tip of the blade,
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

93
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,508
And he must've screwed up a few times
because there was multiples back there.

94
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,593
Could you please be quiet?

95
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,145
Wait a minute.

96
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,689
What?

97
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,235
Got a bucket here.

98
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,945
What's in it?

99
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,825
Agh!

100
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,910
Oh, God.

101
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,704
Fucking vomit.

102
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,291
Any blood in it?

103
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,502
I didn't see any. Help yourself.

104
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,634
Are you thinking it's poison?

105
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,179
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

106
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,973
Thinking it's poison, Somerset?

107
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,602
You girls have got Forensics
waiting outside.

108
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,689
– Don't know if we'll all fit, though.
– There's room, light's the problem.

109
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,649
– Hi, how are you?
– Hey.

110
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:17,112
Detective Mills, would you go help
the officers question the neighbors?

111
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,326
– What?
– Send in Forensics on your way out, please.

112
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,968
He's dead.

113
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,013
Thank you, doctor.

114
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:52,189
You've seen my files, right?
You seen the things I've done.

115
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:53,815
Nope.

116
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,654
I did my time on door-to-doors
and walking the beat.

117
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,156
I did that shit for a long time.

118
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,033
And?

119
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,536
Badge on my belt says «detective.»
That's the same as yours.

120
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,415
Look, I made a decision.

121
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,418
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene.

122
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:17,297
Couldn't worry whether you thought you
were getting enough on the playing field.

123
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,840
Hey, man…

124
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,595
…just don't be jerking me off,
that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.

125
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,937
He's been dead a long time.

126
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,147
And I can tell you,
it was not from poison.

127
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,482
Oh, man.

128
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,818
How does someone
let themselves go like that?

129
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,571
It took four orderlies
just to get him on the table.

130
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,785
How'd the fat fuck
ever fit out his front door?

131
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,954
Please. It's obvious he was a shut-in.

132
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,539
Now, look at this.

133
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,249
See how big this stomach is?

134
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,252
And the strange thing is, it stretches.

135
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:58,630
Here. Look at the size of the cardiac orifice,
where the food--

136
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,883
Wait, I see what you're pointing out,
but that means nothing to me.

137
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,512
Okay. He's got lines of distention
across the duodenum.

138
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,598
And the interior wall is ripped open.

139
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,268
This man ate till he burst?

140
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,937
He didn't really burst. Not all the way.

141
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,565
He was hemorrhaging internally.

142
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:20,944
And there was a hematoma in the rectus
and transverse abdominis muscles.

143
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,446
So he did die by eating.

144
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,156
Yes and no.

145
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,868
What about these bruises up here?

146
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,538
Well, I haven't figured that out yet.

147
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,582
Gun pressed against his head?

148
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,083
Pressed hard enough, sure.

149
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,710
Fuck, yeah.

150
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,796
Marks from the front side,
flush with the muzzle.

151
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:45,385
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

152
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,807
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving.

153
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,350
Took his time, too.

154
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,270
Coroner said this could've gone on
more than 12 hours.

155
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,732
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort.

156
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,777
And there was definitely a point
when he passed out.

157
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,488
That's when the killer kicked him
and he burst.

158
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,615
Oof. Sadistic fucker, huh?

159
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,201
When you want somebody
dead, you drive by and shoot.

160
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,412
You don't risk the time it takes
to do this.

161
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,373
– Unless the act itself has meaning.
– Come on.

162
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,336
Somebody had a problem with the fat boy
and decided to torture him.

163
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:20,504
Simple as that.

164
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,672
In the grocery bags,
we found two receipts.

165
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,175
That means the killer stopped
in the middle…

166
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,469
…and made a second trip
to the supermarket.

167
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,012
So?

168
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,350
Hey, man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

169
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,893
This is beginning.

170
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,354
We've got one dead guy, not three.

171
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,564
No motive.

172
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,527
Don't even start that big brain of yours
cooking on this, all right?

173
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,530
Please, I'd like to be reassigned.

174
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,739
– What?
– What?

175
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,867
– What, whoa?
– What in the hell are you talking about?

176
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,411
This can't be my last duty.

177
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,539
It's just gonna go on and on and on.

178
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,748
You're retiring.

179
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,084
Six more days
and you're all the way gone.

180
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,461
Won't be the first time
you've left unfinished--

181
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:05,173
Those other cases were taken
as close to conclusion as humanly possible.

182
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,716
And if I may speak freely?

183
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,218
We're all friends here.

184
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,888
– This should not be his first assignment.
– Oh, come on, I knew it.

185
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,182
This is not my first assignment, you dick.

186
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,433
It's too soon for him.

187
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,395
Hey, man, I'm right here.
You can say that shit to my face.

188
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,230
– Captain--
– It's too soon for you.

189
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,733
Captain, if we can just talk in private?

190
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,944
This isn't working. It's a personal thing.

191
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,654
– Maybe--
– Just shut up, Mills.

192
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,741
Look, I don't have anyone else
to put on this and you know it.

193
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,703
This is Metro. You don't just get to swap.

194
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,496
Give it to me.

195
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,957
– Say what?
– Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.

196
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,251
Sorry, but see you later. Have a nice time.

197
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,087
– Give it to me.
– No, I'm putting you on something else.

198
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,133
Go on, Mills.

199
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,885
Just go on.

200
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,850
I'm sorry, old buddy.

201
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,520
But it looks like you're stuck
cleaning up the fat man.

202
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,497
All right, here we go. Quiet down.

203
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,418
All right, calm down. Calm down.

204
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,295
Quiet down.

205
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,839
Calm down. Quiet down.

206
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,842
Now, here's how it's gonna work.

207
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,930
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

208
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,433
If those questions do not come in a calm,
sane and orderly fashion…

209
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,809
…I'm on my way out here.

210
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,811
Detective? Detective?

211
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,356
– Can I have a moment of your time?
– No.

212
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,197
I will not discuss the details
of this ongoing investigation…

213
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,949
…so don't even bother asking.

214
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,869
<i>I've got shopping tools…</i>

215
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,247
<i>That's 25 Berlin.</i>

216
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,087
That looks like him.

217
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,258
<i>Three items for your case number.</i>

218
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,263
– What you guys got for me?
– Nothing yet, boss.

219
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:23,395
Why don't you guys, uh,
go get a coffee, huh?

220
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,356
<i>We have this breaking story for you.</i>

221
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,400
<i>We're going to go live downtown…</i>

222
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,861
<i>…where defense attorney Eli Gould
was found murdered this morning.</i>

223
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,699
<i>District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.</i>

224
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,744
<i>There could be a conflict of interest--</i>

225
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:44,040
<i>That is ridiculous to the point of being
offensive. There is no conflict whatsoever.</i>

226
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,875
<i>And any claim that there could be…</i>

227
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,295
<i>– …is irresponsible.</i>
<i>– Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.</i>

228
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,296
<i>– Hold on.</i>
<i>– It's rumored you're far…</i>

229
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,133
<i>– …from apprehending a suspect.</i>
<i>– I've come from a meeting…</i>

230
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,927
<i>…of law enforcement officials
and they've assured me…</i>

231
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,806
<i>…they have their very best men on this.</i>

232
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:05,145
<i>This will be the very definition</i>
<i>of swift justice.</i>

233
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,754
Pardon me, George.

234
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,719
– Somerset.
– Come in.

235
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,431
– Have you heard the news?
– Nope, haven't heard.

236
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,392
Eli Gould was found murdered
this morning.

237
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,313
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

238
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,441
Wrote the word «greed» on the floor.

239
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,532
– Greed?
– Yeah, in blood.

240
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,077
Mills is heading up the investigation.

241
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,537
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me?

242
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,624
Could you not do that, please?

243
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,167
Oh, okay.

244
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,128
Well, good for him.

245
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,632
What in the hell are you gonna do
with yourself out there, Somerset?

246
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,759
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.

247
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,135
Fix my house.

248
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,970
Don't you feel it?

249
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,306
Don't you feel that feeling?

250
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,434
You're not gonna be a cop anymore.

251
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,645
That's the whole idea.

252
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,940
I don't think you're leaving.

253
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,651
Hell, you can't leave all this.

254
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,571
Guy's out walking his dog.

255
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,448
Gets attacked.

256
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,326
His watch is taken, his wallet.

257
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,913
While he's lying there
on the sidewalk, helpless…

258
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,375
…his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

259
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,295
This happened just last night
about four blocks from here.

260
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,340
Yeah, I read about it.

261
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:01,136
– I don't understand this place any longer.
– It's the way it's always been.

262
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,512
Maybe you're right.

263
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,013
You do this work.

264
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,851
You were made for it
and I don't think you can deny that.

265
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,562
Maybe I'm wrong.

266
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:15,150
Oh, uh, the coroner
sent this down for you.

267
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,362
Found them in fat boy's stomach,
mixed in with food.

268
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,450
– Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic.
– Set them on the desk, please.

269
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,247
They were, uh…

270
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,457
They were fed to him.

271
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,766
Oh, Lord.

272
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,985
This was found on the wall
behind the refrigerator…

273
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,320
…in the obesity murder scene.

274
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:30,118
«Long is the way and hard
that out of hell leads up to light.»

275
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:32,120
It's from Milton.

276
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,205
<i>Paradise Lost.</i>

277
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,416
All right, I'm confused.

278
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,419
It means that this is beginning.

279
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,589
This was found
behind the same refrigerator.

280
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,882
Written in grease.

281
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,760
There are seven deadly sins, captain.

282
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,595
Gluttony.

283
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,516
Greed.

284
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,980
Sloth, wrath, pride, lust…

285
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,858
…and envy.

286
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,235
– Seven.
– Hold on.

287
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,613
This is not even my desk.

288
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,782
You can expect five more of these.

289
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:12,618
Now, wait a minute.

290
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,789
I can't get involved in this.

291
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,084
Somerset.

292
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,961
He wanted it.

293
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,257
– Damn.
– I'm all over it.

294
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,886
What's wrong with you?

295
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,667
Where you headed?

296
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,589
Far away from here.

297
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,393
– Thanks, George.
– How you doing?

298
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,186
Just a few things to look up.

299
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,271
Okay. Sit where you'd like.

300
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:24,816
How's everybody?

301
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,111
Hi, Smiley.

302
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,780
Come on, George,
the cards are getting cold.

303
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,281
Duty calls.

304
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,466
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

305
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,009
I'll never understand.

306
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,138
All these books…

307
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,640
…a world of knowledge
at your fingertips.

308
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,392
What do you do?

309
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,310
You play poker all night.

310
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,646
Hey, we got culture.

311
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,815
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

312
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,819
All right.

313
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,029
How's this for culture?

314
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,480
You know, Smiley…

315
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,150
…you're really gonna miss us.

316
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,403
I just might.

317
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,879
Fucking Dante.

318
00:29:57,046 --> 00:30:01,425
Goddamn poetry-writing faggot
piece of shit.

319
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,177
Fucker.

320
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,395
Yeah?

321
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,940
Good work, officer.

322
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,907
Thank you, Lord.

323
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,586
Be out of your way in a second.

325
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,851
– You want your chair?
– No. You go ahead.

326
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,436
Yeah?

327
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,476
Phone.

328
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,102
It's a package deal.

329
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:36,312
Comes with the office.

330
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,985
– Mills.
– <i>Honey.</i>

331
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,739
– Are you okay, something wrong?
<i>– No.</i>

332
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:51,202
You dingleberry, I, uh, told you
not to call me here when I'm working.

333
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:54,163
Yeah. Why?

334
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,915
Why?

335
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,376
– Why?
<i>– Come on.</i>

336
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,340
Okay.

337
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,011
It's my wife.

338
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,554
Sorry?

339
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,474
She'd like to speak to you.

340
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,277
Uh, this is Detective Somerset.

341
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,363
<i>Oh, it's nice to speak with you.</i>

342
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,199
Well, it's nice to talk to you too.

343
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,203
I appreciate the offer, but--

344
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:40,000
– Well, in that case I'd be delighted.
<i>– Great.</i>

345
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,170
– Yes, thank you very much.
<i>– Thank you. See you later.</i>

346
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,672
Bye.

347
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,175
Hon, what--?

348
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,852
Well?

349
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,396
– Sorry? Oh, uh.
– What?

350
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:03,107
I've been invited to a late supper
at your apartment.

351
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:04,692
I accepted.

352
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,236
At my-- How's that?

353
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,988
Tonight.

354
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,491
<i>Twenty-one-fifty-seven.</i>

355
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,538
Hello, men.

356
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,874
– Hi, loser.
– Hi, idiot.

357
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:22,877
This is Tracy.

358
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,130
– Somerset.
– Hello.

359
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:29,800
I'm very happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

360
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,927
Except, of course, your first name.

361
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,555
It's William.

362
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:39,018
Hmm, well, it's a good name, William.

363
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,437
William, I'd like you to meet David.

364
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:44,148
– David, this is William.
– Okay, all right, I'm gonna--

365
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,441
I'll be right back.

366
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,735
– How are the kids?
– Good, they're in the room.

367
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,361
Come on in.

368
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,323
Oh, good dogs.

369
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,367
How are you, good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

370
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,121
How are you?

371
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,458
How are you?

372
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,710
You are?

373
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:08,297
– Smells good.
– What?

374
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:09,882
– Uh.
– Oh.

375
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,675
Yeah. I mean, thank you.

376
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:16,722
Um, please have a seat, if you like.
Would you like something to drink?

377
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,349
Uh, no. No, thanks.

378
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,018
– I'll wait.
– Okay, you can just throw that anywhere.

379
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:25,522
You'll have to excuse all this mess.
You know, we're still unpacking.

380
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,985
I understand you two
were high school sweethearts.

381
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,320
Mm-hm.

382
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,740
Pretty hokey, huh?

383
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,326
You know something?

384
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,704
I knew on our first date
that this was the guy I was gonna marry.

385
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,414
– Really?
– Mm-hm.

386
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,918
He was the funniest guy I'd ever met.

387
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,298
Really?

388
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,929
Well, it's kind of rare nowadays,
you know.

389
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,849
I mean, that level of commitment.

390
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,147
Oh, don't worry.

391
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,192
– I won't wear it to the dinner table.
– No, ha, ha.

392
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,862
I, uh-- You know, no matter how
often I see guns, I just--

393
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,991
I can't get used to them.

394
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:18,909
Same here.

395
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,879
Why aren't you married, William?

396
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,215
Oh, Trace, what the hell?

397
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:35,509
I was close once.

398
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,303
It just didn't happen.

399
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,763
It surprises me.

400
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,932
It really does.

401
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,393
Well…

402
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:49,857
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

403
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:51,817
Just ask your husband.

404
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,319
Very true.

405
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,738
Very, very true.

406
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,532
So how long have you lived here?

407
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:59,992
Too long.

408
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,289
How are you liking it?

409
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:11,587
You know, takes time, settle in.

410
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:13,964
It'll be good.

411
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,258
Well, you get numb after awhile.

412
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:19,094
There are things to any city.

413
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,935
Subway.

414
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,064
– It will go away in a minute.
– It's nothing.

415
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,902
Real estate guy.

416
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,403
Fucking piece of…

417
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,363
Sorry, honey. He's…

418
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,866
He shows us the place a few times.

419
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,910
I think he's good. He's efficient.

420
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:44,953
Tracy really likes him.

421
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,458
Then I start wondering why will he only
bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah?

422
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,335
We found out the first night.

423
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:56,757
The soothing, relaxing,
vibrating home, huh?

424
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,809
I'm sorry.

425
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:15,442
Yeah, all right, laugh it up.

426
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,531
I don't know why you're laughing.

427
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,537
All right, already.

428
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,792
The guy would've had to get in…

429
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:34,503
…before the office was closed
and security tightened.

430
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,505
Now, Gould would've been working late.

431
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,716
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

432
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:40,926
Infamous, really.

433
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,303
Now listen,
body was found on Tuesday morning.

434
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,641
The office was closed on Monday, which
means the guy could've gotten in Friday…

435
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:52,062
…laid low till the cleaning crew left then
had his way with Gould all day Saturday…

436
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,773
…Sunday, maybe even Monday.

437
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:56,692
Hey, look at this.

438
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,111
Gould was bound, right arm almost free.

439
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,779
He was handed a butcher's knife.

440
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,575
Check out the scale.

441
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,993
A pound of flesh?

442
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,120
Yeah.

443
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,717
<i>– Merchant of Venice.</i>
– Didn't see it.

444
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:25,053
«This task done and he would go free.»

445
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,390
I'm telling you that chair
was soaked through with sweat.

446
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,309
Of course.

447
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,770
The killer would've wanted Gould
to take his time…

448
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:37,441
…to sit and decide
which cut to make first.

449
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,109
Imagine it.

450
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,570
There's a gun in your face.

451
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,656
Which part of your body is expendable?

452
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,658
What about the love handle?

453
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,578
Cut along the side of his own stomach.

454
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,748
All right, let's take a fresh look at these.

455
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,209
Even though the corpse is there,
look through it.

456
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,085
Edit out the initial shock.

457
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:02,674
Trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it…

458
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,385
…until it's an exhausted possibility.

459
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,346
Just gonna get another beer. Beer?

460
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:09,723
Uh, wine, please.

461
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,775
He's preaching.

462
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,735
He's punishing.

463
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:26,865
The sins were used in medieval sermons.

464
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,993
There were seven cardinal virtues
and seven deadly sins…

465
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,453
…used as teaching tools.

466
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,122
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like in, uh, <i>The Parson's Tale</i> and--

467
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,791
What's this? Uh, Dante.

468
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,168
– You read them?
– Yeah.

469
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,421
Well, parts.
Hey, remember in, uh, <i>Purgatory</i>?

470
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,966
Dante and his buddy,
they're climbing up the hill…

471
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,301
…they're checking out
all the sinners, yeah?

472
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:49,763
– Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation.
– Yeah, yeah, right.

473
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,183
But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.

474
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,354
Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider
that the books were the killer's inspiration.

475
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,983
The sermons
were about atonement for sin.

476
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,277
These murders are like forced attrition.

477
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:06,029
– Forced what?
– Attrition.

478
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,991
It's when you regret your sins,
but not because you love God.

479
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,202
Oh, like because someone's sticking
a fucking gun in your face.

480
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,829
Mm-hm.

481
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,583
– No fingerprints.
– Nope.

482
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,004
– Totally unrelated victims.
– Yup.

483
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,631
And no witnesses of any kind.

484
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,466
Which I don't get.

485
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,886
Because the fucker had to get back out.

486
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:34,975
Well, in any major city,
minding your own business is a science.

487
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:39,021
The first thing they teach women
in rape prevention is never cry for help.

488
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,356
Always yell «Fire.»

489
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,816
Nobody answers to «Help.»

490
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,901
You holler «fire,» they come running.

491
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:46,737
That's fucked up.

492
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,198
He must've left another puzzle piece.

493
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:52,909
You know what?

494
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,371
Thank you for talking this out,
but I gotta sleep.

495
00:40:56,747 --> 00:41:00,167
– Walk the dogs.
– This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.

496
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,045
– I'm still leaving at the end of the week.
– Oh, shit.

497
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,838
No, wait, wait.

498
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,842
Gould's wife.
She was out of town at the time.

499
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,220
– So this means she saw something.
– What if it's a threat?

500
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,057
Well, I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

501
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,860
What if it isn't something she has seen?

502
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:31,114
But something she's supposed to see,
but hasn't been given a chance?

503
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:32,991
Yeah, okay. What?

504
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,118
I don't know.

505
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,997
But that's the one thing.

506
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,669
Sign us in.

507
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:27,921
Gotta see Mrs. Gould.

508
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,424
– treat me like a prisoner.

509
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,760
Why do you have a phone
if I can't make long distance phone calls?

510
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,011
Mrs. Gould?

511
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,596
Don't treat people like this.

512
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,104
Mrs. Gould, I am sorry. I truly am.

513
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,606
I don't understand.

514
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,862
Okay, I need you
to look at each photo very carefully.

515
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:56,992
Look and see if there's anything strange
or out of place.

516
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,160
Um, anything at all.

517
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,246
– I don't see anything.
– You're sure?

518
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,915
Please, I just-- I can't do this right now.

519
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,709
Okay.

520
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:07,752
It's got to be now.

521
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,213
There may be something
we haven't seen.

522
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,474
Wait.

523
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,893
– What?
– Here.

524
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,858
This painting, it's upside down.

525
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,242
– You sure your men didn't move this?
– No, no.

526
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:42,120
Those shots were taken before forensics.

527
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:46,666
Nothing.

528
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:50,212
There's gotta be something.

529
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,391
– Moved the screws to rehang it.
– Yep.

530
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,439
What the fuck is that?

531
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:12,275
Switchblade.

532
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,118
Goddamn it.

533
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:28,083
There must be something.

534
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,382
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

535
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,059
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

536
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:49,145
See this? This is us.

537
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,814
Yeah.

538
00:44:50,981 --> 00:44:52,607
Just wait a minute.

539
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,153
Now Somerset's climbing
on the furniture.

540
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,281
Just wait a minute.

541
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,996
You're kidding me.

542
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,623
Call the Print Lab.

543
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,463
Oh, man.

544
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:22,971
Honestly, have you ever
seen anything like this?

545
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,099
No.

546
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:30,979
I can tell you, guys,
just by looking at the swirl pattern…

547
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,773
…they're not the victim's fingerprints.

548
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:48,496
I don't know, man.
I say he's whacked enough.

549
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,916
It doesn't fit.

550
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:54,461
– He doesn't wants us to help him stop.
– Who knows?

551
00:45:54,628 --> 00:45:58,632
So many freaks out there doing
their little evil deeds they don't wanna do.

552
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,885
«The voices made me do it.
My dog made me do it.

553
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:03,845
Jodie Foster told me to do it.»

554
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,599
You know, um, I've seen this baby take
as long as three days to make a match…

555
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:11,269
…so maybe you guys
wanna cross your fingers somewhere else.

556
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:17,359
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you?

557
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,737
– About catching this guy.
– Yeah.

558
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:22,030
Hmm.

559
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,784
Wish I still thought the way you do.

560
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,705
Why don't you tell me what the hell it is
you think we're doing then.

561
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:33,333
Picking up the pieces.

562
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:39,339
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples.

563
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,466
Writing everything down.

564
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,302
Noting the time things happened.

565
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:48,556
– That's all?
– That's all.

566
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:52,769
Putting everything into neat little piles
and filing it away.

567
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:56,898
On the off chance
it will ever be needed in the courtroom.

568
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:02,362
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island.

569
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:06,074
Saving them in case we get rescued.

570
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,578
Bullshit.

571
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,751
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

572
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:22,006
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

573
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:28,179
Don't try to tell me
you didn't get that rush tonight.

574
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:30,598
I saw you.

575
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,268
We're getting somewhere.

576
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,160
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

577
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,620
You've got a winner.

578
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:02,088
This guy goes by the name of Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

579
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,924
His prints were found
at the scene by Homicide.

580
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,553
He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.

581
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,890
His parents gave him
a very strict Southern Baptist upbringing.

582
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,726
But somewhere along the line,
they fell short.

583
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,771
Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery and assault.

584
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:21,608
Spent time in prison here a while back
for the attempted rape of a minor.

585
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:24,235
But his lawyer saw to it
that didn't last long.

586
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,988
His lawyer, by the way,
is the recently deceased Eli Gould.

587
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,740
– Greed murder victim.
– Yes, sir.

588
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:31,659
We're gonna finish this thing up today,
ladies and germs.

589
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:35,830
Victor's been out of circulation a while,
but there's still a residence in his name.

590
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,707
You're not buying all this, are you?

591
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:41,836
– Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?
– You tell me.

592
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:44,506
Our killer seems to have more purpose.

593
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:14,828
You ever take a bullet?

594
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,665
Never in my 34 years, knock wood.

595
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:24,170
I've only taken my gun out three times
with the intention of using it.

596
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:25,672
Never pulled the trigger.

597
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,799
Not once.

598
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:29,050
You?

599
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:35,390
Yeah, but, no, I never took a bullet,
but I pulled my gun once, shot it once.

600
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:37,600
– Really?
– It was my first one of these.

601
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,978
We were a secondary unit.

602
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:43,231
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie then.

603
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:46,693
Anyway, we bust open the door
looking for this junkie and, uh…

604
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,237
…the fucker just opened fire on us.

605
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,197
One cop got hit in the arm.

606
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,451
Christ, what was his name?

607
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,788
Spun him like a top.

608
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,040
You know,
I mean, more like slow motion.

609
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,586
I remember…

610
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,088
…riding in that ambulance.

611
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,216
Well, he died right there.

612
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,427
Right there.

613
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,929
Christ, what was his fucking name?

614
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,987
– All rise.
– Let's do it. Let's do it.

615
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:34,407
Go, go, go. Move.

616
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,620
Okay.

617
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,307
Get up there.

618
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:36,094
SWAT goes before dicks.

619
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,720
Hey.

620
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,099
They love this.

621
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,434
Police.

622
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,812
Clear.

623
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,524
– Clear.
– Clear.

624
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:50,900
Clear.

625
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:05,707
Clear.

626
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,466
Morning, sweetheart.

627
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,885
Get up now, motherfucker.

628
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,345
Now!

629
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,440
Get up, you sack of shit.

630
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,740
Oh, fuck me.

631
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:43,077
Dicks, you'll wanna
come take a look at this.

632
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,498
Dicks!

633
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,213
Oof.

634
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,423
Jesus.

635
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,633
– Victor?
– What the hell?

636
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,052
Yeah, it's just Victor.

637
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,179
– Call an ambulance.
– What is this?

638
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,598
– Hearse more like it.
– Also Forensics.

639
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:05,975
– California, get your people out.
– Go on now.

640
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,602
No one touches anything.

641
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:09,937
It's some frigging wax sculpture
or something.

642
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:15,276
«Sloth.»

643
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,079
Oh, man.

644
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,039
Goddamn.

645
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,917
Those pictures were dated three days ago.

646
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:41,094
This must be the first one. Look.

647
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:44,430
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

648
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:52,480
I got a hair sample, I got a stool sample,
I got piss, I got fingernails.

649
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:58,569
– He's laughing at us.
– You got what you deserved.

650
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,074
He's alive, he's alive!

651
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,034
– That cocksucker's alive!
– Guns down.

652
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:08,162
– Still breathing!
– Guns down! Emergency on that ambulance!

653
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,088
Coming through.

654
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,433
– He's playing games.
– No shit.

655
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:32,145
Look, we have to divorce ourselves
from emotion here.

656
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,354
Oh.

657
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:35,523
No matter how hard it is,
we have to remain focused.

658
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,859
Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.
How's that?

659
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,820
– Are you listening to me?
– Yes, I can hear you.

660
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:42,613
– Excuse me.
– What are you doing?

661
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,366
– Closed crime scene, get out.
– I got a right to be here.

662
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:46,909
– UPI photographer.
– Get out.

663
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:49,829
– Hey, I got a fucking right to be here.
– Get out of here.

664
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,914
– Get out. Jesus.
– Fucking jerk. Fuck you.

665
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:53,708
– I got your picture, man.
– Oh, yeah?

666
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,334
– I got your picture.
– Yeah?

667
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,546
Detective Mills, M-l-L-L-S, fuck off.

668
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,007
– I'm surprised you can spell.
– Fuck you.

669
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,093
How do they get here so fucking quick?

670
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,637
They pay police for the information.

671
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:07,847
And they pay well.

672
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:10,683
Hey, man, I'm sorry, I…

673
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,518
Those, ugh…

674
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,396
– You know, they piss me off.
– It's okay.

675
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:18,065
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

676
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:27,074
A year of immobility seems about right…

677
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,161
…judging by the deterioration
of the muscles and the spine.

678
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,831
Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

679
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,249
Even an antibiotic…

680
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:39,629
…which must've been administered
to keep the bed sores from infecting.

681
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,758
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

682
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:46,594
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is…

683
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:49,639
…he chewed off
his own tongue long ago.

684
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,226
Uh, Doc.

685
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:57,271
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

686
00:55:57,772 --> 00:56:03,069
Detective, he'd die of shock right now
if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.

687
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:06,781
He's experienced about as much pain
and suffering as anyone I've encountered.

688
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:08,783
Give or take.

689
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:12,245
And he still has hell to look forward to.

690
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:13,538
Good night.

691
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,541
<i>Tonight we bring you</i>
<i>the Charlie Parker Quintet.</i>

692
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,711
<i>Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on piano,</i>
<i>Herb Pomeroy's trumpet…</i>

693
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:25,424
<i>…Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums,
and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.</i>

694
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,135
– Yeah?
– <i>Hello, William?</i>

695
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,014
<i>– It's Tracy.</i>
– Tracy?

696
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:36,519
– Is everything all right?
<i>– Yeah, yes, everything's fine.</i>

697
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:38,354
– Where's David?
<i>– He's just, uh--</i>

698
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,898
<i>He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.</i>

699
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,985
<i>Um, I'm sorry to call you like this.</i>

700
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,028
Oh, it's all right. Um…

701
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:48,030
What can I do for you, Tracy?

702
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,158
I, uh…

703
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:53,661
Um, heh.

704
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,705
I need someone to talk to.

705
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:59,333
Do you think
you could meet me somewhere…

706
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,002
…maybe tomorrow morning?

707
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,338
I don't understand.

708
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:08,050
<i>I feel stupid calling, but, uh…</i>

709
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:12,513
…you're the only person
that I know here.

710
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,015
There's no one else.

711
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:18,644
<i>If you can, just, uh, give me a call, okay?</i>

712
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,813
<i>I have to go now.</i>

713
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,691
<i>– Well, good night.</i>
– Good night.

714
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:36,829
I mean, you know this city so well.

715
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:40,958
You've been here so long.

716
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,211
It can be a hard place.

717
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:47,048
I don't know why I asked you to come.

718
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:51,177
Why don't you talk to him about it?

719
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:53,012
Tell him how you feel.

720
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,058
I can't. You know, I can't be a burden.

721
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,310
Especially now.

722
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:03,064
I'll get used to things.

723
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,191
You know? I think I just…

724
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:09,653
I wanted to talk to someone
who's lived here for a long time and…

725
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:16,202
I mean, upstate, you know,
it's a completely different environment.

726
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,374
Did David tell you
that I teach fifth grade?

727
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,209
Well, I did.

728
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:27,004
Uh, he mentioned it.

729
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:33,594
I've been going around,
you know, looking at schools.

730
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:39,767
But the conditions here are horrible.

731
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,103
What about private schools?

732
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,233
I don't know.

733
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:51,445
Why don't you tell me
what's really bothering you, Tracy.

734
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:56,242
David and I are gonna have a baby.

735
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,706
Oh, Tracy, I…

736
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:05,710
I don't think I'm the, heh…

737
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,170
I'm the one to talk to about this.

738
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:10,589
I hate this city.

739
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:16,929
I had a relationship once.

740
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,306
It was very much like a marriage.

741
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:24,311
We got pregnant.

742
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:27,106
This was a long time ago.

743
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:36,323
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

744
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:42,872
Just another day like any other, except
it was the first day after I knew about…

745
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,082
…the pregnancy.

746
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:51,338
And I felt this fear for the first time ever.

747
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:57,762
I remember thinking how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

748
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:02,183
How can--? How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

749
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:12,109
I told her I didn't want to have it.

750
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,905
And over the next few weeks…

751
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:19,325
…I wore her down.

752
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,954
I wanna have children.

753
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,711
I can tell you now that…

754
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,380
I'm-- I know, I mean…

755
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:39,512
I'm positive
that I made the right decision.

756
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,972
But there's not a day that passes…

757
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:46,602
…that I don't wish
that I had made a different choice.

758
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,316
If you don't keep…

759
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:57,238
The baby, I mean,
if that's your decision…

760
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:01,492
…don't ever tell him
that you were pregnant.

761
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:06,622
But if you choose to have this baby…

762
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:10,668
…you spoil that kid
every chance you get.

763
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:22,137
That's about all the advice
I can give you, Tracy.

764
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,771
I got to go.

765
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:32,606
William.

766
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,531
Thank you.

767
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:58,382
Victor's landlord said there was
an envelope of cash in the office mailbox…

768
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:00,634
…the first of every month.

769
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,557
Quote:

770
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:10,185
«I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant in Apartment 306.

771
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,980
– And nobody ever complained about him.
– Heh.

772
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:15,733
He's the best tenant I've ever had,»
end quote.

773
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,818
Yeah, a landlord's dream.

774
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,653
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

775
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,447
Who pays the rent on time.

776
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:25,492
– I'm sick of all this waiting.
– This is the job.

777
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,287
Why aren't we out there, huh?

778
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:33,667
Why do we gotta sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic does it again?

779
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:36,712
It's dismissive to call him a lunatic.
Don't make that mistake.

780
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:39,506
Come on, he's insane. Look.

781
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,636
Right now he's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties.

782
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,764
Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter.
Ooh.

783
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:50,059
– How's that?
– I don't think so.

784
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,562
His luck will run out.

785
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:56,398
Not depending on luck.

786
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:03,113
We walked into that apartment exactly
one year after he tied Victor to the bed.

787
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,199
One year to the day.

788
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:07,660
– He wanted us to.
– Don't know that for sure.

789
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,578
Oh, yes, we do.

790
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:12,289
This note he left.

791
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:14,166
His first words to us.

792
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:22,007
Fuck him. So what?

793
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,051
He's right, so far.

794
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:28,722
Imagine the will it takes
to keep a man bound for a full year.

795
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,726
To sever his hand
and use it to plant fingerprints.

796
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:35,688
To insert tubes into his genitals.

797
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:40,901
This guy is methodical, exacting,
and worst of all, patient.

798
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,028
He's a nut bag.

799
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:47,449
And just because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

800
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:55,124
– How much money you got?
– I got like 50. 50 bucks.

801
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,252
I propose a field trip. Come on.

802
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:02,589
We'll make a list.

803
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,592
At the top we'll put <i>Purgatory</i>,
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>.

804
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,387
Anything relating
to the seven deadly sins.

805
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:10,013
– Ask yourself--
– Hey, wait, wait.

806
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,933
– what would he study
to do the things he's done?

807
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,144
What are his interests now?

808
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:17,438
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

809
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,314
– Where are we going?
– Library.

810
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,497
Coupons, coupons, free coupons.

811
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,083
Discount-- Discount coupons.

812
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:43,630
They must've had about 50
health violations during the last inspection.

813
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:48,469
Could you at least sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking we're dating.

814
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,637
Give me your money.

815
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:55,934
I'm giving you this, but for some reason,
I don't think I know what we're doing.

816
01:04:58,479 --> 01:04:59,980
Fuck.

817
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,025
– Hey, Somerset, how you doing?
– Okay.

818
01:05:03,192 --> 01:05:06,653
– Didn't figure this was a ménage à trois.
– It's not a problem.

819
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,489
Sit down.

820
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:16,330
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

821
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,999
So I figure we're just fair and square.

822
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,376
– It's a deal.
– All right.

823
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,090
About an hour.

824
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,136
Yeah, help yourself.

825
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,432
Well, that was money well spent.

826
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,684
Yeah.

827
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,652
All right.

828
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:50,030
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more
than I trust most people.

829
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:52,991
Well, good,
because I'm ready to punch you.

830
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:58,914
It's probably nothing,
but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.

831
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,503
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

832
01:06:06,547 --> 01:06:07,631
Who, stinky man?

833
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:12,594
See, for years the FBI's been hooked
into the library system, keeping records.

834
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:17,099
– Mm-hm. Assessing fines?
– No, monitoring reading habits.

835
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:18,600
– Look.
– What?

836
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,644
Certain books are flagged.

837
01:06:20,811 --> 01:06:25,399
Books on, say, nuclear weapons
and, well, <i>Mein Kampf</i>.

838
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:27,442
Anyone who checks out a flagged book…

839
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:30,571
…has his library records fed
into the FBI's computers then on.

840
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,739
Wait, wait, wait, how is this legal?

841
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:35,742
Oh, legal, illegal.
These terms don't apply.

842
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,077
– Oh.
– You--

843
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:41,415
You can't use the information directly.
It's just a useful guide.

844
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:44,251
It might sound silly,
but you can't get a library card…

845
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,420
…without, uh, an ID
and a current phone bill, see?

846
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,926
– So they run a list.
– Precisely.

847
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:56,471
If you wanna know who's reading
<i>Purgatory</i> and <i>Paradise Lost</i>…

848
01:06:56,638 --> 01:07:01,643
…and <i>Helter Skelter</i>,
the FBI's computers will tell us.

849
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,770
– It could give us a name.
– It could.

850
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:07,774
Could get a name of some college kid
writing a term paper on 20th-century crime.

851
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,777
At least you're out of the office.

852
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,654
Get a haircut.

853
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:15,532
– How do you know all this?
– I don't.

854
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,827
– Neither do you.
– Exactly.

855
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:30,881
<i>«The Divine Comedy.
History of Catholicism.»</i>

856
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:33,217
There's a book called
<i>Murderers and Madmen.</i>

857
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:37,179
<i>«Modern Homicide Investigation,</i>
<i>In Cold Blood.</i>

858
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:39,348
<i>Of Human Bondage.»</i> Bondage?

859
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,808
– Not what you think.
– Okay.

860
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,144
<i>«The Marquis de Sade.»</i>

861
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:46,146
– It's the Marquis de Sade.
– Whatever.

862
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:48,690
<i>«The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqua--»</i>
Something.

863
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:51,109
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There it is.

864
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:54,112
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

865
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,865
– Is that it?
– Yeah.

866
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:00,327
– Let's try it.
– Jonathan Doe?

867
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:01,578
Whatever.

868
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,330
We're sure about that name?

869
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:04,498
Yeah.

870
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:07,209
You saw it, John Doe.

871
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:09,795
You wanna go back, I'll go back.

872
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:12,214
Let's take a look at him. Talk to him.

873
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,508
This is crazy.

874
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:17,469
– Ah, we'll just talk to him.
– Uh-huh.

875
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:21,056
«Excuse me, sir.
Are you by any chance a serial killer?»

876
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,059
Okay.

877
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:26,103
You do the talking.

878
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:29,064
– Put that silver tongue of yours to work.
– No.

879
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:31,483
You been talking to my wife?

880
01:08:34,403 --> 01:08:36,655
This is retarded.

881
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:38,615
<i>Charlie's Fucking Angels.</i>

882
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:41,785
A name off a computer.

883
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,707
Mills.

884
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:55,632
Fuck.

885
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:59,553
– You hit?
– No.

886
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:04,641
He's going down, he's going down!

887
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,159
Fifth floor.

888
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:23,785
Mills.

889
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:27,414
Mommy?

890
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,416
Mommy?

891
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:44,723
Police. Is there a back way out?

892
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,266
Lock your door.

893
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:51,980
– What the hell is going on, man?
– Get out of the fucking hall, please.

894
01:10:17,381 --> 01:10:18,882
– Get down.
– Aah!

895
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,133
Hey.

896
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,010
Get the fuck down.

897
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:52,207
Aah!

898
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:57,254
Shit.

899
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:01,174
Get the fuck out of there.

900
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,690
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

901
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:00,317
Goddamn it.

902
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,204
Fuck.

903
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:05,674
Get out of the fucking way! Move!

904
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:08,028
Mills?

905
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:10,697
No.

906
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,427
Mills.

907
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:37,891
– Mills, you okay?
– I'm all right.

908
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,728
I'm all right.

909
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,442
– Where are you going?
– I'm going in.

910
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:50,028
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

911
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,030
– Wait.
– What are you talking about?

912
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:53,573
– He shot at us.
– You can't.

913
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,533
– The hell we can't.
– We need a warrant.

914
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,410
We got probable cause. Come on.

915
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:58,745
Think about it, think.

916
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:00,413
– How did we get here?
– Huh?

917
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,792
– I can't tell anyone this, I can't tell anyone.
– Oh, come on, out of the way.

918
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,835
We have no reason to be here.

919
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,462
– Will you listen to me?
– Get off.

920
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:09,798
– Listen to me, listen.
– Get the fuck off me.

921
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,591
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

922
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:14,260
But would you
just pay attention a minute?

923
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:17,722
If we leave a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

924
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:20,558
The fucking guy will walk.
Now, is that what you want?

925
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,520
By the time we clear a warrant,
someone else-- No, fuck that.

926
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:28,024
– We need a reason to knock on this door.
– No, no.

927
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,318
Think about it.

928
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,154
Okay?

929
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,283
Okay, man. Okay.

930
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,994
You're right. I'm all fucked up.

931
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,122
When you're right, you're right.

932
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:54,217
Well, no point in arguing anymore.

933
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,803
Unless you can fix that.

934
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:01,850
You stupid son of a…

935
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,735
How much money we got left?

936
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:16,239
So, yeah,
like, I noticed this guy going out a lot.

937
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:19,325
When the murders was happening,
so I, um…

938
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,828
– So--
– So you called Detective Somerset, right?

939
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:26,124
Yeah, right, right, so I called the detective,
because this guy was creepy and shit.

940
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:29,002
And one of the murders,
it happened right over there.

941
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:31,796
– Okay. I told you the rest. You got it?
– Called the cops.

942
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:33,006
– Good?
– Got your story.

943
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:34,883
– Have her sign. You gotta sign.
– Okay.

944
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:37,302
Okay? Good, good, good.

945
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:40,180
– All right.
– You did good.

946
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,640
– I did what you said.
– Here you go.

947
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,351
You get something to eat, all right?
You eat.

948
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,565
Everybody, stay outside.

949
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,461
Victor.

950
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:08,721
Somerset!

951
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:13,226
– Somerset!
– Yeah?

952
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:19,315
– What?
– We had him.

953
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:21,275
What are you talking about?

954
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:24,904
The fucking photographer
in the fucking stairs.

955
01:20:29,409 --> 01:20:31,869
We had him and we let him go.

956
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:39,794
You're sure this is him?

957
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:41,254
Yup, good, good. Yup.

958
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:43,089
– Yeah, good, get it out.
– All right.

959
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:46,426
Uh, we've got nothing, no pay stubs,
no appointment books, no addresses.

960
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,428
– This is the best, this receipt.
– Keep looking.

961
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,555
Let me show you something.
This was under the bed.

962
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:52,682
Uh, his only source of funds.

963
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:55,184
No kidding, we got his money.
Fucking A, I like it.

964
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,436
– One thing.
– Yes?

965
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:59,564
You're probably not gonna believe this.
We haven't found a fingerprint yet.

966
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:03,735
– Um, not a single one.
– You're right, I don't. Keep looking.

967
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:09,991
We could use some more men here.

968
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:13,578
Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can.
What are you getting with all this?

969
01:21:13,745 --> 01:21:15,747
There are 2000 notebooks
on these shelves.

970
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,791
And each notebook contains
about 250 pages.

971
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,586
Forget it. Anything about the killings?

972
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:26,215
«What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
and what a gross stage we dance on.

973
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:30,303
What fun we have dancing and fucking.
Not a care in the world.

974
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:32,138
Not knowing that we are nothing.

975
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:34,557
We are not what was intended.»

976
01:21:34,724 --> 01:21:37,143
No, wait, there's a lot more.

977
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:41,481
«On the subway today, a man came up
to me to start a conversation.

978
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:46,152
He made small talk, a lonely man,
talking about the weather and things.

979
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,446
I tried to be pleasant and accommodating.

980
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:51,407
But my head began to hurt
from his banality.

981
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:56,537
I almost didn't notice it had happened,
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

982
01:21:56,829 --> 01:22:01,626
He was not pleased.
And I couldn't stop laughing.»

983
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,961
No dates.

984
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:07,465
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

985
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:11,469
Just his mind poured out on paper.

986
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:13,012
Looks like a life's work.

987
01:22:13,179 --> 01:22:16,557
If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still take two months.

988
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:18,476
I know, I know, I know.

989
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:23,815
Where's that phone?

990
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:28,778
Phone? Phone?

991
01:22:28,945 --> 01:22:30,029
Phone?

992
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:34,951
People, quiet.

993
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,718
– Hello?
– <i>I admire you.</i>

994
01:22:53,553 --> 01:22:57,140
<i>I don't know how you found me,
but imagine my surprise.</i>

995
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:01,018
<i>I respect you law enforcement agents</i>
<i>more every day.</i>

996
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:04,230
Well, I appreciate that, John.

997
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:06,107
– I tell you--
<i>– No, listen, all right?</i>

998
01:23:06,274 --> 01:23:10,361
<i>I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's little setback.</i>

999
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:12,947
<i>I just had to call
and express my admiration.</i>

1000
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:15,950
<i>Sorry I had to hurt one of you…</i>

1001
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:18,744
<i>– …but I didn't really have a choice, did I?</i>
– Hmm.

1002
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,621
<i>You will accept my apology, won't you?</i>

1003
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:23,207
<i>I feel like saying more,
but I don't wanna ruin the surprise.</i>

1004
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:31,007
<i>--adjusting my schedule
after today's little setback.</i>

1005
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:32,508
Got it.

1006
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,764
All right, everybody, back to work.

1007
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,185
– You were right.
– Hmm?

1008
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:45,938
– Ugh, he's preaching.
– Yeah.

1009
01:23:46,564 --> 01:23:48,566
These murders are his sermons to us.

1010
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:52,278
Look, we know him,
we know him, we know him.

1011
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:56,824
Who's the blonde?

1012
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,455
Looks like a pro.

1013
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:04,040
Maybe.

1014
01:24:04,207 --> 01:24:06,542
She caught John Doe's eye.

1015
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,342
Yeah, he came and collected it last night.

1016
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,010
– Last night?
– Yeah.

1017
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:17,637
– This man?
– Yeah, John Doe.

1018
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:20,014
It's an easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1019
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:23,809
– What was this job you did for him?
– I've got a picture of it. Hang on.

1020
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:26,145
One sweet piece, actually.

1021
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:29,649
I thought he was one of them
performance artists, that's what I thought.

1022
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:35,571
You know, the sort of guy that pisses
in a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it.

1023
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:38,115
– Performance art.
– Hmm.

1024
01:24:41,035 --> 01:24:43,204
I think I undercharged him, actually.

1025
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:44,622
You made this for him?

1026
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:47,500
Yeah, I've made weirder shit
than that. So what?

1027
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,216
They found the blonde.

1028
01:24:58,094 --> 01:24:59,512
The picture.

1029
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:00,888
The picture.

1030
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:03,933
Fucking pigs.

1031
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,854
– We need you to move, pal.
– I'll come out, but you guys--

1032
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:12,358
– Get the fuck out of the booth.
– I've been in this cage the whole time.

1033
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:14,735
– Okay?
– I'm not fucking with you.

1034
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,654
Come on, this way.

1035
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,162
Can you do something
about this music?

1036
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,957
Yeah, we're working on it.
We're looking for the guy.

1037
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:42,388
You from Homicide? You--

1038
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:44,515
– You better see this.
– Yeah. All right.

1039
01:25:46,267 --> 01:25:48,769
Hey, easy. Got him?

1040
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:53,232
Get this thing off of me.

1041
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:55,443
Oh, God, get this thing off of me!

1042
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:57,653
Get this thing off of me!

1043
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,822
– Get this off!
– Get him out of here, now.

1044
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:01,449
Get him out of here, now!

1045
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:04,994
Come on, I wanna hear it again.

1046
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:08,414
– Tell me again.
– Just-- I don't know.

1047
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:11,917
You heard nothing strange,
you saw nothing strange.

1048
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,086
– No.
– No.

1049
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:17,465
He asked me if I was married.

1050
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:20,676
– And I could see he had a gun in his hand.
– Where was the girl?

1051
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:23,137
The what? What?

1052
01:26:23,304 --> 01:26:25,765
The girl, the prostitute. Where was she?

1053
01:26:25,973 --> 01:26:28,434
Someone comes to your establishment.

1054
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:31,437
They want to go downstairs
and wanna get a little ooh la la.

1055
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:33,105
Whatever.

1056
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:36,650
– They got to come to you, yeah?
– Yeah.

1057
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,194
You didn't see anyone?

1058
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:42,573
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1059
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:46,994
Hey, everybody that comes in there's
got a package under their arms.

1060
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:50,539
Some guys are carrying suitcases
full of stuff.

1061
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,334
She was just sitting on the bed.

1062
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:02,134
Who tied her down? You or him?

1063
01:27:02,635 --> 01:27:04,929
Do you like what you do for a living?

1064
01:27:05,221 --> 01:27:08,015
– These things you see?
– No.

1065
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,810
No, I don't.

1066
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:14,980
But that's life, isn't it?

1067
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:24,323
He had a gun and he made it happen.

1068
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,868
He made me do it.

1069
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:31,539
He put that thing on me.

1070
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:34,333
And he made me wear it.

1071
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,504
Then he told me to fuck her.

1072
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:42,174
And I did. I fucked her.

1073
01:27:42,967 --> 01:27:44,426
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1074
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,595
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1075
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:50,391
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1076
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:52,017
<i>Fuck.</i>

1077
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,605
<i>Oh, God, God.</i>

1078
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,650
<i>God, help me. Please, please, help me.</i>

1079
01:27:59,817 --> 01:28:01,527
<i>Please, please, help me.</i>

1080
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:21,589
You know,
this isn't gonna have a happy ending.

1081
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:25,176
– It's not possible.
– Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1082
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:30,097
If we catch John Doe
and he turns out to be the devil--

1083
01:28:30,264 --> 01:28:34,059
I mean, if he's Satan himself,
that might live up to our expectations…

1084
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:37,104
…but he's not the devil.

1085
01:28:38,731 --> 01:28:40,232
He's just a man.

1086
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:42,735
You know…

1087
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:45,738
…see, you bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things. These:

1088
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:51,494
If you think you're preparing me
for hard times, thank you, but…

1089
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:54,830
But you gotta be a hero.

1090
01:28:55,623 --> 01:28:58,918
You wanna be a champion. Let me
tell you, people don't want a champion.

1091
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,587
They wanna eat cheeseburgers,
play lotto and watch TV.

1092
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:03,505
How did you get like this?

1093
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,884
– I wanna know.
– Ah.

1094
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:12,431
It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that.

1095
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,267
Go on.

1096
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,942
I just don't think I can continue to live in a
place that embraces and nurtures apathy…

1097
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,361
…as if it was a virtue.

1098
01:29:25,945 --> 01:29:27,446
You're no different, no better.

1099
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,407
I didn't say I was different or better.
I'm not.

1100
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:33,619
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1101
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:36,121
Apathy is a solution.

1102
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:40,918
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs
than it is to cope with life.

1103
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:43,128
– Yeah.
– It's easier to steal what you want…

1104
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:44,797
– …than it is to earn it.
– Yeah.

1105
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:47,299
It's easier to beat a child
than it is to raise it.

1106
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:50,261
Hell, love costs. It takes effort and work.

1107
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:52,972
We are talking
about people who are mentally ill.

1108
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:55,849
We are talking
about people, fucking crazies.

1109
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,476
– No. No, we're not.
– Yes, today.

1110
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:00,896
We're talking about everyday life here.

1111
01:30:02,273 --> 01:30:04,650
You can't afford to be this naive.

1112
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:06,402
Fuck off.

1113
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:10,823
See, you should listen to yourself. Yeah.

1114
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:14,660
You say that the problem
with people is that they don't care.

1115
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:17,496
So I don't care about people.

1116
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,373
It makes no sense. You know why?

1117
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,834
– Uh, you care?
– You wanna know--?

1118
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:24,503
– Damn right.
– And you're gonna make a difference?

1119
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:28,966
Whatever, the point is,
is that I don't think you're quitting…

1120
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:32,344
…because you believe these things
you say. I don't.

1121
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:36,015
I think you wanna believe them
because you're quitting.

1122
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:41,103
You want me to agree and say,
«Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

1123
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,230
It's all fucked up. It's a fucking mess.

1124
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:46,817
We should all go live
in a fucking log cabin.»

1125
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:49,194
But I won't.

1126
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:51,488
I won't say that.

1127
01:30:52,323 --> 01:30:55,743
I don't agree with you. I do not.

1128
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,914
I can't.

1129
01:31:10,341 --> 01:31:12,176
I'm gonna go home.

1130
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:21,560
Thank you, though.

1131
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:53,592
I love you, honey.

1132
01:31:54,093 --> 01:31:56,220
So much.

1133
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,431
So much.

1134
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:05,479
I know.

1135
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,002
911, what's your emergency?

1136
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:11,879
Could you repeat that?

1137
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:15,507
<i>I've gone and done it again.</i>

1138
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:26,769
What have we got?

1139
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:29,354
Uh, sleeping pills.

1140
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:31,690
Glued to one hand.

1141
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:33,400
Telephone glued to the other.

1142
01:33:35,194 --> 01:33:36,361
You see what he did?

1143
01:33:37,488 --> 01:33:38,864
He sliced her up.

1144
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:40,949
Then he bandaged her.

1145
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,535
Call for help and you'll live.

1146
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:45,996
But you'll be disfigured.

1147
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:49,917
Or you can put yourself
out of your own misery.

1148
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:52,044
Come on.

1149
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:53,545
Cut off her nose.

1150
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:55,380
To spite her face.

1151
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,217
And he did it very recently.

1152
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,725
Listen.

1153
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:12,397
I've decided to stay on till this is done.
I figure one of two things will happen.

1154
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:17,194
We'll get John Doe or he'll finish his series
of seven and this case will go on for years.

1155
01:34:17,361 --> 01:34:20,572
Hey man, you don't have to do me
any favors. Thank you, but I got it.

1156
01:34:20,739 --> 01:34:24,076
I'm requesting that you keep
me on as your partner for a few more days.

1157
01:34:24,243 --> 01:34:26,161
You'd be doing me a favor.

1158
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:38,382
You knew I'd say yes.

1159
01:34:38,549 --> 01:34:40,008
– Hey, we're here.
– Wonderful.

1160
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:43,637
Your wife called.
Get yourself an answering machine.

1161
01:34:45,806 --> 01:34:47,474
Detective?

1162
01:34:48,684 --> 01:34:50,936
After this, I'm gone.

1163
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,939
– No big surprise.
– Detective!

1164
01:34:56,942 --> 01:34:58,318
You're looking for me.

1165
01:34:58,777 --> 01:34:59,778
Hey!

1166
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,615
Don't you fucking move.
On the fucking floor.

1167
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:05,075
Keep away from him!

1168
01:35:05,242 --> 01:35:06,952
– On the fucking floor.
– I know you.

1169
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:08,495
Now. Get down.

1170
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:11,915
Get down on your stomach,
you piece of shit.

1171
01:35:12,082 --> 01:35:13,959
Now. All the way!

1172
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:16,295
All the way, fucker! Down!

1173
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:19,006
Faster. Faster. Faster, fucker.

1174
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:22,426
Now. Nose on the ground.

1175
01:35:25,262 --> 01:35:28,056
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1176
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:31,393
I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please.

1177
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:35,022
Goddamn it.

1178
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:38,984
He cuts the skin off the tips
of his fingers.

1179
01:35:39,151 --> 01:35:43,405
That's why we couldn't find one single
usable print in his apartment.

1180
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:45,908
Looks like he's been doing it
for a quite sometime.

1181
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,493
What about the bank accounts? The guns?

1182
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,495
So far everything's a dead end.

1183
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:53,415
No credit history. No employment records.

1184
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:57,336
His bank account's only 5 years old
and it was started with cash.

1185
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:59,379
We're even trying to trace his furniture.

1186
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:01,965
About only thing we know about that guy
right now…

1187
01:36:02,132 --> 01:36:06,970
…is that he's independently wealthy,
well-educated and totally insane.

1188
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:09,139
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1189
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:11,850
– Okay, so when do we get to question him?
– You don't.

1190
01:36:12,017 --> 01:36:13,852
– He going to court now.
– What?

1191
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:16,480
I'm telling you,
there's no way he'd turn himself in.

1192
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:18,273
It doesn't make any sense.

1193
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:22,027
Well, there he sits.
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1194
01:36:22,194 --> 01:36:24,863
– He's not finished.
– No, he's pissing in our faces.

1195
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:29,284
We're just taking it like idiots.
You know what I'm talking about.

1196
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:33,372
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1197
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:37,042
– He wouldn't just stop.
– Ugh, so, what the fuck, man?

1198
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:40,420
He's two murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1199
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,924
We'll wait for his plea.

1200
01:36:47,052 --> 01:36:51,640
My client says there are two more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1201
01:36:51,807 --> 01:36:54,601
He will take Detectives Mills
and Somerset to these bodies…

1202
01:36:54,768 --> 01:36:58,939
…but only Detective Mills and Somerset,
only at 6:00 today.

1203
01:36:59,106 --> 01:37:00,691
Why us?

1204
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,317
He says he admires you.

1205
01:37:04,069 --> 01:37:05,404
It's part of the game.

1206
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:08,323
The client claims
if the detectives do not accept this…

1207
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:12,411
– …these bodies will never be found.
– Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1208
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:13,829
Hey.

1209
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,247
We've got him.

1210
01:37:15,414 --> 01:37:17,624
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1211
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:20,836
He's gonna get his free room and board,
get his free cable TV.

1212
01:37:21,003 --> 01:37:24,464
Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we having this conversation?

1213
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:27,092
– Mills.
– No. Hey, something stinks.

1214
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:28,427
And this one here--

1215
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:32,264
Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit
and that smug smile on your face…

1216
01:37:32,431 --> 01:37:35,016
– …dealing for that shit, I don't like it--
– Mills.

1217
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:37,436
I am required by law to serve my clients…

1218
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,354
– …to the best of my ability.
– Aw, Jesus.

1219
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:42,983
– To serve their best interest.
– We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1220
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,569
My client wishes inform you
if you do not accept…

1221
01:37:45,736 --> 01:37:48,363
…he will plead insanity across the board.

1222
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:50,198
Let him try it.

1223
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:51,491
I'd like to see him try.

1224
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:54,661
Come on, now, we all know
the extreme nature of these crimes…

1225
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:57,247
…I could get him off with such a plea.

1226
01:37:57,414 --> 01:38:00,125
I'm not letting this conviction slide.
I can tell you that.

1227
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:03,920
He says that if you do accept
under his specific conditions…

1228
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,715
…he'll sign a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1229
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,301
It's your case. Make a decision.

1230
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,721
Full confession.

1231
01:38:12,888 --> 01:38:15,682
– I'm in.
– It has to be the both of you.

1232
01:38:17,142 --> 01:38:22,606
If he were to claim insanity,
this conversation is admissible.

1233
01:38:22,773 --> 01:38:25,025
The fact that he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1234
01:38:25,192 --> 01:38:27,819
And my client would like to remind you
two more are dead.

1235
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,488
Press would have a field day…

1236
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:32,616
…if they find out the police didn't seem
concerned about them.

1237
01:38:32,783 --> 01:38:35,994
– Giving them a proper burial.
– If in fact there are two more dead.

1238
01:38:36,161 --> 01:38:40,332
Lab report came up from downtown. They
did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails.

1239
01:38:40,499 --> 01:38:44,002
They found blood from Doe.
From him slicing his fingers.

1240
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:46,797
Blood from the woman
who's face he cut off.

1241
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:51,676
And blood from a third party,
as yet unidentified.

1242
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:56,973
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1243
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:01,478
Let's finish it.

1244
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:08,110
If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO should fly out…

1245
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:11,029
…I want you to have expected it.

1246
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,366
I will.

1247
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:18,912
Hey, man, if I was
to accidentally shave off a nipple…

1248
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:20,705
…would it be covered
by workman's comp?

1249
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:21,873
Hmm.

1250
01:39:26,086 --> 01:39:28,171
I suppose so.

1251
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,382
– Yeah.
– If you were man enough…

1252
01:39:30,549 --> 01:39:34,761
…to actually file a claim,
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1253
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,974
If I keep coming home late,
my wife's gonna think something's up.

1254
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:49,568
You know…

1255
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:52,028
Yeah.

1256
01:39:57,868 --> 01:39:59,161
What?

1257
01:41:10,774 --> 01:41:11,983
Let's go.

1258
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,849
<i>C-Victor-5-5 take. Clear the TC.</i>

1259
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:46,268
Pull around.

1260
01:41:47,686 --> 01:41:50,772
<i>There it is.</i>
<i>Late-model black sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i>

1261
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:01,199
Who are you, John?

1262
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:04,077
Who are you really?

1263
01:42:04,369 --> 01:42:05,453
What do you mean?

1264
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:09,374
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us a bit about yourself?

1265
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:13,044
It doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1266
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:15,130
You need to stay on your left up here.

1267
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:21,094
So where are we heading?

1268
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:22,804
You'll see.

1269
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:27,058
We're not just going to pick up
two more dead bodies, are we, John?

1270
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:29,436
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1271
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:32,731
We've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1272
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:36,026
Wanting people to listen…

1273
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:39,738
…you can't just tap them
on the shoulder anymore.

1274
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:42,282
You have to hit them
with a sledgehammer.

1275
01:42:42,449 --> 01:42:45,410
And then you'll notice
you've got their strict attention.

1276
01:42:45,577 --> 01:42:47,454
But the question is:

1277
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,290
What makes you so special
that people should listen?

1278
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:51,958
I'm not special.

1279
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:55,587
<i>I've never been exceptional.</i>

1280
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,591
<i>This is, though, what I'm doing.</i>
<i>My work.</i>

1281
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:01,342
Your work, John?

1282
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:03,053
Yes.

1283
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:06,181
See, I don't--
I don't see anything special about it, John.

1284
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:08,641
That's not true.

1285
01:43:08,808 --> 01:43:09,893
No, it is true.

1286
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:13,229
And the funny thing is, all this work…

1287
01:43:13,396 --> 01:43:15,398
…two months from now,
no one's gonna care.

1288
01:43:15,565 --> 01:43:17,901
No one's gonna give a shit,
no one's gonna remember.

1289
01:43:18,068 --> 01:43:21,112
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1290
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:23,448
But when this is done…

1291
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:26,117
…when it's finished…

1292
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:29,454
…it's going to be…

1293
01:43:32,457 --> 01:43:35,794
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1294
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,004
But they won't be able to deny.

1295
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:41,091
Could the freak be more vague?

1296
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:44,511
I mean, as far as master plans go, John--

1297
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:48,515
I can't wait for you to see. I really can't.
It's really going to be something.

1298
01:43:49,599 --> 01:43:52,310
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be standing next to you.

1299
01:43:52,477 --> 01:43:55,730
So when this big thing happens,
you be sure and let me know.

1300
01:43:55,897 --> 01:43:59,400
– Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.
– Oh, don't worry.

1301
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:00,610
You won't.

1302
01:44:02,612 --> 01:44:04,739
You won't miss a thing.

1303
01:44:11,329 --> 01:44:14,624
<i>With the tour bus itself,
give two miles separation.</i>

1304
01:44:31,391 --> 01:44:32,725
What's so exciting?

1305
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:35,854
It's not too far now.

1306
01:44:39,566 --> 01:44:41,317
<i>High-tension lines ahead.</i>

1307
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:42,652
<i>Prepare for frequency change.</i>

1308
01:44:43,278 --> 01:44:45,572
I've been trying to figure something
in my head.

1309
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:48,116
And maybe you can help me out, yeah?

1310
01:44:49,534 --> 01:44:53,705
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are…

1311
01:44:53,872 --> 01:44:56,207
…do you know that you're insane?

1312
01:44:56,374 --> 01:44:58,793
Maybe you're sitting around,
reading <i>Guns and Ammo…</i>

1313
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,213
…masturbating in your own feces,
do you just stop and go:

1314
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:05,884
«Wow, it is amazing how fucking crazy
I really am»?

1315
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:08,553
Yeah? Do you guys do that?

1316
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:12,056
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1317
01:45:12,223 --> 01:45:13,433
It's very comfortable.

1318
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:17,562
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1319
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:20,732
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1320
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:24,777
– Well, whatever.
– I don't doubt that you believe that, John.

1321
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:29,407
But seems to me that you're overlooking
a glaring contradiction.

1322
01:45:29,574 --> 01:45:30,825
Meaning what?

1323
01:45:32,035 --> 01:45:33,953
Glad you asked.

1324
01:45:35,288 --> 01:45:36,915
If you were chosen…

1325
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:40,919
…that is, by a higher power…

1326
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:43,504
…and if your hand was forced…

1327
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:47,175
…it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment out of it.

1328
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:50,720
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1329
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:54,933
This doesn't seem in keeping
with martyrdom, does it?

1330
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,310
John?

1331
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:05,026
I doubt I enjoyed it
any more than Detective Mills…

1332
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:08,905
…would enjoy time alone with me
in a room without windows.

1333
01:46:09,489 --> 01:46:11,282
Isn't that true?

1334
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:14,536
How happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity.

1335
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:15,787
That hurts my feelings.

1336
01:46:17,372 --> 01:46:20,541
– I would never--
– You wouldn't because there's consequences.

1337
01:46:22,043 --> 01:46:24,671
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1338
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:27,507
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1339
01:46:28,258 --> 01:46:33,179
I won't deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner.

1340
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:37,433
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1341
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:42,021
Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?

1342
01:46:42,897 --> 01:46:44,357
An obese man.

1343
01:46:44,524 --> 01:46:47,026
A disgusting man
who could barely stand up.

1344
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:51,489
If you saw him, you'd point him out to your
friends so they'd join you in mocking him.

1345
01:46:51,656 --> 01:46:53,950
A man, who if you saw him
while you were eating…

1346
01:46:54,117 --> 01:46:56,661
…you wouldn't be able
to finish your meal.

1347
01:46:56,953 --> 01:47:00,498
And after him, lawyer. You must've
secretly been thanking me for that one.

1348
01:47:00,999 --> 01:47:03,918
This is a man who dedicated his life…

1349
01:47:04,085 --> 01:47:08,715
…to making money by lying
with every breath that he could muster…

1350
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:11,759
…to keeping murderers and rapists
on the streets.

1351
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:13,344
– Murderers?
– A woman.

1352
01:47:13,511 --> 01:47:15,596
– Murderers, John, like yourself?
– A woman…

1353
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:18,474
…so ugly inside that she
couldn't bear to go on living…

1354
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,935
…if she couldn't be beautiful
on the outside?

1355
01:47:21,102 --> 01:47:25,523
A drug dealer.
A drug dealing pederast, actually.

1356
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:28,359
And let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.

1357
01:47:30,611 --> 01:47:33,031
Only in a world this shitty…

1358
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:36,909
…could you try to say these were
innocent people and keep a straight face.

1359
01:47:40,121 --> 01:47:41,998
But that's the point.

1360
01:47:43,166 --> 01:47:46,210
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner…

1361
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:49,255
…in every home and we tolerate it.

1362
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:52,675
We tolerate it
because it's common, it's…

1363
01:47:52,842 --> 01:47:54,510
It's trivial.

1364
01:47:54,677 --> 01:47:57,639
We tolerate it morning, noon and night.

1365
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:02,894
Well, not anymore.

1366
01:48:04,896 --> 01:48:07,273
I'm setting the example.

1367
01:48:08,274 --> 01:48:09,984
And what I've done is gonna be…

1368
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:11,903
…puzzled over…

1369
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:13,905
…and studied…

1370
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:16,407
…and followed…

1371
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:18,951
…forever.

1372
01:48:19,744 --> 01:48:21,537
Yeah.

1373
01:48:22,413 --> 01:48:24,749
Delusions of grandeur.

1374
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:27,418
You should be thanking me.

1375
01:48:27,919 --> 01:48:29,128
Why's that, John?

1376
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:32,423
Because you're going
to be remembered after this.

1377
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:36,427
Realize, detective, the only reason
that I'm here right now…

1378
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:38,638
…is that I wanted to be.

1379
01:48:38,805 --> 01:48:41,307
No. No, we would've got you eventually.

1380
01:48:41,474 --> 01:48:42,767
Oh, really?

1381
01:48:42,934 --> 01:48:47,188
So, what were you doing, biding your time?
Toying with me?

1382
01:48:47,772 --> 01:48:53,194
Allowing five innocent people to die
until you felt like springing your trap?

1383
01:48:53,361 --> 01:48:57,448
Tell me, what was the indisputable evidence
you were going to use on me…

1384
01:48:57,615 --> 01:49:02,078
…right before I walked up to you
and put my hands in the air?

1385
01:49:02,245 --> 01:49:04,455
John, calm down.

1386
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:06,999
I seem to remember us
knocking on your door.

1387
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:09,168
Oh, that's right.

1388
01:49:09,335 --> 01:49:12,672
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1389
01:49:17,427 --> 01:49:20,263
You're only alive because I didn't kill you.

1390
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:22,390
– Okay, sit back.
– I spared you.

1391
01:49:22,557 --> 01:49:23,599
Sit back.

1392
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:26,060
Remember that every time
you look in the mirror…

1393
01:49:26,227 --> 01:49:28,938
…at that face of yours
for the rest of your life…

1394
01:49:29,105 --> 01:49:30,773
…or should I say for the rest…

1395
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:33,317
– …of what life I allow you to have.
– Sit back.

1396
01:49:33,484 --> 01:49:37,071
Sit back, you fucking freak.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1397
01:49:38,698 --> 01:49:41,451
You're no messiah.
You're a movie of the week.

1398
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:45,204
You're a fucking T-shirt at best.

1399
01:49:58,301 --> 01:50:00,553
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1400
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,138
I don't mourn them any more…

1401
01:50:02,305 --> 01:50:04,849
…than the thousands that died
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1402
01:50:05,183 --> 01:50:09,645
Is that to say, John, that what you
were doing was God's good work?

1403
01:50:12,899 --> 01:50:16,194
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1404
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,239
Do you see those high-tension towers?

1405
01:50:20,698 --> 01:50:23,034
<i>– That's where we're headed.</i>
<i>– I see where.</i>

1406
01:50:23,201 --> 01:50:25,536
<i>Right to your 9 o'clock
and follow that access road.</i>

1407
01:50:31,876 --> 01:50:34,045
<i>Your signal's breaking up, Viking.</i>

1408
01:50:34,212 --> 01:50:37,673
<i>Un-fucking-avoidable, Center.
We're in power-line city, deal with it.</i>

1409
01:50:39,175 --> 01:50:42,011
This sure as shit is no ambush out here.

1410
01:50:42,178 --> 01:50:44,931
– No fucking nothing out here.
– Can't land anywhere near.

1411
01:50:45,097 --> 01:50:47,934
They're gonna be coming up
behind us in about two minutes.

1412
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:50,353
I want you to go up, way up.

1413
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:53,648
Thirty seconds, bank east on my mark.
Thirty seconds.

1414
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:57,461
I'm getting him out.

1415
01:51:59,547 --> 01:52:01,632
<i>Target is now fully into standby.</i>

1416
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:03,467
<i>Got you in sight.</i>

1417
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:05,052
<i>Get out.</i>

1418
01:52:05,595 --> 01:52:07,430
Slowly.

1419
01:52:07,722 --> 01:52:09,223
Stop.

1420
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:11,309
Stay.

1421
01:52:14,061 --> 01:52:15,771
What do you got?

1422
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:18,649
Dead dog.

1423
01:52:19,942 --> 01:52:21,485
I didn't do that.

1424
01:52:25,156 --> 01:52:27,325
<i>We're holding on standby, copy?</i>

1425
01:52:28,326 --> 01:52:29,410
What time is it?

1426
01:52:30,328 --> 01:52:32,914
– Why?
– I'd like to know.

1427
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:37,376
Seven-oh-one.

1428
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:41,756
It's close.

1429
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,008
Let's go take a look.

1430
01:52:47,762 --> 01:52:48,804
It's this way.

1431
01:52:51,849 --> 01:52:53,893
<i>Bird 2, close your distance.</i>

1432
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:56,604
<i>This is Bird 2. They're away from the car.</i>

1433
01:52:56,771 --> 01:52:58,939
<i>Coming in closer.</i>

1434
01:53:00,816 --> 01:53:04,195
<i>We got them. We got them. Closing in.</i>

1435
01:53:04,362 --> 01:53:05,988
<i>Negative. Negative. Hold your go.</i>

1436
01:53:31,973 --> 01:53:33,057
Mills?

1437
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:40,356
Down, down, down.

1438
01:53:41,357 --> 01:53:42,858
Watch him.

1439
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:45,945
There he goes.

1440
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:48,322
<i>It's good we have some time to talk.</i>

1441
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:53,828
<i>Van approaching.</i>

1442
01:53:53,995 --> 01:53:57,415
Stay on the guy in red. Do not take
the crosshairs off the guy in red.

1443
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:04,672
<i>He's going out
to meet the van. Just stay down.</i>

1444
01:54:05,131 --> 01:54:08,300
There's a van coming down the road.
From the north.

1445
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:20,062
Be ready for anything, now.
Wait for my signal.

1446
01:54:20,229 --> 01:54:21,856
Wait for me.

1447
01:54:27,278 --> 01:54:29,321
Get out of the van!

1448
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,782
<i>Out!</i>

1449
01:54:31,949 --> 01:54:34,118
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot me.

1450
01:54:34,285 --> 01:54:35,953
Step away.

1451
01:54:36,412 --> 01:54:38,622
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1452
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:40,958
What the hell is going on?

1453
01:54:41,125 --> 01:54:43,919
<i>– What are you doing here?</i>
– I'm delivering a package.

1454
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:45,796
I got this package for this guy, David.

1455
01:54:45,963 --> 01:54:49,258
Uh, Detective David Mills.

1456
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:58,559
Get it. Slowly.

1457
01:54:59,435 --> 01:55:01,979
<i>Stay alert. He's opening the back of the van.</i>

1458
01:55:02,146 --> 01:55:03,814
<i>We've got him in sight.</i>

1459
01:55:10,071 --> 01:55:13,324
This guy paid me 500 bucks
to bring it out here, man.

1460
01:55:13,491 --> 01:55:15,576
He said he wanted it here at exactly 7:00.

1461
01:55:16,327 --> 01:55:17,828
Put it down.

1462
01:55:18,454 --> 01:55:19,789
<i>We got a box.</i>

1463
01:55:19,955 --> 01:55:24,251
We got a box. Call the bomb squad.
I need a bomb squad. We got a box.

1464
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:26,420
Face the van.

1465
01:55:26,796 --> 01:55:28,255
Hands up.

1466
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:37,306
Turn around.

1467
01:55:38,182 --> 01:55:40,101
Okay. Go. Off you go. Go.

1468
01:55:40,267 --> 01:55:42,394
<i>Do you want us to pick this guy up?</i>

1469
01:55:43,312 --> 01:55:45,314
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1470
01:55:48,192 --> 01:55:52,154
<i>– Got the driver in sight.</i>
– He's headed north. Have him picked up.

1471
01:56:01,413 --> 01:56:03,332
Oh, I don't know.

1472
01:56:09,547 --> 01:56:11,048
I'm gonna open it.

1473
01:56:11,215 --> 01:56:15,094
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1474
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:34,822
It's blood.

1475
01:56:34,989 --> 01:56:36,740
You've made quite a life for yourself.

1476
01:56:36,907 --> 01:56:37,950
Hmm.

1477
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:41,245
– You should be very proud.
– Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1478
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:56,343
<i>Someone lost contact, copy.</i>

1479
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:10,399
California, stay away from here.

1480
01:57:10,566 --> 01:57:13,027
Stay away from here, now.
Don't come in here.

1481
01:57:13,485 --> 01:57:15,195
<i>Whatever you hear, stay away.</i>

1482
01:57:16,405 --> 01:57:19,491
John Doe has the upper hand. Mills!

1483
01:57:19,909 --> 01:57:21,035
Here he comes.

1484
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:23,078
– Throw your gun down!
– What?

1485
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:25,456
– I wish I could've lived like you.
– Shut up.

1486
01:57:25,623 --> 01:57:28,417
– What the fuck you talking about?
– Go away!

1487
01:57:28,584 --> 01:57:29,877
Do you hear me, detective?

1488
01:57:30,044 --> 01:57:34,381
I'm trying to tell you how much
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1489
01:57:35,466 --> 01:57:37,301
– What?
– Tracy.

1490
01:57:37,468 --> 01:57:38,677
Mills!

1491
01:57:38,844 --> 01:57:39,929
What'd you fucking say?

1492
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:44,183
It's disturbing how easily a member
of the press can purchase information…

1493
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:46,060
…from the men in your precinct.

1494
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,062
What the fuck?

1495
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:50,356
<i>Throw your gun down!</i>

1496
01:57:50,522 --> 01:57:52,566
I visited your home this morning…

1497
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,361
After you'd left.

1498
01:57:55,527 --> 01:57:57,655
– Mills!
– I tried to play husband.

1499
01:57:58,322 --> 01:58:01,575
I tried to taste the life of a simple man.

1500
01:58:01,784 --> 01:58:03,035
Throw it away!

1501
01:58:03,202 --> 01:58:05,496
Tsk, it didn't work out.

1502
01:58:05,663 --> 01:58:07,331
So…

1503
01:58:07,498 --> 01:58:09,416
I took a souvenir.

1504
01:58:11,043 --> 01:58:12,753
Her pretty head.

1505
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,505
Mills.

1506
01:58:15,047 --> 01:58:16,674
Mills.

1507
01:58:17,675 --> 01:58:18,842
What's he talking about?

1508
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:21,387
– Give me your gun.
– What's going on over there?

1509
01:58:21,553 --> 01:58:22,846
Put the, ugh-- Put the gun down.

1510
01:58:23,013 --> 01:58:25,015
I saw you with a box.
What was in the box?

1511
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:28,102
– Because I envy your normal life.
– Put the gun down, David.

1512
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:31,230
– It seems that envy is my sin.
– Oh, what's in the box?

1513
01:58:31,397 --> 01:58:33,732
– Not until you give me the gun.
– What's in the box?

1514
01:58:33,899 --> 01:58:35,651
– Give me the gun.
– He just told you.

1515
01:58:35,818 --> 01:58:39,446
– You lie. You're a fucking liar, shut up.
– David.

1516
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:42,366
That's what he wants.
He wants you to shoot him.

1517
01:58:42,533 --> 01:58:45,661
No! No.

1518
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,830
You tell me that's not true.

1519
01:58:47,997 --> 01:58:50,124
– That's not true.
– Become vengeance, David.

1520
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:53,168
– Oh, she's all right. You tell me.
– Become…

1521
01:58:53,335 --> 01:58:55,838
– …wrath.
– Tell me she's all right!

1522
01:58:56,005 --> 01:58:58,132
– If you murder a suspect, David--
– No.

1523
01:58:58,299 --> 01:59:00,050
You throw it all away, he knows it.

1524
01:59:00,217 --> 01:59:01,218
No!

1525
01:59:01,385 --> 01:59:03,387
– She begged for her life.
– Shut up.

1526
01:59:03,554 --> 01:59:07,224
She begged for her life
and for the life of the baby inside of her.

1527
01:59:23,282 --> 01:59:24,658
Oh.

1528
01:59:26,577 --> 01:59:27,786
He didn't know.

1529
01:59:41,759 --> 01:59:43,719
Give me the gun, David.

1530
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:50,184
David.

1531
01:59:51,477 --> 01:59:52,895
If you kill him…

1532
01:59:54,396 --> 01:59:56,148
…he will win.

1533
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:01,695
Oh, God.

1534
02:00:01,862 --> 02:00:04,073
Oh, God.

1535
02:00:04,782 --> 02:00:05,949
Oh!

1536
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:21,131
Oh, fuck, he shot him.

1537
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,823
<i>Set it down somewhere.</i>

1538
02:00:47,032 --> 02:00:49,326
<i>Come on, set us down.</i>

1539
02:00:51,745 --> 02:00:55,541
<i>Holy Christ. Somebody call somebody.</i>

1540
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:57,543
<i>Call somebody.</i>

1541
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:15,060
Well, we'll take care of him.

1542
02:01:23,735 --> 02:01:25,779
Whatever he needs.

1543
02:01:26,697 --> 02:01:28,198
Where are you gonna be?

1544
02:01:30,909 --> 02:01:32,286
Around.

1545
02:01:36,623 --> 02:01:38,542
I'll be around.

1546
02:01:42,421 --> 02:01:44,673
<i>Ernest Hemingway once wrote:</i>

1547
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:49,261
<i>«The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for.»</i>

1548
02:01:50,095 --> 02:01:52,681
<i>I agree with the second part.</i>
