1
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:40,578
Hitching at this hour!

2
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,212
You left your lights on.

3
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:20,903
Asshole!

4
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:36,257
Half a mile back and you'd be dead.

5
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:43,302
If you'd been driving,
you'd have...

6
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:47,303
No, you'd have given the bum a lift.

7
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:49,380
Sorry, darling.

8
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:58,656
Want the front seat or the back?

9
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:08,658
Why not grab some sleep?
We'll try not to disturb you.

10
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:19,860
Today's Sunday.

11
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:40,134
Trucks don't run on Sundays.

12
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,223
Very fancy.
Could be an embassy car.

13
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:50,300
Foreigners give lifts.

14
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:55,701
- You could've been diplomats.
- Or a diplomat's chauffeur on an outing.

15
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,860
I'm not blind.

16
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:04,299
Polish plates.

17
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:08,781
You don't look like
an embassy chauffeur.

18
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:12,101
There are more
privately-owned cars now.

19
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:19,654
I saw a Mercedes 190
and two Jaguars in Warsaw.

20
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:26,181
We're well over the speed limit...

21
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,613
He's an experienced driver.

22
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:34,179
Where are you headed?
We're going to the marina.

23
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:39,094
Fine.
Pity you aren't going farther.

24
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:41,740
What if I hadn't pulled up?

25
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:44,500
I'd be dead.

26
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:48,612
You do it for kicks?

27
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:50,974
Life gets boring.

28
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:54,493
How old are you?

29
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:58,094
Charged with manslaughter
for running over a puppy.

30
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:47,620
Where to?

31
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:38,100
- Just dump the bag.
- I'll bring it to you.

32
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:16,732
- Club boat?
- No, she's ours.

33
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:23,497
Well, I'll be going.

34
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:37,015
- Here a minute.
- I've a long way to go.

35
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,896
I'll tell you something.

36
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:57,623
- The bilge is full of water.
- So bail it out.

37
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,173
Give you some advice.

38
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:08,093
Don't do it again.
Some people have no reflexes.

39
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,943
That's the way I hitch.

40
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:13,703
Except some folk brake sooner.

41
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:17,173
And don't give lifts.

42
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:19,260
I meant to scare you.

43
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:23,058
You did.

44
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:28,780
Cast off, will you?

45
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:51,494
- Ever done any sailing?
- No. I walk.

46
00:10:55,144 --> 00:11:00,776
- You've got a treat in store, then.
- I like walking.

47
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:05,298
- I may try sailing someday.
- We only came for the day.

48
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,820
Me too.

49
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:18,662
- You left the windshield wipers?
- They won't get stolen around here.

50
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:31,377
- How long are you going out for?
- Just till dawn.

51
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:37,613
Can I meet you then
and hitch a ride back?

52
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,217
I thought you wanted to have a go.

53
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:45,501
- You need a hand, huh?
- We'll manage.

54
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:52,414
- You wouldn't have chickened out?
- I knew you'd pull up in time.

55
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:55,377
You're a bum,
but you're okay.

56
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:28,260
I knew you'd call me back.

57
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,854
I'm a mind reader.

58
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:36,454
- You want to go on with the game.
- You aren't in my class, kid.

59
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:40,300
But come aboard.

60
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,420
You need quick reflexes...

61
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:35,859
...and discipline.

62
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:38,976
When I was training we had a bosun.

63
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:43,939
What was his name, Krystyna?

64
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:47,462
He'd say: "Shin up that willow tree."

65
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,461
It was an oak

66
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:52,462
but we called it a willow
if he said so.

67
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:58,655
Shit.
Sorry, lots of water down there.

68
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:02,572
We'd perch in the willow
for an hour or two.

69
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:04,660
The oak, you mean.

70
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:08,139
To us it was a willow.

71
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:14,214
He'd tell us
to cuckoo like cuckoos.

72
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:16,494
Did you?

73
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:19,582
Brains weren't his strong point

74
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:23,744
but he made men out of us.

75
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:13,542
- Are we moving?
- Spit in the water.

76
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:26,340
We are moving!

77
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:35,094
- You can also dunk your foot.
- You can, but you don't.

78
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,264
This isn't Lourdes.

79
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,700
I think I forgot the salt.

80
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,300
No, I didn't.

81
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:04,498
Did you name her after your wife?

82
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:10,624
I left the cucumbers behind.

83
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:14,783
Is that your wife's name,
"Christine"?

84
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:16,860
Krystyna.

85
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,294
You haven't lost the keys?

86
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:27,300
They're on the table.

87
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:44,216
You like black radishes?

88
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:54,212
Great!
I'd never have thought of it.

89
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:58,132
Nothing like vitamins.

90
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:01,300
Here.

91
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,982
Why do you carry that murderous thing?

92
00:17:08,304 --> 00:17:11,057
A knife comes in handy.

93
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,100
Especially in the woods.

94
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:18,018
You don't need one on the water

95
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:24,458
but cutting your way
through the woods...

96
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:36,617
Sailing's easy.

97
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:43,261
It's when you hike you need a knife.

98
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:45,898
That's how it is in life.

99
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:49,140
You're a real child.

100
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:53,574
You could cut yourself.

101
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,093
Did you ever cut yourself?

102
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:01,023
Take care, you never know.

103
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:09,743
I knew a seaman once,
wanted to show off.

104
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:13,981
His pals were brighter than him.

105
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:16,664
They could tell jokes,

106
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:20,584
do card tricks.

107
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:30,383
Anyway,
he took a couple of bottles

108
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:35,532
smashed them on the floor,
took off his boots, climbed on a table...

109
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:40,494
Bored?

110
00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:42,580
Coil that warp.

111
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:46,820
Show me how it's done.

112
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:50,861
I'm at the helm,
you can't take over.

113
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,981
- I can try.
- You've got to know how.

114
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,220
It doesn't look that hard.

115
00:18:58,944 --> 00:19:00,900
Make for that buoy.

116
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:33,533
It takes brains, not brawn.

117
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:40,818
Better get back to that warp.

118
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:42,821
Who are you ordering around?

119
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:45,742
If two men are on board,
one's the skipper.

120
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:48,219
Or the drill sergeant.

121
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,180
Were you in the army?

122
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,896
University.

123
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:58,980
What are you?

124
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:04,580
A gynaecologist?

125
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,940
I write.

126
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:11,020
Like what?

127
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:14,818
Ever read the "Sporting News"?

128
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:45,860
Throw me my rucksack, please.

129
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:51,058
I'm off.

130
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:53,541
I'm a hiker, not a coolie.

131
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:55,620
You're soft.

132
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:58,941
There are 120 lakes here.
Why go this way?

133
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:02,022
Give the gentleman his rucksack.

134
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:06,342
We'll go back another way.

135
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:10,696
Without me.
I'm no sucker.

136
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:15,300
Take my place.

137
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:23,174
I wasn't talking to you.

138
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:28,455
Why don't you both get in?

139
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:38,860
12 noon.

140
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:42,054
It's ten past.

141
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:44,140
He doesn't have a watch.

142
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:28,780
Cooking something?

143
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,900
A compass.

144
00:24:46,144 --> 00:24:48,100
A big one.

145
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:51,340
No use for hiking.

146
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:11,938
You don't whistle on board.

147
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,297
Why not?

148
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:19,373
It's not done.
Seamen get mastheaded for that.

149
00:25:19,504 --> 00:25:21,460
Not hikers, though.

150
00:25:53,104 --> 00:25:55,060
Shall I cuckoo?

151
00:25:57,184 --> 00:26:00,654
- I should kick your ass!
- Let's head for shore.

152
00:26:02,064 --> 00:26:05,261
If you can reach me.

153
00:26:08,144 --> 00:26:12,456
- Does he get a gold star?
- Andrzej, please!

154
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,300
Okay, I'll take the helm.

155
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:46,575
- Where are my boots?
- Where you chucked them.

156
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:01,020
Rub some on my back.

157
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:35,340
- Sheep!
- Who?

158
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:38,700
That cloud looks like a sheep.

159
00:28:53,544 --> 00:28:55,694
The one on the left does.

160
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,380
It's breaking up.

161
00:29:05,504 --> 00:29:07,654
Going to be a storm.

162
00:29:07,784 --> 00:29:11,982
- What's that, a gut feeling?
- Time for a swim.

163
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,260
We aren't moving.

164
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:26,980
The wind's dropped.

165
00:29:28,904 --> 00:29:30,860
What now?

166
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:35,543
Lunch.
That's a gut feeling.

167
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:07,774
No finger bowls?

168
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,380
That gadget your invention?

169
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:57,179
You don't think it's necessary?

170
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,540
Try it without.

171
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,420
You spilled the soup.

172
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:41,260
Sit down.

173
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,300
Not eating?

174
00:32:13,784 --> 00:32:16,423
I want to get off.

175
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,500
You can paddle ashore.

176
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:24,461
It's in the fo'c'sle.

177
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:26,540
We're having lunch now.

178
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:30,902
Sailing's for grown-ups.

179
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:34,334
You wait for the wind.

180
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:36,420
A waste of time.

181
00:32:38,104 --> 00:32:41,858
- What would you do?
- Walk.

182
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,260
You walk for walking's sake.

183
00:32:46,784 --> 00:32:49,901
Stop being silly and eat.

184
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:43,301
Steer for the shore.

185
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:47,019
- Was that an order?
- It was. Change course.

186
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:49,658
I want to land.

187
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:54,096
- There's land all around.
- This side's nearer.

188
00:33:54,224 --> 00:33:55,293
And shallower.

189
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:58,541
So?
We'll run aground paddling?

190
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:02,213
Come on.
We'll find a way through.

191
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:25,614
- Why did he climb on the table?
- Who?

192
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:31,137
The bosun who smashed the bottles.

193
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:34,017
He was a seaman,
not a bosun.

194
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:41,699
He jumped on the broken glass.
Blood spurted everywhere.

195
00:34:41,824 --> 00:34:43,780
Tough guy.

196
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,662
Take your bib off.

197
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:55,055
Jump!

198
00:35:55,184 --> 00:35:58,335
- Go get that paddle!
- I can't swim.

199
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:00,659
You want me to drown?

200
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,740
Jump, I said!

201
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:26,980
Give me the crocodile.

202
00:37:00,624 --> 00:37:02,535
You'll ruin the deck.

203
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:05,224
I've got a delicate touch.

204
00:37:09,064 --> 00:37:13,501
You'd swim if you fell in.

205
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:16,500
You try.

206
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:24,220
I'm only kidding.

207
00:37:57,424 --> 00:38:01,497
There's a first-aid kit below.
Go dress those burns.

208
00:38:03,344 --> 00:38:05,300
Need help?

209
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:43,300
Let it go!

210
00:42:35,984 --> 00:42:37,861
You were rattled.

211
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:42,216
I didn't know where the wind was.

212
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:44,935
Next time check those telltales.

213
00:42:49,344 --> 00:42:51,778
Want to try balancing her?

214
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:54,577
Show us what you're made of.

215
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:58,014
- Lean over the side, you mean?
- Yes.

216
00:42:58,144 --> 00:42:59,816
It takes guts.

217
00:43:12,784 --> 00:43:14,900
We're sailing!

218
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,696
Sure, for sailing's sake.

219
00:43:18,104 --> 00:43:20,743
Or walking's sake!

220
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:26,060
Knife!

221
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,741
I said it was shallow.

222
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,820
You had the helm.

223
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:00,815
Let's push her off.

224
00:46:00,944 --> 00:46:02,900
The wind's dropped.

225
00:46:40,504 --> 00:46:42,460
It's quite deep there.

226
00:46:43,744 --> 00:46:45,700
Hand me the oar.

227
00:49:05,104 --> 00:49:07,060
Don't look.

228
00:49:39,464 --> 00:49:42,501
Pass us some cups.

229
00:49:48,464 --> 00:49:50,102
Medicine.

230
00:49:56,864 --> 00:49:58,820
To those at sea.

231
00:50:04,824 --> 00:50:06,780
Let's blow up the mattresses.

232
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:20,140
See who does it first.

233
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,579
Some asshole they've sent to Ankara!

234
00:51:01,704 --> 00:51:05,014
- Our best middleweight.
- I meant the commentator.

235
00:51:05,144 --> 00:51:08,500
Do you play bridge?
Pity.

236
00:51:09,184 --> 00:51:11,823
- No cards?
- No fourth.

237
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:15,903
- We could play with a dummy.
- No dummies on this boat.

238
00:51:38,104 --> 00:51:40,060
Here are the real ones.

239
00:51:47,664 --> 00:51:50,542
- You start.
- I don't know the game.

240
00:51:53,624 --> 00:51:54,773
Come on, get on with it.

241
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:03,177
The loser pays a forfeit.

242
00:52:11,744 --> 00:52:13,700
You mustn't move the others, right?

243
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:22,900
It's quite simple.

244
00:52:33,544 --> 00:52:35,500
You moved one.

245
00:52:37,184 --> 00:52:39,140
A forfeit.

246
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:51,020
Thank you.

247
00:53:03,704 --> 00:53:07,253
Use that delicate touch.

248
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,460
That one was safe.

249
00:53:53,304 --> 00:53:55,260
My forfeit.

250
00:54:22,464 --> 00:54:25,456
What's the price of this forfeit?

251
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:31,973
What's the price of this forfeit?

252
00:54:32,104 --> 00:54:34,060
A song.

253
00:54:36,264 --> 00:54:38,220
Lucky it's your forfeit.

254
00:54:40,064 --> 00:54:42,419
Show him what a nice voice you have.

255
00:54:42,544 --> 00:54:44,500
Sing that song you were humming.

256
00:54:49,384 --> 00:54:54,139
Guest's request.
You're outvoted, skipper.

257
00:54:58,344 --> 00:55:01,973
- Suit yourself.
- No, listen to your fight.

258
00:55:29,504 --> 00:55:31,460
I can't.

259
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:33,901
I'm not in the mood.

260
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:35,980
You won't get your forfeit.

261
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:44,982
Say no more no more

262
00:55:45,104 --> 00:55:50,815
Don't look that way
Let me go

263
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:56,462
We're out of woods
And moons and stars

264
00:55:56,584 --> 00:56:01,783
There's no tenderness in us

265
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:07,024
Don't lie anymore
don't beg

266
00:56:07,144 --> 00:56:12,616
You know there's nothing left

267
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:17,613
Though life is empty
You don't need me

268
00:56:17,744 --> 00:56:23,819
Joy has faded
and our love's gone sour

269
00:56:50,104 --> 00:56:51,856
I've forgotten the rest.

270
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:54,339
Stupid song.

271
00:56:54,464 --> 00:56:56,420
I wonder who KO'd Molik?

272
00:57:00,024 --> 00:57:02,174
What's the price of this forfeit?

273
00:57:02,304 --> 00:57:04,260
A poem.

274
00:57:14,824 --> 00:57:16,780
How did he get KO'd?

275
00:57:17,984 --> 00:57:21,499
Night
The oil in my lamp is low

276
00:57:21,624 --> 00:57:24,092
Mosquitoes whine about me

277
00:57:24,224 --> 00:57:27,500
That handful of stars above

279
00:57:30,624 --> 00:57:33,422
Are you the white sail on the lake

280
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,017
Or the waves that lap the shoe?

281
00:57:37,144 --> 00:57:41,581
Have you strewn
my pages with Stardust?

282
00:57:59,064 --> 00:58:02,215
Excellent memory.

283
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:04,300
You can turn on the radio.

284
00:58:09,584 --> 00:58:11,540
That's how it's done.

285
00:58:11,664 --> 00:58:15,179
I knew a guy who could beat me.

286
00:58:15,304 --> 00:58:17,977
A genius at the game.

287
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,540
Name of Mayzner.

288
00:58:24,664 --> 00:58:29,021
Had a big boat, 12 metres.

289
00:58:30,024 --> 00:58:35,974
He was good.
A qualified skipper.

290
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:40,335
Forged his papers,
got caught.

291
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:43,774
Still, he was okay.

292
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:45,860
He'd say:

293
00:58:49,144 --> 00:58:54,059
jackstraws isn't just a game.

294
00:58:54,184 --> 00:58:57,859
It's a living organism.

295
00:59:00,344 --> 00:59:04,223
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

296
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:06,300
He's fast asleep.

297
00:59:08,104 --> 00:59:09,537
Must be tired.

298
00:59:09,664 --> 00:59:11,620
He probably slept rough last night.

299
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:18,098
- Why did you take him along?
- He may be shamming.

300
00:59:20,344 --> 00:59:24,496
- What time shall I set it for?
- 5 A.M.

301
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:28,780
I've got a meeting at 9.

302
01:00:37,162 --> 01:00:39,118
I heard you go on deck.

303
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:43,237
You weren't asleep?

304
01:00:43,362 --> 01:00:45,318
I'm a light sleeper.

305
01:00:57,642 --> 01:00:59,598
I couldn't sleep either.

306
01:01:04,362 --> 01:01:06,318
It's stuffy.

307
01:01:16,122 --> 01:01:18,078
The rain didn't help any.

308
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:30,118
When do we get going?

309
01:01:31,002 --> 01:01:34,551
We cut the halyard.
Got to mend it.

310
01:01:36,322 --> 01:01:38,278
The bilge needs emptying.

311
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,718
Get some sleep.

312
01:01:42,882 --> 01:01:44,838
Shall I bail out?

313
01:03:50,802 --> 01:03:54,192
Early birds, huh?
5 A.M., we said.

314
01:03:54,322 --> 01:03:56,552
We're fixing the halyard.

315
01:03:56,682 --> 01:03:58,001
I didn't sleep a wink.

316
01:03:58,122 --> 01:04:01,592
What should I do with this thing?

317
01:04:03,522 --> 01:04:05,478
Take the helm.

318
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:12,118
Get the anchor up.

319
01:04:26,002 --> 01:04:27,958
Stow it in the fo'c'sle.

320
01:04:35,322 --> 01:04:37,472
Get down there.

321
01:04:37,602 --> 01:04:39,558
What for?

322
01:04:39,682 --> 01:04:42,640
Get in the fo'c'sle.

323
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,718
You'll find a box there.

324
01:04:51,842 --> 01:04:54,959
We'll be ashore soon.
Stop acting the skipper.

325
01:04:55,082 --> 01:04:57,038
There's a rag in the box.

326
01:04:59,802 --> 01:05:01,758
Got it?

327
01:05:06,162 --> 01:05:09,996
That's not all.
The bucket too.

328
01:05:16,602 --> 01:05:19,196
- I want that deck swabbed.
- Can't I do it?

329
01:05:19,322 --> 01:05:21,278
Stay at the helm.

330
01:05:44,962 --> 01:05:47,681
Been an instructive trip, huh?

331
01:05:54,682 --> 01:05:58,152
Nice to make new friends.

332
01:07:02,202 --> 01:07:05,160
- Say something nice to him.
- Just make for that buoy.

333
01:07:14,842 --> 01:07:16,798
Where's my knife?

334
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:22,999
What happened to my knife?

335
01:07:27,642 --> 01:07:31,681
Easy, nothing gets lost on this boat.

336
01:07:32,922 --> 01:07:36,801
I didn't say it was lost.
Where is it?

337
01:07:37,402 --> 01:07:39,552
In my pocket.

338
01:07:41,082 --> 01:07:43,118
Why did you take it?

339
01:07:43,242 --> 01:07:45,676
Think I was scared of you?

340
01:07:46,722 --> 01:07:51,238
I don't need a knife to handle myself.

341
01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:53,318
I want it back.

342
01:07:55,042 --> 01:07:57,158
Come and get it.

343
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:05,238
Give me back my knife.

344
01:08:19,202 --> 01:08:21,158
Jump!

345
01:09:05,082 --> 01:09:06,231
He'll drown!

346
01:09:08,322 --> 01:09:10,278
He hasn't come up.

347
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:16,154
Don't worry, he can swim.

348
01:09:17,682 --> 01:09:19,638
- He said he...
- He was lying.

349
01:09:40,962 --> 01:09:42,918
Farther to the right!

350
01:09:44,922 --> 01:09:46,878
To the right!
There!

351
01:10:04,122 --> 01:10:06,192
He must be clinging to the buoy.

352
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,755
- No sign of him.
- Check the other side.

353
01:10:29,202 --> 01:10:30,681
Nothing!

354
01:11:22,682 --> 01:11:24,638
You've drowned him!

355
01:11:34,402 --> 01:11:36,438
What was his name?

356
01:11:36,562 --> 01:11:39,315
- He's got to come up.
- He couldn't swim.

357
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:41,592
He didn't even take a dip.

358
01:11:43,322 --> 01:11:46,314
- How deep is it here?
- 20-30 feet.

359
01:11:46,442 --> 01:11:48,558
Deeper.

360
01:11:48,682 --> 01:11:51,116
Dive again.
Call the police.

361
01:11:51,242 --> 01:11:53,710
Much good that would do.

362
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:57,278
See, you admit it!
You've drowned him!

363
01:12:00,122 --> 01:12:01,555
Stop yelling!

364
01:12:21,562 --> 01:12:23,632
Murderer!

365
01:12:23,762 --> 01:12:25,593
You're scared!

366
01:12:25,722 --> 01:12:29,032
Lost your nerve. Tough guy!

367
01:12:29,162 --> 01:12:31,801
Phoney! Clown!

368
01:12:33,362 --> 01:12:37,753
You only took him along to show off!

369
01:12:39,122 --> 01:12:40,760
What d'you think you look like?

370
01:12:40,882 --> 01:12:43,396
- Like your wife.
- Without me you'd be a whore!

371
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,714
I hate you!

372
01:12:47,842 --> 01:12:49,514
Push off, then!

373
01:12:50,642 --> 01:12:54,351
- I'm sick of you!
- Push off yourself!

374
01:12:55,402 --> 01:12:57,870
You think I'm scared of the police?

375
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:01,958
You make me vomit!

376
01:13:15,322 --> 01:13:19,952
Still showing off.
You'll be back.

377
01:15:09,002 --> 01:15:10,958
So you can swim!

378
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:20,319
I didn't hear you.
My teeth were chattering.

379
01:15:20,442 --> 01:15:23,354
Come back!

380
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:25,677
Let's try together.

381
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:43,598
Get yourself a brandy.

382
01:15:44,522 --> 01:15:46,672
Where's my rucksack?
I'll swim ashore.

383
01:15:51,002 --> 01:15:52,958
I honestly didn't hear.

384
01:16:00,042 --> 01:16:03,432
If I'd known it would come to this,
I wouldn't have hidden.

385
01:16:08,842 --> 01:16:10,798
You're just like him

386
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:16,314
only half his age and twice as dumb.

387
01:16:16,442 --> 01:16:21,470
What do you know about life?
Just cafes, yachts and cars.

388
01:16:21,602 --> 01:16:24,036
Bet you've got a four-room apartment.

389
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:31,358
- I suppose you live 4 students to a room.
- 6, actually.

390
01:16:31,482 --> 01:16:33,438
I've been through it myself.

391
01:16:34,282 --> 01:16:36,238
So has he.

392
01:16:39,402 --> 01:16:41,358
You're no better than him.

393
01:16:42,522 --> 01:16:44,478
He was just like you.

394
01:16:45,962 --> 01:16:48,999
And you want to be like him.
And you will be,

395
01:16:49,122 --> 01:16:51,078
if you've got the guts.

396
01:16:53,762 --> 01:16:57,550
6 to a room.
You want to sleep, they play cards.

397
01:16:57,682 --> 01:16:59,877
You want to study,
they douse the lights.

398
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:05,034
Canteen lunches, cheap smokes.

399
01:17:06,402 --> 01:17:09,235
Kissing in the alley

400
01:17:09,362 --> 01:17:11,922
fingers so cold
you can't unbutton her blouse.

401
01:17:15,722 --> 01:17:18,634
Did I leave anything out?

402
01:17:18,762 --> 01:17:22,550
Parents dead, sister got TB?

403
01:17:22,682 --> 01:17:24,638
No...

404
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,678
They're alive?

405
01:17:28,802 --> 01:17:31,600
Divorced. Both remarried.

406
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:34,478
Any brothers or sisters?

407
01:17:38,402 --> 01:17:40,518
Your parents help you?

408
01:17:40,642 --> 01:17:42,598
Father does sometimes.

409
01:17:48,682 --> 01:17:51,515
Here.
You'll catch cold.

410
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:38,798
You're just a child.

411
01:19:11,962 --> 01:19:13,554
I'm sorry.

412
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,638
Don't be silly.

413
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:56,919
It's Monday.

414
01:20:57,042 --> 01:20:59,556
Will there be any trucks?

415
01:20:59,682 --> 01:21:03,311
Plenty. Food trucks.

416
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:06,002
Monday's the best day.

417
01:21:10,762 --> 01:21:13,151
Ready?

418
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:15,796
Fend off?

419
01:21:15,922 --> 01:21:17,594
Yes.

420
01:21:21,762 --> 01:21:24,515
Aye, aye. Fend off.

421
01:25:16,322 --> 01:25:18,233
The wipers are gone.

422
01:25:18,362 --> 01:25:20,193
Didn't you hear me calling?

423
01:25:20,322 --> 01:25:22,278
When?

424
01:25:29,722 --> 01:25:31,678
I shouted.

425
01:25:40,282 --> 01:25:43,831
- Did you go to the police?
- Naked?

426
01:25:43,962 --> 01:25:46,556
I didn't have the car keys.

427
01:25:46,682 --> 01:25:48,638
You could have smashed a window.

428
01:25:50,962 --> 01:25:53,760
- Are we going home?
- No, to the police.

429
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,838
About the wipers?

430
01:26:28,322 --> 01:26:30,278
Scared?

431
01:26:35,002 --> 01:26:36,230
No...

432
01:26:36,362 --> 01:26:38,592
- You are.
- I'm not.

433
01:26:39,882 --> 01:26:41,838
Aren't you?

434
01:26:43,922 --> 01:26:45,196
Yes.

435
01:26:45,322 --> 01:26:49,076
Don't go.
It's enough you're scared.

436
01:26:49,202 --> 01:26:51,158
You weren't responsible.

437
01:26:55,362 --> 01:26:59,321
He was behind the buoy.
He dived when I checked.

438
01:27:00,562 --> 01:27:04,032
You were gone when he showed up.
We shouted.

439
01:27:04,162 --> 01:27:07,234
How could I hear anything?

440
01:27:08,202 --> 01:27:10,158
It's all nonsense.

441
01:27:11,682 --> 01:27:16,233
You're making it up.
You think you can save my neck.

442
01:27:18,082 --> 01:27:21,154
You tell me a pack of lies.
I pretend to believe them

443
01:27:21,282 --> 01:27:24,399
then we read in the paper:

444
01:27:25,602 --> 01:27:28,958
"19-year-old Youth Missing."

445
01:27:30,322 --> 01:27:32,278
And we'll feel sick.

446
01:27:33,762 --> 01:27:37,118
You're the one who's making it up.

447
01:27:37,242 --> 01:27:41,201
I checked that buoy.
He wasn't there.

448
01:27:42,762 --> 01:27:45,913
He's alive.
So much so, I cheated on you with him.

449
01:27:46,842 --> 01:27:49,914
I'm not scared, you are

450
01:27:50,042 --> 01:27:53,114
so much so, you're fantasising.

451
01:28:07,402 --> 01:28:10,360
POLICE STATION 5km

452
01:28:23,322 --> 01:28:28,396
By the way,
you never finished that story.

453
01:28:29,562 --> 01:28:31,234
Why have we stopped?

454
01:28:31,362 --> 01:28:38,200
I'd like to believe you,
but cheat on me with him? Bad joke.

455
01:28:38,762 --> 01:28:40,957
Sorry, I won't tell it again.

456
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:43,038
It was all my fault...

457
01:28:43,162 --> 01:28:46,438
Why did that seaman
jump on broken glass?

458
01:28:48,602 --> 01:28:50,638
You didn't finish your story.

459
01:28:50,762 --> 01:28:52,320
What is it with you?

460
01:28:59,882 --> 01:29:01,759
Where are we going?

461
01:29:01,882 --> 01:29:03,838
He got overconfident.

462
01:29:06,402 --> 01:29:09,314
Did the trick once too often.

463
01:29:09,442 --> 01:29:15,392
He was a stoker.
Hard soles from walking on coke.

464
01:29:17,322 --> 01:29:21,110
Been ashore a year.
His feet had gone soft.

465
01:29:21,242 --> 01:29:23,472
He didn't realise.

466
01:29:23,602 --> 01:29:27,436
- Did he ever try it again?
- No idea what became of him.
