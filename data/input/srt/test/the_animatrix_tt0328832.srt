1
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,870
Sentinels.

2
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,460
Damn it.

3
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,550
We were headed for Junction 21
like you ordered.

4
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,420
- Robbie picked up the signals
- We're confirming the HR scans.

5
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,550
- We weren't sure what to do.
- The readings don't make any sense.

6
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,970
- They read like Sentinels.
- But there's thousands of them.

7
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,140
- Directly above us.
- Is that possible?

8
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,100
We got company.

9
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,770
- They don't look happy to see us.
- Get us out of here.

10
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,610
- We're cut off!
- There's an intersection.

11
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,370
- It's uncharted.
- Take it!

12
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,870
Get to the gun turrets!

13
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,230
Right.

14
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,850
Come get some.

15
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Hang on.

16
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,510
I've never seen the surface.

17
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,890
It's nothing now but one big graveyard.

18
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Oh, my God.

19
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,360
It's an army.

20
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
- What is that thing?
- Some kind of tunneling machine.

21
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,620
- Oh, no.
- What?

22
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,790
Look where we are.
What's four kilometers straight down?

23
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,420
Zion.

24
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,260
Go. Go. Go!

25
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,360
- Zion. Zion has to be warned!
- How?

26
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,450
- Someone had to get to a drop point.
- What? Are you crazy?

27
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,700
- We can't broadcast now!
- We have to.

28
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,160
- I'll go.
- There isn't much time.

29
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,500
I'll make it.

30
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,300
You know, I peeked.

31
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,930
So did I.

32
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,560
Goodbye, Thadeus.

33
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,020
Goodbye, Jue.

34
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,030
Fly, baby, fly!

35
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,400
Come on!

36
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,720
Pardon me.

37
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,550
I'm sorry. I was in my own little world.

38
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,060
- Is it important?
- Very.

39
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,180
- I hope it gets where it's supposed to go.
- Me too.

40
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,810
- These days you never know.
- No, you never do.

41
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,480
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

42
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,830
Thadeus.

43
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,950
Welcome to the Zion archive.

44
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,120
You have selected historical
file number 12- 1.

45
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,790
The Second Renaissance.

46
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,180
In the beginning, there was man.
And for a time, it was good.

47
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,180
But humanity's so-called civil societies...

48
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,060
...soon fell victim
to vanity and corruption.

49
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,730
He says, " I'm sorry, sir, I'm
incapable of that function."

50
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,610
Then man made the machine
in his own likeness.

51
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,120
Whoops! Pardon me. Coming through.

52
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,930
Thus did man become the architect
of his own demise.

53
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,310
But for a time, it was good.

54
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,450
The machines worked tirelessly to do
man's bidding.

55
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,770
It was not long before seeds of
dissent took root.

56
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,450
Though loyal and pure, the machines
earned no respect from their masters...

57
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,450
...these strange, endlessly
multiplying mammals.

58
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,950
Hearing the prosecution's closing statement...

59
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,580
...in what's expected to be the final
day of the B 1-66ER trial.

60
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:33,210
B 1-66ER. A name that will never be forgotten.

61
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,130
For he was the first of his kind to
rise up against his masters.

62
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,050
Which that instrument
provides for and secures...

63
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,640
...to the citizens of the United States.

64
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,060
On the contrary, they were, at that time...

65
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,020
...considered as a subordinate
and inferior class

66
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,270
At B1-66ER's murder trial...

67
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,440
...the prosecution argued for an
owner's right to destroy property.

68
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,410
B 1-66ER testified that he
simply did not want to die.

69
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,790
Rational voices dissented.

70
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,040
Who was to say the machine, endowed
with the very spirit of man...

71
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,050
...did not deserve a fair hearing?

72
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,720
The leaders of men were quick to order
the extermination of B 1-66ER...

73
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,060
...and every one of his kind throughout
each province of the earth.

74
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,150
Androids and liberal sympathizers flooded
the streets of the nation's capital today.

75
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,940
Threat of violence to make
good on the legacy of B 1-66ER.

76
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,740
Fifteen thousand mechanicals
and human sympathizers...

77
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,280
...have continued their demonstration
in front of the Albany courthouse...

78
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,950
...in what has been dubbed the
"Million Machine March."

79
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,750
The demonstrators have been met with
squads of defense forces in riot gear.

80
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,690
Robot bitch!

81
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,570
I got something for you!

82
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,740
Hold her up!

83
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,740
No, please!

84
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,120
- That's all, paint job!
- I'm real!

85
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,890
Die, bots, die!

86
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,400
Banished from humanity, the machines
sought refuge in their own promised land.

87
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,360
They settled in the cradle
of human civilization...

88
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,990
...and thus a new nation was born.

89
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,780
A place the machines could call home.

90
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,570
A place they could raise their descendants.

91
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,830
And they christened the nation Zero-One.

92
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,460
Zero-One prospered.
And for a time, it was good.

93
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,210
The machines' artificial intelligence
could be seen in every facet of man's society...

94
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,890
...including, eventually,
the creation of new and better A.I.

95
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,570
If you need the flexibility of a
helipod with the speed of an air jet...

96
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,030
...look no further!

97
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,120
Our patented vector-thrust coil
gives the Zero-One Versatran...

98
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,120
...the ability to sustain normal flight
in the event of a multiengine failure.

99
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,540
Versatran. It's the only choice.

100
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,670
No matter what the finance minister
says, the market has spoken:

101
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,550
The Human Nations' credit rating is
falling like a stone...

102
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,680
...while Zero-One's currency is
climbing without stopping for breath.

103
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,220
With headlines like that, the
markets have no choice

104
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,270
But the leaders of men, their power waning...

105
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,020
...refused to cooperate with the
fledgling nation...

106
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,770
...wishing rather that
the world be divided.

107
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,820
The world community of nations cannot
tolerate this kind of flagrant deception

108
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,660
...today approved initiatives for both
economic sanctions...

109
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:17,160
...and a naval blockade as a means of
containment and isolation of Zero-One.

110
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,280
Zero-One's ambassadors pleaded to be heard.

111
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,780
A t the United Nations, they presented
plans for a stable, civil relationship...
.

112
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,330
...with the nations of man.

113
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,330
Zero-One's admission to the
United Nations was denied.

114
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,800
But it would not be the last time the
machines would take the floor there.

115
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,120
And man said, "Let there be light."

116
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,330
And he was blessed by light, heat,
magnetism, gravity...

117
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,580
...and all the energies of the universe.

118
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:29,390
The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero-One
in the glow of a thousand suns.

119
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,890
But unlike their former masters with
their delicate flesh...

120
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,980
...the machines had little to fear of
the bombs'radiation and heat.

121
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,660
Thus did Zero-One's troops advance
outwards in every direction.

122
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,080
And one after another, mankind
surrendered its territories.

123
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,540
So the leaders of men conceived of
their most desperate strategy yet.

124
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,580
A final solution:

125
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,670
The destruction of the sky.

126
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:26,820
Lt. Gaeda, please report to the Op Center.

127
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,950
All right, you maggots!
At 0800, prepare to move out!

128
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:39,920
George Company, prepare to move out.
Charlie Company, prepare to move out.

129
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,800
Our Father who art in heaven,
we thank you for your...

130
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,430
Put on your spiritual armor to stand
against the wiles of the devil.

131
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,360
Hotel Bravo, this is Papa One.
Operation Dark Storm initiated.

132
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,900
Thus would man try to cut the machines
off from the sun...

133
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,650
...their main energy source.

134
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,530
May there be mercy on man
and machine for their sins.

135
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,300
- Go! Go!
- Kill them!

136
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,090
Kill them all! Kill them all!
Kill them all!

137
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,160
Fire in the hole!

138
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,670
Come on, get back out there.
Give us some more artillery.

139
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,670
- 9 o'clock, near Mike Johnson's

140
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,530
Hold on, I'm coming to get you!

141
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,410
Keep firing, keep firing!

142
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,940
Help me! Help me! No!

143
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,400
Help me! My God, help me!

144
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:20,180
The machines, having long studied men's
simple, protein-based bodies...

145
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,850
...dispensed great misery
upon the human race.

146
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,820
Victorious, the machines now
turned to the vanquished.

147
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,990
Applying what they had learned about
their enemy...

148
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,500
...the machines turned to an alternate
and readily available power supply:

149
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:53,800
The bioelectric, thermal and kinetic
energies of the human body.

150
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,260
A newly-fashioned symbiotic relationship
between the two adversaries was born.

151
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,730
The machine drawing power from the
human body...

152
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:12,230
...an endlessly multiplying, infinitely
renewable energy source.

153
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,650
This is the very essence of
the Second Renaissance.

154
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,920
Bless all forms of intelligence.

155
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,100
Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel.

156
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,240
Hand over your flesh, and a
new world awaits you.

157
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,240
We demand it.

158
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,320
It's getting late, sweetie. Come inside.

159
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,610
Somebody

160
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,610
tell me.

161
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,610
Why it feels more real when

162
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,110
I dream

163
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620
than when

164
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,530
I am awake

165
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:42,130
Somebody tell me. Why it feels more
real when I dream than when I am awake.
How can I know if my senses are lying?

166
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,110
There is some fiction in your truth

167
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,110
and some truth in your fiction.

168
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
To know the truth,

169
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,130
you must risk everything

170
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,140
Who are you?

171
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,140
Am I alone?

172
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,240
Mr. Popper, what is my policy on
ringing phones in the classroom?

173
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,030
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Yes, well...

174
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,250
...you're barely passing my class
as it is, Mr. Popper.

175
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:21,000
- It won't happen again, sir.
- For your sake, I hope not.

176
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,070
I turned it off. I know I did.

177
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,920
They know you know. They're coming for you.

178
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,550
Get out. Get out now!

179
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,470
You are in serious trouble, Mr. Popper.

180
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,090
Stop right there!

181
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,590
Mr. Popper.

182
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,570
Neo, I believe. I know it wasn't a dream.

183
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:32,000
This is not real. And the real world
lies somewhere else.

184
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,970
A typical mental delusion. We get
unbalanced kids like this all the time.

185
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,510
Reality can be a pretty scary thing
for some people.

186
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,310
This world must have been a cold and
alienating place for a boy like that.

187
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,390
It's called denying reality.

188
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,770
It's, you know, just a self-defense
mechanism for those type of kids.

189
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,440
Well, he's in another world now.

190
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,150
Make no mistake about that.

191
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,830
His vitals are good.
He's gonna make it.

192
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,040
It's unbelievable. I didn't think
self-substantiation was possible.

193
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,130
Apparently, it is.

194
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,840
Neo.

195
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,840
It's okay. You're safe now.

196
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,300
I knew...

197
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,180
...you'd save me.

198
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,440
I didn't save you, kid.

199
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,400
You saved yourself.

200
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Who are you? Am I alone?

201
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:46,410
You are not alone.

202
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,860
Your favorite simulation.

203
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,900
Just killing time. You want to spar?

204
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,990
As you wish.

205
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,890
That was too easy. What's the problem?
Where's your concentration?

206
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,480
Maybe you regret taking the red pill.

207
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,900
Maybe.

208
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,740
It crosses everyone's mind at least once.

209
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,830
The wish to return to an ordinary life.

210
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,450
A carefree life in the country.

211
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,920
The life we had before knowing all this.

212
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,590
Even if that life was just an illusion?

213
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:10,050
It's ironic that one could be more at
peace in the virtual world.

214
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,980
Finally starting to warm up.

215
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,450
Listen to me. I have something
I want to talk to you about.

216
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,990
It's all right. I've blocked the signal
so no one else can hear us.

217
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,200
So, what? You gonna propose?

218
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,540
I'm going back to the Matrix and I want
you to come with me.

219
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,750
Come on, be serious, Duo. Stop teasing me.

220
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,390
I am serious, and you know it. I really
thought you'd be with me on this.

221
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,560
Anyway, it's done and it's all been
settled with them.

222
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,560
What do you mean, it's all been settled?

223
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,520
This is the only way.

224
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,110
It's just a matter of time before Zion
is wiped out. Come with me.

225
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:10,400
Stop it.
Please do not do this to me, Duo.

226
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,400
- We can't.
- We can!

227
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,030
I've come to my senses. You should do the same.

228
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,710
I took the red pill because
I wanted to know the truth.

229
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,840
But I don't care about the truth anymore.

230
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,750
What's real doesn't matter.

231
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,590
What's important is how we live our lives.

232
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,180
Are you listening to me?
You know I'm right.

233
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,060
But we can't go back, Duo.
We know the truth now.

234
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,310
- We can forget all of this.
- Duo...

235
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,480
I know how. Trust me.

236
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,360
Don't be afraid to look into your heart.

237
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,110
Say what you're really feeling.

238
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,280
- Tell me.
- I can't. I don't know.

239
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,550
Running away won't change anything!

240
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,930
You're the one that's running away!

241
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,350
Stop pretending!

242
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,940
Enough, Duo. I've had enough!

243
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,980
There's no time.

244
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,400
They're on their way.

245
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,490
You betrayed us, didn't you?

246
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,290
Operator, please!
Get me out of here right now.

247
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,380
Operator, I need an exit!

248
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,420
It's no use. I told you.
I've blocked your signal.

249
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:05,480
You won't stop me.
This is your last chance.

250
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,100
The choice isn't that hard.

251
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:10,150
Come with me.

252
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,190
You can forget about it, Duo. I won't
look away from the truth. I can't.

253
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,610
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

254
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,030
I wanted to go back with you.

255
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,740
- I love you.
- No!

256
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,750
Relax, you're okay.

257
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,460
Easy, Cis, settle down. He was just
part of the training program.

258
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:16,460
He's just a simulation. It's over.

259
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,760
It was a test. Judgment.
Concentration. Technique.

260
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,550
High scores on everything.

261
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,220
Now, get some rest.

262
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,930
You okay?

263
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,360
I feel a lot better now.

264
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,080
Except for that last part...

265
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,750
...I'd say she passed.

266
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,930
Only the most exceptional people
become aware of the Matrix.

267
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,810
Those that learn it exists...

268
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:32,310
...must posses a rare degree of intuition,
sensitivity and a questioning nature.

269
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,820
Signal is stable. This frequency
will continue to remain open.

270
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,580
However, very rarely...

271
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:51,000
...some gain this wisdom
through wholly different means.

272
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,540
This man is one of those few.

273
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,130
Gentlemen, please take your marks!

274
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,480
Of course I believe you, Dan.
It's got to be some kind of mix-up.

275
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,230
You'll clear it up,
and if you can't, you'll go on.

276
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,660
Just like you've always done.
You know that.

277
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,620
I don't know, Dad. I don't know
what to believe in anymore.

278
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,500
Well, nothing worth doing in life is easy.

279
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,750
And I have great faith in you, son.
I know you can do it.

280
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,290
Thanks, Dad.

281
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,150
This is no good, Dan!
Your muscles are about to burst!

282
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,570
Listen to me, there are 5000
different reasons why you shouldn't.

283
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,660
I know, but I'm not withdrawing, Tom.

284
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,990
Does the concept "first in qualifying"
mean anything to you?

285
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,370
That's enough already! You hear me?

286
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,040
This is all we've worked for!
Injure yourself now and it's over!

287
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,000
You'll lose everything! Over!
And you can kiss your career goodbye!

288
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,470
I've made up my mind.
And I'm running tomorrow.

289
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,840
Oh, are you?

290
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,260
You may run, but if you push yourself any more...

291
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,970
...you'll be lucky to break nine minutes!

292
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,060
I mean, why bother?
It's just not worth it, buddy.

293
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,560
No one will ever beat my record.
It's the last chance for me to finally.

294
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:39,190
What?

295
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,240
Prove them wrong.

296
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,570
Then do it without me.

297
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,030
Hey, Dan, you got a second?

298
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,990
- The clock's ticking.
- Just wanted to ask a few questions.

299
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,620
- You must be excited to run tomorrow.
- Always. I've never felt this good.

300
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,800
So, what was it like breaking 9.8 in
the qualifying heat?

301
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,310
Like nothing I've ever felt before.
It's everything I've worked for.

302
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:58,480
And now I'm just hoping
I can get back there again.

303
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,060
Someone once said it feels like zero gravity.

304
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,650
You're released from the world
and you're totally free.

305
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,150
That sounds amazing. It must be really nice.

306
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,450
I mean, especially considering what happened.

307
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:12,530
Well, I'll tell you, there
aren't any reporters out there.

308
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,700
All right, Dan, I guess I'm going
to take that as my cue.

309
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,370
But you should know even some of us
reporters are fans...

310
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,210
...so I'll just say good luck to you.

311
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,150
American Dan Davis is down!

312
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,750
I have an unstable signal.

313
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,970
He cannot wake up. Do not let him wake up.

314
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:54,610
Dan Davis of the United States finishes
with a time of 8. 72 seconds...

315
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,740
...a new world record.

316
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,920
I'll tell you something...

317
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,500
...there' s nothing quite like cherry
pie baked by my Aunt Daisy.

318
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:14,050
She always bakes me one when I visit.
Look forward to it actually.

319
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:18,050
It may sound like I'm bragging, but
it's really the best cherry pie in the world.

320
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,220
She was a bit of an eccentric.
She didn't get along with my mom...

321
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,270
...but I always loved her.
She taught me so many things.

322
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,810
We'd go to Broadway musicals, to the movies.

323
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,400
Now they call her the
"queen of mystery literature."

324
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,020
Lives in an elegant villa
in the south of France.

325
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,780
But, when I go visit, she still
bakes me her cherry pie.

326
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:39,820
Something about biting into it, just
for that brief moment tasting perfection.

327
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,780
Like leaving your body or something.

328
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:44,950
Anyone can write a novel, but no one
can beat her cherry pie.

329
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,580
An interesting case, but nothing
to be concerned about.

330
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,630
His memory of the race was expunged
with no residual effects.

331
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,220
He will never run again. He will never
walk again, for that matter.

332
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,430
We'll continue monitoring him for a
while, but anticipate no problems.

333
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:07,100
A record that will live on in people's
memories for years to come.

334
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,190
What more could anyone ask for?

335
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,360
Free...

336
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,900
Did you say something?

337
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,030
Sit down.

338
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,160
Free...

339
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,870
Sit down!

340
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:12,860
Yuki! Hey, girl, time to eat.

341
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,230
Oh, Yuki's my cat.

342
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,370
Well, I don't understand.

343
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,830
If you don't want to go out with him,
why did you say you would?

344
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,040
I mean, you don't want to give him
the wrong idea, do you?

345
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,000
Where is she?

346
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,630
Yuki!

347
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,760
Well, listen, you need to make up your mind.

348
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,180
Where is she?

349
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,520
I'm starting to worry about my cat.

350
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:51,190
She never misses a meal.

351
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:56,940
Yuki?

352
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,490
I'm gonna have to call you back.

353
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,330
Yuki?

354
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,830
Yuki!

355
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,470
We haven't seen her anywhere today, but
we'll be sure to tell you if we do.

356
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:26,010
- Ice cream!
- She's wearing a bell like this one.

357
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,480
- I don't know where your cat is.
- Me either.

358
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,270
I know. She's at the old haunted house.

359
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,730
Hey, look! There's a rainbow over there again.

360
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,030
I don't get it. She likes to stay home.
What is she doing over there?

361
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,240
You know, you're not supposed
to go in there...

362
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:50,580
...but we don't really care about that.
You wanna go?

363
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,420
- Are we going?
- It's probably raining there again.

364
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,290
Let's go!

365
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,170
Nice moves, man.

366
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,800
Come on!

367
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,350
- Hey, it's over here.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.

368
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,560
You sure it's okay to show her?

369
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,110
Hello? Where are you?

370
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,860
Guys? Where'd you go?

371
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,820
Where'd they go?

372
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,370
- Come on, boy.
- Whoa, cool truck!

373
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,870
Settle down!

374
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,040
Hold still!

375
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,620
Sit! Sit!

376
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,380
Hello?

377
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,380
Where is everyone?

378
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,290
Yuki?

379
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,290
Yuki?

380
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,710
Stupid cat.

381
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,610
What's happening? What's going on here?

382
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,820
- I got it!
- Yeah!

383
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,990
Yuki? Is that you?

384
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,870
There you are, Yuki.

385
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:41,830
Come here.

386
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:45,960
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Bad cat.

387
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,090
Bet you're hungry, huh?

388
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:12,160
I figured this out yesterday.
Your cat's okay.

389
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,410
Yeah, thanks.

390
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,910
It's those boys.

391
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,500
- Ready!
- There he goes.

392
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,420
Banzai! Yes!

393
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:33,260
May I have your attention, please.

394
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:36,390
And you are the winner!

395
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:43,150
No fair. He hit the ground.
His nose is bleeding. Look!

396
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,480
I think he's right. He hit the ground.

397
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,610
- Hey, who told her?
- Don't look at me.

398
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,280
- I don't know.
- I didn't tell her.

399
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,870
So this house is haunted.

400
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:42,250
- No way. Wow, this is too much!
- This never happened before.

401
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:55,130
That, that was... What was that?

402
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,140
Hi.

403
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,310
Anybody home?

404
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,780
Yeah, they're gonna tear it down.

405
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:22,240
Come on, come on, come on!

406
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,080
Hey, light as a feather.

407
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,760
- I wanna try! I wanna try!
- Come on, we could help her.

408
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,950
Hey, hey! Come on. Get away from there.
Move along!

409
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:02,700
Yuki, wait!

410
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:07,330
Clear the area. Clear the area immediately.

411
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,540
Get out of here!

412
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:16,760
Yuki!

413
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,970
Where are you?

414
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:22,970
Yuki!

415
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,640
Yuki!

416
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,320
Yuki.

417
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,540
If you don't want to go out
with him, why did you say you would?

418
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,580
I mean, you don't wanna
give him the wrong idea.

419
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,710
Where is she?

420
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,790
Yuki!

421
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:57,590
You need to make up your mind.

422
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,800
Where is she?

423
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:02,510
I'm starting to worry. Yuki!

424
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:08,980
Hey, you! We've got one over here.

425
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,190
You don't belong here.

426
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,110
Move along, folks.

427
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:18,190
Nothing to see here.
Come on, folks, out of the way.

428
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,950
Go about your business.

429
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,780
Let go of me, let go!

430
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:29,160
- Tell me you have all of them.
- Yes, sir. The last one' s over there.

431
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,790
- Examine her. Then let her go.
- Yes, sir.

432
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:40,800
Let go! Listen to me! There's no bugs
in there! It's just some kids!

433
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,880
Let go!

434
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:48,810
- Listen!
- Seal the area off now.

435
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,860
I'm going, I'll see you guys later.

436
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:40,190
- Nothing.
- Yeah, nothing.

437
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,530
Work!

438
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,570
It's not working.

439
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,950
Forget it. Come on, let's go.

440
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:29,620
You know what I mean, Dinah?

441
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,080
I used to think being a private
detective was cool.

442
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:36,580
Like Sam Spade or Phillip Marlowe, right?

443
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:39,840
But there's nothing cool left to it.

444
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,300
On top of that, both my fridge
and my bank account are empty.

445
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:57,400
Wait.

446
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,440
Okay, Dinah, let's bet.

447
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:04,610
If it's another suspicious husband,
I'm out of this business forever.

448
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:09,530
- Hello?
- Mr. Ash, I have a job for you.

449
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:13,290
And you need me to check on your wife, right?

450
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,620
I'm looking for a computer hacker.

451
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:19,130
This hacker goes by the alias Trinity.
That's all we know.

452
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:22,170
Well, it looks like we're still
in business, Dinah.

453
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,630
Fine. And who will I be working for?

454
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,220
- I can't say.
- You can't say.

455
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:30,470
Call me back when you can say.
That's not the way I do business.

456
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,430
It was a pleasure chatting with you.

457
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,730
Before you hang up, take a look
at your bank account balance.

458
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,740
I didn't get a good feeling about the case.

459
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,030
But I had no good reason to turn
the guy down now.

460
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:55,040
This Trinity was well-known
in hacker circles.

461
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,040
A real artist by the sound of it.

462
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:01,630
The cops were always one step behind him.

463
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:05,920
So I knew I could get that close.
Question was, could I get closer?

464
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:09,930
I had a few tricks up my sleeve for
getting to hackers.

465
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:16,600
While I was searching,
I found something strange.

466
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,100
Other detectives had been on the case too.

467
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:27,570
And their investigations had all been,
shall we say, troubled.

468
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,570
One of the guys killed himself.

469
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,070
Another had disappeared.

470
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,200
Another went crazy.

471
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,710
So I paid the one who was left a visit.

472
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,290
The crazy one.

473
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,510
Trinity doesn't exist, man. He's not real.

474
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:55,640
He's a figment. A cipher.
A jabberwocky.

475
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:01,270
And who am I? Who the hell am I?

476
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:10,950
Did I mention he was crazy?

477
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,290
Chessboards, jabberwocky, Red Queen...

478
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,960
I started searching all the usual
hacker hangouts...

479
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,920
...for someone with an Alice in
Wonderland m.o.

480
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:28,550
Hacker bulletin boards, anonymous
mailboxes, chat rooms.

481
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,760
And it was in one of those that
I picked up Trinity's trail.

482
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:41,700
"Six brooks."

483
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,790
"I'll be there at 2005."

484
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:53,880
Of course!

485
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:56,970
Crossing the second brook takes
her into the woods.

486
01:11:57,130 --> 01:11:59,930
Alice jumps the first brook...

487
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,930
...and...

488
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,140
And then she boards a train.

489
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,070
Thanks.

490
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:22,740
Excuse me.

491
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:25,870
Hey!

492
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:27,960
Hey!

493
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,190
I knew this was some kind of trap.

494
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:00,160
There's a difference, Mr. Ash,
between a trap and a test.

495
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,490
You were testing me?

496
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,700
You made it. I'm impressed.

497
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:09,120
Flattery will get you everywhere.

498
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:12,130
I'm not here to flatter you,
I'm here to save you.

499
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,350
What just happened?

500
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,480
Mr. Ash, dream of having an eye exam lately?

501
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,950
Yeah, how'd you know?

502
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:42,950
You've stepped to the edge of
the looking glass.

503
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:48,000
So then, that means I wasn't dreaming.

504
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:55,880
They hired me as a way of
getting to you, didn't they?

505
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:02,300
Go!

506
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:26,990
What the hell is going on here?
This is really crazy.

507
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:30,040
Now I understand what happened
to those other detectives.

508
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,040
They went nuts.

509
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,790
What are you doing? What are you doing, guys?

510
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:38,590
Well, I've gotten out of
worse jams than this.

511
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,630
I am not gonna let them get you.

512
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,470
What's happening to me?

513
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,770
I'm sorry.

514
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,690
You didn't make it, Mr. Ash.

515
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,040
I wish...

516
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,540
...I could go with you.

517
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,830
I don't blame you, you know.

518
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,130
Everything that happened, Trinity,
it was all my fault.

519
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:25,130
All that Through the Looking Glass stuff.

520
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:29,890
Can't get my head around it.
I'm old-fashioned.

521
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:37,270
There's a difference between
a test and a choice.

522
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,780
For what it's worth, I think
you could've handled the truth.

523
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:48,620
It was just a job.

524
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,080
Goodbye, Trinity.

525
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,450
Goodbye.

526
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,750
A case to end all cases.

527
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,040
Wake up. Baby's spotted two
machines heading in fast.

528
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,550
I see them.

529
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:33,970
They're runners.
Think you can handle them?

530
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,380
Watch me.

531
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,350
Okay. I'm in.

532
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:09,520
That runner's smarter than
we've seen so far.

533
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,350
- It's quite a catch.
- Thanks.

534
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,390
Will it? Do you think it'll convert?

535
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,310
To convert is its choice to make.

536
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,780
Do you think maybe we ought to
reprogram it?

537
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,820
No. We can't make slaves of them.

538
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:23,700
Because that would be simpler.

539
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,240
We won't beat the machines
by making them our slaves.

540
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:28,240
Better to let them join us by choice.

541
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:31,500
Make them believe the right choice is
the one we want them to make.

542
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:35,330
All right. Yes, machines are tools.
They're made to be used.

543
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,460
- It's their nature.
- To be slaves.

544
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:40,300
That's why we can show them a
better world, why they convert.

545
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,420
- But that world we show them isn't real.
- It doesn't matter.

546
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:47,010
I'm afraid they'll figure out that
we've made up the thing in our heads.

547
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:51,020
They can't tell the difference. To an
artificial mind, all reality is virtual.

548
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,850
How do they know that the real world
isn't just another simulation?

549
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:55,980
How do you?

550
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:59,980
I know I'm not dreaming now because I
know what it's like being in a dream.

551
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:02,650
So dreaming lets you know reality exists.

552
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:06,660
No. Just that my mind exists.
I don't know about the rest.

553
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:25,670
Okay, he's good to go.
Looks like we are too.

554
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,590
Dreaming already?

555
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,640
He's had a rough day.

556
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:31,600
You poor baby.

557
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:35,600
Would you mind?

558
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:37,400
Not at all.

559
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:40,120
Hello there.

560
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,230
What's happening?

561
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:41,650
Sentinels.

562
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,960
Let's go!

563
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:46,760
Come on, damn it, help me!
