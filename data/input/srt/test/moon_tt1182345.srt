1
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,791
There was a time when
"energy" was a dirty word.

2
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:35,418
When turning on your
lights was a hard choice.

3
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:37,379
Cities in brownout,...

4
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:40,924
food shortages,
cars burning fuel to run.

5
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,510
But that was the past.

6
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:46,471
Where are we now?
How do we make the world so much better?

7
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:48,640
Make deserts bloom!

8
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:53,354
Right now, we are the largest
producer of fusion energy in the world.

9
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,149
The energy of the sun,
trapped in rock,

10
00:00:56,274 --> 00:00:58,860
harvested by machine from
the far side of the moon.

11
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:03,448
Today, we deliver enough
clean-burning helium-3...

12
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:07,202
to supply the energy needs
of nearly 70% of the planet.

13
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,498
Who would have thought that all
energy we ever needed

14
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,584
is right above our heads?

15
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:17,212
The power of the moon...

16
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:20,132
the power of our future.

17
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,461
Rock and roll!
08:32, Pacific Time.

18
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,546
All harvesters running smoothly.

19
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,423
Readouts are as follows:

20
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,260
Matthew...14.6 miles.

21
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:45,762
Mark...16.8 miles.

22
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:47,639
I don't—

23
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:58,567
Hey, Gerty? Gerty?
Wake up!

24
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:00,652
Good morning, Sam!

25
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,655
We have got a live one on Mark!

26
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:04,531
I'm going to go out
now and rope her in.

27
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:05,992
OK, Sam.

28
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,551
I want chocolate.

29
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,428
I think you're sweet enough.

30
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:06,888
You don't need chocolate.

31
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:20,110
[Computer]:
Searching for long-range comms.

32
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:26,783
Searching for long-range comms.

33
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:33,248
Signal failure on long-range comms.

34
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:46,867
Sam Bell, reporting to Central...

35
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,911
10:14, Pacific Time.

36
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:54,374
I have a full container full of helium-3,
ready to roll.

37
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,294
By the time this message reaches you,
it should be in transit.

38
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,505
Otherwise, everything running smoothly...

39
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:02,299
How are things down there?

40
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:05,844
You guys been having any...

41
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,889
good parties or anything?

42
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:10,975
Oh, thanks for the...(stumbles)

43
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,812
for the football feed!
It almost felt live.

44
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:17,022
Almost!

45
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:20,860
Three years is a long haul.

46
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:25,156
You know—
It's way, way, way, way, way too long!

47
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:27,325
I'm talking to myself...

48
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:29,118
on a regular basis!

49
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,453
So...

50
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:34,207
Time to go home,
you know what I mean?

51
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,669
That's it,
over and out!

52
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,255
Rock and roll,
God bless America!

53
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:00,692
I can do that for you, Sam.

54
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,866
God damn it!
I said I got it!

55
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:09,577
Why don't you listen to me?

56
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,587
Package ready for launch.

57
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:44,906
Sam, is everything OK?

58
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,537
- Sam?
- What?

59
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:53,372
You don't seem like yourself today.

60
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,501
- Is something wrong?
- No. Can you turn that off, please?

61
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,461
Jesus Christ!

62
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,884
Sam, it might help you
to talk about it.

63
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,805
Gerty, have you heard anything new
about anyone fixing Lunar-Sat?

64
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,265
the setting of monthly satellite dishes?

65
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,558
No, Sam.

66
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,560
From what I understand,
it is fairly low...

67
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:15,979
on the company's priority list right now.

68
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,564
You tell them to sort that out.

69
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:20,066
You know what I'm talking about?
That's not—

70
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,235
I've only got two weeks!

71
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:25,364
But it's not fair for
whoever's coming up here next.

72
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:29,118
I will, Sam. Do you want me
to finish cutting your hair later?

73
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,203
No, come on;
let's finish this.

74
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,334
Got one of those headaches...

75
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,628
Can you—can you give me
something for it?

76
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:01,651
[Gerty]: Message received
from your wife, Sam...

77
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,528
via Jupiter link.

78
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:06,865
Fuck!

79
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:16,166
Hi, Sam!
It's me.

80
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:20,755
I got your last message.

81
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:23,549
It was really good
to hear your voice.

82
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,551
I miss you, too!

83
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:28,761
I know you're really lonely up there...

84
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:32,516
But I think...
In a lot of ways....

85
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:35,227
it's been really good for you.

86
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:37,229
For both of us.

87
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:40,982
God, I hope you do not mind me saying that.

88
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:45,863
I'm proud of you!

89
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,200
Someone has got something to say.

90
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:53,913
What did you want to say to daddy, baby?

91
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,666
Say "astronaut".

92
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:00,253
Astronaut.
(Sam chuckles)

93
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:02,338
He is an astronaut!

94
00:10:02,672 --> 00:10:06,092
(whispering) Say daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loud.

95
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:08,595
Daddy's an astronaut.

96
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:11,014
Clever girl!
Wave!

97
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,308
Give daddy a wave!

98
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:16,645
Kathy, could you—

99
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:21,024
I can't believe you're
going to be home soon.

100
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,653
It's her birthday next month...

101
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:27,990
And I was thinking about
maybe a playhouse for the garden.

102
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,283
- Gerty!
- We could work at it together.

103
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:32,578
Sam...

104
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,706
I love you!

105
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,583
(softly) I love you!

106
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:40,211
- And I miss you!
- (softly) I miss you!

107
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:43,756
And I can't wait to see you.

108
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,424
OK, sweetheart...

109
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:48,011
Goodbye.

110
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:14,830
Hi, Doug!

111
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:18,376
You're really full of yourself,
aren't you, Doug?

112
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,752
Kath...

113
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:40,982
(tsks) Not good!

114
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,484
[Television]:
What about Dumbo?... (continues)

115
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:29,157
(groans) Fuck!

116
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:30,951
God damn it!

117
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,619
Fuck!

118
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,082
Wasn't kind of smart,
was it, Gerty?

119
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,961
- Sam, can I ask how it happened?
- I told you.

120
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:44,506
I saw something on TV and
I spilled boiling water on my hand.

121
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:47,300
You saw something on TV?

122
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:50,011
Yeah, I something on TV
that distracted me.

123
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,098
Is there something
wrong with that, Gerty?

124
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:55,017
Sam, you said it was the TV
that distracted you...

125
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,729
but when I came in,
the TV wasn't on.

126
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:00,147
Perhaps you were imagining things?

127
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,152
Yeah, you think too much, pal.

128
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,158
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.

129
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:53,953
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes'
"The One and Only")

130
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:06,132
Shut up!

131
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,085
Good morning, Gerty.

132
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:42,420
Good morning, Sam.

133
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:44,297
- How are you today?
- Fine!

134
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:45,882
Fine.

135
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,176
- How is the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore!

136
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:50,137
A little sore. It's OK.

137
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:55,892
- What's for breakfast?
- The usual.

138
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:56,936
Mmhmm.

139
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:04,526
- Two weeks to go, Sam.
- Two weeks to go, buddy!

140
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,654
Would you like some
hot sauce on your beans?

141
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:11,200
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.

142
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:15,371
But, thank you.
Thank you, Gerty.

143
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:16,622
You're welcome, Sam.

144
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:21,418
08:19, Pacific Time.
Readouts are as follows...

145
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,629
Matthew ... 9.8 miles.

146
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:26,841
Mark is less—

147
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,927
- 9...
- Hey, Gerty!

148
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,429
Rock and roll!

149
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,485
Mark—umm...

150
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,696
Mark is 11 miles on the button.

151
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,034
Luke is a little twitchy today.

152
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,717
Hey, Gerty.

153
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,179
Looks like we have got a
live one out on Matthew.

154
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,807
I'm going to go out in a few minutes.
I'm just going to finish my coffee, OK?

155
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,685
OK, Sam.

156
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,317
[Computer]:
Searching for long-range comms.

157
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,449
Signal failure on long-range comms.

158

[Computer]:
Danger. Atmosphere compromised.

159
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:16,308
Where am...

160
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:20,479
- Where am I?
- Sam, you're in the infirmary.

161
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:24,317
You had an accident.
Do you remember what happened?

162
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:33,076
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.

163
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:36,830
Do you remember me?

164
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:40,500
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.

165
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,876
That's good. That is very good.

166
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:45,379
It's nice to see you awake again.

167
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:49,466
I'd like to keep you under observation
here in the infirmary for a few days...

168
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:51,552
And run some tests.

169
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:55,097
How long have I been out?

170
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:58,434
Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.

171
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:01,145
- OK, pal.
- You're still very tired.

172
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:03,230
We can talk later.

173
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:43,356
Hello?

174
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:09,841
(Distant conversation)
[Gerty]: The new Sam is in reworking order.

175
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,970
But we only have two
working harvesters now.

176
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,951
[Overmeyers]: (sarcastically)
Yeah, well,what a surprise!

177
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,934
[Thompson]: Gerty, we're going to have to
find a way to ramp up production.

178
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,394
[Gerty]: I know.

179
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:23,063
[Overmeyers]: This is incredible!
But how do you manage to destroy...

180
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:26,860
a fucking rover, a harvester and
an employee all on the same day?

181
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,862
These were extraordinary
circumstances, as you know.

182
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,282
[Thompson]:
Gerty, what is the status on Harvester 3?

183
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:34,241
How do the repairs look on... (stopped)

184
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,161
- Sam, you're out of bed.
- Yeah.

185
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:41,332
I wanted to stretch my legs a bit.
Who was that?

186
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:46,963
We've been having some problems
with the Lunar-Sat...

187
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:49,174
And our live feed seems to be down.

188
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:51,885
I was recording a video-message for Central...

189
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:54,262
Updating them on your progress.

190
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,348
Sam, you need to stay in bed.

191
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:59,184
You're not ready to walk around yet.

192
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,899
Can you bring me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.

193
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:09,820
Give me some...
Give me all my stuff, you know?

194
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:12,824
Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.

195
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:16,368
- Well, bring them in here.
- Certainly.

196
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:29,299
Excellent, Sam.

197
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:35,347
What...When can I get out of here, Gerty?

198
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,600
Sam, you may have suffered
from brain damage in the crash.

199
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:42,020
This would explain your slight memory
loss and logic impairment.

200
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:47,442
So what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?

201
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:50,070
Central has asked me to
slow down the harvesters...

202
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:53,199
to ensure you have time to
recuperate and get your strength back.

203
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:54,325
(sarcastically) That's terrific!

204
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:56,410
That's fantastic!

205
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:58,704
You can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow.

206
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,501
But it will still be a few more days before you
can resume anything like a normal work schedule.

207
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:06,337
Let's try another test.

208
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:07,589
I don't want to try another test!

209
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:10,091
Please, Sam.

210
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,288
Hey, Gerty?

211
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:43,959
Do you know about this?

212
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:48,464
Matthew has got no velocity readout.
He is completely still.

213
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,341
He must have stalled.

214
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:51,759
Well, he has obviously stalled.

215
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:53,052
Don't you think we should tell Central?

216
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:55,346
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.

217
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:57,849
I will pass on your message.

218
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:41,811
[Gerty]: Message received from Earth
via Jupiter link.

219
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:45,273
[Thompson]: Sam, we appreciate the offer,
but you concentrate on feeling better.

220
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:48,401
[Overmeyers]: Yeah, we don't want
you to take any unnecessary risks.

221
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,112
- You are too important to us.
- You stay put.

222
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:52,906
[Overmeyers]: That is an order.

223
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:54,991
[Thompson]: It's an order, Sam...
from Lunar.

224
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:57,035
[Overmeyers]:
And what we're going to do is send a rescue unit...

225
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:59,996
to tend to the stalled harvester
and get the base back on its feet.

226
00:24:00,497 --> 00:24:03,333
- (under breath) Fuck is with...? What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, Sam.

227
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,627
- What?
- Sam...

228
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:07,505
I'm under strict orders not to let you outside.

229
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:12,801
I don't appreciate that—being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.

230
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:52,426
Gerty!

231
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,100
Gerty!

232
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,893
Gerty, come here!

233
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:04,313
- What happened?
- I do not know, maybe a meteorite...

234
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,607
There have been no meteorites, Sam.

235
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:08,609
Micrometeorites, maybe. I do not know.

236
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:11,112
Either way, there might be
damage to the exterior shell.

237
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:13,907
I think you better...you better
let me go outside and take a look.

238
00:25:14,032 --> 00:25:16,201
There is no damage to the exterior shell.

239
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:18,411
Well, it's not that I don't believe you, Gerty...

240
00:25:18,495 --> 00:25:21,539
But, you know, this thing is
springing leaks like an Acme firehose.

241
00:25:21,832 --> 00:25:24,042
You need to let me go outside
and fix this problem, Gery.

242
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,211
I can't let you go outside, Sam.

243
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:29,464
Gerty, if you don't let me go outside,
we can't fix this leak.

244
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:31,591
I'm not permitted to let you go outside.

245
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:34,553
Just let...
We'll keep it between you and me, ok, pal?

246
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:37,681
This thing is leaking gas. Let's go! Come on...

247
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:40,622
Just to check the exterior shell?

248
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:42,477
- Of course.
- OK, Sam.

249
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:43,645
Thank you.

250
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,078
Gerty!

251
00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:35,033
[Computer]:
Searching for long-range comms.

252
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:39,203
Searching for long-range comms.

253
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:43,791
Searching for long-range comms.

254
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:49,130
Signal failure on long-range comms.

255
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:50,713
Gerty!

256
00:28:51,214 --> 00:28:52,048
Gerty!

257
00:28:55,302 --> 00:28:56,428
I found him outside!

258
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:00,390
I found him outside!

259
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:04,269
Near one of the stalled harvesters...

260
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:05,520
Who is he?

261
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:07,147
Who is he?!

262
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:08,941
We need to get him to the infirmary.

263
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:12,194
Not until you tell me who that is.

264
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,279
You tell me who that is!

265
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:18,951
Sam Bell. We need to get him
to the infirmary immediately.

266
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:33,048
Hello, Sam.

267
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:34,092
How are you feeling?

268
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:42,642
Where—Where am I?

269
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:44,102
The infirmary.

270
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,688
You had an accident out by one of the harvesters.

271
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:47,940
Do you remember?

272
00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:51,484
No, I'm—I'm thirsty.

273
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:54,404
I could get you some water.

274
00:30:01,078 --> 00:30:03,080
I saw someone out there, Gerty.

275
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,628
I saw someone out there.

276
00:30:11,214 --> 00:30:15,051
Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in
the crash and have incurred minor injuries.

277
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:17,887
But, all in all,
the prognosis is good.

278
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:22,267
I'm happy to see you again.

279
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,375
Gerty?

280
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:49,169
Yes, Sam?

281
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:54,591
Is there someone in the room with us?

282
00:30:58,763 --> 00:31:00,306
Sam, get some sleep.

283
00:31:02,183 --> 00:31:03,434
You're very tired.

284
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:29,294
[Tess]: Spoke to Thompson today.

285
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:33,257
They are in Europe, they—he's promising the world.

286
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:42,016
I think it was the right thing.

287
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:48,480
But...it's just such a long time.

288
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,445
I suppose there are—there are things...

289
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:59,326
You know...that needed to happen.

290
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:03,830
I—I need time to think.

291
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,547
Listen...umm...

292
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,632
Sam...

293
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:17,678
Be safe...And I'll...

294
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,346
I'll talk to you soon.

295
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,432
Goodbye.

296
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,839
Gerty?

297
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:56,593
Gerty, what the fu—what the hell's going on?

298
00:32:58,345 --> 00:33:00,430
Who is the guy—
Who is the guy in the rec room?

299
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:02,724
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?

300
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:04,935
Sam, you're out out of bed.

301
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:07,855
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.
Who is the guy?

302
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,523
Who is the guy in the rec room?

303
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:12,734
- Sam Bell.
- Come on, come on, come on!

304
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:15,571
You are Sam Bell.

305
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:19,617
Sam, what is it?

306
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:22,035
It might help to talk about it.

307
00:33:23,162 --> 00:33:24,622
I don't understand what is happening...

308
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:28,167
I think I'm starting to lose my mind.

309
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,544
We can run some tests.

310
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:32,464
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.

311
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,633
They do not know that you were recovered
alive from the accident.

312
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:38,928
"Recovered alive"? What do you mean?
Why did not you report it to Central?

313
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:39,846
What are you talking about?

314
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,723
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

315
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:44,350
Are you hungry?

316
00:34:21,556 --> 00:34:23,141
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks

317
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:30,231
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks,
two weeks, two weeks, two weeks... (exhales)

318
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:59,303
- I'm just getting my slippers...
- I'm using them...I'm using them.

319
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:02,557
These are mine.

320
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,570
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.

321
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:18,824
I'm Sam Bell, too!

322
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,577
- What?
- Well, we've got that going for us.

323
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:26,207
Why...?

324
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,505
How long have you been...

325
00:35:34,256 --> 00:35:35,508
What?

326
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,051
How long have you been here?

327
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,928
About a week.

328
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,389
- So how are you doing?
- What?

329
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,058
How are you doing?

330
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,812
"How am I doing?"

331
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,192
How do you think I'm doing?

332
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,747
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the harvesters?

333
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,544
Harvesters are fine.

334
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:15,007
It's the fact that I'm here talking to a clone
that's slightly troubling.

335
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,135
(chuckles) I'm not a clone.

336
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,179
I'm not a clone!

337
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,648
- You're the clone.
- Okay, Sam.

338
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:33,067
You're not a clone.

339
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:44,537
Hey, hey...You're not looking too good.

340
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:50,377
Sh! Butt out of this!
I'm not even talking to you, pal.

341
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:54,964
I think that Katherine likes you.
I think she likes you a bit.

342
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,342
You're not looking too good, my friend.

343
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,136
I hope you're not feeling too bad.

344
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:00,554
Are you talking to yourself?

345
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,764
- Let's just get you fixed up...
- How long have you been here?

346
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,561
Well, it's about...three years.

347
00:37:08,104 --> 00:37:09,229
For almost three years.

348
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:12,357
Listen, I...

349
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,068
I wanted to thank y—.

350
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,739
I wanted to thank you for, um...

351
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,492
If it wasn't for you, I'd—I...

352
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:26,455
I guess I'd still be in that crashed rover.
You saved my life.

353
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,503
Hey, I know this is weird, you know...?

354
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,090
I'm real lonely, you know, I...(puffs)

355
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:40,511
I just wanted to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?

356
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:49,478
Maybe later.

357
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:59,906
- What are you looking at?
- You look just like me; it's incredible.

358
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:03,368
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?

359
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,496
We look like each other, I guess.
I don't know.

360
00:38:06,914 --> 00:38:08,457
Hey, you know...(chuckles)

361
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:13,462
It's weird for me, too, you know? (stutters)

362
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:21,720
Hey?

363
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:25,766
Hey, you want to play some ping-pong?

364
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:29,853
No.

365
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:32,231
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.

366
00:38:37,027 --> 00:38:39,030
- What's the score?
- 2-18.

367
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:40,490
OK

368
00:38:41,616 --> 00:38:44,452
- Do you want me to show you how to hold that?
- No...No, I...

369
00:38:45,578 --> 00:38:47,580
I don't need you to show me how to hold it!

370
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,417
OK, OK

371
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:53,211
- Yeah, "OK"

372
00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:56,840
- Should we play?
- Yeah!

373
00:39:03,014 --> 00:39:04,264
Fuck! God!

374
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:05,516
Shit!

375
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:06,975
19-2.

376
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:09,061
Yeah...

377
00:39:11,355 --> 00:39:13,023
You want a...You want a stick of gum?

378
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,486
You know...

379
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:19,363
You should approach this in a different way.

380
00:39:21,157 --> 00:39:23,659
- Remember when you went to flight school?
- What are you doing?

381
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:25,120
I'm fixing the net.

382
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:28,331
It is very Zen with ping-pong,
you have to just to relax.

383
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:41,804
How long did it take you took to do that?

384
00:39:43,973 --> 00:39:45,765
Oh, I don't remember doing all of it.

385
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:50,228
I remember doing the church...
and the Salvation Army.

386
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,857
And doing the people.

387
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,026
My mind has been acting kind of weird lately.

388
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:01,699
That's Fairfield, right?

389
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:03,575
There's the town hall.

390
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:06,704
Fairfield, that's right...

391
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:14,754
Yeah, that's Tess...and Eve...

392
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,342
You...

393
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,011
You know Tess?

394
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:30,479
Yeah, I know Tess.

395
00:40:32,355 --> 00:40:34,566
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?

396
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:37,153
I had a...We had a girl...

397
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:41,115
Eve.

398
00:40:44,994 --> 00:40:46,037
Ain't she beautiful?

399
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:48,122
She's my little monkey.

400
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:50,082
She's our little monkey.

401
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,419
High five!

402
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:02,095
She might be the milkman's,
but she's beautiful.

403
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:07,517
[Gerty]:
Sam, a new message has arrived from Earth.

404
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,394
Oh shit!

405
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:17,736
- [Overmeyer]: Greetings, Sam.
- [Thompson] How's our man?

406
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:18,779
You feeling better?

407
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:20,948
- [Overmeyer]: Have you had enough rest?
- [Thompson]: You resting up, Sam?

408
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,742
(chuckling) You better be, you bastard.

409
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:25,327
[Overmeyer]:
Well, enjoy it while it lasts. We've got some good news.

410
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:29,498
[Thompson]: The Jupiter program had to be put on hiatus,
so we've got a few pairs of hands for you.

411
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:33,877
[Overmeyer]: So what we've manage to do is
cue you a rescue unit ahead of schedule.

412
00:41:34,003 --> 00:41:35,338
[Thompson]:
Rescue Unit Eliza.

413
00:41:35,671 --> 00:41:38,882
[Overmeyer]: Eliza has been stationed on
Goliath-19 for the last 2 months.

414
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:41,802
[Thompson]: We expect them to reach you
in approximately 14 hours.

415
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:43,596
[Overmeyer]:
So commence to jump for joy!

416
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,930
[Thompson]:
You're about to be back at work.

417
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:47,642
In the meantime,
hang in there.

418
00:41:48,185 --> 00:41:49,102
Rest up.

419
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:51,103
[Overmeyer]: You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out!

420
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:54,941
They're sending a rescue unit? Why?
Why are they sending a rescue unit?

421
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:58,695
To fix the stalled harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.

422
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:00,280
Well, then I'm going back.

423
00:42:00,906 --> 00:42:01,949
That's it for me.

424
00:42:03,492 --> 00:42:05,577
- What?
- Is that what you really think?

425
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:08,288
Yeah. I've got a contract!

426
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:09,956
I'm going home.

427
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,835
- You're a fucking clone. You don't have shit.
- Hey, I'm going home!

428
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:15,796
- Home!
- You're not going anywhere.

429
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:18,633
You know, you've been up here too long, man.
You have lost your marbles.

430
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:22,177
What do you think, Tess is back home,
waiting on the sofa in lingerie?

431
00:42:22,177 --> 00:42:23,512
What about the original Sam? Huh?

432
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,766
I am the original Sam!

433
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:29,351
- I am Sam-fucking-Bell.
- Hey!

434
00:42:29,477 --> 00:42:30,395
Me!

435
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:32,397
Me!

436
00:42:33,856 --> 00:42:36,150
Gerty, am I a clone?

437
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,113
Are you hungry?

438
00:42:46,035 --> 00:42:47,203
Hey, hey...

439
00:42:48,872 --> 00:42:53,127
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.
I'm in the same boat, asshole.

440
00:42:58,757 --> 00:42:59,799
Listen...

441
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:01,593
- What about the other clones?
- What?

442
00:43:01,802 --> 00:43:03,762
We might not be the first two
to have been woken up.

443
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:06,682
You said that that model had already
been started when you got here.

444
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:07,725
Well, who started it?

445
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,144
There might be others up here right now.

446
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:15,149
Think about it. How did I get up
here so quickly after your crash?

447
00:43:15,566 --> 00:43:18,152
- I don't know...
- They didn't ship me in from Central.

448
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,655
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.

449
00:43:23,283 --> 00:43:25,868
I don't know what you're smoking. Why would
they do that? That's ridiculous.

450
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:27,871
Impossible.

451
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,165
I bet there's some kind of secret room.

452
00:43:30,165 --> 00:43:31,208
"Secret room"?

453
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:33,919
Yeah, a secret room. Why not?

454
00:43:34,002 --> 00:43:36,088
You know, you are the one that has lost your marbles.

455
00:43:36,504 --> 00:43:38,715
I've been here three years, man.

456
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:40,258
I know every inch of this base.

457
00:43:40,383 --> 00:43:43,387
And I know how many dirt is between
those wall panels over there.

458
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:45,472
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?

459
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:47,474
Look, it's a company, right?

460
00:43:48,518 --> 00:43:51,436
They have investors, they have shareholders.
Shit like that.

461
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,440
What's cheaper? Spending time and
money training new personnel...

462
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,151
Or you just have a couple of
spares here to do the job?

463
00:43:57,484 --> 00:43:59,153
It's the far side of the moon!

464
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:02,907
Those cheap fucks haven't even
fixed the communication satellite yet!

465
00:44:05,284 --> 00:44:08,120
- Tess would know, she would have told me...
- Hey, Gepetto, wake up!

466
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:10,832
You really think they give a shit about us?

467
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:12,792
They're laughing all the way to the bank!

468
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,669
Tess would know, she would have told me...

469
00:44:14,711 --> 00:44:15,629
Where do you get off?!

470
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:18,631
Fucking sitting there sulking
like a little fucking boy!

471
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:20,842
- Jesus Christ...
- Wake up!

472
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:26,682
There's some area that we don't know about.

473
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,558
And I'm going to find it.

474
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:32,604
Yeah, maybe you'll find some
buried treasure, too.

475
00:45:07,348 --> 00:45:08,392
Fuck!

476
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:12,146
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 13 hours.

477
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,273
You find your secret room?

478
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:18,610
Just put that anywhere.

479
00:45:20,488 --> 00:45:22,656
Yes, that's a good idea...

480
00:45:22,864 --> 00:45:24,867
- That's where I keep my leprechauns.
- Get out of the way.

481
00:45:25,701 --> 00:45:28,704
- What? Why?
- I want to look underneath that model.

482
00:45:29,747 --> 00:45:31,332
You're not touching this model.

483
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,710
Get the fuck out of the way!

484
00:45:34,252 --> 00:45:36,129
Listen, why don't you just relax, right?

485
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:38,422
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?

486
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:40,800
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- Oh, you're a tough guy now?

487
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:42,052
What, are you going to stab me?

488
00:45:42,594 --> 00:45:46,014
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

489
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:49,100
Put the knife down.
I want to look underneath there.

490
00:45:49,142 --> 00:45:50,936
- Put the knife down.
- No, I'm not going to give you the knife.

491
00:45:50,936 --> 00:45:52,353
- What?
- Just get out of the way.

492
00:45:52,395 --> 00:45:53,730
- Take it easy.
- Let go of the knife.

493
00:45:53,856 --> 00:45:55,524
Don't ever tell me what to do.

494
00:45:56,775 --> 00:45:59,152
- Let go.
- You let go of the knife.

495
00:45:59,695 --> 00:46:01,447
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.

496
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:04,074
- Don't push me, motherfucker!
- Let go.

497
00:46:04,783 --> 00:46:05,951
Let go!

498
00:46:16,795 --> 00:46:18,756
What did I fucking tell you?
"Let go of the goddamn knife."

499
00:46:26,472 --> 00:46:28,140
You fucking little girl, man!

500
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:39,526
Damn it! What did I tell you?

501
00:46:50,996 --> 00:46:53,791
You going to stop?
You going to stop?

502
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:55,377
OK!

503
00:46:55,794 --> 00:46:57,879
OK!

504
00:46:58,505 --> 00:46:59,840
Jesus, fuck!

505
00:47:01,716 --> 00:47:04,010
Fuck me! What the fuck?

506
00:47:04,427 --> 00:47:06,721
I hardly...I hardly touched you.

507
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,348
Let me see.

508
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,392
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!

509
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:08,035
Hello, Sam.

510
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:11,580
Sam, is everything OK?

511
00:48:12,206 --> 00:48:13,041
Yeah!

512
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:19,088
Yeah, we had a fight.
Me and the other guy, the other...

513
00:48:21,174 --> 00:48:24,010
He's very angry, you know?

514
00:48:24,636 --> 00:48:26,095
You know what he did?

515
00:48:26,596 --> 00:48:28,473
He flipped my entire model over!

516
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:30,475
You know how much work I put into that thing?

517
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:32,352
938 hours.

518
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,938
938 hours. Yeah, exactly.

519
00:48:36,523 --> 00:48:38,525
938 hours, really?

520
00:48:38,566 --> 00:48:40,569
Approximately.

521
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,988
He's got a problem.

522
00:48:45,365 --> 00:48:46,742
He scares me, Gerty.

523
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:49,119
What is it about Sam that scares you?

524
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,912
The guy flies off the handle.

525
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,832
I see it now. I see what Tess was talking about.

526
00:48:58,504 --> 00:49:00,506
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...

527
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,639
She—She left me. Tess left me.

528
00:49:08,932 --> 00:49:11,559
For 6 months. She moved back in with her parents.

529
00:49:11,768 --> 00:49:12,894
I know.

530
00:49:18,024 --> 00:49:19,776
She gave me a second chance.

531
00:49:20,944 --> 00:49:24,489
- I promised here that I'd change.
- You have changed, Sam.

532
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,660
Hey, Gerty, since I've been up here,
I've sent Tess...

533
00:49:29,786 --> 00:49:31,789
I've sent her over a hundred video messages.

534
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:33,749
Where did those messages go?

535
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:35,626
Did they ever reach her?

536
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:39,171
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.

537
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,593
What about the messages she sent to me?

538
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,598
Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.

539
00:50:05,991 --> 00:50:09,327
Gerty...Gerty?

540
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:17,044
Am I really a clone?

541
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,257
When you first arrived at Sarang,
there was a small crash.

542
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:27,054
You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered
minor brain damage and memory loss.

543
00:50:27,138 --> 00:50:30,057
I kept you under observation
and ran some tests.

544
00:50:30,098 --> 00:50:31,601
I remember, yea, I remember that...

545
00:50:31,642 --> 00:50:34,812
Sam, there was no crash.
You were being awakened.

546
00:50:34,854 --> 00:50:37,982
It is standard procedure for
all new clones to be given tests...

547
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:40,609
 to establish mental stability..

548
00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:42,361
and general physical health.

549
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:46,324
Genetic abnormalities and minor
duplication errors in the DNA...

550
00:50:46,449 --> 00:50:48,117
can have considerable impact on...

551
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:50,412
What about Tess? What about Eve?

552
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,706
They are memory implants, Sam.

553
00:50:52,914 --> 00:50:57,502
Uploaded, edited memories
of the original Sam Bell.

554
00:51:17,314 --> 00:51:19,275
I'm very sorry. 

555
00:51:22,528 --> 00:51:25,323
Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal.

556
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:27,324
Can I prepare you something?

557
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:14,540
[Computer]:
Rescue arrival estimated in 11 hours.

558
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:23,008
- You OK, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm staring into space.

559
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,595
Hey! Thanks for this, this is good.

560
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:31,015
This is cozy. How's the nose?

561
00:52:31,975 --> 00:52:33,726
Much better, thank you.

562
00:52:35,312 --> 00:52:39,774
I went haywire before.
You know...I lost it. I...

563
00:52:42,403 --> 00:52:44,988
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's OK.

564
00:52:45,114 --> 00:52:50,619
No, it's not OK. I fucked up Fairfield. I fucked up your model.
I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got...

565
00:52:51,162 --> 00:52:53,039
I've got a temper, I've got to do something about that.

566
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:54,790
Yes, you do.

567
00:52:56,876 --> 00:52:58,669
(Music player plays Katrina and the Waves'
"Walking on Sunshine")

568
00:52:58,878 --> 00:53:01,172
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.

569
00:53:01,798 --> 00:53:03,257
Can you turn that off?

570
00:53:04,092 --> 00:53:05,968
Listen. (Music stops) Listen.

571
00:53:05,968 --> 00:53:07,616
(music resumes)
I wasn't supposed to...

572
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:12,851
I'm trying to tell you something.

573
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:15,457
(music stops)

574
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:17,647
I never instructed Gerty to...
(music resumes)

575
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:23,069
(music stops)
Listen to me. I wasn't supposed to find you...(music resumes)

576
00:53:24,425 --> 00:53:24,946
(music stops)

577
00:53:25,885 --> 00:53:26,927
(music resumes)

578
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:30,577
(music stops)
Tough Guy.

579
00:53:30,661 --> 00:53:35,374
- Listen to me!
- You look like a radioactive tampon.

580
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:36,938
Like a banana with a yeast infection.

581
00:53:39,336 --> 00:53:42,256
Listen to me. I wasn't supposed to find you.

582
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:46,927
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside
the base while you were out there.

583
00:53:47,261 --> 00:53:49,764
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened...

584
00:53:50,598 --> 00:53:54,143
I walked in on Gerty talking with Central.
He was having a live conversation.

585
00:53:54,978 --> 00:53:56,437
"A live conversation"?

586
00:53:56,938 --> 00:54:00,191
- Yeah
- How do you know it was a live conversation?

587
00:54:01,026 --> 00:54:03,820
Because it was a back-and-forth exchange.

588
00:54:05,072 --> 00:54:07,866
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.

589
00:54:07,908 --> 00:54:12,579
- It was live, man, it was live.
- That's impossible. There was a flare, it fried the satellite.

590
00:54:12,704 --> 00:54:17,084
The satellite is fine. They don't want us
to be able to contact Earth. They lied to us.

591
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,338
They've been lying to us since the beginning.
They've been lying since forever.

592
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:25,300
If the satellite works, how are they
blocking the live feed from down here?

593
00:54:25,426 --> 00:54:27,386
Everything works fine.

594
00:54:27,804 --> 00:54:31,265
Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base?

595
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:33,434
From where, then?

596
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,542
[Computer]:
Searching for long-range comms. 

597
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:04,216
[Sam]: I'm just passing the last of
the harvesters. Looks like John.

598
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,888
How long until you are out of the base's range?

599
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:10,764
Um, a minute.

600
00:55:11,515 --> 00:55:14,852
- 90 seconds tops.
- Have you ever been out this far?

601
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,397
No...never have.

602
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,278
[Computer]:
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

603
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,197
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

604
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,533
Leaving Sarang working perimeter.

605
00:55:42,379 --> 00:55:45,716
- See anything?
- It'd help if I knew what the hell I was looking for.

606
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:50,721
Wait a second, I see something.

607
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:53,517
[Computer]:
Approaching station 3.

608
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:40,231
Holy shit! I think I see something, too.

609
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,733
[Computer]:
Approaching station 1.

610
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:51,826
Do you see what I see? Looks like
an antenna or...or...

611
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:54,537
A pylon or something. I think it's the jammer.

612
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:59,417
Dude! This is why we're not getting the live feed.

613
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:22,484
- Sam? Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

614
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:26,237
Yeah, yeah I hear you.

615
00:57:28,406 --> 00:57:31,743
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm going to—I'm going to head back to the base.

616
00:57:32,285 --> 00:57:36,039
OK, I'm going to stay out here for a while.
I'm going to see if there's any more of these things.

617
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:05,653
Fuck...Fuck...Fuck.

(chuckles) My hair's falling out.

624
01:00:43,399 --> 01:00:44,984
(hacking cough)
How about that for a status?

625
01:00:45,402 --> 01:00:47,487
We'll do this another time.

626
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:11,262
Fuck!

627
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:18,561
I'm going to go see her soon.

Lay down, relax and breathe deeply.

630
01:02:25,088 --> 01:02:29,051
The cryogenic protection pod is designed
to put you into a deep sleep for...

631
01:02:29,135 --> 01:02:32,888
The duration of your three-day return
journey back to Earth.

632
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:37,893
As you begin to feel sleepy,
think about the magnificent job that you've done.

633
01:02:37,935 --> 01:02:41,438
And how proud your family are
of what you've accomplished.

634
01:02:41,772 --> 01:02:46,778
Lunar Industries remains the #1 provider
of clean energy worldwide...

635
01:02:46,861 --> 01:02:49,989
Due to the hard work of people like you.

636
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:53,659
Safe trip, "Annyeong-hi kyeseyo" and goodbye.

638
01:04:44,482 --> 01:04:46,902
Hey, I saw 3 more of those jammers.

639
01:04:48,779 --> 01:04:51,490
I think the base is surrounded with them.
I printed out their coordinates.

640
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:54,617
Bud, what's wrong with you?

641
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:56,494
What's going on?

642
01:04:57,746 --> 01:04:59,497
I found your secret room.

643
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:23,063
- Who goes first?
- I go first.

644
01:06:19,497 --> 01:06:21,874
Jesus Christ, there's so many of them.

645
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,919
Why are there so many of them?

646
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:11,926
Sam, can I help you with something?

647
01:07:12,885 --> 01:07:15,596
Not now, Gerty. I'm OK.

648
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:23,313
Gerty, why did you help me before?

649
01:07:23,813 --> 01:07:27,901
With the password? Doesn't that go
against your programming or something?

650
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:29,861
Helping you is what I do.

- Is this the Bell family?
- This is the Bell residence.

658
01:08:31,925 --> 01:08:34,219
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.

659
01:08:34,512 --> 01:08:36,722
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

660
01:08:37,765 --> 01:08:40,476
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.

661

- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so.

662
01:09:02,249 --> 01:09:05,168
I'm her daughter. Can I help you?

663
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:09,965
Eve?

- Sweetheart...

667
01:09:23,437 --> 01:09:25,398
How did mommy die, sweetheart?

668
01:09:27,483 --> 01:09:29,277
How did mommy die?

669
01:09:29,902 --> 01:09:32,488
- Dad!
- Yeah.

670
01:09:32,821 --> 01:09:36,158
- There's someone asking about mom.
- Who's asking about mom?

671
01:09:47,942 --> 01:09:50,445
That's enough.
That's enough.

672
01:09:55,971 --> 01:09:57,431
I want to go home!

01:10:03,687 --> 01:10:05,439

- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.

677
01:10:49,777 --> 01:10:51,027
What are you laughing at?

678
01:10:51,528 --> 01:10:56,242
Well, you don't hold it like you're trying
to stab somebody, for God's sakes.

679
01:10:56,242 --> 01:10:57,284
Here, give me that.

680
01:11:02,915 --> 01:11:06,336
You've got to hold it closer to the blade, you see?
Watch what I'm doing.

Well, you're sitting under the fridge.
What's going on with you?

685
01:11:31,986 --> 01:11:32,821
You all right?

686
01:11:34,615 --> 01:11:36,909
Yeah, that crew they're sending us...

687
01:11:37,952 --> 01:11:42,331
If they find us awake at the same time,
they aren't going to let us live.

01:11:45,459 --> 01:11:46,794
You know that, right?

689
01:11:49,422 --> 01:11:51,716
You know, the return vehicle is a...

690
01:11:57,347 --> 01:11:58,806
You OK?

691
01:12:02,143 --> 01:12:05,563
You should lay down for a while.
Take some tranquilizers or something.

692
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:08,483
"Take some tranquilizers"?
I'll never wake up again.

693
01:12:17,368 --> 01:12:20,287
You're going to be OK.
Everything's going to be OK.

694
01:12:31,549 --> 01:12:32,884
I'm freezing.

695
01:12:45,084 --> 01:12:48,524
Hey, hey?
Hey?

696
01:12:55,616 --> 01:12:57,492
I'm really scared.

697
01:13:04,061 --> 01:13:05,417
Where are you going?

698
01:13:59,348 --> 01:14:00,682
[Eve, video playback]:
Hello?

699
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:05,187
- [Sam]: Is this the Bell residence?
- [Eve]: This is the Bell residence.

700
01:14:05,812 --> 01:14:08,190
Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.

701
01:14:09,565 --> 01:14:11,234
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

702
01:14:11,443 --> 01:14:14,154
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.

703
01:14:15,697 --> 01:14:19,659
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.

704
01:14:20,285 --> 01:14:21,661
Can I help you?

705
01:15:18,804 --> 01:15:20,973
Gerty, I need to talk to you.

706
01:15:21,181 --> 01:15:23,059
Of course, Sam, how can I help?

707
01:15:23,184 --> 01:15:25,144
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.

708
01:15:26,312 --> 01:15:28,397
That hidden room, Gerty.

709
01:15:28,814 --> 01:15:32,443
The lower deck is out-of-bounds
to awakened clones, Sam.

710
01:15:33,277 --> 01:15:35,655
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.

711
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:39,743
New clones can only be awakened once a
three-year contract is completed.

712
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:43,288
Gerty, if you don't wake up another clone,
me and the other Sam will die.

713
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:45,707
We will be killed, do you understand?

714
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:48,710
- Yes
- You want me and the other Sam to be killed?

715
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:52,381
- That is the last thing I want.
- Well, then you have to wake up a new clone.

716
01:15:52,672 --> 01:15:54,257
OK, pal?

717
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:10,733
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 5 hours.

718
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,696
(Alarm clock blares Chesney Hawkes'
"The One and Only")

719
01:17:11,213 --> 01:17:13,089
What's going on? You OK?

720
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:16,635
Don't—Don't touch him.

721
01:17:19,346 --> 01:17:20,472
Come here.

722
01:17:22,682 --> 01:17:26,436
He's not conscious yet.
Gerty and I just woke him up.

723
01:17:26,436 --> 01:17:28,939
Why? What's going on?

724
01:17:29,147 --> 01:17:30,816
Come on outside.

725
01:17:35,613 --> 01:17:40,076
When the rescue unit arrives, they're going
to expect to find a body in that crashed rover.

726
01:17:41,244 --> 01:17:42,703
That guy?

727
01:17:44,372 --> 01:17:46,040
(chuckles) What, are you going to kill him?

728
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:48,960
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?

729
01:17:49,043 --> 01:17:50,836
Zip up your fly.

730
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:55,716
You're burning up.
Sweating like a pig.

731
01:17:57,803 --> 01:18:01,264
Put your hat on.
Put your hat on.

732
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:15,029
If I go through with this, I'm going to need
your help hauling him out to the crash site.

733
01:18:15,862 --> 01:18:17,198
What about us?

734
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:20,659
When Eliza arrives, it finds you and me as a welcome party...

735
01:18:20,493 --> 01:18:23,329
They aren't going to find you and me as a welcome party.
They're going to find me.

736
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:25,747
You're going back to Earth before they get here.

737
01:18:26,499 --> 01:18:31,378
In that helium-3 launcher. I did the math; you're going to
pull some G's. But you'll be fine. You'll be all right.

738
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:34,841
You're going home.

739
01:18:35,466 --> 01:18:37,343
You did your three years.

740
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:40,763
They can't expect you to stick around.

741
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,100
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

742
01:18:44,517 --> 01:18:46,311
I saw that V.P.

743
01:18:46,603 --> 01:18:49,856
She's beautiful. She's gorgeous.

744
01:18:50,273 --> 01:18:51,733
You did good.

745
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:53,694
High five!

746
01:19:03,204 --> 01:19:04,956
Go for it.

747
01:19:15,299 --> 01:19:17,801
- Are you comfy?
- No.

748
01:19:18,094 --> 01:19:19,679
- What?
- No!

749
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:30,523
- What if I have to take a shit?
- (laughs) Well, I guess you'll just have to hold it in, pal.

750
01:19:31,357 --> 01:19:32,817
For three days?

751
01:19:34,361 --> 01:19:36,028
That's the way it goes.

752
01:19:36,363 --> 01:19:39,365
- Need a hand?
- No.

753
01:19:41,034 --> 01:19:43,620
OK. All right.

754
01:19:43,662 --> 01:19:46,164
No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.

755
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,917
[Computer]:
Eliza arrival estimated in 3 hours.

756
01:20:58,739 --> 01:21:01,033
Hey, we need to do this.
If we wait too long...

757
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,828
The other one's going to be conscious.

758
01:21:06,748 --> 01:21:08,333
What's going on with you?

759
01:21:09,792 --> 01:21:11,753
I changed my mind. I'm not going back.

760
01:21:14,881 --> 01:21:16,884
I don't think I can move my legs.

761
01:21:17,508 --> 01:21:18,969
Besides, look at me!

762
01:21:19,386 --> 01:21:20,845
If I meet Eve now...

763
01:21:22,097 --> 01:21:24,182
I'd scare the crap out of her!

764
01:21:26,143 --> 01:21:30,231
What are you talking about, man? She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.

765
01:21:32,942 --> 01:21:36,153
You're not going to kill anybody.
We can't kill anybody.

766
01:21:36,696 --> 01:21:39,198
You can't. I know you can't,
because I can't.

767
01:21:40,742 --> 01:21:41,992
You go.

768
01:21:45,747 --> 01:21:47,332
You're a good guy, Sam.

769
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,711
And it was a good plan. You know, you
just picked the wrong guy to go back.

770
01:22:02,348 --> 01:22:04,641
Are you sure about this?

771
01:22:07,977 --> 01:22:11,398
Yeah. You should—You should travel, you know?

772
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:14,443
I always wanted to do that.

773
01:22:16,195 --> 01:22:17,571
Amsterdam or...

774
01:22:18,197 --> 01:22:22,869
Yeah, I was thinking about Hawaii
or maybe...Mexico.

775
01:22:23,286 --> 01:22:24,954
Aloha!

776
01:22:26,206 --> 01:22:29,125
Bring me back a piña colada. All right, pal?

777
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:18,050
Hey, Johnny Spaceman?

778
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,264
Do you remember when Tess
came in for that interview?

779
01:23:24,514 --> 01:23:26,600
She was so beautiful.

780
01:23:27,226 --> 01:23:30,563
She wasn't the best candidate,
but it didn't matter...

781
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,691
I had to give her the job.

782
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:36,611
I wanted to keep her in the country.

783
01:23:38,154 --> 01:23:40,239
(said together)
She was going back to Ireland.

784
01:23:44,118 --> 01:23:46,079
And you knew you had to take a chance.

785
01:23:46,704 --> 01:23:49,416
So...you called her...

786
01:23:49,749 --> 01:23:52,669
You were terrified with that whole
speech for the answering machine...

787
01:23:52,669 --> 01:23:54,545
but you didn't need it,
because she picked up the phone.

788
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:57,048
She was like, "Why is he calling me?"

789
01:23:57,674 --> 01:24:00,593
"The internship is over.
Why is he calling me at home?"

790
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:07,476
I asked her if she wanted to get an
ice cream cone or something dorky like that.

791
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:10,687
She said, "Let's get a drink."

792
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,276
I said, "OK." We...

793
01:27:04,826 --> 01:27:07,120
Sam, this is not going to work.

794
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,226
Why?

795
01:27:09,226 --> 01:27:12,251
I have recorded everything that has
taken place since your awakening.

796
01:27:13,293 --> 01:27:17,464
If anyone were to check my memory cache,
it would put you in considerable danger.

797
01:27:21,219 --> 01:27:26,015
You could erase my memory banks.
I could reboot myself once you have departed.

798
01:27:26,932 --> 01:27:29,977
- Are you okay with that?
- I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

799
01:27:30,185 --> 01:27:31,854
- I want to help you.

I set your...I set your
computer to reboot...

803
01:28:03,637 --> 01:28:06,974
- the moment that I launch.
- I understand, Sam.

804
01:28:07,099 --> 01:28:08,517
You should be OK.

805
01:28:08,559 --> 01:28:11,770
I hope life on Earth is everything
you remember it to be.

806
01:28:14,064 --> 01:28:15,316
Thanks, Gerty.

807
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:19,612
- Are you going to be OK?
- Of course.

808
01:28:19,695 --> 01:28:23,867
The new Sam and I will be back to our
programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.

809
01:28:25,659 --> 01:28:30,665
Gerty, we're not programmed.
We're people. Understand?

You OK, buddy?

Cavalry's here.

816

Where am I?

817
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,307
- You're in the infirmary.
You've had an accident.

818
01:30:49,142 --> 01:30:51,853
- How long have I been out.
- Not long, Sam.

819
01:30:52,061 --> 01:30:53,730
Do you remember what happened?

820
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:19,673
[Eliza Member]:
We've made contact.

821
01:31:31,894 --> 01:31:34,397
Eliza, he ain't going nowhere.

822
01:31:35,314 --> 01:31:38,360
Bag him up and we'll get started on
repairs to the harvester.

823
