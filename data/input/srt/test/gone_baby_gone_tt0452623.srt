PATRICK: I always believed
it was the things you don't choose

3
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:45,564
that makes you who you are.

4
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:49,239
Your city.

5
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,210
Your neighborhood.

6
00:00:53,047 --> 00:00:54,571
Your family.

7
00:00:57,452 --> 00:01:00,683
People here take pride in these things.

8
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:03,623
Like it was something
they'd accomplished.

9
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:09,254
The bodies around their souls.

10
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:13,231
The cities wrapped around those.

11
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,920
I lived on this block my whole life.

12
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,390
Most of these people have.

13
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:49,799
When your job is to find people
who are missing,

14
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:52,500
it helps to know where they started.

15
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:57,338
I find the people
who started in the cracks,

16
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:59,278
and then fell through.

17
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:07,549
This city can be hard.

18
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:12,988
When I was young, I asked my priest
how you could get to heaven

19
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,259
and still protect yourself
from all the evil in the world.

20
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:24,506
He told me what God said
to his children.

21
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:28,875
"You are sheep among wolves,

22
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:32,109
"be wise as serpents,

23
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:35,117
"yet innocent as doves."

24
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:37,783
You live just across the street.
Is that right, ma'am?

25
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:40,256
That one on the corner,
that's our house.

26

in high school, you have...

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

28
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,558
- I heard they had an opening.
- Yeah, me, too.

29
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,369
The thing is, she always
had a smile on her face.

30
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:04,677
That was her. She was always smiling.

31
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:07,914
I mean, who would take my little girl?

32
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,750
She never hurt anybody,
never caused...

33
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:14,350
Whoever you are, if you have her,

34
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:16,656
you just let her go.

35
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,197
Now, we won't charge you,

36
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,867
but if you're out there,
just let her come home.

37
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:26,700
All right? Let her come home.

HELENE ON TV: I mean,
who would take my little girl?

39
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,374
- You fucking cops.
- She never caused no trouble,

40
00:03:31,443 --> 00:03:33,911
she never got in any fights,
she's a sweetheart.

41
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,142
- This is just unbelievable.
- She was a good kid.

42
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,309
The whole force
standing outside the house,

43
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,286
guarding the sidewalk
with their arms crossed.

was taken from her home

between 8:00 and 8:30
Wednesday night.

47
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,827
She's four years old,
has blond hair and green eyes...

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,924
- Hey.
- Hey.

...weighs 35 pounds
and is 40 inches tall.

- Yeah. I know.

MAN 2 ON TV: A beleaguered
police force and a weary citizenry

52
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,741
have been left with so little to cling to.

53
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,770
A blanket, a back door,
and a doll named Mirabelle.

54
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,645
The neighborhood's
really coming together.

55
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,809
We're gonna have a rally.

56
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,412
Everyone's gonna have a vigil.
We're gonna have a vigil tonight.

57
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,218
You know, the neighborhood's all alert,

58
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,590
everybody's alert of what's going on
and everything that...

59
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:25,155
The surroundings. We got flyers up,
posters up, we have all that stuff up.

60
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:28,202
So everybody's well aware
and everybody's looking for Amanda.

00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,968
spoke a few words a moment ago,

64
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,567
words of comfort.

65
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:42,014
I know the pain of losing a daughter.
We will not fail.

66
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:45,285
We will pursue every avenue.

MAN 3 ON TV: Captain Jack Doyle on
details of the missing Dorchester girl...

69
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:52,958
Little bit.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.

70
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:54,723
She was blowing Mike Gulley
down the post

71
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:58,197
when he was still 14 and innocent
and milking cows up Vermont.

72
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:00,865
I don't know about innocent.

73
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:04,497
Her mother says Amanda
may be carrying a little girl of her own.

74
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:07,872
Mirabelle was last seen with Amanda.
It's her favorite doll.

75
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,238
This is horrible.

76
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:15,183
- Not if you're Channel 9.
- Turn it off.

Our niece was kidnapped
three days ago.

87
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:54,145
Please, come on in. Come on in.
I have to apologize.

88
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:56,886
You know, there's been some problems
with kids in the neighborhood,

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,451
kind of ding-dong ditch,
ringing the buzzer and running away.

No. Please, please.
Make yourself comfortable.

I'm sorry about the mess.

We've just been working a lot,

This is my husband, Lionel.

to augment the investigation.

to Precision Investigators.

- I don't know, I meant...

Yeah, that's what your ad says
in the paper.

00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:11,101
Yeah, we are.
We are missing persons detectives.

I'm sorry, she...
I think that what Angie means to say is,

120
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:16,671
just for the sake of disclosure,
up to this point,

121
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:21,509
our experience has been primarily,
you know, finding missing persons

122
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,480
who've gone missing that they...

123
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:25,449
You know, they just stop payments on
their Jet Ski

124
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:26,542
and they went to New Hampshire...

125

Every police officer in this state
is looking for your niece right now.

126
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,890
And I'm not sure
how much more help we could be.

127
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,426
Well, you're not gonna
do any harm, are you?

128
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:37,952
All right, look.
I got a pension coming up with Edison.

129
00:07:38,064 --> 00:07:40,430
- So, that's collateral, if...
- No. It's not that.

130
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,298
Why is this so hard?
The cops don't want me coming here.

131
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,701
- Lionel don't want me coming here.
- Don't worry.

132
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,205
- Now you don't want the job?
- No, it's not that we don't want the job...

133
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:50,766
We consult privately
before we make decisions like these.

134
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:53,472
- We do.
- Helene puts her to bed.

135
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:56,641
She goes across to Dottie's.
Maybe gone a half hour, watches TV.

136
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:59,082
Then she comes home
and Amanda is gone.

137
00:07:59,152 --> 00:08:00,585
LIONEL: She was watching Wife Swap.

138
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,849
She remembers,
'cause that's her favorite show.

00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,185
And do youse two live upstairs?

140
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:07,352
Yeah, when our folks died
they left us a unit and my sister a unit,

141
00:08:07,428 --> 00:08:10,090
so, you know,
basically we got no choice.

142
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:11,358
And with the acoustics
in the apartment,

143
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,456
you can't get away from it.

144
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,364
Why don't you just
come over the house, all right?

145
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:17,461
- Just talk to Helene, you know.
- BEA: Lionel, talk to Helene?

146
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,733
Look, she don't show it,
but she's hurting right now.

147
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:22,401
- Please. Please!
- All right. Lookit, all right?

148
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:25,071
I was no saint. All right?
I had my own problems.

149
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:28,309
I took a hard bust at 22.
Bea straightened me out.

150
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,816
My sister Helene has not had that.

151
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:34,678
Talking to the mother's
the least we could do.

152
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:36,848
- We'll come right over.
- Thanks a lot.

153
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,323
Yeah. Pleasure, Lionel.

He may look young,

he'd better not act it.

Well, he's been hired by a woman
who's the victim of a crime,

and by law he's entitled
as her representative

to be cooperated with
by the Boston Police Department.

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,974
You saw her on the news, right?

309
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,782
She's saying, "Oh, I was at my
neighbor's house for a half hour."

310
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:20,916
Bullshit. She was in here for, like,
two hours bumping rails. Oh, yeah.

311
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:24,484
- ANGIE: What time did she come in?
- 8:00.

312
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,690
- Are you sure it was the same night?
- Fucking positive,

313
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:29,859
'cause she was in the shitter,
fucking banging down rails with Ray,

314
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:31,494
and I was banging on the fucking door.

315
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:33,766
- Who, Ray? Skinny Ray?
- Yeah. Ray Likanski.

316
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,603
He's in there ducking me
like a fucking faggot.

317
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:36,664
I was banging on the door.

318
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:37,800
He thought I didn't know
he was in there,

319
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:39,469
but I know he's fucking in there.

320
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:42,571
- Don't lend him any money...
- Hey, Stevie.

321
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:46,607
- What the fuck you doing?
- Nothing. What's up, Lenny?

322
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:48,779
Don't talk about people you don't know.

323
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:50,117
What do you mean?
These are my friends.

324
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:52,350
- I know them for years.
- What's the problem, guy?

325
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:54,656
You said you weren't a cop.
Right, "guy"?

326
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:57,423
- Yeah, I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, then why don't you fuck off?

327
00:18:57,497 --> 00:18:59,328
Why don't you mind your business?

328
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:01,764
He's gonna come in here
and be a smartass?

329

You're awfully worried
about people's asses there, Dave.

330
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:07,570
Yeah, you probably got
a fucking ass like a Skippy jar.

What are you doing here, anyway?

find her daughter. Is that all right?

333
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:15,613
Listen, don't come in here
running your mouth,

334
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:17,377
thinking you're better than me.

335
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:19,612
I'm not the fucking one.

336
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:21,586

- LENNY: Cool it.

- Bet she fucks this asshole in half.

is the matter with you guys?

You, you punk fucking jackass.

We're leaving, all right?

341
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:47,314
You know, Dave,
I think it's your good looks...

342
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,647
'Cause there is some fine pussy
in here tonight.

343
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:03,561
Open that door, rummy.

344
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,563
- Open the door, Mike.
- Now.

You ever wanna get fucked,
let me know.

say some shit, Fat Dave?

- Fuck you!

- Make it!
- Get the fuck out.

00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:41,232
Make me a fucking martini,
you fat fucking retard!

No! I just...

Serial molester, recently work-released.

Amanda disappeared.

(PATRICK EXCLAIMS)

369
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,647
The Tretts were released six
and eight months ago, respectively.

370
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,877
They have drug habits.

371
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,715
We don't know where they are,
but we think Corwin's with them.

372
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:06,383
Jailhouse snitch claims
that Corwin confided in him

373
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,121
and told him when he got out,
he was gonna move in with his family.

374
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,889
Apparently the three of them

375
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,932
have some kind of
Addams Family deal going on.

376
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,367
Corwin's plan is to keep a kid
in the house to have sex with.

377
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,873
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Not for Amanda, it doesn't.

378
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,238
ANGIE: Do you think
this is who has Amanda?

379
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,742
Well, there's a lot
of holes in our theory.

380
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,006
I mean, Corwin likes
little boys, you know?

381
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,947
He likes them seven or eight or nine.

382
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:35,285
So that's it, that's all we got,
there's no other leads, three days in?

383
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,413
No, we got more.

384
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:39,049
We got six psychics telling us to look
in six different states,

385
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,820
we got Lionel and Bea
with airtight alibis,

386
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,554
we've interviewed every neighbor
in a mile radius

387
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,357
and we got a convicted finger-blaster

388
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,125
who just happened
to cut off his ankle bracelet.

389
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,257
- Take it easy...
- No, no, no, no, no!

390
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,324
Who the fuck is this guy?

391
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,968
You're here because Jack Doyle
had us extend you a courtesy.

You got something to contribute,
you know, be my guest.

Otherwise, hey, you...

00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,643
You know, you can go back
to your Harry Potter book.

395
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,607
Isn't it usually somebody
who knows the victim?

396
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:06,982
I think there's plenty of people
in Helene McCready's life

397
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,352
that are capable of doing this.

398
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:13,025
So then you probably
talked to Ray Likanski.

399
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:15,288
- Who?
- Ray Likanski.

400
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:19,856
"Skinny Ray," they call him, 6'2",
about 160 pounds.

Does blow. Helene's boyfriend. No?

402
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:26,605
- Never heard of him.
- Well, with all due respect,

403
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:28,835
I think we might be able
to contribute on that point.

404
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,504
- Really? How's that?
- The night Amanda went missing,

405
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,103
Skinny Ray was down
at the Fillmore Lounge

406
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:35,445
doing coke for two hours,
between 8:00 and 10:00.

407
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:36,882
Fascinating.

408
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:41,121
- With Helene McCready.
- You're shitting me.

409
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:45,155

Well, it all depends
on how you look at it.

416
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:07,613
I mean, you might think that you're
more from here than me, for example.

I know people like this?

00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:36,141
Bub, I know you don't pay your rent
doing people's taxes.

429
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:38,078
Yeah, I don't pay my rent
selling penny rocks

00:24:45,322 --> 00:24:48,655
The other two are just baseheads
he hangs out with.

at the Fillmore all night

while the kid was taken.

- With Skinny Ray.
- Skinny Ray is a fucking bitch.

439
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:01,665
- I thought Ray was your boy.
- Work for me?

440
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:04,739
Skinny Ray, he's a fucking cokehead.
He works for the Haitian.

441
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:06,071
Ray works for Cheese?

442
00:25:06,143 --> 00:25:10,705
Yeah, Cheese, Ray, Chris Mullen,
whole trash-picker crew.

443
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:12,442
Did you ever sell to Helene?

444
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,485
There's reasons why
there ain't three inches of Plexiglas

between us right now.

446
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:18,549
That's 'cause I don't fuck
with skeezers like Helene.

447
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:20,147
Or coconuts like Cheese.

448
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:21,248
You should know better by now.

449
00:25:21,325 --> 00:25:23,725
I'm the king of this
motherfucking jungle.

450
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:26,388
I'll let you know
if I hear anything, though.

No. No.

00:25:56,762 --> 00:25:59,162
Either you know him or you don't.

460
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:02,793
Who is he?

461
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:05,234
BEA: He's a drug lord
or something, isn't he?

462
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:06,965
Helene, who is he?

463
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,504
- He's just a guy, Lionel.
- REMY: Thank you.

464
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:13,102
He is, among other things,
Mrs. McCready, a drug dealer, yes.

465
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,114
- What other things?
- I don't know.

466
00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:18,047
BEA: Why don't you answer
your brother's questions, Helene?

467
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:19,675
Why don't you go
suck a nigger's dick, Bea?

468

You listen to me!
You don't disrespect my wife,

469
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,884
and you don't make racial remarks
in my kitchen.

470
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,322
- Who is this man?
- It's my kitchen, Lionel.

471
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:26,449
You know what I mean!

472

Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

473
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:31,229
He's a drug dealer, a pimp,
a pornographer. All right?

474
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:32,787
LIONEL: Perfect.
You associate with a pimp.

475
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:34,628
BEA: A pornographer? Helene.

476
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:36,965
NICK: And we think he rolled up
Pokey Jackson in a carpet

477
00:26:37,036 --> 00:26:39,664
and shot him in the head
on Castlegate, so there's that, too.

478
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,639
REMY: What do you do for him?

479

a habit out of it.

BEA: Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Lionel, what does that mean?

482
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,475
It means she's a drug runner, Bea.
It means she carries drugs.

483

- Isn't that right, Helene?
- Oh, my God, a few times.

You think I'm playing games, here?
'Course it matters.

LIONEL: Better answer
his question, Helene.

489
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,162
- For what?
- Fuck's sake, Lionel.

490
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,869
- What do you think? Money, taste.
- Of what, drugs?

No, little puffy heart stickers

NICK: Cocaine and heroin.

493

- No, I would've seen the track marks.
- Not if you snort it. Right, sugar?

494
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,220
Yeah, less addictive that way.

495
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:32,320
Piece of work.

00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:37,758
What the fuck is that?
Where are you going?

497
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:47,001
Oh, yeah.
I keep thinking about this thing I heard.

498
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,909
- You know where I'm going with this?
- No.

499

Did you know I used to work DCU?

00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:56,513

- Care to take a polygraph?
- I already took one.

You even give a fuck about your kid?

'Course I do.

514
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:42,863
And we know you took the money.
So just tell us how much you took.

515
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:44,264
How much?

516
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:49,903
How much?

517
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:52,937
How much?

518
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:56,575
One thirty.

Yeah.

We dropped four ki's on these bikers.

When we was walking back
through the motel with all the money,

these cops just swooped right in,
went right for the bikers,

so we just pretended to be like a family.

He stabbed a foreign exchange student

He got life in Walpole.

You and Ray went home after.

- No, it was a cartoon.

- Fuck youse both.

615

Should we bring in the FBI
at this point?

Fastest way to get Amanda home

623
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:58,141
is go to Cheese,
swap the money for her and walk away.

624

- Plain and simple.
- Do you know Cheese?

Knew his brother better, Jude.
He was a sweet kid.

- NICK: (CHUCKLES) Ask Ray.

All right, listen.
All he cares about is his money.

629
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:16,002
If he gets it back...
He's not gonna hurt Amanda.

630
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:19,598
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?
We'll get her back. It'll be fine.

631
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:21,972

- Yeah, that's the idea.

00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:24,204
Okay. Well, tell him I'm sorry, all right?

633
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:26,941
I mean, he knows me,
just tell him I apologize.

634
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:29,848
Yeah, I'm sure that'll fix everything.
Just take her home.

No, her.

That's what she said to me
right before I put her to bed.

640
00:35:39,695 --> 00:35:42,220
She said, "I'm hungry."
I mean, they fed her, right?

641
00:35:42,298 --> 00:35:44,357
She's not still hungry?

Detective Bressant was kind enough

by the edge with the money.

- Chris Mullen.

He was at the club
when we made the offer.

What do you know about him?

It was probably him
who killed Ray for Cheese.

for Amanda or is it better for us?

No, sir.

My only child was murdered.
She was 12. Did you hear about it?

What you probably didn't hear,

and what I hope
you never have to deal with,

826
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:59,155
Miss Gennaro, is what that feels like.
What I have to deal with.

827
00:48:00,024 --> 00:48:03,755
Knowing that my little girl likely died

828

crying out for me
to come and save her.

829
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:09,025
And I never did.

830
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:16,037
My little girl died afraid and alone
in a shallow ditch bank

831

by the side of the road
not 10 minutes from my house.

I honor my child with this division.

has to go through what I've known.

for never being found.

01:10:14,665 --> 01:10:17,065
We were paying $ 100
an eight-ball to snitches.

1080
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:19,830
We got a call
from our pal, Ray Likanski.

1081
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:22,167
He couldn't find enough guys to rat out.

1082
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:24,332
Anyway, he tells us there's a guy
pumping up in an apartment

1083
01:10:24,408 --> 01:10:26,535
up in Columbia Point.

1084
01:10:27,411 --> 01:10:29,436
We go in, me and Nicky.

1085
01:10:29,513 --> 01:10:33,813
Fifteen years ago, when Nicky went in,
it was no joke.

1086
01:10:34,184 --> 01:10:35,947
So, it's a... It's a stash house, right?

1087
01:10:36,019 --> 01:10:39,921
The old lady's beat to shit,
the husband's mean, cracked out,

1088
01:10:39,991 --> 01:10:43,688
tries to give us trouble,
Nicky lays him down.

1089
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:45,752
We're doing an inventory,
but it looks like we messed up

1090
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:49,163
because there's no dope in the house,
and I go in the back room...

1091
01:10:49,233 --> 01:10:52,760
Now, this place
was a shithole, mind you.

1092
01:10:52,837 --> 01:10:56,466
Rats, roaches all over the place.

1093
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:59,704
But the kid's room, in the back,

1094
01:11:01,012 --> 01:11:02,673
was spotless.

1095
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:07,708
No, I mean, he swept it, mopped it,
it was immaculate.

1096
01:11:09,387 --> 01:11:10,649
The little boy's sitting on the bed

1097
01:11:10,723 --> 01:11:14,181
holding onto his PlayStation
for dear life.

1098
01:11:14,259 --> 01:11:16,784
There's no expression on his face,

1099
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:20,560
tears streaming down.

1100
01:11:21,867 --> 01:11:25,769
He wants to tell me he just learned
his multiplication tables.

1101
01:11:25,838 --> 01:11:26,998
Christ.

1102
01:11:27,072 --> 01:11:29,666
I mean, the father's got him
in this crack den,

1103
01:11:29,742 --> 01:11:32,438
subsisting on Twinkies
and ass-whippings,

1104
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:38,143
and this little boy just wants someone
to tell him that he's doing a good job.

1105
01:11:40,219 --> 01:11:42,619
You're worried what's Catholic?

1106
01:11:42,688 --> 01:11:44,815
I mean, kids forgive.

1107
01:11:45,725 --> 01:11:49,058
Kids don't judge.

1108
01:11:49,129 --> 01:11:51,461
Kids turn the other cheek.

1109
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:54,430
What do they get for it?

1110
01:11:55,368 --> 01:11:56,699
So I went back out there,

1111
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,863
I put an ounce of heroin
on the living room floor,

1112
01:11:58,938 --> 01:12:02,305
and I sent the father on a ride,
seven to nine.

1113
01:12:05,545 --> 01:12:08,514
- That was the right thing?
- Fucking A!

1114
01:12:10,884 --> 01:12:12,977
You gotta take a side.

1115
01:12:14,921 --> 01:12:18,982
You molest a child, you beat a child,

1116
01:12:20,227 --> 01:12:21,751
you're not on my side.

1117
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:23,296
If you see me coming, you better run,

1118
01:12:23,364 --> 01:12:26,265
because I am gonna
lay you the fuck down!

1119
01:12:29,837 --> 01:12:31,361
Easy.

1120
01:12:37,511 --> 01:12:38,842
Don't feel easy.

1121
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,781
Is the kid better off without his father?

1122
01:12:42,616 --> 01:12:43,742
Yeah.

1123
01:12:45,519 --> 01:12:47,680
But okay, I mean,
could be out there right now,

1124
01:12:47,755 --> 01:12:50,280
pumping with a gun in his waistband.

1125
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,857
It's a war, man.

1126
01:12:54,229 --> 01:12:55,958
Are we winning?

1127
01:12:57,466 --> 01:12:59,058
No.

1128
01:13:04,973 --> 01:13:08,306
Would you do it again?
Clip Corwin Earle?

1129
01:13:10,912 --> 01:13:12,311
No.

1130
01:13:14,749 --> 01:13:16,944
Does that make you right?

1131
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:20,545
Hmm?

1132
01:13:20,622 --> 01:13:22,920
I don't know.

1133
01:13:22,992 --> 01:13:25,460
Doesn't make it wrong, though,
does it?

1134
01:13:33,069 --> 01:13:34,297
(SIGHS)

1135
01:13:42,245 --> 01:13:44,076
- Hey.
- Hi.

1136
01:13:46,415 --> 01:13:47,882
How's Remy?

1137
01:13:49,652 --> 01:13:51,142
He lied to me.

1138
01:13:52,655 --> 01:13:55,351
What did Remy say about Ray
back in Roxbury?

1139
01:13:55,425 --> 01:13:57,256
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of him.

1140
01:13:57,327 --> 01:14:00,387
Now he says Ray's been snitching
for him for 15 years.

1141
01:14:00,664 --> 01:14:02,655
He called him his "old pal."

1142
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:05,600
Said he couldn't find
enough people to snitch out.

1143
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:06,897
Patrick...

1144
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:09,962
And Ray Likanski is the reason
Amanda got taken in the first place,

1145
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,201
and Remy lies about knowing him.

1146
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:16,769
Let it go.

1147
01:14:16,847 --> 01:14:19,372
Why would he lie?
What's he have to hide?

1148
01:14:19,449 --> 01:14:21,474
Amanda's dead.

1149
01:14:21,985 --> 01:14:23,646
Let it go.

Nick died.

01:14:48,913 --> 01:14:51,814
Left. Left.

Mr. Kenzie.

1155
01:15:00,592 --> 01:15:03,117
Nice fucking job on Corwin Earle.

(PRAYING IN LATIN)

1157
01:15:16,342 --> 01:15:19,038
Amen.

(PRAYING IN LATIN)

1159
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:57,544
- Sorry about Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1160
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:03,211
I was thinking about our conversation
the other night.

1161
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:05,450
Well, I said some things
I shouldn't have.

1162
01:16:05,525 --> 01:16:08,119
You know, too much rum.

1163
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:09,890
Yeah, like what?

1164
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:14,366
Don't fuck with me, Patrick. Not today.

1165
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:17,803
Oh, I wouldn't fuck with you.

1166
01:16:18,806 --> 01:16:22,867
Oh, you wanna play it like that, huh?
Okay.

1167
01:16:24,278 --> 01:16:27,736
Forget about the other night,
and we'll be friends.

1168
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:31,543
What if I don't?

1169
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:35,077
That's not an "if"
you wanna bring into your life.

1170
01:16:38,225 --> 01:16:39,624
MAN: Had lunch with him last week.

1171
01:16:39,694 --> 01:16:40,854
Dana had lunch with him last week?

1172
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,396
Excuse me.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,191
Hey, Dev.

1175
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:49,103
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right, how you been?

1176
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:51,298
I can't complain.

1177
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:53,807
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

1178
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,675
Not here.

1179
01:16:56,745 --> 01:17:00,146
(SCOFFS) If it's like that, then
you're gonna have to buy me lunch.

1180
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:03,912
- How's the Chart House, half hour?
- Sounds about right.

1181
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,754
Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics
with you, right?

1182
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:09,518
DCU, yeah. What's up?

1183
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,115
Why'd he leave?

1184
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:14,754
Had a habit of just
rubbing people the wrong way.

1185
01:17:14,831 --> 01:17:16,890
Like what? What'd he do?

1186
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:19,434
Like marry a prostitute, for one.

1187
01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:20,594
Come on.

1188
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,365
Might not wanna do that
if you're a cop, right?

1189
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:24,030
Might not wanna do that
if you're a plumber.

(LAUGHING)

1191
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:27,904
So, what happened?

1192
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,673
He says he loves her,
tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,

1193
01:17:30,747 --> 01:17:31,839
and puts in for a transfer.

1194
01:17:31,914 --> 01:17:32,938
What, to Doyle?

1195
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:36,712
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana, back in '72.

1196
01:17:36,786 --> 01:17:40,222
You don't think that Remy's
dirty, though, do you?

01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:42,154
What's "dirty"?

1198
01:17:43,726 --> 01:17:47,025
- I know he planted evidence once.
- Oh, you do?

1199
01:17:48,632 --> 01:17:50,566
Yeah. Why?

Look, man. CSI is killing us out here.

Every other juror, all they wanna know
is where the microfibers are.

Certain people are workers.

1203
01:17:58,742 --> 01:18:00,369
Don't wanna plant it,
but you know how it is.

1204
01:18:00,444 --> 01:18:02,605
So they don't mind it.

1205
01:18:04,615 --> 01:18:08,244
So tell me something,
what you fucking with him for?

1206
01:18:09,787 --> 01:18:12,187
He lied to me.

1207
01:18:12,256 --> 01:18:14,520
I can't think of one reason
big enough for him to lie

1208
01:18:14,591 --> 01:18:17,219
that's small enough not to matter.

1209
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,861
All right, look.

1210
01:18:23,935 --> 01:18:28,395
I know one thing, but it's third party,
so you gotta play it like that.

1211

Helene and Ray took Cheese's money
back in June, right?

Yeah.

1213
01:18:32,677 --> 01:18:35,646
One week later,
Remy goes to a cop in DCU

1214
01:18:35,713 --> 01:18:38,181
asking if anybody knew
who robbed Cheese.

1215
01:18:38,249 --> 01:18:39,443
So what?

1216
01:18:39,517 --> 01:18:41,280
So my informant tells me,

1217
01:18:41,352 --> 01:18:44,879
Cheese didn't even know
he got robbed until two weeks later.

1218
01:18:45,156 --> 01:18:48,023
So Remy knew Cheese got robbed
before Cheese did?

1219
01:18:48,092 --> 01:18:49,992
How'd he know that?

1220
01:18:51,162 --> 01:18:52,959
Let me tell you something.

1221
01:18:53,032 --> 01:18:54,090
You better think long and hard

1222
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:57,158
before you start running around here
investigating the police.

1223
01:18:57,236 --> 01:19:02,071
You try and take food out their mouths,
and they will fuck you up.

1224
01:19:04,677 --> 01:19:06,577
Thanks for the steak.

1225
01:19:07,246 --> 01:19:08,975
All right.

1226
01:19:22,394 --> 01:19:23,793
Hey.

1227
01:19:25,832 --> 01:19:27,322

LIONEL ON PHONE:
About what?

1230
01:19:31,471 --> 01:19:34,201
About the acoustics in your apartment.

01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:35,832
What?

1232
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:37,809
Oh, we live
in a three-decker, too, Lionel.

1233
01:19:37,878 --> 01:19:39,743
I got nothing to talk about.

1234
01:19:39,813 --> 01:19:42,907
Well, that's fine.
We can talk to the state police.

Meet me at Murphy's Law.

01:20:04,605 --> 01:20:06,129
LIONEL ON PHONE: I don't meet him
down Murphy's,

1237
01:20:06,207 --> 01:20:07,504
he's gonna call the staties.

1238
01:20:07,575 --> 01:20:09,941
REMY ON PHONE: He's putting a
move on you. Don't go down there.

1239
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:12,102
I can handle Patrick Kenzie.

1240
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:13,874
- This is an oath we took.
- I started this.

1241
01:20:13,948 --> 01:20:15,916
- This has to be protected.
- I got things to protect, too.

1242
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:17,075
- Listen to me!
- All right, Remy.

1243
01:20:17,151 --> 01:20:19,517
You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me.

1244
01:20:19,587 --> 01:20:21,919
- Just trust me, all right?
- No! Trust me!

1245
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:26,653
Where I come from,
you die with your secrets!

1246
01:20:52,888 --> 01:20:55,322
How long have you known Remy?

1247
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:58,518
Detective Bressant? Just in...

1248
01:20:58,593 --> 01:21:01,858
Met him through
the investigation of Amanda.

1249
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:03,898
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1250
01:21:07,303 --> 01:21:09,464
How long you known Remy?

1251
01:21:10,506 --> 01:21:11,700
What is this?

1252
01:21:11,774 --> 01:21:14,743
They got the Internet, now, Lionel.

1253
01:21:14,811 --> 01:21:17,177
You know how it is in town.
Everybody knows everybody.

1254
01:21:17,246 --> 01:21:19,714
No. Everybody don't know everybody.

1255
01:21:19,782 --> 01:21:21,409
- What're you talking about?
- Why you lying?

1256
01:21:21,484 --> 01:21:22,473
I'm not.

1257
01:21:22,552 --> 01:21:25,316
You bragged about taking a hard bust
on the first day we met you.

1258
01:21:25,388 --> 01:21:26,946
- No, I didn't.
- Bullshit.

1259
01:21:27,023 --> 01:21:29,514
You're hiding something, Lionel,
and you better fucking tell it,

1260
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:32,527
'cause you came to our house
and you asked us for help.

1261
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:34,825
And we killed ourselves
trying to save Amanda.

1262
01:21:34,897 --> 01:21:36,728
And I know you ain't being 100%
with me right now,

1263
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,734
and it's really fucking pissing me off
that you're lying,

1264
01:21:38,802 --> 01:21:41,270
so you better interrupt me at any time,
'cause I'm about to lose...

1265
01:21:41,338 --> 01:21:44,239
Okay. Fine, fine. All right?
Don't have a heart attack.

1266
01:21:45,409 --> 01:21:47,536
I haven't been honest with you.

1267
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,580
It's just not something I'm proud of.
You know?

1268
01:21:50,647 --> 01:21:53,514
I got in a bar fight back in the day.

1269
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:54,812
The other guy cracked his skull.

1270
01:21:54,885 --> 01:21:57,376
At some point,
I must've said, "I'll kill you."

1271
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:01,823
So they had me up for attempted.
It's my word against this other guy's.

1272
01:22:01,892 --> 01:22:04,656
Witness testified to my version
and the jury believed him.

1273
01:22:04,728 --> 01:22:07,629
- 'Cause he was a cop.
- Yeah, he testified for me.

1274
01:22:07,698 --> 01:22:09,359
So you knew Detective Bressant.

1275
01:22:09,434 --> 01:22:11,732
- It's not like we were best friends.
- But you lied.

1276
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:15,034
- Why did you call Remy?
- He's a cop.

1277
01:22:15,106 --> 01:22:16,971
- That's not why you called him, Lionel.
- Come on.

1278
01:22:17,042 --> 01:22:18,907
It's a small place.
You heard them arguing.

1279
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:20,569
- They were being loud.
- Who? Who... Who...

1280
01:22:20,645 --> 01:22:25,048
So you called Remy, and you and him
took Amanda to blackmail your sister.

1281
01:22:25,116 --> 01:22:26,481
(SCOFFS)

1282
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:29,848
Why would I do that?

1283
01:22:29,921 --> 01:22:32,947
I don't know, Lionel. I really don't know.

1284
01:22:33,024 --> 01:22:36,016
Maybe because after all the
"I put the fucking plug in the jug,"

1285
01:22:36,094 --> 01:22:38,085
and the "count your blessings"
and the "watch your language,"

1286
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:40,324
you're just like everybody else.

1287
01:22:40,398 --> 01:22:42,298
You saw a bag of money
and you wanted it.

1288
01:22:42,368 --> 01:22:43,960
And you thought
you could get away with it.

1289
01:22:44,036 --> 01:22:46,163
But Bea called the media
and made a big thing of it.

1290
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:48,604
And then she called us,
and then you were fucked.

1291
01:22:48,674 --> 01:22:50,801
The case is closed, Patrick.
The case is closed.

1292
01:22:50,876 --> 01:22:53,174
Coke-dealing Haitian's
a pretty easy target for a frame.

1293
01:22:53,245 --> 01:22:54,542
- Lionel?
- Excuse me.

1294
01:22:54,613 --> 01:22:55,671
- Look at me.
- Okay. Excuse me.

1295
01:22:55,748 --> 01:22:57,375
You took your niece,
and you laid it off on a black guy.

1296
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:58,678
- Pardon me.
- Lionel, tell me what happened.

1297
01:22:58,751 --> 01:23:00,878
Can I get some service?

1298
01:23:00,953 --> 01:23:02,318
Yeah.

1299
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,524
(EXHALES)

1300
01:23:09,095 --> 01:23:10,494
What?

1301
01:23:12,098 --> 01:23:15,226
- Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.
- Yeah.

1302
01:23:15,302 --> 01:23:16,792
Thank you.

1303
01:23:18,105 --> 01:23:20,130
Just give me a second.

1304
01:23:51,405 --> 01:23:54,340
Twenty-three years
is something, right?

1305
01:24:06,954 --> 01:24:08,353
Go.

1306
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:15,657
I come up to check on Amanda.
She was alone as usual.

1307
01:24:17,932 --> 01:24:20,457
I was reading her a story
when Helene and Ray come home.

1308
01:24:20,535 --> 01:24:21,627
They didn't know I was there.

1309
01:24:21,703 --> 01:24:25,230
Stop fucking yelling,
my daughter's sleeping in there.

1310
01:24:25,307 --> 01:24:26,865
(ARGUING)

1311
01:24:27,376 --> 01:24:30,004
They started talking about how
they'd robbed this drug dealer.

1312
01:24:30,078 --> 01:24:32,171
You know what he's fucking gonna do
if he finds out?

1313
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:34,010
What's the monkey gonna do?

1314
01:24:34,082 --> 01:24:35,413
- Oh, you know...
- I'm not...

1315
01:24:35,484 --> 01:24:38,647
And they were talking
about leaving the state.

1316
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,187
So I called Remy and told him.

1317
01:24:40,255 --> 01:24:42,917
There's another drug run
up to Nashua. Taking cocaine...

1318
01:24:42,991 --> 01:24:44,652
And then what?

1319
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:49,556
We took her.

1320
01:24:52,401 --> 01:24:55,131
Remy laid out this plan.
It seemed easy.

1321
01:24:55,205 --> 01:24:58,072
We take her, force Helene and Ray
to cough up the cash,

1322
01:24:58,141 --> 01:25:00,166
then we put her back. You know?

1323
01:25:00,243 --> 01:25:02,302
Amanda gets to spend
a weekend in the country.

1324
01:25:02,378 --> 01:25:03,902
My sister learns a lesson.

1325
01:25:04,247 --> 01:25:07,011
And fuck it, everybody gets paid
on top of it.

1326
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:10,052
I got no problem taking money
from a guy like Cheese.

1327
01:25:10,119 --> 01:25:11,677
They were gonna handle the cops.

1328
01:25:11,754 --> 01:25:13,984
But Bea, she went nuts.

1329
01:25:14,057 --> 01:25:16,617
Started calling the papers. Hired you.

1330
01:25:16,693 --> 01:25:19,025
Lionel don't want me coming here,
now you don't want the job?

1331
01:25:19,095 --> 01:25:23,088
But once you found the money,
they had Amanda and the money.

1332
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:27,296
So they decided to set up
a fake exchange for you to witness.

1333
01:25:27,371 --> 01:25:30,033
They got Chris Mullen
to set up Cheese at the quarry.

1334
01:25:30,107 --> 01:25:33,702
15K and a chance to be the boss.

1335
01:25:36,513 --> 01:25:38,811
Cheese figured out
what was happening.

1336
01:25:38,882 --> 01:25:42,340
Even though it was too late,
he started shooting.

1337
01:25:42,419 --> 01:25:44,353
Panicking.

1338
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:49,323
And she just fell. I mean, she just...

1339
01:25:49,393 --> 01:25:51,054
She fell in.

1340
01:25:52,529 --> 01:25:54,156
She's gone.

1341
01:25:54,231 --> 01:25:56,426
It was an accident.
It was just an accident.

1342
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,695
She was your sister's kid, Lionel.

1343
01:26:00,605 --> 01:26:04,268
- Your sister's child.
- You think I don't miss her?

1344
01:26:04,342 --> 01:26:06,902
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1345
01:26:08,013 --> 01:26:12,109
Last summer, Helene and Dottie
took Amanda to the beach.

1346
01:26:12,284 --> 01:26:16,414
It was a real hot day.
Amanda fell asleep.

1347
01:26:16,855 --> 01:26:19,380
They left her in the car
while they go off into the dunes,

1348
01:26:19,457 --> 01:26:21,220
smoke a doobie with some guys.

1349
01:26:21,293 --> 01:26:23,022
Two hours.

1350
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:27,459
Amanda literally roasted.

1351
01:26:28,733 --> 01:26:30,223
She was three.

1352
01:26:33,005 --> 01:26:37,271
Later on, I was holding her,
trying to help her get to sleep.

1353
01:26:38,311 --> 01:26:42,975
My little Amanda, she was so hot.

1354
01:26:45,217 --> 01:26:48,186
She felt like something
just come out of the oven.

1355
01:26:49,522 --> 01:26:51,820
Like a fucking pot roast.

1356
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,291
So don't feel too sorry for my sister.

1357
01:26:56,362 --> 01:27:00,128
Because she never gave a shit
about anyone but herself.

- I didn't say nothing.

01:28:23,051 --> 01:28:24,916
Are you all right?

1388
01:28:24,987 --> 01:28:26,011
(PANTING)

1389
01:28:26,088 --> 01:28:27,112
Stay with him.

1390
01:29:29,487 --> 01:29:31,250
Drop your gun.

1391
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:34,685
Put it down!

1392
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:42,922
That bartender wasn't fucking around.

1393
01:29:52,577 --> 01:29:54,101
What did you do?

1394
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:56,470
Did you get her killed?

1395
01:29:59,351 --> 01:30:01,046
Say yes.

1396
01:30:06,024 --> 01:30:07,355
Say yes.

1397
01:30:08,293 --> 01:30:09,760
Say yes!

1398
01:30:10,662 --> 01:30:14,826
What're you gonna do? Shoot me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1399
01:30:22,674 --> 01:30:24,699
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1400
01:30:29,181 --> 01:30:31,206
She was a child.

1401
01:30:33,352 --> 01:30:35,252
I love children.

1402
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:15,687
Why would I expose a conspiracy
that I was a part of?

1403
01:31:17,097 --> 01:31:20,624
I mean, did Lionel contradict
anything I've said?

1404
01:31:21,868 --> 01:31:25,099
Did any of the witnesses at the bar
contradict anything I've said?

1405
01:31:25,172 --> 01:31:28,835
A police officer was killed today.
That's not looked on lightly.

1406
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:31,105
Is corruption looked on lightly?

1407
01:31:31,179 --> 01:31:32,840
Is a little girl getting killed
looked on lightly?

1408
01:31:32,914 --> 01:31:34,142
OFFICER: Whoa, hold on.

1409
01:31:34,215 --> 01:31:36,649
You charge people money
as a detective.

1410
01:31:36,718 --> 01:31:40,654
Now, you're at the quarry
the other night, right?

1411
01:31:40,722 --> 01:31:43,657
And you have no idea
that this is a setup?

1412
01:31:43,725 --> 01:31:46,125
You're baffled. Right?

1413
01:31:47,662 --> 01:31:52,122
No, because, strange as it might seem,

1414
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,431
I believe the police
when they tell me something.

1415
01:31:56,137 --> 01:31:57,365
You're a fresh prick. You know that?

1416
01:31:57,438 --> 01:31:59,668
And because I had a ransom note
and Amanda McCready's blanket

1417
01:31:59,741 --> 01:32:00,833
put in my mailbox.

1418
01:32:00,908 --> 01:32:03,934
And because I read a transcript of
a call that Cheese put into the station.

1419
01:32:04,013 --> 01:32:05,105
A 911 call?

1420
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:08,240
No, it was a call
Cheese made to the station.

1421
01:32:08,317 --> 01:32:09,614
To Remy Bressant at the station.

1422
01:32:09,685 --> 01:32:11,744
Or that Chris Mullen made,
pretending to be Cheese.

1423
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:13,617
Or whatever the fuck it was,
but it was recorded,

1424
01:32:13,689 --> 01:32:15,589
and there was a call.

1425
01:32:15,658 --> 01:32:17,592
We don't record calls
coming into the station,

1426
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:20,458
and we don't do transcripts, smart guy.

1427
01:32:22,564 --> 01:32:25,124
OFFICER: So, did you hear a tape?

1428
01:32:26,502 --> 01:32:28,800
- No, I didn't hear a tape.
- Okay.

1429
01:32:28,871 --> 01:32:31,101
Did you see a transcript?

1430
01:32:35,845 --> 01:32:38,405
No, I must've remembered it wrong.

1431
01:32:48,658 --> 01:32:50,125
Kids forgive.

1432
01:32:50,193 --> 01:32:51,683
What do they get for it?

1433
01:32:51,761 --> 01:32:54,195
Amanda literally roasted.

1434
01:33:03,506 --> 01:33:04,700
LIONEL: You think I don't miss her.

1435
01:33:04,774 --> 01:33:07,208
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1436
01:33:07,277 --> 01:33:09,404
I love children.

1437
01:33:13,918 --> 01:33:18,150
This is the kind of thing that if you do,
Patrick, you wanna be sure.

1438
01:33:20,424 --> 01:33:22,153
Are you sure?

1439
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:24,259
No.

1440
01:33:28,099 --> 01:33:29,964
Are you coming?

1441
01:33:30,601 --> 01:33:31,898
No.

1442
01:33:43,548 --> 01:33:46,278
DEVIN: Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana back in '72.

1443
01:33:46,351 --> 01:33:49,047
JACK: Care to read
the highlighted portion?

1444
01:34:00,732 --> 01:34:03,064
Taking a trip?

1445
01:34:03,135 --> 01:34:04,898
Patrick Kenzie.

1446
01:34:06,505 --> 01:34:09,303
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1447
01:34:09,374 --> 01:34:12,002
Remy Bressant died last night.

1448
01:34:12,544 --> 01:34:15,570
I was told. It's a shame.

1449
01:34:17,016 --> 01:34:21,612
Yeah, it's hard to understand.
Because he seemed like a good man.

1450
01:34:21,687 --> 01:34:23,518
He was a good man.

1451
01:34:24,857 --> 01:34:27,519
We don't know
why people do what they do.

1452
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:30,192
Everybody looks out his own window.

1453
01:34:30,429 --> 01:34:32,590
And everyone's got their reasons.

1454
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,124
(DOOR OPENS)

1455
01:34:43,009 --> 01:34:44,704
- Hey.
- Hi.

1456
01:34:44,777 --> 01:34:46,074
- How are you?
- Good.

1457
01:34:46,145 --> 01:34:48,204
REMY: Nick! They're firing at me.

1458
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:49,977
Nick, you hear me? You okay?
They're firing at me!

1459
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,210
NICK: Remy!

1460
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:53,549
- I heard something go in the water!
- Ambush! Ambush!

1461
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:56,521
- Something went in!
- Run. Remy. Run!

1462
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,588
LIONEL: Panicking.

1463
01:34:58,659 --> 01:35:01,492
Amanda got scared.
She started running.

1464
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:04,497
She just fell. I mean, she just fell in.

1465
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:10,096
WOMAN ON TV: Twenty-nine-year-old
Chris Mullen

1466
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:11,603
was gunned down last night

1467
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:12,934
in an apparent robbery.

1468
01:35:13,006 --> 01:35:16,134
You go back inside with Frannie.
Papa will come in soon.

1469
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:17,370
Make you a sandwich, okay?

1470
01:35:17,444 --> 01:35:18,672
- All right.
- That's my girl.

1471
01:35:18,745 --> 01:35:19,769
REMY: Don't go down there.

1472
01:35:19,848 --> 01:35:21,543
If I think he has the evidence,
I'll take the hit.

1473
01:35:21,616 --> 01:35:22,742
I got no problem doing the time.

1474
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:25,251
Fuck up, and it's Amanda and her life.

1475
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,651
JACK: All right.
LIONEL: I got things to protect, too.

1476
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,985
REMY: You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me

1477
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:30,251
and you're a danger to Amanda.

1478
01:35:30,325 --> 01:35:32,452
Please, I told him
we took her for ransom. I did it.

1479
01:35:32,527 --> 01:35:34,586
I told him. Remy, please.

1480
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:35,959
(GUN FIRING)

1481
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:40,996
So now you know.

1482
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:44,361
LIONEL: My sister's not stable.
She's on crack.

1483
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:46,532
She's talking about leaving the state.
I'm scared for my niece.

1484
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:48,803
- Who's gonna take care of her?
- We'll do something.

1485
01:35:48,877 --> 01:35:51,004
REMY: We'll figure it out.
She's an addict.

1486
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,637
Bigot. Drug mule.

1487
01:35:52,715 --> 01:35:55,775
The child will be dead
or on the street in 10 years.

1488
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:58,513
JACK: What about the uncle?
REMY: He can never tell anyone.

1489
01:35:58,587 --> 01:36:01,988
Not even his wife.
Or he'll never see her again.

1490
01:36:02,057 --> 01:36:06,050
It's worth it to him.
Know she'll have a better life.

1491
01:36:06,128 --> 01:36:09,120
Do one last good thing
before we hang it up.

1492
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:13,960
JACK: How many children
have we seen destroyed?

1493
01:36:14,937 --> 01:36:16,234
REMY: Enough.

1494
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,837
Does it make you feel better?

1495
01:36:20,743 --> 01:36:24,076
Telling yourself you did it
for the right reasons?

1496
01:36:24,146 --> 01:36:26,478
That you took her to be saved.

1497
01:36:26,549 --> 01:36:28,414
From her own mother?

1498
01:36:30,587 --> 01:36:33,784
We're just trying to give
a little girl a life.

1499
01:36:35,025 --> 01:36:38,358
Wasn't your life to give.
Helene's her mother.

1500
01:36:38,428 --> 01:36:41,158
If you thought she was a bad mother,
you should've gone to Social Services.

1501
01:36:41,231 --> 01:36:45,167
Short of that, she's her mother,
and that's where she belongs.

1502
01:36:46,569 --> 01:36:48,594
You turn around.

1503
01:36:48,672 --> 01:36:52,870
You go back to your fucking car,
and you wait 30 years.

1504
01:36:54,344 --> 01:36:56,835
You don't know
what the world is made of yet.

1505
01:36:59,116 --> 01:37:02,210
I'm calling state police in five minutes.
They'll be here in ten.

1506
01:37:02,286 --> 01:37:05,050
Thought you would've
done that by now.

1507
01:37:07,391 --> 01:37:09,621
You know why you haven't?

1508
01:37:11,529 --> 01:37:15,465
Because you think
this might be an irreparable mistake.

1509
01:37:15,533 --> 01:37:20,197
Because deep inside you, you know
it doesn't matter what the rules say.

1510
01:37:20,271 --> 01:37:22,330
When the lights go out
and you ask yourself,

1511
01:37:22,406 --> 01:37:26,308
"Is she better off here or better off
there," you know the answer.

1512
01:37:26,377 --> 01:37:28,368
And you always will.

1513
01:37:30,247 --> 01:37:35,310
You... You could do a right thing here.

1514
01:37:35,387 --> 01:37:37,116
A good thing.

1515
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:40,258
Men live their whole lives
without getting this chance.

1516
01:37:40,325 --> 01:37:42,225
You walk away from it,

1517
01:37:42,294 --> 01:37:44,592
you may not regret it
when you get home.

1518
01:37:44,663 --> 01:37:46,028
You may not regret it for a year,

1519
01:37:46,098 --> 01:37:49,761
but when you get to where I am,
I promise you, you will.

1520
01:37:51,103 --> 01:37:55,005
I'll be dead, you'll be old. But she...

1521
01:37:56,108 --> 01:38:00,272
She'll be dragging around a couple of
tattered, damaged children of her own,

1522
01:38:01,513 --> 01:38:04,880
and you'll be the one
who has to tell them you're sorry.

1523
01:38:05,885 --> 01:38:08,080
You know what? Maybe that'll happen.

1524
01:38:08,154 --> 01:38:12,318
And if it does, I'll tell them I'm sorry,
and I'll live with it.

1525
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,856
But what's never gonna happen
and what I'm not gonna do

1526
01:38:16,929 --> 01:38:18,658
is have to apologize
to a grown woman

1527
01:38:18,731 --> 01:38:19,789
who comes to me and says,

1528
01:38:19,866 --> 01:38:21,959
"I was kidnapped
when I was a little girl,

1529
01:38:22,035 --> 01:38:24,265
"and my aunt hired you to find me.

1530
01:38:24,337 --> 01:38:27,898
"And you did, you found me
with some strange family.

1531
01:38:27,974 --> 01:38:30,772
"But you broke your promise
and you left me there.

1532
01:38:30,843 --> 01:38:33,710
"Why? Why didn't you bring me home?

1533
01:38:34,981 --> 01:38:38,644
"Because all the snacks and the outfits
and the family trips don't matter.

1534
01:38:40,387 --> 01:38:42,947
"They stole me.

1535
01:38:43,023 --> 01:38:46,754
"It wasn't my family
and you knew about it

1536
01:38:46,827 --> 01:38:50,024
"and you knew better
and you did nothing."

1537
01:38:51,765 --> 01:38:53,289
And maybe that grown woman
will forgive me,

1538
01:38:53,367 --> 01:38:55,835
but I'll never forgive myself.

1539
01:39:00,007 --> 01:39:04,740
