00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,919
I'm 18 years old

164
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,959
and I had a touch of osteosarcoma
about a year-and-a-half ago.

165
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,087
So, I've lost this baby
as a result.

166
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,919
And, uh, now I'm part
cyborg, which is awesome.

167
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,399
But, really, I'm just
here at Isaac's request.

168
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,119
And how are you feeling, Gus?

169
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,079
I'm grand, yeah.

170
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,887
I'm on a roller coaster that
only goes up, my friend.

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,719
Maybe you'd like to share
your fears with the group?

172
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,731
GUS: My fears?

173
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,759
Oblivion.

174
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,919
PATRICK: Oblivion?

175
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,279
GUS: Yeah.

176
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,839
You see, I intend to live
an extraordinary life.

177
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,439
To be remembered.

178
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,639
So, I'd say if I have any fears,

179
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,368
it would be to not do that.

180
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,762
Would anyone else in the
group like to speak to that?

181
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,679
Hazel?
(CHUCKLES)

182
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,884
Unexpected.

183
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,239
I just want to say
that there's gonna

184
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,319
come a time when
all of us are dead.

185
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,959
There was a time before humans

186
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,759
and there's gonna be a time after.

187
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,119
It could be tomorrow, it could
be a million years from now.

188
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,159
And when it does,
there will be no one left...

189
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,639
to remember Cleopatra or
Muhammad Ali or Mozart...

190
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,129
let alone any of us.

191
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,719
Oblivion's inevitable.

192
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,448
And if that scares you, then
I suggest you ignore it.

193
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,604
God knows it's what
everyone else does.

194
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
(EXHALES)

195
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,970
Well, that's some good advice.

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,288
And I like all this because it's
really nice to hear everybody...

197
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,284
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

198
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,925
- Always.
- Always.

199
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,645
- MONICA: Always.
- ISAAC: Always.

200
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,803
"Literally."

201
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,759
I thought we were
in a church basement...

202
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,399
but apparently we were literally
in the heart of Jesus.

203
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,729
Oh, yeah.
(LAUGHS)

204
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,039
What's your name?

205
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,559
Hazel.

206
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,559
No, what's your full name?

207
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,049
Hazel Grace Lancaster.

208
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,359
What?

209
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,439
I didn't say anything.

210
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,559
Why are you looking
at me like that?

211
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,279
Because you're beautiful.

212
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,399
Oh, my God.

213
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,128
I enjoy looking
at beautiful people.

214
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,719
- (STAMMERING)
- See, I decided a while back...

215
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,279
not to deny myself the simpler
pleasures of existence.

216
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,039
Particularly, as you
so astutely pointed out,

217
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,399
we're all gonna die pretty soon.

218
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,759
Okay, well, that's great.
But I am not beautiful.

219
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,879
Hey, Gus.

220
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,527
Hi, Lisa.

221
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,799
ISAAC:
I like it when you say it first.

222
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,879
MONICA:
I like it when you say it first.

223
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,079
Okay.

224
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,559
Always.

225
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,079
- Always.
- (LAUGHS)

226
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,719
What is with the "always"?

227
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,319
"Always" is, like, their thing.

228
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,526
They'll "always" love
each other, and whatnot.

229
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,847
They probably texted "always" to each
other 14 million times this year.

230
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,846
He's got to be hurting her boob.

231
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,639
Let's go watch a movie.

232
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,119
- What?
- Hmm?

233
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,599
Huh?

234
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,567
(LAUGHS) Um...

235
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,839
I'm free later this week,
we could...

236
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,885
No, I mean now.

237
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,839
You could be an axe murderer.

238
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,959
There's always that possibility.

239
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,239
Come on, Hazel Grace.
Take a risk.

240
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,887
I don't...

241
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,799
Really?

242
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,519
That is disgusting.

243
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,599
What?

244
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,119
What, do you think that
that's cool or something?

245
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,479
You just ruined this whole thing.

246
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,319
- The whole thing?
- Yes, this whole thing!

247
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,879
Oh, man.

248
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,279
Ugh. And you were
doing really well, too.

249
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,159
God! There's always
a hamartia, isn't there?

250
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,479
And yours is even though
you had freaking cancer...

251
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,319
you're willing to give
money to a corporation...

252
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,959
for the chance to acquire
even more cancer?

253
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,839
Let me just tell you that not
being able to breathe sucks!

254
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,479
It totally sucks.

255
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,241
"Hamartia"?

256
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,519
It's a fatal flaw.

257
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,319
Ah, a fatal...

258
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,399
Hazel Grace,

259
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,923
they don't actually hurt
you unless you light them.

260
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,639
Hmm?

261
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,730
I've never lit one.

262
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,319
It's a metaphor, see?

263
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,083
You put the thing that does the
killing right between your teeth...

264
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,721
but you never give it
the power to kill you.

265
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,919
A metaphor.

266
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,010
(CAR APPROACHING)

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,651
Hey, sweetheart.
Is it <i>Top Model</i> time?

00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,519
No. Uh...

269
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,770
I've made plans
with Augustus Waters.

270

Ooh!

273
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,199
Yeah, I failed my test
a couple times.

274
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,559
You don't say.

275
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,119
Actually, the fourth time
I took the test,

276
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,079
it was going about
how this is going.

277
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,999
And when it was over...

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,399
the instructor looks over
at me, and she says...

279
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,079
"Your driving, while unpleasant,
is not technically unsafe."

280
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,159
Cancer perk.

281
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,489
- Total cancer perk.
- (LAUGHS)

282
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,159
So, tell me about you.

283

"The Miracle."

Of course, my lungs still
suck at being lungs...

continue to suck like this...

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,839
"which you might publish or
otherwise share on the internet.

647
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,119
"Not that I don't trust you,
but how could I trust you?

648
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,721
"I barely know you.

649
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,839
"Should ever you find
yourself in Amsterdam,

650
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,408
"do pay a visit at your leisure."

651
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,679
What?

652
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,965
"Yours most sincerely,
Peter Van Houten."

653
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,119
(CHUCKLES)

654
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,319
Oh, my God!

655
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,519
What is this life?

656
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,439
FRANNIE: Hazel?

657
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,839
- Mom!
- Hazel, what's wrong?

658
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,999
Mom, look at this.

659
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,648
Come here. Come here, come here.

660
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,486
Look.

661
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,519
- (GASPS) What?
- Yeah.

662
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,326
Peter Van Houten!

663
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,039
Look what he said!

664
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,359
"Should ever you find
yourself in Amsterdam"!

665
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,639
I have to go!

666
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,719
That's incredible.

667
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,399
He invited us to Amsterdam.

668
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,559
Amsterdam!

669
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,719
- Wow!
- Can we go?

670
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,721
I mean, do you think
we could actually go?

671
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,039
I mean, Amsterdam!

672
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,879
I want you to have everything
you want in the world.

673
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,239
But we don't have
the money, you know?

674
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,519
Just getting all the
equipment over there.

675
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,159
How do we do that?

676
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,491
Yeah, duh. I'm sorry.

677
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,084
Hey, you, I am so sorry.

678
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,930
It's okay.

679
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,439
Why don't you just ask
the Genies? Use your wish.

680
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,359
I already used it.
Pre-Miracle.

681
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,371
What'd you use it on?

682
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,569
Not Disney.

683
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,799
Hazel Grace, you did not
go to Disney World.

684
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,119
- You did not use your last dying wish...
- I was 13.

685
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,399
to go to Disney World.

686
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,679
And Epcot Center.

687
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,959
Oh, my God.

688
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,639
It was actually a really fun trip!

689
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,839
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

690
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,079
I met Goofy!

691
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,279
Now I'm just embarrassed.

692
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,479
Why are you embarrassed?

693
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,279
I can't believe I have a crush on
a girl with such cliche wishes.

694
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,564
Terrible.

695
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,206
You coming?

696
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,679
<i>HAZEL: The most important
thing in any MRI...</i>

697
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,408
<i>is to lie completely still.</i>

698
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,284
<i>But that day,
it was almost impossible.</i>

699
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,639
Hey, Gus! How are you?

700
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,605
Hi, Mrs. Lancaster.

701
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,159
Hey. Rik Smits jersey?

702
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,639
- Yeah, it is indeed.
- I loved that guy.

703
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,799
I'm Augustus Waters.

704
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,289
Nice to meet you.
I'm Michael.

705
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,359
- It's good to see you.
- Hi, Mrs. Lancaster.

706
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,042
Good to see you.

707
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,479
Hi, Hazel Grace.

708
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,159
Hi.

709
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,762
How would you like to go
on a picnic with me?

710
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,808
Um, I would love to go
on a picnic with you.

711
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,159
Shall we?

712
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,359
No. (STAMMERING)
Let me...

713
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,885
I smell like hospital,
so I should just change.

714
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,447
(SIGHS)

715
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,159
So, uh...

716
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,799
you're a survivor yourself, huh?

717
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,879
Yeah.

718
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,079
I didn't cut this fellow
off for the hell of it.

719
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,681
(GUS CHUCKLES)

720
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,239
GUS: Although it does make an
excellent weight-loss strategy.

721
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,365
- Legs are very heavy.
- (EXHALES DEEPLY)

722
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,999
MICHAEL: (STAMMERING)
How's your health now?

723
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,399
It's great. NEC for 14 months.

724
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,519
- Really?
- Yeah.

725
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,479
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

726
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,764
I'm very lucky.

727
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,441
Hey, listen, Gus.

728
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,565
You have to understand,
Hazel's still pretty sick.

729
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,919
And she will be
the rest of her life.

730
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,439
And she's gonna want to
keep up with you.

731
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,519
She's that kind of girl. But
the truth is, her lungs...

732
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,201
Ready, Gus?

733
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,161
Yeah.

734
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,719
All right. See you soon.

735
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,560
All right.

736
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,399
Oh!

737
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,359
Such a beautiful day.

738
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,439
Yeah.

739
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,959
Is this where you take all
of your romantic conquests?

740
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,879
Every last one of them.

741
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,721
That's probably why
I'm still a virgin.

742
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,039
(CHUCKLES)

743
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,802
You are not still a virgin.

744
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,239
Are you really?

745
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,639
Let me show you something.

746
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,241
(CHUCKLES)

747
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,251
See this circle?

748
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,639
That is a circle of virgins.

749
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,241
Uh-huh.

750
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,411
And this...

751
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,722
is 18-year-old dudes with one leg.

752
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,124
- Oh...
- So, yeah.

753
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,450
<i>Funky Bones</i> by Joep Van Lieshout.

754
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,119
He sounds quite Dutch.

755
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,359
And he is.

756
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,279
Much like Rik Smits.

757
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,609
And tulips.

758
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,399
Sandwich?

759
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,479
Let me guess.

760
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,208
Dutch cheese and tomato.

761
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,684
- Sorry, the tomatoes are Mexican.
- (LAUGHS)

762
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,890
How dare you!

763
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,159
Hmm.

764
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,319
How cool is this?

765
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,839
They're using a skeleton
as a playground.

766
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,010
Think about that.

767
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,919
You do love your symbols.

768
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,919
Speaking of which,
you're probably wondering...

769
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,119
why you're sitting here eating
a bad cheese sandwich...

770
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,559
and drinking orange juice with
a guy in a Rik Smits jersey.

771
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,959
It actually has crossed my mind.
(CHUCKLES)

772
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,439
Well, Hazel Grace,
like so many before you...

773
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,089
and listen, I say this with
the utmost of affection...

774
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,079
you used your wish moronically.

775
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,959
Okay, we've been
through this. I was 13.

776
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,079
Hush! I am in the midst
of a grand soliloquy, here.

777
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,159
You were young, impressionable...

778
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,279
the Grim Reaper staring
you right in the face...

779
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,319
and it led you to rush into making
a wish you didn't really want.

780
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,039
But, how could little Hazel Grace,

781
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,599
having never read
<i>An Imperial Affliction...</i>

782
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,239
know that her one true wish was
to visit Mr. Peter Van Houten...

783
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,399
in his Amsterdam exile.

784
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,321
But I didn't save it, so...

785
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,961
It's a good thing I saved mine.

786
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,919
So, you're saying...

787
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,359
I'm not gonna give you my
wish or anything, Hazel.

788
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,039
If that's what you're thinking.

789
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,641
However...

790
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,008
I, too, have an interest in meeting
this Mr. Peter Van Houten...

791
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,079
and I don't really think
it would make much sense...

792
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,239
to meet him without the
girl who introduced me

793
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,439
to the book in the first place...

794
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,919
now, would it?

795
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,879
So I talked to the Genies,
and they're all for it.

796
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,050
We leave in a month.

797
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,279
No.

798
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,086
Mmm-hmm.

799
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,967
(WHISPERING) Oh, my God.

800
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,119
Oh, my God!

801
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,165
Augustus!

802
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,569
Thank you!

803
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,239
Apparently, they... I don't know
if they do this that often,

804
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,159
but they're willing to
bring me, too, and...

805
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,959
That's incredible.

806
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,719
Hazel, that's so beautiful.

807
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,839
I know.

808
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,679

- It's Amsterdam!

- I know!
- ...and he's giving you his wish.

813

we're talking about Amsterdam.

- I like him so much. I...
- Stop.

821
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,079
Pay attention. Please! Can I go?

822
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,889
Right, as your mom,
I love this idea.

823
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,566
And I... I think we
should talk to Dr. Maria.

824
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,559

But you said that
the PET scan was encouraging.

827
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,839
Well, the PET scan is encouraging,

828
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,159
but we don't know how long
it will stay that way.

829
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,759
Okay, I'm not seeking political asylum.
It's a few days. It's a vacation!

In a foreign country?

832
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,999
They have doctors in
Amsterdam. And cancer.

833
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,999
Well, not all cancers are alike, and
yours is particularly unusual, Hazel.

834
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,519
The only way I could ever
authorize a trip like this

835
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,759
would be if someone
familiar with your case...

836
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,879
What if my mom came?

Of course I will.

What we're trying to do is
prevent endothelial growth...

880
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,199
which, when overexpressed, can
contribute to disease, decay...

vascular inhibition...

882

we're working so hard to eradicate.

The survival rate of patients
with severe endothelial growth...

1133
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,724
will you wear?

1134
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,319
Is that for me?

1135

00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,519
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful.

1137
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,724
I'm just saying.

1138
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,999
You're just saying?

1139
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,079
What, you're saying
that you're totally fine...

1140
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,559
with your teenage daughter running
free with an older boy...

1141
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,159
in a city that's famous
for its vice

1142
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,364
and debauchery is
totally fine with you?

1143
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,239
Yeah, that's pretty much
exactly what I'm saying.

- Thank you, ma'am.
- Wow.

1149

1150
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,968

is unbelievable.

Wow.

1154
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,605

Oh, yeah.

00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,647
Your table, Mr. and Mrs. Waters.

1162
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,760
Thank you.

1163
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,119
Thanks, Gus.

1164
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,131
You are very welcome.

Do you know what Dom Pérignon said

1174
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,203
after he invented champagne?

1175
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,879
"Come quickly," he said.
"I'm tasting the stars."

Welcome to Oranjee.

1178
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,567
Would you like a menu, or will
you have the chef's choice?

1179
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,439
Chef's choice sounds wonderful.

1180
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,759
- Mmm.
- GUS: And, sir, um...

1181
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,719
something tells me we're gonna
need a little bit more of this.

1182
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,879
We have bottled all the
stars for you this evening,

BOTH: Mmm.

1192
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,679
I want this dragon carrot
risotto to become a person...

1193
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,919
so that I can take it
to Vegas and marry it.

(LAUGHS)

1195
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,959
I like your suit.

1196
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,359
Thank you. It's the first
time I've ever worn it.

1197
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,959
That's not the suit
you wear to funerals?

1198
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,119
No.

1199
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,370
That one is not nearly this nice.

1200
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,679
When I first got sick...

1201
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,011
they told me I had an 85 percent
chance of being cancer-free.

1202
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,839
Great odds.

1203
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,799
But that meant a year of
torture, the loss of my leg...

1204
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,721
and, still, a 15 percent
chance it might fail.

1205
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,439
Just before the surgery...

1206
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,090
I asked my parents if I could
buy a really nice suit.

1207
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,679
So, it's your death suit.

1208
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,959
That's what it is.

1209
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,879
I have one of those. I got it
for my fifteenth birthday.

1210
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,720
A dress.

1211
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,921
I don't necessarily think I'd
wear it on a date, though.

Oh. That's just because
she can't speak English.

Well, maybe. I don't know.

1228
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,239
I guess I wouldn't go
as far as to say "no"...

1229
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,411
but I would like some evidence.

1230

What about you?

1231
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,959
- Absolutely.
- Really?

1232

you ride on a unicorn all day...

believe in something.

I mean, otherwise...

1236
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,884
what's the point?

1237
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,399
Maybe there is no point.

1238
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,525
I won't accept that.

I am in love with you.

1243
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,559
And I know that love is just
a shout into the void...

1244
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,359
and that oblivion is inevitable.

1245
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,999
And that we're all doomed...

1246
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,331
and that one day...

1247
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,890
all of our labors
will be returned to dust.

1248

the sun will swallow

All right, so at the end
of the book, Anna's...

1353
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,606
Let's imagine
you're racing a tortoise.

1354
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,719
The tortoise has
a ten-yard head start.

1355
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,679
In the time it takes you
to run ten yards...

1356
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,119
the tortoise has moved maybe
one yard, and so on, forever.

1357
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,439
You're faster than the tortoise,

1358
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,799
but you can never
catch him, you see?

1359
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,439
You can only decrease his lead.

1360
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,119
Now, certainly, you can
run past the tortoise...

1361
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,879
as long as you don't contemplate
the mechanics involved.

1362
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,159
But the question of "how?"

1363
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,119
turns out to be so complicated...

1364
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,159
that no one really solved it...

1365
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:30,719
until Cantor's proof
that some infinities

1366

are bigger than other infinities.

your question.

becomes too sick to continue...

I always thought I'd have
a grand story to tell.

You know, something they would
publish in all the papers, and...

1785
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:23,291
I mean, I was supposed
to be special.

You are special, Augustus.

1787

Yeah, I know. But...

1788
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,399
you know what I mean.

1789
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,685
I do know what you mean,
I just don't agree with you.

1790
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,641
You know this obsession you
have with being remembered?

1791
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:43,601
- Don't get mad.
- I am mad.

1792
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:47,446
I'm mad because I think you're
special. And is that not enough?

1793
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,599
You think that the only way
to lead a meaningful life...

1794
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:56,039
is for everyone to remember
you, for everyone to love you.

1795
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:59,239
Guess what, Gus.
This is your life, okay?

01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,359
This is all you get.

1797
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,479
You get me,
and you get your family,

1798

and you get this world,
and that's it.

1927
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,129
To the right, a little bit.

1928
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:51,928
Yeah, and turn around.
Sit down. There you go.

1929
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,522
It's down to you, Hazel Grace.

1931
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,719
Hello.

1932
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:29,006
My name is Hazel Grace Lancaster...

1933
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,479
and Augustus Waters was the
star-crossed love of my life.

1934
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,439
Ours was an epic love story...

1935
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:40,359
and I probably won't be able to
get more than a sentence out...

1936
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:44,043
without disappearing
into a puddle of tears.

1937
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,439
Like all real love stories...

1938
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,359
ours will die with us.

1939
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:51,291
As it should.

1940
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:58,247
You know, I'd kind of hoped that
he would be the one eulogizing me.

1941
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,448
Because there's really
no one else...

1942
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,599
(CHUCKLES)

1943
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:07,009
Yeah, no. Um...

1944
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,399
I'm not gonna talk about our
love story, because I can't.

1945
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:16,369
So, instead,
I'm gonna talk about math.

1946
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:22,559
I am not a mathematician,
but I do know this.

1947
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,879
There are infinite numbers
between zero and one.

1948
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:31,319
There's point-one, point-one-two,
and point-one-one-two, and...

1949
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:34,287
and an infinite
collection of others.

1950
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:37,239
Of course,
there is a bigger infinite

1951
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,959
set of numbers
between zero and two...

1952
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:44,451
or between zero and a million.

1953
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:49,965
Some infinities are simply
bigger than other infinities.

1954
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,645
A writer that we used
to like taught us that.

1955
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,439
You know, I want more numbers...

1956
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,769
than I'm likely to get.

1957
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,051
And, God...

1958
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,159
do I want more days
for Augustus Waters

1959
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,046
than what he got.

1960
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,771
But, Gus...

1961
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,845
my love...

1962
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,480
I cannot tell you
how thankful I am...

1963
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:25,928
for our little infinity.

1964
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,971
Hold on.

(SNIFFLING)

1966
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,961
You gave me a forever...

within the numbered days.

1968
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,563
And for that, I am...

1969
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,848
I am eternally grateful.

1970
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,927
I love you so much.

1971
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:12,368
I love you, too.

02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:14,879
Fine.

Can I come in?

02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:38,009
I'm so, so sorry.

2088
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,691
Yeah.

2089
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:51,399
It was a privilege,
though, wasn't it?

2090
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,365
To love him?

2091
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,490
Gives you an idea
how we feel about you.

2093
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,807
There's a friend here to see you.

(SIGHS)
Do you know if it hurt or whatever?

2095
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:29,039
Apparently he was struggling
for breath for a long time...

2096
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:32,325
and then eventually
he just went unconscious.

Dying sucks.

Gus really loved you, you know?

2100
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:44,000
I know.

2101
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:47,999
- He wouldn't shut up about it.

Yeah.

2103
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:52,239
It was annoying. He
talked about you so much.

2104
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:53,759
I didn't find it that annoying.

2105
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,681
I know. I know you didn't.

Did you get that letter
from your author friend?

2108
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,130
Ew. He's not my friend.

2109
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:11,359
How do you know about that?

2110
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,919
Well, I was talking
to him at the cemetery...

2111
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:17,279
and he said he came all this way
to give that letter to you.

2112
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,519
Yeah, well, I'm over it.

2113
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,599
I have no interest in reading another
word of that asshole's again.

2114
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:24,759
No, he didn't write it.
Gus wrote it.

2115
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:26,199
What?

2116
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,839
Apparently Gus wrote something down

2117
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,965
and then sent it to Van Houten.

2118

<i>You're a shitty person,
but a good writer.</i>

2121
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:53,239
<i>I think we'd make a good team.</i>

<i>I don't want to ask you
for any favors...</i>

2123
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:58,479

what I saw, you have plenty...</i>

02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:00,239
<i>please fix this for me.</i>

2125

<i>It's a eulogy for Hazel.</i>

2126
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:07,879
<i>She asked me to write one,
and I'm trying.</i>

2127
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:11,759
<i>I just... I could
use a little flair.</i>

2128
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:15,330
<i>See, the thing is, we all
want to be remembered.</i>

2129
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:19,445
<i>But Hazel's different.</i>

2130
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,639
<i>Hazel knows the truth.</i>

2131
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:25,399
<i>She didn't want a million admirers.
She just wanted one.</i>

2132
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:27,206
<i>And she got it.</i>

2133
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:31,239
<i>Maybe she wasn't loved widely,
but she was loved deeply.</i>

2134
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:34,081
<i>And isn't that more
than most of us get?</i>

2135
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:39,119
<i>When Hazel was sick,
I knew I was dying...</i>

2136
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:41,882
<i>but I didn't want to say so.</i>

2137
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:48,639
<i>She was in the ICU, and I
snuck in for 10 minutes...</i>

2138
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:52,050
<i>and I sat with her,
before I got caught.</i>

2139
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,959
<i>Her eyes were closed.
Her skin, pale.</i>

2140
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:58,719
<i>But her hands
were still her hands.</i>

2141
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:02,279
<i>Still warm, and her nails were painted
this dark blue-black color...</i>

2142
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:05,319
<i>and I just held them.</i>

2143
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:08,730
<i>And I willed myself to imagine
a world without us...</i>

2144
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,921
<i>and what a worthless world
that would be.</i>

2145
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:17,199
<i>She's so beautiful.</i>

2146
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:19,039
<i>You don't get tired
of looking at her.</i>

2147
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,719
<i>You never worry if she's
smarter than you...</i>

2148
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:23,084
<i>because you know she is.</i>

2149
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:27,240
<i>She's funny without
ever being mean.</i>

2150
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,651
<i>I love her.</i>

2151
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,999
<i>God, I love her.</i>

2152
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,126
<i>I'm so lucky to love her,
Van Houten.</i>

2153

you get hurt in this world...</i>

2154
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,763
<i>but you do have a say
in who hurts you.</i>

2155
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:51,442
<i>And I like my choices.</i>

2156
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:54,648
<i>I hope she likes hers.</i>

2157
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:57,524
<i>Okay, Hazel Grace?</i>

2158
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:01,331
Okay.
