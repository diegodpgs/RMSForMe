12
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,452
Er, you folks are
American citizens?

13
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,786
I am, yes.

14
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,289
- Where were you born, miss?
- Mrs.

15
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,208
- What?
- Philadelphia.

16
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,126
The name is Vargas.

17
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,712
Hey, Jim! You see who's here?

18
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,965
Sure. Mr Vargas.
Hot on the trail of another dope ring?

19
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,760
Hot on the trail of a chocolate soda
for my wife.

20
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,929
- Your wife?
- Barely a bride, officer.

21
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,806
Hey, can I get through?

22
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,267
A lot of talk up here about
how you cracked that Grandi business.

23
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,353
I hear you caught the big boss.

24
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,939
No, only one of them.
The Grandis are a big family.

25
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,065
Good night.

26
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,608
No purchases, Mr Linnekar?

27
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,068
Hey. Hey, I got this...

28
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,862
- You're an American citizen, miss?
- No, I got this ticking noise.

29
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,656
- Yeah, OK.
- No, really.

30
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,408
- This ticking noise in my head.
- Good night.

31
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,873
Mike? Do you realise
this is the very first time

32
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,875
we've been together
in my country?

33
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,462
Do you realise I haven't kissed you
in over an hour?

34
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,767
Mike, what happened?

35
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,061
That car that just passed us
exploded.

36
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,021
The car?
How could it do that?

37
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,357
I don't know.
I'll have to try to find out.

38
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,026
You'd better not come any closer.
The...

39
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,904
We'll have to postpone that soda,
I'm afraid.

40
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,996
- But Mike, couldn't I...
- Susie, please be careful.

41
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,586
- This could be very bad for us.
- For us?

42
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,171
For Mexico, I mean.

43
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,549
Anyway, there's nothing
I can do over here.

44
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,510
- So?
- So, I'll try not to be too long.

45
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,304
Go on, darling.

46
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,097
You wait at the hotel.

47
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,814
Blaine, I thought you were
back in Washington.

48
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,940
I leave tomorrow.

49
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,650
You know Schwartz
of the local D.A.'s office.

50
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,360
- How do you do, sir?
- Hi.

51
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,154
Can you tell me
who's in charge here?

52
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,947
I can't even tell you
what happened.

53
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,241
Why aren't you back in Mexico City?
Isn't that dope trial coming up?

54
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,826
Grandi? This Thursday.

55
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,454
I'd hoped to go back
on the morning plane, but now...

56
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,456
- You mean this business?
- I'm afraid so.

57
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,334
That bomb came
from the Mexican side of the border.

58
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,211
- The car did.
- Wow.

59
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,235
Lady, he says you don't understand
what he wants.

60
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,071
I understand very well
what he wants.

61
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,614
He saved your life, lady.

62
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,158
Tell him I'm a married woman.

63
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,787
And that my husband is a great,
big official in the government,

64
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,540
ready and willing to knock out
all those pretty front teeth of his.

65
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,250
That's it, lady, your husband.

66
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,169
That's what he wants
to talk to you about.

67
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,093
"Follow this boy at once."

68
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,096
"We have something
very important for Mr Vargas."

69
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,058
Well, what have I got to lose?

70
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,851
Don't answer that.

71
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,645
Lead on, Pancho.

72
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,731
Across the border again?

73
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,656
Hey, Doc. Here comes the D.A.

74
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,078
Where's Captain Quinlan?

75
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,038
Got him out of bed at his ranch.
He's on his way.

76
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,665
Old Hank must be the only one
in the county

77
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,542
who didn't hear the explosion.

78
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,506
Terrible thing, isn't it?
Has the daughter been told?

79
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,258
They're bringing her over right now.

80
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,343
- That's right.
- To identify her father's body.

81
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,851
An hour ago, Rudy Linnekar
had this town in his pocket.

82
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,186
Hmm, now you can strain him
through a sieve.

83
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,280
I guess that's my father.

84
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,241
Now, Miss Linnekar,
can you identify the woman?

85
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,454
I'm not acquainted
with my father's girlfriends.

86
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,247
OK, Miss Linnekar.

87
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,419
Well, here comes Hank at last.

88
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,131
Vargas, you've heard of Hank Quinlan,
our local police celebrity.

89
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,217
- I'd like to meet him.
- That's what you think.

90
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,479
Did they toss it in or was it
planted ahead of time?

91
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,025
- Who?
- Whoever did it, you jackass.

92
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,704
Hey, lady, look at the pretty baby.

93
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:37,390
My nephew says
you call him Pancho. Why?

94
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,395
- Why you call him Pancho?
- Just for laughs, I guess.

95
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,106
This note says
you have something for my husband.

96
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,318
Yeah, Señor Vargas, eh?

97
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,071
You know who I am?

98
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,950
- You want me to guess?
- My name is Grandi.

99
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,327
Oh.

100
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,454
You have heard
that name before, hmm?

101
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,581
Well, aside from the case
my husband's been working on,

102
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,875
isn't Grandi
what that nightclub is called?

103
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,794
Yeah?

104
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,212
Yes.

105
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,716
Grandi's Rancho Grande.
Like a... kind of a joke.

106
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,053
Get it?

107
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,181
I can't say it's the funniest thing
I ever heard.

108
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:22,018
The name ain't Mexican.
I got a permit for this thing.

109
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,730
The Grandi family is living
here in Los Robles a long time.

110
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,774
Some of us in Mexico,
some of us on this side.

111
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,235
- Must be convenient for business.
- Yeah.

112
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,156
- What business?
- Grandi business.

113
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,283
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

114
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,909
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

115
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,578
You know what's wrong with you,
Mr Grandi?

116
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,747
You've been seeing
too many gangster movies.

117
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,499
Mike may be spoiling
some of your fun...

118
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,335
- Mike?
- My husband. Yeah!

119
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,963
And if you're trying
to scare me into calling him off,

120
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,049
let me tell you something,
Mr Grandi.

121
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,218
I may be scared, but he won't be.

122
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,178
You figure it was a bomb then, Hank?

123
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,724
Well, Chief, Rudy Linnekar
could have been struck by lightning.

124
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,850
Where's the daughter?

125
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,644
Marcia? Got her right here
waiting for you, Hank.

126
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,229
Let her go.

127
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,857
You don't even want
to question the daughter?

128
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,151
Let her go and put a tail on her.

129
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,529
Let's see if there was some jane
that Rudy Linnekar had...

130
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,114
Oh, just some, uh, stripteaser.

131
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,659
Well, what do you know?
The D.A. In a monkey suit.

132
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,037
- Well, it's...
- You, too. You got one of them suits.

133
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,205
- Well, we were all at the banquet.
- A political rally?

134
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,626
- No, Tootsie's Steak House.
- G-Men, T-Men.

135
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,963
Quite a little tea party.
All for Rudy Linnekar's bonfire.

136
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,675
Yeah, I hear you even invited
some kind of a Mexic...

137
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,721
Oh, I don't think Mr Vargas
claims any jurisdiction.

138
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,014
Well, I should hope not.

139
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,808
Two people, Americans,
are blown to hash with dynamite,

140
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,269
practically in my own police station.

141
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,481
I wonder what makes you
so very sure it was dynamite?

142
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
My leg.

143
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,692
- Your what?
- His game leg.

144
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:57,030
Sometimes he gets a kind of a twinge,
like folks do for a change of weather.

145
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,074
- Intuition, he calls it.
- Mmm.

146
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,576
Vargas has a theory
that the murder was committed

147
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,286
outside of our jurisdiction.

148
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,831
Of course, we're all of us
going to cooperate with Mr Vargas here.

149
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,959
Don't worry, Captain. I'm merely what
the United Nations would call an observer.

150
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,712
Well, you don't talk like one.
I'll say that for you.

151
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,464
A Mexican, I mean.

152
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,842
Captain, you won't have
any trouble with me.

153
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,679
You bet your sweet life I won't.

154
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,308
As a matter of fact, Mike must be
looking for me just about now,

155
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,769
and that's bound to mean trouble.

156
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,145
What's so funny about that?

157
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,402
He wants to know
if your husband is jealous, Señora.

158
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,445
You silly little pig.

159
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,242
- Who are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you.

160
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,746
You ridiculous old-fashioned,
jug-eared, lopsided little Caesar.

161
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,333
I didn't get that, Señora.
You'll have to talk slow.

162
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,503
I'm talking slow.
But in a minute I'll start to yell.

163
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,798
I wouldn't do that, Señora.

164
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:05,390
See, just a little while ago,
this was a quiet, peaceful town here.

165
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,352
- And now this Vargas comes along...
- Mr Grandi! Mr Grandi.

166
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,730
You said you had something
for my husband.

167
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,523
Don't you think it's time
you gave it to me?

168
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,360
I think it's time for him
to lay off my brother in Mexico City!

169
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,945
That's advice.

170
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,657
That's what I got for him.

171
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,289
Then the conference is over?

172
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,375
I'm free to leave?

173
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,085
Free?

174
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,964
Nobody was holding you
or keeping you, Mrs Vargas.

175
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,091
Nobody laid a hand on you.

176
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,679
You were just paying us a little visit.

177
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,348
Well...

178
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,397
Goodbye, all.

179
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,121
Quinlan, we just can't cross over
into Mexico like this.

180
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,499
- Thousands do every day.
- Tourists, but...

181
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,876
So, we're tourists.

182
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,003
Captain Quinlan
wants to check on the girl

183
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,005
that was with Linnekar
in the death car.

184
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,090
I know. She was
one of the stripteasers.

185
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,844
- I think I told you.
- No, Pete told me before I left the ranch.

186
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,012
That's right.

187
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,891
And I told him that I wanted to see
all the stripteasers in the joint.

188
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,894
This is Mexican territory.
What can we do?

189
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,023
There's no law against visitors asking
questions, is there, Mr Vargas?

190
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,359
Hey, where'd he go?

191
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,780
- Susie, where in the world were you?
- Oh, Mike, darling!

192
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,449
- What happened?
- Just wait till I tell you.

193
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,201
The craziest thing...

194
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,287
- Who's the jane?
- His wife.

195
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,250
Well, what do you know?
She don't look Mexican either.

196
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,738
The key to this whole thing's
the dynamite.

197
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,740
The killer didn't just want
Linnekar dead.

198
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,326
He wanted him destroyed.
Annihilated.

199
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,288
Over here, Vargas.
We're going in the back way.

200
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,129
Señor Vargas.

201
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,092
Yes?

202
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,739
Anything wrong, Vargas?

203
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,743
- No, I just couldn't catch him.
- Oh.

204
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,249
- I hardly knew her.
- Hmm.

205
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,461
- Adair, come on.
- Yes, yes.

206
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,463
And I'm not finished with you yet. I...

207
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,424
- The show's over. I'm going home.
- Oh, no, no, ma'am.

208
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,176
Mr Adair,
as far as I could find out,

209
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,011
none of these people
even knew the murdered girl.

210
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,221
I have no time for that.
Let's talk to this young lady.

211
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,348
- Zita?
- Yeah.

212
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,807
I didn't know her.

213
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,185
She only joined this show
a few days ago.

214
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,771
Aw, we're wasting our time
around here.

215
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,189
Oh, I wouldn't say that!

216
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,815
Well, good night, my dear.

217
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,779
What happened
to Menzies and Vargas?

218
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,322
I don't know. They'll show up.

219
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,907
There may be
some more questions.

220
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,535
Hmm... a pianola.

221
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,205
Hank!
We, we go this way, you know?

222
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,708
Tana's still open for business?

223
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,416
I don't know what Quinlan thinks
she's got to do with it.

224
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,711
Tana? Oh, maybe
she'll cook chilli for him.

225
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,214
Or, er... bring out the crystal ball.

226
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,066
We're closed.

227
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,663
You been cooking at this hour?

228
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,665
- Just cleaning up.
- Huh...

229
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,753
Have you forgotten your old friend?
Huh?

230
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,007
- I told you we were closed.
- I'm Hank Quinlan.

231
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,219
I didn't recognise you.

232
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,264
You should lay off those candy bars.

233
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,685
Hmm. It's either the candy
or the hooch.

234
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,482
I must say, I wish it was your chili
I was getting fat on.

235
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,152
Anyway, you're sure looking good.

236
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,948
- You're a mess, honey.
- Yeah.

237
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,119
Mmm, that pianola
sure brings back memories.

238
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,914
The customers go for it.

239
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,665
It's so old, it's new.

240
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,794
We got the television, too.

241
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,216
We run movies.

242
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,301
What can I offer you?

243
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,221
You haven't heard anything
about that bomb, have you?

244
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,517
That happened
on your side of the border.

245
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,770
In a place like this,
you hear things.

246
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,107
I heard the explosion.

247
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,442
Yeah.

248
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,529
Well, when this case is over,

249
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,783
I must come around some night,
sample some of your chili.

250
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,410
Better be careful.
It may be too hot for you.

251
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,207
- Oh, Hank!
- Yeah?

252
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,876
Looks like our friend Vargas
ran into some trouble.

253
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,462
- Where?
- In the alley behind the nightclub.

254
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,214
Yeah?

255
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,053
- What happened to Vargas?
- What happened?

256
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,555
- What was it, Al?
- Nothing.

257
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,098
- Oh, no?
- Al!

258
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,392
Certainly nothing to do
with this bombing affair.

259
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,102
Somebody threw acid at Vargas.

260
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,730
- It doesn't matter. He missed me.
- Well, who was it, Al?

261
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,191
- I don't know. He got away.
- Oh...

262
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,068
Maybe it's one of the Grandi kids.

263
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,821
What makes you so sure of that,
Captain?

264
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,240
- Intuition.
- Intuition?

265
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:23,911
Well, Vargas and these Keystone Cops
seem to be giving the Grandi family

266
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,539
quite a few headaches lately...
Yeah?

267
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,041
Does your intuition
also tell you about my wife?

268
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,168
Wife?

269
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,378
She was accosted in the street
a little while ago,

270
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,006
and led across to some dive
on your side of the border.

271
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:41,012
The Vargas family seems to be getting
into quite a lot of trouble tonight.

272
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,015
Can you describe this man?

273
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,267
- Well, the first one seems to have been...
- Oh, the first one.

274
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,770
Young, good looking.
- So, there were two men?

275
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,981
- Not exactly.
- Not exactly?

276
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,150
Are you saying she was taken
to this dive by force?

277
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,236
- Not by force, no.
- Oh.

278
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,406
One of the Grandis was there waiting.
"Short, fat, with a moustache."

279
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,658
That's Susan's description,
I haven't run into him.

280
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,784
What?

281
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,662
- They call him Uncle Joe... Grandi.
- That's right.

282
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,332
- Go on.
- Well...

283
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,710
What do you mean, "go on"?
I've told you what happened.

284
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,170
Aren't you going to do something?

285
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,339
If you're making a charge,
I've got to ask the complaint.

286
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,466
Or isn't that police
procedure in Mexico?

287
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,384
- Procedure?
- You say your wife was attacked.

288
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,678
- I did not say she was attacked.
- Would you say she was molested?

289
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,180
Not physically molested, no.

290
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,849
- Was obscene language used?
- I don't think so!

291
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,977
Well, how do you explain the fact
that your wife allowed herself

292
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,271
- to be picked up by this good-look...
- She was not picked up.

293
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,398
Now, Hank, I think we're getting off
on the wrong tack.

294
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,567
Then this good-looking young man
was a 'friend' of hers?

295
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,735
Obviously not.

296
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,154
You wouldn't call that
getting picked up in the street?

297
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,365
Now, now,
we mustn't forget, must we

298
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,951
that Mr Vargas
is not on the witness stand.

299
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,912
Hank's a born lawyer,
you know?

300
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,207
Lawyer. I'm no lawyer.
All a lawyer cares about is the law!

301
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,043
Captain, you are a policeman,
aren't you?

302
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,797
Hmm, aren't you?
You don't seem very fond of the job.

303
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,383
There are plenty of soldiers
who don't like war.

304
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,385
It's a dirty job enforcing the law,

305
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,303
but it's what we're supposed
to be doing, isn't it?

306
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,305
I don't know about you,

307
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,891
but when a murderer's loose,
I'm supposed to catch him.

308
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,314
Well, Pete,
let's get back to civilisation.

309
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,995
Let's go, Hank. It's almost dawn.
You gotta get some rest.

310
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,914
No chance of that, partner.

311
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,917
We got a big day ahead of us.

312
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,424
See any better this way?

313
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,267
You can turn it off now, buster.
You're wasting your batteries.

314
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,739
Susie... what are you doing here
in the dark?

315
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,658
There isn't any shade
on the window.

316
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,913
Well, can we turn the light on now?

317
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,331
No, we can't.

318
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,377
- Why not?
- Because there isn't any bulb any more.

319
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,630
Susie!

320
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,345
Risto!

321
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,721
Risto!

322
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,307
Uncle Joe is plenty mad.
He wants to talk to you.

323
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,685
Risto. Risto, come back here.

324
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,443
Sal, grab him! Stop him!

325
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,778
Grab him, Sal!

326
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,573
Who told you
to throw acid at Vargas?

327
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,575
Stop him!

328
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,249
Who told you
to throw acid at Vargas? Eh?

329
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,461
Who's the boss
of this family?

330
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,255
- Who is the boss?
- My old man.

331
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,466
Yeah, Vic, sure.
But he's in the pen!

332
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,969
Until he gets out,
who's running this outfit?

333
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,346
- Oh, stop it, will ya?
- Who's in charge?

334
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,014
All right, you.

335
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,810
Oh, what a set-up to work with.

336
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,187
One brother in jail,
two others dead!

337
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,899
And nobody left to carry on the business
but a bunch of nephews!

338
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,568
- Listen, Uncle...
- Don't do that!

339
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,029
- You lost your rug, Uncle Joe. The rug.
- Half of you too wet behind the ears.

340
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,991
This isn't the real Mexico.
You know that!

341
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,953
All border towns bring out
the worst in a country.

342
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,832
I can just imagine your mother's face
if she could see our honeymoon hotel.

343
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,250
- Señor Vargas!
- Un momento.

344
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,836
Does this mean you're taking
that early plane back to Mexico City?

345
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,296
Teléfono!

346
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,422
Teléfono...

347
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,133
Because it doesn't leave
for another two hours yet.

348
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,472
All I can say is, if you are taking
that plane, I'm very glad.

349
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,016
I'm very glad you're very glad.

350
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,019
Sí.

351
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,192
Who told you to start this funny stuff
with the acid?

352
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,777
Who told you?

353
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,404
I just wanted to give that wife of his

354
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,239
something to think about
on the honeymoon.

355
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,116
She's going to get plenty.
Don't you worry.

356
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,118
- Here, you lost your rug.
- She's gonna... What?

357
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,204
- You lost your rug.
- Oh.

358
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,624
My old man is in no shape for the pen.
If they give him ten, he dies.

359
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,628
Yeah? And if Vargas gets hurt,
what happens?

360
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,548
My brother Vic
is just as good as convicted.

361
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,759
- You leave Vargas to me!
- Uncle Joe. Uncle Joe.

362
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,135
What?

363
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,106
Sal! This, take it to her.

364
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,452
I don't want
any more postcards.

365
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,876
I don't speak any Spanish.
What is it? What do you want?

366
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,379
I don't know. I was told
to put this in your hands.

367
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,105
- Susie, that was the police.
- Mike, look at...

368
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,732
Quinlan has a lead.
I'm sorry, I have to meet him.

369
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,985
Now, you must tell me
what you want to do.

370
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:16,031
If you are going to Mexico City,
I have time to take you to the airport.

371
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,617
Perhaps that would be best,
just for a few days.

372
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,743
I don't think so.

373
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,497
- But just a minute ago, you...
- A minute ago I said a lot of things.

374
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,917
But now I think the best thing
is to stick close to my husband. OK?

375
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,588
Susie!

376
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,554
- So, Mike, I'm coming with you.
- Coming with me?

377
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,932
But I have to see Quinlan
at the American police station.

378
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,476
- I'll wait at the motel.
- What motel?

379
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,855
Well, there must be one somewhere
on the American side of the border.

380
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,732
The American side of the border.

381
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,693
Oh, well, I'll be safe there
and you won't have to worry about me.

382
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,738
Did I say the wrong thing again?

383
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,576
No, I suppose it would be nice
for a man in my place

384
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,288
to be able to think he could look after
his own wife in his own country.

385
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:08,167
Oh, Mike, if I go to the American motel,
it's just for comfort.

386
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,502
- Sure, sure.
- Not for safety.

387
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,048
Whatever you say, mi vida.

388
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,804
'... Wealthy contractor,
Rudolph Linnekar

389
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,808
'has definitely been identified
with the blonde nightclub dancer

390
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,604
'killed in the explosion a few yards
this side of the Mexican border.'

391
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,068
We're gonna get you
where it really hurts.

392
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,111
And without laying a hand on him.

393
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,202
He's got a reputation.

394
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,872
He's got a young bride.
He's gonna leave this town

395
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,793
wishing he and that wife of his
had never been born.

396
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,221
Don't you see, darling,

397
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,184
if the bomb was planted in Mexico,
and the accused is Mexican,

398
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,437
what a scandal this could turn into?
Internationally?

399
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,816
Might be kind of rough
on the tourist trade.

400
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,111
Susie, one of the longest borders
on earth

401
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,447
is right here
between your country and mine.

402
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,824
It's an open border,

403
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,537
fourteen hundred miles
without a single machine gun in place.

404
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,124
Now, I suppose that all sounds
very corny to you.

405
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,754
I could love being corny
if my husband would only cooperate.

406
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,132
Hey, Susie.

407
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,552
Well...

408
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,370
Vargas?

409
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,538
Hello there, Schwartz.

410
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,623
Quinlan's onto something new.
Coming with us?

411
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,917
I have first to drop my wife
at the motel.

412
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,045
Captain Quinlan wants you to go with him.
I'll drop your wife at the motel.

413
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,756
- Oh, really, I...
- No trouble at all, ma'am.

414
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,257
Aren't you going to drive me?

415
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,426
I'll phone you, darling.
What's the name of that motel?

416
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,386
- The Mirador.
- Quinlan's in kind of a hurry, Vargas.

417
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,597
- Don't bother to phone.
- Try to get some sleep, Susie.

418
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,641
That Mirador's mighty hard to find,

419
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,311
with the new highway branching
off the way it does.

420
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,937
Hey!

421
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,981
- That's all right. I can find the way.
- Oh, gee, I for...

422
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,651
His cane!
I forgot to give him his cane.

423
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,321
He really needs it
for that game leg of his.

424
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,822
They ever tell you
how he got it, huh?

425
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,949
- What, cane?
- No, his bad leg.

426
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,077
- Who're you talking about?
- Captain Quinlan!

427
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,621
Oh!

428
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:54,291
He got it in a gunfight, Mrs Vargas,
that's how.

429
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,461
He was wounded stopping a bullet
that was meant for me.

430
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,174
I reckon the bravest thing
Hank ever did was to give up drink.

431
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,426
He used to be a terrible lush,
you know.

432
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,930
But look at him now.
No sleep, still at it.

433
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,348
Say, he never gives up.

434
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,630
What's wrong?

435
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,299
- What are you following us for?
- Get out of the car.

436
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,386
What? A man can't take a ride
in his own car? What's the big idea?

437
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,762
You'll find out! Come on!

438
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,973
Don't push me.
Keep your hands off me.

439
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,976
Wake up, Mrs Vargas.
We're here. This is it.

440
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,979
This can't be it.

441
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,565
It's all the motel
we got this side of town, ma'am.

442
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,441
The others are all
on the new highway,

443
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,528
and most of them
are closed up till the season starts.

444
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,740
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah! Now listen, Sergeant,

445
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,159
How long are you gonna hold me here?
I haven't done nothing...

446
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,829
Shut up! Mrs Vargas,
can you identify this man?

447
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,290
Of course I can identify him.
That's Grandi.

448
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,916
- I know.
- I'm a member of the family.

449
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,627
Sure, but nobody
has laid a hand on her. Right?

450
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,754
Shut up! Get in the car!

451
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,216
- What about my car?
- You can leave it here.

452
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,551
Where? Here?

453
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,678
In the middle of nowhere?

454
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,805
- You're coming with me!
- On what charge?

455
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,766
I don't know yet.
That's for Captain Quinlan to decide.

456
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,227
Well, what was Grandi doing
way out here?

457
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,856
- He was following us in his car.
- Just driving along.

458
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,066
Oh, well. Where are my bags?

459
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,819
We've already put them
by your cabin, Mrs Vargas. There it is.

460
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,613
The last one. Number seven.

461
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,949
If you should want to change,
just phone the man at the desk.

462
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:55,954
Off-season like this, I reckon
you're about the only one staying here.

463
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:52,803
Er, I turned the music on up for you
up at the office.

464
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,225
Um, I...

465
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,936
Oh...

466
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:05,524
I turned the music on up for you at the...
I thought you'd like it.

467
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,319
Not just now. It's past seven,
and I haven't been to bed yet.

468
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,779
Bed?

469
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,034
Well, you can get into it now.
I brought the sheets.

470
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,954
If they think I'm gonna help make it,
they got another think comin'!

471
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,416
I'm not gonna be
a party to... nothin'.

472
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,626
I'm the night, er...

473
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,795
It... it's day already.

474
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,381
I'm the night man.

475
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,675
Can't the day man
help me make the bed?

476
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,469
There ain't no day man.

477
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,515
He's supposed to be here
at six o'clock this morning,

478
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:42,227
and now they phoned me
and they tell me he ain't coming at all.

479
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,230
They're sending
a new man... new man.

480
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,650
If they think I'm gonna stay here
and wait for him, they got another think...

481
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,777
Well, won't you
help me make the bed?

482
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,864
Bed?

483
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,615
Hey, wait a minute.

484
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,830
That friend of yours,
Mr Grandi, he...

485
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,166
he ain't gonna leave you here
for long.

486
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,710
He is not my friend.

487
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,964
He brought you here
in that car, didn't he?

488
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,134
No, he didn't. As a matter of fact,
he's under arrest.

489
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,722
Under arrest? Mr Grandi?

490
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,766
Yes, he is.

491
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,526
Hold that second charge!

492
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,487
Stop that car!

493
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,615
Hold that car! Stop! Stop!
Hold it!

494
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:48,085
Hey, there was a complaint
about some stolen dynamite out here.

495
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,961
You fired anybody lately?

496
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,963
I figured you'd be asking about that.

497
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,757
Yeah, a boy named Sanchez?

498
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,844
Sure. He's been playing around
with the boss's daughter.

499
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,639
Say, Captain. I just recognised
somebody over there at the blaster.

500
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,932
Oh, with the big ears? Yeah.

501
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,059
Our office prosecuted that guy
for voluntary manslaughter.

502
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,187
Get him over here.
That's Eddie Farnum. Got five to ten.

503
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,982
You have to get out of here.
We're gonna blast again.

504
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,985
- How long you been out?
- Three months.

505
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,404
- Quick parole.
- Who got you this job?

506
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,116
- My lawyer, Howard Frantz.
- Grandi's lawyer.

507
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,784
'Come in, car ten.

508
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,328
'Suspect now in custody
at Five-O-Three Innes Place.'

509
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,831
- Well, this is it.
- Suspect?

510
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,375
That the one you been talking about?
This Sanchez?

511
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,127
They've located him.
Right, Captain?

512
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,462
Yeah, Marcia Linnekar's apartment.
Come on.

513
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,589
Stand still. We're gonna blast.

514
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:41,096
What's wrong, Farnum?
You short of dynamite?

515
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,449
Captain, have you anything definite
on this boy Sanchez?

516
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,744
Not yet.
I'm just going on my intuition.

517
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,205
Hey, I think this car
belongs to Howard Frantz.

518
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,665
- Yeah?
- You remember him.

519
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,459
He was that slick lawyer
that got Farnum a parole.

520
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,588
Yeah, he was
Rudy Linnekar's attorney, too.

521
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,716
- Isn't that Quinlan?
- Quinlan?

522
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,385
Ah, it figured we'd have
Hank Quinlan to deal with.

523
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,678
- You finished packing?
- Yeah.

524
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,054
I heard about that guy.

525
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,183
Say nothing, my dear. Leave
everything to me. Let's get your bag.

526
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,913
Remember, I'll do all the talking.

527
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,123
How do we begin?

528
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,542
Do we play around first
with a few nasty questions?

529
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,336
Or does he get out
the rubber hose right away?

530
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,587
Take it easy.

531
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,342
Vargas!

532
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,135
Yes, Captain.

533
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,931
I got my orders, Vargas.

534
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,934
I'm supposed to extend you
every courtesy.

535
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,479
That don't mean you...
you do the interrogating.

536
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,398
I know, Captain.
That's what I told Sanchez.

537
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,359
Hmm. You're Ed Hansen?

538
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,403
- That's right, Captain Quinlan.
- Run out and get me some coffee, Ed.

539
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,948
How 'bout you. Miss Linnekar?
Marcia, isn't it?

540
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,325
- Want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

541
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,663
I really need it.
I'm an old man, Marcia.

542
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,249
I go a whole night
without sleep, I feel it.

543
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,752
Of course,
it was a lot worse for you.

544
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,257
Terrible thing
what happened to your dad.

545
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,343
Have you been living here
for some time, Marcia? How long?

546
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,886
- Four months.
- Marcia!

547
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,680
Huh. You have a little quarrel
with your dad?

548
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,306
Perhaps I should introduce myself.

549
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,267
- I'm Miss Linnekar's attorney.
- I know who you are.

550
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,477
- I'm Howard Frantz.
- Yes, Mr Frantz.

551
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,063
I'm Manolo Sanchez.
And I haven't got any attorney!

552
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,649
Huh. You two been sharing
this apartment?

553
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,486
I must explain. On my advice,
my client is moving elsewhere.

554
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,405
Well, that means
she has been living with this man.

555
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,033
She will hold herself available
for your later questionings.

556
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,078
- I will be present, of course.
- Of course.

557
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,497
Marcia, where was
your friend Sanchez last night?

558
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,917
Later, Captain, later.
After she's rested.

559
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,252
Come, my dear.

560
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,256
Casey, would you take a look
in the desk there?

561
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,216
Might see some letters
or somethin'.

562
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,635
That is, unless you've already
looked the place over.

563
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,596
We know better than that, Captain.
We were waiting for you.

564
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,229
I don't speak Mexican.

565
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,362
Let's keep it in English, Vargas.

566
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,282
It's all right with me.

567
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,284
I'm sure he's just as unpleasant
in any language.

568
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,828
Unpleasant? Strange!

569
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,539
I've been told I have
a very winning personality.

570
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,250
The very best shoe clerk
the store ever had.

571
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,253
Well, you weren't working as a
shoe clerk out on that construction crew.

572
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,756
- Stick around, Vargas.
- I intend to.

573
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,634
In English!
I don't like to repeat myself.

574
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,387
I merely asked him
if I could use his telephone.

575
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,058
English.

576
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,811
Translation - the telephone
is in the bedroom, Señor.

577
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,481
That's all he said.

578
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:25,403
Also, he told me he thinks
he's in for some sort of third degree.

579
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,947
I assured him
he had nothing to worry about.

580
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,909
Casey, go in with Vargas.

581
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,745
Maybe he don't know
how to use an American telephone.

582
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,539
I think I ran onto something here,
Captain. Some love letters.

583
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,458
Oh, you can read them
in the bedroom.

584
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,169
I don't want to leave
that Vargas guy alone.

585
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,713
- OK.
- Save the good stuff for me.

586
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,132
- Now, in English.
- What do you want to know?

587
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,301
- Everything, the works.
- Let's start with the shoe store.

588
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,136
- Want me to call the motel, Vargas?
- Later.

589
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,056
That's how you met Linnekar's
daughter, in the shoe store?

590
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,267
Yeah, selling her shoes.
And I've been at her feet ever since.

591
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,769
Then the construction job.

592
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,606
You stayed just long enough on that one
to get your hands on some dynamite.

593
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,732
What are you scared of, boy?

594
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:06,111
I'd only slap you again
if you got hysterical again.

595
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,654
It wouldn't be anything brutal.

596
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,032
Why, even back in the old days,
we never tried to hurt people in the face.

597
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,076
It marks 'em up.
We gave it to 'em like this.

598
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,497
The boy's getting a rough deal.

599
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,291
He could even be innocent,
you know?

600
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,835
Intuition?

601
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,505
Why not? Quinlan doesn't have
a monopoly on hunches.

602
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,674
Well, who do you like
for the killer?

603
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,552
Too early to tell.
Um, that ex-convict.

604
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,679
You mean
out on that highway job?

605
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,389
- Farnum.
- Maybe.

606
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,724
Wait a minute.
Some dynamite was stolen.

607
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,853
Yeah, and that construction crew's
working for Linnekar.

608
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,229
Amigo, I think
you're onto something.

609
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,816
Yes, it's quite an apartment...
for a shoe clerk.

610
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,361
- Who pays for it? Marcia?
- What if she does?

611
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,280
Oh, how long
has this been going on, eh?

612
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,740
Ever since her father had me fired
from the last job, if you want to know.

613
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,870
Well, naturally he objected to having
a Mexican shoe clerk for a son-in-law.

614
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,456
So, naturally, you had to put him
out of the way!

615
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,541
Naturally!

616
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,710
Now, just because
he speaks a little guilty,

617
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,712
that don't make him innocent,
you know?

618
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,297
You can show motive, yes.

619
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,132
But don't you need
a bit more than that?

620
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,719
Oh, we'll get it.
Oh, there's my coffee.

621
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,681
Didn't you bring me
any doughnuts or sweet rolls?

622
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,850
You'll have to put him
on the scene of the crime.

623
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,935
- We will.
- You've got to have some evidence.

624
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,146
We'll get it. We'll... Well?

625
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,315
Well, you didn't ask me
to get any doughnuts, Captain.

626
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,900
Where are you going?

627
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,611
This is not my case, Captain.

628
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,779
What finally convinced you of that?

629
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,158
This is not my country, that's all.
I'm not convinced.

630
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,203
Well, ain't that a shame.

631
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,706
- Is there another phone near here?
- Right across the street.

632
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,681
Excuse me, madam.
Could I use your telephone, please?

633
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,975
Right in front of you.

634
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,061
Do you have a phone book?

635
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,522
I'm blind, mister.
You'll have to ask for Information.

636
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,732
Oh, I'm sorry.

637
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,700
Hello, I'd like the telephone number
of the Mirador Motel.

638
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,869
- What is this place you're taking me to?
- Get going!

639
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,497
- Now listen, this is ridiculous.
- Now, go on!

640
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,999
- Who's this?
- Who are you? Don't push.

641
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,460
- Where's Captain Quinlan?
- He's in there making a search.

642
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,671
- What am I doing in here?
- Oh, Hank.

643
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,006
What's the idea,
barging in on me like this?

644
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,424
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- Who you got in here?

645
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,760
- I forgot to give you your cane.
- All right, sit down.

646
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,303
Queer thing, Hank.

647
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,139
When I was taking Mrs Vargas
to the motel,

648
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,516
I picked this guy on the way.

649
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,726
I know him. It's Uncle Joe Grandi.

650
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,186
Why'd you bring him in here?

651
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:48,690
For some crazy reason,
he was following me in his car.

652
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,650
- He was tailing you?
- Yeah.

653
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,282
Why would I be following a cop?
He's an idiot.

654
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,285
Maybe because you thought
he was a Mexican cop.

655
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,496
Because you thought he was Vargas.
He was driving Vargas's car.

656
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,415
- Oh.
- Right?

657
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,710
So, you're right. So I thought
I was following Vargas. So what?

658
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,587
Sit down.

659
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,797
- It's a free country.
- Shut up.

660
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,226
'- Is this the Mirador Motel?
- I'm trying to... '

661
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,687
Yes, it's the Mirador Motel,
and it's me.

662
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,983
Oh, darling. The news is bad.

663
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,111
Quinlan is about to arrest
that boy, Sanchez, and...

664
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,614
Oh, Mike,
is that why you called?

665
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,532
To tell me
somebody's been arrested?

666
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,620
No, that's not really
why I called. It...

667
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:49,167
It's to tell you how sorry I am
about all this.

668
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,628
'How very, very much I love you.

669
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,672
'Susie? '

670
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,592
I'm still here,
my own darling Miguel.

671
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,511
Oh. I thought
maybe you'd fallen asleep.

672
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,642
I was just listening to you breathe.
It's a lovely sound...

673
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,520
But I am sleepy.

674
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,648
Oh.

675
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,775
Of course you are.

676
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,987
Well then, I'll be calling you back later.
Goodbye for now.

677
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,572
Mike?

678
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,414
- Hello.
- 'Yes? '

679
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,542
Oh, I just wanted to tell you
I'm awfully tired.

680
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,921
Oh, excuse me.
This is Mrs Vargas talking.

681
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,591
- 'I know. It couldn't be anybody else.'
- Oh?

682
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,512
'You're the only guest we got here
just now... in the whole place.'

683
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:47,308
Oh. Well, as I started to tell you,
there's no sign to put up outside the door,

684
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:51,729
and I just wanted to make sure
I wouldn't be disturbed.

685
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,148
Oh, that is if you're the one
who's in charge.

686
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:58,778
Don't you worry, Mrs Vargas.
I'm the one who's in charge here.

687
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:02,657
Nobody's going to get through to you
unless I say so.

688
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:06,119
Oh, Vargas. Sergeant Menzies
wanted me to give you this.

689
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,954
- Your car keys.
- Thanks.

690
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,212
Well, I was beginning to think
we'd lost you for good.

691
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,381
I had a phone call to make.

692
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,592
English!

693
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,511
They've got me measured
for the fall guy.

694
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,637
Now, just a minute.

695
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,849
Sure, I'm the fortune hunter
who hypnotised Marcia,

696
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,351
who made her kill her father
for his money.

697
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,437
Boy, if I had that kind of power,

698
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,439
I wouldn't be where I am today.
Believe me.

699
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,357
You mean you don't care
about the money?

700
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,109
Why should I lie?

701
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,361
If it hadn't been for the money,
I wouldn't have given her a tumble.

702
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,573
But I told her that right at the beginning.
But still she wanted...

703
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,616
Why bother?
You wouldn't believe it.

704
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,076
Try me.

705
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,287
I'm a good listener.

706
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:54,375
Well, instead of the man chasing the girl,
suppose she was the one.

707
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,502
Suppose she asked him
to marry her.

708
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,129
What should he do?
Draw himself up and say,

709
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,299
"No, my dear. You and I could never be
happy together because of your money"?

710
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,218
- What would you do, Vargas?
- The question is, what did you do?

711
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,471
Yeah, what did you do, boy?

712
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,348
- Well, you know what I did, Captain.
- Yeah, I know. I was asking you.

713
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,517
- Marcia and I made a bomb.
- That's right. You made a bomb.

714
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:15,313
- And we blew up her father, of course!
- At last you're admitting it.

715
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,233
Don't you see you don't help yourself
by treating this as a joke?

716
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,194
Uh, are you finished?

717
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,821
Anything more
you want to say, Vargas?

718
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:24,947
- No, Captain.
- Oh, good.

719
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,491
- Pete, since you're here...
- Yes, Hank.

720
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,326
I wish you'd search the place.

721
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,329
I'm too tired to go on with it.

722
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,122
Sanchez's desk
has been looked into.

723
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,334
- Take the bedroom, then the bathroom.
- OK, Hank.

724
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,253
I haven't been very thorough.

725
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,379
- Now, listen.
- Yeah.

726
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,173
How long do I have to sit here?

727
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,884
I wasn't breaking no laws.
I was just...

728
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,888
- I don't even know these people.
- You know Vargas, don't you?

729
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:52,099
- Who's this?
- Uncle Joe Grandi. Another Grandi.

730
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,936
Yeah, you nabbed his brother
on a narcotics rap.

731
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,188
- I don't know this Grandi.
- Yeah?

732
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,024
- I got nothing to do with you, Varg...
- Shut up.

733
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,943
I'm an American citizen.

734
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,112
Now listen, Vic was arrested
in Mexico City, Captain.

735
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,615
Vargas is gonna testify
at his trial Thursday.

736
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,909
It's got absolutely
nothing to do with...

737
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,870
You just try any rough stuff,
Uncle Joe, and you'll find out.

738
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,581
He's a big shot
in the Mexican government. Listen...

739
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,585
Anybody lays a hand on Mr Vargas
between now and Thursday,

740
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:23,172
and my brother Vic
is just as good as convicted.

741
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,757
- Hank?
- Yeah?

742
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,342
- What is it, Pete?
- I found it!

743
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:30,054
- Found what, partner?
- Come here and look!

744
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,139
I don't even know this Sanchez.

745
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,184
- All right, boy.
- Boy, you come in here!

746
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,437
Now, in English, just how much dynamite
was it you stole?

747
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,023
What good would it be to tell you
that I've never seen any dynamite?

748
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:44,360
Poor Rudy Linnekar. He did all he could
to keep you away from his daughter.

749
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,947
But she stands to inherit a million bucks,
so naturally you just moved in here.

750
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,576
- Marcia and I were married. Secretly!
- A million bucks. No secret about that.

751
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,619
And you got scared
he'd change his will.

752
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,330
- Why don't you let up for a minute?
- So you got yourself this highway job...

753
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,416
You broke into the explosives bin
and stole it.

754
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,751
- That's a lie!
- You stole ten sticks of dynamite!

755
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,503
No, no!

756
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,215
Well, Hank has done it again.
He's nailed his man.

757
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,508
Thanks to you, partner.

758
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:11,470
Me? Say, if that dynamite had been
a snake there in the bathroom,

759
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,805
it would have bit me.

760
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,433
I told Chief Gould
that I'd keep you informed, Vargas.

761
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,060
So, I'm doing it. This is it.
We've broken the case.

762
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:21,397
Rudy Linnekar was blown up
with eight sticks of dynamite.

763
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,150
And Sanchez stole ten,
that leaves two.

764
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,902
And we found them both.

765
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,779
You heard that, boy.
We found the dynamite.

766
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,783
- That's impossible.
- Well, we found two sticks.

767
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,744
- Black Fox. The identical brand.
- It's the right brand.

768
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,704
- Where did you find this?
- Right here in your love nest.

769
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,581
- Where?
- Where you had it stashed, of course.

770
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,707
What are you trying to do?

771
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,876
We're trying to strap you
to the electric chair, boy.

772
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,962
We don't like it when innocent people
are blown to jelly in our town!

773
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,424
Yes. An old lady on Main Street
last night picked up a shoe.

774
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,593
And the shoe had a foot in it.

775
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,386
We're gonna make you pay
for that mess.

776
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,138
- They're trying to rail road me!
- Yeah...

777
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,974
I don't know why.
I never stole any dynamite.

778
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,436
You'll have to stop him yourself.

779
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,898
From now on, he can talk Hindu
for all the good it'll do him.

780
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,651
He swears on his mother's grave

781
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,862
that there has never been
any dynamite in this apartment.

782
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,489
Sure, sure.

783
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,784
- Take him in. Book him.
- Let's go.

784
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,454
You say you found this dynamite
in the bathroom?

785
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,956
Pete found it.
Show him the dynamite.

786
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,082
Right here.

787
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,459
Can't you do something
to help me?

788
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,713
Oh, what are you
scared of, partner?

789
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,343
That stuff isn't nearly as easy
to blow up as people seem to think.

790
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,886
It doesn't go off quite that easy.

791
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:37,223
- You found the dynamite in this box?
- Dynamite?

792
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,228
Yeah. Pete found it.
We told you that.

793
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,729
- Captain...
- Yeah?

794
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:50,111
I looked in that box... just now.
There wasn't anything there.

795
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,949
I know how you feel.

796
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,201
- Do you?
- Sure, I do.

797
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,371
You people are touchy.

798
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:05,418
It's only human you'd want to come to
the defence of your fellow countryman.

799
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,551
Vargas?

800
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,803
- Vargas, don't worry.
- Why should I worry?

801
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,139
Huh, you go right ahead
and say anything you want to.

802
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,558
Folks'll bear
your natural prejudice in mind.

803
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,185
I saw that shoebox
ten minutes ago, Captain.

804
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,229
Yeah? Well, maybe
you didn't notice.

805
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,148
I knocked it over
on the bathroom floor.

806
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,692
I couldn't very well have failed
to notice two sticks of dynamite.

807
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,944
- Tell any story you want to, Vargas!
- The shoebox was empty!

808
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,696
Go on saying it's empty!
Folks'll understand.

809
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,698
I'm saying more than that,
Captain.

810
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,411
You framed that boy.
Framed him!

811
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,629
What's the matter with him, Hank?
Is he crazy?

812
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,465
Yeah, that must be it. Crazy.

813
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,051
Hank, what are we gonna do
with this Grandi guy? Take him in?

814
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,177
Grandi?

815
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,472
I think you ought to realise that if a man of
Vargas's position is willing to testify...

816
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,391
Who are you working for?
The Mexican government?

817
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,602
I'm working
for the District Attorney.

818
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:08,564
Well, listen! I got a position in this
town, a reputation. Who's Vargas?

819
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,941
Vargas is
kind of important, too, Hank.

820
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,902
Somebody's gonna have to give in
on this thing.

821
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,196
Well, either that
or somebody's gonna be ruined.

822
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,948
- Captain Quinlan.
- What do you want?

823
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,786
Schwartz, you saw
that shoebox in the bathroom.

824
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,537
You know it was empty.

825
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:28,584
Well, now, I didn't happen
to see it myself, but I believe you.

826
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:38,219
We are both after
the same exact thing, Captain.

827
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,931
If Vargas goes on like this, shooting
his face off like he was just now...

828
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,183
Ah, move along.
Stop making trouble, Grandi.

829
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,894
Trouble? Who's the one
who is making trouble?

830
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,979
Vargas. Sure!

831
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,315
For my brother Vic in Mexico City.
For you here.

832
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,067
Ah, go peddle your papers,
Uncle Joe.

833
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,944
Why, you just said it yourself.

834
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,197
Somebody's reputation
has got to be ruined.

835
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,032
Why shouldn't it be Vargas's?

836
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,661
- What are you waiting for?
- Nothing, I...

837
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,288
- Well, we got work to do.
- OK, Hank, OK.

838
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,834
- Well, what do you want?
- Nothing, Captain.

839
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,629
- Nothing that you don't want, too.
- Go on, spit it out, then.

840
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,841
Captain, we cannot
stand out here in the street.

841
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,427
Why don't we go somewhere
nice and private, eh?

842
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,305
Where we can sit down
and have a drink?

843
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,308
I don't drink.

844
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,280
- Look, Schwartz...
- Al.

845
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,740
Al.

846
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,701
We must show where Quinlan himself
got the dynamite.

847
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:29,163
If you're really with me on this,
we have still to get some proof.

848
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,041
- We've got your word.
- Let's do better than that.

849
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,794
In your country also, when explosives
are purchased, some record is kept, no?

850
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,422
Sure. And we're going
to the right place to look it up.

851
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,591
Hey, how about Quinlan's ranch?

852
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,219
- Where is that?
- Just outside town.

853
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,847
While you're looking up the
dynamite records, I might go out there.

854
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,516
Al, there is one thing
that worries me, still.

855
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,643
What's that?

856
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:55,314
I could be wrong about this.
And that would be very bad for you.

857
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,025
Let's see
if you're wrong first, amigo.

858
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:25,177
I wondered if you could
turn that music off.

859
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,058
Would it be possible to ask
those people next door to move?

860
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,018
Just to another cabin?

861
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,187
You see, I'm still trying
to get some sleep.

862
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,690
Where would you like me
to take you, doll?

863
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,739
- You got the stuff?
- Here.

864
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,662
I brought this.
Some of the other guys got more.

865
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,706
And the hypo?

866
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,626
Hi.

867
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,378
What are you doing here?

868
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,297
- Turn it down.
- I...

869
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,427
I-I'm the night man.

870
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,763
Yeah? Well you're a little early,
ain't you?

871
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:13,058
Well, I thought I'd better come back,
see if the new...

872
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:24,194
Which... one of you
is the new day man?

873
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,115
- Beat it.
- I...

874
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,413
It's a mile and a half
down to the highway.

875
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,959
I think I'd better stay.

876
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,920
Go in the kitchen
and get yourself something to eat.

877
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,299
I...

878
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,138
- I brought my lunch.
- Eat it now.

879
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,392
Eat it now? Yes.

880
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,108
I know you.
You're the Grandi boys.

881
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,612
Your Uncle Joe
know you're here?

882
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,155
Who could that be?

883
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,617
Take it easy, Pretty Boy.
What're you in such a sweat about?

884
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,619
It's a tough rap
to get caught with this stuff.

885
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,829
It's only that Vargas dame again,

886
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,043
- Yes, ma'am.
- 'Get me State one-two-one-two.'

887
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,214
Very good, ma'am.
State one-two-one-two.

888
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,512
Hey! Hey!
That's the police department!

889
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,972
- Yeah?
- It's the police, all right.

890
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,725
- What do we do now?
- We do nothing.

891
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,645
We relax
and have ourselves a ball,

892
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,234
I'm very sorry, Mrs Vargas,

893
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,320
but the telephone
is temporarily out of service.

894
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,781
I'll call you just as soon
as it's repaired.

895
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,451
Better call Uncle Joe.

896
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,843
So that is our
little arrangement, see?

897
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:16,390
A real sweet set-up. And all the help
we need from the law...

898
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:20,018
Listen, you knock somebody off...
I don't care who it is.

899
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,895
There won't be any
"little arrangement".

900
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,939
Not with Hank Quinlan.

901
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,108
- Joe, a message for you.
- Yeah.

902
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,277
Vargas can't hurt me.

903
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,903
Well, maybe not.

904
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:34,825
But maybe with our little deal,
we can hurt him.

905
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,743
I don't make deals.

906
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,209
Yeah? Why, sure, I'm all right.

907
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:47,087
No, no, no, look.
Just go ahead like I said.

908
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,548
- Don't worry. No matter what...
- Something wrong out there?

909
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,133
No, no. Nothing we can't fix.

910
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,218
We? Where do you get
that "we" stuff?

911
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,679
I haven't given you
any answer yet.

912
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,848
Listen to you.

913
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,143
You keep talking as though
this was some kind of a deal

914
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,354
where I ask you
to get me out of a rap.

915
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,357
No. That ain't it at all.

916
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,776
In this thing
we're partners, see?

917
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,530
- Shall we drink to that?
- I don't...

918
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,997
Juanito,
two more double bourbons.

919
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,463
Make 'em nice and big.

920
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,363
All I can say is,
this better be important.

921
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,489
It is.

922
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,116
I think we're out of our minds
to be here in Mexico at all.

923
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:01,078
- Well, Vargas, you sent for us.
- Mr Adair.

924
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,706
Gentlemen. Now, it isn't really true
that I sent for you.

925
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:07,334
- Mr Schwartz insisted that I myself...
- Let's get down to cases.

926
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,419
- You know Chief Gould.
- How do you do, sir?

927
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,921
Where's this so-called document?

928
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,257
- Perhaps we'd better go to my room.
- Yes, by all means, yes.

929
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,467
- In here, gentlemen.
- Go ahead.

930
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,344
No, no, no. I'll walk.

931
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,430
- Oh, OK.
- The lift is rather small, I'm afraid.

932
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,848
Chief Gould.

933
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,728
Just press the button
for the second floor.

934
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,438
I'll meet you there.

935
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,484
I still don't know why Vargas
couldn't come to my office.

936
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:36,280
He has practically cabinet status
with the Mexican government, you know.

937
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,073
Well, if he's so important...

938
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,117
He can't make a formal call
on either of you

939
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,660
without going through
his consulate

940
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,037
and putting the whole thing
on an international level.

941
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,748
Cut out all the fancy talk
and what does it boil down to?

942
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,417
This Mexican
is bringing criminal charges

943
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,878
against one of the most respected
police officers in the country.

944
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,839
And that's
what it boils down to!

945
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:57,759
Eh, well, Vargas,
you must be pretty quick on your feet.

946
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,137
It's just that the lift is slow.
This way, gentlemen.

947
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,597
Thank you.

948
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,104
After you.

949
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,483
I have it right over here.

950
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,864
There.
While you're looking at it,

951
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,658
perhaps you'll excuse me
if I finish a call I've put in.

952
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,454
Where'd you get this?

953
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,414
From your Department of Records
about an hour ago.

954
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,584
- They'll let anybody in there.
- Well, it doesn't mean anything.

955
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,919
- That's your wife you're calling, isn't it?
- Yes.

956
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,546
- You know who owns the Mirador?
- No, I...

957
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:38,634
"June 18th.
Hills Hardware in Los Robles."

958
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,888
"17 sticks,
Black Fox brand, to H. Quinlan."

959
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,391
Quinlan needed dynamite for work
on his ranch - simple coincidence.

960
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,560
Mr Adair... Hello?

961
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,649
Yes?

962
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,984
Mirador? My name is Vargas.

963
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,445
I'd like to speak
with my wife, please.

964
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:02,115
'I'm very sorry, Mr Vargas,
but your wife left definite instructions.'

965
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,950
She's not to be disturbed.

966
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,666
'Honey.

967
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,001
'You, in the next room.'

968
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,587
What is it?

969
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,757
'Come to the wall,
so I can whisper.'

970
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:24,930
Yes?

971
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:29,851
'You know what the boys
are trying to do, don't you?

972
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,526
'They are trying to get in there.
They went to get the master key.

973
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,697
'You know what marijuana is,
don't you? '

974
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,618
Yes, eh...

975
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,746
'You know what a Mary Jane is?

976
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,793
'You know what a mainliner is? '

977
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,006
I think so.

978
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,092
But what's that
got to do with me?

979
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,596
'You take it in the vein.'

980
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,934
You're trying to tell me
these boys are drugged?

981
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,811
- Is that why...
- 'Shh.'

982
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,815
Hey, you think they're ready
for that stuff yet?

983
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,777
Not yet, kid.

984
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,159
The fun is only beginning.

985
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,204
Hank, I've been looking for you
in every bar in town.

986
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,290
Yeah, I've been in half of 'em.

987
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,709
But only here on the wrong side
of the border.

988
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,795
I never drink
on my own beat, partner.

989
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,547
Bartender, give him
some black coffee, quick.

990
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,758
- I don't need black coffee.
- He's called a meeting, Hank.

991
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,926
- A meeting?
- Vargas, at his hotel.

992
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:48,263
- The motel?
- No, right here across the street.

993
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:51,892
- Well, I don't need any coffee. Not yet.
- Not yet?

994
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,478
This is a swell time
to be getting fried, I must say.

995
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,645
My job's over, Pete.

996
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,689
- You ought to be working on Sanchez.
- Listen, Hank...

997
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:58,899
We gotta break him.

998
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,568
Vargas is telling the Chief and the D.A.
That you planted that dynamite.

999
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,153
Ah, he was a fool.

1000
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,155
They're taking him seriously.
They came to him.

1001
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,033
No, I mean Sanchez.
Dynamite's no way to kill.

1002
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,494
Did I ever tell you
the smart way to kill, Pete?

1003
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,246
- Sure, sure, strangling.
- Mmm.

1004
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,956
Clean, silent.

1005
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:17,876
- You told me all that. Finish that coffee.
- That's how my wife died.

1006
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:21,087
- I don't usually talk about my wife.
- Never when you're sober.

1007
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,842
- She was strangled, Pete.
- I know, I know.

1008
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,094
Binding cord. She was working
up at the packing plant,

1009
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,430
so the killer had it right to hand.
Smart.

1010
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:34,434
You don't leave fingerprints
on a piece of string.

1011
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,269
Bartender, what do I owe you?

1012
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,772
That half-breed done it, of course.
We all knew that.

1013
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,732
But I was just a rookie cop.

1014
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,234
Four seventy-five.

1015
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,987
I followed around after him,
eating my heart out...

1016
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,949
trying to catch him.

1017
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,743
But I never did.

1018
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,912
Then in some mudhole
in Belgium,

1019
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:56,832
the Good Lord
done the job for me, 1917.

1020
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:00,544
Pete, that was the last killer
that ever got out of my hands.

1021
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,170
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

1022
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:06,091
To Señor Vargas's meeting.
He wants to fight dirty? OK.

1023
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,718
That's the kind of fight
he's gonna get.

1024
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,887
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps what?

1025
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:13,390
Perhaps he honestly thinks
that Sanchez is guilty.

1026
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,559
- 'Course he does!
- There's no perhaps about it.

1027
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:19,396
- Hank Quinlan is an honest cop.
- There are all kinds of policemen, sir.

1028
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,482
I don't have to tell you that.
A few take bribes.

1029
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:24,067
Hank Quinlan
never took a dollar in his life.

1030
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,735
Most are honest, yes!

1031
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:30,282
But even some of the honest men
abuse their power in other ways.

1032
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:32,868
Come in, Hank.

1033
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,413
Well, I...

1034
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,958
don't know
whether I'm welcome or not.

1035
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,585
I want you to hear this.

1036
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,630
I've heard it already.

1037
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:50,093
Our friend Vargas has some very
special ideas about police procedure.

1038
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,470
He seems to think it don't matter
whether a killer's hanged or not,

1039
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,973
so long as we obey the fine print
in the rule books.

1040
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,267
Captain, I don't think a policeman
should work like a dog-catcher.

1041
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:00,145
- No?
- Putting criminals behind bars. No!

1042
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,732
In any free country, a policeman
is supposed to enforce the law.

1043
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,859
And the law protects the guilty,
as well as the innocent.

1044
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:10,155
- Our job is tough enough. We got...
- It's supposed to be. It has to be tough.

1045
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,782
A policeman's job is only easy
in a police state.

1046
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,951
That's the whole point, Captain.

1047
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:18,288
Who is the boss?
The cop or the law?

1048
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,832
- Where's your wife, Vargas?
- What are you?

1049
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,126
What do you mean? You know
where she is as well as I do.

1050
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:26,421
Sergeant Menzies drove her.
She's at the motel.

1051
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:29,883
Oh? And you're still here?

1052
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,010
Yes. I'm checking out now
and joining her.

1053
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,262
Do you have a reason
for asking, Captain?

1054
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:37,140
No, I had no special reason. No.

1055
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,142
No, I just wondered.

1056
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,187
Well, what do you know?

1057
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,231
A mother pigeon and her nest.
Pigeon egg.

1058
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,275
- Eh?
- Captain.

1059
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,402
You did buy 17 sticks
of dynamite, didn't you?

1060
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,948
You tell your story, Vargas.
I don't have to answer your questions.

1061
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,574
A hired hand
at your ranch says...

1062
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,077
- My ranch?
...he used about 15 sticks.

1063
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:03,625
You been spying out at my ranch?
A foreigner?

1064
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,669
Without my knowledge, Hank!
Without my permission!

1065
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,796
At your ranch, you used 15 sticks
of dynamite, Quinlan.

1066
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,007
That leaves two sticks missing, and
two sticks were found in that shoebox.

1067
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,426
He's just asking, Hank. Hank!

1068
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,096
What's that for?

1069
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:20,350
- It's for... it's for letting him ask.
- Oh, Hank, wait a minute!

1070
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:24,312
Thirty years. Thirty years
of pounding beats and riding cars.

1071
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:26,314
Thirty years
of dirt and crummy pay!

1072
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,817
Thirty years I gave my life
to this department!

1073
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,777
And you allow this foreigner
to accuse me!

1074
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,362
We were just giving you
a chance to answer!

1075
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:33,989
Answer?
Why do I have to answer him?

1076
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,408
No, sir.
I won't take back that badge

1077
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:40,078
until the people of this county
vote it back!

1078
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,622
- Oh!
- Hank, will you listen a minute?

1079
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:46,710
I don't want to ever see that man in
headquarters for any reason at any time!

1080
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,336
- Now, you backed him up...
- Me?

1081
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,672
You stood by
while he impugned the integrity

1082
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,757
- of Captain Quinlan and Sgt. Menzies!
- I tried to stop him!

1083
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:55,093
Do you realise
what Vargas has done?

1084
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:57,387
He's smearing
hundreds of fine men.

1085
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,181
- Men ready to give their lives.
- Have you caused enough trouble?

1086
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,641
Are you satisfied?

1087
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,393
- I want you to apologise!
- To Quinlan?

1088
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,519
And to Chief Gould.

1089
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,146
Would you like me
to get down on my knees?

1090
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,398
If you have any decency,
you will, yes! You'll crawl!

1091
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:12,694
Mr Adair, I won't give you the chance
to test your authority in this matter.

1092
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,745
Al, have I still any credit
left with you?

1093
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,913
Some.

1094
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,543
Tell me, where can I find the records
of Quinlan's old cases?

1095
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:29,878
I'll show you.

1096
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:33,048
I'd like to get back to my wife.
I hope this won't take too long.

1097
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:34,924
- Hank?
- Hmm?

1098
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,676
You're not going without this.

1099
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:47,729
Well, now I guess I can talk.

1100
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,566
- What do you mean, Hank?
- Well, all I wanted to tell you was,

1101
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,818
that I couldn't really say
in my own defence that...

1102
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:54,986
Go on, Hank.

1103
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,655
What do you really know
about this Vargas?

1104
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:01,534
Isn't he in charge of some kind of
clean-up here on this side of the border?

1105
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,162
- Narcotics mainly?
- Yeah. Narcotics.

1106
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,248
He's a drug addict.

1107
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,543
He's got that young wife of his
hooked, too.

1108
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:15,757
But good. If I hadn't seen that
hypodermic myself...

1109
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:19,219
- Hypodermic? You saw it?
- I just said so, didn't I?

1110
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,096
I saw it.

1111
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,933
That's how come he happened to imagine
all those crazy things. It's typical.

1112
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,729
That's what that wife of his
was doing in that dive on skid row.

1113
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:32,857
Both a couple of junkies.
Of course, he's using the job...

1114
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,193
as a cover-up.

1115
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:39,280
You don't mean he's mixed up
in this dope racket himself?

1116
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:41,991
Hank, if this is just one
of your hunches...

1117
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,369
I don't ask you to believe it!
I can prove it!

1118
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,538
I know it isn't my department, but...

1119
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,627
I'd like to show you I'm not talking
out of the back of my neck.

1120
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:54,003
Just be careful, huh?

1121
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,422
Chief, I'll be very careful.

1122
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:02,554
This takes guts, Al.
Standing up to your boss this way.

1123
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,557
After today, amigo,
you can do me a favour.

1124
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,809
- Help me look for an office.
- How's that?

1125
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:11,771
Hank Quinlan's famous intuition might
still turn out to be better than yours.

1126
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:16,317
If so, my intuition tells me
I'll be going back to private practice.

1127
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:20,947
- Here are the other names you want.
- Look, Al, I can finish this alone.

1128
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:22,949
Yes, and maybe you can't.

1129
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:26,494
Well, let me try, anyway.

1130
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,539
I have no right
to drag you further into this.

1131
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,915
Gonna do it alone, huh?

1132
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,584
All you got to do
is solve the murder

1133
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,837
and also prove that the idol
of the police force is a fraud,

1134
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,425
Amigo, you've got your work
really cut out for you.

1135
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,434
Hello, Tana?
Is Captain Quinlan there?

1136
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,479
- Now, Sergeant.
- Tana!

1137
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,190
- Hey, Tana!
- I'll be right there.

1138
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,153
Now, what would Hank Quinlan
be doing here?

1139
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:44,739
'Used to be he'd hole up at your place
for two or three days

1140
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,616
'with a case of whiskey.'

1141
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:50,036
That was years ago.
Now he's on candy bars.

1142
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:51,621
Not tonight, he isn't.

1143
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,098
Let me stay. I want to watch.

1144
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,852
Hold her legs.

1145
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,481
No, no, let me go!

1146
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:03,651
Don't touch me!
Let me go! No!

1147
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:05,528
- No! No!
- Close the door!

1148
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,794
So, this is where you've been
all afternoon. Hmm?

1149
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,716
How'd they let you in here?
A foreigner.

1150
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,845
The Hall of Records is open
to the public, Sergeant.

1151
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:32,347
What're you doing?

1152
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,767
- You'll find out tomorrow morning.
- I want to know now.

1153
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,566
What's all this?

1154
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,193
Records of every case

1155
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:48,363
where you or Quinlan
uncovered the principal evidence.

1156
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,532
In each case,
as you'll notice,

1157
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,535
the defence denied
the existence of that evidence.

1158
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:58,039
What are you trying to do?
Wreck him?

1159
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,833
Him? What about you?

1160
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,630
Are you telling me you never planted
any evidence, Sergeant?

1161
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,466
Of course not.
Neither did Hank.

1162
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:11,135
It's all there.
The axe in the Berger slaying.

1163
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:13,179
The dentures in the Ewell case.

1164
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,723
Planting evidence,
framing suspects!

1165
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:18,559
- That's a lie.
- I think I can prove it, Sergeant.

1166
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:21,145
Sure... you can smear him.

1167
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:24,690
Ruin his whole life's work.

1168
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,779
Vargas, I...
I don't even know where he is.

1169
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,657
That's what you've done to him.

1170
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,451
- What I've done to him?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1171
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:39,122
He's on an important case
and he's disappeared.

1172
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,833
Good and drunk probably.

1173
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:45,920
After twelve years on the wagon.

1174
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,673
That's what you've done to him.

1175
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,054
What about Quinlan, Sergeant?

1176
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:57,515
What's he done?

1177
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:02,019
What about all those people
he put in the death house?

1178
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,107
Save your tears for them.

1179
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:15,032
♪ When the roll is called up yonder

1180
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:18,369
♪ When the roll... ♪

1181
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,466
What seems to be the trouble?

1182
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,134
- Trouble?
- The lights.

1183
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:36,387
The lights seem to be out
in all the cabins.

1184
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:38,014
Yeah. Yeah, yes, sir.

1185
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:43,728
Somebody's been
monkeying with them fuses.

1186
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:47,315
They think I'm gonna fix 'em,
they got another think comin'.

1187
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:51,068
It ain't my job to fix 'em,
even if I know how. I'm the night man.

1188
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,821
Could you show me please
to my wife's cabin?

1189
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,451
No...

1190
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,704
There's nobody here.

1191
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:04,457
You must be mistaken, sir.

1192
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:08,169
My wife has been registered here
since this morning.

1193
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,090
- My name is Vargas.
- Vargas?

1194
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:16,135
Would you look, please,
in the register?

1195
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:17,929
The register?

1196
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,348
Well...

1197
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:29,315
- Um, that might be cabin six.
- Yes, possibly.

1198
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,527
- Maybe seven.
- Yes, here.

1199
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,578
May I?

1200
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:48,042
There's nobody been
registered all week.

1201
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:52,213
No, no, it's off the season.

1202
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,300
Nobody hardly ever
comes around at all.

1203
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,262
I... I'm the night man.

1204
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,313
Oh, there was that party...

1205
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,233
Party? What party?

1206
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:18,072
- It's a mess. Awful mess.
- Where?

1207
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:21,242
They think I'm gonna clean it up,
they got another think comin'.

1208
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,077
Terrible, terrible brawl.

1209
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,499
Cabin number seven.

1210
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,379
Right in the middle
of the afternoon.

1211
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,214
Cabin number seven.

1212
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:45,474
This brawl...

1213
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,893
You mean there was
some sort of a fight?

1214
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,479
- Fight?
- Yes.

1215
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:54,692
No, no, it wasn't
that kind of a brawl.

1216
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:04,452
It was one of them wild parties.
You know the kind?

1217
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:27,058
This can't be my wife's room.

1218
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,186
This ain't her clothes, huh? Phew!

1219
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,229
It stinks in here!

1220
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,442
Let's get some air in here. Phew!

1221
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:43,032
It's a mess. It's a stinkin' mess!
Having their wild parties.

1222
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,035
There's my briefcase.
I left it with Susan. It...

1223
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,955
A stub here.

1224
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:55,294
I'm getting out of here.

1225
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:58,381
My gun!

1226
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:02,259
You haven't been here?

1227
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,679
You haven't been in that room?

1228
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:07,264
No, I just looked in.

1229
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:09,183
I had a gun in this case!

1230
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:12,228
You didn't take it?

1231
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,897
What would I want with a gun?

1232
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:17,233
Well, somebody wanted it!

1233
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:21,237
If they hadn't put that Grandi boy
on the desk this morning,

1234
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,864
- none of this would've happened.
- Grandi?

1235
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:27,118
Well, who do you think
this belongs to, anyway?

1236
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,703
Where are they?

1237
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,206
- The kids?
- Yes.

1238
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:33,624
Please.

1239
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,043
Gr-Gr-Gr-Gr... Rancho!

1240
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:38,587
- Rancho Grande?
- Yes!

1241
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,330
You got her undressed?

1242
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:16,459
Yeah. We've scattered
more reefer stubs around.

1243
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:20,629
You kids didn't use
none of that stuff yourself, huh?

1244
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,465
Think we're crazy?

1245
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:25,301
Nobody in the Grandi family
gets hooked.

1246
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,886
Understand? That's the rule.

1247
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,138
We blew the smoke
on her clothes, that's all.

1248
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:32,016
Like you said.
We put on a good show to scare her.

1249
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:34,727
Let's hope it was good enough.

1250
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:39,815
When she wakes up, she's gonna think
maybe something really did happen.

1251
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,693
All right, now beat it.

1252
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:44,320
What about our dough?

1253
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,239
We were not doing it for fun,
Uncle Joe.

1254
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:50,117
Beat it, beat it.
You're gonna get your dough tomorrow.

1255
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,744
OK.

1256
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,370
Beat it.

1257
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,221
Psst.

1258
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,432
OK.

1259
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,454
- Turn out the light.
- Why?

1260
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,460
Nobody can see you up here.

1261
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,131
- You sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.

1262
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,557
Hey, what are you doing?

1263
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:58,644
I brought you up here
for a reason.

1264
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,229
I don't get it.

1265
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,067
I don't even see why
you wanted us to bring her

1266
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,403
all the way into town here.

1267
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:11,532
I couldn't drive out to the motel,
my car is known.

1268
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:14,201
So what?
You're a cop making an arrest.

1269
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:16,036
Oh, the vice boys'll do that.

1270
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,789
What's that for?

1271
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:26,547
Turn around.

1272
01:21:31,928 --> 01:21:33,178
Get the phone.

1273
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:35,055
The phone.

1274
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,353
Now dial one-two-one-two.

1275
01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:44,523
- That's the police station.
- Go on, dial it.

1276
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:50,571
- Stop, Quinlan. You're drunk.
- Huh.

1277
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,823
Just stop and think for a minute.

1278
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:56,827
See if they answer.

1279
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,082
Hello?

1280
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:05,169
Ask for Sergeant Menzies.
Menzies.

1281
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,339
Sergeant Menzies.

1282
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:14,929
Quinlan, if you turn me in,
I'll have quite a story to tell.

1283
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:19,350
Yeah, you sure will.

1284
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,769
See if Menzies is...

1285
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,520
Hello? Menzies?

1286
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,230
Got him?

1287
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,608
Hand me the phone.
Hold it so I can talk now.

1288
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,318
Give me the receiver.
Give me the receiver.

1289
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:32,404
Hello, Pete.

1290
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:37,076
Of course it's me, partner.

1291
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,494
Any news yet?

1292
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,080
Sanchez still hasn't broken.

1293
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,249
What?

1294
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,044
Vargas's wife?

1295
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,462
A narcotics rap?

1296
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:53,300
Oh, one of the boys who was on this
wild party gave me the buzz, see?

1297
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:58,806
Now, just relay it to the vice boys
as anonymous.

1298
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:02,393
The Hotel Ritz, room 18.

1299
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,979
The way I hear it,
things got a little out of control.

1300
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:08,232
Don't be surprised...
what they find.

1301
01:23:09,275 --> 01:23:10,901
But what about me, Hank?

1302
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:12,778
What do I do?

1303
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,447
Keep after him!
Break him! Break him!

1304
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,369
- Put up the phone!
- Put up the...

1305
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:24,289
Receiver.

1306
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,125
Now, give me the key.

1307
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:41,265
Told you I brought you up here
for a reason.

1308
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:39,656
No, don't!

1309
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:28,497
Help!

1310
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,710
Help!
Somebody help me!

1311
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:39,424
Help! Somebody
come up here, please!

1312
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:44,513
Help me!

1313
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:08,412
Mike!

1314
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,128
Oh, talk English, can't you?

1315
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,923
Listen, I'm no cop now,
I'm a husband.

1316
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:44,967
What did you do with her?

1317
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,386
Where is my wife? My wife?

1318
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,321
Vargas!

1319
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:09,199
It's your wife, Vargas.

1320
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:11,451
They picked her up.

1321
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,246
What do you mean,
picked her up?

1322
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:15,789
The Vice Squad.

1323
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,125
Quinlan?

1324
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,628
You better come outside
with me, amigo.

1325
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,593
Now, tell me what happened.

1326
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,848
They found her at the Hotel Ritz
half-naked on one of the beds, drugged.

1327
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,058
- There were reefer stubs and a heroin fix.
- No.

1328
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:36,393
Vargas!

1329
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,397
The charge isn't just
possession of narcotics.

1330
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:41,648
What is it then?

1331
01:28:41,774 --> 01:28:42,983
Murder.

1332
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:45,444
Murder?

1333
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,461
Susie.

1334
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,546
Susie, darling.

1335
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:07,007
It's all right now, Susie. Sue.

1336
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:13,555
It's all down in the report.
They found evidence of a mixed party.

1337
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:15,849
Mixed party?

1338
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:19,895
Articles of clothing,
half-smoked reefers, needle marks.

1339
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:22,147
Something else
could produce the same effects.

1340
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:24,775
Demerol, for instance,
or Sodium Pentothal.

1341
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,360
You could smell the stuff on her.

1342
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,237
Listen, this whole set-up stinks.

1343
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,198
Who the hell
does Quinlan think he is?

1344
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:34,868
- Hanging a murder rap on my wife!
- Mike. Mike.

1345
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:37,704
- Mike.
- Susie, lie down.

1346
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,581
- Mike...
- Now, now.

1347
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,459
- It's all right, Susie.
- Mike.

1348
01:29:42,585 --> 01:29:47,381
- Take me home. Mike. Mike.
- Yes. Susie? Susie?

1349
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,091
Forgive me.

1350
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:55,889
Mike?

1351
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,850
Don't go.

1352
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:02,104
I'm right here, Susie.
It's all right.

1353
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:28,213
You understand, Vargas, there's
no formal charge against your wife.

1354
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:29,339
Oh?

1355
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:31,133
Even the vice boys
are not pressing anything.

1356
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,927
Oh, the fact that Susan
won't actually serve time

1357
01:30:34,053 --> 01:30:35,762
makes everything all right,
is that it?

1358
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:37,305
I told you I got something
to show you!

1359
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:40,767
Her family? Her good name?
Nothing's been touched by all this...

1360
01:30:40,893 --> 01:30:42,310
filth!

1361
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,003
I found that in the hotel room.

1362
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:10,547
Yeah.

1363
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:14,050
With Grandi's body.

1364
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:15,153
He's still just sitting in there.
Here, give me that.

1365
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:16,947
We've been waiting
three hours already.

1366
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:20,408
We won't get a word out of this,
as long as he's near that piano.

1367
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,453
If you would just go in
and shut it off.

1368
01:32:23,579 --> 01:32:25,455
He'll never stand for that.

1369
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:28,333
- I have to get him out of there.
- Give me the microphone.

1370
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:30,168
Vargas, I can take care
of this thing.

1371
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:32,170
Not without me.

1372
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,047
You know, I was just checking
with the Department.

1373
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:36,216
You know that Grandi kid
we picked up?

1374
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,635
- Stand quietly.
- He started to talk.

1375
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,179
He says the kids were all faking.

1376
01:32:41,305 --> 01:32:44,140
- They didn't give your wife any real dope.
- Here's the antenna.

1377
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:47,519
The doc says
it was only that truth stuff.

1378
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,772
- Sodium Pentothal.
- Yeah, no harm in it at all.

1379
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:51,940
No harm?

1380
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:55,318
Schwartz is driving your car
across the border.

1381
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:57,320
I told him
we'll be by the bridge here.

1382
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,656
He's bringing your wife along.

1383
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:02,158
She's feeling fine.

1384
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:04,578
- The doc says she can travel.
- Sergeant...

1385
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:07,622
Look, all she wants is to catch
the early plane out of here.

1386
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:11,710
How can I leave here
until my wife's name is clean? Clean!

1387
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,212
What do you think
you're carrying that microphone for?

1388
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:18,049
- Now remember, don't cross your arms.
- I know, I know, I know.

1389
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:21,219
I've got to get the truth from Quinlan.
All on tape.

1390
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:24,055
He could stay there
the rest of the week, like he used to.

1391
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,017
Now, look, why don't you
just take your wife home

1392
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:29,144
and let me handle this thing?
It's my job.

1393
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,854
It's my job too, Menzies.

1394
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,898
- 'It's my job.'
- 'It's my job too, Menzies.'

1395
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,027
You think I like it?
I hate this machine.

1396
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:39,904
- Spying, creeping around back alleys.
- How do you think I feel?

1397
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:42,198
Hank is the best friend I ever had.

1398
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:44,534
That's one reason for my staying.

1399
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,536
Oh, you don't trust me, huh?

1400
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:48,663
Don't forget, I was the one
that showed you that cane.

1401
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:50,624
I didn't have to do it,
you know.

1402
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:55,003
- Oh, yes you did, Sergeant.
- Somebody could have planted it there.

1403
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:57,672
- Menzies...
- Besides Grandi's corpse.

1404
01:33:57,798 --> 01:33:59,674
You know better than that.

1405
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,761
You say the reefers were planted.
Why not Hank's cane?

1406
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,929
You're an honest cop.

1407
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,473
Sure, I am.

1408
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:10,518
And who made me an honest cop?
Hank Quinlan.

1409
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,103
Come on, Menzies.

1410
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:14,314
I am what I am because of him.

1411
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:24,949
What's my fortune?

1412
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:34,542
You been reading the cards,
haven't you?

1413
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,503
I've been doing the accounts.

1414
01:34:38,881 --> 01:34:41,299
Come on.
Read my future for me.

1415
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,096
You haven't got any.

1416
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,474
Hmm? What do you mean?

1417
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:53,478
Your future is all used up.

1418
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:01,945
Why don't you go home?

1419
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,423
Vargas? Vargas?

1420
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:24,342
'I don't know if you can hear me
over that piano music,

1421
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:26,302
'but I'll get him out of there
so you can hear.'

1422
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:00,962
I'll get him out.
Away from that music.

1423
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,672
Be sure he doesn't see you.

1424
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,178
I must be drunk.

1425
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:12,265
A minute ago...

1426
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:15,477
I thought you were Vargas.

1427
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,937
Come on out, Hank!

1428
01:36:18,063 --> 01:36:20,523
- What's that?
- Come on out, Hank. I'm tired.

1429
01:36:20,649 --> 01:36:23,359
- Who told you to come here?
- I'm tired of waiting, Hank.

1430
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:25,236
There's some questions
you got to answer.

1431
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:29,949
Questions?

1432
01:36:31,076 --> 01:36:32,702
I need another drink.

1433
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:34,996
You had enough.

1434
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:38,958
That's what Tana keeps telling me.
How much is enough?

1435
01:36:42,671 --> 01:36:45,507
'Hank, I'm sick of chasing around
trying to get at the truth.'

1436
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,967
'You could use a drink
yourself, partner.'

1437
01:36:48,093 --> 01:36:49,260
'You got to answer, Hank.

1438
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:52,096
'All kinds of things.
First, about Vargas's gun.'

1439
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,515
'How do you know about the gun? '

1440
01:36:56,852 --> 01:36:59,312
- 'He thinks you took it.'
- 'Vargas? '

1441
01:36:59,438 --> 01:37:02,106
'Or was it Grandi that stole it? '

1442
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:05,819
- 'You been talking to Vargas, huh? '
- 'And then you took it from Grandi? '

1443
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:09,155
'You've been getting kind of chummy,
you and that Mexican.'

1444
01:37:09,281 --> 01:37:11,991
Does that explain that thing
you're carrying around now?

1445
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:15,453
What's it called?

1446
01:37:16,121 --> 01:37:18,289
'That thing you're wearing? '

1447
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:22,585
- What I'm wearing?
- Sure.

1448
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:26,089
- That halo.
- Halo?

1449
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:28,341
Looks real pretty on you, Pete.

1450
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,055
Pretty soon you'll be
flapping your wings like an angel.

1451
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:41,563
'Look out.'

1452
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:46,985
Vargas'll turn you into one of these
here starry-eyed idealists.

1453
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:49,988
'They're the ones making
all the real trouble in the world.

1454
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:51,614
'Be careful.'
They're worse than crooks.

1455
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:53,908
You can always do something
with a crook.

1456
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:57,078
You're the one who should be careful,
Hank. Dealing with crooks.

1457
01:37:57,204 --> 01:37:59,205
'Sometimes you can turn
into a crook yourself.

1458
01:37:59,331 --> 01:38:04,085
- 'Look what happened with Grandi.'
- 'Partner, nobody ever called me a crook.'

1459
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:11,175
Look. Look up there.

1460
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:13,595
See?

1461
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:18,474
That oil pump
pumping up money.

1462
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,313
Money.

1463
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:25,106
Don't you think
I could've been rich?

1464
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:27,525
A cop in my position?

1465
01:38:27,651 --> 01:38:29,402
- What do I have?
- Tell me about Grandi...

1466
01:38:29,528 --> 01:38:34,365
After thirty years... my little turkey ranch.
That's all I got. A couple of acres.

1467
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:36,492
We got to talk about Grandi.

1468
01:38:40,122 --> 01:38:41,873
'An honest cop! '

1469
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:44,834
Then this Mexican comes along,
and look at the spot he puts me in!

1470
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,211
You can't blame Vargas
for what happened to Grandi.

1471
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:52,967
- I blame Vargas for everything.
- Hank, don't be crazy!

1472
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:54,093
Crazy?

1473
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:57,639
'If it wasn't for him,
do you think I'd be in a situation

1474
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,140
'where Grandi
could blackmail me?

1475
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:00,975
'Then of course,
when I had to defend myself... '

1476
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:03,102
'Defend yourself?
Hank, you must be crazy! '

1477
01:39:03,228 --> 01:39:05,063
- 'Sure, sure, I'm crazy.'
- 'Insane! '

1478
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:07,482
'Defend yourself! Hank.

1479
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:09,192
'You murdered Grandi.

1480
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:12,195
'I left my cane by his body.
That was sure crazy.'

1481
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:15,698
All right, let's start
in the beginning.

1482
01:39:15,824 --> 01:39:17,116
What about Vargas's gun?

1483
01:39:17,242 --> 01:39:19,202
I was talking about my cane.

1484
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:21,329
- The gun!
- I forgot it.

1485
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:23,915
- The gun you stole from his briefcase!
- Gun? Gun?

1486
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:26,918
- Vargas's gun! Vargas's!
- Vargas! Vargas! Vargas!

1487
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:29,295
All you want to talk about
is Vargas!

1488
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,426
You took the gun from his briefcase,
but you didn't use it.

1489
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,513
- 'Grandi was strangled.'
- 'Grandi was a crook.'

1490
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,056
'You're a killer, Hank.'

1491
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:42,225
Partner, I'm a cop.

1492
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:43,977
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1493
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:47,271
Drunk and crazy as you must have been
when you strangled him.

1494
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:51,025
I guess you were somehow
thinking of your wife.

1495
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:52,902
The way she was strangled.

1496
01:39:53,028 --> 01:39:55,822
Well, I'm always thinking of her,

1497
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:57,699
drunk or sober.

1498
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:01,536
What else is there to think about?

1499
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:05,123
Except my job. My dirty job!

1500
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:09,961
- You didn't have to make it dirty.
- I don't call it dirty! Look at the record.

1501
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:13,589
- 'Our record, partner! Huh? '
- 'Sure, sure, sure.'

1502
01:40:13,716 --> 01:40:17,593
Well, all those convictions.

1503
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,847
Convictions, sure.
How many did you frame?

1504
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:21,973
'Nobody.'

1505
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:23,766
Come on, Hank.
How many did you frame?

1506
01:40:23,892 --> 01:40:26,019
I told you. Nobody.

1507
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:28,896
Nobody that wasn't guilty.

1508
01:40:29,773 --> 01:40:33,276
Guilty.

1509
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:37,947
Every last one of them.
Guilty.

1510
01:40:39,366 --> 01:40:42,285
All these years you've been
playing me for a sucker,

1511
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:43,828
'faking evidence.'

1512
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:45,580
'Aiding justice, partner.'

1513
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,582
Yeah, like the axe
in the Berger case.

1514
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,250
Oh, yeah, remember that?

1515
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:51,085
I was the one
that found the axe.

1516
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:53,379
Just where
you planted it for me to find.

1517
01:40:53,505 --> 01:40:55,590
Just like the dynamite
with Sanchez.

1518
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:58,801
- Just like you planted that dynamite!
- Don't you think Sanchez is guilty?

1519
01:40:58,927 --> 01:41:00,636
He's guilty. He'll confess.

1520
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:04,891
Hey, listen to that.

1521
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:10,063
- Hank, I'm gonna have to...
- Shut up.

1522
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:11,898
Hear that?

1523
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:15,568
- Hear what?
- Like an echo.

1524
01:41:26,288 --> 01:41:27,747
Vargas?

1525
01:41:31,543 --> 01:41:33,795
'I got a feeling
he's someplace around here.'

1526
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:37,965
Close to me.

1527
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:40,635
I got a hunch.

1528
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:44,180
- Why Vargas? Wh-Wh-Why should he...
- You sound kind of nervous, Pete.

1529
01:41:47,559 --> 01:41:49,310
No, my game leg...

1530
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,107
is starting to talk to me.

1531
01:41:57,611 --> 01:41:59,237
Vargas.

1532
01:42:06,245 --> 01:42:09,163
Maybe he's tailing me with a bug.

1533
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:13,960
Recording...

1534
01:42:15,712 --> 01:42:18,798
Hey, are you carrying a bug for him?
A microphone?

1535
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:20,883
- Hank, I...
- Don't lie to me!

1536
01:42:21,009 --> 01:42:23,302
All right, all right now!
You'd better give me that gun.

1537
01:42:23,428 --> 01:42:26,347
'Where is he? Where is he? '

1538
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:28,683
How did you figure
to frame Vargas with it?

1539
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:30,518
Framed? Who's been framed?

1540
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:32,061
'Where is he?

1541
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:34,689
'Vargas? '

1542
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:36,190
- Where is he?
- Hank, look, I...

1543
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:37,650
'I'm talking to Vargas now.'

1544
01:42:37,776 --> 01:42:39,610
Vargas? Do you hear me?

1545
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:42,155
I'm talking to you.

1546
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:45,366
Through this walking microphone
that used to work for me.

1547
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:47,160
- No, I ain't working for Vargas.
- Vargas, Vargas.

1548
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:50,454
'I'm working for the Department, Hank.
Better give me Vargas's gun.'

1549
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:51,706
- 'OK, here it is.'
- Give it to me!

1550
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,166
'Vargas! '

1551
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:57,712
Hank.

1552
01:42:58,505 --> 01:42:59,714
Hank...

1553
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:50,848
Well, Captain...

1554
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:55,645
I'm afraid this is finally something
you can't talk your way out of.

1555
01:43:57,606 --> 01:43:59,065
You want to bet?

1556
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:04,528
You killed him, Vargas.

1557
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:07,406
Come on, now.
Give me my gun back.

1558
01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:12,411
You don't understand me.
You killed Pete.

1559
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:15,998
The bullet is from your gun.

1560
01:44:18,001 --> 01:44:19,835
You think anyone
would believe that?

1561
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:21,796
They always believe me.

1562
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:26,050
Anyway, they'd never believe
I killed him.

1563
01:44:27,135 --> 01:44:30,012
- The gun?
- You're resisting arrest.

1564
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:34,850
How could you arrest me here?
This is my country.

1565
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:38,688
And this is where you're gonna die.

1566
01:44:44,653 --> 01:44:47,738
That was no miss, Vargas!
That was just to turn you around!

1567
01:44:47,864 --> 01:44:49,782
I don't want to shoot you
in the back.

1568
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:54,578
Unless you'd rather
try to run for it.

1569
01:45:18,645 --> 01:45:19,645
Schwartz!

1570
01:45:19,771 --> 01:45:22,106
Is she there?
Did you bring my wife?

1571
01:45:22,232 --> 01:45:23,357
She's in the car.

1572
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:24,984
That's Menzies. He's dead.

1573
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:27,320
Quinlan's been shot, too.
He's lying by the recorder.

1574
01:45:27,446 --> 01:45:29,613
Down there!
I've got it all on tape.

1575
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,365
- You sure you got enough?
- More than enough.

1576
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:33,034
Go play it back. You'll see.

1577
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,792
- Susie.
- Oh, Mike.

1578
01:45:46,798 --> 01:45:50,217
'All these years
you've been playing me for a sucker...

1579
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,386
'faking evidence.'

1580
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:54,513
'Aiding justice, partner.'

1581
01:45:56,308 --> 01:45:57,850
Hank!

1582
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,978
- Susie.
- Oh, Mike.

1583
01:46:02,314 --> 01:46:05,983
It's all over, Susie.
I'm taking you home. Home...

1584
01:46:09,988 --> 01:46:14,575
- 'How many did you frame? '
- 'Nobody that wasn't guilty. Guilty.'

1585
01:46:14,701 --> 01:46:15,785
Hank!

1586
01:46:15,911 --> 01:46:18,871
- 'No, I ain't working for Vargas.'
- 'Vargas, Vargas! '

1587
01:46:18,997 --> 01:46:21,123
- 'Hank, you better give me that gun.'
- 'OK, here it is.'

1588
01:46:21,249 --> 01:46:23,167
- 'Give it to me.'
- 'Vargas! '

1589
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:31,300
Pete, that's the second bullet
I stopped for you.

1590
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:55,324
His famous intuition was right,
after all.

1591
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:58,702
He framed that Mexican kid, Sanchez,
but he didn't even need to.

1592
01:46:58,829 --> 01:47:00,621
The kid confessed
about that bomb.

1593
01:47:01,665 --> 01:47:05,334
So, it turns out
Quinlan was right, after all.

1594
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:10,047
Isn't somebody going to come
and take him away?

1595
01:47:10,173 --> 01:47:11,757
Yeah, in just a few minutes.

1596
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:13,884
You really liked him, didn't you?

1597
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:17,304
The cop did.

1598
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:19,056
The one who killed him.

1599
01:47:19,182 --> 01:47:20,182
He loved him.

1600
01:47:20,308 --> 01:47:23,686
Well, Hank was a great detective,
all right.

1601
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:25,438
And a lousy cop.

1602
01:47:26,231 --> 01:47:27,815
Is that all
you have to say for him?

1603
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:31,235
He was some kind of a man.

1604
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:37,241
What does it matter
what you say about people?

1605
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:46,083
Goodbye, Tana.

1606
01:47:47,627 --> 01:47:49,044
Adios.
