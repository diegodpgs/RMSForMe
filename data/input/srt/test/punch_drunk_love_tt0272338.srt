1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,199
- Yes, I'm still on hold.
- And what was this?

2
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,412
I'm looking at your advertisement
for the airline giveaway.

3
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:39,121
Our frequent flyer plan.

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,750
It's hard to understand
because it says, "In addition to"...

5
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:48,297
...but I can't understand in addition
to what? There's nothing to add it to.

6
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:50,507
I think that's a typo, then.

7
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:53,510
Okay, so just to clarify, I'm sorry...

8
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:57,555
...10 purchases of Healthy Choice
products equals 500 miles.

9
00:00:57,764 --> 00:01:01,434
And with the coupon, the same
purchases value 1000 miles?

10
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:02,685
That's it.

11
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:06,314
Do you realize that
the monetary value of this prize...

12
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:10,484
...is potentially worth more
than the purchases?

13
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:13,946
I don't know.

14
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:22,287
Could I call you back? Could I ask
you your extension and name?

15
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,707
It's extension 215,
and the name is Carter.

16
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:28,793
Carter. Thank you very much, Carter.

17
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:31,629
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

18
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:09,053
- I'm not sure what that means.
- If they break, is it plastic?

19
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,930
It's plastic, yeah.

20
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:16,227
But that kind of breakage shouldn't be
a problem in the shipping room.

21
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:18,813
I'm gonna run the numbers.
I'll give you a call.

22
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,566
- You have my home phone number?
- What's that for?

23
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:24,860
If you wanted to call me.

24
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,154
I'm fine.
I have your work number.

25
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:32,117
Because of the time difference,
if you needed to reach me earlier--

26
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:35,370
No, it's fine. I can just
get you at your office.

27
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:36,538
- Okay.
- Okay.

28
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:37,705
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

29
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:39,123
Bye-bye.

30
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,964
- Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
- No.

31
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:35,509
- They're not open yet.
- They don't get open until 8:00.

32
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:38,262
Is it okay if I leave
my car, you think?

33
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,597
I don't know. I don't know.

34
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:43,684
I thought they opened at 7.

35
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,396
If I left my car, would it be okay?

36
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:49,981
See, I don't know how they do it.

37
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:52,984
- Do you know them?
- Not very well.

38
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:55,695
Could I trust to leave
my key with you...

39
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,948
...so when they get here,
you could give it to them?

40
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,867
Okay, sure.

41
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:13,003
- You think it's okay where I've left it?
- It'll be fine. I can watch it.

42
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:16,214
- Thanks a lot.
- I'll keep an eye on it.

43
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:22,845
- There's a piano in the street.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,224
Maybe I'll see you later.
Thank you for your help.

45
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:28,517
Thank you.

46
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:32,855
- Maybe I'll see you later.
- Okay.

47
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,383
Morning, Barry.

48
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:04,595
- You okay?
- Yes.

49
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,014
- Why are you wearing a suit?
- I bought one.

50
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:13,978
I thought it'd be nice to get dressed
for work, and I'm not sure why.

51
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:19,525
- May I please show you something?
- Sure.

52
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:25,030
What's this?

53
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,496
I believe this is a small piano.

54
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:35,165
It's not a piano.
I got a piano at home.

55
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,459
Where did you get it?

56
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,296
It was dropped in the street.

57
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,549
Why is it here?

58
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:47,468
Barry?

59
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:51,347
Barry?

60
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,182
Morning, Barry.

61
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,350
I don't know.

62
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,096
Great product.

63
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:38,724
I have to make sure I don't end
up with extra inventory.

64
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,811
Can you guarantee all your sales?

65
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:47,316
We back our funders 100%. We ask
for a 30-60 day display on the floor.

66
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:51,736
Barry, your sister's on line one.
Barry, your sister's on line one.

67
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:55,615
I don't think they'll be out
that long. I guarantee that.

68
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:58,743
Let me just get this, this is my sister.

69
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,287
It's not a problem.

70
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:03,164
- This is Barry.
- It's Rhonda.

71
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:06,042
- Are you going to this party tonight?
- Yes, I am.

72
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:10,546
- All right, fine. Bye.
- Bye-bye. I'll see you tonight.

73
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,132
Sorry about that.

74
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:19,012
We've received a large order from the
Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

75
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:23,308
We will be supplying their bathrooms
with the dice and money funder.

76
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,269
So these babies are really flying.

77
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:30,314
Barry, your sister's on line two.
Barry, your sister's on line two.

78
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,026
With the aquablast, little zippers,
whales and speedboats...

79
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,654
...we ask the display be at eye level.

80
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,865
- Barry.
- Let me just get that.

81
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:43,577
You know, you can also
color-coordinate these funders.

82
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,704
- This is Barry.
- What are you doing?

83
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:48,248
I have customers. I can't chat now.

84
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:51,000
Chat? Did you just say "chat"?

85
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:55,171
- Yeah, I can't talk--
- You just fucking said "chat."

86
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,673
What are you now? Chat.

87
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,218
I'm calling to make sure you
show up at this party.

88
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:02,928
- I'll be there.
- Okay, fine.

89
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:07,933
Then go back to chatting with your
customers, you phony, chatty shit.

90
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:09,726
All right, thank you.

91
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:11,895
Sorry about that.

92
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:14,064
- I didn't know you had a sister.
- I do.

93
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:17,191
I wanted to tell you
about the new funders.

94
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:22,071
We've been working on this, and we
have a nonbreakable handle, finally.

95
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:24,949
Let me demonstrate for you.

96
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:30,537
Okay, this was one of the old ones.
Do we have a new one around, Lance?

97
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:34,416
Sorry about that.
That's a little embarrassing.

98
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,751
Barry, your sister's on line four.

99
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:40,380
- So how many sisters do you have?
- I have seven.

100
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,257
Yes.

101
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:46,302
They're calling me because
they're having a party tonight.

102
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:49,221
I'll be two more minutes, okay?

103
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:55,686
- This is Barry.
- What are you doing?

104
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,062
Kathleen. I'm working.

105
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:58,897
- You going to the party?
- Yes.

106
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:01,108
- What are you doing?
- I'm working.

107
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:03,944
Yeah, but what are you doing?

108
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:06,529
I'm talking on the phone, standing.

109
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:08,740
- What time you gonna be there?
- 7.

110
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:11,576
- You can't be late. I'm serious.
- I won't.

111
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:16,080
You can't not show up like you do.
You have to go. Seriously.

112
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,625
- You can't just stay in your house.
- All right.

113
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:25,130
- I'll see you there? Don't puss out.
- See you there. Okay.

114
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:07,253
Is her car going to be okay?

115
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,880
- It's fine.
- Thanks.

116
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,343
Barry, it's your sister.

117
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:18,305
- Hi. How are you?
- Hey, Elizabeth.

118
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:19,890
- How's it going?
- Great.

119
00:14:20,056 --> 00:14:22,142
- Stopped by to say hello.
- Terrific.

120
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,310
- So you're going tonight?
- Yes.

121
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:25,812
- Cool.
- You're going?

122
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,024
Yes. I came by to talk to you
about something in particular.

123
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:35,112
There's this friend of mine who's
really cute, and I want you to meet her.

124
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,074
I was thinking about bringing
her tonight. What do you think?

125
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:42,869
Yeah, I don't wanna do that.

126
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:46,248
- Why?
- I just don't do stuff like that.

127
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:48,875
Well, you don't really do anything.

128
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:51,419
Everybody would be looking at me.

129
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:54,339
What's wrong with looking?
It's a free country.

130
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:59,885
I just feel like I'd be a little tense,
and I don't think I'd act like myself.

131
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:03,472
Well, that's kind of your fault.

132
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:09,978
There's an outside chance
I'm not even coming tonight.

133
00:15:11,354 --> 00:15:15,025
Really? Didn't you tell everybody
you were coming?

134
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:18,695
I have to renew
my gym membership.

135
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:22,573
Right. God, well, that
solves everything, actually.

136
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:26,410
If you're not coming, then I can
bring her. It's not a big deal.

137
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:30,039
Well, it'll be fine. Great.

138
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:34,251
- Please don't--
- I'm just trying to be your friend.

139
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:36,753
I hope you can make it.

140
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,343
Remember when Barry
used to get all mad?

141
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,971
Because Rhonda used
to call him "Gay Boy" all the time.

142
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:50,683
- That's right.
- Remember the sliding glass door?

143
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,394
He threw that hammer
through the door.

144
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:56,605
He got glass in his foot.
Mom took him to the hospital.

145
00:15:56,772 --> 00:16:01,401
He came home and locked himself
in the bathroom with the hammer.

146
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,905
- Hey, there he is.
- Hi.

147
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:10,451
We were talking about you. Remember
when we used to call you Gay Boy?

148
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,662
- What?
- We called you Gay Boy.

149
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,998
We'd call you Gay Boy,
and you'd just freak out.

150
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:19,919
You got so mad, you threw
the hammer through the glass door.

151
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:21,503
- You remember.
- I don't.

152
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,299
Yes, you do. We were calling you
Gay Boy, and you got mad.

153
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:27,509
Are you gay now?

154
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,302
I don't know.

155
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:32,180
We were trying to figure out
why you had a hammer.

156
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:35,475
- Why are you wearing that suit?
- I don't know.

157
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:37,143
- I like his suit.
- Thank you.

158
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,146
- Are you using that dandruff shampoo?
- Yes.

159
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:41,397
- You are?
- Barry?

160
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:45,359
- Why did you have the hammer?
- Why did I have the hammer?

161
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:49,321
- He was building a doghouse.
- Okay, Rhonda.

162
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:52,282
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks for coming.

163
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:55,494
- A cake. We have a cake.
- You got a cake.

164
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,539
Hey, I was just thinking about you.
Glad you could make it.

165
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:03,960
- Mr. Chatty. Hi, Mr. Chatty.
- You have rice in your hair.

166
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:06,379
Say hello to your
brother-in-laws.

167
00:17:06,546 --> 00:17:09,548
- Hey, Barry, how you doing?
- How you doing, pal?

168
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:12,301
- Good to see you.
- Saw your car. Snazzy.

169
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:15,971
- Hey, Barry, how you doing?
- I'm sorry!

170
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:17,639
- How you doing?
- How is it going?

171
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:19,308
How's work?

172
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:23,478
- Business is very food, thank you.
- What's very food?

173
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:26,898
- What's that?
- You just said "very food."

174
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:30,318
I'm sorry, I meant to say
"very good."

175
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:33,529
Maybe you said "food"
because you're hungry.

176
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:37,074
- You know, you want to eat.
- That makes sense.

177
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:43,330
Is your friend here?

178
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:46,375
No. You're off the hook.
She couldn't make it.

179
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,627
Thank you.

180
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,004
- You nervous?
- No.

181
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:54,090
- You look nervous.
- I feel very happy.

182
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:57,427
Good. Did you get
your gym membership?

183
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,220
Tomorrow.

184
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,142
I had a girl I was gonna bring
for Barry. He wouldn't let me do it.

185
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,480
I had this girl to bring for him.
She's awesome. We work together.

186
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:13,316
- He said he couldn't be himself.
- Gay Boy, it's time to eat.

187
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,610
- Who's he going to be?
- I don't know.

188
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:18,530
He's worried we'll give him
a bunch of shit.

189
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:21,449
He said he wouldn't come
if I brought her.

190
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:24,368
He's an asshole.
Why do you listen to him?

191
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:29,290
I don't know. I was gonna bring her.
It would've been totally casual.

192
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:31,500
Look at him.

193
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:41,009
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You fucking retard, Barry!

194
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:50,810
I'm sorry about that.
Sorry about what I did.

195
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:52,228
It's all right.

196
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:57,441
I wanted to ask you something
because you're a doctor, right?

197
00:18:58,484 --> 00:18:59,860
Yeah.

198
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:06,241
I don't like myself sometimes.

199
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,830
Can you help me?

200
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:18,169
Barry, I'm a dentist. What kind
of help do you think I can give you?

201
00:19:18,377 --> 00:19:21,964
I know. Maybe you know
other doctors?

202
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:23,424
Like a psychiatrist?

203
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:27,427
I just don't have anybody else
I can talk to about things...

204
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:31,306
...and I understand
it's confidential with a doctor.

205
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:35,101
And I just-- I don't want
my sisters to know, okay?

206
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,854
Because I'm embarrassed about this.

207
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,733
If it's about getting you
a phone number for a psychiatrist...

208
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,902
...I can do that. It's not a problem.

209
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:49,073
But what exactly is wrong?

210
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,909
I don't know
if there is anything wrong...

211
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:55,287
...because I don't
know how other people are.

212
00:19:55,996 --> 00:20:01,418
I sometimes cry a lot...

213
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:04,796
...for no reason.

214
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,559
I'm sorry.

215
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:04,060
$1.79.

216
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:34,922
What am I looking for?
What am I looking for?

217
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:37,257
Tell me. Talk to me.

218
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:40,927
Talk to me. Talk to me.

219
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:45,056
Pudding.

220
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,084
I see you, Richard Seelan, yes.

221
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,920
All right, Mr. Seelan.

222
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,515
Hi, this is Janice. Who's this?

223
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:30,974
Hi. How you doing?

224
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,186
- Hi. Is this your first time calling?
- Yes, it is.

225
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,647
Can I have your credit card number
and expiration date?

226
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,942
Sure. How much is this, anyways?

227
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:46,113
It's $2.99 per minute for the first
half-hour, $1.99 per minute after that.

228
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,617
- Okay, and it's confidential?
- What do you mean?

229
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:53,078
The information I give you
is private, confidential?

230
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:56,415
Of course, yeah.
Would you like to talk to a girl?

231
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,418
I can connect you with a girl if I can
have your credit card number...

232
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:03,088
...followed by the expiration date.

233
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:07,508
Sure. 5-1-0-2...

234
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:11,721
...1-7-1-7...

235
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:15,433
...8-1-1-8...

236
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,601
...6-5-5-4.

237
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,354
Expiration, 05-04.

238
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,815
Your billing address
and the name on the card.

239
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:29,738
1274 Moorpark,
Sherman Oaks, California...

240
00:23:29,904 --> 00:23:35,243
...Apartment 4. 91403, ZIP code.

241
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:38,120
- And your name?
- Barry Egan.

242
00:23:38,537 --> 00:23:40,831
And your social security number.

243
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:42,750
What for?

244
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:46,920
It's just for verification through
the credit card company.

245
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:49,589
And this is confidential?

246
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:53,760
It's to verify your credit information.
It's confidential.

247
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:57,013
It appears on your credit card
as D&D Mattress Man.

248
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,265
Very good.

249
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:01,893
9-1--

250
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:05,438
- I'm sorry, 9-1-7...
- It's okay.

251
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:07,982
...6-5...

252
00:24:09,024 --> 00:24:11,276
...5-0-1-2.

253
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:16,198
- Okay, so hang on, Barry, all right?
- Thank you very much.

254
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:22,829
We're all set.

255
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:26,791
Can I have the number
where we can call you back?

256
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:30,753
Could you possibly just connect me
to one of the girls?

257
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,882
Well, it's a callback service.
A girl will call you back.

258
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,635
I just was calling to speak
with one of the girls.

259
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:41,221
I thought that's how it worked.
I'm 8-1-8...

260
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:44,724
...7-7-5...

261
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,811
...3-9-9-3.

262
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:50,730
What kind of a girl
would you like to talk to?

263
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:55,151
I don't want anybody to know it's me.
I don't want them to know my name.

264
00:24:55,318 --> 00:24:58,946
- Nobody will know your name.
- Tell them my name's Jack.

265
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:03,283
- You want her to call you Jack?
- I don't want her to know it's me.

266
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:05,494
- Okay, Jack.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

267
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:08,330
- No problem. We'll call you right back.
- Terrific.

268
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:10,040
Okay.

269
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:42,237
Hello, this is Back.

270
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:45,156
I'm calling for Jack.

271
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:48,117
- How you doing?
- Hi. How are you doing?

272
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:50,286
- This is Jack.
- This is Georgia.

273
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:53,789
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing tonight?

274
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:56,166
Nothing. What are you doing?

275
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:59,628
I am laying on my bed.

276
00:25:59,795 --> 00:26:02,547
- Where are you?
- I'm in my bedroom.

277
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:06,885
- No, I mean what state, what city?
- I'm in California.

278
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:10,638
- Me too. I'm in California.
- I know you are. I'm in Los Angeles.

279
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:12,265
I'm in Los Angeles too.

280
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:16,811
Well, maybe we should hook up
sometime. What do you think?

281
00:26:17,394 --> 00:26:21,523
- Are you watching a porno movie?
- No, I'm not, Georgia.

282
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,569
- Do you like porno movies?
- Sure.

283
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,698
So Jack, are you stroking it?

284
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:31,741
No.

285
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:34,911
- What are you doing, then?
- I'm talking to you.

286
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:37,705
With your pants off?

287
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:40,625
No, my pants are on.

288
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,670
I'm only wearing a T-shirt
and panties.

289
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,506
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

290
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:51,301
And I'm looking at my shaved pussy
in the mirror.

291
00:26:51,468 --> 00:26:54,346
- Want to know what I look like?
- Doesn't matter.

292
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,514
What do you mean,
it doesn't matter?

293
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,893
I have no way of finding out,
so it doesn't matter.

294
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:06,148
I'm not lying to you, Jack.
I'm about 5 foot 8, 34-28-34.

295
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,401
- My friends say I'm gorgeous.
- Really?

296
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:12,112
- Yeah, really. What about you?
- That doesn't matter.

297
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,990
Yes, it does.

298
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,411
- You're married, aren't you?
- No.

299
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:22,831
- No? You have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

300
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:28,795
- Where is she?
- She went out of town.

301
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,963
Good, I like that.

302
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,842
- I'm so horny, Jack. What about you?
- Sure.

303
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,513
- Do you like peaches, Jack?
- They're okay.

304
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:43,976
Well, you'll like them even better
because I'm a Georgia peach.

305
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:48,271
- Are you jacking off yet, Jack?
- No, I'm not.

306
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:52,066
Well, do you ever?

307
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:55,278
Sometimes, yeah, when I'm lonely.

308
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:58,489
You don't have to be lonely,
because you got me now.

309
00:27:58,698 --> 00:28:03,494
You sound very nice
and very personable.

310
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:05,954
Personable. Thank you, baby.

311
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:08,332
So, what do you do, Barry?

312
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,795
I work. I have my own business.
I work hard at doing my business.

313
00:28:13,962 --> 00:28:16,339
- Are you good at your business?
- Yes.

314
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:21,219
Yeah? So do you do really well?
Do you make tons of money?

315
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:25,222
I'm doing pretty good,
I think, as a start.

316
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:30,269
I wish I was making more, doing better,
but I can't get over a certain hump.

317
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:35,315
I will. I'll crack something very soon,
I think, and really do better.

318
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,111
I'd like to diversify,
but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.

319
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:44,032
Are you stroking it yet, baby?

320
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:47,368
- No, I'm not.
- Is your cock hard?

321
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:49,954
I don't know what
it's doing right now.

322
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:54,124
Why don't you take
your clothes off, Jack.

323
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:59,630
And I want to picture you laying
down with me next to you...

324
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:03,633
...and I want you to stroke
your cock, okay?

325
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:11,975
I'm so horny, Barry. I want you.

326
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:36,664
- This is Barry.
- What are you doing? How are you?

327
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:40,585
- I'm fine. Nothing. How are you?
- It's me. It's Georgia.

328
00:29:42,295 --> 00:29:45,423
- How's it going?
- It's okay that I'm calling, right?

329
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:47,007
Sure.

330
00:29:47,174 --> 00:29:50,719
I just wanted to call
and thank you for last night...

331
00:29:50,928 --> 00:29:53,722
...and just catch you before you
went to work and say hey.

332
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:56,099
Well, thank you.

333
00:29:56,266 --> 00:30:00,061
I am so tired. I went to bed
so late last night.

334
00:30:00,228 --> 00:30:03,731
- When did you go to sleep?
- Not very late.

335
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:07,193
- Well, you going to work now?
- Yes.

336
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,196
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

337
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:14,783
Remember last night I was telling
you about my apartment and my rent?

338
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:16,285
Remember?

339
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:20,163
This is so weird and really
embarrassing for me...

340
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,377
...but I was wondering if you'd
help me out with some money.

341
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:28,421
- Me?
- Yeah.

342
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:32,383
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
I can't afford that.

343
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,052
But you don't even know
how much it is.

344
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:39,473
- How much is it?
- Like 750. Seven hundred and fifty.

345
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,435
Yeah, no, I can't
afford that. I'm sorry.

346
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:48,148
- Seriously?
- You're having financial trouble?

347
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:52,736
It's so hard these days,
and, yeah, I really need it.

348
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:57,407
Yeah, I just don't have enough
money to be able to do that. I'm sorry.

349
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:59,909
I thought you had your own business.

350
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:03,537
You said you were gonna
diversify and all that stuff.

351
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:05,956
So you think you can?

352
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,126
I'm sorry.

353
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:12,212
Maybe I should call back
and talk to your girlfriend?

354
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:15,590
Maybe it'd be better
to ask her for the money.

355
00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:19,469
It could be really easy, Barry.
I have all your information.

356
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:24,265
- Your credit card, your billing stuff--
- Okay. No, thank you.

357
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,521
- Morning, Barry.
- Morning, Lance.

358
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:32,273
What's with all this pudding?

359
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:36,401
That's part of a pretty amazing
airline promotional giveaway.

360
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:40,780
I'm gonna collect puddings
and coupons that can be redeemed...

361
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:42,699
...for frequent flyer miles.

362
00:31:42,824 --> 00:31:45,076
- You going on a trip?
- No, I'm not...

363
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:47,996
...but airline mileage is like
a currency these days.

364
00:31:48,162 --> 00:31:50,414
- You should go on a trip.
- No, thank you.

365
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:52,458
What do you want me to do with it?

366
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:55,836
Why don't we just leave it
there for now.

367
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:06,194
Thank you very much. I'm well.
My name is Barry Egan.

368
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:11,449
I have a little problem
with my MasterCard.

369
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,412
I lost it and I found it again...

370
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:20,374
...and I'm afraid
in my losting and finding, I...

371
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,542
Somebody might have
used my card--

372
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:27,630
- And what's the account number?
- I did punch that in earlier. I'm sorry.

373
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,799
I'm just nervous about this.

374
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,136
I don't know the proper
etiquette in this situation.

375
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,430
I just wanna make sure
no one spent any money.

376
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,642
- I don't have money to burn.
- There's nothing--

377
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,228
- I'm clean for now?
- Yes, everything is fine.

378
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:46,356
- I'm sorry I sound panicked.
- That's okay--

379
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:48,025
- What's your name?
- Jeanette.

380
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:49,192
Nice to meet you.

381
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,945
- Okay, so I'll cut it up.
- That's fine.

382
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:56,241
I'll cut up my card,
then get a new one going, right?

383
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:57,742
- Yes, you will.
- Thanks.

384
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:58,910
You're welcome.

385
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:19,679
Why's that there?
I don't want to be a dick...

386
00:34:19,846 --> 00:34:23,099
...but that could hurt somebody.
It already hurt me.

387
00:34:23,266 --> 00:34:25,476
Let's please move that.

388
00:34:31,482 --> 00:34:34,777
He's wearing that damn suit again.
I don't know why.

389
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:38,197
- He doesn't usually dress like that.
- That's fine.

390
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:44,202
Hey, why are you wearing
that suit again?

391
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:45,662
- I don't know.
- Hi.

392
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:46,830
- Hi.
- Remember me?

393
00:34:47,038 --> 00:34:48,748
- I left my car yesterday.
- Yes.

394
00:34:48,915 --> 00:34:52,502
This is Lena from work.
We're here to pick up her car.

395
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,047
We're getting breakfast.
So do you wanna go eat?

396
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:57,756
Yeah, I can't.

397
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,301
- Why?
- I have to stay here.

398
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:03,095
- Seriously, we're going to eat.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:35:03,262 --> 00:35:05,305
- That's all right.
- What is that?

400
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:08,892
- Are you learning to play the piano?
- That's not a piano.

401
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:12,187
Lance! Remember we have
to call that guy in Toledo.

402
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:14,397
- Which guy?
- I'll tell you later.

403
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:18,818
- You don't want to eat with us?
- Telephone, Barry, on line two.

404
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:21,153
What's all that pudding?

405
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:24,490
I don't know.
I'll talk to you in a second.

406
00:35:24,698 --> 00:35:27,534
- Let me get this.
- What's that pudding, Barry?

407
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:28,702
This is Barry.

408
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,288
Hey, baby. I guess
we got disconnected.

409
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:35,375
We got disconnect-- How did
you get this number for my work?

410
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:40,046
You canceled your credit card.
I need you not to and up your limit.

411
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:43,091
Okay, this is making
me very uncomfortable.

412
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:48,220
I need help. Maybe I should just
call back and talk to your girlfriend.

413
00:35:48,471 --> 00:35:50,848
- I don't have one.
- You said you did.

414
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:53,517
- I know, but I don't.
- You lied to me?

415
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,894
This is illegal, okay? I'm sorry.

416
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:58,730
- I'll call the police.
- No, you won't.

417
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:01,566
This is embarrassing.
Sorry.

418
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:04,235
- I'll go pay for my car.
- Are you sure?

419
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:05,445
He's being weird.

420
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,365
- I don't know why he's in that suit.
- It's not bad. It's okay.

421
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:12,535
He's strange. I don't know
if you'd want to date him.

422
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:17,206
- It's okay. I'll just pay for my car.
- I'm sorry.

423
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:27,674
- Come on, rich boy.
- This isn't cool.

424
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:29,884
- It was last night.
- I'm hanging up.

425
00:36:30,093 --> 00:36:32,762
- You don't know what could happen.
- I have to go.

426
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:33,888
This is a big mis--

427
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:37,558
- She's cool, right?
- Why did you just come by like this?

428
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:41,187
- It's not cool?
- No, it's fine. I feel put on the spot.

429
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:44,940
- Think you'll ask her out?
- I don't do things like that.

430
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:49,111
- Why are you being scared?
- I'm not being scared.

431
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:53,365
- You'll rag on me if I do this.
- Why would I do this to rag you?

432
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:55,825
- I don't know.
- Can I ask you a question?

433
00:36:56,076 --> 00:36:58,411
Did you ask Walter
to get you a shrink?

434
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:03,166
Did you ask Walter
to get you a shrink?

435
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:06,419
What's the matter with you?
Are you okay?

436
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:08,921
He is lying.

437
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:12,883
You're being weird again.
Please don't be weird.

438
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,551
We should be going.

439
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:19,097
Yep. Nope. I have
to get something from my car.

440
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:21,766
What guy in Toledo
are you talking about?

441
00:37:21,975 --> 00:37:23,810
I'm talking about the guy.

442
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:27,897
- I'll come over and tell you.
- Is this about the Ramada Inn?

443
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:31,067
I'll just come over
to you in a second.

444
00:37:36,864 --> 00:37:40,200
I'm sorry I couldn't come
to your sister's party.

445
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:41,702
I couldn't make it.

446
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:45,080
Not a problem. Don't worry.
We had a terrific time.

447
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:47,582
Must be weird
to have so many sisters.

448
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:51,085
- Not at all. It's nice.
- Telephone, Barry, line one.

449
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:53,254
Pardon.

450
00:37:53,963 --> 00:37:56,924
- This is Barry.
- Hang up and there'll be trouble.

451
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:59,427
- Thank you.
- What do you mean, thank--?

452
00:37:59,593 --> 00:38:02,304
- Business is good. You're busy.
- Not really.

453
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:04,932
- I saw a picture of you.
- Oh, yes?

454
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,477
Elizabeth has a picture
of your sisters and you.

455
00:38:08,602 --> 00:38:10,604
It's a lot of family. Must be nice.

456
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:14,315
- Do you have brothers or sisters?
- No. I'm the opposite.

457
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,152
That must be nice.
That must be really...

458
00:38:18,277 --> 00:38:20,988
No, it's terrible.

459
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:25,326
- What's the pudding for?
- That's something else.

460
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:29,997
- You going to get pancakes?
- Yes, we are. We're going to--

461
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:31,915
- God!
- Where you guys going?

462
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,209
How long have you
worked for my sister?

463
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:36,336
- Six months.
- So you know her.

464
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:39,464
- Do you wanna check that?
- Sure.

465
00:38:39,798 --> 00:38:42,258
Are you guys hurt?
They're okay.

466
00:38:42,425 --> 00:38:45,678
So, what do you do?
You do what she does? Same job?

467
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:50,141
I do, but I do mainly field
consultations, which is cool...

468
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:53,727
...'cause I get to travel.
I'm going to Hawaii on Friday.

469
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,063
Hawaii?
I was thinking about going there.

470
00:38:56,146 --> 00:38:56,730
Really?

471
00:38:56,939 --> 00:38:58,899
Going on business.

472
00:38:59,107 --> 00:39:02,444
- If you're going--
- I probably won't, though.

473
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:05,488
That's too bad,
because it's so great there...

474
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:08,783
...and if you were there,
we could say hello.

475
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,245
Yes, but I'm not sure.
I have so much going on here.

476
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:16,749
It depends on this thing. If it happens,
I won't be able to go.

477
00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:20,794
I can't find that thing in my car.
I can give it to you later.

478
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:24,798
- So are you gonna come eat with us?
- Yeah, I can't.

479
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:27,884
Oh, my God!

480
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:30,470
It was great to meet you again.

481
00:39:30,595 --> 00:39:33,723
- Thanks for helping.
- What's that piano? This pudding?

482
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,100
- I don't know.
- Why are they here?

483
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:41,063
Call me later about the shrink. And
Walter said you have a crying problem?

484
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:43,107
Call me later.

485
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:49,738
He's obviously very busy. I don't even
know if he has time for a girlfriend.

486
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:51,281
Sorry.

487
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:54,951
- So I'll just see you at the restaurant?
- Okay.

488
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:26,272
I'm gonna go and eat tomorrow night.
Do you want to go with me?

489
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,191
Sure.

490
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:31,777
- Do you want to pick me up?
- Sure.

491
00:40:31,986 --> 00:40:34,405
Can I write down my address
and phone number?

492
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:36,615
Sure.

493
00:40:41,954 --> 00:40:44,664
- This is funny.
- Yeah.

494
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:48,335
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

495
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:53,798
I didn't ask for a shrink.
That was somebody else.

496
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:55,883
Also, that pudding isn't mine.

497
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,428
I'm wearing a suit because
I had an important meeting.

498
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:03,140
- And I don't have a crying problem.
- Okay.

499
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:12,649
- Hi.
- Hi.

500
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:30,291
- This is Barry.
- You made a fucking war for yourself.

501
00:41:38,924 --> 00:41:41,926
- How do you know he's rich?
- He's gonna diversify.

502
00:41:43,303 --> 00:41:45,179
- Diversify what?
- His business.

503
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:47,557
- And what is his name?
- Barry Egan.

504
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:50,184
I can take the brothers
on this mission?

505
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:54,730
- We'll do it.
- Thank you so much.

506
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:05,657
Check. Check. One, two. Test. Test.
How's that sound?

507
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,951
You can't do that. It's wrong.

508
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:10,870
Check.

509
00:42:11,037 --> 00:42:13,706
Check. Check.
One, two. Test.

510
00:42:13,915 --> 00:42:15,166
They'll go.

511
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,626
Great.

512
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:19,336
- I'm only paying two of you.
- That's cool.

513
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:23,382
When can you leave? I want you
to go right away. That's best.

514
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:28,261
I also need you to check out a car
for me there that this guy's selling.

515
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:32,766
- Your expenses are your own.
- Latisha said you'd pay.

516
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:35,643
- She was wrong.
- That's not cool.

517
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:40,398
It doesn't make sense if you
think about it in a fair, deal-like sense.

518
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:41,691
It's business.

519
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:46,153
$100, two days' work. It's more than
your family makes sitting around.

520
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:51,074
All right? Now, I'm serious now,
okay? Please. Now, just stop.

521
00:42:51,283 --> 00:42:53,910
Keys to the truck.
You got to gas that up.

522
00:42:54,077 --> 00:42:57,831
All right, save receipts on that.
His address.

523
00:42:58,873 --> 00:43:01,376
We have his business
address too, but--

524
00:43:01,543 --> 00:43:02,627
You know what?

525
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:07,256
Hit him at his house first.

526
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:11,051
See what this little bad-boy
businessman is all about.

527
00:43:11,218 --> 00:43:13,470
Just fix it, sir.

528
00:43:13,804 --> 00:43:17,724
You know, I wanna tell you
something. I've gotta tell you.

529
00:43:17,891 --> 00:43:18,892
Oh, no.

530
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:21,561
I saw a picture
of your sisters and you...

531
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:26,691
...and I saw your picture,
and I really wanted to meet you.

532
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:34,740
I came to drop my car off
on purpose, to try and meet you.

533
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,913
- Are you lying?
- No.

534
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,874
- Oh, my...
- I thought I should tell you.

535
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:48,587
I didn't want to get too far along on
going out and be hiding something.

536
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,924
Very nice of you to say.

537
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:54,759
Terrific.

538
00:43:57,553 --> 00:43:59,972
I was listening
to DJs this morning...

539
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:05,394
...and they always have couples that
call in and talk about their problems.

540
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,604
This DJ Justice--

541
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:10,983
This morning DJ
that I really like and...

542
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,944
They were talking
about yearbook pictures...

543
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:18,031
...and how nobody's happy
with the way they look.

544
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:22,493
I love this guy because he tells it
the way it is. He's not a phony.

545
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,415
And this guy calls up, and
he's talking about his senior quote...

546
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:31,126
...and DJ Justice says,
"What was great about your quote?"

547
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,796
He says,
"I stole an ancient proverb."

548
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:39,134
And so he says, "Okay."
And he says, "Confusion say..."

549
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:43,013
And then DJ Justice says,
"Confusion or Confucius?"

550
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:47,350
And it was just so comical. DJ
Justice just cuts you down to size.

551
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:50,853
That's my favorite part of the show.
I laugh and laugh.

552
00:44:50,978 --> 00:44:52,980
Even when I'm alone.

553
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:59,319
So how's your business going?
Did you sell all that pudding?

554
00:45:01,405 --> 00:45:05,242
That pudding is not a sales item.

555
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,369
Why?

556
00:45:09,704 --> 00:45:12,207
It's not for sale.

557
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:14,375
Really?

558
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:16,878
Why is that?

559
00:45:18,212 --> 00:45:21,048
I'd rather not say, if that's okay.

560
00:45:21,173 --> 00:45:24,343
Oh, I'm sorry. What is it,
like, a secret pudding?

561
00:45:25,761 --> 00:45:30,140
Let's just keep it between
you and I, if that's possible?

562
00:45:30,307 --> 00:45:32,058
Sure, sure.

563
00:45:35,937 --> 00:45:40,733
Healthy Choice and American Airlines
got together for this promotion.

564
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:44,028
If you buy any 10
of Healthy Choice products...

565
00:45:44,237 --> 00:45:46,781
...they'll award you
500 frequent flyer miles.

566
00:45:47,031 --> 00:45:50,993
With this special coupon,
they'll up it to a thousand miles.

567
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:55,872
So I think they're trying to push their
teriyaki chicken, which is $1.79.

568
00:45:56,081 --> 00:46:00,168
But I looked in the supermarket,
and I saw that they had...

569
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:02,420
...pudding for 25 cents a cup.

570
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,048
Comes in packages of four.

571
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:07,383
But insanely...

572
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:11,554
...the bar codes
are on the individual cups.

573
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:14,723
So a quarter a cup--

574
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,975
Say you bought $2.50 worth.

575
00:46:17,184 --> 00:46:21,647
That's worth 500 miles.
With the coupon, it's 1000 miles.

576
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:25,317
It's a marketing mistake,
but I'm taking advantage of it.

577
00:46:26,234 --> 00:46:31,114
If you spent $3000, that would
get you a million frequent flyer miles.

578
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:34,367
You'd never pay for a ticket
the rest of your life.

579
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:38,954
So you bought all that pudding so
you could get frequent flyer miles?

580
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,498
That's insane.

581
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,542
I'm guessing it was a mistake.

582
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:48,338
But I'm taking advantage
of it while it's offered.

583
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:53,802
Who knows how long it'll last
if too many people start doing it.

584
00:46:54,886 --> 00:46:59,057
Your sister was telling me
a very funny story about you...

585
00:46:59,223 --> 00:47:04,854
...when you guys were kids.
You were building a ramp for the dog...

586
00:47:05,062 --> 00:47:09,608
...and you threw a hammer straight
through a sliding glass door.

587
00:47:09,775 --> 00:47:11,443
Is that right?

588
00:47:14,112 --> 00:47:17,657
Threw a hammer?
I don't remember doing that.

589
00:47:19,451 --> 00:47:22,245
My sister's a liar.

590
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:26,249
I have to go to the bathroom.

591
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,642
Okay. Sorry.

592
00:47:47,977 --> 00:47:49,562
The waiter come by yet?

593
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:50,938
- Hello.
- Hi.

594
00:47:51,147 --> 00:47:52,732
Can I talk to you, sir?

595
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:54,233
Why?

596
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,111
- I need you for a second, please.
- Okay.

597
00:48:00,823 --> 00:48:03,659
- Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.
- Yeah.

598
00:48:03,825 --> 00:48:05,994
- Did you do it?
- No.

599
00:48:06,244 --> 00:48:08,914
- You didn't smash up the bathroom?
- No.

600
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,041
Well, who did?

601
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,043
I don't know.

602
00:48:14,252 --> 00:48:17,255
- Sir, your hand is bleeding.
- I cut myself.

603
00:48:17,505 --> 00:48:19,966
- How?
- On my knife.

604
00:48:22,051 --> 00:48:23,928
What? What?

605
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:26,513
- Sir, your hand is bleeding.
- I know.

606
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:29,391
- You have to leave.
- I didn't do anything.

607
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:31,727
I can't prove you smashed
the bathroom--

608
00:48:31,935 --> 00:48:33,937
I didn't do that. I didn't.

609
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:36,189
- I have to ask you to go.
- Okay.

610
00:48:36,356 --> 00:48:38,358
- I didn't do it.
- You have to leave.

611
00:48:38,566 --> 00:48:41,277
- Don't do this.
- Sir, I will call the police.

612
00:48:41,444 --> 00:48:43,446
All right. Can I just stay?

613
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,867
Sir, I'm gonna crack your
fucking head open. Get out of here.

614
00:48:49,702 --> 00:48:50,661
We should go.

615
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,955
- I don't like it here, okay?
- Okay.

616
00:48:53,122 --> 00:48:54,957
Thanks.

617
00:48:59,044 --> 00:49:00,837
Thank you.

618
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:03,312
Okay.

619
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:06,399
Hey, you hit it.
You can stop laughing.

620
00:50:06,565 --> 00:50:11,236
So you know that...

621
00:50:11,403 --> 00:50:14,907
...the harmonium that's ended
up in your office?

622
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:21,621
A harmonium?

623
00:50:23,248 --> 00:50:24,290
The piano.

624
00:50:28,419 --> 00:50:31,005
Did you steal that from the street?

625
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:34,008
What's this?

626
00:50:36,176 --> 00:50:38,303
You did, didn't you?

627
00:50:41,974 --> 00:50:44,309
Yeah, I did. Why, is it yours?

628
00:50:44,518 --> 00:50:46,770
No, it's yours.

629
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:56,070
You learning to play it?

630
00:50:58,406 --> 00:51:01,659
I wouldn't put on any concerts yet.

631
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:02,868
I'm trying.

632
00:51:03,077 --> 00:51:05,829
Great. So I'm sorry,
I don't mean to pry...

633
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:09,749
...about the pudding and
the harmonium and everything...

634
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:13,294
- Not at all.
- You must travel quite a lot.

635
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:17,131
Oh, no, no, no. I don't travel.

636
00:51:20,218 --> 00:51:21,219
No?

637
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:25,181
You want to take a left up here.

638
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:27,891
Okay, I'm gonna go.

639
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,354
Good to see you again. Good to see
your face again and go out with you.

640
00:51:32,563 --> 00:51:36,650
I'll be back in town in a few days.
But if you come to Hawaii...

641
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,694
- I don't know. We'll see.
- You don't think you'll go?

642
00:51:39,944 --> 00:51:43,698
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Okay.

643
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:47,660
Have a good trip.

644
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:50,246
And bye-bye.

645
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:59,421
And bye-bye.

646
00:52:00,255 --> 00:52:03,049
And bye-bye. You fucking...

647
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:06,428
And bye-bye.
You stupid motherfucker.

648
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:16,228
Are you Barry?

649
00:52:18,606 --> 00:52:21,984
- Yes.
- This is for you.

650
00:52:25,821 --> 00:52:27,906
Okay.

651
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:37,957
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

652
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:43,462
This is Barry.

653
00:52:43,587 --> 00:52:45,839
It's me. It's Lena.

654
00:52:46,757 --> 00:52:48,675
Hi.

655
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:51,511
I just wanted you to know...

656
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,348
...wherever you're going
or whatever you're doing right now...

657
00:52:55,557 --> 00:52:59,144
...I want you to know that
I wanted to kiss you just then.

658
00:52:59,894 --> 00:53:01,854
Really?

659
00:53:02,605 --> 00:53:04,690
Yeah.

660
00:54:13,296 --> 00:54:16,257
- That was good.
- Yeah.

661
00:54:16,424 --> 00:54:20,636
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

662
00:54:22,805 --> 00:54:26,100
I don't freak out very often.

663
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:27,893
What do you mean?

664
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,063
No matter what my sister says, okay?

665
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,275
- I don't know what you mean.
- I don't freak out.

666
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:37,152
Okay.

667
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,364
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

668
00:55:48,093 --> 00:55:53,432
So I got $500. That's maximum.
That's what I can take out in a day.

669
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,142
Okay.

670
00:55:55,308 --> 00:55:57,852
This is what you get
when you're a pervert.

671
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:02,023
Said you'd help and you didn't,
so we'll take this money to her...

672
00:56:02,232 --> 00:56:04,067
...and that's that.

673
00:56:04,275 --> 00:56:08,029
Okay, but before you guys go,
I want to bring up one thing:

674
00:56:08,195 --> 00:56:09,530
I said no to Georgia.

675
00:56:09,697 --> 00:56:14,243
She wanted the money, and I had
to decline. I don't have that much.

676
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,496
That money I gave you
is a lot of money to me.

677
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:18,830
Ninety-nine cents.

678
00:56:18,997 --> 00:56:23,251
So I don't know if this is fair.
Wait, whoa. No. No, plea--

679
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:33,803
Want to fuck with what my brothers are
saying? Fuck with my family? Fuck!

680
00:56:58,326 --> 00:57:00,786
Help me!

681
00:57:02,246 --> 00:57:04,165
Help me.

682
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:33,484
Where the fuck are you going?
We know where you live.

683
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,871
Good morning.

684
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,874
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

685
00:57:50,082 --> 00:57:52,084
Come on in here.

686
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:55,463
Let's shut--

687
00:58:01,385 --> 00:58:04,596
- I got in trouble last night.
- What happened?

688
00:58:04,763 --> 00:58:06,890
I made a phone call.

689
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:09,976
Come here. Come here.

690
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:12,687
Barry, come here.

691
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:26,867
I better get more pudding.

692
00:58:27,034 --> 00:58:31,204
Barry, telephone on line one.
Barry, telephone on line one.

693
00:58:31,371 --> 00:58:33,164
- This is Barry.
- It's Rhonda.

694
00:58:33,373 --> 00:58:36,459
I need to talk to you about
smashing the windows--

695
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:40,129
- I'm going out of town for two days.
- Where you going?

696
00:58:40,338 --> 00:58:43,507
- Hawaii. But you can't tell my sisters.
- Hawaii?

697
00:58:43,674 --> 00:58:47,845
- That is so wonderful.
- Just don't tell my sisters.

698
00:58:48,053 --> 00:58:51,473
I have to get more pudding
for this trip to Hawaii.

699
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,643
I realize it sounds strange,
but it's not.

700
00:58:54,851 --> 00:58:58,230
- So would you like to come with me?
- Right now?

701
00:58:58,396 --> 00:59:00,273
Yes.

702
00:59:00,523 --> 00:59:05,111
I saw the teriyaki chicken for $1.79,
then the soup was a real deal.

703
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:10,116
But to stumble across the pudding,
it's tremendous how people don't look.

704
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:14,328
They don't look at the fine print.
Oh, my.

705
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:16,121
Okay!

706
00:59:26,589 --> 00:59:30,677
You can go to places in the world
with pudding. That is funny.

707
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:32,804
That's funny.

708
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:40,144
Yes!

709
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,278
It's gonna work.

710
00:59:50,445 --> 00:59:55,158
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
Lena, I'm coming.

711
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:58,286
- I'm gonna get on line.
- Lena. Aloha.

712
00:59:58,453 --> 01:00:01,539
- Barry, I'll be on line.
- Okay. I'm coming.

713
01:00:01,706 --> 01:00:03,291
Okay.

714
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:08,754
What do you mean? It doesn't say
six to eight weeks anywhere.

715
01:00:08,921 --> 01:00:12,299
It takes that long to process
and validate the order.

716
01:00:12,466 --> 01:00:14,718
I had this planned in my mind, okay?

717
01:00:14,926 --> 01:00:18,555
I could get the pudding to you today.
I'm leaving today.

718
01:00:18,763 --> 01:00:21,683
I've explained this.
It takes time to process.

719
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:25,603
How am I supposed to know this
if you don't tell me this?

720
01:00:25,812 --> 01:00:29,523
If it's not in the fine print.
That's an impossibility.

721
01:00:29,732 --> 01:00:33,569
- It takes time to process.
- I didn't see a six or an eight.

722
01:00:33,736 --> 01:00:39,283
- This is bullcrap to me.
- That's how long it takes to process.

723
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:41,368
Hello?

724
01:00:41,743 --> 01:00:43,578
Hello?

725
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,499
Hello?

726
01:01:07,225 --> 01:01:09,060
All right!

727
01:01:10,478 --> 01:01:14,857
The pudding takes six to eight weeks
to process, so that won't work.

728
01:01:15,024 --> 01:01:20,112
I'll take a bath on that today.
But here's what I'm gonna tell you.

729
01:01:20,321 --> 01:01:24,033
- Now, the pudding...
- Yeah?

730
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:27,703
- You okay?
- The chair broke.

731
01:01:27,828 --> 01:01:31,373
We'll get to the pudding later.
I'm gonna go now.

732
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:33,500
I'll call you from there.

733
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:36,628
- You run the place till I'm back.
- No doubt.

734
01:01:36,753 --> 01:01:40,632
- Don't tell my sisters anything, okay?
- Absolutely.

735
01:01:55,437 --> 01:01:57,314
- Good afternoon.
- Thank you.

736
01:01:57,522 --> 01:02:00,984
- Have a great flight.
- Thanks very much.

737
01:02:27,175 --> 01:02:30,512
I've never been on a plane before.

738
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:36,309
- What was that sound?
- I don't know.

739
01:03:06,462 --> 01:03:08,631
- Hi.
- Hi. Where you wanna go?

740
01:03:08,797 --> 01:03:12,801
Could you take me to where
the beach is and the hotels are?

741
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,679
And I'm gonna need a phone.

742
01:03:22,811 --> 01:03:23,812
Hello?

743
01:03:23,978 --> 01:03:25,730
- It's me.
- What are you doing?

744
01:03:25,897 --> 01:03:29,775
Nothing, I'm at work. I was wondering
about your friend Lena.

745
01:03:29,901 --> 01:03:31,319
Yeah, what about her?

746
01:03:31,485 --> 01:03:35,155
I was wondering if you know
where she's staying in Hawaii.

747
01:03:35,364 --> 01:03:37,324
She left her pocketbook here.

748
01:03:37,491 --> 01:03:40,661
I wanna get it to her,
make sure she's not nervous.

749
01:03:40,827 --> 01:03:44,206
I know exactly where she's staying,
and you're lying.

750
01:03:44,414 --> 01:03:47,876
She didn't forget her purse.
Why do you want her number?

751
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:50,336
- Don't do this.
- Why do you want it?

752
01:03:50,503 --> 01:03:52,714
- All I want is her number.
- Why?

753
01:03:52,964 --> 01:03:55,550
- Don't treat me this way.
- Do you like her?

754
01:03:55,716 --> 01:03:58,844
- You're killing me.
- Oh, my God. Calm down.

755
01:03:59,053 --> 01:04:01,555
All I want is her fucking number!

756
01:04:01,722 --> 01:04:06,059
Give me that fucking number.
You hear me? I'm sick of this shit!

757
01:04:06,184 --> 01:04:10,814
Stop fucking treating me this way.
I'll fucking kill you. You want that?

758
01:04:12,107 --> 01:04:16,110
- Aloha, Sheraton Waikiki.
- Hi, yes. Lena Leonard's room.

759
01:04:16,277 --> 01:04:19,405
- Okay, one moment.
- Thank you.

760
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:24,827
Hello?

761
01:04:25,035 --> 01:04:26,620
Hello?

762
01:04:28,622 --> 01:04:32,542
- Is Lena there?
- You have the wrong room.

763
01:04:36,296 --> 01:04:38,423
Aloha, Sheraton Waikiki.

764
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:42,594
Hi. I just called. I think I was
connected to the wrong room.

765
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,557
I'm looking for a Lena Leonard.
There shouldn't be a man in that room.

766
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:51,560
One moment, please.

767
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:54,480
Thank you.

768
01:04:58,275 --> 01:05:00,152
Hello?

769
01:05:00,652 --> 01:05:02,821
- Lena!
- Yeah?

770
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:05,198
Hi, this is Barry Egan.

771
01:05:05,365 --> 01:05:09,327
Oh, wow, yeah?! That's great!
You came, you came!

772
01:05:09,494 --> 01:05:12,079
- What are you doing?
- I didn't hear you!

773
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:14,624
I just want to know
what you're doing?

774
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:18,544
- Where are you?
- I'm calling you. I'm in my hotel room!

775
01:05:18,752 --> 01:05:21,672
Yeah, I'm just down here
on my business trip!

776
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:25,092
Let's do something, then.
You want to do something?

777
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:28,678
Yeah! You don't have a boyfriend
or anything, do you?

778
01:05:28,845 --> 01:05:31,973
- No! What do you mean?
- I just wanted to know.

779
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:36,311
- When's the last time you had one?
- About six months ago. Why?

780
01:05:36,477 --> 01:05:40,564
- I just wanted to make sure.
- When did you last have a girlfriend?

781
01:05:40,731 --> 01:05:42,942
- Were you ever married?
- Yeah.

782
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:46,487
Okay. How long were you married for?

783
01:05:46,612 --> 01:05:49,323
Do you want to meet
and talk about this?

784
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:52,868
Okay. Where are you from originally?

785
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:05,728
I'm here.

786
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:56,775
You got me out of my hotel room.

787
01:07:57,484 --> 01:08:00,487
You came and got me out of my room.

788
01:08:02,364 --> 01:08:04,324
It's so nice.

789
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:16,127
It really looks like Hawaii here.

790
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:54,510
I'm sorry. I forgot to shave.

791
01:09:54,969 --> 01:09:57,805
Your face is so adorable...

792
01:09:57,972 --> 01:10:00,641
...and your skin and your cheek.

793
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:03,144
I want to bite it.

794
01:10:03,394 --> 01:10:08,649
I want to bite your cheek
and chew on it. It's so fucking cute.

795
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:15,280
I'm looking at your face
and I just want to smash it.

796
01:10:15,447 --> 01:10:18,908
I just want to fucking smash it
with a sledgehammer...

797
01:10:19,075 --> 01:10:21,536
...and squeeze it. You're so pretty.

798
01:10:21,703 --> 01:10:25,957
I want to chew your face,
and I want to scoop out your eyes...

799
01:10:26,165 --> 01:10:30,878
...and I want to eat them.
Chew them and suck on them.

800
01:10:32,171 --> 01:10:34,173
Okay.

801
01:10:34,673 --> 01:10:38,051
- This is funny.
- Yeah.

802
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,554
This is nice.

803
01:10:52,315 --> 01:10:57,987
At that restaurant, I beat up
the bathroom. I'm sorry.

804
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:10,915
- Hi.
- Hi.

805
01:11:11,082 --> 01:11:15,920
They need to see the new 4-84s
to make sure it works with their OC.

806
01:11:16,087 --> 01:11:21,008
- Okay. What should I do about Eric?
- Just tell him to call me.

807
01:11:21,175 --> 01:11:25,054
- Okay. So did my brother call you?
- No.

808
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:29,141
I don't know what he's doing.
I'm sorry that didn't work out.

809
01:11:29,349 --> 01:11:32,060
- It's fine.
- You don't wanna date him anyway.

810
01:11:32,227 --> 01:11:37,148
- Honestly, he's a freak sometimes.
- Yeah, he did seem a little strange.

811
01:11:37,273 --> 01:11:41,778
Well, he's not that strange.
Don't say that.

812
01:11:42,778 --> 01:11:47,658
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- I think he's weird, but that's me.

813
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:54,289
- Okay. So should I call you later?
- That's okay.

814
01:11:54,498 --> 01:11:58,335
I'll just see you when you get back.
Okay, bye.

815
01:12:06,259 --> 01:12:10,346
- So where do you have to go?
- For what?

816
01:12:10,805 --> 01:12:12,807
For work.

817
01:12:14,308 --> 01:12:18,687
I don't have any business here.
I came here for you.

818
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:44,420
- Hello there, guy.
- Hi, look. This is Bar--

819
01:12:44,586 --> 01:12:48,048
You have almost reached me,
but not quite.

820
01:12:48,256 --> 01:12:52,844
I'm shaving my roommate's pussy
right now, so I'm a bit distracted.

821
01:12:53,053 --> 01:12:57,223
Leave your name and home phone
number, area code first, please.

822
01:12:57,348 --> 01:13:01,394
I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
God, she's so sexy.

823
01:13:01,561 --> 01:13:02,603
Bye, honey.

824
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:07,191
This is Barry Egan. I'm calling
about what took place the other night.

825
01:13:07,358 --> 01:13:11,320
I wanted to tell everybody
it was not fair what you did to me.

826
01:13:11,528 --> 01:13:15,449
I am expecting my money back.
I realize you have my number.

827
01:13:15,615 --> 01:13:20,161
I'm on vacation now. If you want
to reach me, shortly I will be home...

828
01:13:20,328 --> 01:13:23,456
...and we can discuss
how you can return my money.

829
01:13:23,623 --> 01:13:27,543
Otherwise, I'm pretty sure
that the police can be contacted...

830
01:13:27,668 --> 01:13:31,380
...and I could do that,
and I feel like it's warranted.

831
01:13:31,505 --> 01:13:35,092
So let's figure something out.

832
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:40,639
Like I said, I'll be home shortly.
Give me a call. Okay, thank you.

833
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:01,200
How many airplanes
have you been on?

834
01:14:02,284 --> 01:14:05,537
I think, maybe over a hundred.

835
01:14:05,829 --> 01:14:10,417
- That's right, you travel a lot.
- Yeah.

836
01:14:14,295 --> 01:14:18,174
How much do you travel?
Do you travel all the time?

837
01:14:20,426 --> 01:14:22,803
Forgot about that.

838
01:14:25,264 --> 01:14:28,392
Can I come home with you
when we get there?

839
01:14:28,684 --> 01:14:30,477
Of course.

840
01:14:30,644 --> 01:14:32,646
Is it okay to ask that?

841
01:14:36,232 --> 01:14:39,402
I thought that you were anyways.

842
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,483
Come here.

843
01:15:41,877 --> 01:15:42,920
Are you okay?

844
01:15:43,087 --> 01:15:46,048
- Yes, I'm fine. Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

845
01:15:46,173 --> 01:15:50,260
- What is this?
- It's okay. It's okay.

846
01:15:51,178 --> 01:15:54,472
Follow the penlight
with your eyes, okay?

847
01:15:55,515 --> 01:15:59,310
People are just crazy
in this world, I think.

848
01:16:51,109 --> 01:16:55,404
- Hi. Janice the operator. Who's this?
- This is Barry Egan.

849
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:59,408
- We talked. Do you remember?
- No, sweetie, I don't remember.

850
01:16:59,575 --> 01:17:03,162
Cut the crap, lady!
You said your name was Georgia.

851
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:06,957
You said our conversation
was confidential! I trusted you.

852
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:11,586
And then you called me
and asked for money! Am I right?!

853
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:13,004
- Am I right?!
- Sir--

854
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:15,256
Get your supervisor on the phone!

855
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:19,135
I want whoever owns that place
on the phone! You hear me?!

856
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:23,681
- Can you wait a second, please?
- No more bullcrap! I'm not kidding!!

857
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:35,901
- Yeah, this is Dean.
- It's me.

858
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:40,947
Barry Egan's on the other line.
He wants to talk to a supervisor.

859
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:42,699
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

860
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:44,867
- Put him through.
- This is bad--

861
01:17:45,076 --> 01:17:46,619
Will you shut up?

862
01:17:47,286 --> 01:17:50,331
Okay, sexy. I'll connect you
with my supervisor.

863
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:52,708
You're in trouble, honey.

864
01:17:53,834 --> 01:17:54,835
Who's this?

865
01:17:55,044 --> 01:17:57,838
My name's Barry Egan.
I called your service--

866
01:17:58,005 --> 01:18:00,507
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- What?

867
01:18:00,674 --> 01:18:02,884
Calm down.
What's the problem?

868
01:18:03,093 --> 01:18:06,346
The problem is, if you let
me explain, your employee...

869
01:18:06,513 --> 01:18:10,350
...that girl who I was just speaking with,
has been threatening me.

870
01:18:10,558 --> 01:18:13,519
And four blond gentlemen
just attacked me...

871
01:18:13,686 --> 01:18:16,981
...and smashed my car
and hurt my girl.

872
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:22,402
Go fuck yourself. That has nothing to
do with me. I run a legitimate business.

873
01:18:22,528 --> 01:18:23,779
Listen to me.

874
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:28,366
- What's your name, sir?! Answer me!
- What's your name, asshole?!

875
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:29,826
I'm Barry Egan!

876
01:18:30,076 --> 01:18:32,620
How do I know?!
You could be anybody!

877
01:18:32,787 --> 01:18:37,750
You have no right taking people's
confidence in your service!

878
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:41,671
- You're sick!
- No, shut up! Shut the fuck up!

879
01:18:41,837 --> 01:18:44,757
You have no right
to take people's trust.

880
01:18:44,882 --> 01:18:49,303
Shut up! Shut! Shut!
Shut! Shut! Shut up!

881
01:18:49,595 --> 01:18:51,013
Shut up!

882
01:18:51,805 --> 01:18:54,683
Now! Are you threatening me, dick?!

883
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:56,142
Why don't you--?

884
01:18:56,309 --> 01:18:58,395
You go fuck yourself!

885
01:19:03,274 --> 01:19:06,777
You-- Fuck! Did you just say,
"Go fuck myself"?

886
01:19:10,156 --> 01:19:11,365
Yes, I did.

887
01:19:11,991 --> 01:19:15,244
That wasn't good!
You're dead!

888
01:19:17,663 --> 01:19:18,830
Is there--?

889
01:19:18,997 --> 01:19:23,752
Is that guy in the blue suit, is he
just around the corner? Can you...?

890
01:19:23,918 --> 01:19:26,504
Yes, there's a police officer here.

891
01:19:26,713 --> 01:19:29,340
No, the guy who came with me.
Is he there?

892
01:19:29,507 --> 01:19:33,010
I'm not sure. We can ask
the receptionist to get him.

893
01:19:33,219 --> 01:19:35,387
He's probably in the waiting room.

894
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:08,919
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

895
01:20:09,086 --> 01:20:13,215
There was a blond woman in there.
Did they move her room?

896
01:20:13,423 --> 01:20:16,676
- What's her name, sir?
- Lena Leonard.

897
01:20:16,801 --> 01:20:19,262
- Are you a relative?
- Yes.

898
01:20:19,429 --> 01:20:23,474
- Just a minute. Let me check for you.
- Okay.

899
01:20:24,809 --> 01:20:29,438
- She was discharged this evening.
- She was discharged, okay.

900
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:46,871
Welcome to Directory Assistance.
City and state, please.

901
01:20:47,038 --> 01:20:49,540
Somewhere in Utah.

902
01:20:49,832 --> 01:20:51,667
Thank you.

903
01:20:55,212 --> 01:20:56,797
What listing?

904
01:20:56,964 --> 01:21:01,009
Can I have the listing
for D&D Mattress Man?

905
01:22:06,028 --> 01:22:08,281
- Fuck you.
- No.

906
01:22:08,489 --> 01:22:10,616
You're a pervert.

907
01:22:11,325 --> 01:22:14,745
Think you can be a pervert
and not pay for it?

908
01:22:15,412 --> 01:22:16,997
Don't you say that to me.

909
01:22:17,331 --> 01:22:20,459
- You called the phone-sex--
- Shut up.

910
01:22:22,627 --> 01:22:24,421
I didn't do anything.

911
01:22:25,213 --> 01:22:29,634
I'm a nice man.
I mind my own business.

912
01:22:29,842 --> 01:22:35,765
So you tell me that's that
before I beat the hell from you.

913
01:22:37,641 --> 01:22:41,729
I have so much strength in me.
You have no idea.

914
01:22:44,648 --> 01:22:47,400
I have a love in my life.

915
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:52,238
It makes me stronger
than anything you can imagine.

916
01:22:52,822 --> 01:22:56,617
I would say that's that, Mattress Man.

917
01:23:06,168 --> 01:23:09,630
You came all the way
from L.A. to tell me this?

918
01:23:09,796 --> 01:23:11,548
Yes, I did.

919
01:23:16,177 --> 01:23:18,263
Tell the cops?

920
01:23:19,681 --> 01:23:21,349
No.

921
01:23:25,228 --> 01:23:27,021
All right.

922
01:23:28,522 --> 01:23:30,482
That's that.

923
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:46,497
- Now, get the fuck out of here, pervert!
- Didn't I warn you?!

924
01:23:46,623 --> 01:23:48,541
That's that.

925
01:24:02,846 --> 01:24:06,600
- Barry, you okay? What's going on?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

926
01:24:06,766 --> 01:24:07,809
Where you been?

927
01:24:08,018 --> 01:24:12,981
I was in Utah, but now I'm here
and I'll be right back.

928
01:24:13,273 --> 01:24:15,024
Barry?

929
01:24:18,736 --> 01:24:20,780
Where you going?

930
01:24:50,224 --> 01:24:52,059
Lena.

931
01:24:52,392 --> 01:24:54,603
I'm so sorry.

932
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:59,149
I'm so sorry I left you
at the hospital.

933
01:24:59,858 --> 01:25:02,819
I called a phone-sex line--

934
01:25:02,986 --> 01:25:06,864
I called a phone-sex line
before I met you...

935
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:11,035
...and four blond brothers
came after me...

936
01:25:11,243 --> 01:25:14,413
...and they hurt you, and I'm sorry.

937
01:25:14,538 --> 01:25:18,333
Then I had to leave again
because I wanted to make sure...

938
01:25:18,459 --> 01:25:21,044
...you never got hurt again.

939
01:25:21,712 --> 01:25:24,548
And I have a lot of pudding...

940
01:25:24,714 --> 01:25:28,968
...and in six to eight weeks,
it can be redeemed.

941
01:25:29,177 --> 01:25:32,972
So if you could just give me
that much time...

942
01:25:33,139 --> 01:25:37,685
...I think I can get enough mileage
to go with you wherever you go...

943
01:25:37,852 --> 01:25:40,354
...if you have to travel
for your work.

944
01:25:40,521 --> 01:25:44,191
Because I don't ever want
to be anywhere without you.

945
01:25:44,358 --> 01:25:48,737
So could you just let me
redeem the mileage?

946
01:25:48,904 --> 01:25:53,033
- You left me at the hospital.
- I'm sorry.

947
01:25:53,491 --> 01:25:55,702
You can't do that.

948
01:25:56,744 --> 01:25:59,705
If you just give me
six to eight weeks...

949
01:25:59,872 --> 01:26:01,832
...I can redeem the mileage...

950
01:26:01,999 --> 01:26:05,795
...and I can go with you
wherever you have to travel.

951
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:08,770
So here we go.
