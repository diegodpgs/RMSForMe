1
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:44,512
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

2
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:49,283
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

3
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:52,660
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase.</i>

4
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:56,866
<i>Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses,
they'll know.</i>

5
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:04,542
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

6
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,280
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

7
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:11,839
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

8
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,941
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There it is!</i>

9
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:16,418
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

10
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:19,022
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

11
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:24,285
<i>I had heard it at least 14 times that night.</i>

12
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:26,522
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,701
<i>First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

14
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,033
<i>There were certain institutions and people
that frowned upon it,</i>

15
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,300
<i>but it's legal.</i>

16
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,171
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

17
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:40,437
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

18
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:42,578
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

19
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:45,710
<i>That's what got me into all this mess.</i>

20
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:51,313
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over $640,000.</i>

21
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:56,183
<i>All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.</i>

22
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:59,025
<i>- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.</i>

23
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:01,100
<i>Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.</i>

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,191
<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

25
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:05,463
<i>Folded arms, the table's hot.</i>

26
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:09,031
<i>A touch to the eye, we need to talk.</i>

27
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:14,906
<i>And a hand running through
perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.</i>

28
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,242
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,586
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

30
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:43,702
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

31
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:08,516
Premed.

32
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,048
4.0 GPA.

33
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,217
44 MCATs.

34
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:16,119
President, American Legion Math League.

35
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,596
TA to Professors Wilkins and Sanders.

36
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,965
Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.

37
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,097
And you're accepted early into school here
at Harvard Med,

38
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:28,141
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

39
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,209
Thank you.

40
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,541
The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.

41
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:36,083
It's a free ride.
And free rides don't come easy.

42
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:37,173
Absolutely.

43
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:42,383
We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship

44
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:46,086
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.

45
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,188
Right.

46
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,958
Professor Phillips?

47
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:55,168
Some kids grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

48
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:59,229
You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.

49
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:04,735
I grew up... Well, really,
I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.

50
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:11,444
And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.

51
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:14,612
Which I don't really have.

52
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:20,621
So, what I'm trying to say

53
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:25,063
is that I really, really need this scholarship.

54
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,498
Did you rehearse that?

55
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:32,972
Yeah. Like, 14 times in front of the mirror.

56
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:38,010
Unfortunately,
desire doesn't figure into this much.

57
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:43,249
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who

58
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:46,015
dazzles.

59
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,648
Somebody who just jumps off the page.

60
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:55,562
Oh, well, then, I'm also involved
in a science competition.

61
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:57,393
We're building a robotic wheel

62
00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:01,697
that can navigate itself
using a proprietary GPS system.

63
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:05,906
Well, I'm designing the system. So...

64
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,135
Right.

65
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,078
Ben, last year,
the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,

66
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,149
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.

67
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:18,347
Well, I have both my legs.

68
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:21,583
Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?

69
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:24,450
That was a joke.

70
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:27,362
Ben, it's all about the essay.

71
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:30,456
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

72
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,899
What life experience separates you
from all the rest.

73
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,495
Life experience.

74
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:39,303
What can you tell me, Ben,

75
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:42,037
that's going to dazzle me?

76
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,894
I'm so sorry I'm late.

77
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:11,269
- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.

78
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,935
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

79
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:18,445
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?

80
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,015
Eight dollars?

81
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,385
Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren.
Thank you. Thank you.

82
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:29,287
You slept with him, didn't you?

83
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,351
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

84
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:35,091
I'll sleep with him, too,
and I'll get $8 an hour.

85
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:38,326
So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?
And I say to him,

86
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:42,165
<i>" Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes</i>

87
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,365
<i>" to get the kind of results
that you're looking for," okay?</i>

88
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:48,411
<i>So then he says to me, " Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"</i>

89
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:53,609
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,

90
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:56,981
<i>" You can never have
enough capacitance probes."</i>

91
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,887
Oh, my God.
What the hell is wrong with you?

92
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,726
Oh, nothing.

93
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:09,330
I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man.
You should be happy.

94
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:14,564
I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.

95
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:19,701
And the reason that I have nothing
is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.

96
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,506
- Oh, give me a break, Ben.
- What?

97
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,342
You have everything.

98
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:29,208
You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?

99
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,582
Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.

100
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:32,952
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.

101
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,989
You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.

102
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:39,460
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

103
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:42,464
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.

104
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,534
Man, I gave up everything.

105
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:47,302
You know, I gave up fun. I gave up sex.

106
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:49,065
I don't think you gave up sex.

107
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,403
- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.

108
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,203
All right, all right. Not sex, but...

109
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,302
It just annoys me that the one thing

110
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:58,348
that is stopping me
from going to Harvard Med is money.

111
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,681
You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over $300,000.

112
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,579
$300,000.

113
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,988
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high.
I get that.

114
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:12,996
You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.

115
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,561
Well, look at the bright side,

116
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:21,231
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

117
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,643
Thank you.

118
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:37,512
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.

119
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:38,919
Thank you, love. Kisses.

120
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,252
Make a wish.

121
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:41,654
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

122
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:44,994
Bravo.

123
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:46,427
Congratulations, Benjamin.

124
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:49,329
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?

125
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:52,597
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

126
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:55,696
Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.

127
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,331
Cam, you owe another six bucks.

128
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,069
No, no. I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.

129
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:01,645
Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.

130
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:04,010
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.

131
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:07,141
I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

132
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:10,449
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

133
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:13,490
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

134
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,958
So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night,

135
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:19,429
after 19 cups of coffee.

136
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:22,558
- Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

137
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:25,827
This is good. Miles, this is good.

138
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:31,170
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.

139
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:32,607
This is called destiny.

140
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,508
You know, there is the... Thank you.

141
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:38,276
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

142
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:41,785
Oh, yeah?
Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!

143
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:44,185
Look, guys,

144
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:50,920
we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.

145
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:55,590
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

146
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:59,037
If we can't even win that, what's the point?

147
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:03,542
Hey, hey. Look at this!

148
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:05,736
No, no, no, no.

149
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:13,045
We suck.

150
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:22,656
Your father would be so proud of you, Ben.

151
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:25,455
Yeah.

152
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:29,834
Do you remember anything about him?

153
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,603
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?

154
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,840
Yeah, I think I watched him shave.

155
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,842
So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?

156
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:46,680
I don't know. I'll probably just go back
and work on that essay.

157
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,754
Ben, you're working too hard.

158
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:53,553
Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just yourself.

159
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:57,459
You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.

160
00:12:57,563 --> 00:13:01,591
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

161
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:03,931
Okay. All right.

162
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:06,899
- Good night.
- All right, good night.

163
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,873
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

164
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:15,941
All right.

165
00:13:16,048 --> 00:13:20,645
Now, who can explain Newton's method
and how you use it?

166
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:24,647
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.

167
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:29,983
That's impressive. That's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,

168
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:33,587
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

169
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:37,926
All right, now somebody tell me something
I don't already know.

170
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,164
Anyone?

171
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:41,832
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.

172
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:44,068
Newton stole it.

173
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:47,171
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

174
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:52,450
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

175
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:57,488
And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then it fails.

176
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,386
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.

177
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:02,519
Ben.

178
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:05,462
So Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

179
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:07,260
was the original author of this method.

180
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,461
Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?

181
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,800
Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.

182
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:16,271
And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson

183
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:20,938
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

184
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:24,244
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?

185
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:28,755
We're gonna call this
the game show host problem, all right?

186
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,881
Ben, suppose you're on a game show.

187
00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:34,483
And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?

188
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:39,497
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.

189
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,999
Which door would you choose, Ben?

190
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:43,460
Door number one?

191
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,368
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

192
00:14:45,473 --> 00:14:47,464
All right, now, the game show host,

193
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:50,544
who, by the way,
knows what's behind all the other doors,

194
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:54,842
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

195
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:58,849
Behind which sits a goat. Now...

196
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,750
Ben, game show host comes up to you.

197
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:03,255
<i>He says, " Ben, do you want to stay
with door number one</i>

198
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:04,688
<i>" or go with door number two?"</i>

199
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:08,250
Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?

200
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,454
- Yeah.
- Well, wait.

201
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:12,658
Remember, the host knows where the car is

202
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:15,200
so how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

203
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:18,170
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

204
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:22,504
Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.

205
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,578
Based on variable change.

206
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:28,112
Variable change?
But he just asked you a simple question.

207
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:30,479
Yeah, which changed everything.

208
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:32,116
Enlighten us.

209
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:35,485
Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,

210
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:39,048
I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right.

211
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:43,257
But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,

212
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:47,562
it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch.

213
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:53,369
So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3%.

214
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:57,104
Exactly.

215
00:15:57,211 --> 00:15:58,405
People, remember,

216
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:02,744
if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.

217
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,943
Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch

218
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:08,545
out of paranoia, fear, emotions.

219
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:11,558
But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside

220
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,489
and let simple math get his ass
into a brand-new car!

221
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:21,861
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

222
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:23,027
All right, everybody.

223
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,537
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

224
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,198
Your graded papers are down here
at the end.

225
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,833
You can pick them up on your way out.

226
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,914
I am invincible.

227
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:50,354
Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock.

228
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:06,978
Man. That's brutal.

229
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:12,084
You know,
you should just ask her out, man.

230
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,678
It's not like she's a rocket scientist
or anything.

231
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,383
Oh, wait, she is.

232
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,551
Well, why don't you ask her?

233
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:22,322
Because I'm already dating someone.

234
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,222
Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles.

235
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,632
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

236
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:34,332
Hey, you know what?
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.

237
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,842
Yeah, that's funny.

238
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:42,779
You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?

239
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:47,485
Well, I'd say getting down with that
would definitely qualify.

240
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:49,485
Cam!

241
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,179
Boy genius.

242
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:15,107
You have to follow me now.

243
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:18,179
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

244
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:20,382
Come on.

245
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:30,763
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

246
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:48,644
Our honored guest.

247
00:18:50,686 --> 00:18:52,449
- How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.

248
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:55,319
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.

249
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,424
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.

250
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:01,020
- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.

251
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,194
- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.

252
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:10,203
Is there a problem with my paper?

253
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:13,503
Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton

254
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:17,239
and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.

255
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:22,341
Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.

256
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:25,813
So, is this some kind of a math club?

257
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,752
Don't be rude, people.

258
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:31,453
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

259
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:33,154
- Choi.
- Jill.

260
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:40,097
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.

261
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:42,631
No, really? Well, it's really simple, actually.

262
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:44,832
You play against the dealer.

263
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,100
You're given two cards.

264
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:49,475
Face cards are worth 10 points.

265
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,639
The closest to 21 wins.

266
00:19:51,882 --> 00:19:55,613
If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.

267
00:19:57,054 --> 00:19:59,955
It's the most popular card game
in the world.

268
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:01,285
It's a game with memory.

269
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:04,087
Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.

270
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:06,925
And the best part, it's beatable.

271
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,394
Are you talking about counting cards?

272
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:16,097
No. I'm talking about getting very, very rich.

273
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:21,767
You count cards, right? All of you?

274
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:23,370
As a team, yes.

275
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:27,139
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

276
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,748
- Where?
- Vegas, baby.

277
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:34,549
So, why are you telling me?

278
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:38,490
Well, let's just say a spot opened up
on our roster.

279
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:39,620
How?

280
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:42,322
Jimmy got a job at Google.

281
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:45,869
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.

282
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:48,800
Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?

283
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:51,205
Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler.

284
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:54,304
Yeah... This is crazy.

285
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:57,108
No, Ben. This is profitable.

286
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,648
Yeah, I can't do it. So, I'm sorry.

287
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:06,690
- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.

288
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,349
No, it's not that. It's...

289
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:13,396
I just got a promotion at my job,
so it's kind of not a good time for me.

290
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:14,965
We pay better.

291
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,395
Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends.

292
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:22,132
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.

293
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,401
I mean, what do you have to worry about?

294
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:28,570
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

295
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:34,209
Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.

296
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,815
You know, the 2.09 Competition?

297
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:41,020
Wait, no.
I'm building a car that drives by itself.

298
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,958
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,

299
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:46,087
so it's kind of important.

300
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:50,032
Ben, let the car drive by itself.

301
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:58,231
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also composed.

302
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,968
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

303
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,251
Ben, you were born for this.

304
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,450
You'll have more fun
than you've ever had in your entire life.

305
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:11,955
It's perfect.

306
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:17,660
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.

307
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,163
So I'm sorry.

308
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,165
Ben.

309
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,908
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

310
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:33,706
- No, of...
- No.

311
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:35,973
You're one of my favorite new students,

312
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:39,312
and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.

313
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:48,223
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.

314
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:51,160
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?

315
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:53,458
So, how much is this thing gonna run me?

316
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:58,764
Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95,
minus 15%.

317
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:01,533
The jacket's $589.99.

318
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,201
The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both.

319
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,576
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99.

320
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,808
The shoes were just marked down
from $155,

321
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:17,481
so you're looking at $1,042.68.

322
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,956
I'm pretty good with numbers.

323
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:26,290
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

324
00:23:26,398 --> 00:23:28,696
Yeah, so let me know
when I can ring that up for you guys.

325
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:30,698
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

326
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:37,033
Hey.

327
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:40,836
Hey.

328
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:44,982
- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

329
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:48,117
I'm looking for a tie.

330
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:52,624
Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale
on the ties.

331
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,352
And if you want,
I could probably get you an additional 10%

332
00:23:57,464 --> 00:23:59,489
with my employee discount.

333
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:03,101
- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

334
00:24:04,637 --> 00:24:09,802
This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,

335
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:13,970
you know, to repel liquids and stains.

336
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,608
- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.

337
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:21,254
Face me. Stay still.

338
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:26,656
Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,

339
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:32,321
I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben.

340
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:36,528
I came to see you.

341
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:39,032
You did?

342
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:42,639
Blackjack's a great game.

343
00:24:42,743 --> 00:24:44,369
No, look, it's easy to learn

344
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:48,277
and there's really not as much strategy to it
as people think.

345
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:50,472
I grew up on it, actually.

346
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:54,020
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

347
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:58,354
Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.

348
00:24:58,592 --> 00:25:02,084
I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.

349
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,689
If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream.

350
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:07,663
And what if he won?

351
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:11,293
He'd still take me out for ice cream.

352
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:14,738
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, he's your dad.

353
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:20,109
Ben, you should feel the thrill

354
00:25:20,614 --> 00:25:24,311
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

355
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:32,554
I think you should come to Vegas.

356
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,063
'Cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

357
00:25:42,803 --> 00:25:43,997
I can't.

358
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,205
I'm sorry.

359
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:48,741
I just can't.

360
00:25:50,477 --> 00:25:54,311
Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.

361
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:56,175
Yeah.

362
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:58,816
You're welcome any time.

363
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:06,692
You know,
I think the best thing about Vegas

364
00:26:07,394 --> 00:26:09,862
is you can become anyone you want.

365
00:26:39,394 --> 00:26:40,588
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

366
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:41,662
- No.
- Plus 11.

367
00:26:41,763 --> 00:26:42,752
No.

368
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:45,897
<i>- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me " dude."</i>

369
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:47,400
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

370
00:26:47,502 --> 00:26:50,664
People, please. We had a total of 76 cards
that came out of the deck.

371
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:52,899
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

372
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:55,101
Seventeen were neutral with no value at all,

373
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,939
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

374
00:26:57,045 --> 00:26:59,673
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

375
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,710
The count. It's plus 13.

376
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:09,281
Yes.

377
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,050
Pull up a chair.

378
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:20,826
Stop.

379
00:27:21,603 --> 00:27:24,367
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

380
00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:26,440
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

381
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:28,835
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

382
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:30,002
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

383
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:31,079
Cat.

384
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:33,912
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

385
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:36,275
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

386
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:40,480
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

387
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:42,078
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

388
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,456
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.

389
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,264
<i>I was studying all day, every day.</i>

390
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:53,824
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

391
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:56,995
<i>used in ways I could never have imagined.</i>

392
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:00,771
<i>The team had a system.</i>

393
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:04,544
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

394
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:08,909
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

395
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:10,652
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

396
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:11,777
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

397
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:13,683
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

398
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:15,284
Plus 12.

399
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,483
Is this chemistry review?

400
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:23,889
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

401
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,125
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

402
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:26,599
Use it in a sentence.

403
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:28,966
Man, that sugar's sweet.

404
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:34,168
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

405
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:35,800
<i>That's how I knew what to bet.</i>

406
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,606
You're doing great.

407
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:43,680
Micky, I just want to let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,

408
00:28:43,786 --> 00:28:45,811
which is $300,000.

409
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:49,584
I mean, if I can get anything close to that,
then I'm done.

410
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:53,125
<i>Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not " if," it's " when."</i>

411
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,891
And second of all,
I get it. I completely understand.

412
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:58,626
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

413
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:01,999
Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,

414
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:05,471
so who knows how long this gig's
gonna last for any of us?

415
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:07,303
What if we get caught?

416
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,471
Our system keeps us under the radar,
you'll see.

417
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:13,242
Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal.

418
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:18,610
- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.

419
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:24,891
You think you can beat the system?

420
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:29,663
This is the system, beating you back.

421
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:35,564
You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.

422
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:39,970
- Get him up.
- Come on, kid.

423
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:41,633
Count to five.

424
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,441
- Count to five!
- What?

425
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:49,185
Count to five so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.

426
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:50,412
Start with one.

427
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,114
One, two, three, four, five.

428
00:29:53,223 --> 00:29:57,421
Good. Now, stop counting.

429
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:02,325
Let's go.

430
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:08,470
<i>You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.</i>

431
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:09,630
<i>My grandmother splits eights.</i>

432
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:12,299
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.

433
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:14,036
Look, you're choosing to play two hands

434
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:16,670
against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?

435
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,806
Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.

436
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,974
Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play.

437
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,712
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?

438
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,118
Choi, why don't you explain to Ben
how we do?

439
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:27,588
Oh, all right.

440
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:31,127
So, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,

441
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,957
spotters and big players, right?

442
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:36,522
So if you think that this table
is the casino floor,

443
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,433
then salt and pepper shakers
are your spotters.

444
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,335
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

445
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,773
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

446
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:49,869
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

447
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,711
That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.

448
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,877
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,

449
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,547
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

450
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,385
Right. And then when one of the decks
gets hot,

451
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,981
the spotter at that table signals
in the big player.

452
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:05,527
This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.

453
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:07,689
Well, I'm always the mustard, so...

454
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,962
When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,

455
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:15,971
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.

456
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:18,769
So the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

457
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:21,071
When the deck cools, he cashes in.

458
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:22,668
It's not as easy as it sounds.

459
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,212
Oh, yeah, it's not, you know,

460
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:26,943
because if Grey Poupon over here
ever loses the count,

461
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,884
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

462
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:32,581
- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.

463
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:33,881
Show us.

464
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,390
Okay, what's this?

465
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,893
- The deck's hot.
- Right.

466
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:39,860
We need to talk.

467
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,527
The deck's cooling.

468
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,795
And get out. Get out now.

469
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:51,601
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

470
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,573
There's a trial run?

471
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,975
- Where?
- You'll find out.

472
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,127
Hey.

473
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,616
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

474
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,285
Follow me.

475
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,826
This way.

476
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:30,468
Go, go. You go.

477
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,455
No more bet. No more bet.

478
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,489
Come on, money.

479
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,396
Today, 14.

480
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,265
Whose side are you on?

481
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:07,806
Sixteen.

482
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:10,007
Thank you. Sorry, gentlemen.

483
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,781
So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?

484
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:28,256
- You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. $300.

485
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:29,628
$300.

486
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,072
$300.

487
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:43,815
You bet, sir?

488
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:46,947
Thanks.

489
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,770
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

490
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:12,844
<i>" Winner, winner, chicken dinner." All right.</i>

491
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:17,177
Nice.

492
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,619
Can I get another drink, please?

493
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:25,221
Thank you.

494
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,826
What the hell are you doing?

495
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,058
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

496
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,794
Get off, I haven't done anything!

497
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,530
Please. Please let go.

498
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,436
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.

499
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:42,907
- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!

500
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,568
What's the count?

501
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,672
Plus 18.

502
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:55,512
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

503
00:35:55,622 --> 00:35:56,782
Congratulations, Ben.

504
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,120
Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.

505
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,989
Welcome to the team.

506
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:03,690
We didn't mean it.

507
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:06,732
It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag.

508
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:18,305
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

509
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:20,710
I want you to take Jimmy's place.

510
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:23,247
I've never done this.

511
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,578
I know that and I understand.

512
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:27,813
But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.

513
00:36:27,921 --> 00:36:30,083
Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,

514
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:31,988
and I've never had a student
as impressive as you.

515
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:34,323
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.

516
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:36,954
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

517
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:39,897
'Cause you remind me of myself
25 years ago.

518
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:42,294
You in?

519
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:46,904
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.

520
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:51,006
There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.

521
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:56,612
We're counting cards, we're not gambling.

522
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:59,944
We're following a specific set of rules
and playing a system.

523
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,042
Right.

524
00:37:01,154 --> 00:37:03,179
I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,

525
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,192
and sometimes, people lose control.

526
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:08,789
They give in to their emotions.

527
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:11,497
You will not.

528
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:14,258
You understand?

529
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:16,427
Yeah.

530
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:19,339
Get some rest.

531
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,999
- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

532
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,739
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy
paper due Tuesday.

533
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,273
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

534
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:30,248
No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly.

535
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:32,512
I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,

536
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,248
and he understood, so he gave you an A.

537
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:39,950
You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.

538
00:37:40,062 --> 00:37:42,655
You'll get a call about details later.

539
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,833
So did the girls go on ahead, huh?

540
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:49,267
Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags
to check, you know?

541
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,428
Okay.

542
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:53,439
Well, wait for us by security
'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.

543
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:54,633
No, I'm good.

544
00:37:54,742 --> 00:37:57,075
No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.

545
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:00,046
- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.

546
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:04,913
Honestly, I really don't have to go.

547
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:07,419
- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I really don't have to...

548
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:08,580
Please just shut up.

549
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,920
Why are you looking over there?
Look, I don't...

550
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:13,119
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.

551
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:15,423
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

552
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,862
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

553
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:21,597
Don't ask questions.

554
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:26,432
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

555
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:29,875
You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.

556
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:34,707
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

557
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:36,944
And we're not about
to have them confiscate $250,000.

558
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:38,781
$250,000?

559
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:42,850
- No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

560
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:46,154
You really suck at not asking questions.

561
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:52,195
What's a donkey boy?

562
00:38:53,802 --> 00:38:56,100
- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.

563
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:00,269
- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.

564
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:04,006
Act casual, think casual, be casual.

565
00:39:04,114 --> 00:39:06,809
Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.

566
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:08,246
Thank you.

567
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:13,814
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.

568
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:15,981
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

569
00:39:44,287 --> 00:39:45,276
Your boarding pass.

570
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:00,326
Sir?

571
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:14,678
You forgot your bag.

572
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:18,484
Thanks.

573
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:19,736
Nice going, Campbell.

574
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:24,507
Hey, Ben.
Basic strategy says you should hit that.

575
00:42:36,027 --> 00:42:39,723
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,

576
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,027
Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.

577
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:45,125
So glad you could make it.

578
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,235
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

579
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,637
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

580
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:50,901
You live in Washington, D.C.

581
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:54,775
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.

582
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:57,142
- I don't like my name.
- Why not?

583
00:42:57,748 --> 00:43:00,342
<i>" Sierra Sommers." Do I look like a Sierra?</i>

584
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:02,647
Well, you have a lot of clever outfits.
You'll figure it out.

585
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:05,917
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

586
00:43:06,024 --> 00:43:09,221
You know, I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?

587
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:11,557
Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.

588
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:14,359
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

589
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,730
and it allows everyone to be different people
in different casinos.

590
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:20,862
Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell.
That's the way it works.

591
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:22,671
Like I'm not going already.

592
00:43:22,774 --> 00:43:23,866
Yeah. All right. Now, listen.

593
00:43:23,975 --> 00:43:26,910
Ben, this is for you.
All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.

594
00:43:27,012 --> 00:43:28,377
<i>They're called " eyes in the sky."</i>

595
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,415
For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,

596
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:34,007
and at all times, you don't know each other.

597
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,420
Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.

598
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,750
And what's our motto?

599
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,793
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

600
00:43:42,894 --> 00:43:44,589
Thank you very much.

601
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,222
How come you don't play?

602
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:50,529
Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.

603
00:43:50,635 --> 00:43:53,537
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.

604
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,231
Welcome to Vegas.

605
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:06,609
No more bets.

606
00:44:06,718 --> 00:44:08,550
All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.

607
00:44:08,654 --> 00:44:11,714
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?

608
00:44:11,824 --> 00:44:14,554
Oh, see,
now that sounds really complicated.

609
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,821
- I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

610
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:19,591
Here to double my family's inheritance.

611
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:22,856
I don't know.

612
00:44:42,621 --> 00:44:44,088
$10,000.

613
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:46,991
Changing $10,000.

614
00:44:47,093 --> 00:44:48,958
Sweet. Too sweet.

615
00:45:09,648 --> 00:45:12,242
<i>Eight. The count's still plus 16.</i>

616
00:45:13,853 --> 00:45:15,821
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

617
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:17,783
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

618
00:45:19,192 --> 00:45:21,786
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

619
00:45:23,363 --> 00:45:25,330
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

620
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:29,961
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

621
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,368
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

622
00:45:33,673 --> 00:45:34,697
Can I split those?

623
00:45:34,808 --> 00:45:37,800
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.

624
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:47,542
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

625
00:45:50,924 --> 00:45:53,290
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

626
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:02,366
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

627
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:10,866
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

628
00:46:11,912 --> 00:46:13,937
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

629
00:46:14,414 --> 00:46:15,779
<i>Blackjack.</i>

630
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:02,995
Monkey! Monkey!

631
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:04,997
- So what's a monkey?
- Face card.

632
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:08,500
All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.

633
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,198
Monkey!

634
00:47:13,573 --> 00:47:14,972
Monkey! Come on, give us a monkey!

635
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:18,239
Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.

636
00:47:18,346 --> 00:47:19,836
Monkey! Monkey!

637
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,015
All right, all right.

638
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:30,750
Oh, God.

639
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,417
I need to quit.

640
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:40,392
Could I color up, please?

641
00:48:23,312 --> 00:48:24,677
Nice undies.

642
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:33,244
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

643
00:48:33,355 --> 00:48:35,185
We split it five ways.

644
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:42,124
So, what do you think?

645
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,857
Yeah, it was fun.

646
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:45,766
- You were good.
- Really?

647
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:49,303
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

648
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:53,363
You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.

649
00:48:55,176 --> 00:48:57,668
And you made more money than Fisher.

650
00:48:57,946 --> 00:49:00,506
I was pretty nervous, actually.

651
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:04,585
You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of easy.

652
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:07,912
Not for everyone.

653
00:49:08,023 --> 00:49:10,150
Yeah, it's just simple math.

654
00:49:10,726 --> 00:49:13,627
Good.
We can do some serious damage with you.

655
00:49:19,034 --> 00:49:21,366
Here's the thing I told Micky.

656
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:25,968
You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.

657
00:49:26,074 --> 00:49:28,736
You know, $300,000 and then I'm out.

658
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,407
That's what they all say.

659
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:37,811
No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this
to pay for Harvard.

660
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:40,387
It's just a means to an end for me.

661
00:49:42,257 --> 00:49:43,724
I believe you.

662
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:45,284
Good.

663
00:49:55,505 --> 00:49:58,564
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

664
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,364
Team meeting.

665
00:50:01,843 --> 00:50:03,071
Hello?

666
00:50:03,178 --> 00:50:04,440
- Hey.
- Hey.

667
00:50:04,813 --> 00:50:06,281
Where's everybody else?

668
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:09,146
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.

669
00:50:13,122 --> 00:50:15,249
Oh, Fisher, you didn't sleep.

670
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:20,084
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

671
00:50:20,595 --> 00:50:24,225
She's a dancer. I pulled her out of Sapphire.

672
00:50:24,767 --> 00:50:29,204
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

673
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:31,706
Where's Kianna?

674
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:33,168
Slots.

675
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:38,642
- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.

676
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,679
I've been busy this morning.

677
00:50:45,088 --> 00:50:46,487
All right, guys, let's get something clear.

678
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:48,819
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

679
00:50:48,925 --> 00:50:51,325
This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.

680
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:53,418
Kianna, slots are for losers.

681
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:55,690
Fisher, peelers are stealers.

682
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:57,057
Choi?

683
00:50:57,367 --> 00:51:01,530
You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens

684
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:05,437
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

685
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:09,602
But, Fisher,
what the hell were you up to last night?

686
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:11,003
What?

687
00:51:11,114 --> 00:51:14,107
Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,

688
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:15,412
but you kept on anyway.

689
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,111
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

690
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:19,155
In either case,
I don't wanna see it happen again.

691
00:51:19,256 --> 00:51:21,121
Jill, nice disguise last night.

692
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:25,888
And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.

693
00:51:26,963 --> 00:51:27,952
Beginner's luck.

694
00:51:28,064 --> 00:51:31,057
Hey, Fisher. Win like a man, lose like a man.

695
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:33,694
Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.

696
00:51:33,804 --> 00:51:35,135
You know what's worse than a loser?

697
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:38,470
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

698
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:40,440
Take it up with Ida.

699
00:51:41,645 --> 00:51:42,873
Who's Ida?

700
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:45,371
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

701
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,473
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

702
00:52:14,411 --> 00:52:16,402
There goes that paycheck.

703
00:52:24,355 --> 00:52:27,255
- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.

704
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:32,428
How's she doing?

705
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,127
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.

706
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:37,132
The way I see it, yesterday's history,
tomorrow's a mystery.

707
00:52:37,234 --> 00:52:40,033
It's all what you do in the moment, baby.

708
00:52:52,182 --> 00:52:54,241
Just lost another property.

709
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,721
- Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage?
- Caesars.

710
00:53:00,325 --> 00:53:02,384
That was a 14-year account.

711
00:53:02,727 --> 00:53:06,663
- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.

712
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:12,258
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.

713
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,168
Okay, Clark, I'll take a look at the tape.

714
00:53:15,373 --> 00:53:18,809
By the way, you wanna lose the cigarette?

715
00:53:20,278 --> 00:53:23,270
There's no smoking in here, you know that.

716
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,944
I appreciate it.

717
00:53:37,629 --> 00:53:39,597
End of an era, my friend.

718
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:50,671
Ben. Time for school.

719
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:56,673
I seem to keep waking up to you.

720
00:53:56,781 --> 00:53:58,442
Don't get used to it.

721
00:54:17,435 --> 00:54:19,927
I'm glad you came over this morning.

722
00:54:21,073 --> 00:54:24,042
- I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?

723
00:54:26,512 --> 00:54:28,537
I want you to have this.

724
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:30,510
What's this?

725
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,952
That's a lot of money.

726
00:54:38,457 --> 00:54:42,086
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

727
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:46,528
I know it won't pay the whole way,
but it should help.

728
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,700
Ma, I can't take this.

729
00:54:51,203 --> 00:54:53,329
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

730
00:54:53,438 --> 00:54:58,240
For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay
for med school, Dr. Campbell.

731
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:06,281
Well, you know what? You don't have to.

732
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:09,821
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.

733
00:55:10,589 --> 00:55:13,115
Yep, they're gonna pay the whole way.

734
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:17,459
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.

735
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:19,758
And actually, I just found out today.

736
00:55:19,865 --> 00:55:23,028
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

737
00:55:23,335 --> 00:55:26,600
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.

738
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,607
- I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.

739
00:55:34,713 --> 00:55:39,207
So, listen, you keep this, all right?
It's yours.

740
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:19,952
What are you doing?

741
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:24,929
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.

742
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:31,032
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

743
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,628
- No. Not really, never.
- No.

744
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,768
Right.

745
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:40,205
All right.

746
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,747
So where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.

747
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:46,512
Oh, yeah? I ended up
having to go to New Hampshire

748
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:49,019
to help my cousin move.

749
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:51,056
You didn't bring your cell phone?

750
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,888
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

751
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:59,295
No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here.
So, you know.

752
00:56:59,399 --> 00:57:01,765
Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.

753
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:03,096
Oh, yeah?

754
00:57:03,203 --> 00:57:05,433
We almost had a girl there.

755
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:10,971
- Republik?
- Yes.

756
00:57:11,479 --> 00:57:12,503
Let's do it!

757
00:57:21,888 --> 00:57:23,412
She is an eight.

758
00:57:23,756 --> 00:57:28,194
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

759
00:57:28,295 --> 00:57:31,264
Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.

760
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,889
That's right.

761
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:37,703
But if we win the 2.09, I'm asking her out.

762
00:57:45,946 --> 00:57:48,779
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only owe eight bucks.

763
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:58,189
Hey. Can I get you a beer?

764
00:58:00,094 --> 00:58:02,892
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

765
00:58:07,168 --> 00:58:09,659
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights?

766
00:58:10,104 --> 00:58:11,196
Hey.

767
00:58:16,043 --> 00:58:17,909
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

768
00:58:18,013 --> 00:58:19,503
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

769
00:58:20,382 --> 00:58:21,679
Thank you.

770
00:58:27,855 --> 00:58:30,221
Are those your friends over there?

771
00:58:33,794 --> 00:58:37,959
No. No, I've never seen them before
in my life.

772
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:42,130
Could you just excuse me for one second?

773
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:47,498
Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.

774
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:48,666
Yeah, we know.

775
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:49,800
Yeah, well, can you not?

776
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,674
I think it's gonna freak her out a bit,
don't you think?

777
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,409
Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.

778
00:58:55,517 --> 00:58:57,178
So how do you know her?

779
00:58:57,285 --> 00:59:00,777
Did you, like, take some self-help seminar
or something?

780
00:59:01,856 --> 00:59:02,914
What?

781
00:59:03,425 --> 00:59:06,985
- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.

782
00:59:07,261 --> 00:59:10,254
- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.

783
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:13,459
There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.

784
00:59:13,568 --> 00:59:15,160
It's getting ridiculous.

785
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:18,831
He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.

786
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,407
- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.

787
00:59:20,508 --> 00:59:22,499
They let him, and he does.

788
00:59:23,278 --> 00:59:26,145
He ends up with, like, two 19s and two 20s.

789
00:59:26,815 --> 00:59:29,306
The dealer turns over a 17.

790
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:31,146
It's soft. He needs to take another card.

791
00:59:31,253 --> 00:59:33,619
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?

792
00:59:33,722 --> 00:59:36,520
- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. My God.

793
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:40,157
Not a great Christmas that year.

794
00:59:42,698 --> 00:59:46,156
So, what does he think about what you do?
Does he know?

795
00:59:46,736 --> 00:59:48,896
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.

796
00:59:51,473 --> 00:59:53,270
My dad's gone, too.

797
01:00:06,222 --> 01:00:10,521
So, you know, when you came into the store
to ask me to join the team,

798
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,020
was that because...

799
01:00:13,428 --> 01:00:14,622
What?

800
01:00:14,963 --> 01:00:18,297
Well, you know,
was it because Micky asked you to?

801
01:00:21,437 --> 01:00:24,565
Look, we've had three classes together.

802
01:00:25,574 --> 01:00:28,543
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

803
01:00:28,644 --> 01:00:30,474
that nobody understood.

804
01:00:31,613 --> 01:00:35,812
You're the smartest person in every single
one of those classes, Ben.

805
01:00:35,918 --> 01:00:40,082
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

806
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:43,224
No, no, not so much...

807
01:00:43,326 --> 01:00:46,193
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.

808
01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:48,729
- It's not a problem.
- I don't know why I just did that.

809
01:00:48,831 --> 01:00:50,058
- Don't apologize.
- Are you sure?

810
01:00:50,165 --> 01:00:52,726
Yes. Shit, this is my stop.

811
01:00:52,835 --> 01:00:55,235
- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.

812
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:58,034
But, really, don't worry about it.

813
01:00:58,741 --> 01:01:01,904
I don't know,
it's just 'cause we've been drinking, and...

814
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:04,502
It's just we're on a team, we work together.

815
01:01:04,613 --> 01:01:07,047
- I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

816
01:01:07,149 --> 01:01:09,675
Okay. Sure. Bye.

817
01:01:29,806 --> 01:01:33,536
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

818
01:01:34,877 --> 01:01:37,846
<i>I had saved over $100,000.</i>

819
01:01:39,014 --> 01:01:41,073
<i>Only $200,000 to go.</i>

820
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:46,221
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

821
01:01:56,632 --> 01:01:58,328
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

822
01:01:58,435 --> 01:02:00,699
<i>the concept of vectors and formulas</i>

823
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:03,500
<i>were replaced with counting,
shuffle tracking</i>

824
01:02:03,607 --> 01:02:06,770
<i>knowing when to hit
and knowing when to color out.</i>

825
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,604
<i>I was becoming a pro on all levels.</i>

826
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,877
<i>I made more money in one trip to Vegas</i>

827
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:17,386
<i>than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.</i>

828
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:22,224
<i>In Boston, I was just Ben Campbell.</i>

829
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,991
<i>But in Vegas, I could be anyone I wanted.</i>

830
01:02:27,097 --> 01:02:29,395
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do?

831
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:32,765
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down
on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!

832
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:36,100
<i>One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir
to a pharmaceutical fortune.</i>

833
01:02:36,206 --> 01:02:39,334
Leon, could you make sure
there's some champagne,

834
01:02:39,743 --> 01:02:43,406
maybe some strawberries
waiting in there for me.

835
01:02:43,914 --> 01:02:45,245
I may not be alone.

836
01:02:45,348 --> 01:02:48,977
<i>The next, I'd be the hottest video game
designer on the West Coast.</i>

837
01:02:49,587 --> 01:02:50,986
There it is.

838
01:02:51,088 --> 01:02:54,580
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

839
01:02:58,662 --> 01:03:00,823
No, please, keep going.
This video's priceless.

840
01:03:02,332 --> 01:03:03,959
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

841
01:03:04,668 --> 01:03:09,163
<i>It did get, well, a little confusing sometimes.</i>

842
01:03:10,107 --> 01:03:11,699
<i>Operator, how can I help you?</i>

843
01:03:11,809 --> 01:03:14,107
Yeah, room service.

844
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:16,646
<i>Excuse me?
Honey, we don't do room service.</i>

845
01:03:16,747 --> 01:03:18,407
What do you mean,
you don't do room service?

846
01:03:18,515 --> 01:03:20,881
<i>I mean, we don't do room service.</i>

847
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,592
<i>In Boston, we had a secret.</i>

848
01:03:41,372 --> 01:03:44,466
<i>In Vegas, we had a life.</i>

849
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:57,388
<i>Micky said I was gonna have more fun
than I could possibly imagine.</i>

850
01:03:58,557 --> 01:04:00,114
<i>And he was right.</i>

851
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,154
- Hey, Jamie. There you go.
- Nice.

852
01:04:06,264 --> 01:04:07,959
<i>It was too good to be true.</i>

853
01:04:08,065 --> 01:04:12,092
There you go. All right,
my night just got better. Thank you, Joe.

854
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:16,038
<i>And it felt like it was never going to end.</i>

855
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:29,511
Clark? I think I got something over here.

856
01:04:30,221 --> 01:04:31,917
Take a look at this.

857
01:04:34,426 --> 01:04:36,894
That guy? He's a kid.

858
01:04:36,995 --> 01:04:40,726
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.

859
01:04:40,832 --> 01:04:43,197
Plus, he ordered a tonic and lime.

860
01:04:43,301 --> 01:04:45,997
Tonic and lime. What does that mean?

861
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:48,334
It means he wants you
to think he's drinking.

862
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,739
Okay. So is he counting
or is he just getting lucky?

863
01:04:51,944 --> 01:04:53,878
He's not running a progressive system.

864
01:04:53,979 --> 01:04:57,176
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.

865
01:04:57,282 --> 01:04:59,910
- How can you tell if it's heavy or light?
- I'm counting.

866
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:01,178
You...

867
01:05:04,522 --> 01:05:06,320
Tell me something, Cole,
if you can count that well,

868
01:05:06,425 --> 01:05:08,154
why are you still consulting for us?

869
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,727
I've been asking myself the same thing.

870
01:05:09,828 --> 01:05:13,264
Let's just say I like being
on your side of the hustle.

871
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:16,691
Bring up a frame of that for me
on the printer.

872
01:05:20,205 --> 01:05:22,697
So, Terry, I heard
you guys are losing a lot of work

873
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:25,834
to that biometric facial recognition software.

874
01:05:27,412 --> 01:05:31,007
Just gives us a little bit more time
to focus on you guys.

875
01:05:33,552 --> 01:05:36,282
- That's impressive software.
- They do.

876
01:05:36,955 --> 01:05:38,286
Here he is.

877
01:05:40,627 --> 01:05:43,687
I still think there're bigger fish
to fry out there.

878
01:05:43,796 --> 01:05:45,126
So do I.

879
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:54,597
Hey, Fisher.

880
01:05:54,706 --> 01:05:56,766
He's mad at me and jealous of you.

881
01:05:56,876 --> 01:05:59,367
But don't worry.
Greatness evokes that reaction sometimes.

882
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:02,414
- Don't worry about it. I gotta go.
- All right.

883
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:13,258
- Hey.
- What's going on?

884
01:06:14,494 --> 01:06:18,123
He just didn't like the subject
I chose for my final paper.

885
01:06:18,231 --> 01:06:19,858
- That's bullshit, Ben.
- What?

886
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:21,900
I know when you're lying,
I'm your best friend.

887
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:24,026
At least I thought I was.

888
01:06:25,171 --> 01:06:26,762
Are you on drugs, Ben?

889
01:06:26,872 --> 01:06:28,806
Because there's a group that meets
at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.

890
01:06:28,907 --> 01:06:30,842
No, no. Cam, I'm not on drugs, okay?

891
01:06:30,943 --> 01:06:33,707
I'll go to the meeting if you need me to.

892
01:06:34,313 --> 01:06:37,043
Why didn't you tell me you quit J. Press?

893
01:06:38,518 --> 01:06:39,951
I don't know.

894
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,650
- Is it Jill Taylor?
- No.

895
01:06:44,824 --> 01:06:46,485
What about Harvard?

896
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,622
It'll find a way of working itself out.

897
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:53,924
Look, I gotta go. I'll see you.

898
01:07:06,213 --> 01:07:10,308
<i>I think the worst part of it
was not being able to tell anyone.</i>

899
01:07:14,487 --> 01:07:18,617
<i>But for the first time in my life,
the world made itself easy for me.</i>

900
01:07:20,259 --> 01:07:21,386
Here you go, sir.

901
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,053
<i>And I liked it.</i>

902
01:07:23,764 --> 01:07:25,231
That's for you.

903
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:31,834
We just made $210,000.

904
01:07:31,938 --> 01:07:32,996
Yes.

905
01:07:33,106 --> 01:07:35,597
Now, Ben, this is how we play!

906
01:07:38,245 --> 01:07:40,679
<i>And play we did.</i>

907
01:07:44,918 --> 01:07:47,011
<i>Nothing cost too much.</i>

908
01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:49,646
<i>Nothing was out of reach.</i>

909
01:07:55,295 --> 01:07:58,128
<i>I guess you could say
the casino host of fate</i>

910
01:07:58,232 --> 01:08:00,826
<i>gave Ben Campbell a major upgrade.</i>

911
01:08:03,804 --> 01:08:06,671
<i>Dorm rooms turned into high-roller suites.</i>

912
01:08:08,342 --> 01:08:10,867
<i>Bicycles became stretch limos.</i>

913
01:08:14,515 --> 01:08:15,948
No, no!

914
01:08:19,253 --> 01:08:23,713
<i>And college bars that were always filled
with frat dudes were upgraded to,</i>

915
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:28,460
<i>well, something more interesting.</i>

916
01:09:22,317 --> 01:09:26,083
- Hey, baby. Where you in from?
- I'm from Boston.

917
01:09:27,355 --> 01:09:31,257
- On a convention?
- No, business, actually.

918
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,827
What line of work you in, mister?

919
01:09:36,563 --> 01:09:38,327
I count things.

920
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:42,093
My name's Sierra.

921
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:47,903
Hi, Sierra. I'm Salvador Sanchez.

922
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:52,675
Would you like a private dance, Salvador?

923
01:09:54,283 --> 01:09:58,184
Well, that all depends
on how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.

924
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:03,316
$20 a song, 30-song minimum.

925
01:10:05,193 --> 01:10:06,785
Sounds expensive.

926
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:30,308
- Good evening, Mr. Klein.
- Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.

927
01:10:30,419 --> 01:10:32,910
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.

928
01:10:34,023 --> 01:10:35,991
You are so lucky you're cute.

929
01:10:36,091 --> 01:10:38,787
'Cause if you weren't cute, I'd leave.
You know that?

930
01:10:38,894 --> 01:10:42,454
Jeffrey. My brother from another mother.

931
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,123
How you doing? You good?

932
01:10:44,232 --> 01:10:47,430
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K.
What, are you back in town for business?

933
01:10:47,536 --> 01:10:52,667
- It's all business in this town, right?
- Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.

934
01:10:53,575 --> 01:10:55,509
Oh, damn, I forgot my ring.

935
01:10:55,611 --> 01:10:57,511
Oh, please.

936
01:11:04,286 --> 01:11:07,551
I don't wanna bet that. That's for keep.

937
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:09,585
$100,000 going out.

938
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:13,622
Thank you, Jeffrey.

939
01:11:20,837 --> 01:11:22,895
Cole. Your boy's back.

940
01:11:26,909 --> 01:11:28,467
- That's him, right?
- There he is.

941
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:31,603
And he brought
a whole lot more money with him.

942
01:11:38,755 --> 01:11:41,315
That is a hell of a suit, by the way.

943
01:11:56,906 --> 01:12:01,138
- That is some aftershave he has going on.
- Sir, could you not? Please.

944
01:12:06,148 --> 01:12:09,516
This girl's only betting the table minimum.
Why's she keep looking at him?

945
01:12:09,619 --> 01:12:14,318
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see
if she signals him to come to the table.

946
01:12:15,725 --> 01:12:19,320
<i>We don't use " tape" anymore, old school.
It's digital now.</i>

947
01:12:21,731 --> 01:12:23,892
Never mind. Terry, rewind it.

948
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:28,294
Okay, okay.

949
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:30,700
She's playing the table minimum.

950
01:12:30,807 --> 01:12:32,968
Now, in a second,
she's gonna do something.

951
01:12:33,076 --> 01:12:36,944
She's gonna raise her hand,
scratch her head... There it is.

952
01:12:38,114 --> 01:12:41,049
That's the signal. See?
She gave him the signal.

953
01:12:41,151 --> 01:12:44,485
He comes to the table.
I'm telling you, they're working together.

954
01:12:44,588 --> 01:12:45,645
Nice.

955
01:12:47,323 --> 01:12:49,883
Show me a computer that can do that.

956
01:12:54,731 --> 01:12:56,358
You look familiar.

957
01:12:57,667 --> 01:12:59,430
I know you, don't I?

958
01:13:01,038 --> 01:13:02,869
- I don't think so.
- No?

959
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:07,672
<i>Oh, sure, you look exactly like that guy
in Rain Man.</i>

960
01:13:10,013 --> 01:13:12,846
Oh, yeah? Well, people say
I look like Tom Cruise all the time.

961
01:13:12,949 --> 01:13:14,644
Oh, yeah? No.

962
01:13:15,752 --> 01:13:19,416
The other one, the... What's his... The retard.

963
01:13:20,424 --> 01:13:25,657
I just love that scene in Vegas
when the retard wins at blackjack.

964
01:13:26,597 --> 01:13:28,530
You look just like that.

965
01:13:32,402 --> 01:13:39,275
What I could never understand, though,
is how someone so retarded,

966
01:13:40,177 --> 01:13:41,872
could win so much.

967
01:13:44,248 --> 01:13:47,740
Hey, Jeffrey,
his brother from another mother,

968
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:49,614
how did that retard win so much?

969
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:52,655
- You know what, sir? I think that maybe...
- Okay, get your hands off me.

970
01:13:52,756 --> 01:13:54,951
Oh, I didn't mean it.

971
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:32,357
His luck'll run out eventually.
It always does.

972
01:14:42,741 --> 01:14:44,971
- Hey, Ben...
- No, Ben, stop it!

973
01:14:45,076 --> 01:14:46,941
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, come on! Ben!

974
01:14:47,045 --> 01:14:50,503
Oh, you think that's funny?
You think that was funny? Shut up!

975
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:51,979
I understand, Ben. We don't need anymore...

976
01:14:52,082 --> 01:14:53,913
This is not the time. Okay?

977
01:14:54,018 --> 01:14:56,816
I want to thank you
for confirming my choice in Ben.

978
01:14:56,921 --> 01:14:58,286
Now go home.

979
01:15:04,663 --> 01:15:06,654
- What?
- You're off the team.

980
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:07,823
No.

981
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:12,200
- I was drunk, I was...
- I don't care what you were.

982
01:15:13,437 --> 01:15:14,734
I'm not leaving.

983
01:15:14,838 --> 01:15:17,364
Yes, you are.

984
01:15:17,876 --> 01:15:20,344
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

985
01:15:24,216 --> 01:15:28,084
You've been the big man for a long time,
but you just acted like a child.

986
01:15:28,186 --> 01:15:31,314
So I want you to pick up the ticket
and go home,

987
01:15:31,423 --> 01:15:35,450
because if you don't,
you know exactly what I'm capable of doing,

988
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:37,358
don't you?

989
01:15:54,614 --> 01:15:55,602
All right, listen up.

990
01:15:55,714 --> 01:15:59,241
Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.

991
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:02,218
That means we got less than 24 hours
to cash in,

992
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,584
or we're gonna be sitting
with 200 grand of worthless plastic.

993
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:06,919
- So we'll cash out.
- It's too hot.

994
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:10,928
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in
the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.

995
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:13,225
So let's do it right now
before they can do that.

996
01:16:13,332 --> 01:16:15,300
Are you deliberately slow?

997
01:16:16,134 --> 01:16:17,692
What about them?

998
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:20,628
What about them?

999
01:16:20,739 --> 01:16:25,040
They can cash in the chips.
The casino's just gonna think they're tips.

1000
01:16:32,485 --> 01:16:33,918
- Cashing out.
- Thank you.

1001
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,113
- Thank you.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1002
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:39,155
- Thanks, hon.
- Thank you, baby.

1003
01:16:43,829 --> 01:16:45,888
I love a parade, don't you?

1004
01:16:47,066 --> 01:16:50,832
You know, there's a word
I don't throw around all that often,

1005
01:16:51,437 --> 01:16:52,665
<i>" Genius."</i>

1006
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:24,193
Hey, Kianna.
Let me hold your bag for a second.

1007
01:17:24,904 --> 01:17:26,166
Thanks, baby, here.

1008
01:17:26,272 --> 01:17:27,762
Oh, no problem. Anytime.

1009
01:17:27,873 --> 01:17:30,774
- Watch. Watch, watch. Ready?
- Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.

1010
01:17:30,876 --> 01:17:31,865
Watch.

1011
01:17:31,977 --> 01:17:35,709
No, it's great, you just need
to get your knee a little higher.

1012
01:17:57,871 --> 01:17:59,395
- Hi.
- Hey.

1013
01:18:00,774 --> 01:18:03,207
So the Hard Rock comped me a suite.

1014
01:18:04,443 --> 01:18:06,412
That's cool, that's great.

1015
01:18:09,483 --> 01:18:11,178
You wanna see it?

1016
01:19:13,547 --> 01:19:16,210
All right, take care, Bobby. All right?

1017
01:19:36,704 --> 01:19:38,228
God, it's cold.

1018
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:40,573
Hey, what time is it?

1019
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:44,705
He's only 45 minutes late.
Show a little patience.

1020
01:19:46,112 --> 01:19:48,172
Oh, look. Here he comes.

1021
01:19:48,983 --> 01:19:50,974
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

1022
01:19:51,085 --> 01:19:52,313
Hey, Ben.

1023
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:54,384
You know, you could try
returning a call once in a while.

1024
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,650
Good of you to show up, man.
It's not like we're cold or anything.

1025
01:19:56,757 --> 01:19:58,122
Yeah, funny.

1026
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:03,056
- Hey, did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it. There it is.

1027
01:20:03,164 --> 01:20:06,100
And you're sure
you didn't inlay the software on more space

1028
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:07,394
than the parameters suggest?

1029
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:09,527
No. It's just one-fifth of the free face.

1030
01:20:09,637 --> 01:20:11,628
Let's fire this mother up.

1031
01:20:11,739 --> 01:20:13,001
Beautiful.

1032
01:20:21,849 --> 01:20:23,078
Okay.

1033
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:24,711
Okay.

1034
01:20:28,222 --> 01:20:29,814
What's happening?

1035
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,685
- I don't understand.
- It's the wrong size.

1036
01:20:35,796 --> 01:20:37,058
No. What?

1037
01:20:38,132 --> 01:20:41,432
- What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K.
- Right.

1038
01:20:43,105 --> 01:20:45,005
Yeah, we needed 16K!

1039
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:50,240
- I can't believe this.
- I thought it was an 8K.

1040
01:20:50,344 --> 01:20:51,936
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

1041
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:56,279
No, you didn't. You knew the entire time
the discrete was 16K.

1042
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:58,047
Damn it, Ben.

1043
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:01,418
It's gonna take us two weeks
to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.

1044
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,924
And another five days, minimum,
to get it ready to press.

1045
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:08,463
Miles, calm down, all right?
It was an honest mistake.

1046
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:12,395
What?

1047
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:19,503
You know what? I think we're gonna have
to go at this without you, man.

1048
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,304
You're gonna what?

1049
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:28,742
No, no.
This is just as much mine as it is yours.

1050
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:31,444
We've been working on this for over a year.

1051
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:35,114
I know that.
But your heart just isn't in this anymore.

1052
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,454
Are you serious?

1053
01:21:49,172 --> 01:21:50,196
Fine.

1054
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,132
Fine.

1055
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:58,775
You know what? I don't even care.
Honestly, I don't even care.

1056
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,108
You know why?

1057
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:04,585
'Cause no one in the real world gives a shit
about the 2.09 Competition.

1058
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:07,553
You know, it's just something
that you build up in your head

1059
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:09,648
to make yourselves feel important.

1060
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:11,659
You guys are pathetic.

1061
01:22:11,761 --> 01:22:12,921
Thanks.

1062
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:21,301
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.

1063
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:25,170
- Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1064
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:31,803
Good evening, Mr. Youngman,
welcome back to the Red Rock.

1065
01:22:31,914 --> 01:22:33,381
Nice to see you.

1066
01:22:33,483 --> 01:22:36,144
Anything I can do for you, let me know.

1067
01:22:53,703 --> 01:22:55,069
Double down.

1068
01:23:30,808 --> 01:23:33,834
I guess you play big or you don't play at all.

1069
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:36,273
Right?

1070
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:42,808
Honey, there you are. Let's go.
We don't wanna miss the show!

1071
01:23:42,919 --> 01:23:45,718
Honey, we're actually playing a game here.

1072
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,282
Yeah.

1073
01:23:47,691 --> 01:23:49,454
Yeah, so you know what?

1074
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,621
Why don't you run upstairs
and wait for me there? Okay?

1075
01:23:56,233 --> 01:23:58,064
All right. Let's go.

1076
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,231
Yeah, all right.

1077
01:24:05,843 --> 01:24:08,437
I've got the worst headache right now.

1078
01:24:22,459 --> 01:24:24,290
- Ten.
- Come on, monkey.

1079
01:24:24,394 --> 01:24:26,760
- Fourteen.
- Come on. Come on, monkey.

1080
01:24:26,864 --> 01:24:28,991
- Sixteen.
- Monkey. Come on.

1081
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,733
Twenty-one.

1082
01:24:38,176 --> 01:24:40,110
Pete, you're killing us.

1083
01:24:53,357 --> 01:24:55,349
I guess it's not my night.

1084
01:25:20,285 --> 01:25:22,412
Are you out of your mind?

1085
01:25:23,787 --> 01:25:25,812
I don't know what happened.

1086
01:25:26,089 --> 01:25:28,718
I messed up. I'm sorry.

1087
01:25:29,894 --> 01:25:31,122
Oh, you're sorry.

1088
01:25:31,229 --> 01:25:34,824
Well, see, now that's what I've been waiting
to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.

1089
01:25:34,933 --> 01:25:39,495
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry!
Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!

1090
01:25:39,604 --> 01:25:43,665
So we can all go back to being friends
and laughing over cocktails!

1091
01:25:44,876 --> 01:25:46,241
Come on, Micky. It can happen to anyone.

1092
01:25:46,344 --> 01:25:47,777
They get on a rush and they lose control.

1093
01:25:47,879 --> 01:25:49,506
You shut your mouth. This is business.

1094
01:25:49,614 --> 01:25:52,981
Hey, I let you down, all right? I get it.

1095
01:25:53,084 --> 01:25:56,918
Excuse me? You let me down? I don't care!

1096
01:25:57,555 --> 01:26:00,683
Let me make one thing clear to you,
I am not your father!

1097
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:03,819
You are not my friend. This is a business.

1098
01:26:04,096 --> 01:26:06,222
You are only as good to me
as the money you make,

1099
01:26:06,331 --> 01:26:08,026
and, right now, it's not worth a hell of a lot!

1100
01:26:08,132 --> 01:26:09,861
You're gonna give me back
everything you lost.

1101
01:26:09,968 --> 01:26:12,732
I can't do that! That money was for Harvard!

1102
01:26:12,837 --> 01:26:14,737
I have made you so much more
than what I just lost!

1103
01:26:14,839 --> 01:26:16,670
It doesn't matter, Ben.

1104
01:26:16,774 --> 01:26:19,903
You had very clear instructions,
and you didn't follow them.

1105
01:26:20,012 --> 01:26:23,948
You didn't do your job.
You weren't counting, you were gambling!

1106
01:26:26,484 --> 01:26:29,385
Well, why aren't you out there, then, Micky?

1107
01:26:29,954 --> 01:26:34,653
I mean, we take all the risks.
Seems to me like you don't do shit.

1108
01:26:39,365 --> 01:26:41,299
This isn't about me,

1109
01:26:42,134 --> 01:26:45,831
you arrogant little infant.

1110
01:26:58,751 --> 01:27:01,379
You can all find your own way
back to Boston.

1111
01:27:01,487 --> 01:27:05,548
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.

1112
01:27:05,658 --> 01:27:07,649
And you damn well know it.

1113
01:27:17,736 --> 01:27:19,226
I need a drink.

1114
01:27:22,074 --> 01:27:23,507
Anybody else?

1115
01:27:26,546 --> 01:27:28,275
Yeah, well, we don't need him.

1116
01:27:28,381 --> 01:27:30,041
- Yeah, okay, Ben.
- No, I'm serious.

1117
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:32,811
Why do we need him?
We have our own money now.

1118
01:27:32,918 --> 01:27:36,183
You know, his cut was 50%,
and he doesn't even play!

1119
01:27:36,755 --> 01:27:37,915
Why do we need him?

1120
01:27:38,023 --> 01:27:39,115
Hey, you know what I think?

1121
01:27:39,224 --> 01:27:42,557
I think we play out the weekend,
and I think we do this without him.

1122
01:27:42,661 --> 01:27:44,061
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.

1123
01:27:44,164 --> 01:27:46,394
I think we should go back to Boston
and figure this out.

1124
01:27:46,499 --> 01:27:48,296
Yeah, well,
why don't we let the team decide?

1125
01:27:48,401 --> 01:27:51,528
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing.
Micky brought us together.

1126
01:27:51,637 --> 01:27:53,628
And then he drove us apart.

1127
01:27:53,739 --> 01:27:56,765
I mean, you saw
how he played Fisher against me.

1128
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:01,340
Choi, what do you say, man?
You wanna make some money?

1129
01:28:02,849 --> 01:28:04,510
- Kind of.
- Really?

1130
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:08,550
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.

1131
01:28:08,655 --> 01:28:11,817
All I'm saying is that we try it. You know?

1132
01:28:11,924 --> 01:28:15,724
If we make the investment,
then we take all of the winnings.

1133
01:28:16,795 --> 01:28:18,093
All of it.

1134
01:28:25,238 --> 01:28:26,535
Okay.

1135
01:28:30,844 --> 01:28:31,902
Yeah.

1136
01:28:32,378 --> 01:28:34,438
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1137
01:28:36,182 --> 01:28:37,376
Choi?

1138
01:28:38,752 --> 01:28:40,014
I'm in.

1139
01:28:41,888 --> 01:28:43,583
Now I need a drink.

1140
01:28:49,562 --> 01:28:51,326
- What are you doing?
- What?

1141
01:28:51,432 --> 01:28:53,399
What are you doing?

1142
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,559
Well, we're printing money.

1143
01:28:56,002 --> 01:28:58,698
What, you think just 'cause Micky left
that we're gonna stop?

1144
01:28:58,805 --> 01:29:01,603
No, I could do this. I can lead this team.

1145
01:29:01,975 --> 01:29:05,240
You know, I'm not the same guy
I was back in Boston.

1146
01:29:05,712 --> 01:29:07,942
- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.

1147
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:11,077
You know, isn't this exactly
who you wanted me to be

1148
01:29:11,185 --> 01:29:14,176
when you first came into the store
to buy a tie?

1149
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:21,120
<i>What happened to " $300,000 and I'm out"?</i>

1150
01:29:22,062 --> 01:29:24,758
<i>What happened to " a means to an end"?</i>

1151
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:28,532
- How much do you have?
- What?

1152
01:29:28,636 --> 01:29:30,831
- How much do you have?
- I got enough.

1153
01:29:30,938 --> 01:29:33,168
Come on, Ben. How much do you have
saved back in Boston?

1154
01:29:33,274 --> 01:29:35,798
I've got 315 grand, all right?

1155
01:29:36,176 --> 01:29:38,474
Then why are you still here?

1156
01:29:39,813 --> 01:29:43,773
Because I wanna still be here.
I like being here.

1157
01:29:44,218 --> 01:29:46,083
So does everybody else.

1158
01:29:46,487 --> 01:29:49,183
So come on, Jill. Are you in?

1159
01:29:55,062 --> 01:29:57,825
You are the big player, Ben.

1160
01:29:57,931 --> 01:29:59,297
Yes, I am.

1161
01:30:01,735 --> 01:30:03,635
Yeah, can I get a drink?

1162
01:30:31,565 --> 01:30:33,500
Rose, I wanna thank you.

1163
01:30:34,536 --> 01:30:36,902
You have been most accommodating.

1164
01:30:37,472 --> 01:30:39,439
All right, that's for you.

1165
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:42,038
Okay, take care. Hey, good luck.

1166
01:30:49,617 --> 01:30:51,609
Hey, how we doing here, people?

1167
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:06,331
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold
while I track him down.

1168
01:31:09,938 --> 01:31:12,065
Just got an interesting call.

1169
01:31:14,176 --> 01:31:18,237
There's nobody left to fire us.
Planet Hollywood is our last client.

1170
01:31:20,681 --> 01:31:22,581
I don't know about that.

1171
01:31:28,223 --> 01:31:29,656
This is Cole.

1172
01:31:40,435 --> 01:31:43,233
Queen of diamonds. Your lady luck tonight.

1173
01:31:43,738 --> 01:31:45,365
You're doing good.

1174
01:31:45,674 --> 01:31:47,437
You're a real winner.

1175
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:54,910
Sometimes. Just like everybody else.

1176
01:31:55,984 --> 01:31:58,180
Now, why don't I believe that?

1177
01:32:00,289 --> 01:32:02,348
Maybe you're just smarter
than everybody else, huh?

1178
01:32:02,457 --> 01:32:05,119
Yeah, I bet it's been that way your entire life.

1179
01:32:05,227 --> 01:32:08,993
Except it just recently started
paying dividends, am I right?

1180
01:32:10,732 --> 01:32:12,097
I'd split them.

1181
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:16,638
Deck's heavy as hell and since
I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.

1182
01:32:23,446 --> 01:32:25,538
Kianna. I think
we have a serious problem over there.

1183
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:27,114
- Walk now!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1184
01:32:27,215 --> 01:32:30,275
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you.
Let's go, Jill. Let's go.

1185
01:32:30,385 --> 01:32:32,115
I think we need
to call security or something.

1186
01:32:32,221 --> 01:32:35,816
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help.
Let's go! Come on.

1187
01:32:40,429 --> 01:32:42,397
Let's take a walk, huh?

1188
01:32:43,132 --> 01:32:46,897
Come on, kid.
See if we can't get you that chicken dinner.

1189
01:32:52,074 --> 01:32:54,668
It's called Biometrics.

1190
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:59,009
Biometrics.
It's sort of like a fingerprint of your face.

1191
01:33:01,651 --> 01:33:06,884
See, when the player sits down
at the table, the software, it reads this...

1192
01:33:06,989 --> 01:33:08,456
Biometric profile.

1193
01:33:08,557 --> 01:33:10,320
...biometric profile of your face,

1194
01:33:10,426 --> 01:33:13,452
cross-references it
with a database of counters.

1195
01:33:16,999 --> 01:33:21,800
Software'll probably put you and me
out of business, but it still can't do this.

1196
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:26,272
All right.

1197
01:33:31,847 --> 01:33:34,714
You understand all this. You go to MIT.

1198
01:33:35,084 --> 01:33:36,483
Smart boy.

1199
01:33:37,953 --> 01:33:39,887
My name is Cole Williams.

1200
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,755
And if I ever see you in this town again,

1201
01:33:44,528 --> 01:33:47,928
I will break your cheek bone
with a small hammer,

1202
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,156
and then I will kill you.

1203
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:59,400
Please. Please just take the money.

1204
01:34:00,644 --> 01:34:02,168
You can take it.

1205
01:34:04,881 --> 01:34:06,212
Tell me,

1206
01:34:06,783 --> 01:34:11,515
how's good old Professor Rosa doing, huh?

1207
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:17,786
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky, we go way back.

1208
01:34:18,895 --> 01:34:21,887
I spent years, chased him all over this town.

1209
01:34:22,332 --> 01:34:27,292
Giving him beat downs left and right,
only to find him at the tables a week later.

1210
01:34:27,404 --> 01:34:29,372
He was very persistent.

1211
01:34:30,272 --> 01:34:33,572
And then, one September night,

1212
01:34:34,077 --> 01:34:36,978
when I was in Barstow
at my father's funeral,

1213
01:34:37,848 --> 01:34:41,284
my casino was taken for seven figures.

1214
01:34:41,385 --> 01:34:42,716
Can you imagine that?

1215
01:34:42,819 --> 01:34:46,050
The most ever taken by a single counter
in one night.

1216
01:34:46,156 --> 01:34:50,752
'Course I was, naturally,
unceremoniously fired.

1217
01:34:53,463 --> 01:34:55,226
Funny thing, though.

1218
01:34:55,632 --> 01:34:58,157
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.

1219
01:34:59,336 --> 01:35:00,462
Never.

1220
01:36:27,191 --> 01:36:29,318
<i>Cauchy was the first
to make a rigorous study</i>

1221
01:36:29,427 --> 01:36:33,455
of the conditions for convergence
of an infinite series.

1222
01:36:33,565 --> 01:36:35,863
And was concerned with developing

1223
01:36:35,967 --> 01:36:40,836
the basic theorems of the calculus
as rigorously as possible.

1224
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,673
Any questions?

1225
01:36:44,075 --> 01:36:46,202
No? All right, moving on.

1226
01:36:47,246 --> 01:36:51,239
Isn't it true Cauchy stole from his students?

1227
01:36:56,154 --> 01:37:00,021
Yes, I heard that.
What's your theory on that?

1228
01:37:01,058 --> 01:37:05,587
They say he used his students
for their brilliance,

1229
01:37:06,732 --> 01:37:10,964
then discredited them
and stole their equations,

1230
01:37:13,038 --> 01:37:14,903
stole their hard work.

1231
01:37:17,609 --> 01:37:20,304
Well, that wouldn't be the first time
a teacher was accused of that.

1232
01:37:20,411 --> 01:37:25,111
I think what he's referring to
is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?

1233
01:37:25,217 --> 01:37:28,152
He was a student of Cauchy's
who accused Cauchy

1234
01:37:28,253 --> 01:37:31,586
of stealing his four-volume text
on this analysis

1235
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:34,158
and publishing it under a pseudonym.

1236
01:37:35,994 --> 01:37:37,655
Of course, nobody knows
what really went down there.

1237
01:37:37,764 --> 01:37:41,756
They never did prove it, and without
the proof, it's a little like it never happened.

1238
01:37:41,867 --> 01:37:43,892
And, you know, it's a real shame,

1239
01:37:44,002 --> 01:37:48,200
because if Stupnitsky had just realized
that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,

1240
01:37:48,307 --> 01:37:50,036
this was the dispute,

1241
01:37:51,076 --> 01:37:57,073
if he'd been able to get beyond some
of the personal mistakes that were made,

1242
01:37:57,617 --> 01:38:00,847
I have no doubt that Cauchy
would have worked with him again,

1243
01:38:00,953 --> 01:38:03,979
and they could have
done great things together.

1244
01:38:04,389 --> 01:38:08,450
But, as history shows us,
some students never learn.

1245
01:38:10,162 --> 01:38:11,824
You should get that eye looked at.

1246
01:38:49,035 --> 01:38:50,434
You okay?

1247
01:38:53,406 --> 01:38:55,033
Everything's gone.

1248
01:38:56,843 --> 01:38:59,437
- What?
- Micky's taken everything.

1249
01:38:59,545 --> 01:39:03,777
He's taken the money,
taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.

1250
01:39:05,652 --> 01:39:07,745
- What are you talking about?
- Micky, he's taken everything.

1251
01:39:07,854 --> 01:39:10,254
I gotta find a way to get it back.

1252
01:39:11,557 --> 01:39:13,047
Are you insane?

1253
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:17,221
You just got the shit kicked out of you
and you won't let this go!

1254
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:21,267
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill?
I've just lost everything!

1255
01:39:22,036 --> 01:39:23,526
Look, please...

1256
01:39:25,338 --> 01:39:27,602
I don't want to lose you, too.

1257
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:34,205
Ben, you were dragged away in Vegas.

1258
01:39:34,881 --> 01:39:39,216
I haven't heard from you.
I had no idea where you were.

1259
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,148
I know.

1260
01:39:42,122 --> 01:39:43,282
I know.

1261
01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:53,428
You know, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

1262
01:39:55,235 --> 01:39:56,600
I'm sorry.

1263
01:39:59,473 --> 01:40:03,967
In Vegas, I don't know what happened.
That wasn't me.

1264
01:40:05,179 --> 01:40:06,805
Look, you know me.

1265
01:40:07,513 --> 01:40:09,378
You know what I'm like.

1266
01:40:11,185 --> 01:40:12,675
You know me.

1267
01:40:19,126 --> 01:40:20,991
I need you to trust me.

1268
01:40:22,329 --> 01:40:25,696
<i>And the winner of this year's 2.09</i>

1269
01:40:25,799 --> 01:40:32,068
<i>for excellence in the field of robotics
goes to the team of Conolly and Kazazi!</i>

1270
01:41:09,443 --> 01:41:12,412
That's it. That's the story.

1271
01:41:14,915 --> 01:41:17,145
Jill Taylor. Really?

1272
01:41:17,951 --> 01:41:21,444
- Yeah. Yeah, really.
- Wow.

1273
01:41:21,556 --> 01:41:25,754
<i>Yeah, it doesn't feel like " wow," Miles.
I really screwed up.</i>

1274
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:30,592
Yeah, you did.
But you had a life experience.

1275
01:41:35,035 --> 01:41:37,027
I can't believe how I treated you, Miles.

1276
01:41:37,138 --> 01:41:41,040
You know, you're my best friend,
and I really let you down.

1277
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:45,004
I really let you down. I'm sorry.

1278
01:41:46,815 --> 01:41:51,343
And I'm happy for you, you know?
Winning the 2.09? That's great.

1279
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:55,188
- Jill Taylor. Really?
- Yeah.

1280
01:41:57,725 --> 01:41:59,818
So let me get this straight.

1281
01:42:00,495 --> 01:42:03,658
Money, girls,

1282
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:09,236
high-roller suites, clubs, Vegas.

1283
01:42:10,439 --> 01:42:15,466
Yeah, I think I probably would have
blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.

1284
01:42:19,013 --> 01:42:20,378
So we cool?

1285
01:42:22,016 --> 01:42:23,608
Yeah, we're cool.

1286
01:42:24,118 --> 01:42:26,815
But you better believe that
you're gonna make this up to me, big time.

1287
01:42:26,922 --> 01:42:28,184
All right.

1288
01:42:29,491 --> 01:42:31,618
So, what are you gonna do now?

1289
01:43:22,411 --> 01:43:24,242
What do you want, Ben?
This is an alumni dinner.

1290
01:43:24,346 --> 01:43:26,712
You need a diploma
to come to one of these.

1291
01:43:26,815 --> 01:43:29,215
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.

1292
01:43:35,425 --> 01:43:36,392
What?

1293
01:43:36,493 --> 01:43:40,622
Look, I've had some time
to think about what you said.

1294
01:43:42,498 --> 01:43:43,988
I want back in.

1295
01:43:44,967 --> 01:43:48,835
- Why now?
- Because I have nothing else.

1296
01:43:50,706 --> 01:43:53,904
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're good, you're very, very good.

1297
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:58,173
But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.

1298
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:01,977
Now you tell me why in the world
I'd ever get back in business with you.

1299
01:44:02,084 --> 01:44:06,544
Look, I know I should never have
disrespected you, all right? I know that.

1300
01:44:07,523 --> 01:44:09,492
With this facial recognition software,

1301
01:44:09,592 --> 01:44:12,789
our window of opportunity
is closing in on us.

1302
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:16,993
Now, I need this, Micky.
I really, really need this.

1303
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:22,230
Well, the take would have to be really, really
good to get me even vaguely interested.

1304
01:44:23,739 --> 01:44:29,042
Well, you know, that's why I was thinking
maybe you should be the other big player.

1305
01:44:30,447 --> 01:44:33,780
You know, two big players playing big?

1306
01:44:34,951 --> 01:44:38,284
Hey, slow down,
I haven't played in a long time, Ben.

1307
01:44:42,726 --> 01:44:44,318
But Fisher's out.

1308
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:49,564
No one else on the team
can be the big player, can they?

1309
01:44:52,802 --> 01:44:56,203
And if we do well, if we do really well,

1310
01:44:56,973 --> 01:45:00,137
then you get your grades back,
get to Harvard Med,

1311
01:45:01,144 --> 01:45:03,669
and I might even get that sabbatical.

1312
01:45:04,681 --> 01:45:09,141
Well, amazing things can be done
from the inside, right?

1313
01:45:11,087 --> 01:45:13,783
Just went back to the head of the class.

1314
01:45:15,058 --> 01:45:16,924
I gotta go be social.

1315
01:45:22,298 --> 01:45:25,597
All right, now listen.
It's different out there this time.

1316
01:45:25,702 --> 01:45:28,569
The stakes are high
and it's more dangerous.

1317
01:45:29,105 --> 01:45:32,165
But the return is gonna be the biggest.

1318
01:45:33,477 --> 01:45:36,913
Now they know our faces,
so we're gonna wear disguises.

1319
01:45:37,148 --> 01:45:39,116
And we can't mess around.

1320
01:45:39,483 --> 01:45:40,950
I'm glad you're back with us, Micky.

1321
01:45:41,052 --> 01:45:42,951
Well, I couldn't let you guys
come back to this town

1322
01:45:43,053 --> 01:45:46,545
and not prove to Ben
that I can do more than just teach.

1323
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:51,293
But as we've all said, this game
is about the past and the future,

1324
01:45:51,395 --> 01:45:54,455
and tonight we forget about the past.

1325
01:45:54,698 --> 01:45:56,563
We just focus on the future.

1326
01:45:56,667 --> 01:46:00,000
Right. This is our last time.

1327
01:46:00,404 --> 01:46:03,430
Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly.
We meet at the Fox Strip Club.

1328
01:46:03,541 --> 01:46:05,872
Nobody leaves this town alone.

1329
01:46:09,346 --> 01:46:11,246
Let's go make a killing.

1330
01:46:11,782 --> 01:46:13,147
All right.

1331
01:46:35,272 --> 01:46:37,740
Let's see what we can do with this.

1332
01:46:46,851 --> 01:46:50,912
Seems like I'm having one of those days,
you know what I mean, Jim?

1333
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:54,717
I'm bringing all the luck today.
I'm just bringing it all.

1334
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:59,286
Anyone who's in any kind of contact
with me is getting so much luck today.

1335
01:47:10,941 --> 01:47:13,102
Winner, winner, chicken dinner! There it is.

1336
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:16,647
Thank you. God, I love this town.
I love this game.

1337
01:47:17,449 --> 01:47:20,748
And, Jim, I might even love you.

1338
01:47:30,561 --> 01:47:32,757
Hey, you mind if I sit down?

1339
01:47:46,778 --> 01:47:47,836
What's your name?

1340
01:47:47,946 --> 01:47:51,074
Shane? I'm about to change your luck.
It's gonna become mine.

1341
01:47:51,183 --> 01:47:53,413
There you go, give me it all.

1342
01:48:03,461 --> 01:48:04,655
There you go.

1343
01:48:07,433 --> 01:48:09,196
Thank you. Thank you.

1344
01:48:13,939 --> 01:48:16,169
Such a shame, Shane!

1345
01:48:17,142 --> 01:48:19,201
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?

1346
01:48:19,311 --> 01:48:23,646
- Is this your first time, darling?
- I've been winning and losing for hours.

1347
01:48:23,749 --> 01:48:25,842
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

1348
01:48:39,164 --> 01:48:40,689
What the hell kind of streak
are you on, boy?

1349
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,462
This never happens, this never happens.

1350
01:48:56,514 --> 01:48:58,312
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.

1351
01:48:58,417 --> 01:48:59,975
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens!

1352
01:49:00,086 --> 01:49:01,948
- Split tens!
- Again!

1353
01:49:24,877 --> 01:49:27,846
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Give me the chips, Blanca.

1354
01:49:29,081 --> 01:49:30,947
Give me the chips!
Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.

1355
01:49:31,051 --> 01:49:33,952
Come on, just give me the chips!

1356
01:49:34,054 --> 01:49:38,183
- My bus has to leave right away.
- I gotta walk my dog.

1357
01:49:38,291 --> 01:49:40,851
- I'm sorry we're making such a mess.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1358
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,020
Nice to see you. Have a good night, darling.

1359
01:49:49,569 --> 01:49:50,866
This way!

1360
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:03,173
Go.

1361
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:18,895
This way!

1362
01:50:24,805 --> 01:50:26,796
Come on, Jill. Come on!

1363
01:50:36,717 --> 01:50:39,311
Go that way. Throw me the chips.
Come on, we gotta separate.

1364
01:50:39,419 --> 01:50:42,286
Give me the chips, I'll meet you at Fox's.

1365
01:50:48,362 --> 01:50:49,954
Go, go, go, go!

1366
01:51:00,907 --> 01:51:02,568
Come on, come on.

1367
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:07,237
Move, move, move!

1368
01:51:11,418 --> 01:51:12,680
Come on.

1369
01:51:13,821 --> 01:51:15,413
Go, go, this way.

1370
01:51:27,401 --> 01:51:29,232
All right, let's go.

1371
01:51:37,311 --> 01:51:39,802
Go, go, go, go! Airport!

1372
01:51:58,366 --> 01:51:59,993
<i>I never saw Micky Rosa after that.</i>

1373
01:52:05,072 --> 01:52:06,334
Oh, God.

1374
01:52:07,442 --> 01:52:09,706
But I think I wanna see him now.

1375
01:52:10,778 --> 01:52:13,246
And I want you to make that happen.

1376
01:52:17,518 --> 01:52:19,952
I don't work for Micky anymore.

1377
01:52:22,957 --> 01:52:24,390
Come on, kid.

1378
01:52:26,227 --> 01:52:29,993
Your picture's all over the database.
Your Vegas gig is done.

1379
01:52:31,032 --> 01:52:32,966
But I will give you one night.

1380
01:52:33,067 --> 01:52:36,127
And I can guarantee
that you won't be bothered.

1381
01:52:37,038 --> 01:52:40,805
You'll make a killing, and you'll keep it all.

1382
01:52:43,878 --> 01:52:45,072
Listen.

1383
01:52:46,647 --> 01:52:48,114
My name's Cole.

1384
01:52:49,684 --> 01:52:51,208
Cole Williams.

1385
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:55,521
You just bring me Micky Rosa, kid.

1386
01:52:55,824 --> 01:52:57,849
I'll take care of the rest.

1387
01:53:00,395 --> 01:53:03,330
Son of a bitch.

1388
01:53:45,975 --> 01:53:47,737
Who the hell are you?

1389
01:54:10,599 --> 01:54:13,762
Ben. Good job.

1390
01:54:14,836 --> 01:54:19,900
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk
with your professor, and that MIT thing?

1391
01:54:20,109 --> 01:54:22,202
It's gonna work out for you.

1392
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:25,338
So that's it?

1393
01:54:26,783 --> 01:54:29,546
- That's it.
- All right.

1394
01:54:30,519 --> 01:54:32,214
Oh, Dr. Campbell?

1395
01:54:33,555 --> 01:54:36,525
They don't have pensions
in my line of work.

1396
01:54:36,859 --> 01:54:38,759
And the software does
what it's supposed to do.

1397
01:54:38,861 --> 01:54:42,763
And I been chasing Micky Rosa around here
for too damn long.

1398
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,264
I'm looking at some retirement.

1399
01:54:48,171 --> 01:54:49,638
Leave the bag.

1400
01:54:51,707 --> 01:54:54,006
No. No, no, no, no.

1401
01:54:54,110 --> 01:54:58,604
I need this money. You have no idea
what I went through to get this money.

1402
01:54:58,715 --> 01:55:03,709
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out
how to get everything you want in this life,

1403
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:05,549
'cause you're smart.

1404
01:55:07,123 --> 01:55:11,651
So, you're gonna leave the bag.

1405
01:55:16,699 --> 01:55:21,295
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag.
It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.

1406
01:55:30,147 --> 01:55:31,944
I knew you were smart.

1407
01:55:50,801 --> 01:55:53,530
<i>I had a 1590 on my SAT.</i>

1408
01:55:53,636 --> 01:55:55,695
<i>I got a 44 on my MCATs.</i>

1409
01:55:56,205 --> 01:55:59,333
<i>And I have a 4.0 GPA from MIT.</i>

1410
01:55:59,442 --> 01:56:01,911
<i>I thought I had my life mapped out.</i>

1411
01:56:03,814 --> 01:56:04,906
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1412
01:56:05,015 --> 01:56:08,473
<i>what my Nonlinear Equations professor
once told me,</i>

1413
01:56:09,019 --> 01:56:12,250
<i>"Always account for variable change."</i>

1414
01:56:14,058 --> 01:56:15,581
Hello, Micky.

1415
01:56:17,293 --> 01:56:19,125
Look, I got money in Boston.
A hundred grand.

1416
01:56:19,229 --> 01:56:21,254
I'll give it to you.
Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.

1417
01:56:21,365 --> 01:56:24,425
I don't want your money, Micky.
I don't need it.

1418
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:33,038
But I know someone
who might be interested.

1419
01:56:33,410 --> 01:56:37,506
He's good with numbers, too.
He works for the IRS.

1420
01:56:46,323 --> 01:56:48,382
<i>I let down my good friends.</i>

1421
01:56:49,059 --> 01:56:53,997
<i>But as it turns out,
they weren't too bad at simple math either.</i>

1422
01:57:19,823 --> 01:57:22,383
<i>I scored the prettiest girl in school.</i>

1423
01:57:25,863 --> 01:57:28,492
<i>I got beaten down
by an old-school Vegas thug</i>

1424
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:31,797
<i>who was having trouble
accepting his retirement.</i>

1425
01:57:33,104 --> 01:57:36,870
<i>But I worked out a deal with him
that got him a nice pension.</i>

1426
01:57:40,244 --> 01:57:43,042
<i>And I lied to my mother.</i>

1427
01:57:43,515 --> 01:57:47,212
<i>But I confessed the lie,
and, well, she still loved me.</i>

1428
01:58:03,735 --> 01:58:07,000
<i>So my senior year of college,
I joined this team.</i>

1429
01:58:07,405 --> 01:58:09,566
<i>And I learned this new skill.</i>

1430
01:58:09,808 --> 01:58:12,834
<i>I went to Vegas 17 times to use it.</i>

1431
01:58:15,013 --> 01:58:18,541
<i>I made hundreds of thousands of dollars
counting cards.</i>

1432
01:58:19,585 --> 01:58:22,144
And then I had it all stolen from me.

1433
01:58:23,087 --> 01:58:24,247
Twice.

1434
01:58:25,557 --> 01:58:29,653
How's that for life experience, professor?
Did I dazzle you?

1435
01:58:30,829 --> 01:58:33,667
Did I jump off the page?
