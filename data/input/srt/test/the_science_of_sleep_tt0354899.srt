00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,262
Hi, and welcome back to
another episode of Television Educative.

2
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,032
Tonight, I will show you
how dreams are prepared.

3
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,540
People think it's a very simple
and easy process...

4
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,941
...but it's a bit more
complicated than that.

5
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:28,018
As you can see, a very delicate combination
of complex ingredients is the key.

6
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:32,122
First, we put in some random thoughts.

7
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:39,460
And then we add a little bit
of reminiscences of the day...

8
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:44,428
...mixed with some memories
from the past.

9
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:46,397
That's for two people.

10
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:51,967
Love, friendships, relationships,
and all those "ships"...

11
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,742
...together with songs you heard
during the day...

12
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:58,713
...things you saw and also... personal.

13
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:01,944
Okay. Okay, I think it's one.

14
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,318
There it goes. Yes. Yes.

15
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,651
Okay, we have to run.

16
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,690
I'm talking quietly to not
wake myself up.

17
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,656
I'm with my dad.

18
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:22,638
Yes, Dad. I remember.
My father was there.

19
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,867
It's nice to see him healthy
and normal again.

20
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:28,444
I almost forgot how he looked.

21
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:30,376
Handsome, no?

22
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:32,914
Oh, yeah, oh yeah, we're in a concert.

23
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:36,986
A Duke Ellington concert.
Yes, my man, Duke Ellington.

24
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:40,851
And the band starts to play.
Bass, drums and all.

25
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:43,494
It's amazing, they got this super swing.

26
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:45,459
And the Duke enters the stage.

27
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,464
He's radiant, in a glowing white tuxedo.

28
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:51,766
The Duke!

29
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:55,090
Last time was at the Olympia in 1958.

30
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:58,213
Thanks for the invitation.

31
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:01,626
But what is this?

32
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:05,822
This is not Duke Ellington.
It's Duke Ellington!

33
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:12,047
Dad, this is not Duke Ellington,
but Duck Ellington.

34
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:13,850
This is a dream.

35
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:14,851
What?

36
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:19,990
I'm sorry, Dad, but you're dead.

37
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,656
You've lost the battle to cancer.

38
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,962
No, no. I cried so hard.

39
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:30,597
I could feel my tears forming
two rivers under my eyes.

40
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:34,040
In dreams, emotions are overwhelming.

41
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:42,967
Here

42
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:43,968
Here's good.

43
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:23,802
Calm down!
You'll knock my door down! what?

44
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,130
Mrs.Miroux

45
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,913
No, she's not here.

46
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:27,914
But I ...

47
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,858
That door won’t last!

48
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:31,859
I ...Stephane...

49
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:36,142
Stephane, is it u?

50
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,143
Ivana?

51
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,985
You're back!

52
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:41,908
Let me look at u

53
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:45,420
Oh, those eyes!
You're almost a man now.

54
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:47,245
I will help. Your keys...

55
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:49,383
Your poor father...

56
00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:52,901
I hope we will see more of your mother now

57
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:55,777
See? Nothing's changed.

58
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,062
There we are.

59
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:01,075
Do you recognize it?

60
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:04,603
I am glad the place will be lived in

61
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:07,808
There's a message

62
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,432
You mom should see to the mail

63
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,535
Sorry I could not pick you up
Gerard was sick all night

64
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:21,759
Here's the address for your job tomorrow

65
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,258
At 10:00 AM, see Mr. Pouchet.

66
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,757
at the Latreille company

67
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,272
They're a good firm

68
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,212
30 Rue de Marseille at Republique

69
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,879
I can't wait to see u

70
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,024
What's the job?

71
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:39,923
- Illustrations
- For calendars?

72
00:05:40,797 --> 00:05:42,545
Yes. Wanna see?

73
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:44,965
No time.
I have the stairs to clean.

74
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:46,904
I'll leave you to it. bye

75
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:49,354
Goodbye.Thanks

76
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:52,702
Oh, I can't believe you're back!

77
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:26,282
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

78
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:04,560
Stephane, it's ur first day here.
You gotta choose sides.

79
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:07,859
So, two possibilities: a couple of fags.

80
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:11,549
How can we be gay if we're opposite sexes?

81
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,742
A matter of mentality

82
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:18,847
I'm Guy, ex-battleship salesman,
filmsetter and ladykiller.

83
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,954
I'll show you the ropes.

84
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,105
I can do that, too

85
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:30,576
I'm Martine. I'm in change
of the very popular ski weekend.

86
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:32,932
Serge, Martine's assistant.

87
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:37,757
The ski weekend is excellent for team spirit...

88
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,544
Ski?

89
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,292
No, sorry...

90
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:47,036
Ski to me...No, thanks

91
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:54,502
It's boring, but it's easy

92
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:57,176
The calendar has two parts.

93
00:08:57,177 --> 00:09:00,288
The bottom: the months and nude girls

94
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:05,383
- Slowly
- A redhead with a big bush.

95
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:10,015
We don't do this part.
we do the boring bit:

96
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:14,804
the name of the cretin
who sends out this crappy calendar.

97
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:20,829
So..when you get a file, you open it.

98
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:25,458
This text comes from the typesetting machine.

99
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:26,459
Typesetting?

100
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,906
This revolting machine is the typesetter.

101
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:30,907
This glue...

102
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:45,051
My mother told me...She said...

103
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,484
that my job is...

104
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,851
Do you speak Spanish?

105
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:54,840
No, hombre.
No parla todo espagnolito at all.

106
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:56,723
- English very well.
- Oh, good, good.

107
00:09:56,894 --> 00:10:00,057
- Yes, picture one is a duck.
- Me too.

108
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,626
Am I not supposed to design
the new calendar collection?

109
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:07,862
No, no, I'm afraid not.

110
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:09,863
Fuck, an artist! He won't last.

111
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,566
Because my mother,
she told me this was a creative job.

112
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,336
This doesn't look creative at all.

113
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:15,337
Yeah, but no.

114
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,975
You know,
I think there's a misunderstanding.

115
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:19,411
Can I see?

116
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,017
- Sure.
- Yeah?

117
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:30,850
This is nice.

118
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:33,394
Yeah, not bad, eh?

119
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:34,997
I'll tell you what.

120
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,226
Take the portfolio and
let's talk to the big boss here, okay?

121
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:39,227
It sucks.

122
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,160
The collection is crap anyway.

123
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,502
Welcome in this palace, Stephane.

124
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,905
Stephane is a great artist
with a foreign accent.

125
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,511
He'd like to suggest something.

126
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,012
What about the ski weekend?
Did you put him on the list?

127
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:56,210
You see, Stephane, it's very, very important
to stimulate the team spirit.

128
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:58,287
Martine.

129
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:06,423
You should show him your work, okay?
Be brave, Stephane.

130
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:07,424
- Beat it!
- Screw you!

131
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,200
Well, it's still a bit of a work in progress.

132
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:14,361
I've done 12 paintings for a calendar.

133
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:21,101
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

134
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,706
We will be reaching Paris' Charles de Gaulle
in 6 hours and 45 minutes.

135
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:28,283
Please enjoy the flight,
fasten your seat belts...

136
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:32,253
...and if you have any questions,
please don't hesitate to:

137
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:37,184
The pilot will never finish the sentence.

138
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:41,826
Flight 800, on July 17th, 1996...

139
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,194
...disappears from the sky.

140
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:47,804
Spraying its 230 passengers
all over the North Atlantic.

141
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:50,804
The whole world is in shock.

142
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,870
Mexico City, September

143
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,975
Quiet morning,
like any other morning.

144
00:11:56,647 --> 00:12:00,344
A huge earthquake
rattles the center of the town.

145
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:05,546
Each month has its own
most infamous disaster event...

146
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,748
...engraved in the collective memory.

147
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:12,225
It's a concept I've been trying to
work on and developing.

148
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:13,829
It's called disasterology.

149
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:16,057
Stephane, you are not serious.

150
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,395
Oh, I am very serious.

151
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:21,470
It's the customer that needs
a little bit of a sense of humor.

152
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,699
My customers don't have
any sense of humor.

153
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Disasterology!

154
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:30,273
They want puppies, trucks,
flowers or nudes. That's all.

155
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,906
Come on, Guy, show him his work.
It's getting late now.

156
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:36,508
Look at yourself.
It ain't pampas here!

157
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,985
Come on, Stephane, let's go.

158
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:44,104
You shave with toast?

159
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:45,105
what's "shave toast"?

160
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,758
You shave with a cracker?

161
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:07,476
Oh, you little asshole!

162
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:02,604
Sorry, no. No, no, no.
I need a break. No, no, no.

163
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,708
No, no, I need a little break.
Serge, I need a little break.

164
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:07,036
Guy, just a tiny one.

165
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:21,487
La pampa is in Argentina, you idiot!

166
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,757
What about Yucatan, Palenque, Kerala?

167
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:49,180
Get out.

168
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:55,141
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

169
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:59,386
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

170
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:02,958
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

171
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:06,619
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

172
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:09,789
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

173
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,928
Come in, action two.
Can you complete the mission?

174
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,368
It's 7:30.

175
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,303
Hello?

176
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:24,199
you ok, honey?
How was yesterday?

177
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:26,308
Are you trying to mock me on the air?

178
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:28,418
A creative job,
Is that what you call it?

179
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:32,007
- Did it go badly?
- My job is shit! A piece of shit!

180
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:35,878
Mom... I glue paper in a basement all day!

181
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,879
Your paintings...

182
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,872
They don't need a graphic designer.

183
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,980
But Pouchet said...

184
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:45,047
No, not true! Not true!

185
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:46,869
You lied to get me back here.

186
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,240
I won't stay another day!

187
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,403
That's not nice.
Come see us on Wednesday.

188
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:53,804
Big hugs, darling

189
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:56,370
No, Mam... Mama. Mama!

190
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,718
See how cute you were.

191
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,920
Excuse me for this interruption.

192
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,727
Yeah, that's my father.

193
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,059
oh, shit!

194
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,945
What're you doing?

195
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:48,946
I've gone through.

196
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:52,781
The mezzanine goes on this wall.

197
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:56,285
No. head pointing north.
It's feng shui.

198
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:57,286
Isn't that north?

199
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:00,649
And the door?
You come in, hit a beam...

200
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,934
None of your sushi crap.
You're a danger with a drill.

201
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:13,116
P.S. R:

202
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,626
Parallel synchronized randomness.

203
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:24,828
An interesting brain rarity
and our subject for today.

204
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:30,629
Two people walk in opposite directions
at the same time...

205
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:34,801
...and then they make the same decision
at the same time.

206
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,413
Then they correct it,
and then they correct it...

207
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:40,709
...and then they correct it
and then they correct it...

208
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,183
Basically, in a mathematical world...

209
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:46,448
...these two little guys will
stay looped for the end of time.

210
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:49,457
The brain is the most complex thing
in the universe...

211
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,652
...and it's right behind the nose.

212
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,227
Fascinating!

213
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:59,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about this.

214
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,067
Stay calm.

215
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:05,937
I think that's just that they are
renovating the studio right behind here.

216
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:16,220
Wait! My back!
I'm carrying all the weight.

217
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,758
Is your end heavier?

218
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,169
Yeah, the deep notes are always heavier.

219
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:31,150
My end's heavier.

220
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:34,260
OK? You got it or not?

221
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:35,261
Thanks, mister.

222
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:49,647
Jeez!

223
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,899
Who's that guy you brought?

224
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:56,223
You OK?

225
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:58,027
You hurt yourself?

226
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:04,184
Look at the mess you made!

227
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:07,300
You're not professionals!
I don't believe it!

228
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:08,301
Doer it hurt now?

229
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,681
- OK, and here?
- Yes, a little.

230
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:18,743
No, I don't have...
much lucky in the current.

231
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:19,744
What?

232
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:22,700
That...I...

233
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:25,827
No...my French is pathetic.

234
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,891
- You are Spanish, no?
- No.

235
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:30,492
- No?
- I'm from Mexico.

236
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:32,288
But my mother is French.

237
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:36,832
Yeah, I just came here because
my father died of cancer.

238
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:43,699
Okay. You know,
that looks pretty bad.

239
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,258
Got some cream, Stephanie?

240
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:47,259
- Maybe over there.
- I'll get it

241
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,539
You think I have to go
to the hospital?

242
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:53,205
Because it's not looking that good...

243
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,263
Thanks for the hole.
My asshole landlady's next door.

244
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:58,264
Screw her!

245
00:20:58,265 --> 00:20:59,265
What's that? No!

246
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:02,441
- It's good.
- Very funny!

247
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:05,122
Good stuff for you.

248
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:09,556
Okay?

249
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:14,833
- It's strong.
- It's mint. It's mint.

250
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,943
- Yeah, I feel it working already.
- Yeah? Okay.

251
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:20,944
There

252
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:25,414
- So, what's your name?
- Stephane.

253
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:28,050
Stephane? Stephanie.

254
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:30,517
Stephane, Stephanie.
Stephanie, Stephane.

255
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:33,520
Click-clack, catch, match.
She has no boyfriend.

256
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:34,521
That's enough!

257
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:39,054
- And you? You...?
- Zo?

258
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:42,256
You know,
Stephanie is a talented composer.

259
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:45,891
- You should hear what she makes.
- That's bullshit. I never play it.

260
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,597
You know, a pretty girl with talent,
that deserves to be mentioned.

261
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:51,297
Yeah.

262
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:53,204
And what's your job?

263
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:56,972
I'm a promotional calendar
maquettiste. Yeah, it's...

264
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:59,972
You're pretty cool for...

265
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:08,631
It's better parked.

266
00:22:08,632 --> 00:22:10,740
- OK?
- We'll see.

267
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,756
Forget C major.E's busted.

268
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:21,005
I'll try minor.It's sadder.

269
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,898
Major chords won't work.

270
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:26,741
That's typical from Sylvain.

271
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,019
Congratulations, great!

272
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:32,144
Quiet, he's hurt.

273
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:33,145
Oh, yeah

274
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:36,515
He asks you to help and then
he lets you do all the work.

275
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,655
I am sorry.

276
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,533
- Let's go
- use the brake next time

277
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:42,534
Bye

278
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:49,331
So what does it mean exactly,
promotional calendar maquettist?

279
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,096
Maquettiste. It's...
I don't know.

280
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:58,635
- Well, that handy!
- I don't know. It's really boring, actually.

281
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:01,710
But I mean, there's one profession
I really wanna pursue...

282
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:03,369
...which is inventor.

283
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:06,448
- Inventing what?
- Well, I can show you.

284
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:09,313
I have some glasses...

285
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:11,920
...where you can see real life in 3-D.

286
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,284
Isn't life already in 3-D?

287
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:17,216
No... Yeah, but...

288
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:20,591
Come on, I mean,
Do you wanna... Do you wanna try it?

289
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:23,166
This, for example:

290
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,564
Look, look, look.

291
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:31,230
- It works, no?
- Yeah, yeah.

292
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:32,906
Look, it's funny.

293
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:40,212
You know Pulfrich, the guy who
discovered the 3-D effect?

294
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:41,874
He had only one eye.

295
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:45,146
And that makes him, like, the Beethoven
of the stereo, you know?

296
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,253
And what do you girls do?
Are you students or work?

297
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:54,056
- No, we're...
- No, we're creative executives.

298
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:57,997
We're going to concerts
and we find bands to sign.

299
00:23:58,168 --> 00:23:59,192
To sign what?

300
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,360
Oh, she means that we're working
in music.

301
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:03,673
What company?

302
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:06,233
Aristotle.

303
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:08,904
Like, as the turtle, no?

304
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,547
No, no, no.
Like the philosopher. You know?

305
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:13,808
Stop it! It's not funny.

306
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:14,809
He doesn't understand.

307
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,779
Don't make fun of people in my home.

308
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,318
I'm gonna go.

309
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:25,006
Thanks a lot for the hand.

310
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,379
And sorry for the piano.

311
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:32,529
How do you know Sylvain?

312
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,032
- Sylvain?
- Yeah.

313
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:38,868
- From Mexico. Yeah.
- Oh, Mexico.

314
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,805
He never said anything about it.

315
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:43,538
No? I don't know why. Bye-bye.

316
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:46,877
- You want us to drive you back?
- No, I'm okay.

317
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,614
With your stupid lies,

318
00:24:52,615 --> 00:24:54,964
we look like two dumb bitches.

319
00:24:54,965 --> 00:24:57,776
It's be cool to be an art director.

320
00:24:57,777 --> 00:25:00,244
We'd get into gigs free and get paid, too.

321
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:04,547
Gig are boring.
You put me to shame.

322
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:05,548
What?

323
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:11,707
To screw. Maybe yes, maybe no.

324
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:15,038
Maybe rain, maybe snow.

325
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,736
Okay, baby.

326
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:19,171
Let's go to Momo's as usual.

327
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:21,007
- what do you weigh
- 110 lbs

328
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:22,008
Come here

329
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:24,687
Don't start again, guy!

330
00:25:26,055 --> 00:25:27,357
Don't screw around.

331
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,750
It's three times this week
he puts his ass on the poubelle.

332
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:30,751
Come on, it's on me

333
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:32,941
Who are the fags?

334
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:34,941
- We're not gonna wait for them?
- No, no, no.

335
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,287
Hold his hand, too.

336
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:39,438
And you just watch!

337
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:43,332
Next time I'll leave you in the trash, weakling!

338
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,333
- Momo's, then?
- No, I'll eat alone

339
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:51,874
I can't believe that my mother lied
about the job just to get me over here.

340
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:55,410
It's completely unethical to do that
to your own son. It's horrible.

341
00:25:55,585 --> 00:25:58,486
It's the worst job I've ever had
in my life.

342
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:02,247
Your predecessor...

343
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:05,190
He committed suicide
two weeks ago.

344
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:07,121
No.

345
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:09,955
No. I'm joking.

346
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:13,459
No, he left after two weeks.

347
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:18,339
Come on, man, just get along with
the job and we'll have some fun.

348
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:23,512
Do you think Martine is pretty?

349
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:25,641
Martine? From work?

350
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:28,717
No, Martin Scorsese. Yeah.

351
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:32,282
I don't... I don't think about that.

352
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:34,048
Well, imagine...

353
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:37,284
...if she comes and gives you a blowjob
in the darkroom...

354
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:39,224
You know, I can arrange this for you.

355
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:43,662
So getting laid is all that matters?
It doesn't matter who the person is?

356
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:47,270
You see, I'm not a creative person,
like you.

357
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:51,535
I don't feel the need to leave a trace
behind me...

358
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:55,469
...except a fart sometimes.

359
00:26:56,246 --> 00:27:00,546
Sorry. It escaped me. Come on.

360
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:03,277
You know, the other day, I saw
an old man on the bench.

361
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:05,387
He was smiling, you know, really happy.

362
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:07,523
You know what he was thinking of?

363
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:08,918
His grandchildren?

364
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:11,925
Not at all.
If you don't know, don't improvise.

365
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:15,121
No, he was thinking about all the dirty
stuff and naughty stuff...

366
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:17,266
...he did with the girls
when he was young.

367
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:20,301
How do you know that?
Did you ask him?

368
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,967
I know that because...

369
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:26,769
...this man was me in the future.
And I was happy.

370
00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:29,434
I simply want to be like him
in my old days.

371
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:33,176
You know, I have this neighbor
that has a friend...

372
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,045
...that is very pretty, actually.

373
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,709
Oh, good reason to stay, my man.

374
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:40,880
Be careful, you know,
with the whole neighbor situation.

375
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:44,185
That's the problem, that I think
it's the neighbor that likes me...

376
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:45,521
...not her friend.

377
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,060
- Yeah.
- Danger.

378
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,595
I never get the one I like, anyways.

379
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:54,600
Maybe she's a good cook.

380
00:27:59,776 --> 00:28:03,371
- Stephane? Did you forget something?
- Hey. Hi.

381
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:07,813
No, no. I was just... I was just...

382
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:10,714
You know, my hand? Because I can...

383
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:14,254
Are you looking for Zo?
She's not here.

384
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:17,791
- She doesn't live here, you know?
- Oh, okay.

385
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:20,589
How's your dad...? Your hand.

386
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:23,391
My dad? My dad's still dead.

387
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:24,591
I'm sorry.

388
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:26,476
God, I'm so dumb.

389
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:29,798
You want Zo? s number?

390
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:33,272
No. No, I think I'm fine.

391
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:37,244
- So I guess I'll be on my way now.
- Okay.

392
00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:38,813
Bye.

393
00:28:43,553 --> 00:28:46,750
I'll do my laundry later. Maybe I should
check this hand of yours.

394
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:52,327
Okay, well, yeah,
it's better to be safe than sorry.

395
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:54,916
Prevention's better than cure.

396
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:58,242
A bird in the hand...
...is worth my bush!

397
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:00,702
Sorry, it's not funny.

398
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,169
I think it's funny.
I mean, it's not that funny...

399
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,638
I mean, it's not funny,
but I find it funny.

400
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:09,976
Come in.

401
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:16,479
It's still chaos.

402
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:23,387
I'm going to put my bed up there,
to save some space.

403
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,256
How do you call it? A "mezzanine"?

404
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:28,920
Mezzanine, oui, mezzanine.

405
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,996
Do you make those?

406
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,037
Some I made and others I adopted.

407
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:38,868
You have to find who.

408
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:43,912
- You made this one.
- Nope.

409
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,011
What's his name?

410
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,510
His name is...

411
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:51,482
...Golden the Pony Boy.

412
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:56,615
When I found him, he was so sad
that I had to buy him for a lot.

413
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:59,920
- He's never going to leave me now.
- Really?

414
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:01,893
I understand that you're the mother...

415
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:04,363
...but you also have to think
of his interest.

416
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:06,832
Yeah, it's possible.
But he is already damaged.

417
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:09,335
I can't take any chances.

418
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:10,996
Let me see your hand.

419
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:17,680
You know, it started to smell like a foot.

420
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:21,240
It's a good sign.

421
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,782
Can you move it?

422
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:34,324
Yeah. Well, it hurts a little bit,
but it's okay.

423
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:38,534
- I have too big hands.
- Yeah?

424
00:30:38,702 --> 00:30:40,567
That means you have a large penis.

425
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:44,432
I'm sorry, that was a bit inappropriate.

426
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:47,600
Look, I'll show you a trick.
It's a brain effect.

427
00:30:47,777 --> 00:30:50,143
You have to... You have to do this:

428
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:52,606
Okay.

429
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:59,115
It feels so weird. It feels like if it
wasn't my hand.

430
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:03,224
I know one that you have to...

431
00:31:03,393 --> 00:31:05,384
You have to put your two fingers
like this:

432
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:07,792
...and then you look into the distance,
like that:

433
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:10,524
- All you can see is a little...
- A little sausage, yeah.

434
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,224
I know it. It's a good one.

435
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:14,336
Oh, you know it?

436
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,375
I made this boat in fabric.

437
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:27,312
I have to put it
in a small forest as a setup.

438
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:31,413
The boat is looking for its mer,
which is...

439
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:35,149
It sounds like both "mother"
and "sea" in French.

440
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:37,793
So the forest inside the boat?

441
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,794
That's genius.
That's like a vegetable Noah's Arc.

442
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:44,365
No, no, no, the boat is in the forest,
looking for his mer.

443
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:47,469
But I need to make the trees, though.

444
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:50,231
Okay, but you know, the forest
inside the boat...

445
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:52,136
...that's a really good idea.

446
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:54,503
I think that maybe
you wanna do that instead.

447
00:31:55,445 --> 00:31:59,176
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll do it.
It sounds like a good idea.

448
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:01,476
Okay, so I'll go get my dad's
old camera...

449
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:04,814
...and we can make an animated film
of the forest inside the boat...

450
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:07,115
...looking for its mother.

451
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,316
And the leaves grow and the wind
catches in them...

452
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:13,223
...then the boat takes off.
You'll make the sea, okay?

453
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:18,663
Okay, yeah. Well, we can do it with
layers of paper, like this:

454
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:22,905
You know, like this and they move
in opposite directions, you know?

455
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:29,601
Yeah. Yeah, but we have to find
something more special then.

456
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:33,509
Kind of retarded in a way.
Look.

457
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:42,088
- Cellophane.
- Cellophane.

458
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:44,385
Yeah. Yeah, like a Russian
animated film.

459
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:47,962
My mother, she collects thousands
of bonbon wrapping paper...

460
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:51,259
...and also cardboard tubes.
We've got boxes full of them at home.

461
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:52,799
What for?

462
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:55,904
She used to do this arts and crafts
thing and other projects...

463
00:32:56,072 --> 00:32:57,664
...but she never finished them.

464
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:00,401
I actually can't stand it,
she never finishes anything.

465
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:04,308
- And look, for the clouds.
- Oh, yeah.

466
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:08,081
Oh, no, no, no. No, try it again.
Try it again, wrong chord.

467
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:11,787
No, wrong chord, try it again.

468
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:16,551
I knew it. I knew it!

469
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:19,786
Each structure has its own resonant
frequency.

470
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:23,057
You just have to hit the right chord
at the right time.

471
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:26,168
Okay, I'll go get the camera
and you go do the forest.

472
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:29,396
Whoa, whoa, whoa, by the time
you get back, I'll be sleeping.

473
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:31,767
And I need to finish the boat, anyway.

474
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:35,035
You bring the camera next time, okay?

475
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:40,273
Okay. Well, you tell me when to bring
the camera, okay?

476
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:44,049
Well, I'm leaving.

477
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,313
I'll start the forest tomorrow.

478
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:47,786
All right.

479
00:33:47,787 --> 00:33:48,787
Thanks

480
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:51,491
Bye.

481
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:03,538
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

482
00:35:00,763 --> 00:35:03,891
No, no, Martine.
Martine, no. No, no.

483
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:05,898
I'm sorry, I can't.

484
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:08,469
It's... It's not you, it's me.
I feel guilty.

485
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:10,469
What is it, Stephanou?

486
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,632
I can't live all my life
hiding in my apartment.

487
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,801
- I need to come clean.
- You are clean.

488
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:19,938
Aristurtle? Okay, okay.
Type this:

489
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:21,378
Dear Stephanie:

490
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:24,520
- "Dear Steph..." Who is she?
- I am...

491
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:27,315
Forget about it, I need to write it
in French anyway.

492
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,980
Okay.

493
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:33,582
Iway ouldshay...

494
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:38,209
Iway ouldshay say...dear neighbor...

495
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,074
Yes, yo read it good...

496
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:43,368
I have lady next door...

497
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:49,137
I'm too confused in fact
with my hand accidented on the piano.

498
00:35:49,138 --> 00:35:52,898
and lied you ... feel myself guilty.

499
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:55,409
I want confess.

500
00:35:56,252 --> 00:35:59,949
By the way, do you have Zo? s
phone number?

501
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:04,025
Thanks, Stephane.

502
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:07,226
Where are you going now?

503
00:36:09,265 --> 00:36:11,563
Stephanou?

504
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,255
No, no, no.

505
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:04,352
I'm too confuse in fact
with my hand accidented...

506
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,246
"Do you have Zo? s phone number?"

507
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:07,247
Holy fuck!

508
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:11,484
Dear Stephanie, comma.

509
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:15,153
I am just your neighbor,
there is nothing more to say than that.

510
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:18,865
This is the reason why I am writing
a letter to you...

511
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:23,904
...because I feel really bad inside
my stomach.

512
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:25,665
It's a mix between...

513
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:28,504
I don't know if what I feel is a bit
of nostalgia...

514
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:31,545
...or wanting to go to the bathroom.

515
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:35,172
I am just a new liar in your life.

516
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:39,788
A new liar that has come
and destroyed your piano...

517
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:43,687
...and maybe by doing that destroy
the huge heritage...

518
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,421
I want us to start a new start
and a new...

519
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:51,124
A new blank page of friendship.

520
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,202
And if you can embrace that the same
way I am embracing it right now...

521
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:58,238
...that I am feeling it right now,
I see the possibilities...

522
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:03,402
...once we go above that threshold
of life...

523
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:06,605
...and matters that succumb
and become trickling down...

524
00:38:06,783 --> 00:38:10,048
...into this little pond
that is called life.

525
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:12,847
Full stop. The end.

526
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:22,757
2:37 PM As of this afternoon,

527
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,630
late is the same as absent.

528
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:28,586
We must tell Pouchet.Right, Guy?

529
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:39,071
Mistakes shouldn't go unpunished.

530
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:46,710
Why do my armpits smell like sperm?
Very strange.

531
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:47,711
What do you think?

532
00:38:53,712 --> 00:38:55,824
Guy's making me smell the sperm!

533
00:38:58,839 --> 00:38:59,973
Excuse me.

534
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:03,749
Guy...

535
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,533
What makes you think you can do that?

536
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:09,898
No on else can work this shitty machine!

537
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:11,899
And... Stephane?

538
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:17,732
OK...

539
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:42,825
Stephanie

540
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:50,819
Stephanie?

541
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:55,150
Stephanie?

542
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:00,826
- Stephanie.
- Stephanie.

543
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,452
Stephanie and Zo? lied to me.

544
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:28,021
They are not
creative executives. No! No.

545
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:30,182
Aristotle, my ass.

546
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,792
They think I'm stupid, but no.

547
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:33,986
You guys are gonna
help me find them, okay?

548
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:34,987
- Martine...
- Yes?

549
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:38,390
- Stephane needs you.
- Okay.

550
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:40,661
- We've gotta find a way of...
- Go back to work.

551
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:42,497
Oh, no. To work? No, no, no.

552
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:45,334
It's only a dream.
We don't have to work in dreams.

553
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:49,035
- No! Nothing is for real.
- You write, you write.

554
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:50,941
- You write!
- You're just the result...

555
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:53,513
...of a chemical flux in my brain,
that's all.

556
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:56,146
Do you mean we don't really exist?

557
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:57,911
Flux?

558
00:40:57,912 --> 00:41:01,779
Start again.You've lost me.

559
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,549
Well, I was sleeping,
dreaming of a praying mantis.

560
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:13,700
fighting with a turtle, but the turtle
had a silver shell,

561
00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:16,701
like a CD but in a hump, a shell.

562
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:19,388
And they fought over an elephant...

563
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:21,806
Not that. Tell the next part.

564
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:24,462
So, I wake up, because...

565
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:29,666
I hear a freaky sound at the front door.

566
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:32,456
I turn on the light.

567
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,396
This is my favorite bit.

568
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:37,397
Stephane who twisted his hand

569
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:39,810
is butt-naked in the hall.

570
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:44,047
Stephane who helped you move is is your neighbor.

571
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:46,048
My landlady's son

572
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:52,241
But tell me...Remember the letter.
What did it say?

573
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:55,242
I told you, it was gobbledygook.
It went...

574
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:58,243
I'm your neighbor, a liar, blah blah...

575
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:01,812
By the way,
do you have Zo? s number?

576
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:03,813
what did he mean?

577
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:04,814
What do you think?

578
00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:10,741
Neighbor, you're swell, but your friend rings my bell.

579
00:42:10,742 --> 00:42:11,742
No way!

580
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,003
Why doesn't he know
you know he's your neighbor?

581
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,004
He doesn't know I read it.

582
00:42:19,005 --> 00:42:21,005
Straight after, Cap'n Hook got it back.

583
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:23,706
A change of heart.

584
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:24,707
Holy fuck!

585
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,708
But why did he lie about his address?

586
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,709
Why did you lie about the job?

587
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:36,002
Look, I'll give him your number-
you ask him.

588
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:38,319
I've got a guy, remember?

589
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
You tease others.

590
00:42:42,038 --> 00:42:43,321
How dare you say that!

591
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:47,322
I'm no prick-tease!
You take that back!

592
00:42:48,554 --> 00:42:50,423
If you cannot stop fighting, don't be friends.

593
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:55,192
Stephanie, stock taking.

594
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:58,193
We're exchanging ideas, not fighting.

595
00:42:58,194 --> 00:42:59,194
Big difference.

596
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:04,505
So, Miroux, Ornano...
Miroux, Caulaincourt...

597
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:06,795
Miroux, Rue Labat. Bingo!

598
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,105
It's ringing

599
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,348
Go on, take it!

600
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:24,349
take it!

601
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,926
Hello?

602
00:43:26,135 --> 00:43:27,295
Hello?

603
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,562
Stephane Miroux?

604
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:32,340
- Stephanie?
- Yes.

605
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:33,907
Hey.

606
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:37,802
Did you finish the boat already?

607
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:41,612
No, no, of course not.

608
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:44,344
I still have some stuff to buy.

609
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:46,293
In French, it's more fun!

610
00:43:46,294 --> 00:43:52,395
I'm with zoe and we were wondering

611
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,712
if you had any other optical illusions.

612
00:43:55,713 --> 00:43:58,307
Op-ticklish illusions?

613
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:01,698
Optical tricks.

614
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,464
Yeah.

615
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:11,272
Yeah, I could show you one.
I got this really cool one. When?

616
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,273
Now!

617
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:15,473
Now?

618
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:17,717
Okay.

619
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:23,147
It'll take me, like,
35 minutes to get there.

620
00:44:23,148 --> 00:44:25,148
He's got nerve!

621
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:29,394
Maybe... I mean,
maybe I can make it in 15.

622
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:31,897
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah?

623
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,001
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

624
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:36,978
It matches your green eyes.

625
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:37,979
Bullshit!

626
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:42,374
You can't wear the same jeans for ages!

627
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,971
- I'll look ridiculous.
- No!

628
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:04,357
He's going down.
What a dumb-ass!

629
00:45:19,982 --> 00:45:21,449
- Hi.
- Hi.

630
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:23,642
- You were quick.
- Yeah.

631
00:45:24,787 --> 00:45:26,516
I brought you this.

632
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:30,090
So basically, with cards, what we do,
I mean, because...

633
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:33,888
...it's kind of difficult. The cards
are there. The cards do not lie, you know.

634
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:35,792
It cannot change.

635
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:39,230
So if you grab the cards
and you open them...

636
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:42,802
...and you name one card
and I point at it from a distance, okay?

637
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:45,941
But remember to send it to me, you know,
before you name it.

638
00:45:46,108 --> 00:45:49,373
Send it to me, name it, send, name,
send, name, send.

639
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,911
- Okay.
- Send it.

640
00:45:55,726 --> 00:45:57,051
Eight of hearts

641
00:45:57,052 --> 00:46:00,283
Okay. Yeah, I received it. It's there.

642
00:46:00,456 --> 00:46:01,923
Yup.

643
00:46:03,158 --> 00:46:06,059
- You saw that? Did you see that?
- It's amazing.

644
00:46:06,228 --> 00:46:07,661
Try another one.

645
00:46:09,698 --> 00:46:12,724
Ace of spades is there.

646
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:16,027
Yeah.

647
00:46:28,092 --> 00:46:29,689
Hey, bottoms up!

648
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,082
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

649
00:46:32,254 --> 00:46:34,279
- What?
- What are you doing dressed like that?

650
00:46:34,456 --> 00:46:36,151
It's punk.

651
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,027
Who is this guy?

652
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:39,876
Zoe?

653
00:46:39,877 --> 00:46:42,877
No, wrong address! Next door...

654
00:46:42,878 --> 00:46:45,878
I was told you were pretty.

655
00:46:45,879 --> 00:46:47,317
Oh, yeah?

656
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:49,627
He's Guy. I work with him.

657
00:46:49,805 --> 00:46:51,136
- We work together.
- He's what?

658
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:52,569
- Guy.
- Guy.

659
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:54,106
He's punk.

660
00:46:55,277 --> 00:46:57,438
So? What?

661
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,395
Not prick-teases, I hope?

662
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:01,564
No, we have sex, too!

663
00:47:06,555 --> 00:47:09,564
Does she always dance like that?

664
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:12,490
Yes. Always.

665
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:19,259
Yeah? Is it only when she gets a bit drunk
or is it always like that?

666
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:22,529
- Do you mind?
- No, I have no problem. I have no problem.

667
00:47:22,705 --> 00:47:26,732
I mean, I can't imagine how anyone would
end up doing that with Guy, you know?

668
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:33,246
Hey, I composed this piece of music
for your piano.

669
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:35,975
You could play it all night.

670
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:37,243
Try it.

671
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:40,547
- It's called, "My Dear Neighbors."
- Thank you.

672
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:43,589
- It's sweet.
- I hope you like it.

673
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:48,185
- Hey.
- Hey.

674
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:50,161
What are you doing? What are you doing?

675
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:51,799
What am I doing? You confuse me.

676
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:54,162
So you like her or you like Zo?

677
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:56,497
Man, I'm just talking to her.
She's my neighbor.

678
00:47:56,672 --> 00:48:00,108
We're just friends. Don't you believe
in friendship with the opposite sex?

679
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:04,109
No. She likes you, it's obvious.
Don't play with her.

680
00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:07,377
I mean, she's great, you know.
She's a really nice person...

681
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:09,642
...but she reminds me of my father.

682
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:11,809
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

683
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:18,559
Hey, we're going now.

684
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:20,251
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

685
00:48:20,696 --> 00:48:22,425
Bye-bye.

686
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:27,896
Hey, don't forget
the forest and the boat, eh?

687
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:30,528
Okay, I won't.

688
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:32,105
- Okay.
- Be a good boy.

689
00:48:32,274 --> 00:48:34,174
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, good, okay.

690
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,107
Bye.

691
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:09,504
Stephanie?

692
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:12,442
Stephanie.

693
00:49:12,848 --> 00:49:14,372
Steph...

694
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,040
You're fired. Guy, you're fired.

695
00:49:16,218 --> 00:49:18,516
You're fired. Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

696
00:49:19,354 --> 00:49:21,083
You're dogs. You're like the...

697
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:25,249
The dogs that bite the hand
of the owner that gives you food.

698
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:27,122
Serge, you betrayed me.

699
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:29,264
Guy, are you betraying me?

700
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:54,278
Television Educative is back for you
this evening for a new chapter.

701
00:49:54,456 --> 00:49:56,356
Love after 50.

702
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:59,255
We have two very special guests
on the show today.

703
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:01,589
Gérard and Mom.

704
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:04,392
Gérard, you are a professional magician.

705
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:07,296
You look old and you live
in a small suburban house.

706
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:09,164
Why do you think Mom chose you?

707
00:50:09,338 --> 00:50:12,034
Oh, yes, you're funny. Yes.

708
00:50:16,843 --> 00:50:19,019
- Do the tablecloth one!
- Not tonight.

709
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,020
Go on.

710
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:23,091
Oh, shit! I told you.

711
00:50:23,092 --> 00:50:24,879
It takes preparation.

712
00:50:25,587 --> 00:50:27,919
I wouldn't like to be
the woman you cut in half.

713
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
Imagine!

714
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:29,921
It's not funny.

715
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:32,256
But hold on.

716
00:50:34,146 --> 00:50:35,319
Thanks for my dinner.

717
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:36,589
Okay, then.

718
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,643
Why didn't you go to work today?

719
00:50:40,644 --> 00:50:43,035
- I did
- Pouchet phoned.

720
00:50:43,036 --> 00:50:44,464
I did, Mom!

721
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:48,046
I worked all day...in my dream.

722
00:50:48,824 --> 00:50:50,548
I'm very tired.

723
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:54,973
Since he was 6,
he's inverted dream and reality.

724
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:58,037
He'd be in bed, vomit all over,

725
00:50:58,038 --> 00:51:01,343
sure his hand were like tower blocks.

726
00:51:01,344 --> 00:51:03,427
Houses, mom. Not towers

727
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:07,599
Dreams are very tiring.
They have cycles.

728
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,012
You got slow-wave sleep,
deep sleep, dream sleep.

729
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:15,765
Gérard, you're just a bullshit guru.

730
00:51:16,104 --> 00:51:18,937
Mom, why do you
always fall for gurus?

731
00:51:19,107 --> 00:51:21,667
You think you will learn
some deep truth about yourself?

732
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:23,944
My dad was not a guru.

733
00:51:25,259 --> 00:51:26,187
He must be in love.

734
00:51:26,188 --> 00:51:27,808
Are you in love, Stephane?

735
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,179
Have you met someone?

736
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:36,256
Stephane? Stephane?

737
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:40,424
No, no. No.

738
00:51:41,075 --> 00:51:42,558
Love extrapolated your REM.

739
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,559
OH OK

740
00:51:43,866 --> 00:51:46,164
Do you know what REM means?

741
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,633
Rapid Eye Monitronics.

742
00:51:49,238 --> 00:51:52,014
Your eyes follow your dream movements.

743
00:51:52,015 --> 00:51:54,315
If you walk downstairs, say,

744
00:51:55,258 --> 00:51:59,477
Your eyes go down. Turn right-the eyes go right.

745
00:51:59,878 --> 00:52:02,717
It's in your dream,
your eyes art walking.

746
00:52:02,718 --> 00:52:04,242
The eyes.

747
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:07,014
I can control my eyes in my sleep.

748
00:52:07,422 --> 00:52:09,583
No more sleeping slavery.

749
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,994
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are approaching the moon... What?

750
00:52:21,169 --> 00:52:22,932
The moon, yeah.

751
00:52:26,341 --> 00:52:27,740
Scary, huh?

752
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,537
It's very scary, huh?

753
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:32,938
No gravitation pull.

754
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:45,458
Earthquake and fire!

755
00:52:53,936 --> 00:52:55,631
Okay, that's enough. That's enough.

756
00:52:56,405 --> 00:52:59,897
Please, give us our...
I mean, your world back.

757
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:02,543
Tell us what to do.
We'll do anything.

758
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:04,975
Just don't make me work
like a slave all the time.

759
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:06,273
- Okay.
- Okay?

760
00:53:07,249 --> 00:53:09,183
- Master.
- Okay.

761
00:53:09,885 --> 00:53:12,683
- Peace.
- Okay. Okay.

762
00:53:30,939 --> 00:53:33,032
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

763
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:55,621
- Praise to you and to the new world.
- No, no, stop that.

764
00:53:55,797 --> 00:53:57,822
Hey, no, no. Guys, no.
Stop that shit, okay?

765
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,228
It's getting a bit creepy.

766
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:01,298
Are we still making calendars?

767
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,698
We are here to serve you.

768
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:05,101
Basically, I wanna
see Stephanie in my dreams.

769
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:09,266
I know. I will make your novel,
I am Just Your Neighbor, into a bestseller.

770
00:54:09,444 --> 00:54:13,278
- That will attract her.
- Then we'll organize a massive wedding.

771
00:54:13,448 --> 00:54:15,507
Madame Stephanie Stephane.

772
00:54:19,988 --> 00:54:24,015
Stephane Miroux, your novel
I'm Just Your Neighbor and a Liar.

773
00:54:24,192 --> 00:54:27,184
By the Way, Do You Have Zo? s Number?
Is a blockbuster.

774
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:29,694
- Yeah.
- Where does your genius end?

775
00:54:29,865 --> 00:54:33,892
Painting, sculpturing,
architecturing, writering?

776
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:37,630
Today, building has began on the
Stephane Miroux Foundation.

777
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:39,671
A museum dedicated to your work.

778
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:42,708
So, Stephane Miroux,
did you find the key to success?

779
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:44,911
Well...

780
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:50,146
Well, I think people empathize
with what I do...

781
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:52,377
...because it comes from here.

782
00:54:52,554 --> 00:54:54,545
Oh, you are talking about Stephanie?

783
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:57,283
Oh, I don't like to talk
about my private life.

784
00:54:57,459 --> 00:55:00,895
So, Stephane Miroux,
we have a little surprise for you to do.

785
00:55:01,063 --> 00:55:02,052
No.

786
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,425
- A song for her.
- A song?

787
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:21,775
If you rescue me

788
00:55:23,151 --> 00:55:26,882
I'll be your friend forever

789
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:31,491
Let me in your bed

790
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:36,554
I'll keep you warm in winter

791
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:41,493
All the kitties are playing
And they're having such fun

792
00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:45,805
I wish it could happen to me

793
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:50,137
But if you rescue me

794
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:55,916
It's a pain.

795
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,782
All the cars drive so fast

796
00:55:57,953 --> 00:56:02,083
Stephane Miroux. Stephane Miroux.

797
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:04,689
Stephane Miroux.

798
00:56:05,227 --> 00:56:06,592
Let me into your world

799
00:56:06,761 --> 00:56:07,921
Go now.

800
00:56:08,096 --> 00:56:09,427
I'll keep you warm and amused

801
00:56:10,098 --> 00:56:13,761
All the things we can do in the rain

802
00:56:14,536 --> 00:56:17,528
It's not working because you messed up
the title of my book.

803
00:56:17,706 --> 00:56:19,867
You better be here
when I come back.

804
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:23,636
Okay, I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna wake up now.

805
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:25,245
Hey.

806
00:56:25,413 --> 00:56:27,005
Stephanie.

807
00:56:27,182 --> 00:56:30,413
What a coincidence. I almost thought
that I was gonna miss you.

808
00:56:30,585 --> 00:56:31,813
Would you like to marry me?

809
00:56:33,388 --> 00:56:35,913
Come. Come with me.
I want to show you my friends.

810
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:39,788
Hey, guys? Guys,
let me present you to my future wife.

811
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:49,766
One, I don't believe in marriage,
two, you don't want to be with me.

812
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:52,839
And three, are you out of your mind?

813
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:56,234
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I thought that I was...

814
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:58,038
You thought what?

815
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:00,545
I thought that I was here.

816
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:03,650
And that I was working here,
sleeping in my office.

817
00:57:03,952 --> 00:57:07,911
And then I came here, and then
this part I don't remember very well.

818
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:12,355
There were more people there.
And then I saw you...

819
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:14,825
Where exactly are you living?

820
00:57:17,465 --> 00:57:20,992
I live... I'm staying
with my mother right now.

821
00:57:21,536 --> 00:57:24,096
So you're my landlord's son?

822
00:57:25,006 --> 00:57:26,530
Yeah.

823
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:29,374
Are you sure you're okay, Stephane?

824
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:30,533
Yeah, why?

825
00:57:31,646 --> 00:57:34,513
So you were not asking me for real then?

826
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:37,117
No. To marry you, no.

827
00:57:37,886 --> 00:57:39,353
But...

828
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:43,221
...I think I like you.

829
00:57:44,092 --> 00:57:46,492
You mean in a romantic way?

830
00:57:47,629 --> 00:57:50,530
Yeah, if you want to call it like that.

831
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:55,829
Come on, Stephane.
I don't want to have a boyfriend.

832
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:01,801
Okay.

833
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:04,912
So now you'll act all weird around me
because I didn't want to...

834
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,480
No. It's not my fault, you know,
if I have feelings.

835
00:58:07,649 --> 00:58:09,276
You don't have to humiliate me.

836
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:12,978
Oh, come on, Stephane.
Stop acting like a child.

837
00:58:16,424 --> 00:58:17,948
Stephane?

838
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,911
Something wrong?

839
00:58:31,548 --> 00:58:33,829
Will you manage all those files?

840
00:58:39,525 --> 00:58:41,733
"A heart that sighs has not what is desires."

841
00:58:42,737 --> 00:58:43,748
Must be love.

842
00:58:43,985 --> 00:58:46,180
Working is the best remedy then.

843
00:58:46,354 --> 00:58:47,912
Keeps your brain busy.

844
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:51,923
How can you work? Love is too powerful.
You can't concentrate.

845
00:58:51,924 --> 00:58:54,723
Give him a break.
He doesn't want to talk.

846
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:57,390
Listen. Tell her right away.

847
00:58:57,565 --> 00:59:00,500
If it's from your heart,
she will understand.

848
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:03,256
Maybe the feeling’s not mutual.

849
00:59:04,075 --> 00:59:05,873
Maybe she's with somebody.

850
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:07,641
Shit!

851
00:59:07,642 --> 00:59:09,075
She's with somebody, Stephane?

852
00:59:09,076 --> 00:59:11,369
You're so heavy, you two!

853
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:16,849
Stephane, tell the companieros they're so heavios.

854
00:59:17,252 --> 00:59:18,947
What? I don't understand you, Guy.

855
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,951
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

856
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:22,919
I don't understand you either.

857
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:26,288
I can't understand you when you
talk to me in two different languages.

858
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:31,524
It makes me feel schizometric.
Schizo... Schizo...

859
00:59:36,538 --> 00:59:39,974
Schizophrenic.
That's the word you're looking for.

860
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:42,837
- Yeah.
- Hey, don't pay attention to those losers.

861
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:45,980
Try to be more on time
in the morning. They'll leave you alone.

862
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:48,505
No, no, no.

863
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:51,245
NPC's for film.

864
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:54,115
CPN goes with CPP.

865
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:06,223
CPP.

866
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:10,599
CPP, NPC, CP... I get confused.

867
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:13,499
You know the...

868
01:00:13,675 --> 01:00:15,734
The goat on the cliff?

869
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,037
- The goat on the cliff?
- Goat on the cliff. No?

870
01:00:18,213 --> 01:00:21,307
- It's a sex position.
- I know it's hard for you to understand...

871
01:00:21,483 --> 01:00:23,747
...but not every man is
a sex maniac, you know.

872
01:00:23,918 --> 01:00:25,146
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

873
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,686
Like every woman is romantic?

874
01:00:27,856 --> 01:00:29,414
I don't know, but...

875
01:00:44,638 --> 01:00:46,731
I am collecting beautiful objects.

876
01:00:48,508 --> 01:00:50,533
A pair of shoes.

877
01:00:53,313 --> 01:00:55,338
Some glasses.

878
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:59,643
Telephone.

879
01:01:00,721 --> 01:01:02,689
Typewriter.

880
01:01:02,856 --> 01:01:04,619
They are made from wood and felt.

881
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,884
With apparent stitches.

882
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:10,325
Their delicate and finished
appearance is friendly.

883
01:01:10,497 --> 01:01:12,556
And they are quiet.

884
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:15,831
Stephanie made them, and I will
expose them in an exhibition.

885
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:19,063
Stephanie, do you think I could
take the red blanket as well?

886
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:21,002
Of course, Stephane. Are you kidding?

887
01:01:21,174 --> 01:01:23,267
There's this amazing blanket.

888
01:01:23,443 --> 01:01:27,379
It's thick, red felt
with big white stitches.

889
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:29,538
Wild animals are running on it.

890
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,328
She smiles.

891
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:46,497
I bend over a rock to try to reach her.

892
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:50,763
My stomach, compressed, hurts.

893
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:57,476
Stephanie?

894
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:01,939
Can you hold my hand?

895
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,047
I cannot sleep.

896
01:02:09,189 --> 01:02:12,158
She takes it. I fall asleep.

897
01:02:33,313 --> 01:02:35,042
The sea.

898
01:02:41,088 --> 01:02:43,056
And the forest.

899
01:02:52,432 --> 01:02:55,094
You should put more whites in.

900
01:02:55,502 --> 01:02:56,730
You should put more whites.

901
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:58,461
Yeah?

902
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,740
No, a bit...
A bit more to the left, here.

903
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:14,410
- Oh, yeah.
- Randomness is very difficult to achieve.

904
01:03:14,588 --> 01:03:18,285
Organization always merges back
if you don't pay attention.

905
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:20,858
Death to organization.

906
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,221
Hey, what's this?

907
01:03:25,832 --> 01:03:27,561
- It's the...
- Is it your mom's?

908
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:31,693
No. That's the one-second time travel
machine I told you about.

909
01:03:31,872 --> 01:03:34,033
I finished it. For you.

910
01:03:35,776 --> 01:03:37,368
You wanna try it?

911
01:03:38,378 --> 01:03:40,539
What are you going to do
with one second?

912
01:03:40,714 --> 01:03:42,545
Well, it just adds up.

913
01:03:42,716 --> 01:03:44,513
And life is too precious.

914
01:03:46,052 --> 01:03:48,486
So, basically, you put this here.

915
01:03:48,655 --> 01:03:51,283
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

916
01:03:52,692 --> 01:03:54,057
Oh, can you... Okay.

917
01:03:54,227 --> 01:03:55,785
So...

918
01:03:56,296 --> 01:03:57,524
Just one second.

919
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,496
This is for the past.
And this is for the future, okay?

920
01:04:02,669 --> 01:04:04,159
So let's try some for the past.

921
01:04:04,337 --> 01:04:06,669
You have to press
this button, okay?

922
01:04:09,276 --> 01:04:11,471
Let's try some for the past.

923
01:04:11,645 --> 01:04:13,112
Let's try some for the past.

924
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,872
Hey, it's working.

925
01:04:15,048 --> 01:04:17,448
Amazing scientific breakthrough.

926
01:04:17,617 --> 01:04:20,051
...scientific breakthrough.

927
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,781
Yeah. No, wait, wait.
Let's save some for the future.

928
01:04:27,093 --> 01:04:29,061
Wait, wait, wait.

929
01:04:31,364 --> 01:04:32,888
Hey, what are you...?

930
01:04:33,066 --> 01:04:34,328
Let me just...

931
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:36,992
Why did you do it twice?

932
01:04:37,337 --> 01:04:39,635
The first time was the future...

933
01:04:39,806 --> 01:04:42,104
...and the second one
was just the present.

934
01:04:42,275 --> 01:04:45,301
Well, maybe we have different
perspectives on the future.

935
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:49,245
No, no, no. This is just a machine.
It's objective. It's just a machine.

936
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:51,077
Yeah, okay.

937
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:54,152
I'm not sure I should accept this gift.

938
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:57,017
Why do I deserve a present, anyway?

939
01:04:58,391 --> 01:05:01,121
Because for the occasion
that you are pretty.

940
01:05:01,294 --> 01:05:02,784
Oh, shut up.

941
01:05:02,963 --> 01:05:04,521
You're sweet.

942
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:08,158
So you think I'm only pretty.

943
01:05:08,335 --> 01:05:10,633
Like, I'm pretty and stupid.

944
01:05:10,804 --> 01:05:15,298
- Well, no, maybe you shouldn't have this.
- No, no, no. This is my present.

945
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:17,509
Okay, let's go back to work.

946
01:05:17,844 --> 01:05:19,869
The ocean's drying.

947
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:23,579
- What...?
- I'm just seeing...

948
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,240
You have one thing.

949
01:05:25,418 --> 01:05:29,218
- Do you have something to say?
- No, no.

950
01:05:29,389 --> 01:05:32,119
Focus and concentration.

951
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:35,386
Distraction is an obstruction
to the construction.

952
01:05:35,562 --> 01:05:37,962
Distraction is an obstruction
for the construction.

953
01:05:39,432 --> 01:05:42,060
Distraction is an obstruction
for the construction.

954
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:07,618
- Oh, look.
- What?

955
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:09,227
Skiers.

956
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:14,998
Oh, look, look!

957
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:15,999
A sloping lake!

958
01:06:17,404 --> 01:06:18,393
A lake what?

959
01:06:18,394 --> 01:06:19,394
A sloping lake!

960
01:06:21,575 --> 01:06:25,306
- Weird. That's really weird.
- Stephane, talk with your heart.

961
01:06:25,478 --> 01:06:29,539
- Yeah, be gentle.
- Fuck her.

962
01:06:29,716 --> 01:06:31,911
No, no. Don't rush.

963
01:06:32,085 --> 01:06:35,521
- The goat on the cliff, remember?
- What?

964
01:06:36,623 --> 01:06:38,250
What's the goat on the cliff?

965
01:06:38,425 --> 01:06:40,325
It's a little children's story.

966
01:06:40,493 --> 01:06:43,087
It's, it's silly, don't listen to that.

967
01:06:43,263 --> 01:06:44,821
Don't listen. Don't listen.

968
01:06:44,822 --> 01:06:49,241
You take her form behind on the side of the bed.

969
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:51,086
Oh, I'll try that.

970
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:53,105
You pigs! Stop it!

971
01:06:53,106 --> 01:06:55,597
- On the cliff.
- The goat on the cliff!

972
01:06:55,775 --> 01:06:57,868
Martine, the goat on the cliff.

973
01:06:58,044 --> 01:06:59,534
Serge.

974
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:29,631
- I'll go first.
- No.

975
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:31,674
- I don't know how to ski.
- Come on.

976
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:34,473
- I don't wanna go.
- It's easy. Courage, pretty boy.

977
01:09:08,007 --> 01:09:09,804
Wait, wait, wait.
It's not gonna hurt.

978
01:09:09,976 --> 01:09:11,671
It's not gonna hurt.

979
01:09:19,986 --> 01:09:21,385
Okay.

980
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:24,816
Okay, good.

981
01:09:27,093 --> 01:09:30,654
- Good.
- Hey, you take the glue gun, and I'll try this.

982
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,058
No, no, no.

983
01:09:32,232 --> 01:09:34,132
Why don't we,
why don't we do the scene...

984
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,666
...when you walk
into the apartment...

985
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:38,827
...and you discover the pony, yeah?

986
01:09:39,005 --> 01:09:40,233
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah?

987
01:09:40,406 --> 01:09:42,931
Okay. So come, come, come.

988
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:46,169
You must be... Okay. Yeah, there.

989
01:09:46,913 --> 01:09:49,381
- Oh, wait.
- All right, okay, you're there.

990
01:09:49,549 --> 01:09:52,575
So basically you're just
walking into the apartment...

991
01:09:52,752 --> 01:09:55,050
...and you discover
that the pony can run...

992
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:58,418
...and you feel very excited, and...

993
01:09:58,591 --> 01:10:01,560
Ready? And action.

994
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:04,127
Damn it, Stephane,
you've ruined my pony.

995
01:10:04,297 --> 01:10:07,994
- Why did you do that?
- Cut. What are you doing?

996
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:09,999
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

997
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:12,070
No, you should be ecstatic about me.

998
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:15,867
You should be, like,
praising my ingenue and genius.

999
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:18,408
Of course, my handsome.

1000
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:21,509
No, don't play with me.
This is never gonna happen.

1001
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:23,649
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

1002
01:10:23,817 --> 01:10:25,717
Why are you trying
to give me hope?

1003
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:28,786
Hope? Maybe you should try.

1004
01:10:28,955 --> 01:10:30,320
Try.

1005
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:33,186
Well, next time I'll see you,
I'll kiss you?

1006
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:35,452
- Is that what you're asking me?
- Yeah.

1007
01:10:35,628 --> 01:10:37,357
- Really?
- Yeah, you should try.

1008
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:39,725
I should just
go out there and kiss you.

1009
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:41,230
Yeah.

1010
01:10:42,535 --> 01:10:44,162
Okay.

1011
01:10:44,437 --> 01:10:45,768
- Yeah.
- Go on.

1012
01:10:59,219 --> 01:11:01,050
What are you doing?

1013
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:03,621
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1014
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:06,350
Can you pretend that I,
that you didn't see me?

1015
01:11:06,526 --> 01:11:08,960
- I was just leaving, right now.
- This is stupid.

1016
01:11:09,128 --> 01:11:11,096
- You broke into my place?
- I'm sorry.

1017
01:11:11,264 --> 01:11:13,425
- What are you looking for?
- I'm sorry.

1018
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,966
That's creepy. No, this way.

1019
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:20,030
- Good night.
- Oh, I forgot my keys.

1020
01:11:37,724 --> 01:11:40,352
- Hello?
- Stephane?

1021
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,851
Are you okay?

1022
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:45,420
I love my pony.

1023
01:11:45,598 --> 01:11:47,429
I can't believe you did that.

1024
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:50,093
How did you do it?

1025
01:11:53,106 --> 01:11:55,666
I'm sorry about what I said.

1026
01:11:55,842 --> 01:11:57,139
I didn't mean one word.

1027
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:59,073
- No...
- Okay?

1028
01:11:59,245 --> 01:12:00,576
No, I'm a creep.

1029
01:12:00,747 --> 01:12:02,339
Just like you said.

1030
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:06,383
Listen, Stephane.
You have to toughen up a little.

1031
01:12:06,953 --> 01:12:10,445
It's not attractive for a girl
to see a guy crying.

1032
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:12,318
I know, it sucks.

1033
01:12:13,526 --> 01:12:17,053
You know I named
Golden the Pony Boy after you.

1034
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,858
No, come on. Come on.

1035
01:12:20,033 --> 01:12:23,161
It's not true. You had him
before we met.

1036
01:12:23,336 --> 01:12:24,826
No, no, it is true.

1037
01:12:25,004 --> 01:12:28,940
I improvised his name when
you saw him for the first time.

1038
01:12:29,108 --> 01:12:31,269
He didn't have a name.

1039
01:12:31,444 --> 01:12:33,537
Now, tell me how you did it.

1040
01:12:33,713 --> 01:12:35,271
Golden is galloping for real.

1041
01:12:35,448 --> 01:12:38,474
It's unreal.

1042
01:12:39,619 --> 01:12:40,881
Well...

1043
01:12:41,587 --> 01:12:46,286
It's just an application
of the chaos theory.

1044
01:12:47,126 --> 01:12:48,457
Random control.

1045
01:12:48,628 --> 01:12:49,925
Each leg has one engine...

1046
01:12:50,096 --> 01:12:52,496
...and it moves backwards
or forwards depending on...

1047
01:12:52,665 --> 01:12:56,761
...the movement on the other leg.
It's like life.

1048
01:12:57,236 --> 01:13:00,069
But in a simplified version.

1049
01:13:01,007 --> 01:13:03,339
And it doesn't reproduce.

1050
01:13:05,979 --> 01:13:09,005
I'm glad we live
next door to each other.

1051
01:13:11,384 --> 01:13:13,045
Will you...

1052
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,178
Would you marry me when we're 70?

1053
01:13:17,357 --> 01:13:20,155
You've got nothing to lose.

1054
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:25,922
Okay.

1055
01:13:26,099 --> 01:13:28,067
Would you mind...

1056
01:13:28,935 --> 01:13:31,995
...keep on talking to me
for a little while?

1057
01:13:32,705 --> 01:13:36,402
Because I always thought
it was possible to talk from my sleep.

1058
01:13:36,576 --> 01:13:39,568
I feel that I'm falling down
into a black hole.

1059
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:43,941
You know that you could never see
someone fall in a black hole.

1060
01:13:44,117 --> 01:13:47,280
Because the image of the traveler
who passes the horizon...

1061
01:13:47,453 --> 01:13:52,117
...would slow down till it would remain
stuck in the same position...

1062
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:54,691
The state he was
when he crossed the line.

1063
01:13:54,861 --> 01:13:57,227
Only it's getting redder.

1064
01:13:57,397 --> 01:14:01,424
The traveler gets crushed into spaghetti.

1065
01:14:01,868 --> 01:14:05,065
I don't wanna be a spaghetti,
I don't wanna be spaghetti.

1066
01:14:05,238 --> 01:14:06,796
No, you won't be a spaghetti.

1067
01:14:06,973 --> 01:14:08,338
I don't wanna be a spaghetti.

1068
01:14:08,508 --> 01:14:10,772
Stephane?

1069
01:14:11,911 --> 01:14:15,347
- Are you here?
- No, I'm there! I'm there.

1070
01:14:15,515 --> 01:14:18,541
It worked! I'm not a spaghetti!

1071
01:14:18,718 --> 01:14:21,846
Tell me, tell me. Describe all you can see.

1072
01:14:22,021 --> 01:14:23,921
I feel some grass under my feet.

1073
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:25,921
And it's a bit windy.

1074
01:14:26,092 --> 01:14:29,425
And cold. And damp.

1075
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:32,462
And there's forest all around me.

1076
01:14:33,366 --> 01:14:36,995
And I can see Golden the Pony Boy.
Galloping here. Here, right in front of me.

1077
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:40,936
And I can hear some water.
But I cannot see it.

1078
01:14:42,442 --> 01:14:44,467
Oh, here it is. The river.

1079
01:14:44,644 --> 01:14:48,273
Is the water made of millions
of tiny pieces of cellophane?

1080
01:14:48,448 --> 01:14:50,541
No, it's real water.

1081
01:14:50,716 --> 01:14:53,378
Oh, look. I just found the time machine.

1082
01:14:53,553 --> 01:14:55,578
The time machine is here.

1083
01:15:01,761 --> 01:15:03,854
And it works.

1084
01:15:09,202 --> 01:15:12,467
Stephane, are you asleep?

1085
01:15:14,107 --> 01:15:15,972
Stephanie, you know my mom, Christine.

1086
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:17,439
Two months later

1087
01:15:18,976 --> 01:15:21,115
He's shy.
He only speaks French to me.

1088
01:15:21,147 --> 01:15:23,707
Yeah, I cannot talk French
because whenever I speak...

1089
01:15:23,883 --> 01:15:27,375
...I feel that my moustache grows
more than when I speak Spanish.

1090
01:15:27,553 --> 01:15:29,418
Stephanie.

1091
01:15:29,419 --> 01:15:32,388
Let me kiss you
You're a good person.

1092
01:15:33,299 --> 01:15:36,398
You sure, Mrs.Miroux?
He said nothing bad about me?

1093
01:15:36,692 --> 01:15:40,156
No, nothing.
I choose my tenants carefully.

1094
01:15:41,742 --> 01:15:43,208
So, what do you think?

1095
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:44,669
I adore it!

1096
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:48,279
Really? I've always found it rather strange.

1097
01:15:51,688 --> 01:15:53,881
- I like the colors
- Unusual.

1098
01:15:58,537 --> 01:15:59,702
Not very cheerful!

1099
01:16:00,353 --> 01:16:03,411
Six months ago,
a stranger came to see me

1100
01:16:04,938 --> 01:16:08,351
with a terrible accent and a dumb project.

1101
01:16:08,352 --> 01:16:11,464
The world and myself weren't ready for it.

1102
01:16:12,422 --> 01:16:14,887
We've leaped forward into absurdity.

1103
01:16:14,888 --> 01:16:17,625
And I regret to say our new calendar.

1104
01:16:18,285 --> 01:16:22,284
"Disasterology" by Mr Stephane Miroux,

1105
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,053
is a huge success!

1106
01:16:31,851 --> 01:16:33,117
In French.

1107
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,011
No, in English, Mom.

1108
01:16:36,822 --> 01:16:38,312
I...

1109
01:16:40,426 --> 01:16:43,395
I wanna dedicate this
to all the victims...

1110
01:16:43,563 --> 01:16:45,622
Okay, thank you, Mr. Miroux.

1111
01:16:45,798 --> 01:16:50,895
Without them, without them,
it would not have been possible.

1112
01:17:37,516 --> 01:17:39,848
I'm sorry. Are you upset?

1113
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:15,187
This girl is at once all the women
that broke my heart.

1114
01:18:15,354 --> 01:18:19,518
She's so beautiful and generous
and she's asking me to leave.

1115
01:18:19,692 --> 01:18:21,717
Because she's dumping me.

1116
01:18:21,894 --> 01:18:25,489
She's dumping me because
I am a cheap drug dealer.

1117
01:18:25,665 --> 01:18:28,657
And I am a drug dealer
because she wants to leave me.

1118
01:18:29,802 --> 01:18:32,032
The police are going to get me now.

1119
01:18:32,204 --> 01:18:34,035
This is all my fault.

1120
01:19:33,766 --> 01:19:35,996
He is my opposite.

1121
01:19:36,335 --> 01:19:38,530
She feels safe around him.

1122
01:19:39,872 --> 01:19:41,931
She's in love with him.

1123
01:20:09,769 --> 01:20:12,966
Things will turn out the way you want.

1124
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:17,202
If you could just stop doubting
that I love you.

1125
01:20:18,077 --> 01:20:21,171
Call me home. Next door.

1126
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:54,941
That needs an explanation.

1127
01:20:55,099 --> 01:20:57,231
Look who's woken up.

1128
01:20:57,232 --> 01:21:00,434
Have a drink.
Your mom's feeling down.

1129
01:21:00,435 --> 01:21:03,215
She needs comforting.
She's moving back in.

1130
01:21:03,216 --> 01:21:06,105
That calls for a drink. Come on.

1131
01:21:08,395 --> 01:21:10,142
Not exactly a triumph.

1132
01:21:44,396 --> 01:21:45,863
It's not fair.

1133
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:49,159
She changed exactly the second
I started to like her.

1134
01:21:49,335 --> 01:21:52,202
It's like a big bang.
The first instant, it's very small...

1135
01:21:52,371 --> 01:21:55,101
...and then the next nano instant:

1136
01:21:55,274 --> 01:21:58,209
Huge. Infinite.

1137
01:21:59,211 --> 01:22:02,578
I wish I could travel back to the time
when I didn't find her attractive.

1138
01:22:02,748 --> 01:22:05,581
You should have asked me.
She has a really good ass.

1139
01:22:05,751 --> 01:22:09,585
Shut up, Guy. I thought she was lonely,
and somehow I could help her.

1140
01:22:09,755 --> 01:22:12,747
But no. She doesn't need me at all.

1141
01:22:12,925 --> 01:22:14,825
You know, I don't know
Stephanie and all.

1142
01:22:14,994 --> 01:22:17,554
But maybe she has a pattern.

1143
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:21,097
She doesn't wanna get hurt,
and by that she's hurting people.

1144
01:22:21,267 --> 01:22:25,033
And by hurting people, she thinks
she's not gonna get hurt, but she gets hurt.

1145
01:22:25,204 --> 01:22:29,436
I don't know. I love her
because she makes things.

1146
01:22:29,608 --> 01:22:32,702
You know? She makes things
with her hands.

1147
01:22:32,878 --> 01:22:37,315
It's as if her synapses
was married directly to her fingers.

1148
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,881
Like this. In this way.

1149
01:22:41,053 --> 01:22:43,021
Yeah, yeah.

1150
01:22:44,657 --> 01:22:47,592
Man, I wish I could talk to my dad.

1151
01:22:49,395 --> 01:22:53,126
I miss my father. I cannot talk
with my mom when I'm sad.

1152
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:58,256
It's outrageous to attack the hospital staff.
Appalling.

1153
01:22:58,257 --> 01:23:02,076
Well, it's a big letdown for our charming nurses

1154
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:06,912
who go beyond the call of duty with a wet T-shirt
contest...

1155
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:09,614
Asshole! Dumb asshole!

1156
01:23:14,343 --> 01:23:16,702
- Let's take our mind off it
- The TV?

1157
01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:21,255
You know, you can't let things
bother you all your life.

1158
01:23:21,427 --> 01:23:23,190
A man has to take matters
in his hands.

1159
01:23:23,362 --> 01:23:26,798
This TV is brainwashing my weekends.

1160
01:23:26,966 --> 01:23:30,367
I should be...
Instead, I'm just watching this.

1161
01:23:38,175 --> 01:23:39,352
You wanna fight?

1162
01:23:39,612 --> 01:23:42,308
I'm sorry, I wasn't sure I was awake.

1163
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:46,713
Awake? I will awake you for sure
if you carry on like this.

1164
01:23:46,885 --> 01:23:50,651
Here, help me,
instead of being stupid aleck.

1165
01:23:50,652 --> 01:23:54,271
Over there!
It'll make a better splash.

1166
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,617
One, two, three!

1167
01:24:01,108 --> 01:24:02,363
Are u crazy?

1168
01:24:03,407 --> 01:24:04,870
It isn't a garbage dump!

1169
01:24:05,775 --> 01:24:07,320
TV's garbage anyways!

1170
01:24:07,321 --> 01:24:10,067
It is garbage, but that's no reason...

1171
01:24:11,327 --> 01:24:12,343
It floats!

1172
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:13,333
It floats, yeah.

1173
01:24:13,334 --> 01:24:16,201
Maybe the fish enjoy that crap!

1174
01:24:16,202 --> 01:24:17,542
- Really?
- Yeah.

1175
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:31,856
Stephane?

1176
01:24:34,233 --> 01:24:36,428
Stephane. Wait.

1177
01:24:37,136 --> 01:24:38,364
Do you feel better?

1178
01:24:39,104 --> 01:24:40,696
I'm going to work.

1179
01:24:41,674 --> 01:24:43,437
I just want to know if you're okay.

1180
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:46,077
Yeah, I'm super-fine. Thanks.

1181
01:24:46,779 --> 01:24:49,680
So I get it. So you don't want
to be my friend anymore.

1182
01:24:49,848 --> 01:24:53,614
No, I don't wanna be your friend anymore.
I don't wanna be your friend anymore.

1183
01:24:53,786 --> 01:24:57,187
Do I have to nail it on your door?
I don't wanna be your friend.

1184
01:24:57,656 --> 01:25:01,456
No, you... You can't.
You can't stop being my friend.

1185
01:25:01,627 --> 01:25:04,255
- It's not something people can decide.
- Yeah, they can.

1186
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:07,399
People have an argument and then
they stop talking to each other.

1187
01:25:07,566 --> 01:25:11,024
Okay, then let's have a date or something
and we can talk about things.

1188
01:25:11,203 --> 01:25:13,194
- If that's what you want.
- What's the point?

1189
01:25:13,372 --> 01:25:17,604
You'll want me as a friend. You'll have
a nice boyfriend and that'll kill me.

1190
01:25:17,776 --> 01:25:19,767
By the way, where's the boat?

1191
01:25:19,945 --> 01:25:23,108
Where's everything? Let's face it.
You never finished anything.

1192
01:25:23,282 --> 01:25:25,147
Like the mezzanine and everything else?

1193
01:25:25,317 --> 01:25:28,844
That's not true.
That's absolutely not true.

1194
01:25:29,021 --> 01:25:30,283
I'll show you.

1195
01:25:30,456 --> 01:25:34,756
You're manipulating me or...
I don't, I don't understand.

1196
01:25:35,994 --> 01:25:37,962
Look, here it is.

1197
01:25:39,264 --> 01:25:41,994
Here, here it is. Zo? s number.

1198
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:44,101
That's what you want.

1199
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:49,136
Screw her.
"I'm only your neighbor and a liar.

1200
01:25:49,308 --> 01:25:53,244
"By the way, do you have Zo? s number?"
Do you remember the letter that night?

1201
01:25:53,412 --> 01:25:55,346
How did you get that?

1202
01:25:55,514 --> 01:25:58,711
Wait, wait. Wait, I'm sorry.

1203
01:26:03,989 --> 01:26:06,219
No, no, no. Stop crying.

1204
01:26:06,391 --> 01:26:07,949
Stop crying.

1205
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:15,189
I'm sorry.

1206
01:26:17,736 --> 01:26:19,328
I'm sorry.

1207
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:23,373
- Guy, Guy.
- Hey.

1208
01:26:23,776 --> 01:26:25,767
Did you see the red on?
I'm doing your work.

1209
01:26:25,944 --> 01:26:27,434
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1210
01:26:27,613 --> 01:26:29,945
Something amazing happened
between Stephanie and I.

1211
01:26:30,115 --> 01:26:31,742
- Come on, shut up, now.
- Incredible!

1212
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:34,579
Stop bullshitting. I'm sick
of breaking my balls with you.

1213
01:26:34,753 --> 01:26:36,778
- I'm doing your work. Know why?
- Why?

1214
01:26:36,955 --> 01:26:39,287
Because you're virtually fired,
my sleepy man.

1215
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,426
And mother or not mother
to cover your ass.

1216
01:26:41,427 --> 01:26:44,663
The office is boring!
You can't leave me here.

1217
01:26:45,675 --> 01:26:48,833
- The stupid bitch!
- Not stupid bitch!

1218
01:26:48,834 --> 01:26:50,961
Okay, you don't know
what happens between us.

1219
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,660
Nobody has a clue what happens...

1220
01:26:52,838 --> 01:26:54,806
...and everybody has an opinion.
Fuck that.

1221
01:26:54,973 --> 01:26:59,774
I wrote her a letter in my dream
and I never gave it to her.

1222
01:26:59,945 --> 01:27:03,437
And she read it. I don't know how,
but she somehow read it.

1223
01:27:03,615 --> 01:27:05,845
And she just recited it to me just now.

1224
01:27:06,018 --> 01:27:07,349
Word by word. She knows it.

1225
01:27:07,519 --> 01:27:10,010
And you know why?
Because I think our brains...

1226
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:12,623
...are creating this loop
that is incredibly complex.

1227
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:16,386
It's not as if our brains are communicating
or telepathy or nothing like that.

1228
01:27:16,562 --> 01:27:19,554
It's as if we were evolving
each step into the same direction.

1229
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:22,097
It's called PSR.
Parallel synchronized randomness.

1230
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:25,327
It's incredibly rare. It's as if
we were jigsaw puzzles, you know?

1231
01:27:25,504 --> 01:27:30,407
- And we're falling to, into the...
- Stephane, you will never date her, okay?

1232
01:27:30,576 --> 01:27:34,876
- She will drive you crazy, believe me.
- No, she just asked me for a date.

1233
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:37,447
In 20 minutes at the Bar de l'Oreille.
I have to go.

1234
01:27:37,616 --> 01:27:40,176
Minutes at the Bar de l'Oreille.
I have to go.

1235
01:27:40,562 --> 01:27:41,686
What was that?

1236
01:27:41,687 --> 01:27:43,518
It's my travel, time travel machine.

1237
01:27:43,519 --> 01:27:44,519
No, wait...

1238
01:27:45,123 --> 01:27:48,058
You just walk in, Pouchet didn't
see you, so you won't go.

1239
01:27:48,227 --> 01:27:51,856
Oh, come on. Guy, Guy, come on!
It's just once. Okay, just this time.

1240
01:27:51,857 --> 01:27:54,743
I'll cover for you.

1241
01:27:55,778 --> 01:27:59,250
But if you don't screw her or at least kiss her

1242
01:27:59,251 --> 01:28:02,327
with tongues,
a real French kiss.

1243
01:28:02,328 --> 01:28:04,025
a tongue kiss...

1244
01:28:04,732 --> 01:28:06,643
I won't speak to you again!

1245
01:28:11,429 --> 01:28:12,001
Bye..

1246
01:28:17,823 --> 01:28:20,924
If he carries on, he'll leave before he arrives.

1247
01:28:22,619 --> 01:28:24,408
Maybe he works backwards

1248
01:28:24,409 --> 01:28:26,262
He brags with his calendar.

1249
01:28:26,263 --> 01:28:28,452
I sent him on an errand

1250
01:28:28,453 --> 01:28:29,970
You fucking dykes!

1251
01:28:31,786 --> 01:28:33,303
Now that's enough

1252
01:28:33,304 --> 01:28:37,736
Being called fags is one thing, but dykes is unacceptable.

1253
01:28:38,844 --> 01:28:40,812
You will never date her, okay?

1254
01:28:40,979 --> 01:28:43,709
- She will drive you crazy.
- Drive me crazy.

1255
01:28:43,882 --> 01:28:47,181
I refuse to believe only friendship
from Stephanie.

1256
01:28:47,352 --> 01:28:49,252
There are signs that can't be mistaken.

1257
01:28:49,421 --> 01:28:52,788
Can't be mistaken. Look, look.

1258
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:56,652
She kisses me at less than
a centimeter of my lips.

1259
01:28:57,262 --> 01:29:01,255
It is a sign, the most evident,
that she desires me.

1260
01:29:01,433 --> 01:29:04,368
Where should she kiss to her friendly
goodbye? On the forehead?

1261
01:29:04,536 --> 01:29:09,473
No, halfway between the ear and the lips.
That's what's considered normal.

1262
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:12,974
Besides, if I don't move my head back,
she hits me right on the lips.

1263
01:29:13,145 --> 01:29:15,136
Why did you move away
from her kiss, then?

1264
01:29:15,314 --> 01:29:17,976
Maybe I tried to kiss her, who cares?

1265
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:22,780
The point is that she will torture,
torture, torture me all my life.

1266
01:29:22,955 --> 01:29:24,479
She simply doesn't care about me.

1267
01:29:24,656 --> 01:29:27,750
No, this is not true. She cares a lot.
She worships my presence.

1268
01:29:27,926 --> 01:29:31,623
She feels sorry for me.
Pity. That's the worst.

1269
01:29:31,797 --> 01:29:34,595
Exactly. My feeling has reached
the point of pathology...

1270
01:29:34,766 --> 01:29:37,758
...and I can't seduce anyone
without pathology.

1271
01:29:42,207 --> 01:29:45,870
You believe you can seduce her with
your creepy, pathological little gifts?

1272
01:29:46,044 --> 01:29:49,536
They all ended up in the trash,
blinded by your...

1273
01:29:50,215 --> 01:29:52,274
- No.
- Nobody is waiting for you at the bar.

1274
01:29:52,451 --> 01:29:55,181
Stephanie never came.
She lost interest in you long ago.

1275
01:29:56,254 --> 01:29:58,654
- It's too late. Stephanie moved on.
- No.

1276
01:29:58,824 --> 01:30:01,088
- Stephanie moved on. Moved on.
- Go away.

1277
01:30:01,259 --> 01:30:02,487
Will never change her mind.

1278
01:30:03,161 --> 01:30:05,322
Girls never change their mind
when it's over.

1279
01:30:12,237 --> 01:30:14,831
Open the door. I know you are there.

1280
01:30:15,307 --> 01:30:17,275
Open the door.

1281
01:30:17,442 --> 01:30:20,434
You forgot about me.

1282
01:30:22,814 --> 01:30:25,578
Stop playing with me.

1283
01:30:29,988 --> 01:30:33,082
I never want to see you again.

1284
01:31:44,796 --> 01:31:46,855
Say it.

1285
01:31:47,032 --> 01:31:49,830
Say it, you have to say it.

1286
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:53,129
- Listen to me. Listen to me, say it.
- Camera there.

1287
01:31:53,305 --> 01:31:55,671
- Say it.
- Okay, it's all in order. Okay.

1288
01:31:56,708 --> 01:32:00,974
- It won't happen. You have to say it.
- Yeah, just wait a second, wait a second.

1289
01:32:01,146 --> 01:32:03,614
- Go on, say it.
- Okay. Perfect. Yeah.

1290
01:32:03,782 --> 01:32:07,274
Just... Okay. Right there.
Okay, now look at the camera.

1291
01:32:07,452 --> 01:32:09,682
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

1292
01:32:09,683 --> 01:32:11,753
Still hurting?

1293
01:32:16,881 --> 01:32:17,878
Careful...

1294
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,742
It's much better.

1295
01:32:27,633 --> 01:32:30,229
I'll tell the office you are sick

1296
01:32:30,937 --> 01:32:33,215
We'll have a nice, quiet day, OK?

1297
01:32:33,216 --> 01:32:34,243
Mom?

1298
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:39,808
I'm sorry I went with dad when he left.

1299
01:32:39,809 --> 01:32:41,136
That's OK

1300
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:52,409
Thanks

1301
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:54,422
I'll come to the airport.

1302
01:32:54,423 --> 01:32:56,883
- No need
- I can't just leave you

1303
01:32:56,884 --> 01:33:00,541
It's OK, really.
I'll call you from Mexico.

1304
01:33:00,542 --> 01:33:03,938
Go speak to her
Do it for me

1305
01:33:03,939 --> 01:33:04,627
NO...

1306
01:33:05,429 --> 01:33:07,266
I don't want to, now

1307
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,147
I've changed my mind.

1308
01:33:10,148 --> 01:33:12,166
Don't be ridiculous

1309
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:15,189
You can't go without saying goodbye.

1310
01:33:16,449 --> 01:33:17,654
I feel stupid now

1311
01:33:21,056 --> 01:33:24,459
You don't know what happened.
You go on and on.

1312
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:26,597
Stephane this, Stephane that.

1313
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:30,012
Shut the door.

1314
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:44,480
- Hey, Stephane.
- Hey.

1315
01:33:44,649 --> 01:33:46,480
What's going on?

1316
01:33:46,952 --> 01:33:49,887
Nothing's going on. I'm just leaving.

1317
01:33:50,055 --> 01:33:52,148
Yeah, I know.

1318
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:55,787
Are you still upset with me?

1319
01:33:56,528 --> 01:34:00,055
Well, let's just say that
there are some unsolved issues.

1320
01:34:00,232 --> 01:34:01,460
Yeah.

1321
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:03,733
You're not gonna let me in?

1322
01:34:04,669 --> 01:34:07,502
Install a toilet paper dispenser
because people are wiping...

1323
01:34:07,672 --> 01:34:09,572
...their dirty Sanchez here
on your door.

1324
01:34:09,741 --> 01:34:11,038
Oh, shut up.

1325
01:34:12,677 --> 01:34:14,542
How is your head?

1326
01:34:14,713 --> 01:34:16,340
It's okay.

1327
01:34:16,815 --> 01:34:18,510
It's not normal, though.

1328
01:34:18,683 --> 01:34:20,617
Oh, well, of course it's not.

1329
01:34:20,785 --> 01:34:24,949
- It's never going to be.
- Yeah, well, it is not attractive to you.

1330
01:34:25,857 --> 01:34:28,223
I'm glad I made it
through your door, though.

1331
01:34:28,393 --> 01:34:29,758
Don't be glad.

1332
01:34:29,928 --> 01:34:31,156
Be sad.

1333
01:34:33,231 --> 01:34:35,131
Your English is very good.

1334
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,597
What about your French?

1335
01:34:36,768 --> 01:34:40,101
No, I can't speak French with you.
I'm too shy.

1336
01:34:40,272 --> 01:34:42,331
The only thing I can say is:

1337
01:34:42,332 --> 01:34:46,102
I like your tit.
It erects me in my pants...

1338
01:34:47,212 --> 01:34:49,180
Oh, damn it, Stephane.

1339
01:34:49,347 --> 01:34:51,372
What if someone catches fire?

1340
01:34:54,886 --> 01:34:57,013
We've got to help him. Quick.

1341
01:35:06,698 --> 01:35:08,962
Go, go, go!

1342
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:21,240
Anarchy in the cellophane!

1343
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:28,846
You've been crying?

1344
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:32,547
I like it when you cry
because you have to wear your glasses.

1345
01:35:35,226 --> 01:35:37,820
I actually don't like it when you cry.

1346
01:35:38,296 --> 01:35:40,321
I find it horrible.

1347
01:35:40,765 --> 01:35:43,199
Especially when it's not for me.

1348
01:35:43,568 --> 01:35:45,502
Will you cry a little when I'm dead?

1349
01:35:45,837 --> 01:35:49,603
I hate people that pretend that they want
everyone to celebrate their death...

1350
01:35:49,774 --> 01:35:53,175
...you know, and everyone is having
a blast at the party...

1351
01:35:53,345 --> 01:35:55,643
...and nobody gives a shit
for the dead.

1352
01:35:55,814 --> 01:35:57,975
That's horrible. That's bullshit.

1353
01:35:58,149 --> 01:36:02,813
It's like, "Hey, sleep with my girlfriend
after my cremation. Do you mind?"

1354
01:36:02,987 --> 01:36:06,184
You know? Well, my problem is that
I don't have a girlfriend.

1355
01:36:06,358 --> 01:36:08,326
And I'm not dead.

1356
01:36:13,798 --> 01:36:16,460
Look. Put your finger here.

1357
01:36:16,634 --> 01:36:18,124
Touch here.

1358
01:36:18,303 --> 01:36:20,897
At the back of the ear and the glasses.

1359
01:36:21,072 --> 01:36:25,099
It feels like the glasses were
part of your body.

1360
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:28,074
Oh, true. That's weird.

1361
01:36:28,246 --> 01:36:31,215
- I always liked that.
- My contacts are killing me.

1362
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:36,516
It's like if you were touching
your penis with your left hand.

1363
01:36:36,888 --> 01:36:38,617
I don't have a penis.

1364
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:40,223
You have a left hand.

1365
01:36:41,993 --> 01:36:45,087
Why do you always have to be a pig?

1366
01:36:47,966 --> 01:36:50,457
I'm teasing you.

1367
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:56,165
Will you fix your teeth one day?

1368
01:36:58,576 --> 01:37:02,774
- You're mean.
- No, I'm just saying because...

1369
01:37:03,047 --> 01:37:05,140
I mean, it's gonna be 40 years
until we marry.

1370
01:37:05,316 --> 01:37:08,649
And I might as well take care
of my goods now, you know?

1371
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:10,651
Well, actually, you know?

1372
01:37:10,822 --> 01:37:12,084
Don't do anything.

1373
01:37:12,257 --> 01:37:15,226
Maybe no teeth is good
for a blow job.

1374
01:37:16,661 --> 01:37:19,824
Okay. I think you should leave now.

1375
01:37:20,698 --> 01:37:21,926
You gonna be late.

1376
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:24,796
You know, sometimes I wear my jeans
for more than a week...

1377
01:37:24,969 --> 01:37:28,700
...until they're really bad. And it
makes me feel a little bit closer to you.

1378
01:37:29,073 --> 01:37:32,509
- What do you want me to say to that?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1379
01:37:32,677 --> 01:37:34,269
So how is your boyfriend?

1380
01:37:34,446 --> 01:37:36,505
You have a new boyfriend?

1381
01:37:37,048 --> 01:37:38,606
A new boyfriend with long hair...

1382
01:37:38,783 --> 01:37:41,149
...and goes bungee jumping and surfing.

1383
01:37:41,319 --> 01:37:42,809
Does he take you surfing?

1384
01:37:42,987 --> 01:37:45,649
Invite me, I'll go with you.
I don't know how but maybe...

1385
01:37:45,824 --> 01:37:48,019
I mean, if you want me to.

1386
01:37:48,193 --> 01:37:50,184
I don't have a boyfriend.

1387
01:37:50,361 --> 01:37:53,194
And you have a serious problem
of distorting reality.

1388
01:37:53,364 --> 01:37:57,698
You could sleep with the entire planet
and still feel rejected.

1389
01:37:57,869 --> 01:38:01,134
- Please, I'd like you to go now.
- I like your boobs.

1390
01:38:01,506 --> 01:38:04,339
I like your boobs. They are very friendly
and unpretentious.

1391
01:38:04,509 --> 01:38:06,909
I'll appreciate if, one day,
you'll show them to me?

1392
01:38:07,078 --> 01:38:09,444
- Not much to see. Now, go.
- Hey, the mezzanine.

1393
01:38:09,647 --> 01:38:11,308
You finished the mezzanine.

1394
01:38:11,483 --> 01:38:13,644
I thought you were never gonna finish it.

1395
01:38:13,818 --> 01:38:16,412
Like the boat and everything else.

1396
01:38:16,788 --> 01:38:18,415
Is it solid?

1397
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:22,350
Can it hold a boy? A couple?

1398
01:38:22,794 --> 01:38:24,819
What are you doing...? Get out.

1399
01:38:24,996 --> 01:38:26,520
- Get out of here.
- No.

1400
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:29,394
- Get out or I'll call your mother.
- No, my mother? No. No.

1401
01:38:29,601 --> 01:38:31,193
Not my mother.

1402
01:38:31,636 --> 01:38:35,265
- You're gonna miss your plane.
- I don't care. I don't care.

1403
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,172
Why do you do this to me?

1404
01:38:38,343 --> 01:38:39,833
What have I done to you?

1405
01:38:40,011 --> 01:38:42,536
Tell me what do you want me to do?

1406
01:38:44,349 --> 01:38:46,078
I don't know.

1407
01:38:46,985 --> 01:38:48,748
Maybe touch my hair or something?

1408
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:51,150
I can't do that.

1409
01:38:52,924 --> 01:38:54,687
Why me?

1410
01:38:54,859 --> 01:38:57,327
Because everyone else is boring.

1411
01:38:57,495 --> 01:38:59,156
And because you're different.

1412
01:39:01,165 --> 01:39:03,793
You don't like me, Stephanie.

1413
01:40:06,998 --> 01:40:08,863
Stephane?
