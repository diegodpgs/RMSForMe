1
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:37,223
2306, please.

2
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,062
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

3
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:47,024
Good.
What did he say?

4
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:51,654
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

5
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:55,616
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

6
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,327
and then I'll--
I would if I could.

7
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,539
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I--

8
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:05,835
let me get off and I prom--
I promise you it'll be okay.

9
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:11,716
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

10
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:21,976
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

11
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:24,687
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

12
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,440
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

13
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:29,984
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today--

14
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:33,279
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

15
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:35,364
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

16
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,202
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

17
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,871
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

18
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,248
- and he has certain parcels--
- Doctor--

19
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:47,335
well, could you get--
what do you mean?

20
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:50,129
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

21
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:54,175
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

22
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:58,471
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

23
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,765
He has certain parcels--
certain choice parcels

24
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:03,309
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

25
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:06,354
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

26
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:11,401
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

27
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,945
Okay.

28
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:16,614
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

29
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:21,994
Look, you sent in the--
no, no, listen to me now--

30
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:24,789
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

31
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:30,503
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

32
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,757
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

33
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,676
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:38,719
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

35
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,889
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

36
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:44,350
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

37
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,439
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

38
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,024
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

39
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:56,237
You never know-- I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

40
00:04:57,905 --> 00:05:00,491
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

41
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:03,786
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

42
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,705
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

43
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:08,082
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

44
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,668
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

45
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:12,879
You're on an override--
you make money, we make money.

46
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,965
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

47
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,718
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

48
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,053
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

49
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,181
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

50
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:26,100
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

51
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:29,228
- Shelly.
- John.

52
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,397
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

53
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,399
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

54
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:35,777
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing--

55
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,820
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

56
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,156
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

57
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,658
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

58
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,494
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

59
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,621
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead--

60
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:48,748
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

61
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:50,625
I'm in a bind--
personal problems.

62
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,502
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

63
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:55,755
- I hear the new Glengarry leads--
- After the meeting, Shel.

64
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:57,757
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

65
00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:00,384
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

66
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:04,931
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:07,183
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:14,023
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

69
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,858
Cutty, Al.

70
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,447
- They say...
- Huh?

71
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,284
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

72
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:29,872
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

73
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,625
begging the cops
to shoot them.

74
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,505
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

75
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:41,843
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

76
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:45,263
For they say
it dehydrates you.

77
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:48,182
They say
you should drink water,

78
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:52,395
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

79
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:56,816
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

80
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,027
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

81
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,572
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,203
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:11,372
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

84
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:13,750
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

85
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,378
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

86
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,830
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook--

87
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:55,875
five units, Mountain View--
what happens?

88
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:57,752
She has to check
with her lawyer.

89
00:07:57,835 --> 00:08:00,379
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

90
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:03,007
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

91
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:05,176
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

92
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,178
Couldn't tell you.

93
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:10,932
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

94
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:12,725
- They won't give out--
- Uh-huh.

95
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:15,394
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

96
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,647
Who belongs
to the BM--?

97
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,779
It is 7:30.

98
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:26,989
So who is that?

99
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,992
And where is
Mr. Roma?

100
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,744
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

101
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,874
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

102
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,169
You're talking about what?
You're talking about--

103
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:43,589
bitching about
that sale you shot,

104
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:45,883
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

105
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,301
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

106
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,303
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

107
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:51,431
Let's talk
about something important.

108
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,141
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

109
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:54,183
I'm going anyway.

110
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:57,770
Let's talk
about something important.

111
00:08:57,854 --> 00:09:00,231
Put that coffee down.

112
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:07,822
Coffee's for closers only.

113
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:12,702
You think
I'm fucking with you?

114
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,957
I am not fucking with you.

115
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,877
I'm here from downtown.

116
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,503
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

117
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:25,757
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

118
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:33,139
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:37,018
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,811
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

121
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:42,148
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

122
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:46,694
The bad news is you've got--
all of you've got--

123
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:48,780
just one week
to regain your jobs,

124
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:52,325
starting with tonight--
starting with tonight's sit.

125
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:58,206
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

126
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,126
Good...

127
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,296
'cause we're adding
a little something

128
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,006
to this month's
sales contest.

129
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:10,176
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

130
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,261
Anybody want to see
second prize?

131
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,765
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

132
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,645
Third prize is you're fired.

133
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,069
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

134
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:32,573
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

135
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:34,784
Get their names
to sell them.

136
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,869
You can't close
the leads you're given,

137
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:39,622
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

138
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,209
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

139
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:46,754
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

140
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:49,549
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

141
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,592
I've been
in this business 15 years.

142
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:53,970
- What's your name?
- Fuck you--

143
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,556
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

144
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,766
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

145
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,771
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

146
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:11,070
And your name
is "You're wanting."

147
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:14,323
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

148
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,785
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

149
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:21,581
Because only one thing
counts in this life--

150
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:25,042
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

151
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:28,045
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

152
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,722
"A-B-C."

153
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,767
A-- Always,
B-- Be, C-- Closing.

154
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,810
Always Be Closing.

155
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:46,522
"Always Be Closing."

156
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:49,275
"A-I-D-A."

157
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,028
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

158
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,572
Attention--
Do I have your attention?

159
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:56,783
Interest--
Are you interested?

160
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:59,118
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

161
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,162
You close
or you hit the bricks.

162
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:05,458
Decision-- Have you made
your decision for Christ?

163
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:10,213
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."

164
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,590
Get out there--
you got the prospects coming in.

165
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,801
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

166
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,303
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

167
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:20,640
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

168
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,767
Are you gonna take it?

169
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,978
Are you man enough
to take it?

170
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,404
Crap.

171
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,364
What's the problem, pal?
You-- Moss.

172
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:38,908
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

173
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:42,245
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

174
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,874
You see this watch?

175
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:53,297
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:56,551
That watch costs
more than your car.

177
00:12:56,634 --> 00:13:00,680
I made $$70,000 last year.
How much you make?

178
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:08,104
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

179
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:12,066
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

180
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:16,112
Good father? Fuck you--
go home and play with your kids.

181
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,700
You want to work here--
close!

182
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:24,036
You think this is abuse?

183
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,205
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

184
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:29,917
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

185
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:34,505
You don't like it, leave.

186
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:39,886
I can go out there tonight--
the materials you got--

187
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:44,056
make myself $15,000.
Tonight-- in two hours!

188
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:45,933
Can you?

189
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:49,729
Can you?

190
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:54,692
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."

191
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:57,361
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

192
00:13:57,445 --> 00:14:01,365
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

193
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:05,119
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

194
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,460
Go and do likewise,
gents.

195
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,962
The money's out there--
you pick it up, it's yours,

196
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:17,298
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,217
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close--

198
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,010
close-- it's yours.

199
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:23,262
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

200
00:14:23,304 --> 00:14:26,057
And you know
what you'll be saying.

201
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,768
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

202
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,939
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

203
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:44,075
These are the new leads.

204
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:47,203
These are
the Glengarry leads.

205
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,958
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

206
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,794
Why?

207
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:58,881
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

208
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:05,346
They're for closers.

209
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:12,645
I'd wish you good luck,

210
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:14,981
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

211
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:24,157
And to answer your question, pal--
"Why am I here?"

212
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,201
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

213
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,996
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor--

214
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:33,040
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

215
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:35,626
because a loser
is a loser."

216
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:49,223
Bunch of fucking nonsense--

217
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:52,018
treat people like that.

218
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:56,731
The fuck is he going
to get off?

219
00:15:56,814 --> 00:16:00,193
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

220
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,112
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

221
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,364
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

222
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,825
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

223
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:11,037
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

224
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:13,081
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

225
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:15,708
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

226
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,337
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

227
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,173
I think-- I know she is.
I know that she is.

228
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:26,094
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

229
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:30,139
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

230
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,808
Thank you.

231
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:37,230
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

232
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:39,065
What is this in aid of?

233
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,234
- As of tonight--
- What is this? Excuse me.

234
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:43,486
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray--

235
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,280
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

236
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:48,157
I got to put up
with this childishness?

237
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,118
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

238
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,537
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

239
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,043
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

240
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:00,837
As you heard,
end of the month,

241
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,005
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

242
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,216
- Next man down the--
- What about the good leads?

243
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,635
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

244
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:09,554
They're old--
I've seen that name 100 times.

245
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,765
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

246
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,642
The new leads--
the Glengarry leads.

247
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:17,061
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

248
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:19,230
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

249
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:21,649
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

250
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,651
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

251
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:25,361
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

252
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,572
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

253
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:30,116
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

254
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:33,035
I suggest you-- those of you
who are interested

255
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,913
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

256
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:37,999
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

257
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:39,792
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

258
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:43,963
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

259
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:47,008
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

260
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:50,803
I-- I can't--
I can't close this stuff.

261
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,559
Shelly, how am I
supposed to--

262
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,312
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

263
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,907
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,368
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

265
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,371
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

266
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:20,541
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

267
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:24,170
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

268
00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:29,467
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

269
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,761
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

270
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,847
I have some rather--
rather unusual,

271
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:37,183
rather good information
on the property...

272
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:41,646
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

273
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:44,357
Please listen closely--
I only have a moment or so.

274
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:48,027
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

275
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:52,031
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:55,827
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

277
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,622
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

278
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,542
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

279
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,586
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

280
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,881
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

281
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:10,967
in our land
development plan.

282
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,679
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

283
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,890
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

284
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:22,395
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

285
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:25,022
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

286
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:27,233
with both you
and your husband?

287
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:29,902
Of course I'll hold.

288
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,752
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

289
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,336
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

290
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,589
They're ancient--
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

291
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,966
Get some jerk
to come in here--

292
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,844
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

293
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,305
Send a guy out there--
no support, no confidence.

294
00:19:57,346 --> 00:20:00,016
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

295
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,602
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma-- fuck Roma.

296
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,771
Had a freak--
a little run of luck.

297
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:07,273
The leads are garbage.

298
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:09,442
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

299
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:11,611
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

300
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:16,282
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

301
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:20,286
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

302
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:22,330
What is it?
I can't push through.

303
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,624
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

304
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:26,793
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

305
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,921
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

306
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:32,256
I can't close 'em.

307
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,512
Life.

308
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:39,806
I swear to God,
you work all your life--

309
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:43,976
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

310
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,479
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

311
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:50,108
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

312
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:51,859
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

313
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:53,820
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

314
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:56,239
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

315
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,033
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

316
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:00,660
- Nope.
- All this garbage--

317
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:02,203
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

318
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:05,581
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

319
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,833
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

320
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,376
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

321
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,002
and you know
who's responsible?

322
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:12,046
- Who?
- You know who it is.

323
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:14,006
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

324
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:16,092
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

325
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:18,177
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

326
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,388
he's got that list--
with the nurses?

327
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,149
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

328
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:33,568
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

329
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:36,237
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

330
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,739
- You see?
- Yes.

331
00:21:37,822 --> 00:21:40,783
For the leads-- that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

332
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:45,037
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

333
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:47,081
Who-- who's got
a steady job,

334
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:49,250
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

335
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,835
Nurses.

336
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,545
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand--

337
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:54,964
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

338
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,425
- He's going wild.
- He is?

339
00:21:57,508 --> 00:22:00,720
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

340
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:02,597
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

341
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,850
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

342
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,769
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

343
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:10,563
All that shit. Somebody told me--
you know what he's clearing, himself?

344
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:13,399
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

345
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:16,819
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

346
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:19,947
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

347
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:21,783
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

348
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:23,701
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

349
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:26,662
$0%%of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

350
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:30,166
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

351
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,210
What do you need?
A telephone?

352
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:35,421
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

353
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:37,799
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

354
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:40,676
You can't sell to a void--
you got to get a goddamn person.

355
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,304
You get a lead, you get
a person-- I'll go sell 'em.

356
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:45,181
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

357
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,268
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

358
00:22:49,352 --> 00:22:52,397
Yeah, we spoke--
last May I called you.

359
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,650
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and--

360
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,443
Arizona.

361
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:59,779
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

362
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:03,616
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value--

363
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:08,913
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $76,000.

364
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:11,457
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

365
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:14,127
Look, I'm here overnight--
I have to go home tomorrow,

366
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:18,047
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that--

367
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:22,009
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

368
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:25,138
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

369
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:29,267
and make sure--
oh, gee, I wish that--

370
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:34,313
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

371
00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:48,161
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

372
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,000
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

373
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,543
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

374
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:57,712
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

375
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:00,214
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

376
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,593
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

377
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:06,179
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

378
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,515
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy-- five minutes?

379
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:11,726
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

380
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:14,812
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

381
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:17,356
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract--

382
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,985
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

383
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:23,112
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

384
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:27,075
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

385
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:31,370
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

386
00:24:31,454 --> 00:24:34,040
You got the new leads.
If you would give me-- just hold on.

387
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:36,876
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

388
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:39,712
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads--

389
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:41,380
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

390
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:43,132
No, no-- hold on,
will you?

391
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:45,802
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

392
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,762
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

393
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:51,641
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

394
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,185
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

395
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:55,144
Shelly--

396
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,772
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

397
00:24:57,855 --> 00:25:00,066
I pray you never find it--
it runs in streaks.

398
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:03,027
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does-- streaks.

399
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:06,697
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

400
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:09,742
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson--

401
00:25:09,826 --> 00:25:13,955
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

402
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:17,750
1$87, '88, '8$--
six months in '8$-- who's on top?

403
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,293
- Roma.
- Under him?

404
00:25:19,293 --> 00:25:22,088
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

405
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:24,757
April to September it's me--
it's no fucking Moss.

406
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:27,176
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

407
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,930
Talk-- talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

408
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,182
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late--

409
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:35,643
Well, lately--
kiss my ass "lately."

410
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:38,396
You call Murray and you call Mitch--
when we were on Peterson,

411
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:41,107
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

412
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,277
He came in here--
"You bought that for me, fella."

413
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,281
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

414
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:50,575
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

415
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:53,161
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

416
00:25:53,244 --> 00:25:57,582
I can't get a lead, you--
it was skill, John.

417
00:25:57,665 --> 00:26:00,126
It could be working for you--
you want to throw it away.

418
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:02,378
- It isn't me.
- It's not you--

419
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:04,964
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

420
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:08,801
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

421
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:11,137
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

422
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:13,890
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

423
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:20,688
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

424
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,616
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

425
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:33,451
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

426
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:36,537
I do what I'm hired to do--
you might do the same.

427
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:38,498
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

428
00:26:40,124 --> 00:26:44,045
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

429
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:46,214
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

430
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:48,341
Marshal your sales force?

431
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,094
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

432
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,137
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

433
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:57,183
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

434
00:26:57,225 --> 00:26:59,560
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

435
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:01,229
You give me
one premium lead--

436
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:03,022
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

437
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:05,358
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

438
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,859
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

439
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:10,154
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

440
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:13,199
But I cannot sell shit!

441
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:15,868
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

442
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,870
Christ, I saw these back--
Homestead--

443
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:20,248
1$85, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

444
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:24,627
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

445
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,630
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

446
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,383
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

447
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:32,677
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

448
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,013
Hey, I need your help.

449
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:40,977
I can't do it,
Shelly.

450
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:48,526
John...

451
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:51,237
I'll give you 10%%.

452
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,906
- Of what?
- My end-- what I close.

453
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:56,909
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%%, what I close.

454
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:58,828
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

455
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,913
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

456
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:03,082
What if you don't,
you understand?

457
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:06,085
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

458
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:07,879
- You see what I'm saying?
- John--

459
00:28:07,962 --> 00:28:10,214
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

460
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:12,258
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

461
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,052
Now, 10%%John--
I can get hot, you know that.

462
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:17,680
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist-- fuck it!

463
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:20,683
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

464
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,436
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said--

465
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:25,938
"Attack."
Let's do something.

466
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,401
- Huh?
- 20%%.

467
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:34,447
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

468
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:36,491
- No?
- Oh!

469
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:45,124
Oh, shit.

470
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:02,892
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

471
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:07,855
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

472
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:11,234
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

473
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:14,028
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

474
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,323
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

475
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:20,785
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

476
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:25,706
John, a good deal-- has got to be
one where both parties--

477
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,001
Okay, okay, okay, fine--
20%%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

478
00:29:29,085 --> 00:29:31,003
Let's go out.
We make some money.

479
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:33,673
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

480
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:36,426
and I want the good leads--
the Glengarry leads-- two.

481
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,678
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

482
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:41,556
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

483
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:44,517
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

484
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,186
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

485
00:29:47,228 --> 00:29:51,149
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

486
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,901
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

487
00:29:53,985 --> 00:29:57,029
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

488
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:59,532
What?

489
00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:02,368
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

490
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,537
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

491
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:06,873
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

492
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:09,625
You fucking asshole.

493
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:12,962
I don't have it--
I don't--

494
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,381
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

495
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:17,842
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

496
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:22,972
I can't fucking
believe this.

497
00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:26,392
All right, here's...

498
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:28,269
20... 30, and--

499
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,898
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

500
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:34,192
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

501
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,069
No.

502
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,075
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

503
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:45,244
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

504
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:49,207
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray-- I got your job.

505
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:52,668
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

506
00:30:52,752 --> 00:30:57,548
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

507
00:30:57,632 --> 00:30:59,342
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

508
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,260
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

509
00:31:01,302 --> 00:31:05,848
Give me-- I'll take two more
of the old leads.

510
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:08,518
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

511
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,561
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly--

512
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:11,771
I promise you,
I've been on the phone-- I know.

513
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:13,523
No more leads today--
two per day. You've got yours.

514
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:15,608
All right.

515
00:31:15,691 --> 00:31:18,111
- All right?
- Sure.

516
00:31:23,324 --> 00:31:27,787
We will do that...
other thing.

517
00:31:29,497 --> 00:31:32,667
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

518
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,843
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

519
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:45,638
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

520
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,974
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

521
00:31:48,057 --> 00:31:50,309
- To get on the--
- To get on the board, yeah.

522
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:52,478
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

523
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,313
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

524
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:57,442
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

525
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:59,193
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

526
00:31:59,277 --> 00:32:01,529
These names come up--
you ever get 'em-- "Patel"?

527
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:04,574
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

528
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,951
You had one,
you'd know it-- "Patel."

529
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:08,661
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

530
00:32:08,745 --> 00:32:11,080
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

531
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:13,875
They like to feel superior--
never bought a fucking thing.

532
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:16,544
I don't know.
Come down the line--

533
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:21,090
doctors, lawyers, Indians--
times are tight. It's tight.

534
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:25,678
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

535
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,474
You go in the door-- I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

536
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:33,269
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

537
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,735
Remember when we were-- when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

538
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:43,071
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

539
00:32:43,154 --> 00:32:45,323
- They came in--
- They fucked it up.

540
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,366
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

541
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,744
- We're stuck with this--
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

542
00:32:49,827 --> 00:32:51,454
- This shit.
- It's too...

543
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:53,790
- It is.
- You get a bad month--

544
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:57,293
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

545
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,837
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

546
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:02,215
I know, it's-- hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

547
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:08,262
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

548
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:10,056
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

549
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:13,101
Guys come in-- "Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

550
00:33:13,184 --> 00:33:15,603
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

551
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:17,522
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

552
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:20,441
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life--

553
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:22,443
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots--

554
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:23,569
Boots, yes...

555
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:26,989
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

556
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,950
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

557
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:31,452
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

558
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:34,247
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

559
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:37,333
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

560
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,419
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

561
00:33:39,502 --> 00:33:41,379
Come in.

562
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:44,841
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

563
00:33:44,924 --> 00:33:47,552
Oh, "cats and dogs."

564
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:52,640
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

565
00:33:52,724 --> 00:33:55,435
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself-- many years.

566
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:58,312
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

567
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:03,067
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

568
00:34:03,151 --> 00:34:04,986
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?

569
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:07,113
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

570
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:09,115
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

571
00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:12,368
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

572
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:15,705
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization--

573
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:19,542
my representatives in this area--
and Mr. Spannel--

574
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,462
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

575
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:26,215
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

576
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:29,427
and he made me--
he made me an offer.

577
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,056
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan--

578
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:37,643
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

579
00:34:37,727 --> 00:34:40,980
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

580
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:44,150
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

581
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:47,403
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

582
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:50,448
How can you present
investment opportunities

583
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:52,700
without television,
without magazine ads?"

584
00:34:52,784 --> 00:34:54,702
I said, "You take
something this good,

585
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,996
you go to a man--
has invested in the past--

586
00:34:57,038 --> 00:35:00,917
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him-- rebate.

587
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,128
And don't give it
to this expert."

588
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:07,590
So you're here
to sell me some land?

589
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,842
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you--

590
00:35:09,926 --> 00:35:13,262
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

591
00:35:13,346 --> 00:35:16,099
I think something
has to be fed,

592
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:19,102
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

593
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:21,687
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

594
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,981
- Mister--
- Just call me Shelly.

595
00:35:24,065 --> 00:35:26,275
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

596
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:28,361
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the--

597
00:35:28,444 --> 00:35:30,863
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

598
00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:33,157
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone-- can't wait to meet her.

599
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:35,034
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

600
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:37,745
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

601
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:40,456
- I'm on a plane to Florida--
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

602
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,042
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

603
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:45,711
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

604
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:48,506
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

605
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:51,717
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

606
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:54,178
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

607
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:57,098
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

608
00:35:57,181 --> 00:36:00,101
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

609
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:04,731
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

610
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:07,066
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

611
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,985
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

612
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:12,905
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year--

613
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:15,950
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

614
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:17,785
No, no.
Do you understand?

615
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:20,872
Thank you. No.

616
00:36:36,637 --> 00:36:38,848
- Roma, man-- he don't care.
- He don't care.

617
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:42,351
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

618
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:44,812
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

619
00:36:44,896 --> 00:36:47,690
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

620
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:49,776
If they bounce you with no
confidence--

621
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,445
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

622
00:36:57,825 --> 00:37:00,286
If they get you
on a bad beat--

623
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:02,830
and you got to go out there,
get a new job--

624
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:04,665
- With no--
- With no confidence--

625
00:37:04,707 --> 00:37:06,292
Yes.

626
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:10,588
I'll tell you what the hard part is--
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

627
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:14,133
You say the Nazis
in Europe--
"If they came in my door"--

628
00:37:14,217 --> 00:37:16,594
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

629
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:18,971
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker--

630
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:21,516
wants to break your rice bowl.

631
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:25,144
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say-- fuck you!

632
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:28,022
Sitting on the good leads.

633
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:30,942
George, we're men here.

634
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,528
Yes.

635
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:37,532
And I'll tell you--
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

636
00:37:37,615 --> 00:37:40,201
- What?
- Starting up.

637
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:42,995
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

638
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,791
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

639
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:52,505
This is the difference--
listen to me, George.

640
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:54,715
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

641
00:37:54,799 --> 00:38:00,388
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

642
00:38:01,597 --> 00:38:04,600
I'll tell you-- I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

643
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:08,646
What?

644
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,357
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

645
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:13,735
Somebody should do something
to them.

646
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:16,028
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

647
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:17,947
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

648
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,699
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

649
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:21,659
- How?
- Someone should do something

650
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:23,453
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

651
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:26,706
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

652
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:30,251
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

653
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:33,379
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

654
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:35,381
and we go to Jerry Graff.

655
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:39,302
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

656
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:45,391
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

657
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:48,061
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

658
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:51,773
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

659
00:38:51,856 --> 00:38:53,858
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

660
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:56,611
I'd really like to get it
off the books before--

661
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:59,697
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

662
00:38:59,781 --> 00:39:02,283
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

663
00:39:02,366 --> 00:39:05,578
Now, I'm in town only for--
well, let me see.

664
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,623
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

665
00:39:08,664 --> 00:39:11,250
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

666
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,920
As I said,
I could swing by tonight--

667
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:16,464
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

668
00:39:16,547 --> 00:39:18,466
Grace, I'm gonna need

669
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:21,094
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

670
00:39:21,177 --> 00:39:23,429
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

671
00:39:23,513 --> 00:39:27,725
And put me
on the telex hookup-- yes?

672
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:31,270
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

673
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:34,774
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

674
00:39:34,857 --> 00:39:38,069
It gets so you don't
mind it.

675
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:41,280
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

676
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:43,950
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

677
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:50,164
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

678
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:53,292
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

679
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:56,838
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

680
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:59,465
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

681
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:01,509
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

682
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:05,638
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

683
00:40:05,722 --> 00:40:08,975
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

684
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:12,812
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

685
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:15,523
And then what?

686
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:19,152
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

687
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,155
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

688
00:40:22,238 --> 00:40:24,198
You think that,
act that way.

689
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,663
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

690
00:40:30,705 --> 00:40:32,707
That's me.

691
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,299
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

692
00:40:41,382 --> 00:40:44,010
- Did I...?
- Yes.

693
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:47,597
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

694
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:54,937
Great meals fade
in reflection.

695
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:57,690
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

696
00:40:57,774 --> 00:41:01,152
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

697
00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:03,654
keeps us going--
it's only food.

698
00:41:04,906 --> 00:41:07,200
The great fucks
you may have had,

699
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:09,243
what do you remember
about them?

700
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:13,372
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

701
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,876
I don't know.
For me,

702
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:20,421
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

703
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:25,885
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

704
00:41:25,968 --> 00:41:30,431
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

705
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,394
Or it's me in the--
I'm telling you--

706
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:38,439
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me café au lait,

707
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:41,943
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

708
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:43,528
Eh?

709
00:41:45,613 --> 00:41:47,949
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

710
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:53,371
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

711
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:57,250
That's it.
That's our life.

712
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,919
Where's the moment?

713
00:42:04,465 --> 00:42:07,427
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

714
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,387
Loss. What else?

715
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,600
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

716
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,272
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

717
00:42:19,313 --> 00:42:22,442
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

718
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:25,778
What could we get
for them?

719
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:28,614
- For them?
- For the leads.

720
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:30,700
What could we get
for the leads?

721
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:35,163
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

722
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:39,375
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

723
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:42,587
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

724
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,963
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

725
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:47,258
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

726
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:50,595
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

727
00:42:50,678 --> 00:42:52,930
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying-- yeah.

728
00:42:53,014 --> 00:42:55,600
A guy could take--
like anything else, it seems to me,

729
00:42:55,683 --> 00:42:58,186
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

730
00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:01,647
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

731
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:05,443
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

732
00:43:05,526 --> 00:43:07,612
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

733
00:43:07,695 --> 00:43:09,989
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

734
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:12,492
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

735
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:14,660
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

736
00:43:14,702 --> 00:43:17,497
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

737
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:20,333
As a robbery? No.

738
00:43:22,752 --> 00:43:25,004
- Well...
- Hey.

739
00:43:25,046 --> 00:43:27,840
So all this--
you didn't actually call Graff?

740
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:30,385
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

741
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:32,678
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

742
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:34,347
- Did you?
- What did I say?

743
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,224
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

744
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:38,476
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

745
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:39,852
- We are?
- Yes.

746
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:43,314
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

747
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:47,026
It is a crime.

748
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:52,532
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

749
00:43:52,573 --> 00:43:55,368
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

750
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,869
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

751
00:43:56,911 --> 00:43:58,704
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

752
00:43:58,788 --> 00:44:00,373
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

753
00:44:00,456 --> 00:44:02,250
What did he say?

754
00:44:05,461 --> 00:44:07,547
He'd buy them.

755
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:18,558
You're gonna steal--

756
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:21,811
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

757
00:44:21,894 --> 00:44:24,897
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

758
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:28,234
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

759
00:44:28,317 --> 00:44:31,904
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

760
00:44:31,988 --> 00:44:33,948
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

761
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,451
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

762
00:44:36,492 --> 00:44:40,747
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

763
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,124
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

764
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:45,960
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

765
00:44:46,043 --> 00:44:48,421
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

766
00:44:48,504 --> 00:44:50,590
He could take you on.
Yes.

767
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:14,781
Hello?

768
00:45:14,864 --> 00:45:17,283
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

769
00:45:17,325 --> 00:45:20,078
Sheldon Levene.
She's in--

770
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:24,707
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But-- where's the duty nurse?

771
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,295
They canceled her--
well, let me talk--

772
00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:31,380
who am I speaking to?

773
00:45:34,175 --> 00:45:37,428
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

774
00:45:38,012 --> 00:45:39,972
It's a big decision,
George.

775
00:45:40,056 --> 00:45:43,434
At times a guy
has got to make one.

776
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:45,603
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

777
00:45:45,686 --> 00:45:48,981
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

778
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:51,150
Yes.

779
00:45:51,234 --> 00:45:53,694
Sometimes a guy...

780
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:56,155
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward--

781
00:45:56,197 --> 00:45:58,783
That's absolutely right.

782
00:45:58,866 --> 00:46:00,827
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

783
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:05,498
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

784
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,624
What?

785
00:46:06,707 --> 00:46:08,668
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

786
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:10,962
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

787
00:46:11,045 --> 00:46:13,172
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

788
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:16,008
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

789
00:46:16,092 --> 00:46:19,053
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

790
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:20,847
It's when a chance
presents itself.

791
00:46:20,888 --> 00:46:22,515
You got to go
in there tonight.

792
00:46:22,598 --> 00:46:23,975
- You.
- I'm sorry?

793
00:46:24,058 --> 00:46:25,727
- You.
- Me?

794
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,854
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

795
00:46:27,937 --> 00:46:30,398
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

796
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,193
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

797
00:46:34,277 --> 00:46:36,446
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

798
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:39,782
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

799
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:42,869
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

800
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:45,913
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

801
00:46:45,955 --> 00:46:48,207
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

802
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:51,043
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

803
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:53,296
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

804
00:46:53,379 --> 00:46:54,672
Yes?

805
00:46:54,756 --> 00:46:56,841
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

806
00:46:56,924 --> 00:46:58,176
- Yes.
- No.

807
00:46:58,259 --> 00:46:59,844
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

808
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:04,348
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

809
00:47:04,432 --> 00:47:07,185
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

810
00:47:07,268 --> 00:47:09,729
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

811
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:12,231
Let me ask you this--
are you going to turn me in?

812
00:47:12,273 --> 00:47:14,108
What if you don't get caught?

813
00:47:14,192 --> 00:47:15,693
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

814
00:47:15,735 --> 00:47:17,779
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

815
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:19,614
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

816
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:21,699
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

817
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:23,576
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

818
00:47:23,618 --> 00:47:25,286
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

819
00:47:25,328 --> 00:47:30,374
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

820
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,086
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught--

821
00:47:33,169 --> 00:47:36,005
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

822
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:37,924
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

823
00:47:38,007 --> 00:47:40,093
- Why?
- Why?

824
00:47:40,134 --> 00:47:41,761
Are you going to give me $7,500?

825
00:47:41,803 --> 00:47:44,055
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

826
00:47:44,138 --> 00:47:47,100
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

827
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:50,144
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

828
00:47:50,228 --> 00:47:52,897
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

829
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,607
- Me.
- Absolutely.

830
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,983
That's ridiculous.

831
00:47:56,025 --> 00:47:57,902
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

832
00:47:57,944 --> 00:48:00,863
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

833
00:48:00,947 --> 00:48:03,574
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

834
00:48:03,658 --> 00:48:06,160
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

835
00:48:06,244 --> 00:48:08,871
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

836
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:12,166
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

837
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,127
Just in or out?
You tell me.

838
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,753
You're out,
you take the consequences.

839
00:48:15,837 --> 00:48:17,755
- I do?
- That's right.

840
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,799
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

841
00:48:20,174 --> 00:48:21,634
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

842
00:48:21,718 --> 00:48:24,303
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

843
00:48:24,387 --> 00:48:28,516
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have--

844
00:48:30,184 --> 00:48:33,646
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

845
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,023
- Huh?
- The thing.

846
00:48:36,107 --> 00:48:41,028
You really...
what do you keep?

847
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,865
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

848
00:48:43,948 --> 00:48:46,701
- No.
- Security.

849
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:49,370
Things. Things.

850
00:48:49,454 --> 00:48:51,831
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

851
00:48:51,914 --> 00:48:56,502
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

852
00:48:56,586 --> 00:48:58,004
You can't do it.

853
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:00,506
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

854
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:05,845
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

855
00:49:05,928 --> 00:49:09,390
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

856
00:49:09,432 --> 00:49:13,394
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

857
00:49:13,436 --> 00:49:16,939
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

858
00:49:17,023 --> 00:49:20,109
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

859
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:23,112
That's all they are.
They're an event.

860
00:49:23,196 --> 00:49:26,866
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

861
00:49:26,908 --> 00:49:29,702
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

862
00:49:29,744 --> 00:49:32,789
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

863
00:49:32,872 --> 00:49:34,999
You see what I'm saying?

864
00:49:37,627 --> 00:49:40,046
Things happen to you.

865
00:49:41,297 --> 00:49:43,925
Glad I met you.

866
00:49:44,008 --> 00:49:45,718
I'm glad I met you,
James.

867
00:49:47,845 --> 00:49:50,473
I want to show you
something.

868
00:49:50,556 --> 00:49:53,059
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

869
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:55,978
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

870
00:49:58,773 --> 00:50:01,818
What is that?
Florida.

871
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:04,737
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

872
00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:07,782
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

873
00:50:07,865 --> 00:50:10,993
And that's what I said.

874
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:13,579
But look at this.

875
00:50:13,663 --> 00:50:18,126
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

876
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,628
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

877
00:50:48,698 --> 00:50:50,783
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

878
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:53,453
I work, yes.
I work here.

879
00:50:53,536 --> 00:50:55,997
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

880
00:51:02,378 --> 00:51:06,466
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

881
00:51:09,177 --> 00:51:11,554
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

882
00:51:11,637 --> 00:51:13,473
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

883
00:51:13,514 --> 00:51:14,932
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

884
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:16,225
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

885
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:18,436
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

886
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:21,147
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

887
00:51:21,189 --> 00:51:23,566
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

888
00:51:23,649 --> 00:51:25,568
They got-- excuse me.

889
00:51:25,651 --> 00:51:27,653
Fuck.

890
00:51:27,737 --> 00:51:30,490
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

891
00:51:30,573 --> 00:51:33,493
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

892
00:51:33,534 --> 00:51:35,661
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

893
00:51:35,745 --> 00:51:38,289
They got-- listen to me.
They got some of them.

894
00:51:38,372 --> 00:51:41,000
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

895
00:51:41,084 --> 00:51:44,420
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

896
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:46,172
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

897
00:51:46,214 --> 00:51:50,676
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

898
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,054
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

899
00:51:53,137 --> 00:51:55,807
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

900
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,017
- So far--
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

901
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:01,354
They got some
of the contracts?

902
00:52:01,437 --> 00:52:04,649
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

903
00:52:04,732 --> 00:52:06,359
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

904
00:52:06,442 --> 00:52:10,113
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

905
00:52:10,196 --> 00:52:12,532
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

906
00:52:12,615 --> 00:52:14,575
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

907
00:52:14,617 --> 00:52:16,577
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

908
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,996
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

909
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,707
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

910
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:24,001
- I don't--
- I don't want to hear any shit.

911
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:27,046
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

912
00:52:27,088 --> 00:52:30,091
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

913
00:52:30,174 --> 00:52:33,136
- The robbery makes difficult--
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

914
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:35,847
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

915
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,058
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

916
00:52:39,142 --> 00:52:42,145
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

917
00:52:42,228 --> 00:52:45,148
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

918
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:48,735
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

919
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:02,039
"Recontact James Lingk.

920
00:53:02,123 --> 00:53:05,918
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

921
00:53:06,002 --> 00:53:08,504
When do you expect
her in?

922
00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:11,299
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

923
00:53:11,382 --> 00:53:14,469
She'll remember.
Just, just-- wait a minute!

924
00:53:14,552 --> 00:53:17,889
Just to say-- to thank her
for a wonderful time.

925
00:53:17,972 --> 00:53:20,433
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

926
00:53:20,475 --> 00:53:22,894
They should check
if we're insured.

927
00:53:25,229 --> 00:53:27,899
Uh-huh.

928
00:53:27,982 --> 00:53:30,902
"10:00 p.m., Octavia."

929
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:33,988
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

930
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:36,949
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

931
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:39,994
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

932
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,467
I-- you know,
they should be insured.

933
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:57,011
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

934
00:53:57,095 --> 00:53:59,597
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

935
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,308
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

936
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,185
That's right.
How are you?

937
00:54:04,268 --> 00:54:06,479
I'm fine.

938
00:54:06,562 --> 00:54:09,023
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

939
00:54:10,817 --> 00:54:14,028
Yes. Okay.
The board.

940
00:54:14,112 --> 00:54:16,614
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't--

941
00:54:18,908 --> 00:54:21,494
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't--

942
00:54:21,577 --> 00:54:23,996
What?
You can't do what?

943
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:26,833
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

944
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:30,586
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

945
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,880
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

946
00:54:32,964 --> 00:54:35,425
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

947
00:54:35,508 --> 00:54:36,843
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

948
00:54:36,926 --> 00:54:41,389
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

949
00:54:41,472 --> 00:54:43,725
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

950
00:54:43,808 --> 00:54:45,560
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

951
00:54:45,643 --> 00:54:49,397
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

952
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,109
- He said he filed--
- He filed the big one.

953
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:55,361
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

954
00:54:55,403 --> 00:54:57,905
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

955
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:02,910
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.

956
00:55:02,994 --> 00:55:05,580
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

957
00:55:05,663 --> 00:55:09,250
that would sap anyone's-- wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones?

958
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:12,170
- They stole--
- They stole...?

959
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:14,756
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

960
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:17,592
...when criminals come and they take--
they steal the phones?

961
00:55:17,675 --> 00:55:19,886
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

962
00:55:19,927 --> 00:55:22,555
they stole-- aw, Christ.

963
00:55:22,638 --> 00:55:26,893
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

964
00:55:26,934 --> 00:55:28,936
You think they're going to catch--
where are you going?

965
00:55:28,978 --> 00:55:31,147
Down the street.

966
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:37,153
- Where are you going?
- To the-- what do you fucking care?

967
00:55:37,236 --> 00:55:41,657
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

968
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:44,911
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

969
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:48,456
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

970
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:51,751
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

971
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:54,587
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

972
00:55:54,629 --> 00:55:56,881
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

973
00:55:56,964 --> 00:55:59,550
Great.
Give them to me.

974
00:55:59,634 --> 00:56:03,054
Bring them.
Come on.

975
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:08,101
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a--

976
00:56:08,142 --> 00:56:11,312
What am I going
to do all month?

977
00:56:11,396 --> 00:56:13,689
See, the thing
of it is,

978
00:56:13,773 --> 00:56:16,234
is were the leads insured?
You think?

979
00:56:16,317 --> 00:56:19,237
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

980
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,656
I don't know, why?

981
00:56:21,739 --> 00:56:23,616
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

982
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:26,077
- What?
- They'll be upset.

983
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,621
That's right.

984
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:30,915
You're right.

985
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:34,669
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

986
00:56:34,752 --> 00:56:36,295
- To...
- The cop.

987
00:56:36,379 --> 00:56:38,423
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

988
00:56:38,506 --> 00:56:42,176
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

989
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,178
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

990
00:56:44,262 --> 00:56:48,141
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.

991
00:56:48,182 --> 00:56:49,851
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

992
00:56:49,934 --> 00:56:51,686
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

993
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:53,271
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

994
00:56:55,523 --> 00:56:57,859
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

995
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,985
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

996
00:56:59,026 --> 00:57:00,153
- Where were you?
- At home.

997
00:57:00,194 --> 00:57:02,071
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

998
00:57:02,155 --> 00:57:03,197
- Was I?
- Yes.

999
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:05,491
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

1000
00:57:05,533 --> 00:57:07,660
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

1001
00:57:07,744 --> 00:57:10,455
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

1002
00:57:10,538 --> 00:57:13,082
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

1003
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:15,126
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

1004
00:57:15,168 --> 00:57:17,503
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

1005
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:19,589
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

1006
00:57:20,173 --> 00:57:23,176
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

1007
00:57:23,259 --> 00:57:25,720
"Ravidam Patel"?

1008
00:57:25,803 --> 00:57:27,597
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats?

1009
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,640
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm--

1010
00:57:29,724 --> 00:57:32,852
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

1011
00:57:32,935 --> 00:57:35,813
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

1012
00:57:35,897 --> 00:57:37,690
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

1013
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:40,568
to deadbeats--
money in the mattress.

1014
00:57:40,651 --> 00:57:43,154
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

1015
00:57:43,237 --> 00:57:45,406
I got to go out--
fuck this shit.

1016
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,283
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

1017
00:57:47,366 --> 00:57:49,410
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

1018
00:57:49,494 --> 00:57:51,704
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

1019
00:57:51,746 --> 00:57:54,749
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

1020
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:57,126
just in from out of town,"
all right?

1021
00:57:58,669 --> 00:58:01,672
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

1022
00:58:01,756 --> 00:58:04,217
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

1023
00:58:04,258 --> 00:58:06,511
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

1024
00:58:06,594 --> 00:58:09,597
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

1025
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,891
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

1026
00:58:11,974 --> 00:58:14,727
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

1027
00:58:14,811 --> 00:58:17,647
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

1028
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:20,316
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

1029
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,612
and figure out a way
to have your ass-- fuck you!

1030
00:58:24,695 --> 00:58:27,323
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

1031
00:58:31,786 --> 00:58:34,914
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

1032
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:36,833
Get the--
I did it-- I closed 'em.

1033
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:38,668
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

1034
00:58:38,751 --> 00:58:42,255
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

1035
00:58:42,338 --> 00:58:45,049
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

1036
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:49,178
- Rick-- eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

1037
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:51,597
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

1038
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:53,766
Who wants to go to lunch--
I'm buying.

1039
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:57,562
Williamson-- $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

1040
00:58:57,645 --> 00:58:59,897
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

1041
00:58:59,981 --> 00:59:02,608
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

1042
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:05,069
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

1043
00:59:05,153 --> 00:59:07,280
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

1044
00:59:07,363 --> 00:59:09,115
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

1045
00:59:09,198 --> 00:59:11,367
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

1046
00:59:11,451 --> 00:59:14,328
- Shelly!
- Big deal-- I broke a bad streak.

1047
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:16,622
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

1048
00:59:16,706 --> 00:59:18,624
Thank you, George.
Hey--

1049
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:21,127
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

1050
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,795
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

1051
00:59:22,837 --> 00:59:25,131
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

1052
00:59:25,173 --> 00:59:27,008
- We had a robbery.
- When?

1053
00:59:27,091 --> 00:59:29,802
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?

1054
00:59:32,597 --> 00:59:34,599
Fucking asshole.

1055
00:59:34,682 --> 00:59:36,809
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

1056
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:39,228
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

1057
00:59:39,312 --> 00:59:41,647
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

1058
00:59:41,731 --> 00:59:43,816
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

1059
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,778
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

1060
00:59:46,861 --> 00:59:49,155
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

1061
00:59:49,238 --> 00:59:51,282
- Anybody talks to this guy--
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

1062
00:59:51,365 --> 00:59:54,660
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

1063
00:59:54,744 --> 00:59:57,830
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

1064
00:59:57,914 --> 01:00:01,042
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

1065
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:03,503
Eight units,
Mountain View.

1066
01:00:03,544 --> 01:00:06,089
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1067
01:00:07,298 --> 01:00:09,425
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1068
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:11,094
- When?
- Just now.

1069
01:00:11,177 --> 01:00:13,471
- Guess who?
- You just-- this morning?

1070
01:00:13,554 --> 01:00:16,015
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1071
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:19,352
- You did that?
- Yeah-- $82,000.

1072
01:00:20,436 --> 01:00:23,981
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em-- listen to this.

1073
01:00:24,065 --> 01:00:27,235
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1074
01:00:27,318 --> 01:00:29,737
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1075
01:00:29,821 --> 01:00:32,198
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1076
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:37,120
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.

1077
01:00:37,203 --> 01:00:38,746
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.

1078
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,290
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1079
01:00:41,374 --> 01:00:43,960
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn--

1080
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:47,380
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1081
01:00:47,422 --> 01:00:49,924
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities?"'

1082
01:00:50,007 --> 01:00:52,593
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?

1083
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:54,470
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1084
01:00:54,554 --> 01:00:56,556
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.

1085
01:00:58,516 --> 01:01:00,184
Could we get
some coffee?

1086
01:01:00,268 --> 01:01:02,395
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1087
01:01:04,397 --> 01:01:05,565
Uh-huh.

1088
01:01:05,648 --> 01:01:07,567
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1089
01:01:09,944 --> 01:01:13,406
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1090
01:01:13,489 --> 01:01:15,783
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1091
01:01:16,284 --> 01:01:18,578
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?

1092
01:01:18,661 --> 01:01:20,788
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake--

1093
01:01:20,872 --> 01:01:23,082
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1094
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:25,418
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1095
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:27,295
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1096
01:01:27,378 --> 01:01:30,423
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1097
01:01:30,506 --> 01:01:33,342
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1098
01:01:33,426 --> 01:01:36,596
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1099
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:38,556
You bring that shit up--
on my volume?

1100
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:41,768
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1101
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:44,312
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1102
01:01:44,395 --> 01:01:46,773
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1103
01:01:46,814 --> 01:01:49,358
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1104
01:01:49,442 --> 01:01:52,779
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.

1105
01:01:52,862 --> 01:01:55,615
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think

1106
01:01:55,698 --> 01:01:57,283
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1107
01:01:57,366 --> 01:01:59,118
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1108
01:01:59,202 --> 01:02:01,704
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1109
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:04,665
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1110
01:02:04,749 --> 01:02:06,626
I get accused of--

1111
01:02:06,709 --> 01:02:10,380
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1112
01:02:10,463 --> 01:02:13,299
Is that what I did, Dave--
I humiliated you?

1113
01:02:13,383 --> 01:02:16,928
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1114
01:02:17,011 --> 01:02:19,847
Sitting on top of the world--
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1115
01:02:19,931 --> 01:02:23,142
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1116
01:02:23,226 --> 01:02:25,019
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1117
01:02:25,103 --> 01:02:26,896
Fuck you, Dave--
you know you got a big mouth.

1118
01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:30,191
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week--

1119
01:02:30,274 --> 01:02:34,612
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1120
01:02:34,695 --> 01:02:37,365
"Let me buy you a pack of gum--
I'll show you how to chew it."

1121
01:02:37,448 --> 01:02:40,410
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1122
01:02:40,493 --> 01:02:43,663
How fucked-up you are!

1123
01:02:43,704 --> 01:02:48,584
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1124
01:02:48,668 --> 01:02:52,004
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1125
01:02:52,046 --> 01:02:54,173
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1126
01:02:54,215 --> 01:02:56,843
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1127
01:02:56,926 --> 01:02:59,303
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1128
01:03:01,597 --> 01:03:03,850
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1129
01:03:05,935 --> 01:03:08,855
I never liked you,
anyway.

1130
01:03:08,938 --> 01:03:11,065
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1131
01:03:11,149 --> 01:03:13,526
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?

1132
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:15,445
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1133
01:03:15,528 --> 01:03:17,989
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1134
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,534
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1135
01:03:25,747 --> 01:03:27,540
You were saying?

1136
01:03:27,623 --> 01:03:30,334
Huh?

1137
01:03:30,418 --> 01:03:32,211
Come on.

1138
01:03:32,295 --> 01:03:34,547
Come on-- you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1139
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:37,258
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1140
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:39,635
you got
the stats spread out,

1141
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:42,972
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1142
01:03:43,056 --> 01:03:46,392
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1143
01:03:46,476 --> 01:03:49,604
- How was it?
- From the store.

1144
01:03:49,687 --> 01:03:52,231
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1145
01:03:52,315 --> 01:03:56,194
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1146
01:03:56,277 --> 01:03:59,697
and take it-- and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1147
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:01,574
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1148
01:04:01,657 --> 01:04:04,160
God, that's what
I've been saying-- the old ways.

1149
01:04:04,243 --> 01:04:07,747
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1150
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,707
They got their money
in government bonds--

1151
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:13,378
I said, "Fuck it-- let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1152
01:04:13,461 --> 01:04:17,757
I take it and plat it out-- eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1153
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:22,929
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1154
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:25,473
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1155
01:04:25,556 --> 01:04:28,768
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1156
01:04:28,851 --> 01:04:32,397
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce--
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1157
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,650
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1158
01:04:35,733 --> 01:04:38,945
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1159
01:04:39,028 --> 01:04:42,490
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me-- the both of us.

1160
01:04:42,532 --> 01:04:45,827
What is the point
of some interim position?

1161
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:49,497
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1162
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,625
And I mean it, that's it--
all eight units. Period."

1163
01:04:52,709 --> 01:04:55,294
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick-- hey.

1164
01:04:55,378 --> 01:05:00,216
I turned that contract around--
that's eight units, 82 grand--

1165
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:04,345
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1166
01:05:04,429 --> 01:05:07,432
I sat there five minutes.

1167
01:05:07,515 --> 01:05:12,937
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1168
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,815
Ricky-- not a word,
not a motion.

1169
01:05:15,857 --> 01:05:18,526
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1170
01:05:18,609 --> 01:05:21,446
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1171
01:05:21,529 --> 01:05:23,156
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1172
01:05:23,197 --> 01:05:25,324
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1173
01:05:25,366 --> 01:05:28,453
Nobody ever--
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1174
01:05:28,536 --> 01:05:30,580
No, what I did--
I locked on 'em.

1175
01:05:30,663 --> 01:05:33,291
I locked all on them--
nothing on me-- on them.

1176
01:05:33,374 --> 01:05:36,461
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1177
01:05:36,544 --> 01:05:39,172
"Now is the time."

1178
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:43,843
They signed.
It was great.

1179
01:05:43,926 --> 01:05:46,637
It was so fucking great.

1180
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:50,600
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1181
01:05:50,683 --> 01:05:53,311
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing-- just together.

1182
01:05:53,394 --> 01:05:58,483
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1183
01:05:58,566 --> 01:06:02,195
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1184
01:06:02,236 --> 01:06:04,363
passed it to her
and she signed.

1185
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:06,699
It was solemn--
fucking solemn.

1186
01:06:06,783 --> 01:06:11,788
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1187
01:06:11,871 --> 01:06:14,290
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1188
01:06:14,374 --> 01:06:16,584
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1189
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:18,669
He went over,
he brought us back a drink--

1190
01:06:18,753 --> 01:06:22,215
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1191
01:06:23,841 --> 01:06:27,470
And we just toasted
in silence.

1192
01:06:27,553 --> 01:06:31,015
Great sale, Shelly.

1193
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:33,101
Great.

1194
01:06:33,184 --> 01:06:36,104
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1195
01:06:36,187 --> 01:06:37,188
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1196
01:06:37,939 --> 01:06:39,899
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1197
01:06:39,982 --> 01:06:42,610
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1198
01:06:42,693 --> 01:06:45,321
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1199
01:06:45,405 --> 01:06:47,782
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele--

1200
01:06:47,865 --> 01:06:50,201
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1201
01:06:50,284 --> 01:06:53,204
We had a little-- you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1202
01:06:53,287 --> 01:06:56,165
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1203
01:06:56,249 --> 01:06:59,419
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make--

1204
01:06:59,502 --> 01:07:02,255
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1205
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:05,091
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1206
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:08,594
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1207
01:07:08,678 --> 01:07:10,972
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1208
01:07:11,055 --> 01:07:15,059
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1209
01:07:15,143 --> 01:07:16,978
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1210
01:07:17,061 --> 01:07:20,064
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1211
01:07:20,148 --> 01:07:22,233
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar--

1212
01:07:22,316 --> 01:07:24,110
you do not know how
to run this office.

1213
01:07:24,152 --> 01:07:26,571
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1214
01:07:26,654 --> 01:07:29,782
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1215
01:07:29,866 --> 01:07:32,618
- Did you ever sit--
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1216
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,620
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1217
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:36,622
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1218
01:07:36,664 --> 01:07:39,959
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1219
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:42,462
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1220
01:07:42,545 --> 01:07:45,214
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1221
01:07:45,298 --> 01:07:48,593
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1222
01:07:48,676 --> 01:07:52,013
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1223
01:07:52,096 --> 01:07:56,142
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1224
01:07:56,225 --> 01:07:58,394
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know--

1225
01:07:58,478 --> 01:08:01,147
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1226
01:08:01,189 --> 01:08:03,566
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1227
01:08:03,649 --> 01:08:05,568
For what,
two months, three months?

1228
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:08,613
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1229
01:08:08,696 --> 01:08:12,450
Luck-- was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?

1230
01:08:12,533 --> 01:08:14,327
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1231
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:17,955
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1232
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:21,417
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1233
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:24,170
Soft sell-- we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1234
01:08:24,253 --> 01:08:26,130
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1235
01:08:26,214 --> 01:08:30,051
You wouldn't know, you cock--
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1236
01:08:30,134 --> 01:08:32,512
What the hell are you?

1237
01:08:32,553 --> 01:08:35,306
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1238
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:38,768
That's my message to you--
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1239
01:08:38,851 --> 01:08:42,605
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1240
01:08:42,688 --> 01:08:44,524
Period. Fuck you.

1241
01:08:44,607 --> 01:08:47,777
Listen to me-- you put me
on that fucking board,

1242
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:50,321
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1243
01:08:50,405 --> 01:08:53,408
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1244
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:55,660
because I am
going to close them all.

1245
01:08:55,743 --> 01:08:58,955
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1246
01:09:00,289 --> 01:09:03,334
He's right, Williamson.

1247
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,215
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is?

1248
01:09:09,257 --> 01:09:10,842
Mitch and Murray.

1249
01:09:13,428 --> 01:09:16,180
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1250
01:09:16,264 --> 01:09:18,391
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1251
01:09:18,474 --> 01:09:21,853
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1252
01:09:21,936 --> 01:09:24,731
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

1253
01:09:24,772 --> 01:09:27,233
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1254
01:09:27,275 --> 01:09:29,986
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1255
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:31,821
I put her into it.

1256
01:09:31,904 --> 01:09:35,074
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1257
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:37,910
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1258
01:09:37,952 --> 01:09:41,706
- Take your time. If you still feel--
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1259
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:43,875
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1260
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:46,377
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1261
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:49,672
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1262
01:09:49,756 --> 01:09:52,800
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1263
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:55,762
- Are you acquainted with--
- Black Creek? No.

1264
01:09:55,845 --> 01:09:57,638
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1265
01:09:57,722 --> 01:10:00,892
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1266
01:10:00,975 --> 01:10:02,685
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1267
01:10:02,769 --> 01:10:05,521
Beautiful rolling land--
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1268
01:10:05,605 --> 01:10:08,983
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1269
01:10:09,067 --> 01:10:11,944
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1270
01:10:11,986 --> 01:10:13,863
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1271
01:10:13,946 --> 01:10:17,408
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services--

1272
01:10:17,492 --> 01:10:20,536
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted--

1273
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,413
I was at the Lingks'--

1274
01:10:22,497 --> 01:10:24,957
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1275
01:10:24,999 --> 01:10:26,709
- Which--
- "Home cooking."

1276
01:10:26,793 --> 01:10:29,629
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1277
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,297
"Home cook--"
the monthly interview.

1278
01:10:31,381 --> 01:10:33,549
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1279
01:10:33,633 --> 01:10:35,968
Is that something
I can talk about?

1280
01:10:36,052 --> 01:10:39,263
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1281
01:10:39,347 --> 01:10:40,973
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1282
01:10:41,057 --> 01:10:44,102
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1283
01:10:44,185 --> 01:10:46,229
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1284
01:10:46,312 --> 01:10:47,939
His wife.

1285
01:10:48,022 --> 01:10:50,608
Ray, what time
do you have?

1286
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:53,486
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1287
01:10:53,528 --> 01:10:55,321
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1288
01:10:55,405 --> 01:10:58,324
Remember the 1:00-- that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1289
01:10:58,408 --> 01:11:00,535
You're right, the 1:00--
let's scoot.

1290
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:02,745
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1291
01:11:02,829 --> 01:11:05,915
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle-- John!

1292
01:11:05,998 --> 01:11:09,502
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1293
01:11:09,585 --> 01:11:12,880
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1294
01:11:12,964 --> 01:11:15,425
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1295
01:11:15,508 --> 01:11:18,553
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and--

1296
01:11:18,636 --> 01:11:21,222
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1297
01:11:21,305 --> 01:11:25,143
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1298
01:11:25,226 --> 01:11:26,644
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1299
01:11:26,728 --> 01:11:28,229
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1300
01:11:28,312 --> 01:11:30,022
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1301
01:11:30,106 --> 01:11:33,025
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray--
just a minute.

1302
01:11:33,067 --> 01:11:37,613
Jim, I told you who he is-- the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1303
01:11:37,697 --> 01:11:39,866
His family owns 32 per--

1304
01:11:39,949 --> 01:11:43,870
over the past years, I have sold him--
I can't tell you the dollar amount--

1305
01:11:43,911 --> 01:11:46,581
but quite a lot of land.

1306
01:11:46,664 --> 01:11:50,126
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1307
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:52,712
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1308
01:11:52,795 --> 01:11:55,882
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1309
01:11:55,965 --> 01:12:00,178
It's funny-- you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1310
01:12:00,261 --> 01:12:02,722
all business--
this guy, I'll tell you.

1311
01:12:02,764 --> 01:12:04,724
We'll go to his house
someday.

1312
01:12:04,766 --> 01:12:08,936
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L.A.?

1313
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,355
Ah, Monday.

1314
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:13,775
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1315
01:12:13,858 --> 01:12:15,276
- My wife--
- Rick?

1316
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,654
I can't talk now, Jim--
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1317
01:12:18,738 --> 01:12:21,032
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1318
01:12:22,742 --> 01:12:25,286
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1319
01:12:25,369 --> 01:12:28,247
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1320
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:31,084
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1321
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:36,089
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1322
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:38,424
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again--

1323
01:12:38,466 --> 01:12:40,385
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1324
01:12:40,468 --> 01:12:43,137
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1325
01:12:43,221 --> 01:12:46,265
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1326
01:12:46,349 --> 01:12:50,103
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law--

1327
01:12:50,186 --> 01:12:54,524
the man next to you--
bought his lot at 42--

1328
01:12:54,607 --> 01:12:56,609
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1329
01:12:56,692 --> 01:12:58,361
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1330
01:12:58,444 --> 01:13:00,905
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1331
01:13:00,988 --> 01:13:04,283
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1332
01:13:04,367 --> 01:13:06,077
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1333
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,831
She called the consumer--
the attorney general?

1334
01:13:09,914 --> 01:13:12,291
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1335
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:15,461
The attorney ge--
it was some consumer office.

1336
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:18,965
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1337
01:13:19,006 --> 01:13:20,842
I don't know.

1338
01:13:20,925 --> 01:13:22,760
But they said
we have three days.

1339
01:13:22,844 --> 01:13:25,930
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1340
01:13:26,013 --> 01:13:28,015
Three days?

1341
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:32,145
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1342
01:13:32,228 --> 01:13:35,773
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1343
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:38,776
Of course you have--
three days.

1344
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:41,320
So we can't talk Monday.

1345
01:13:41,362 --> 01:13:43,990
Monday--
you saw my book.

1346
01:13:44,073 --> 01:13:46,659
Jim, Jim-- I can't.

1347
01:13:46,743 --> 01:13:48,619
You saw my book.
I can't.

1348
01:13:48,703 --> 01:13:50,747
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1349
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,832
Three business days,
they mean.

1350
01:13:52,915 --> 01:13:55,334
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1351
01:13:55,418 --> 01:13:58,671
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business--

1352
01:13:58,755 --> 01:14:00,840
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1353
01:14:00,923 --> 01:14:03,009
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1354
01:14:03,092 --> 01:14:05,762
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1355
01:14:05,845 --> 01:14:09,182
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1356
01:14:09,265 --> 01:14:13,936
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday--
so it would have elapsed.

1357
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,938
What would have elapsed?

1358
01:14:16,022 --> 01:14:17,774
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1359
01:14:17,857 --> 01:14:20,109
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1360
01:14:20,193 --> 01:14:21,861
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1361
01:14:21,944 --> 01:14:25,031
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1362
01:14:25,114 --> 01:14:27,492
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1363
01:14:27,533 --> 01:14:30,912
- I don't know.
- Today.

1364
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:34,207
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not--

1365
01:14:34,248 --> 01:14:37,377
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1366
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,462
It wasn't cashed?

1367
01:14:39,545 --> 01:14:41,714
I just phoned downtown--
it's on their desk.

1368
01:14:41,798 --> 01:14:43,966
- Rick.
- One moment.

1369
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:46,844
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1370
01:14:46,928 --> 01:14:48,930
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1371
01:14:49,013 --> 01:14:51,307
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1372
01:14:51,391 --> 01:14:55,353
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1373
01:14:55,436 --> 01:14:57,688
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1374
01:14:57,772 --> 01:14:59,732
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1375
01:14:59,774 --> 01:15:02,527
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1376
01:15:02,568 --> 01:15:04,445
from the time
the deal was closed."

1377
01:15:04,529 --> 01:15:06,489
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1378
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:08,741
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1379
01:15:08,783 --> 01:15:12,245
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1380
01:15:12,286 --> 01:15:14,580
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1381
01:15:14,664 --> 01:15:17,583
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1382
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:20,586
- I didn't rob--
- Shelly, get in the office.

1383
01:15:20,628 --> 01:15:23,756
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1384
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,593
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?

1385
01:15:27,677 --> 01:15:30,596
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1386
01:15:30,638 --> 01:15:34,142
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1387
01:15:34,225 --> 01:15:36,936
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1388
01:15:37,019 --> 01:15:38,771
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1389
01:15:38,813 --> 01:15:40,773
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1390
01:15:40,815 --> 01:15:43,067
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1391
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:45,069
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1392
01:15:45,153 --> 01:15:47,280
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1393
01:15:47,363 --> 01:15:49,490
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1394
01:15:49,574 --> 01:15:52,076
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1395
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,203
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1396
01:15:54,287 --> 01:15:56,581
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1397
01:15:56,622 --> 01:16:02,420
No man has the right--
no man has the right--

1398
01:16:02,503 --> 01:16:06,591
"Call an attorney"--
that means you're under--

1399
01:16:06,632 --> 01:16:08,593
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1400
01:16:08,634 --> 01:16:10,636
That's not--
as long as I've--

1401
01:16:10,678 --> 01:16:12,138
Will you get out of here?

1402
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,974
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1403
01:16:15,016 --> 01:16:17,977
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1404
01:16:18,061 --> 01:16:22,273
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1405
01:16:35,828 --> 01:16:37,997
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss...?

1406
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:41,209
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1407
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:43,586
Will you
excuse me, please?

1408
01:16:47,215 --> 01:16:49,759
I'm sorry, I--

1409
01:16:51,177 --> 01:16:54,514
I apologize to you. It's--

1410
01:16:54,597 --> 01:16:57,141
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1411
01:16:59,227 --> 01:17:01,020
What is it?

1412
01:17:01,062 --> 01:17:03,106
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1413
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:06,067
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again-- your wife?

1414
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:08,319
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1415
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:10,947
She wants her money back.

1416
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:12,782
We're gonna speak to her.

1417
01:17:12,865 --> 01:17:15,368
No, she told me,
"Right now."

1418
01:17:15,451 --> 01:17:17,829
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1419
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:19,706
- She--
- Roma!

1420
01:17:19,789 --> 01:17:23,334
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1421
01:17:23,418 --> 01:17:25,211
No. No.
This is something she said.

1422
01:17:25,253 --> 01:17:27,672
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1423
01:17:27,714 --> 01:17:29,882
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1424
01:17:29,966 --> 01:17:31,676
Listen, I do--
if I don't get my money back--

1425
01:17:31,718 --> 01:17:33,636
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1426
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,557
Listen-- will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1427
01:17:37,598 --> 01:17:40,852
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1428
01:17:40,893 --> 01:17:42,437
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1429
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,398
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1430
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,068
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1431
01:17:49,152 --> 01:17:52,530
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1432
01:17:54,824 --> 01:17:56,826
This is me!

1433
01:17:56,909 --> 01:18:00,663
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1434
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:06,002
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1435
01:18:06,085 --> 01:18:08,546
Understand?
This is me.

1436
01:18:08,629 --> 01:18:11,090
Something upset you.

1437
01:18:11,132 --> 01:18:13,426
Yes.
Sit down now.

1438
01:18:13,509 --> 01:18:17,430
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1439
01:18:17,472 --> 01:18:20,850
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1440
01:18:20,933 --> 01:18:22,977
You're goddamned
right I am.

1441
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:25,563
Sit down.

1442
01:18:25,646 --> 01:18:28,232
I'll tell you something,

1443
01:18:28,316 --> 01:18:33,112
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1444
01:18:36,074 --> 01:18:38,659
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1445
01:18:42,872 --> 01:18:45,541
I can't negotiate.

1446
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:48,878
What does that mean?

1447
01:18:50,171 --> 01:18:52,632
What?

1448
01:18:54,509 --> 01:18:56,594
What?
Say the words.

1449
01:18:56,677 --> 01:18:59,472
I don't have the power.

1450
01:18:59,514 --> 01:19:01,599
Okay, I said it.

1451
01:19:01,682 --> 01:19:05,103
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1452
01:19:05,186 --> 01:19:07,146
To negotiate what?

1453
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,359
To negotiate what?

1454
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:13,277
This.

1455
01:19:13,361 --> 01:19:15,446
- What this?
- The deal.

1456
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:17,407
The deal?

1457
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:19,450
Forget the deal, Jim.

1458
01:19:19,534 --> 01:19:22,495
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1459
01:19:22,578 --> 01:19:25,248
What?

1460
01:19:27,542 --> 01:19:29,877
I can't talk to you.

1461
01:19:29,961 --> 01:19:32,422
You met my wife.

1462
01:19:32,505 --> 01:19:35,425
- What?
- Aw...

1463
01:19:37,635 --> 01:19:39,762
I met your wife,
what?

1464
01:19:43,891 --> 01:19:46,185
What, Jim?

1465
01:19:48,187 --> 01:19:50,648
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1466
01:19:50,732 --> 01:19:51,941
Get a drink,
come on.

1467
01:19:52,024 --> 01:19:54,193
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1468
01:19:54,277 --> 01:19:56,154
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1469
01:19:56,195 --> 01:19:57,780
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1470
01:19:57,864 --> 01:19:59,866
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise--

1471
01:19:59,949 --> 01:20:01,993
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1472
01:20:02,035 --> 01:20:05,538
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1473
01:20:05,621 --> 01:20:07,999
Am I talking
about the deal?

1474
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:10,418
That's over.

1475
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:13,171
Please--
let's talk about you.

1476
01:20:19,761 --> 01:20:22,513
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1477
01:20:22,597 --> 01:20:24,891
Your life is your own.

1478
01:20:26,768 --> 01:20:28,936
You have a contract
with your wife,

1479
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:32,023
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1480
01:20:32,106 --> 01:20:35,276
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1481
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:41,365
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1482
01:20:41,449 --> 01:20:44,035
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1483
01:20:44,077 --> 01:20:48,289
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1484
01:20:48,373 --> 01:20:51,542
This is your life.

1485
01:20:56,798 --> 01:20:58,633
Yes?

1486
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,806
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1487
01:21:04,889 --> 01:21:07,892
and that concerns me.

1488
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:10,395
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1489
01:21:10,478 --> 01:21:12,188
Let's go, come on.

1490
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:14,524
Roma.

1491
01:21:14,607 --> 01:21:17,318
- What?
- The check, it's--

1492
01:21:18,778 --> 01:21:20,947
What did I tell you?

1493
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,907
No, what did I tell you
about the three days?

1494
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:24,909
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1495
01:21:25,284 --> 01:21:29,414
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1496
01:21:29,497 --> 01:21:33,418
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1497
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:37,296
- People downtown said--
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1498
01:21:37,338 --> 01:21:39,424
Yes?

1499
01:21:39,507 --> 01:21:41,551
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the--

1500
01:21:41,634 --> 01:21:44,387
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be--

1501
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:47,056
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1502
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:50,935
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1503
01:21:50,977 --> 01:21:53,146
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1504
01:21:53,229 --> 01:21:55,606
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1505
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:57,567
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John--

1506
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:59,444
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1507
01:21:59,527 --> 01:22:01,446
- Mr. Williamson--
- The check was cashed.

1508
01:22:01,529 --> 01:22:04,157
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1509
01:22:04,198 --> 01:22:06,617
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1510
01:22:06,701 --> 01:22:10,788
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1511
01:22:10,872 --> 01:22:13,666
- Though I'm sure we can--
- Not to my knowledge.

1512
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:17,003
Christ! I--
Oh, Christ.

1513
01:22:17,086 --> 01:22:19,547
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1514
01:22:22,133 --> 01:22:24,761
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1515
01:22:24,844 --> 01:22:28,097
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I--

1516
01:22:29,432 --> 01:22:32,185
I don't--
I don't know anymore.

1517
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:38,316
I... forgive me.

1518
01:22:52,205 --> 01:22:54,957
You stupid fucking cunt.

1519
01:22:56,334 --> 01:22:58,461
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1520
01:22:58,544 --> 01:23:01,172
You just cost me
$6,000.

1521
01:23:01,214 --> 01:23:07,804
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1522
01:23:07,887 --> 01:23:10,223
What are you gonna
do about it?

1523
01:23:10,306 --> 01:23:14,852
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1524
01:23:14,936 --> 01:23:16,854
You're fucking shit.

1525
01:23:16,938 --> 01:23:19,315
Where did you
learn your trade,

1526
01:23:19,399 --> 01:23:22,235
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1527
01:23:22,276 --> 01:23:24,737
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1528
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:26,197
Could I...?

1529
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,741
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1530
01:23:28,783 --> 01:23:31,536
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1531
01:23:31,577 --> 01:23:35,623
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1532
01:23:35,707 --> 01:23:38,710
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1533
01:23:38,793 --> 01:23:41,129
you're going out.
I swear to you--

1534
01:23:41,212 --> 01:23:43,840
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1535
01:23:45,842 --> 01:23:49,345
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits--

1536
01:23:49,429 --> 01:23:52,140
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1537
01:23:54,851 --> 01:23:58,521
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1538
01:23:58,604 --> 01:24:01,399
Does that seem
clear to you?

1539
01:24:01,441 --> 01:24:06,320
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1540
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:09,574
To help men who are
going out there

1541
01:24:09,615 --> 01:24:13,119
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1542
01:24:13,202 --> 01:24:14,954
You company man.

1543
01:24:14,996 --> 01:24:17,999
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1544
01:24:18,082 --> 01:24:21,586
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1545
01:24:26,591 --> 01:24:28,968
You wanna learn
the first rule

1546
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:32,013
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1547
01:24:32,096 --> 01:24:37,477
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1548
01:24:39,312 --> 01:24:42,023
You fucking child.

1549
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:57,372
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1550
01:24:59,248 --> 01:25:02,377
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1551
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:05,630
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1552
01:25:05,671 --> 01:25:07,507
Yes, I hear you.

1553
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:10,718
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1554
01:25:10,802 --> 01:25:13,012
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1555
01:25:13,054 --> 01:25:15,056
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1556
01:25:15,139 --> 01:25:18,393
Precisely.
Because your partner depends--

1557
01:25:18,476 --> 01:25:20,395
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1558
01:25:20,478 --> 01:25:21,562
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1559
01:25:21,646 --> 01:25:24,065
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1560
01:25:24,148 --> 01:25:27,485
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1561
01:25:27,527 --> 01:25:29,821
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1562
01:25:29,862 --> 01:25:31,572
"Hey, maybe the guy--"
oh, fuck it.

1563
01:25:31,656 --> 01:25:34,659
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1564
01:25:34,701 --> 01:25:37,286
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1565
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:40,331
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1566
01:25:40,373 --> 01:25:42,625
You are shit--
you can't exist alone.

1567
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:44,544
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1568
01:25:44,585 --> 01:25:47,714
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1569
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:49,841
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1570
01:25:49,924 --> 01:25:52,009
because you didn't
know the shot.

1571
01:25:52,093 --> 01:25:54,387
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1572
01:25:54,429 --> 01:25:57,390
I don't know what--
if you can't take something from that,

1573
01:25:57,473 --> 01:26:00,309
then you're-- scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1574
01:26:00,393 --> 01:26:03,396
A child would know it,
he's right.

1575
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:06,691
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1576
01:26:06,733 --> 01:26:09,736
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1577
01:26:09,777 --> 01:26:12,572
I'm done with you.

1578
01:26:25,126 --> 01:26:26,711
How do you know
I made it up?

1579
01:26:26,794 --> 01:26:29,130
What?

1580
01:26:29,213 --> 01:26:32,133
How do you know
I made it up?

1581
01:26:32,216 --> 01:26:34,719
What are you
talking about, huh?

1582
01:26:37,388 --> 01:26:40,433
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1583
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:47,106
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?

1584
01:26:54,405 --> 01:26:57,158
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1585
01:26:57,241 --> 01:26:59,452
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1586
01:27:03,164 --> 01:27:05,124
No, it hadn't.

1587
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:09,379
Don't fuck with me.

1588
01:27:09,462 --> 01:27:11,881
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1589
01:27:11,964 --> 01:27:14,717
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1590
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,889
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1591
01:27:19,972 --> 01:27:22,225
last night I didn't.

1592
01:27:23,643 --> 01:27:26,771
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1593
01:27:28,773 --> 01:27:31,150
How did you know that?

1594
01:27:33,152 --> 01:27:37,990
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1595
01:27:38,074 --> 01:27:40,493
No one knew that but you.

1596
01:27:41,786 --> 01:27:43,538
Now, how did you know that?

1597
01:27:43,621 --> 01:27:47,208
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1598
01:27:47,291 --> 01:27:48,751
Because this is my job!

1599
01:27:48,835 --> 01:27:52,672
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1600
01:27:52,755 --> 01:27:55,758
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1601
01:27:55,842 --> 01:27:58,386
You are so full of shit!

1602
01:27:58,469 --> 01:28:00,805
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1603
01:28:00,847 --> 01:28:02,974
Oh sure! You asshole.

1604
01:28:03,057 --> 01:28:04,892
What did you do
with the leads?

1605
01:28:04,976 --> 01:28:07,687
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1606
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:10,398
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1607
01:28:10,481 --> 01:28:13,860
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?

1608
01:28:13,943 --> 01:28:17,113
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1609
01:28:17,196 --> 01:28:19,532
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1610
01:28:19,574 --> 01:28:21,951
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1611
01:28:22,035 --> 01:28:24,412
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1612
01:28:24,495 --> 01:28:27,623
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1613
01:28:27,707 --> 01:28:29,125
Now, where are the leads?

1614
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:31,252
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1615
01:28:31,335 --> 01:28:32,962
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1616
01:28:33,046 --> 01:28:35,506
I don't care,
you understand?

1617
01:28:36,716 --> 01:28:39,260
Where are the leads?

1618
01:28:40,678 --> 01:28:42,764
All right.

1619
01:28:44,724 --> 01:28:46,684
I sold them.

1620
01:28:55,651 --> 01:28:58,154
To Jerry Graff.

1621
01:28:58,237 --> 01:29:00,531
How much did you
get for them?

1622
01:29:00,573 --> 01:29:02,450
How much did
you get for them?

1623
01:29:02,533 --> 01:29:04,869
Five.
Five grand.

1624
01:29:04,911 --> 01:29:07,789
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1625
01:29:07,872 --> 01:29:09,874
Do I have to tell you?

1626
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:12,460
Moss.

1627
01:29:16,089 --> 01:29:18,132
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1628
01:29:18,216 --> 01:29:20,718
- His idea.
- Was it?

1629
01:29:20,802 --> 01:29:23,054
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1630
01:29:23,096 --> 01:29:26,432
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1631
01:29:26,474 --> 01:29:28,726
Mmm.

1632
01:29:30,269 --> 01:29:31,938
Wait a minute.
Okay-- hey, hey, John!

1633
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:35,191
Wait-- okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1634
01:29:35,274 --> 01:29:38,778
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1635
01:29:40,947 --> 01:29:42,699
Eh, John?

1636
01:29:42,782 --> 01:29:45,034
Last night...

1637
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:47,787
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."

1638
01:29:47,829 --> 01:29:50,790
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1639
01:29:50,832 --> 01:29:54,127
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1640
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:58,339
Hey-- put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1641
01:29:58,423 --> 01:30:00,883
What it taught me--
you gotta get out there!

1642
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:04,303
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1643
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:07,181
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1644
01:30:07,265 --> 01:30:11,227
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1645
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:13,896
But whatever it takes, John,

1646
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:16,482
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1647
01:30:16,566 --> 01:30:19,152
We are going
to make it right.

1648
01:30:22,572 --> 01:30:24,365
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1649
01:30:24,449 --> 01:30:28,119
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1650
01:30:28,161 --> 01:30:30,705
What?

1651
01:30:30,788 --> 01:30:32,498
You've got a big mouth!

1652
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:35,293
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1653
01:30:35,334 --> 01:30:37,211
Where are you going?

1654
01:30:37,295 --> 01:30:40,006
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1655
01:30:40,089 --> 01:30:42,341
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1656
01:30:44,093 --> 01:30:47,597
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1657
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,016
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1658
01:30:50,099 --> 01:30:53,019
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1659
01:30:53,061 --> 01:30:57,023
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take--

1660
01:30:57,065 --> 01:31:00,526
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1661
01:31:00,568 --> 01:31:02,862
Wait, John.

1662
01:31:02,945 --> 01:31:06,449
John-- okay.

1663
01:31:09,243 --> 01:31:13,664
This is what
we're gonna do-- 20%%.

1664
01:31:13,706 --> 01:31:16,918
I'm gonna give you 20%%
of all my sales.

1665
01:31:17,001 --> 01:31:19,921
20%%, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1666
01:31:20,004 --> 01:31:22,006
50.

1667
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:26,552
- 50%%of all my sales.
- What sales?

1668
01:31:26,594 --> 01:31:28,763
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1669
01:31:28,846 --> 01:31:31,974
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1670
01:31:32,058 --> 01:31:34,519
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1671
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,563
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg--
do you want to see the memos?

1672
01:31:37,605 --> 01:31:41,192
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week--

1673
01:31:41,275 --> 01:31:43,820
when I was with Webb--
we were selling Arizona.

1674
01:31:43,903 --> 01:31:45,947
They're nuts.

1675
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:51,411
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1676
01:31:51,452 --> 01:31:53,413
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1677
01:31:53,496 --> 01:31:55,707
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1678
01:31:55,748 --> 01:31:58,126
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1679
01:31:58,209 --> 01:32:00,086
The check is no good?
They're nuts?

1680
01:32:00,169 --> 01:32:02,004
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1681
01:32:02,088 --> 01:32:05,758
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1682
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,594
The people are insane.

1683
01:32:10,054 --> 01:32:13,474
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1684
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,734
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1685
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:29,282
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1686
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:38,041
My daughter.

1687
01:32:38,124 --> 01:32:40,293
Fuck you.

1688
01:32:55,475 --> 01:32:57,852
Asshole.

1689
01:32:57,935 --> 01:33:01,105
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1690
01:33:03,274 --> 01:33:05,651
What a day.

1691
01:33:05,735 --> 01:33:07,737
Whoo...

1692
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:10,281
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1693
01:33:13,826 --> 01:33:17,497
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1694
01:33:19,999 --> 01:33:23,586
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1695
01:33:26,089 --> 01:33:28,800
It is not
a world of men, "Machine."

1696
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:31,677
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1697
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:34,347
bureaucrats...

1698
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:37,183
officeholders, what it is.

1699
01:33:38,226 --> 01:33:40,520
It's a fucked-up world.

1700
01:33:42,855 --> 01:33:44,857
No adventure to it.

1701
01:33:44,899 --> 01:33:49,195
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1702
01:33:50,863 --> 01:33:54,617
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's-- that's--

1703
01:33:54,701 --> 01:33:58,454
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1704
01:33:58,538 --> 01:34:00,873
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1705
01:34:00,957 --> 01:34:03,251
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time--

1706
01:34:03,334 --> 01:34:07,213
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"--

1707
01:34:07,296 --> 01:34:10,717
there's a man
I would work with.

1708
01:34:10,758 --> 01:34:14,512
There's--" you know,
I never said a word.

1709
01:34:14,554 --> 01:34:17,515
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1710
01:34:17,557 --> 01:34:21,394
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today--

1711
01:34:21,477 --> 01:34:25,648
that was so good.
That-- it--

1712
01:34:25,732 --> 01:34:28,526
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1713
01:34:28,568 --> 01:34:31,154
That was admirable.

1714
01:34:31,237 --> 01:34:33,906
It was the old stuff.

1715
01:34:33,948 --> 01:34:37,535
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1716
01:34:37,577 --> 01:34:41,330
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1717
01:34:43,416 --> 01:34:45,585
- You eat today?
- Me?

1718
01:34:45,668 --> 01:34:47,170
Yeah.

1719
01:34:47,253 --> 01:34:50,590
Want to swing around the Chinks'--
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1720
01:34:50,673 --> 01:34:53,009
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1721
01:34:53,092 --> 01:34:55,053
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1722
01:34:55,094 --> 01:34:57,221
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1723
01:34:57,263 --> 01:35:00,224
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1724
01:35:00,266 --> 01:35:02,894
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1725
01:35:02,935 --> 01:35:05,188
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1726
01:35:05,271 --> 01:35:07,690
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1727
01:35:07,774 --> 01:35:11,611
- Mr. Levene?
- ...so I only have that one lot left.

1728
01:35:11,652 --> 01:35:13,488
Would you come in here,
please?

1729
01:35:13,571 --> 01:35:15,948
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1730
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:18,451
so if you or your husband
are truly interested--

1731
01:35:18,493 --> 01:35:20,953
because I can't hold
this parcel past--

1732
01:35:21,037 --> 01:35:23,539
Yes?

1733
01:35:23,623 --> 01:35:26,584
Well, what would be better
for you-- say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1734
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:32,090
Go ask him. Shel-- we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1735
01:35:32,173 --> 01:35:34,133
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1736
01:35:34,175 --> 01:35:36,302
- I...
- Get in the room.

1737
01:35:36,386 --> 01:35:40,306
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."

1738
01:35:40,348 --> 01:35:43,393
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1739
01:35:43,476 --> 01:35:45,812
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1740
01:35:45,895 --> 01:35:48,064
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky--

1741
01:35:48,147 --> 01:35:49,982
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is--

1742
01:35:50,066 --> 01:35:52,110
What do you want?
You want to what?

1743
01:35:52,193 --> 01:35:56,114
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1744
01:35:57,532 --> 01:36:02,370
8:00 p.m.
6$47 Euclid.

1745
01:36:02,453 --> 01:36:05,164
Not at all--
thank you very much.

1746
01:36:15,842 --> 01:36:19,095
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1747
01:36:19,178 --> 01:36:22,348
No. I don't know.

1748
01:36:27,186 --> 01:36:29,272
Did the leads
come in yet?

1749
01:36:29,355 --> 01:36:31,816
No.

1750
01:36:39,699 --> 01:36:41,993
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1751
01:36:42,035 --> 01:36:44,162
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1752
01:36:49,709 --> 01:36:52,545
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1753
01:36:52,587 --> 01:36:55,840
Yes-- you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties?
