1
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:51,456
Darling, don't be difficult.
Let's take our sweet...

2
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,831
lovely children on an outing.

3
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:09,831
You can't do this.
I know my rights.

4
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:12,539
I have the authority to close
you down, and I'm doing just that.

5
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:17,122
This exhibit degrades everybody who
sees it and the creature himself.

6
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:20,456
He is a freak!
How else will he live?

7
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,789
Freaks are one thing.
This is entirely different.

8
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:27,206
This is monstrous
and should not be allowed.

9
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,914
These officers will see to it
you're on your way soon. Good day!

10
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:35,789
Move along please.

11
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,456
Hold it there, sir.

12
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,539
Come this way.

13
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,164
On the move again...

14
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:02,664
my treasure.

15
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:43,206
We'll be seeing a lot more
of these machine accidents...

16
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:45,081
- Mr. Hodges.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:53,664
Abominable things, these machines.
You can't reason with them.

18
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,747
What a mess!

19
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:03,122
Pull on the rope.

20
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:06,081
Irons, please.

21
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,414
Who is it?

22
00:08:22,872 --> 00:08:25,914
- Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

23
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:29,914
- I found it.
- Good. Did you see it?

24
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:36,456
All right. I'll see you
in a moment. Thank you.

25
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:41,497
Who's that?

26
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,956
- A friend of mine.
- Oh, yes.

27
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,372
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

28
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:50,622
Come on, Freddie!

29
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,081
Nothing of any importance.

30
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,456
Can you tell me
where Cleeves Street is?

31
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:53,956
'Round back, to the left,
then to the right. Straight through.

32
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,456
Thank you.

33
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:15,622
Are you the proprietor?

34
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:18,289
And who might you be, sir?

35
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:21,372
Just one of the curious.
I'd like to see it.

36
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:27,581
I don't think so.
No, sir, we're...

37
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,831
closed.

38
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,831
Now, I'd pay handsomely
for a private showing.

39
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,831
Are you the proprietor?

40
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:37,914
Handsomely?
Who sent you?

41
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,622
- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind.

42
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:47,331
I'm the owner.

43
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:09,997
Life...

44
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:15,747
is full of surprises.

45
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:22,956
Consider the fate...

46
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,831
of this creature's poor mother...

47
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,122
struck down...

48
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:33,247
in the fourth month
of her maternal condition...

49
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:36,706
by an elephant,
a wild elephant.

50
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:38,747
Struck down...

51
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:44,539
on an uncharted African isle.

52
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,289
The result...

53
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,331
is plain to see.

54
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:55,831
Ladies and gentlemen...

55
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:59,206
the terrible...

56
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:03,956
Elephant Man!

57
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:20,581
- Stand up.
- Stand up!

58
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:28,581
Turn around.

59
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:31,414
Turn around! Turn around!

60
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,456
Yes...

61
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,289
you'll bring him to me
tomorrow morning at 10:00, Mr...

62
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:20,164
Bytes.

63
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:22,664
He'll be there.

64
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,206
Good.

65
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:30,122
Here's my card,
and I'll send a cab.

66
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:31,664
All right?

67
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:34,247
We have a deal.

68
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:39,081
We understand each other.

69
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:43,622
More than money has changed hands.

70
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:46,914
We understand each other
completely, my friend.

71
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:49,289
Yes, well, thank you, Mr. Bytes.

72
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:52,247
Tomorrow.

73
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:31,372
Cor! What a stink!

74
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:35,122
I'm looking
for Mr. Frederick Treves...

75
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:37,081
please, ma'am.

76
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,331
Very well.
I'll-I'll send for him.

77
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:45,581
Nurse...
Oh, Mr. Treves, sir, this...

78
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:48,247
- This...
- Yes. Thank you.

79
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:50,331
Yes, I was expecting him.

80
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:54,122
- Yes, are you the cab driver?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:57,789
- Anyone else with you?
- No, sir. Just this gentleman.

82
00:16:57,872 --> 00:17:00,331
- Thank you for your troubles.
- Not at all, sir.

83
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:01,914
My pleasure.

84
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:04,414
Thank you.

85
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:08,206
Will you come this way, please?

86
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:12,956
Mrs. Mothershead, I'll be in my
room, and I'm not to be disturbed.

87
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,664
- All right?
- Of course, sir.

88
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,747
Will you come with me, please?

89
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,706
You heard what the doctor said!

90
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:33,247
Go on.

91
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:14,081
My name is Frederick Treves...

92
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:17,331
and I'm a surgeon here
at the London Hospital.

93
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:18,872
And...

94
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:24,747
I lecture in anatomy
at the medical college.

95
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,372
I'd like very much
to examine you so that...

96
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:37,081
Would that be all right?

97
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:39,914
Please.

98
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,747
First I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

99
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:49,997
Would that be all right?

100
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:55,081
Your owner tells me... I mean the man
who looks after you tells me...

101
00:18:55,164 --> 00:19:00,081
that you're English
and your name is John Merrick.

102
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:04,247
John Merrick.
Is that right?

103
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:12,122
I tell you what.
I think I'll ask you a question...

104
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:15,664
and you shake your head
like this for "no."

105
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:20,706
Have you always been
the way you are now?

106
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,581
Are you in any pain?

107
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:29,789
Are your parents still alive?

108
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:32,247
Do you understand me?

109
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:35,622
Your father and your mother,
are they dead?

110
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,372
Freddie, what are you doing for...

111
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:43,581
Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.
I had no idea you had...

112
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,622
Freddie, what the hell
have you got in there?

113
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:50,039
You'll know soon enough,
at the meeting of the Society.

114
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,956
Until then, I beg of you
not a word to anyone, please.

115
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:56,331
All right, if you insist. But you
must have quite a find in there.

116
00:19:56,456 --> 00:20:00,122
- I don't know what I've got.
- Nothing of any importance, eh?

117
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:04,747
Not a word, please, Fox.
Not a word.

118
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,456
All right.

119
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:14,872
Thank you.

120
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:47,289
It's all right.

121
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:01,747
I think I'll examine you now.

122
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:06,122
I'll leave the questions
till later.

123
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:07,664
All right?

124
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:11,872
Will you take
your hat off now, please?

125
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,414
Don't be frightened.

126
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,872
I simply want to look at you.

127
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:22,456
Take your hat off.
Don't be frightened.

128
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:34,997
Thank you.

129
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:36,622
Good afternoon.

130
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:39,622
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers.

131
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,456
Pull the curtains aside.

132
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,122
He is English...

133
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:00,372
he is 21 years of age...

134
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:02,914
and his name is John Merrick.

135
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:07,497
Gentlemen, in the course of
my profession I have come upon...

136
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:11,789
many lamentable deformities of
the face due to injury or disease...

137
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,372
as well as mutilations...

138
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:16,831
and contortions of the body
depending upon like causes.

139
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:19,122
But at no time have I met
with such...

140
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:22,039
a perverted or degraded version
of a human being as this man.

141
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:26,247
I draw your attention to the
insidious conditions affecting him.

142
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:28,664
- Can you see over there?
- Yes.

143
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:31,956
Note, if you will, the
extreme enlargement of the skull...

144
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:35,581
right upper limb,
which is totally useless...

145
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:38,122
the alarming curvature
of the spine.

146
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:41,414
- Would you turn around, please?
- Turn around, please.

147
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:46,456
The looseness of the skin...

148
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:52,039
and the varying fibrous tumors
that cover 90% of the body.

149
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,581
And there is every indication that
these afflictions have been...

150
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:59,122
in existence and have
progressed rapidly since birth.

151
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:01,831
The patient also suffers
from chronic bronchitis.

152
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:03,914
As an interesting side note...

153
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:05,997
in spite of the
aforementioned anomalies...

154
00:23:06,122 --> 00:23:11,206
the patient's genitals remain
entirely intact and unaffected.

155
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,914
Thank you.

156
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:19,039
And his left arm is perfectly
normal, as you see.

157
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:24,372
So then, gentlemen, owing
to this series of conditions...

158
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:27,664
the congenital skull exostosis,
extensive papillomatous growth...

159
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:30,164
large pendulous masses
in connection with the skin...

160
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:32,456
the great enlargement
of the right upper limb...

161
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:35,622
involving all the bones, the massive
distortion of the head...

162
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:40,122
and the extensive area
covered by papillomatous growth...

163
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:43,581
the patient has been called
the Elephant Man.

164
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:45,081
Thank you.

165
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:15,747
You never mentioned
his mental state.

166
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,456
Oh, he's an imbecile,
probably from birth.

167
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:21,456
The man's a complete idiot.

168
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,581
I pray to God he's an idiot.

169
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:37,539
Where have you been?

170
00:25:07,997 --> 00:25:09,414
Out.

171
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:13,831
How can I eat
with a noise like that?

172
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,372
Bytes, don't!

173
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:30,664
Where have you been?
What did you do?

174
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:38,664
- Our man is sick. Come right away.
- What is it?

175
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,956
Like this.

176
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:46,039
What did you do with him?
He's been like this all night.

177
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:51,789
He was fine when he left here.
Now look at him.

178
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,581
Yes, I intend to.

179
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:57,289
- What happened?
- He fell!

180
00:25:58,081 --> 00:25:59,872
He falls.

181
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,664
Looks like he's had
a very severe fall.

182
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:14,914
He's a clumsy soul.

183
00:26:15,997 --> 00:26:17,914
Never looks where he's going.

184
00:26:17,997 --> 00:26:22,247
But that's all right.
He has me to take care of him.

185
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,081
Why is he sitting up like this?
He needs rest.

186
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,372
Well, that's how he sleeps.

187
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:32,331
If he lies down,
he'll kill himself.

188
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:35,789
His head's too big.

189
00:26:35,914 --> 00:26:39,706
All right. This man
belongs in a hospital.

190
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:42,622
Can't you treat him here?

191
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:45,247
Listen, he's my livelihood.

192
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:48,581
We're business partners,
he and I.

193
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:53,789
He's the greatest freak
in the world.

194
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:58,039
Yes, now you listen. You won't have
much of a livelihood if he dies.

195
00:26:58,122 --> 00:27:01,039
Now, stop wasting my time.
I'm going to fetch a cab.

196
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:03,956
I truly, truly appreciate this,
my friend.

197
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:07,664
Listen. There are a lot of things
I could do for you.

198
00:27:08,747 --> 00:27:13,622
You see, I move in the proper
circles for this type of thing.

199
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:18,039
In fact, anything at all...

200
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:20,206
if you take my meaning.

201
00:27:21,664 --> 00:27:23,581
Everything will be taken care of.

202
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:25,581
It's good to do business with you.

203
00:27:48,622 --> 00:27:50,581
Here we go.

204
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:16,789
All right.

205
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,164
Can I have a bowl
of oatmeal, please?

206
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:14,997
Yes, sir.

207
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:17,914
Breakfasting with the patients
this morning, Mr. Treves?

208
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:20,039
Yes. No, it's for a patient.

209
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:22,164
There you are, sir.

210
00:29:23,414 --> 00:29:24,997
Thank you. Morning.

211
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:26,414
Morning.

212
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,456
Oh, Treves! Just come here
for a moment, will you?

213
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:45,122
What's that?

214
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:50,289
Good heavens! You haven't acquired
a sudden taste for this, have you?

215
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,331
- Yes, sir. It's quite nutritious.
- Possibly.

216
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:55,664
Not quite the diet
for a grown man.

217
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,206
Nurse!

218
00:29:58,206 --> 00:30:00,081
When you have a moment...

219
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:04,914
take this up to the patient
in the isolation ward, will you?

220
00:30:04,997 --> 00:30:06,706
Yes, sir.

221
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:11,122
Don't be frightened.
He won't hurt you.

222
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:14,622
Won't he indeed!
Just a minute, Treves.

223
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,997
Something I want to say to you.
Come in.

224
00:30:19,914 --> 00:30:23,456
A hospital's no place for secrecy,
you know, Mr. Treves.

225
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:27,706
Doctors spiriting hooded figures
about is apt to cause comment.

226
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:29,997
Why wasn't this patient
properly admitted?

227
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:33,664
Why is he in the isolation ward?
He's not contagious, is he?

228
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:37,914
No, sir. He's got chronic bronchitis
and he's been badly beaten.

229
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,997
Why isn't he
in the general ward then?

230
00:30:40,914 --> 00:30:43,747
Well, sir, he's quite
seriously deformed...

231
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:47,081
and I fear the other patients
would find him rather shocking.

232
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:49,914
Deformed? Is that it?

233
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:53,081
Am I to assume then
that he is ultimately incurable?

234
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:54,081
Yes, sir.

235
00:30:54,206 --> 00:30:57,289
But you must be aware that this
hospital doesn't accept incurables.

236
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,289
The rules are perfectly clear.

237
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,289
Yes, sir,
I'm well aware of that...

238
00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:04,206
but this case
is quite exceptional.

239
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:28,622
I quite appreciate your problem,
Mr. Treves.

240
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:33,081
Why not contact the British Home or
the Royal Hospital for Incurables?

241
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:35,081
They might find a place for him.

242
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:37,747
I'll look into it.
Would you like to meet him?

243
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,039
Excuse me.

244
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:59,247
The Elephant Man.

245
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:07,372
Sorry.

246
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:17,081
I should have warned you.

247
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:19,081
Please forgive me.

248
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:22,289
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

249
00:32:23,747 --> 00:32:26,664
Please ask Mrs. Mothershead
to come up here.

250
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:30,164
Tell her to knock on the door
and wait for me.

251
00:32:41,414 --> 00:32:44,372
I'm sorry about that. I...

252
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:49,664
We'll bring you another breakfast.
You must be very hungry.

253
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:54,122
And I think you'll be quite
comfortable here for a while.

254
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:56,247
I'll see to it that you have
everything you need.

255
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:19,456
Cor blimey!

256
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:28,581
So, this is the Elephant Man.

257
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:32,622
I ain't seen nothing
like you before.

258
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:37,539
What the bleedin' hell
happened to ya?

259
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:43,747
Dumb, eh?

260
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:48,247
I like people
that can keep quiet.

261
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:54,414
Here, have a drink.

262
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,414
Go on! No?

263
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:06,581
You should be more sociable, mate.

264
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:10,997
You'll get yourself disliked.

265
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:19,581
You and I are
gonna be good friends...

266
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:21,914
and I've got a lot of friends
who'd like to meet you.

267
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,081
And they will, mate.

268
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:27,081
Believe me, they will.

269
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:41,539
I've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?

270
00:37:41,622 --> 00:37:43,747
Come on, up on the bed.

271
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:23,081
All he understands
is a good smack.

272
00:38:23,206 --> 00:38:26,789
He's had his share of smacks. That's
what drives him under the bed.

273
00:38:26,914 --> 00:38:29,581
You have to treat him
with kindness and patience.

274
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:33,331
Perhaps you've got time for that
sort of treatment, Mr. Treves.

275
00:38:33,414 --> 00:38:36,372
But I haven't.
I've got a hospital to run.

276
00:38:36,456 --> 00:38:38,622
Now, don't you waste your time
with him, sir.

277
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:43,497
It's like talking to a brick wall.

278
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:47,914
Now, I don't mean to be harsh but...

279
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,997
he doesn't belong here.

280
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:56,997
Honestly, sir, honestly,
what can you do for him?

281
00:39:09,372 --> 00:39:13,039
Oh, and by the way,
Mr. Carr Gomm said...

282
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:16,081
he would like to see you
when you can spare a moment.

283
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:17,831
- Yes.
- Right.

284
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:26,164
I can't help you
unless you help me.

285
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,831
You see, I believe there's something
that you want to say to me.

286
00:39:38,914 --> 00:39:41,581
Something back there.

287
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:44,206
I can't help you unless
you help me, you know!

288
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:50,414
I believe you want to say something
to me, don't you?

289
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:55,414
I've got to understand what you're
feeling, what you're thinking.

290
00:39:57,122 --> 00:39:59,206
Do you understand me?

291
00:40:02,372 --> 00:40:06,039
All right, just nod your head
if you can... Can you understand me?

292
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:08,872
Just nod your head
if you understand me.

293
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,164
All right.

294
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,331
You do understand.

295
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,914
I want to hear...
I want to hear you talk.

296
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,831
We're gonna show them that
you're not a wall. Understand?

297
00:40:24,914 --> 00:40:27,664
I want you to talk to me.

298
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:31,706
All right, now,
I want to hear you say it.

299
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:34,289
I've got to hear how
you say things.

300
00:40:34,414 --> 00:40:38,789
I won't hurt you. I've got to hear
and understand how you say things.

301
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:42,289
Very slowly,
I want you to say, "Yes."

302
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:45,664
Say, "Yes."

303
00:40:50,997 --> 00:40:52,872
Yes.

304
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:55,414
Yes!

305
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:56,956
Good.

306
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:01,081
All right, now, just once more
say it again. "Yes."

307
00:41:05,914 --> 00:41:08,539
Yes, I can understand that.

308
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:10,081
That's good.

309
00:41:11,247 --> 00:41:13,247
That's very good.
All right now.

310
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:16,289
I'm going to say some words to you,
and I want you to repeat them.

311
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:18,581
Do you understand?

312
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:21,081
Say, "Hello.

313
00:41:21,164 --> 00:41:22,914
My name is..."

314
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:28,956
Hello.

315
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:32,956
My name is...

316
00:41:33,081 --> 00:41:35,706
"John Merrick."

317
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:41,622
No. John... That's very good.

318
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:43,914
Say, "John Merrick."

319
00:41:48,414 --> 00:41:52,539
"Hello. My name is John Merrick."

320
00:41:54,706 --> 00:41:55,956
Hello.

321
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:59,414
My name is...

322
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:02,081
John Merrick.

323
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:03,539
You can speak.

324
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:14,206
How did you get up here?

325
00:42:15,706 --> 00:42:17,622
I want my man back.

326
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:22,331
- Just a moment. How did you get up?
- Never mind that. I want my man.

327
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,331
He's still very sick.

328
00:42:24,414 --> 00:42:26,789
Please, come downstairs with me,
and I'll explain the situation.

329
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:28,539
Don't!

330
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,997
Don't.

331
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:36,081
You've had plenty of time to...

332
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:38,331
cure him.

333
00:42:38,414 --> 00:42:41,081
And now he's leaving with me.

334
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:46,414
Do you understand me now,
Mr. Treves?

335
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,206
We made a deal.

336
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:50,081
You misunderstood.

337
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:54,747
This man has suffered a severe fall,
if you take my meaning.

338
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,622
He's my patient now.

339
00:42:56,747 --> 00:42:58,747
Pull the other one,
why don't you?

340
00:42:58,831 --> 00:43:00,747
Mr. Bytes, I'm sorry.

341
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:03,289
But all you do is profit
from another man's misery.

342
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:07,372
Do you think
you're better than me?

343
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:09,372
No, I never said that.

344
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:13,039
You wanted the freak...

345
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:16,581
to show to those doctor chums of
yours, to make a name for yourself.

346
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:18,622
You, my friend.

347
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:25,247
I gave you the freak on trust...

348
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:28,414
in the name of science...

349
00:43:28,497 --> 00:43:30,456
and now I want him back!

350
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:32,581
You do not own this man!
Now stop it!

351
00:43:33,497 --> 00:43:35,247
I want him back!

352
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:37,414
So you can beat him?
So you can starve him?

353
00:43:37,497 --> 00:43:39,831
A dog in the streets
would fare better with you!

354
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:41,956
I shall go to the authorities.

355
00:43:42,081 --> 00:43:45,456
Go to the authorities then!
Go to them by all means.

356
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,914
They'll be very interested
to hear your story as well as ours.

357
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:52,706
Now...

358
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:57,247
I think we really do understand
one another.

359
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:01,747
All right.

360
00:44:16,706 --> 00:44:19,914
Singularly unattractive character,
I must say.

361
00:44:21,747 --> 00:44:25,789
Well, Treves, it seems to me I might
as well meet this patient of yours.

362
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:29,289
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

363
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:34,247
Shall we say in a few days then?

364
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,622
Shall we say 2:00
tomorrow afternoon?

365
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:43,497
Yes. Well, whatever's
most convenient for you, sir.

366
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:45,956
2:00 then, tomorrow.

367
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:48,081
Thank you very much.

368
00:44:52,414 --> 00:44:53,831
2:00!

369
00:44:57,706 --> 00:45:00,081
Morning, Mr. Treves.
Early again, I see.

370
00:45:00,206 --> 00:45:01,456
Yes.

371
00:45:01,581 --> 00:45:04,539
With these early habits of yours,
you'd have made a good milkman.

372
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:08,331
- I'll keep that in mind, Charles.
- Okay, sir. Good morning.

373
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:19,414
He restoreth my soul.

374
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:24,539
He leadeth me into paths of...
for His name's sake.

375
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:27,997
Righteousness. Righteousness.

376
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:34,247
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness...

377
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,831
for His name's sake.

378
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:39,956
Good. That's very good. Good.

379
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:44,372
When your visitor comes today, say
it exactly the way you've said it.

380
00:45:44,456 --> 00:45:49,164
So when I introduce him to you,
say the words that you've learned.

381
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:52,997
If you have trouble with any words,
I'll help you, so don't worry.

382
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:55,581
I will introduce him to you
and say...

383
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:58,039
"Please meet Mr. Carr Gomm."

384
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,706
And you will say?

385
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:05,497
Hello. My name is John Merrick.

386
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:07,831
I'm very pleased to meet you.

387
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:11,581
Good! Good.

388
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:14,622
I'll go and get Mr. Carr Gomm.

389
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,872
It is only a physical problem.

390
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:27,247
He has trouble with certain sounds
because of...

391
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:30,664
the constrictive deformity
of the mouth, but he can talk.

392
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:34,581
Talking's one thing, but is he able
to understand what's said to him?

393
00:46:34,664 --> 00:46:37,622
Yes. Oh, yes! Except...

394
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:41,706
Except he's so anxious to make
a good impression on you...

395
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:43,997
that he might seem a little nervous.

396
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:03,289
Come in.

397
00:47:17,456 --> 00:47:18,664
John...

398
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:21,831
may I introduce you
to Mr. Carr Gomm?

399
00:47:21,914 --> 00:47:24,956
Mr. Carr Gomm,
this is John Merrick.

400
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:29,581
Hello. My name is John Merrick.

401
00:47:29,664 --> 00:47:31,622
I'm very pleased to meet you.

402
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:33,831
I'm very pleased to meet you.

403
00:47:36,456 --> 00:47:38,372
How are you feeling today?

404
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:41,122
I feel much better.

405
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:44,706
Are you comfortable here?

406
00:47:47,372 --> 00:47:50,456
Everybody's been very kind.

407
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:53,372
How is your bronchitis?

408
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:08,081
Mr. Merrick likes the food here,
don't you?

409
00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:16,206
Much better than what
I'm used to.

410
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:17,997
Oh, yes?

411
00:48:18,914 --> 00:48:20,997
Yes. And what was that?

412
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:25,372
Potatoes.

413
00:48:27,122 --> 00:48:29,164
I understood
that you'd been flogged.

414
00:48:32,206 --> 00:48:35,914
I feel much better now.

415
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,372
That's splendid.

416
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,414
How do you find Mr. Treves?

417
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:42,706
As a teacher, I mean.

418
00:48:48,247 --> 00:48:52,831
Everybody's been very kind.

419
00:48:55,456 --> 00:48:59,789
How long did you and Mr. Treves
prepare for this interview?

420
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:10,581
Everybody's been very kind.

421
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:12,581
Yes, of course, I understand.

422
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:15,622
Well, it's been a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Merrick.

423
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,872
Good day to you.

424
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:29,456
Very good, John.

425
00:49:29,581 --> 00:49:31,456
It was very good.

426
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:33,456
I'll be back in a moment.

427
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:40,414
The Lord is my shepherd...

428
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:43,789
I shall not want.

429
00:49:44,872 --> 00:49:46,747
He maketh me lie down...

430
00:49:46,872 --> 00:49:51,372
It was a brave attempt, but the man
was mouthing words taught by you.

431
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:55,081
Yes. Well, I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

432
00:49:55,164 --> 00:49:58,331
He restoreth my soul.

433
00:49:58,414 --> 00:50:00,164
He simply doesn't belong here.

434
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,539
He'd be better off somewhere where
he can be constantly looked after.

435
00:50:03,622 --> 00:50:06,581
I'm sorry things have turned out
this way. Good day to you.

436
00:50:06,664 --> 00:50:08,081
Yea...

437
00:50:09,414 --> 00:50:12,914
though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

438
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:14,831
I fear no evil...

439
00:50:14,914 --> 00:50:17,747
for Thou art with me.

440
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:20,247
Thy rod and staff, they...

441
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:21,831
Mr. Carr Gomm!

442
00:50:24,331 --> 00:50:26,622
Yes, what is it?

443
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:28,456
It's that.

444
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:33,039
I didn't teach him that part.

445
00:50:34,747 --> 00:50:37,747
Surely goodness and mercy...

446
00:50:37,872 --> 00:50:41,081
will follow me all the days
of my life...

447
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:46,206
and I'll dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

448
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:53,706
How did you know the rest of it?
I didn't teach you the rest of it.

449
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:55,747
It's very strange.

450
00:50:56,997 --> 00:50:59,414
Tell me, how did you know
the rest of it?

451
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:01,831
The 23rd Psalm.

452
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:09,706
I used to read the Bible every day.

453
00:51:11,456 --> 00:51:14,081
I know it very well...

454
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:16,456
and the Book of Common Prayer.

455
00:51:17,997 --> 00:51:21,914
The 23rd Psalm is very beautiful.
It's my favorite.

456
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:27,872
Treves, come and see me in my office
when you're through up here.

457
00:51:27,956 --> 00:51:29,914
There's something important
I want to say to you.

458
00:51:31,247 --> 00:51:34,956
Good-bye, Mr. Merrick.
I do hope we shall meet again.

459
00:51:42,997 --> 00:51:46,622
Well, why didn't you tell me
you could read?

460
00:51:48,914 --> 00:51:51,747
I was frightened.

461
00:51:52,872 --> 00:51:54,039
I see.

462
00:51:54,122 --> 00:51:59,122
I was afraid to talk.

463
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:04,914
Please forgive me.

464
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:18,206
Can you imagine the kind of life
he must have had?

465
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:20,164
Yes, I think I can.

466
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:22,164
I don't believe so.

467
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:26,247
No one could possibly imagine it.
I don't believe any of us can!

468
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:38,956
"Terrible though
his appearance is...

469
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:43,122
so terrible indeed that women
and nervous persons...

470
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:46,581
fly in horror
from the sight of him...

471
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:52,081
and that he is debarred from seeking
to earn his livelihood in any way...

472
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:54,956
yet he is superior in intelligence.

473
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:59,039
He can read and write,
he's quiet, gentle...

474
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:02,956
not to say even refined
in his mind."

475
00:53:10,497 --> 00:53:13,747
I should very much like
to meet this gentleman.

476
00:53:40,414 --> 00:53:42,456
Have you seen this?

477
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:50,914
Listen to this.

478
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:53,039
Hey up! Hey up!

479
00:53:57,956 --> 00:53:59,581
Now listen.

480
00:53:59,706 --> 00:54:03,289
This is a letter
to the London Times...

481
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:05,539
from the governor of the hospital.

482
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:09,497
"There is now in a little room
off one of our attic wards...

483
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:12,081
a man named John Merrick.

484
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:14,289
So dreadful a sight
that he is unable...

485
00:54:14,414 --> 00:54:17,497
even to come out by daylight
to the garden.

486
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:20,581
He is being called
the Elephant Man...

487
00:54:20,664 --> 00:54:23,164
on account of
his terrible deformity.

488
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:28,164
His appearance is so terrible
that women and nervous persons...

489
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:30,872
fly in terror
at the sight of him."

490
00:54:33,914 --> 00:54:36,414
And how do you get tickets
to see him?

491
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,747
Your very own Sunny Jim.

492
00:54:38,831 --> 00:54:41,414
- Let's go and see him then!
- All right, keep your shirt on.

493
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:43,831
The time must be right.

494
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:47,372
Right now he's in the attic.

495
00:54:47,456 --> 00:54:52,831
But tomorrow they're moving him to
Bedstead Square right into my lap.

496
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:56,372
Then, for the right price...

497
00:54:56,456 --> 00:55:01,539
you will see something you'll
never ever see again in your life!

498
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:52,914
Well, don't look so glum, girls.

499
00:55:52,997 --> 00:55:56,831
Enthusiastic volunteers
should be more cheerful, hmm?

500
00:55:57,747 --> 00:56:00,414
Put your collar straight, girl.

501
00:56:00,497 --> 00:56:02,914
And remember...

502
00:56:02,997 --> 00:56:05,956
that under no circumstances...

503
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:07,497
whatsoever...

504
00:56:09,664 --> 00:56:12,122
are any mirrors to be brought
into this room.

505
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,206
Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.

506
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:17,247
Yes.

507
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:18,747
All right.

508
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:28,872
- He's so ugly.
- Ugly or not, you're gonna help me.

509
00:56:34,872 --> 00:56:37,664
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

510
00:56:37,747 --> 00:56:39,206
Yes.

511
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:43,081
You look very nice
in your new clothes.

512
00:56:44,747 --> 00:56:46,831
Thank you very much.

513
00:56:46,914 --> 00:56:49,581
If there's nothing else,
I suppose we'll be leaving you now.

514
00:56:49,664 --> 00:56:51,581
No, there's nothing.

515
00:57:22,456 --> 00:57:24,414
You ready for tea?

516
00:57:26,206 --> 00:57:28,206
Please go in, John.

517
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:37,206
Make yourself comfortable.

518
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:51,706
Come along, meet our guest.

519
00:58:01,122 --> 00:58:03,872
Mr. Merrick, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Anne.

520
00:58:03,956 --> 00:58:06,956
Anne, this is John Merrick.

521
00:58:10,914 --> 00:58:13,039
I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mr. Merrick.

522
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:19,414
I'm...

523
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:22,706
I'm very pleased...

524
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:31,289
What is it?
What's the matter?

525
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:35,872
It's just that I...

526
00:58:36,997 --> 00:58:40,997
I'm not used to being...

527
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:45,539
treated so well by...

528
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,706
a beautiful woman.

529
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:53,081
Would you like a cup of tea,
Mr. Merrick?

530
00:58:54,122 --> 00:58:56,081
That's a good idea.

531
00:58:57,706 --> 00:59:02,081
Would you like to come and see the
rest of the house? I'll show you.

532
00:59:13,622 --> 00:59:15,581
How's your tea?

533
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,914
It's very good!

534
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:28,456
I'm enjoying my visit here
very much.

535
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:33,039
It's so kind of you to invite me
into your own home.

536
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:39,664
I'm sorry that I...

537
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:42,414
made a spectacle of myself.

538
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:44,664
No, not at all.

539
00:59:49,497 --> 00:59:52,747
I like the way...

540
00:59:52,872 --> 00:59:55,372
you arranged your pictures
on the mantelpiece.

541
00:59:55,456 --> 00:59:56,914
Oh, thank you.

542
00:59:56,997 --> 01:00:00,664
Is that the way they do it
in most houses?

543
01:00:00,747 --> 01:00:03,747
Yes, I'm sure they do, yes.

544
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:05,747
Who are they of?

545
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:11,081
These are relatives,
and these are our children.

546
01:00:11,164 --> 01:00:13,622
Children?
Oh, may I see?

547
01:00:13,747 --> 01:00:15,331
Yes, of course.

548
01:00:22,997 --> 01:00:25,414
Where are the children?

549
01:00:26,622 --> 01:00:29,664
Well, um, well,
they're out with friends...

550
01:00:29,747 --> 01:00:31,372
at the moment.

551
01:00:31,456 --> 01:00:34,081
Friends.

552
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:37,414
And here is Frederick's mother.

553
01:00:39,956 --> 01:00:42,164
Oh, how lovely.

554
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:46,206
And these are my parents.

555
01:00:52,122 --> 01:00:54,706
They have such...

556
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:57,747
noble faces.

557
01:00:57,872 --> 01:01:00,997
Yes, I've always...
I've always thought so myself.

558
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:04,081
Would you...

559
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:08,997
Would you care to see my mother?

560
01:01:10,372 --> 01:01:11,789
Your mother?

561
01:01:13,456 --> 01:01:15,206
Yes, please.

562
01:01:23,456 --> 01:01:25,039
Oh, she's...

563
01:01:26,747 --> 01:01:28,747
Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful.

564
01:01:28,872 --> 01:01:31,122
Oh, she had...

565
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:33,997
She had the face of an angel.

566
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:45,164
I must've...

567
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:52,539
been a great disappointment to her.

568
01:01:52,622 --> 01:01:54,206
No, Mr. Merrick.

569
01:01:55,872 --> 01:01:58,581
No son as loving as you
could ever be a disappointment.

570
01:02:00,914 --> 01:02:04,456
If only I could find her...

571
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:06,956
so she could see me...

572
01:02:07,081 --> 01:02:11,372
with such lovely friends here now.

573
01:02:11,456 --> 01:02:13,456
Perhaps she could...

574
01:02:13,581 --> 01:02:15,456
love me as I am.

575
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:20,164
I've tried so hard to be good.

576
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:29,706
I'm so sorry.

577
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,747
Please.

578
01:02:32,831 --> 01:02:34,831
I'm so sorry.

579
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:38,122
Please. Here.

580
01:03:16,872 --> 01:03:18,789
What's that you're doing?

581
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:23,622
What is it?

582
01:03:26,747 --> 01:03:29,789
I see.
It's St. Phillips.

583
01:03:29,914 --> 01:03:32,081
Why, that's very good.

584
01:03:32,206 --> 01:03:34,914
I mean, you got the windows
and arches just right.

585
01:03:49,914 --> 01:03:51,497
I wish...

586
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,581
I could sleep...

587
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:58,914
like normal people.

588
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:10,039
- Mr. Treves?
- Yes?

589
01:04:10,122 --> 01:04:12,622
There's something that...

590
01:04:12,706 --> 01:04:14,789
I've been meaning to ask you...

591
01:04:14,914 --> 01:04:16,956
for some time now.

592
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:18,414
What's that?

593
01:04:20,081 --> 01:04:21,539
Can you cure me?

594
01:04:25,872 --> 01:04:28,206
No, we can care for you...

595
01:04:28,289 --> 01:04:31,331
but we can't cure you.

596
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,497
I thought not.

597
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:50,247
Come in.

598
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:55,956
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

599
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:59,164
There's someone here who'd like
to meet you, if that's all right.

600
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:01,789
May I introduce you
to one of the bright lights...

601
01:05:01,914 --> 01:05:04,081
of the English stage,
Mrs. Kendal.

602
01:05:04,206 --> 01:05:07,956
- Mrs. Kendal, Mr. John Merrick.
- Good day, Mr. Merrick.

603
01:05:10,164 --> 01:05:11,747
Good day.

604
01:05:11,831 --> 01:05:14,414
I've brought you some things.
I hope you like them.

605
01:05:14,497 --> 01:05:16,414
I hope you don't
think it too forward.

606
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:23,831
I knew you'd understand.

607
01:05:23,956 --> 01:05:25,872
I'll leave you together.

608
01:05:27,831 --> 01:05:29,414
Here.

609
01:05:31,789 --> 01:05:36,039
I want you to know, I don't go about
giving my picture to just anyone.

610
01:05:36,122 --> 01:05:38,081
Oh, no.
I wouldn't think of it.

611
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:42,206
It's beautiful.

612
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:44,622
You're so...

613
01:05:44,747 --> 01:05:47,414
I'll... Well, I'll...

614
01:05:49,706 --> 01:05:53,539
I shall put it in a...
in a place of honor.

615
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:58,414
Here, next to my mother.

616
01:06:04,372 --> 01:06:06,497
She's very pretty, your mother.

617
01:06:06,622 --> 01:06:08,164
Oh, yes.

618
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,456
I see you're constructing a...

619
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:27,164
church?

620
01:06:28,622 --> 01:06:32,289
Oh, no.
It's a cathedral.

621
01:06:32,414 --> 01:06:34,706
You see?

622
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:38,622
Only, I have to rely...

623
01:06:38,747 --> 01:06:40,289
on my imagination...

624
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:43,122
for what I can't actually see.

625
01:06:54,664 --> 01:06:59,872
Mr. Treves tells me
that you're in the theater.

626
01:06:59,956 --> 01:07:02,039
Do you live there?

627
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:04,914
Oh, no, Mr. Merrick.
I just work there.

628
01:07:06,247 --> 01:07:08,622
Well, it must be...

629
01:07:08,747 --> 01:07:11,581
wonderful just to work there.

630
01:07:11,664 --> 01:07:14,831
- Is it beautiful?
- You've never been?

631
01:07:14,956 --> 01:07:17,539
I'm afraid not.

632
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:20,206
Oh, Mr. Merrick.
You must go.

633
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:22,497
The theater's the most
beautiful place on earth.

634
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,581
Of course, I am a bit partial.

635
01:07:25,872 --> 01:07:29,956
The theater is romance.

636
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:32,914
Romance.

637
01:07:37,956 --> 01:07:40,414
Which reminds me,
I've brought you something else.

638
01:07:47,372 --> 01:07:49,289
- Thank you.
- Have you read it?

639
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:55,289
No, but I certainly shall.

640
01:08:03,331 --> 01:08:06,247
Romeo and Juliet.

641
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:08,664
Yes, I've heard of this.

642
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:17,206
"If I profane
with my unworthiest hand...

643
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:19,706
this holy shrine...

644
01:08:19,789 --> 01:08:23,164
the gentle fine is this...

645
01:08:23,247 --> 01:08:25,914
My lips...

646
01:08:25,997 --> 01:08:28,581
two blushing pilgrims...

647
01:08:28,664 --> 01:08:32,539
ready stand to smooth
that rough touch...

648
01:08:35,831 --> 01:08:37,747
with a tender kiss."

649
01:08:38,956 --> 01:08:42,872
"Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...

650
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:45,247
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

651
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:49,497
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...

652
01:08:49,622 --> 01:08:51,914
and palm to palm
is holy Palmer's kiss."

653
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:56,956
"O, then dear saint...

654
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:59,997
let lips do what hands do.

655
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:02,831
They pray, grant thou...

656
01:09:02,956 --> 01:09:07,081
lest faith turn to despair."

657
01:09:07,206 --> 01:09:09,122
"Saints do not move...

658
01:09:10,622 --> 01:09:12,581
though grant for prayer's sake."

659
01:09:13,789 --> 01:09:16,581
"Then move not...

660
01:09:16,664 --> 01:09:20,289
while my prayer's effect I take.

661
01:09:21,622 --> 01:09:23,497
Thus from my lips...

662
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:27,247
by thine, my sin is purged."

663
01:09:31,831 --> 01:09:34,414
Oh, yes.
And then it says they kiss.

664
01:09:37,789 --> 01:09:40,747
"Then have my lips
the sin that they have took."

665
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:50,081
"Sin from thy lips?

666
01:09:50,164 --> 01:09:52,914
O trespass sweetly urged.

667
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:57,247
Give me my sin again."

668
01:10:03,331 --> 01:10:05,331
Oh, Mr. Merrick.

669
01:10:05,414 --> 01:10:07,539
You're not an elephant man at all.

670
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:16,247
You're Romeo.

671
01:10:23,997 --> 01:10:27,456
"Mrs. Kendal, always at the
forefront of fashion and form...

672
01:10:27,581 --> 01:10:30,206
was seen leaving the London
the other afternoon.

673
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:32,914
No, dear readers, the most
facile actress of our day...

674
01:10:32,997 --> 01:10:37,247
has not been taken ill, but rather
said she was visiting a friend.

675
01:10:37,331 --> 01:10:40,497
And who was the lucky recipient
of this attention?

676
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:43,706
Quick inquiries proved it to be
none other than Mr. John Merrick...

677
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:48,456
the Elephant Man, with whom our
readers are undoubtedly familiar.

678
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:50,872
After a chat of
three quarters of an hour...

679
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:53,164
Mrs. Kendal was kind enough
to leave Mr. Merrick...

680
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:55,372
with an autographed portrait
of herself."

681
01:10:55,456 --> 01:10:57,372
I saw it in his room.

682
01:10:57,456 --> 01:11:01,081
"Owing to a disfigurement
of the most extreme nature...

683
01:11:01,164 --> 01:11:05,289
Mr. Merrick has never been properly
presented to London society.

684
01:11:05,414 --> 01:11:07,497
But knowing that
wherever Mrs. Kendal goes...

685
01:11:07,581 --> 01:11:11,789
others inevitably follow,
the question arises...

686
01:11:11,914 --> 01:11:14,914
'Will London society
present itself to him?"'

687
01:11:14,997 --> 01:11:19,539
This walking stick is so...
is so dashing.

688
01:11:19,622 --> 01:11:23,039
Much more elegant than my old one.

689
01:11:25,206 --> 01:11:26,789
More tea?

690
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:37,581
You see, I don't go out
as often as I would like...

691
01:11:37,706 --> 01:11:39,914
because naturally...

692
01:11:39,997 --> 01:11:43,122
some people do find
my appearance disturbing.

693
01:11:43,247 --> 01:11:46,789
If you have a chill,
I could close the window.

694
01:11:46,872 --> 01:11:49,664
No, I'm fine.
Please...

695
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:52,414
I mean, thank you.

696
01:11:52,497 --> 01:11:54,081
Thank you.

697
01:11:55,414 --> 01:11:57,039
You see...

698
01:11:58,331 --> 01:12:00,664
people are frightened...

699
01:12:00,789 --> 01:12:02,956
by what they don't understand.

700
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:08,122
And it is hard to understand
even for me...

701
01:12:08,247 --> 01:12:10,706
because, well, my mother...

702
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:14,664
she was so very beautiful.

703
01:12:24,997 --> 01:12:27,914
Mrs. Mothershead, I don't think he
should have any more visitors today.

704
01:12:27,997 --> 01:12:30,206
I have to lecture at the college,
so I'll be back this evening.

705
01:12:30,289 --> 01:12:31,414
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.

706
01:12:31,497 --> 01:12:33,539
Excuse me, but if you have the time,
I would like a word with you.

707
01:12:33,622 --> 01:12:36,747
- I'm awfully late. What is it?
- Well, sir, I don't quite...

708
01:12:36,872 --> 01:12:38,914
I don't quite understand...

709
01:12:38,997 --> 01:12:42,372
why it is you allow
that sort of people in there.

710
01:12:42,456 --> 01:12:45,247
Why? Because he enjoys it,
and I think it's very good for him.

711
01:12:45,331 --> 01:12:47,914
Yes, but sir, you saw
the expression on their faces.

712
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:50,122
They didn't hide their disgust.

713
01:12:50,247 --> 01:12:51,956
They don't care
anything about John.

714
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:54,289
They only want
to impress their friends.

715
01:12:54,414 --> 01:12:56,289
I think you're being
rather harsh on them, don't you?

716
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,414
I beg your pardon, sir.

717
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:00,456
You yourself hardly showed him
much loving kindness...

718
01:13:00,581 --> 01:13:02,497
when he first arrived, did you?

719
01:13:02,581 --> 01:13:06,414
I bathed him, I fed him and
I cleaned up after him, didn't I?

720
01:13:06,497 --> 01:13:09,039
And I see that
my nurses do the same.

721
01:13:09,122 --> 01:13:13,539
And if"loving kindness"
can be called care...

722
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:16,414
and practical concern...

723
01:13:16,539 --> 01:13:19,789
then I did show him loving kindness
and I am not ashamed to admit it.

724
01:13:19,914 --> 01:13:23,081
I didn't mean it exactly that way.
Now, please believe me.

725
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:25,081
Now, of course
I appreciate your concern.

726
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:27,497
I appreciate everything that
you've done for Mr. Merrick.

727
01:13:27,581 --> 01:13:32,039
But I am the physician in charge
and I must do what is best for him.

728
01:13:32,122 --> 01:13:35,789
- Please, now, I'm also very late.
- If you ask my opinion...

729
01:13:35,914 --> 01:13:38,289
he's only being stared at
all over again.

730
01:13:39,497 --> 01:13:41,081
Thank you.

731
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:09,456
Night time.

732
01:16:59,956 --> 01:17:01,914
What's the matter, Freddie?

733
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:07,914
I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes.

734
01:17:07,997 --> 01:17:09,664
What on earth
made you think of him?

735
01:17:09,747 --> 01:17:14,747
Well, I'm beginning to believe that
Mr. Bytes and I are very much alike.

736
01:17:14,872 --> 01:17:16,456
That's absurd.

737
01:17:19,247 --> 01:17:22,372
It seems that
I've made Mr. Merrick...

738
01:17:22,456 --> 01:17:26,414
into a curiosity all over again,
doesn't it?

739
01:17:26,539 --> 01:17:29,747
Only this time in a hospital
rather than a carnival.

740
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:33,831
My name is constantly
in the papers...

741
01:17:33,914 --> 01:17:36,914
I'm always being praised
to the skies.

742
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:40,956
Patients are now expressly
asking for my services.

743
01:17:41,081 --> 01:17:43,539
Of course they do,
because you're a very fine doctor.

744
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:46,747
John Merrick is happier
and more fulfilled now...

745
01:17:46,872 --> 01:17:48,372
than he's ever been
in his entire life...

746
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:50,622
and it's completely due to you.

747
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:56,164
What was it all for?
Why did I do it?

748
01:17:56,247 --> 01:17:58,164
Freddie, what are you trying to say?

749
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:05,247
Am I a good man...

750
01:18:06,372 --> 01:18:08,289
or am I a bad man?

751
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:17,789
Steady on, Treves.
Steady on, my dear fellow.

752
01:18:17,914 --> 01:18:19,831
Come sit down, won't you?

753
01:18:25,456 --> 01:18:28,789
Gentlemen, I know we usually
open these proceedings...

754
01:18:28,914 --> 01:18:30,789
by reading the minutes.

755
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:33,414
But on this occasion,
in the interests of urgency...

756
01:18:33,497 --> 01:18:35,206
I think we should first conclude...

757
01:18:35,289 --> 01:18:37,706
the matter
previously under discussion...

758
01:18:37,789 --> 01:18:40,122
the case of Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man.

759
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:44,414
One moment, Mr. Chairman.
As far as I'm concerned...

760
01:18:44,539 --> 01:18:47,706
this creature has no business
being here at all.

761
01:18:48,914 --> 01:18:50,789
I, for one,
am sick and tired...

762
01:18:50,914 --> 01:18:53,831
of this competitive freak-hunting...

763
01:18:53,914 --> 01:18:56,581
by these overly ambitious
young doctors...

764
01:18:56,664 --> 01:18:58,872
trying to make names for themselves.

765
01:18:58,956 --> 01:19:02,706
To parade them about in front of the
pathological society is one thing...

766
01:19:02,789 --> 01:19:04,872
but to waste this committee's
valuable time...

767
01:19:04,956 --> 01:19:09,289
with requests for shelter for these
abominations of nature is another.

768
01:19:14,289 --> 01:19:17,164
You must be more careful.

769
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:21,247
In the light of these facts,
our course is clear.

770
01:19:21,372 --> 01:19:24,706
The question is not whether to
accept this creature as a patient.

771
01:19:24,789 --> 01:19:28,247
The question is, when will
those rooms be vacated for use...

772
01:19:28,372 --> 01:19:31,497
by better qualified,
more deserving cases?

773
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:33,247
I move that this Elephant Man...

774
01:19:33,372 --> 01:19:35,831
be removed from
the premises immediately.

775
01:19:35,914 --> 01:19:39,622
We have a sacred duty
to cure the sick...

776
01:19:39,747 --> 01:19:41,331
not care for circus animals.

777
01:19:42,747 --> 01:19:46,081
That is my last word on the subject.
Mr. Chairman, shall we vote?

778
01:19:46,206 --> 01:19:49,747
I take it, Mr. Broadneck, your mind
is quite unshakable in this matter?

779
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:52,914
Mr. Chairman,
do you not have ears?

780
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:55,539
I am unalterably opposed!

781
01:19:56,289 --> 01:19:58,289
My mind is made up on this!

782
01:20:00,164 --> 01:20:02,247
You shall not sway me.

783
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:06,164
May we now vote, Mr. Chairman,
at long last?

784
01:20:07,289 --> 01:20:08,747
Yes, Broadneck.

785
01:20:08,872 --> 01:20:10,789
I think the time has come.

786
01:20:11,872 --> 01:20:14,997
Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness...

787
01:20:15,081 --> 01:20:18,331
Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

788
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:38,956
Good morning, gentlemen.
I hope I am not disturbing you.

789
01:20:39,081 --> 01:20:41,081
On the contrary, ma'am.
Your presence here...

790
01:20:41,206 --> 01:20:43,872
is always greatly appreciated.

791
01:20:43,956 --> 01:20:46,997
We were just taking a vote
on Mr. Merrick.

792
01:20:51,081 --> 01:20:54,831
Her Royal Highness has shown
the greatest interest in his fate.

793
01:20:54,914 --> 01:20:57,289
Indeed I have, sir,
as has the queen.

794
01:21:00,747 --> 01:21:03,414
I have a brief communication
from Her Majesty...

795
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:06,039
which she has requested
that I read to you.

796
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,956
"To the Governing Committee,
London Hospital.

797
01:21:19,581 --> 01:21:23,914
I would very much like to commend
you for the charitable face...

798
01:21:23,997 --> 01:21:26,872
you have shown Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man.

799
01:21:26,956 --> 01:21:29,581
It is laudable
that you have provided...

800
01:21:29,664 --> 01:21:31,997
one of England's
most unfortunate sons...

801
01:21:32,081 --> 01:21:36,706
with a safe and tranquil harbor,
a home.

802
01:21:36,789 --> 01:21:38,664
For this immeasurable kindness...

803
01:21:38,747 --> 01:21:41,081
as well as the many
other acts of mercy...

804
01:21:41,206 --> 01:21:43,081
on behalf of the poor...

805
01:21:43,206 --> 01:21:47,289
of which Mr. Carr Gomm
has kept me informed...

806
01:21:47,414 --> 01:21:50,247
I gratefully thank you.

807
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:51,997
Signed, Victoria."

808
01:21:57,081 --> 01:22:01,414
I'm sure I can count on you
gentlemen to do the Christian thing.

809
01:22:01,539 --> 01:22:05,164
Thank you very much, ma'am.
I'm sure we shall all try.

810
01:22:06,414 --> 01:22:09,039
Gentlemen, I wish to move
that Mr. John Merrick...

811
01:22:09,122 --> 01:22:11,539
be admitted to this hospital
on a permanent basis...

812
01:22:11,622 --> 01:22:14,789
provided the hospital receives
a yearly sum...

813
01:22:14,914 --> 01:22:17,622
equal to the cost of
the occupation of one bed.

814
01:22:18,331 --> 01:22:20,539
All those in favor?

815
01:22:32,164 --> 01:22:35,206
Thank you, gentlemen.
The motion is carried.

816
01:22:41,372 --> 01:22:43,747
Yes. Come in!

817
01:22:49,206 --> 01:22:50,789
Good afternoon.

818
01:22:52,414 --> 01:22:55,206
Mr. Carr Gomm has something
he wants to say to you.

819
01:22:55,289 --> 01:22:57,747
Mr. Merrick,
I have very great pleasure...

820
01:22:57,831 --> 01:23:00,581
in being able
to welcome you officially...

821
01:23:00,664 --> 01:23:02,372
to the London Hospital.

822
01:23:02,456 --> 01:23:05,122
This morning, the governing
committee unanimously voted...

823
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:09,372
that you should be provided with
these rooms on a permanent basis.

824
01:23:09,456 --> 01:23:11,664
This is your home now.

825
01:23:11,747 --> 01:23:14,039
I'm so very, very glad for you.

826
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,456
Welcome home, lad.

827
01:23:20,664 --> 01:23:22,247
This is...

828
01:23:24,289 --> 01:23:25,706
my home?

829
01:23:25,789 --> 01:23:26,914
Yes.

830
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:31,956
Please, will you thank
the governing committee for me?

831
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:33,956
I will do my utmost...

832
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:36,997
to merit their kindness.

833
01:23:37,622 --> 01:23:39,706
This...

834
01:23:39,789 --> 01:23:41,956
is my home?

835
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:44,997
Yes. This as well.

836
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:53,664
Your dressing case.

837
01:24:02,831 --> 01:24:04,414
Oh, thank you.

838
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:12,914
Thanks, all my friends.

839
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:15,247
Thank you.

840
01:24:15,331 --> 01:24:18,539
- You like it?
- Oh, my friends.

841
01:24:24,081 --> 01:24:25,997
Oh, my friends.

842
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:31,039
Oh, thank you.

843
01:24:55,706 --> 01:24:58,122
- Who's next?
- I say.

844
01:24:59,539 --> 01:25:01,956
- What, you again?
- Yeah, but...

845
01:25:02,081 --> 01:25:05,414
But these young ladies
have never seen it.

846
01:25:08,706 --> 01:25:10,289
You're on, mate.

847
01:25:12,914 --> 01:25:16,164
Okay, that's it
for this performance.

848
01:25:16,247 --> 01:25:19,706
- Jim, can I go tonight?
- Sit down, Charlie.

849
01:25:21,081 --> 01:25:22,997
There's always tomorrow.
Don't worry.

850
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:29,206
Room for one more?

851
01:25:29,289 --> 01:25:31,247
At the right price.

852
01:25:33,122 --> 01:25:34,622
There's room.

853
01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:49,039
All right, all right!
Keep the noise down!

854
01:25:51,539 --> 01:25:53,997
We don't want
to frighten him, do we?

855
01:26:28,456 --> 01:26:30,747
Hello. My name...

856
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:35,081
is John Merrick...

857
01:26:35,164 --> 01:26:39,372
and I'm very, very pleased...

858
01:26:39,456 --> 01:26:41,914
to meet you.

859
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:48,622
I think you are...

860
01:26:48,747 --> 01:26:51,747
very beautiful...

861
01:26:55,331 --> 01:26:57,914
Curtain time!

862
01:26:57,997 --> 01:27:01,539
You look beautiful, darling.
I wouldn't change a thing.

863
01:27:02,664 --> 01:27:04,914
You look like
the bleedin' Prince of Wales.

864
01:27:06,914 --> 01:27:08,831
Here, my friends...

865
01:27:10,372 --> 01:27:12,081
is the Elephant Man!

866
01:27:15,206 --> 01:27:18,581
I told you he was horrible.

867
01:27:18,706 --> 01:27:20,289
Just horrible.

868
01:27:29,747 --> 01:27:32,831
Perhaps the ladies
would like a closer look?

869
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:36,497
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, Jack!

870
01:27:40,581 --> 01:27:42,164
There.

871
01:27:44,456 --> 01:27:47,581
He's quite a ladies' man, isn't he?

872
01:27:47,706 --> 01:27:51,706
Come on. Give the ladies' man
a little kiss, eh?

873
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:55,247
Come on.
Give him a kiss.

874
01:28:07,247 --> 01:28:09,956
Here, here, here!
That's enough romance.

875
01:28:10,081 --> 01:28:11,664
Time for beddy-byes.

876
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:03,914
All right, all right.
Keep the noise down.

877
01:29:04,039 --> 01:29:06,581
Now, keep it quiet.
Quiet! Hey!

878
01:29:06,664 --> 01:29:08,622
Keep it quiet.
Now, watch this.

879
01:29:53,247 --> 01:29:55,831
Okay, that's enough!
That's enough!

880
01:29:55,914 --> 01:29:58,081
That's it.
The show's over.

881
01:29:58,206 --> 01:30:00,122
I'll see you back
at the Peacock.

882
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:04,956
Get out of here.

883
01:30:31,997 --> 01:30:33,581
Here.

884
01:30:34,747 --> 01:30:36,331
Come on.

885
01:30:39,247 --> 01:30:42,164
There you are.
That's better, isn't it?

886
01:30:44,914 --> 01:30:47,539
I've done well tonight.

887
01:30:47,622 --> 01:30:50,622
Here. Buy yourself a sweet.

888
01:31:17,914 --> 01:31:19,331
My treasure.

889
01:32:38,414 --> 01:32:41,539
- I know what happened last night.
- What?

890
01:32:50,122 --> 01:32:52,247
Dear God.

891
01:32:52,331 --> 01:32:54,081
Boy!

892
01:33:11,331 --> 01:33:15,372
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?

893
01:33:20,789 --> 01:33:23,456
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?

894
01:33:25,581 --> 01:33:28,456
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Don't lie to me!

895
01:33:29,872 --> 01:33:33,081
I know all about it.
You were seen.

896
01:33:33,206 --> 01:33:35,081
You're involved with Bytes,
aren't you?

897
01:33:35,206 --> 01:33:38,039
You've taken him.
Where is he?

898
01:33:38,122 --> 01:33:41,081
Now, wait a minute.
I haven't taken him anywhere.

899
01:33:41,164 --> 01:33:44,706
I don't know no Bytes.
We were just having a bit of fun.

900
01:33:44,789 --> 01:33:46,747
We never hurt him.

901
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:48,747
You know, just having a laugh,
that's all.

902
01:33:48,872 --> 01:33:51,956
You bastard! He's gone!

903
01:33:52,081 --> 01:33:54,372
When I left him,
he was in bed safe and sound!

904
01:33:54,456 --> 01:33:57,747
You bastard!
You bastard!

905
01:33:57,831 --> 01:34:01,414
You're not listening to me!
I told you, I don't know no Bytes!

906
01:34:01,539 --> 01:34:03,289
I ain't done nothing wrong.

907
01:34:03,414 --> 01:34:07,081
People pay money to see
your monster. I collect it.

908
01:34:07,206 --> 01:34:09,331
You're the monster!
You're the freak!

909
01:34:09,414 --> 01:34:11,497
Now, get out!
You're finished!

910
01:34:11,581 --> 01:34:15,081
You don't frighten me,
you and your bleedin' Elephant Man.

911
01:34:16,622 --> 01:34:19,789
I'm glad what I done,
and you can do nothing about it.

912
01:34:19,914 --> 01:34:22,122
Only Mothershead can sack me now!

913
01:34:27,914 --> 01:34:29,539
Done.

914
01:34:46,247 --> 01:34:48,206
There's something
I'd like to tell you, Treves.

915
01:34:49,372 --> 01:34:53,164
You know, I felt as deeply
as you did about John.

916
01:34:53,247 --> 01:34:54,956
Well, now he's disappeared...

917
01:34:55,081 --> 01:34:57,247
very likely to the continent.

918
01:34:57,372 --> 01:34:59,581
There's no question
of your going after him.

919
01:34:59,664 --> 01:35:02,622
You're desperately needed here
by your patients.

920
01:35:02,747 --> 01:35:05,539
You did everything
in your power.

921
01:35:05,622 --> 01:35:07,622
Remember that, Treves.

922
01:35:07,747 --> 01:35:09,664
Everything in your power.

923
01:36:39,206 --> 01:36:40,789
Get the stool.

924
01:37:07,497 --> 01:37:09,039
Get up, you bastard.

925
01:37:34,872 --> 01:37:38,622
Look at all these
beautiful animals.

926
01:37:43,122 --> 01:37:45,581
What a lot you have.

927
01:37:57,581 --> 01:38:00,081
That sly bastard.

928
01:38:05,081 --> 01:38:08,331
He's doing this to spite me!

929
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:20,706
You're doing this to spite me...

930
01:38:20,789 --> 01:38:22,747
and it's got to stop!

931
01:38:22,831 --> 01:38:25,247
Bytes, he's sick!

932
01:38:25,372 --> 01:38:27,289
Let him die!

933
01:38:29,414 --> 01:38:32,164
But don't think
I'm going to bury that...

934
01:38:34,581 --> 01:38:36,247
bag of flesh!

935
01:38:36,331 --> 01:38:37,914
Wrong!

936
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:46,956
As a matter of fact...

937
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:56,206
- Bytes, no!
- As a matter of fact...

938
01:38:56,289 --> 01:38:58,247
Bytes, stop, please!

939
01:39:44,122 --> 01:39:46,622
Bytes, please, don't!

940
01:40:52,997 --> 01:40:54,581
We've decided...

941
01:40:57,831 --> 01:40:59,747
we're gonna get you out of here.

942
01:40:59,831 --> 01:41:01,956
All right?

943
01:41:28,414 --> 01:41:30,331
Good on you, mate.
Good on you.

944
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:51,414
Luck, my friend.

945
01:42:54,081 --> 01:42:57,331
Luck. And who needs it
more than we?

946
01:44:24,956 --> 01:44:27,039
Hey, mister.

947
01:44:28,372 --> 01:44:31,456
Mister, why is your head so big?

948
01:44:35,581 --> 01:44:37,539
Why is your head so big, mister?

949
01:44:40,831 --> 01:44:43,872
Why is your head so big?
Why won't you answer me?

950
01:44:50,247 --> 01:44:52,164
Why is your head so big, mister?

951
01:45:20,414 --> 01:45:22,372
Stop him!

952
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:22,581
I am not an animal!

953
01:46:24,456 --> 01:46:27,372
I am not an animal!

954
01:46:30,081 --> 01:46:33,706
I am a human being!

955
01:46:39,081 --> 01:46:41,872
I am...

956
01:46:41,956 --> 01:46:43,914
a man!

957
01:46:48,956 --> 01:46:50,914
Excuse me, sir.

958
01:46:50,997 --> 01:46:53,456
Out of the way, sir.
Excuse me.

959
01:46:56,456 --> 01:46:59,747
Mr. Treves, sir!
They found him!

960
01:46:59,831 --> 01:47:02,372
I think they found John!

961
01:47:13,872 --> 01:47:15,456
Thank you.

962
01:47:22,747 --> 01:47:25,456
- Keep still, girl.
- Sorry.

963
01:47:26,997 --> 01:47:30,581
That was very nice of Mrs. Kendal
to give me this dress for tonight.

964
01:47:30,706 --> 01:47:32,289
It's so beautiful.

965
01:47:35,747 --> 01:47:38,539
Does Mrs. Kendal know
that John is dying?

966
01:47:42,914 --> 01:47:44,372
Yes, she knows.

967
01:47:59,456 --> 01:48:01,914
How do I look?

968
01:48:01,997 --> 01:48:03,581
Splendid.

969
01:48:03,706 --> 01:48:07,747
Now, you will not look out of place.
You look absolutely splendid.

970
01:48:07,872 --> 01:48:11,747
- Oh, splendid. Shall we go?
- Yes.

971
01:48:12,789 --> 01:48:14,331
Again...

972
01:48:14,414 --> 01:48:18,414
I can't tell you how sorry I am
for what happened.

973
01:48:18,539 --> 01:48:21,997
You see, I had no idea, really.

974
01:48:22,081 --> 01:48:24,831
Please, you mustn't blame yourself.

975
01:48:24,914 --> 01:48:29,497
Mr. Treves, don't worry about me...

976
01:48:29,581 --> 01:48:31,747
my friend.

977
01:48:31,831 --> 01:48:37,247
I am happy every hour of the day.

978
01:48:37,372 --> 01:48:41,956
My life is full
because I know that I am loved.

979
01:48:45,789 --> 01:48:48,581
I have gained myself.

980
01:48:56,914 --> 01:49:00,581
I could not say that...

981
01:49:00,664 --> 01:49:02,706
were it not for you.

982
01:49:06,872 --> 01:49:10,247
Well, and I...

983
01:49:10,331 --> 01:49:14,164
You've done so much for me as well.

984
01:49:14,247 --> 01:49:15,872
Thank you.

985
01:49:18,206 --> 01:49:19,747
So...

986
01:49:20,914 --> 01:49:22,831
I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead
and Nora...

987
01:49:22,914 --> 01:49:25,497
and be back in a few minutes.

988
01:49:27,914 --> 01:49:29,872
Very good, my friend.

989
01:49:34,456 --> 01:49:36,414
My friend.

990
01:52:32,081 --> 01:52:34,331
Mrs. Kendal.

991
01:52:37,247 --> 01:52:39,414
Thank you.

992
01:52:39,497 --> 01:52:41,414
Your Royal Highness...

993
01:52:41,497 --> 01:52:43,247
ladies and gentlemen...

994
01:52:43,331 --> 01:52:45,789
tonight's performance
was very special to me...

995
01:52:45,914 --> 01:52:48,414
because it was very special
to someone else.

996
01:52:48,497 --> 01:52:51,497
A man who knows the theater
and who loves the theater...

997
01:52:51,581 --> 01:52:54,539
and yet this is the very first time
he's ever been here.

998
01:52:56,247 --> 01:52:57,539
I wish to dedicate...

999
01:52:57,622 --> 01:53:00,456
The whole company wishes to dedicate
with all their hearts...

1000
01:53:00,581 --> 01:53:02,956
tonight's performance...

1001
01:53:03,081 --> 01:53:04,997
to Mr. John Merrick...

1002
01:53:05,081 --> 01:53:07,081
my very dear friend.

1003
01:53:19,456 --> 01:53:22,414
Stand up.
They want to see you.

1004
01:53:22,497 --> 01:53:25,247
Go on. It's all right.
Just stand up.

1005
01:53:25,372 --> 01:53:27,289
They want to see you.

1006
01:54:03,706 --> 01:54:07,581
I really did believe that...

1007
01:54:07,706 --> 01:54:11,331
the ogre would never
get out of the dungeon.

1008
01:54:13,122 --> 01:54:16,622
Good.
So you really enjoyed yourself?

1009
01:54:19,414 --> 01:54:20,956
It was wonderful!

1010
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:25,831
Good. Then we must
go again some evening.

1011
01:54:25,914 --> 01:54:29,039
Oh, yes.
Oh, I hope so.

1012
01:54:29,122 --> 01:54:31,164
Yes, we will.
We will.

1013
01:54:32,706 --> 01:54:35,039
Good. I'm pleased.

1014
01:54:35,122 --> 01:54:38,914
Well, I ought to go.

1015
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:43,331
You must get some sleep.
Good night, and sleep well.

1016
01:54:45,539 --> 01:54:49,289
- And you too, my friend.
- Yes.

1017
01:54:49,414 --> 01:54:51,831
I'm so pleased
you enjoyed yourself.

1018
01:54:51,914 --> 01:54:54,039
Good night.

1019
01:54:57,497 --> 01:54:59,081
Good night.

1020
01:56:31,372 --> 01:56:32,914
It's finished.

1021
02:00:04,164 --> 02:00:08,414
Never, oh, never
nothing will die.

1022
02:00:08,539 --> 02:00:12,831
The stream flows,
the wind blows.

1023
02:00:12,914 --> 02:00:16,872
The cloud fleets,
the heart beats.

1024
02:00:38,247 --> 02:00:40,414
Nothing will die.
