1
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:11,635
Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu and Studio Ghibli present

2
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:20,853
In ancient times the land lay covered in forest.

3
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:27,901
Here dwelt the spirits of nature from time immemorial.

4
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:17,576
PRINCESS MONONOKE

5
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,298
Yakul!

6
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,055
Ashitaka!

7
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,683
Oracle says to get back to the village.

8
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,143
The Old Man, too.

9
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,480
- Something's wrong.
- The birds are gone.

10
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,564
The animals too.

11
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,860
I'll go to him. You'd better go now.

12
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,358
Something's coming.

13
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,411
- What is it?
- Don't know. It's not human.

14
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,706
Oracle summoned everyone back to the village.

15
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,125
There!

16
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,698
A demon god!

17
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,970
Yakul, run!

18
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,790
It'll attack the village!

19
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,125
Ashitaka!

20
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,629
Don't touch it!
Its curse will be on you!

21
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,673
Yakul!

22
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,781
Quiet your rage, I beg you!

23
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,661
O forest god who cannot be
without name, why do you rampage so?

24
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,513
- A monster!
- Run!

25
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,393
Stop! Leave our village in peace!

26
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,603
Stop! Still your rage!

27
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,151
Get up!

28
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,042
- It's down!
- Ashitaka!

29
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,293
Bring Oracle!

30
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,795
Stoke the fire!

31
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,547
Ashitaka.

32
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,470
Don't touch it.
It's no ordinary wound.

33
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,515
He's hurt! Where's Oracle?

34
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,559
All of you, stay back!

35
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,977
Oracle!

36
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,648
Pour this water on it, slowly.

37
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,957
O raging god unknown to us...

38
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,001
...I bow before you.

39
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:05,424
Where you have fallen, we will
raise a mound and perform rites.

40
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,510
Bear us no hate. Be at peace.

41
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,098
Hear me, loathsome humans!

42
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,978
You shall know my agony and my hatred.

43
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,479
This is very, very bad.

44
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,524
The boar-spirit came from far to the west.

45
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,778
A poison within him goaded him on, rotting his flesh...

46
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:14,951
...drawing evil as he ran,
making a demon of him.

47
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,454
Prince Ashitaka...

48
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,124
show us your right arm.

49
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,759
Oracle!

50
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:37,057
Ashitaka, are you ready to face your destiny?

51
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,810
Yes. I was resolved
when I let my arrow fly.

52
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,317
The poison will seep into your bones and you will die.

53
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,157
Can nothing be done?!

54
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,536
He fought for the women and the village!

55
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,955
To simply wait for death...

56
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,083
We cannot change our fate.

57
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:07,087
But we can rise to meet it.

58
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,922
Look.

59
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,469
This was deep in the boar's body.

60
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,806
His suffering was terrible.

61
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,017
The iron shattered his bones and tore his entrails.

62
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,853
What else could have made him that way?

63
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,817
Something sinister waits in the lands to the west.

64
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,155
If you journey there and
search for evil with eyes unclouded...

65
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,285
you might find a way to lift the curse.

66
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,248
More than 500 years have passed...

67
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:47,377
since the Emperor drove us into this land.

68
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,089
Now we hear how his power fades...

69
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,676
and the fangs of his Shoguns are broken.

70
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:59,681
But the blood of our tribe likewise grows thin.

71
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:05,312
And now, bitter fate...
the youth who was one day to lead us

72
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,815
must journey far to the west.

73
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:29,002
The Law forbids us
to watch you go. Farewell.

74
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,494
- Ashitaka.
- Kaya, you can't be here.

75
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,998
I don't care.
Remember me with this.

76
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,713
Your jewel dagger.

77
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,508
It will protect you.

78
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:21,471
You'll always be in my heart.
Always, without fail.

79
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,724
And you in mine, Kaya.

80
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,732
Fighting?

81
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,366
Head them off!

82
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,163
There's one, get him!

83
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,248
His head is mine!

84
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,052
Stop!

85
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,853
My arm!

86
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,607
Don't let him get away.

87
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,193
Stay back. Let me pass!

88
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,626
A demon!

89
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,808
The mark is getting darker.

90
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,822
This gruel tastes like hot water.

91
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,828
There he is!

92
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,586
Is this enough?

93
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,005
This isn't money.

94
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,382
Give me back my rice!

95
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,427
Here, let me take a look.

96
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,892
Woman, this is pure gold!

97
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,187
If it's coins you want, I'll pay you.

98
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,647
Give me this.

99
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,027
Listen, is there
a money-changer here?

100
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,945
No?

101
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:11,701
I'm a simple priest, but I'd say
this is worth three sacks of rice.

102
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,119
Hey, wait!

103
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,163
That's mine, give it back!

104
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,417
Wait, don't be in such a hurry.

105
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:25,548
No need to thank me.
It is I who should thank you.

106
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:30,178
I saw how you dealt with those samurai.

107
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,891
You fight like one possessed.

108
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,357
You see them too?
Keep your gold hidden.

109
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,110
Hearts have grown hard throughout the land.

110
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,739
They'll rob you in your sleep.
Shall we run?

111
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,379
So the boar became a demon...

112
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:09,842
I followed its tracks, but lost them in the village.

113
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,344
I'm not surprised.

114
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,054
Look around you.

115
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:19,060
This used to be a fine village.

116
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:24,357
There was a flood, maybe,
or a landslide. I'm sure many died.

117
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,487
The land teems with bitter ghosts...

118
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,950
...dead from war, sick or starved
and fallen where they stood.

119
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,204
A curse, you say? This world is a curse.

120
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,709
Ah, this is good!

121
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:48,172
I shouldn't have gotten into
that fight. I killed two men.

122
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,758
You helped me escape.

123
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,720
Give me your bowl.
You need food.

124
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,513
Everyone dies.

125
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,016
Some now, some later.

126
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,393
Hmm, an elegant bowl.

127
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:05,523
You remind me of the Emishi of old.

128
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,651
A brave people far to the east...

129
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,780
who used stone arrowheads and rode red elk.

130
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,165
The trick is to avoid the jaws of death.

131
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,668
Or so my master used to say.

132
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,463
Eat, my boy. It's your rice.

133
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,633
Look at this.

134
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,139
What is it?

135
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,725
It was in the body of the giant boar.

136
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,978
This is what killed him.

137
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,075
Far to the west, deep in the mountains...

138
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,120
is a forest where none may tread.

139
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,332
- The forest of the Deer God.
- The Deer God?

140
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,170
They say the beasts there are giants, as in ages past.

141
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,498
I knew he'd go...

142
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,200
It's not far now.
Stay on your guard.

143
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,536
They're coming.

144
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,037
The wolves!

145
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,923
Calm the oxen. Don't rush.
Form ranks.

146
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,176
Keep your powder dry!

147
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,678
Wait until they're close.

148
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,062
Number One, fire!

149
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,749
Number Two, fire!

150
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,716
That was too easy.

151
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,220
Those were just the pups.
Where's the mother?

152
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,353
It's Moro.

153
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,277
Come on, Moro!

154
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,209
Got her!

155
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,796
She's immortal.
She won't die from that.

156
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,305
She did some real damage.

157
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,890
Let's get going.

158
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,767
What about those who fell?

159
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,560
Form ranks and move out.

160
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,999
He's breathing.

161
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,251
Hang on!

162
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,317
My name is Ashitaka!
I come from the east.

163
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,571
Are you ancient gods from the forest of the Deer God?

164
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,172
Leave!

165
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,112
A kodama? Are they here, too?

166
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,991
Don't move. You're hurt.

167
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,875
They won't harm you.
They're a sign the woods are healthy.

168
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,253
They'll bring the Deer God.

169
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,630
The Deer God? The giant wolf?

170
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,801
No, far bigger. The mother of all beasts.

171
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,430
It's gone!

172
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,939
Yakul's not afraid.
There's no danger here.

173
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,194
Please let us pass through your woods.

174
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,375
Let's go back. Please!

175
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:26,464
There's a trail across the river.
We'll never get through these woods.

176
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,008
The current's too strong to cross.

177
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,970
If we don't get help soon, this man will die.

178
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,770
Are you guiding us or getting us lost?

179
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:00,206
Sir, these sprites aren't helping us.

180
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,333
There are more of them!

181
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,814
What a magnificent tree.
Is she your mother?

182
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,777
That girl and the wolves...
so this is where they live...

183
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,865
We're getting in deeper, sir.
This way leads into the other world.

184
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,285
Yes, let's take a rest.

185
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,131
Footprints.

186
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,600
Three toes... still fresh.

187
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,821
What's wrong, sir?

188
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:15,150
Are you all right?
You're awfully pale.

189
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,736
I told you!

190
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,947
Did you see something?

191
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,699
No, forget it.

192
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,869
Hang on a little longer.

193
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,579
I'm sorry.

194
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,004
It's gone.

195
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,969
What is this? I feel much stronger.

196
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,763
Hey! It doesn't hurt.

197
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,767
I'm cured! No, it's broken.

198
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:58,819
Sir, you're a genius.
We're back at the ironworks!

199
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,354
- It's a castle.
- Lady Eboshi's ironworks.

200
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,483
They melt sand into iron.

201
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,401
Hey!

202
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,408
- Someone's coming from the woods!
- A monster?

203
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,829
It's me, Koroku the ox-driver!

204
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,669
It's true, he's crossing the lake!

205
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:03,300
What's all this noise?
Be quiet when I'm writing.

206
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,345
Koroku's back from the dead!

207
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,596
What?

208
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,318
You're not a ghost.

209
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,363
- Where are the others?
- There were two more.

210
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,615
Only we were saved.

211
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,037
The guards never get killed.

212
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,664
Step aside.

213
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,376
Who's the man in the hood, sir?

214
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,253
An outsider.

215
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:46,009
Riflemen, listen! This gentleman
carried us all the way here.

216
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,095
Show some gratitude.

217
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,640
Ouch! Don't grab me there.

218
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,144
You! Wait there!

219
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,909
First, I thank you for helping our men.

220
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,078
But something bothers me.

221
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,915
You got here in less than half the time we did...

222
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,210
...through the Deer God's forest,
carrying two...

223
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,754
Koroku! You're alive!

224
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,298
Toki!

225
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,847
You fool! How can you drive
oxen with that broken leg?

226
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,098
But...

227
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,311
Scaring me half to death!
The wolves should've eaten you.

228
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,479
Then I could find a better man.

229
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,566
Don't be so hard on me, Toki.

230
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,527
Toki, take your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.

231
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,072
And you, leaving them to die!

232
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,784
Some guard you are.
You don't lift a finger around here.

233
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,870
When there's trouble, do something!

234
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,914
It couldn't be helped...

235
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,584
Thank you. My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe.

236
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,755
Good. I was afraid maybe
I'd done something wrong.

237
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,763
You seem very handsome.
Show us your face.

238
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,847
Gonza.

239
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:19,102
I would like to thank the traveler.
Bring him to me later.

240
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,479
Koroku.

241
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,858
It's good you're back. I apologize.

242
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,489
Don't say that, Lady Eboshi.
He'll just take advantage of you.

243
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:35,494
Forgive me, Toki.
I shouldn't have let it happen.

244
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,163
My lady, if you hadn't been there...

245
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,500
they'd all be cavorting inside the wolves by now.

246
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,922
Traveler, please stop and rest.

247
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,262
Hey! You are handsome!

248
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,918
We had to fight off Moro to bring this rice, you know.

249
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,545
Dish it out!

250
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,715
Where?

251
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,299
Is that him?

252
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,844
Toki was right!

253
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,263
- He is handsome!
- A bit young.

254
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,807
That never stopped you before.

255
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,727
Quiet out there. We lost two men.

256
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,104
There are plenty of handsome men here.

257
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,106
Cowherds!

258
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:51,278
Come to our place, traveler!
Forget this stinking barn.

259
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,991
Watch your mouth! We risked our lives
for the rice you're eating.

260
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,119
Who made the iron that bought the rice?

261
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,747
We work those bellows all night long.

262
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,625
I'd like to see where you work, if you don't mind.

263
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:06,543
Really?

264
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,920
We'll have to work in makeup.

265
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,756
Even rouge!

266
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,843
Don't forget, we'll be waiting.

267
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,680
Don't mind them, sir.

268
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,601
Lady Eboshi spoils them.

269
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,103
A good village has happy women.

270
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,607
But women working the bellows in an ironworks?

271
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,860
Their presence defiles the iron.

272
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:36,364
When she finds girls sold as slaves,
Eboshi buys their freedom.

273
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,492
She's kind, that's all.

274
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,535
There's rice on your face, old man.

275
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:44,664
But she's not afraid of ancient laws, or of curses.

276
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,667
Or of wolves, either.

277
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,712
You should've seen her fighting Nago!

278
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,797
Nago?

279
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:55,884
A huge boar-god. He ruled
the forest around here.

280
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,637
We couldn't go into the mountains.

281
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,265
All we could do was look up at them.

282
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,144
We used up the iron in the sand by the lake.

283
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:11,191
Many people had their eye on this
place. The boars got them all.

284
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:15,153
To get sand, we have to clear the trees.

285
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,447
Nago went wild.

286
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,591
There they go again!

287
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,888
Then Lady Eboshi came along with her muskets.

288
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,001
Sir? What's wrong?

289
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,131
Does your arm hurt?

290
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,384
I was thinking about that boar.

291
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,180
He must have died full of hate.

292
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,147
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, Ashitaka.

293
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,607
That's good iron.

294
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,735
We had to make tomorrow's shipment.

295
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,115
Let's rest now. Tell the others.

296
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,329
Some think you're spying
for the samurai, or the monsters.

297
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,916
There are many who covet our iron.

298
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,585
May I ask why you're here?

299
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,927
You must recognize this.

300
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:07,933
It shattered the bones of a giant boar,
rotted his flesh and made him a monster.

301
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:13,438
When I tried to stop him, I was left
with this scar, a curse unto death.

302
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,442
Where is your land? I've never seen
an elk like yours.

303
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,571
Between north and east.
That's all I will say.

304
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:25,450
Why, you! Answer her
or I'll cut you in two!

305
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,787
And when you find the one who made that?

306
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,666
I will see with eyes unclouded, and decide.

307
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,168
Eyes unclouded?

308
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,508
I see.

309
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,052
I'll show you my secret. Come.

310
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,303
Lady Eboshi!

311
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,222
Take over, Gonza.

312
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,369
No one dares enter this garden.

313
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,039
Come, if you would know my secret.

314
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,673
We're coming in.

315
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,558
We just finished.

316
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,478
It's still heavy.

317
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,356
It's light in your hands.

318
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,359
If the barrel's too thin, it will burst.

319
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:27,072
It's not just for me.
The women will be using them.

320
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,574
Won't that be a sight!

321
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,328
This is the new musket these people have designed.

322
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,705
Chinese muskets are too heavy.

323
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,709
This will kill monsters and pierce samurai armor.

324
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:44,089
Watch out. Lady Eboshi
wants to rule the country.

325
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,009
I'm sorry to rush you.
I'll send sake later.

326
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,844
Won't that be nice!

327
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:55,183
You stole the boar's woods and made a monster of him.

328
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,853
Will you breed new hatred and evil with those weapons?

329
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,815
I'm sorry you suffer.

330
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,776
The musket ball you found is mine.

331
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,863
That hapless boar should have cursed me instead.

332
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,592
Your right hand wants to kill me?

333
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,470
Perhaps that would lift this curse.

334
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,140
But my hand would not be stayed.

335
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,268
Must it kill us all to find peace?

336
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,772
My lady, Osa wants to say something.

337
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:48,361
Lady Eboshi, do not scorn the young man's strength.

338
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:53,158
Young man, I too am cursed.

339
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,911
I understand your rage and grief...

340
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:01,207
but I beg you not to kill our lady.

341
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:07,964
She is the only person who ever treated us as human.

342
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,217
She did not fear our disease.

343
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:15,847
She washed and bandaged our flesh.

344
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:23,938
- Osa...
- Life is suffering and pain.

345
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:28,526
This world and its people are
cursed, but we still wish to live.

346
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,446
Forgive my foolish babbling.

347
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,425
They're back.

348
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,097
They come at night to plant trees
and take back the mountain.

349
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,601
Ashitaka, will you stay, and work with me?

350
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,854
Would you seize even the Deer God's forest?

351
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:09,192
Without the ancient gods, the wild ones are mere beasts.

352
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:14,989
With the forest and wolves gone,
this will be a land of riches.

353
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,575
Even Princess Mononoke will be human again.

354
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,244
Princess Mononoke?

355
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,914
The wild girl whose soul the wolves stole.

356
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,625
She lives to kill me.

357
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,467
The blood of the Deer God is said to cure disease.

358
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:40,265
Perhaps it could cure these people, even lift your curse.

359
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,849
Lady Eboshi!

360
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,269
How does it handle?

361
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,939
Very well made.
Perfect for conquering the country.

362
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,776
- But still a bit heavy.
- Hard to please.

363
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,847
Look who's here!

364
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,474
Toki, let me try the bellows.

365
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,143
Wait!

366
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,355
May I try?

367
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,817
Let him see what it's like.

368
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,993
What strength!

369
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,206
You really came!

370
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,334
I told you he's an handsome man.

371
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,128
Look, she's fixing her kimono!

372
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,049
You'll never keep up that pace, traveler.

373
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,426
It's hard work.

374
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,179
Yes, we work four days straight.

375
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,806
Is life hard here?

376
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:08,353
Yes, but it's better than in the towns.

377
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,315
We eat our fill and the men know their place.

378
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,900
I see.

379
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,073
- You're leaving tomorrow?
- You should stay longer.

380
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,741
You can help us.

381
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:07,120
Thank you, but there is someone I must meet.

382
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,086
She's here.

383
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,051
Princess Mononoke!

384
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,090
It's her!

385
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,800
Stop!

386
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,428
I don't want to fight you!

387
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,685
She's after the Lady!

388
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:27,700
Stoke the fires.
Riflemen, keep her inside!

389
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,037
Steady at your posts!

390
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,331
She's up on the roof.

391
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,417
Don't get excited. Keep working.

392
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,544
We must keep the fire going.

393
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:43,049
- Is she alone?
- Yes. We have her cornered.

394
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,343
She came for you.

395
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,720
All right, let's go.

396
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,608
Can you hear me,
Princess Mononoke? Here I am.

397
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,278
You wish to avenge your tribe.

398
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,991
There are some here who seek vengeance for husbands...

399
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,244
killed by your wolves.

400
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,080
Come out!
We have scores to settle!

401
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,466
There she is!

402
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,761
Surrender, Princess Mononoke!

403
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,973
Stay out of the line of fire!

404
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,773
It's a trap. Stop!

405
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,903
Wolf princess, go back to your woods!

406
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,243
Don't die for nothing.
Go back!

407
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,078
I knew it!

408
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,205
Let him do as he likes.

409
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,270
Got her! She's falling.

410
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,771
Don't move.

411
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,191
A wolf's severed head can still bite.

412
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,945
Aim where she falls.

413
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,007
Fire!

414
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,476
Stay back!

415
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,319
Wake up!

416
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,451
No!

417
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,721
Get her!

418
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,640
Don't let her go.

419
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,100
Kill her!

420
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,106
Are you all right, sir?

421
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,367
Don't worry about me. Go!

422
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,751
Villain! You're one of them too.

423
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,505
Halt!

424
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,927
Step aside.

425
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,946
What are you doing, Ashitaka?

426
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,073
Her life is mine.

427
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,036
Will you marry the wolf princess?

428
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,622
There is a demon inside you.
And in her.

429
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:53,591
Look! This is the hatred
and bitterness that curses me!

430
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,094
It rots my flesh and summons my death.

431
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,097
You cannot yield to it.

432
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,017
Enough talk of your curse.

433
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,935
I'll cut that arm off!

434
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,400
Lady Eboshi!

435
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,197
Someone help me.

436
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,705
Don't worry. She'll recover.

437
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,129
I will take the girl!

438
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:36,133
Wait! You hurt Lady Eboshi!

439
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,513
Don't move!

440
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,526
Kiyo, no!

441
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,075
He still lives...

442
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,750
- And Lady Eboshi?
- Safe, sir.

443
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,921
Bring me my musket.
Sharpshooters, fall in!

444
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,006
They won't get away.

445
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,717
Toki, quick!

446
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,891
You're...

447
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,700
Sir, you may not pass.

448
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,703
The gate may not be opened without orders.

449
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,708
Please turn back.

450
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,378
You helped us.
We don't want to harm you.

451
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,508
I will leave as I came, of my own will.

452
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,013
No... it takes ten men
to open that gate.

453
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,023
Sir, no! You'll die!

454
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,783
It's moving...

455
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,459
Out of the way!

456
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,380
Wolves!

457
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,007
Flint! Flint!

458
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,885
Stop. Your princess is safe!

459
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,097
We're coming.

460
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,515
Yakul, let's go.

461
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,855
Thank you.

462
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,489
He's gone.

463
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,429
Wait!

464
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,891
He's mine.

465
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,156
Did they shoot you?
Are you going to die?

466
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:53,330
Why did you stop me?
Speak while you still live!

467
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,835
I didn't want you to die.

468
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:02,089
I'm not afraid to die if it will drive away the humans!

469
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,592
I knew that when I first saw you.

470
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,679
You've wasted your life by getting in my way!

471
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:16,353
I'll cut your throat!
That'll shut you up.

472
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,856
Live...

473
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,483
I don't listen to humans!

474
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,987
You're beautiful...

475
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,037
What's wrong, San?
Shall I tear him apart?

476
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,216
It's the apes.

477
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,805
Apes! Do you insult
the tribe of Moro?

478
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,059
This forest ours.

479
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,269
Give us man.

480
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:00,773
Give us man and go.

481
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,400
Be gone before my fangs find you.

482
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,361
Go.

483
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,613
We eat man.

484
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,406
We eat him.

485
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,533
Let us eat man.

486
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:15,621
Why would the tribe of the apes...

487
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,123
...want to eat a man?

488
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:23,087
We eat man. We get his strength.

489
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:26,924
We get strength to drive humans away.

490
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:31,095
You won't get that power by eating a man.

491
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:35,557
All that will do is defile you
and turn you into something else!

492
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:40,062
We plant trees. Humans kill them.

493
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:45,192
Forest not come back.
We kill humans.

494
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:49,613
The Deer God is with us.
Don't give up. Plant your trees.

495
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,199
Moro's tribe is fighting for you!

496
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:56,578
Deer God not fight. We die.

497
00:56:56,704 --> 00:57:00,207
Wolf girl not care. Wolf girl human.

498
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,962
Monkey! I'll break your neck!

499
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,425
Stop it!

500
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,977
It's all right.

501
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:24,148
You go ahead.
I'll deal with the human.

502
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,649
What about him?

503
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,693
Can we eat him?

504
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,990
No, you can't. Now go on.

505
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,708
Come here. Let's be friends.

506
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,879
Help me carry your master.

507
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:46,039
You're smart. You know
not to set foot on this island.

508
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,293
That human stench.

509
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,805
Go where you will. You're free.

510
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:36,858
There he is!

511
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:39,611
At last, the Nightwalker!

512
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,947
Quick, come and look.

513
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,826
That's why we've been sitting
in these stinking bearskins.

514
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,662
Don't look, you'll go blind!

515
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,915
And you call yourselves hunters?

516
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,835
This decree from the Emperor...

517
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,921
...allows us to subdue the Deer God!

518
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:06,263
Now he's the Nightwalker.

519
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:11,435
When day begins, he becomes a deer again.

520
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,895
He's going in. There!

521
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,189
- Jiko!
- I saw them.

522
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,691
Over there.

523
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,249
There must be hundreds of them.

524
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,584
They're not from these woods.

525
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,587
They're lords of some other forest.

526
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:11,930
It's Okkoto!

527
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,766
He swam across the straits?

528
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:17,060
No other boar has those tusks.

529
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,855
He brought his whole tribe.

530
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,569
He knows we're here. Run!

531
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,917
Come on, jump!

532
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:35,639
There's no wound.

533
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,567
Yakul...

534
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:15,512
If you're awake, thank Yakul.
He never left your side.

535
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,265
You know his name?

536
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:25,188
He told me all about you,
about your village and its forest.

537
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:29,192
I'll help you, because the Deer God saved your life.

538
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,990
I had a dream... a golden deer...

539
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,032
Eat this.

540
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:42,914
Chew.

541
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,091
We're here to kill humans and save the forest.

542
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,426
Why are humans here?

543
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,595
She is San, my daughter.

544
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,139
There are humans everywhere.

545
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:26,684
Go back to your homeland and kill them there.

546
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:30,396
We kill for the forest of the Deer God.

547
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,149
Why is the man here?

548
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:38,113
The Deer God healed him.
He should leave here alive.

549
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:43,493
The Deer God saved him?
The Deer God healed a human?

550
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,913
Why did he not save Nago?

551
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:51,000
Does the Deer God not protect all in the forest?

552
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:55,171
The Deer God gives life and takes it away.

553
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:59,217
Have you boars forgotten that?

554
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:03,805
You begrudge us the Deer God's favor.

555
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,974
You did nothing to help Nago!

556
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:10,478
He feared death, as do I.

557
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:14,983
I also carry within me a poisoned human stone.

558
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:19,445
Nago fled. I will stay
here and face my death.

559
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,364
Ask the Deer God for help.

560
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,701
I have lived long enough, San.

561
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:28,329
The Deer God would probably take my life.

562
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:31,583
No, Mother!
You protect the Deer God.

563
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:35,378
You lie!
Nago was beautiful and strong.

564
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,005
Our brother would never run.

565
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,300
You wolves ate him!

566
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,553
Silence! You slander my mother!

567
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,806
Hear me, all of you.

568
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,685
It was I who killed Nago.

569
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:55,148
He became a demon and attacked our village.

570
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,444
A huge boar. Here is my proof.

571
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:09,162
I came to this land to ask
the Deer God to lift this curse.

572
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,958
He healed my wound, but Nago's curse remains.

573
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:19,380
I must suffer until his curse destroys me.

574
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:28,348
Ah, it's Okkoto.
Finally, someone with some sense.

575
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:34,145
Okkoto, wait!

576
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,272
You mustn't eat him.

577
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:42,820
You are Moro's daughter.
I have heard of you.

578
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:45,823
Your eyes...

579
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,035
Stand back. I will not eat him.

580
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:50,828
Wolf Princess...

581
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:55,291
Fear not. I tell of Nago's end.

582
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,933
My thanks to you, young one.

583
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:18,314
It grieves us that our tribe spawned a demon.

584
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:24,153
Lord Okkoto, how I may lift the curse?

585
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:26,656
Leave this forest.

586
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,910
If we meet again, I must kill you.

587
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:35,748
You cannot win against the fire stones of the humans.

588
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:41,337
Look on my tribe, Moro.
We grow small and stupid.

589
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:44,924
Soon we will be nothing more...

590
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,635
...than game
for the humans to hunt.

591
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:52,598
If you stake everything on one battle,
you'll play into their hands.

592
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:56,269
I seek no help from wolves.

593
01:11:56,854 --> 01:12:03,026
Even if we all fall in battle,
we will leave the humans in awe.

594
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,053
The Deer God...

595
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,780
Keep the oxen together!

596
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:54,285
Hold your fire. Let them come.

597
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:56,120
Fire!

598
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:03,920
Reload! Quick!

599
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:22,522
That damned Eboshi's fighting the wrong enemy.

600
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,358
Go on ahead and hide.

601
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,965
It's them! They've returned.

602
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,723
- Jiko!
- Well done.

603
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:01,811
We're moving out. Tell the others.

604
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,442
Hello, Jiko.

605
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,944
His Majesty is impatient.

606
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,488
This is no time for sport with country samurai.

607
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:16,284
Lord Asano sends them against me.

608
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:19,495
Asano? He's a powerful man.

609
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,914
He wants half my iron.

610
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,125
How greedy of him.

611
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,295
This is no time to fight men.

612
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,756
The boars are gathering in the forest.

613
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,634
Give Asano all your iron.

614
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,763
Keep your promise to His Majesty, then smash Asano.

615
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,392
Quick, Lady Eboshi!
Asano's men are coming.

616
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:49,358
Speak of the devil. A messenger.

617
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:52,028
An envoy approaches.
Remember your manners.

618
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:56,782
Welcome home!

619
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,746
Aren't you going to receive him?

620
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:10,755
Mistress Eboshi of the Ironworks, you fight well!

621
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:16,385
I bring a message from my lord.
Open the gate!

622
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:19,305
We can hear you from there.

623
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,391
Our lady took this mountain from the boars.

624
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,894
Now it's worth something and you want it.

625
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,312
On your way!

626
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:29,315
You are impudent, woman!

627
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:30,650
Impudent?

628
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,237
We've been impudent since the day we were born!

629
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:38,074
You want iron? Take some!

630
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,168
Eboshi's women are quite impressive!

631
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,213
Samurai or monsters, they don't care.

632
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:56,342
They certainly don't lack for courage.

633
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:00,096
What good is this paper?

634
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:03,724
It's helped me get the best hunters and trackers.

635
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:06,686
We're after a god, not just beasts.

636
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,981
Yes, my lady?

637
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:12,858
Do you know who this comes from?

638
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:16,529
- The Son of Heaven.
- The what?

639
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:19,198
The Emperor.

640
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,077
Oh, it's nothing special.

641
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:24,787
Off you go.

642
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:31,085
The more we make iron, the weaker the forest becomes.

643
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:33,588
We lose fewer lives.

644
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,591
We've spent too much time and money.

645
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:40,636
We didn't send 40 sharpshooters just for the iron.

646
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,681
At least that's what His Majesty would say.

647
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:49,103
Surely he doesn't believe that the
head of a god confers immortality?

648
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:54,859
I'm not privy to his thoughts.
I prefer it that way.

649
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,403
I'll keep my promise.

650
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:02,116
Boars are easier to deal with than Moro and her tribe.

651
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:06,871
You can summon that shady bunch hidden under the cliff.

652
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:11,417
You saw them, did you?

653
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:13,878
One more thing...

654
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,672
Did a young man pass through here?

655
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,967
A strange youth, riding a red elk.

656
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,802
He left.

657
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:43,282
They look frightening.

658
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:46,702
They're not ordinary hunters.
They're special scouts.

659
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,039
Let us go with you.

660
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,999
Don't trust those men!

661
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,211
We can't help you from here if anything happens!

662
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,254
We know how to shoot.

663
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:00,883
That's why I need you here.

664
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:04,512
I fear humans more than monsters.

665
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,599
With the Deer God dead, things will become clear.

666
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:13,396
Is the Deer God's head all the Emperor really wants?

667
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:17,983
We may have to fight men with muskets, too.

668
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,987
Men can't be trusted.
Stay on your toes.

669
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:26,826
Don't worry about Lady Eboshi.
I'll protect her with my life.

670
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:29,370
- I wonder.
- What!

671
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:31,747
I'd believe that coming from a woman!

672
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,486
Are you suffering?

673
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:49,158
You could simply jump and end the pain, you know.

674
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,745
When your strength returns, the curse will torment you.

675
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,998
I feel like I've slept for days.

676
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,752
I dreamed San was watching over me.

677
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:06,592
I hoped you would cry out in your
sleep, so I could bite off your head.

678
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,344
These woods are beautiful.

679
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:10,763
Are the boars moving yet?

680
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:15,017
Go back into the cave, boy.
You can't hear it...

681
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:18,270
The forest crying out as the boars move forward.

682
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:24,026
I hear the forest crying and
feel the wasting of my body...

683
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,195
and I wait for that woman.

684
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:30,366
I dream of crushing her head in my jaws.

685
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,161
Can't humans and the forest live in peace?

686
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,372
Can't this be stopped?

687
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,749
The humans are gathering.

688
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:41,752
We're not safe, even here.

689
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:45,256
And San? Will you force her
to die with you?

690
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:49,260
How like a human.
You think only of yourself.

691
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:55,766
She is a daughter of our tribe.
If the woods die, so will she.

692
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,519
Set her free! She's human.

693
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,145
Silence, boy!

694
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:03,232
What can you do for her?

695
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:10,239
The humans who violated the forest
threw her in my path as they ran from me.

696
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,742
Now she is neither human nor wolf.

697
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:17,538
My poor, ugly, lovely daughter.

698
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,665
Can you save her?

699
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,879
I don't know, but together we can live.

700
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:32,052
How? Will you join San
and fight the humans?

701
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:35,264
No. That will only
breed more hatred.

702
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:40,227
There is nothing you can do.

703
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,647
Soon Nago's curse will kill you.

704
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:46,275
Leave this place at sunrise.

705
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,540
Can you walk?

706
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:07,046
Yes, thanks to you and the Deer God.

707
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,317
Yakul! Did you worry?

708
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:17,616
My legs are still weak.

709
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,276
It's too quiet.
Where are the kodama?

710
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:01,410
I can smell the ironworks.

711
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:11,920
Thank you for guiding me.
I have a favor to ask.

712
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,425
Give this to San.

713
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:25,893
Let's go.

714
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:59,885
What a stench! I can't breathe.

715
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:04,890
That's tracker's smoke.
It will blunt our sense of smell.

716
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,058
It's her.

717
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:19,696
- She knows we're here.
- It's a trap.

718
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:20,697
Trap?

719
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:25,160
They want to lure the boars out of the woods.

720
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,204
Everything has been planned.

721
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:29,957
We've got to warn them.

722
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,250
They'll die!

723
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:34,086
Okkoto is no fool.

724
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:38,715
The boars know it's a trap, but still they'll charge.

725
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,426
They are a proud race.

726
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:46,056
The last one alive will keep charging forward.

727
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,646
They're cutting trees.

728
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,481
Another provocation.

729
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,528
Mother, this is farewell.

730
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:02,364
The smoke will blind Okkoto.

731
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,408
I'll be his eyes.

732
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:06,702
As you like, San.

733
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:10,998
But there is a life for you with that boy.

734
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,958
I hate humans!

735
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:27,389
From Ashitaka... for me?

736
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:32,853
It's beautiful.

737
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:35,355
You two go with San.

738
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:38,066
I will stay with the Deer God.

739
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:39,234
Let's go.

740
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:04,051
The tribe of Moro fights with you!
Where is Okkoto?

741
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,222
Thank you!

742
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,600
It's coming from the ironworks.

743
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:42,190
Let's go.

744
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:47,529
Halt!

745
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:48,822
Samurai!

746
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:51,908
Halt!

747
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:54,077
Let me pass!

748
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:12,554
I don't believe it.

749
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,685
He's fending them off.

750
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,438
Don't waste your arrows.

751
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:46,630
Quick!

752
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:49,633
- You're right, it is him.
- It's not a ghost.

753
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,718
Ashitaka!

754
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:54,596
Toki! Are you all right?

755
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,306
Of course!

756
01:29:56,474 --> 01:30:00,685
They thought they'd catch us while the men were away.

757
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,062
We showed 'em!

758
01:30:02,438 --> 01:30:05,565
- They thought we'd be easy.
- Where's Lady Eboshi?

759
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:09,986
She took every man and went after the Deer God.

760
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:12,364
We're trapped here and can't reach her.

761
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:15,575
The Deer God?
So that's what I heard.

762
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:18,286
Sir, I've still got your bow.

763
01:30:18,454 --> 01:30:20,872
What about his saddle and cloak?

764
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:22,874
- I forgot.
- You're useless!

765
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:24,793
Koroku, thanks!

766
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:27,879
I'll bring help. Can you hold on?

767
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:31,174
We'll pour hot iron on them if we have to!

768
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,428
- Hurry, Ashitaka!
- Bring Lady Eboshi.

769
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:41,268
Missed!

770
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,395
They're bringing boats. Hurry!

771
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:47,315
Summon Lady Eboshi. We'll fight, too!

772
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:51,069
I'll be back. Keep fighting!

773
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,657
We'll be here!

774
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:01,705
Kill that man!

775
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,799
They're after us, Yakul!

776
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:57,385
Burning flesh...

777
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:04,726
Yakul!

778
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:45,183
Stay back!

779
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,531
Show me the wound.

780
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:04,452
Wait here. I'll be back.

781
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:08,456
Stay, I said!

782
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,344
We're almost there.

783
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:07,098
Who goes there?

784
01:34:07,683 --> 01:34:11,227
You're not allowed here.

785
01:34:11,937 --> 01:34:16,733
I'm indebted to these men.
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.

786
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:20,987
She's not here.
I'll see that she gets it.

787
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,865
I will speak to her.
Where is she?

788
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:27,369
Ashitaka, you made it after all!

789
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,871
You've suffered badly.

790
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:31,873
Some men are still buried.

791
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,333
It was horrible.

792
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:35,794
The ironworks are under attack.

793
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:40,757
There's still time. The women are
holding the inner stockade.

794
01:34:40,966 --> 01:34:42,217
This cannot stand!

795
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,844
Asano waited until we left.

796
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,805
Where's Lady Eboshi?

797
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,724
She went after the Deer God.

798
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,851
Call her back. There's no time!

799
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:55,980
If you're finished, get moving.
Get back to work!

800
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:57,565
And the ironworks?

801
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:59,317
Now wait a minute!

802
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:02,195
They're ready to sacrifice us all.

803
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:06,574
- There's no time to lose.
- Send Eboshi a message!

804
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:09,953
She's deep in the woods.
We'll never find her.

805
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:12,956
Send one of your trackers, then.

806
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:16,000
They're using Lady Eboshi.

807
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:19,421
Were there any wolves with the boars?

808
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:22,298
Have you seen Princess Mononoke?

809
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:26,052
It was pitch black when they came at us.

810
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:27,470
She was there.

811
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,099
We were on the front line...

812
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:32,142
And?

813
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:36,479
I don't know. All of a sudden,
the world turned upside down...

814
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:40,066
The scouts put us there to lure the boars in.

815
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:42,235
There were mines underneath us...

816
01:35:42,361 --> 01:35:44,362
and grenades from above.

817
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:39,334
Where's San?

818
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:46,049
Be still, I want to help you.

819
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:53,014
A wolf! There's a wolf
still alive over here.

820
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,099
Sir, what are you...

821
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:00,355
Sir!

822
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,857
What are you doing, boy?

823
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:07,612
He'll take me to Eboshi.

824
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:09,948
So you're with them, are you?

825
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:11,866
Step aside.

826
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:16,287
Would you sacrifice these men and their families?

827
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:18,540
Poison darts!

828
01:37:24,713 --> 01:37:25,713
Stop!

829
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:34,764
Give me a hand!

830
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,234
He's free!

831
01:37:57,955 --> 01:38:00,832
Go through the swamp and hide near the lake.

832
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,294
They have sharpshooters.
Be careful.

833
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:07,338
Take this. My last arrow broke.

834
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:11,301
Go with them.

835
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:12,677
Look after him!

836
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:19,058
Find San. That's where Eboshi is.

837
01:38:30,946 --> 01:38:34,490
Keep up with the scouts.
We finish this today!

838
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:38,119
Jiko!

839
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,538
Well? How does it look?

840
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:45,543
Okkoto's hurt. He and the girl
are going to the Deer God.

841
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:49,547
So they're going to ask him
for help. Stay with them.

842
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:52,592
Keep out of sight or he won't appear.

843
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:54,302
Of course.

844
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:58,348
Was that boar blood on his face?

845
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:02,018
It's a scout trick.
Revolting, isn't it?

846
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:13,112
We're almost at the Deer God's pond.

847
01:39:30,923 --> 01:39:32,173
Something's coming!

848
01:39:35,302 --> 01:39:38,429
Something's wrong, Okkoto!
We have to keep moving.

849
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:40,765
Something bad is coming.

850
01:39:41,016 --> 01:39:43,643
I can't smell it.
There's too much blood.

851
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,066
Apes!

852
01:39:50,192 --> 01:39:51,567
You did this.

853
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,320
Your fault. Forest die.

854
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:58,700
Is this how you thank those who fought for your forest?

855
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,868
You bring monsters.

856
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:03,830
Not animal! Not human!

857
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:06,541
Neither animal nor human?

858
01:40:12,923 --> 01:40:15,425
- They're here!
- Doom! Doom!

859
01:40:34,778 --> 01:40:35,945
Scouts?

860
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:40,950
They're here!

861
01:40:42,244 --> 01:40:47,582
My warriors have returned from the land of the dead.

862
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:56,966
Forward, my warriors!
To the Deer God!

863
01:41:03,515 --> 01:41:06,768
Okkoto, no! Your warriors
haven't come back to life.

864
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:15,276
The boar skins hide their scent.

865
01:41:15,527 --> 01:41:16,611
Humans!

866
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:23,159
Stop! They want us to
lead them to the Deer God!

867
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,624
Come out, Deer God!

868
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:35,797
If you are lord of this forest,
revive my warriors to slay the humans.

869
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,801
Okkoto! Still your heart!

870
01:41:40,469 --> 01:41:43,638
We're surrounded! He's done for.
Leave him!

871
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:46,808
No! He'll become a demon!

872
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:51,145
Tell Mother it's the Deer God the humans want.

873
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,731
She'll know what to do.

874
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:58,361
We can't let our kind die out!

875
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:00,571
Go!

876
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:25,096
I'll kill the first one who moves,
and tell the forest what you are.

877
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:37,483
Ashitaka?

878
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:45,241
Get back!

879
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:56,210
I burn! A flame bursts from within me.

880
01:42:57,462 --> 01:42:58,880
No!

881
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,717
No, Okkoto! Don't turn into a demon!

882
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,053
Okkoto!

883
01:43:09,474 --> 01:43:10,600
An answer!

884
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:15,730
- What is it?
- San's in danger!

885
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:16,772
Let's go!

886
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:46,510
It's hot!

887
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:58,439
No! I don't want
to be a demon!

888
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:00,024
Okkoto!

889
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:13,037
Too slow. Get on.

890
01:44:27,302 --> 01:44:28,427
A wolf!

891
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:32,640
Eboshi...

892
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:40,982
Go on ahead!

893
01:44:42,484 --> 01:44:44,527
Eboshi, listen to me!

894
01:44:44,903 --> 01:44:47,280
- Cease fire!
- Ashitaka?

895
01:44:47,864 --> 01:44:52,785
The ironworks are under attack.
Forget the Deer God and go back!

896
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:54,578
The women need help.

897
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:59,333
Your men are on their way.
They're waiting for you.

898
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:01,836
What proof do you have?

899
01:45:02,045 --> 01:45:05,673
None! I would have stayed
and fought if I could!

900
01:45:06,341 --> 01:45:09,969
You want me to kill samurai instead of the Deer God?

901
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:14,307
No! Can't the forest
and the ironworks live in peace?

902
01:45:16,852 --> 01:45:20,062
- Whose side is he on?
- Let's go back!

903
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:25,568
The women can hold their own.
They have weapons and supplies.

904
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:30,740
There's the pond. He's close!

905
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,702
It's now or never. Stay alert.

906
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:37,163
Do we need her?

907
01:45:37,372 --> 01:45:40,624
We're hunting a god.
Let her do the dirty work.

908
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,195
Moro! Are you dead?

909
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:10,696
San!

910
01:46:10,822 --> 01:46:12,490
Where are you?

911
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:14,658
San!

912
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:23,417
Ashitaka!

913
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:32,009
Okkoto...

914
01:46:40,268 --> 01:46:41,727
Leave, boy.

915
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,147
If we fight, the god won't come.

916
01:46:49,611 --> 01:46:52,446
Okkoto! Be still!

917
01:46:56,451 --> 01:47:00,621
Give me Princess Mononoke.
Where is San?

918
01:47:01,206 --> 01:47:04,500
San, can you hear me?
It's me, Ashitaka!

919
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:11,424
San!

920
01:47:19,182 --> 01:47:20,516
Silence him!

921
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:27,273
Shoot him down!

922
01:47:51,506 --> 01:47:52,006
San!

923
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,014
Ashitaka!

924
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:05,769
San!

925
01:48:06,438 --> 01:48:07,605
Ashitaka!

926
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:21,744
And here I was saving my last strength for that woman.

927
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:23,454
Close up!

928
01:48:41,223 --> 01:48:43,641
Stay away from him.

929
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:45,809
The curse will fall on you.

930
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:57,071
Have you lost even the power of speech?

931
01:48:57,989 --> 01:49:02,409
Well done. Fall back
and tend to the wounded.

932
01:49:03,995 --> 01:49:06,247
A horrible sight.

933
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:16,090
There he is.

934
01:49:28,603 --> 01:49:30,646
Give me back my daughter!

935
01:49:53,128 --> 01:49:54,169
Ashitaka...

936
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:56,880
Can you save San?

937
01:50:06,516 --> 01:50:08,017
The Deer God...

938
01:50:19,154 --> 01:50:20,738
Don't shoot!

939
01:50:34,419 --> 01:50:38,255
Eboshi! Your enemy is not
the Deer God!

940
01:50:39,215 --> 01:50:40,466
Guns can't hurt him...

941
01:50:40,592 --> 01:50:42,134
Only through the head...

942
01:50:52,103 --> 01:50:52,978
San!

943
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,031
Don't die!

944
01:51:31,559 --> 01:51:34,561
They wanted life, but it gave them death.

945
01:51:54,666 --> 01:51:58,460
- It's the Nightwalker!
- Watch closely, all of you.

946
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:00,921
This is how you kill a god.

947
01:52:01,339 --> 01:52:03,924
This is also the god of death.

948
01:52:04,259 --> 01:52:06,135
Stay close behind me.

949
01:52:23,069 --> 01:52:24,278
Stop!

950
01:52:27,657 --> 01:52:28,741
Eboshi!

951
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:43,130
Damn you!

952
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:55,934
Got him! Get the head!

953
01:53:34,974 --> 01:53:37,351
Jiko! Bring the box!

954
01:53:38,353 --> 01:53:41,146
The porters are dead! Quick!

955
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:46,735
Don't touch the body!
It'll suck the life out of you.

956
01:53:50,532 --> 01:53:52,950
Take it! The head is yours.

957
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:02,584
Lady Eboshi!

958
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:05,712
Moro's head... it moved by itself!

959
01:54:05,964 --> 01:54:09,716
Come on, hurry! Run!

960
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:15,764
Run!

961
01:54:32,490 --> 01:54:33,740
To the island!

962
01:54:33,908 --> 01:54:36,618
- I can't swim!
- It's shallow.

963
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:07,149
Bring her here. I'll kill her!

964
01:55:07,358 --> 01:55:10,777
Moro's had her revenge.

965
01:55:11,112 --> 01:55:13,155
- Lady Eboshi!
- Help me.

966
01:55:17,285 --> 01:55:19,620
Don't waste your sympathy.

967
01:55:19,954 --> 01:55:22,414
I promised Toki I'd bring you back.

968
01:55:28,796 --> 01:55:31,256
It's searching for its head.
We can't stay here.

969
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:32,424
San!

970
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:34,217
Help me.

971
01:55:34,344 --> 01:55:36,970
No! You're on their side!

972
01:55:37,138 --> 01:55:39,222
Take her and go away!

973
01:55:42,143 --> 01:55:44,436
Keep away! I hate humans!

974
01:55:45,396 --> 01:55:48,815
I am human. So are you.

975
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:49,691
Shut up!

976
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:51,610
I'm a wolf!

977
01:55:53,196 --> 01:55:54,363
Don't touch me!

978
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:03,580
I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.

979
01:56:10,755 --> 01:56:14,633
Everything is finished.
The forest is dead.

980
01:56:24,268 --> 01:56:28,855
No it's not.
We're still alive. Help me.

981
01:56:54,549 --> 01:56:56,466
Wait! Help us!

982
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:59,553
A little danger and they're useless.

983
01:57:02,765 --> 01:57:04,224
Don't stop!

984
01:57:10,064 --> 01:57:11,398
The head's moving!

985
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:16,611
It's calling him!

986
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:01,031
That will fix it.

987
01:58:01,157 --> 01:58:02,115
Thanks.

988
01:58:02,825 --> 01:58:06,119
- It's too quiet.
- They're waiting for dawn.

989
01:58:07,163 --> 01:58:10,290
I wonder if that young man found Eboshi.

990
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:15,295
I'm sure he did.
She should be here soon.

991
01:58:17,799 --> 01:58:21,760
Look at that face. Hey, Koroku!

992
01:58:21,969 --> 01:58:24,721
Let him sleep for now.

993
01:58:35,024 --> 01:58:37,484
What is it? It sounds unearthly.

994
01:58:50,331 --> 01:58:51,581
The Nightwalker!

995
01:59:05,555 --> 01:59:07,305
Hold your positions!

996
01:59:08,391 --> 01:59:11,309
- It's coming this way.
- We've got to run.

997
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:15,230
We guard the ironworks!
We promised Lady Eboshi.

998
01:59:21,904 --> 01:59:23,905
It's him! Ashitaka!

999
01:59:29,203 --> 01:59:30,287
Everyone, escape!

1000
01:59:30,872 --> 01:59:33,915
The Deer God is coming for his head!

1001
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,668
Touch that muck and you're dead!

1002
01:59:37,044 --> 01:59:39,921
Go to the lake.
The water will protect you.

1003
01:59:40,464 --> 01:59:43,717
Lady Eboshi and the men are coming from the other side.

1004
01:59:44,135 --> 01:59:47,053
We must return the head!

1005
01:59:47,305 --> 01:59:48,180
Hurry!

1006
01:59:48,806 --> 01:59:50,056
It's here.

1007
01:59:50,641 --> 01:59:52,058
What do we do?

1008
01:59:52,226 --> 01:59:53,643
Don't panic.

1009
01:59:53,769 --> 01:59:55,228
To the lake!

1010
01:59:55,521 --> 01:59:58,231
Stay calm! Help the injured.

1011
02:00:07,867 --> 02:00:09,534
Not that way!

1012
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:28,094
There goes the roof...

1013
02:00:33,601 --> 02:00:37,437
Once the forge starts to burn, it's all over.

1014
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:41,733
No, it isn't. We're still alive.
Farther... quickly!

1015
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:01,002
There they are!

1016
02:01:13,391 --> 02:01:14,266
Go!

1017
02:01:15,393 --> 02:01:16,685
Wait!

1018
02:01:17,436 --> 02:01:20,855
You're still alive? That's good.

1019
02:01:21,482 --> 02:01:24,359
I'll return the head.
Leave it and go.

1020
02:01:24,819 --> 02:01:29,155
Give it back now? It's too late.
The sun's coming up.

1021
02:01:29,323 --> 02:01:33,034
Look! A brainless,
life-sucking god of death.

1022
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:34,869
He'll vanish with the sun.

1023
02:01:35,121 --> 02:01:37,122
He's coming, Jiko. Quick!

1024
02:01:37,248 --> 02:01:42,252
The thirst to possess heaven and earth
is what makes us human.

1025
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:44,087
I don't want to kill you.

1026
02:01:45,339 --> 02:01:46,589
Oh, dear.

1027
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,842
Don't look so serious.

1028
02:01:55,683 --> 02:01:56,850
Get going!

1029
02:02:16,537 --> 02:02:17,704
Ashitaka!

1030
02:02:25,713 --> 02:02:26,921
Trapped.

1031
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:30,884
We're surrounded!

1032
02:02:32,136 --> 02:02:34,804
- Sun, come quickly!
- Open it!

1033
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:37,140
Don't you understand? It's too late.

1034
02:02:37,558 --> 02:02:39,726
Ashitaka, talking with humans is useless.

1035
02:02:40,269 --> 02:02:41,978
Human hands must return it.

1036
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:45,732
I warned you.

1037
02:03:00,748 --> 02:03:02,415
O Deer God...

1038
02:03:02,666 --> 02:03:04,417
We return your head!

1039
02:03:04,919 --> 02:03:06,753
Be at peace!

1040
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:19,933
Here it comes!

1041
02:03:50,923 --> 02:03:53,341
- It stopped.
- There they are!

1042
02:04:06,647 --> 02:04:07,897
Lady Eboshi!

1043
02:04:08,232 --> 02:04:10,150
Careful, she's hurt.

1044
02:04:38,345 --> 02:04:40,472
It's falling!

1045
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,480
Hang on tight!

1046
02:05:55,422 --> 02:05:59,342
I didn't know the Deer God made flowers bloom.

1047
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:32,250
San, look!

1048
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:06,117
Even restored, these are not the Deer God's woods.

1049
02:07:06,702 --> 02:07:08,745
The Deer God is dead.

1050
02:07:09,246 --> 02:07:12,582
He can't die.
He is life itself.

1051
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:15,001
He is both life and death.

1052
02:07:15,919 --> 02:07:17,754
He is telling us we should live.

1053
02:07:26,305 --> 02:07:29,891
I love you, Ashitaka.
But I'll never forgive the human race.

1054
02:07:30,309 --> 02:07:34,228
Then live in the forest, and I'll live at the ironworks.

1055
02:07:34,855 --> 02:07:36,230
Together, we'll live.

1056
02:07:36,815 --> 02:07:39,192
Yakul and I will visit you.

1057
02:07:51,205 --> 02:07:55,541
Can you believe it?
Carried to safety by a wolf.

1058
02:07:56,377 --> 02:07:59,671
Someone bring Ashitaka.
I want to thank him.

1059
02:08:00,381 --> 02:08:04,425
We'll start over.
We'll build a good village here.

1060
02:08:05,135 --> 02:08:08,971
I give up.
You can't win against fools.
