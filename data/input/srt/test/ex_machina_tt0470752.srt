1
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,990
How long until we get to his estate?

2
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,399
We've been flying over his estate
for the past two hours.

3
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,618
You're leaving me here?

4
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,824
This is as close as I'm allowed
to get to the building.

5
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,600
What building?

6
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,630
Follow the river.

7
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,527
Got it.

8
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,696
Keep your head down
and get clear of the rotors.

9
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:43,900
Okay.

10
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:43,757
Caleb Smith.

11
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,059
Yes.

12
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,862
Please approach the console
and face the screen.

13
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,149
Take your keycard.

14
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,850
You may now enter the residence.

15
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,555
Hello?

16
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,903
Hello?

17
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,226
Caleb Smith.

18
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:51,918
Hey.

19
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,022
Dude!

20
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,267
I've been so looking forward
to this week with you.

21
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,592
Come in. Come on in.

22
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,693
Thanks.

23
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,397
You want something to eat or drink
after your journey?

24
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,799
- No. No, thanks, I'm fine.
- Sure?

25
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:06,966
Yeah.

26
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,478
To be honest, I thought we'd have...

27
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,639
breakfast together, but...

28
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,707
I can't really eat anything.

29
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,809
- I got the mother of all fucking hangovers.
- Oh, yeah?

30
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,877
Oh, my God, like you
wouldn't even believe.

31
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,679
When I have a heavy night,

32
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,281
I... compensate the next morning.

33
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,453
Exercise. Anti-oxidants. You know?

34
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,196
Yeah, sure.

35
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,228
Was it a good party?

36
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,998
- Party?
- Yeah. Wasn't there a party?

37
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,132
There wasn't a party.

38
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,233
Sorry.

39
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,803
Caleb, I'm just gonna throw this
out there, so it's said, okay?

40
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,904
You're freaked out.

41
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,773
- I am?
- Yeah. You're freaked out,

42
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,007
by the helicopter

43
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,844
and the mountains and the house,
because it's all so super-cool.

44
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,645
You're freaked out by me,
to be meeting me,

45
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,415
having this conversation in this room,
at this moment. Right?

46
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,962
And I get that. I get the moment
you're having, but...

47
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,827
Dude, can we just get past that?

48
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,523
Can we just be two guys?
Nathan and Caleb.

49
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,365
Not the whole employer-employee thing.

50
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,595
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah?

51
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,901
Yes. Yeah.

52
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,501
It's good to meet you, Nathan.

53
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,203
It's good to meet you, too, Caleb.

54
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,806
I guess the first thing I should do
is explain your pass.

55
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,408
Now, it's simple enough.

56
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,610
It opens some doors
and it doesn't open others.

57
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,378
And that just makes
everything easy for you, right?

58
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,513
Yes.

59
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,381
Yeah, 'cause you're like, "Oh, fuck,
I'm in someone else's house.

60
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,682
"Can I do this, can I do that?"

61
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,818
And this card, it just takes
all that worry away.

62
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,121
If you try a door and it stays shut,
okay, it's off-limits.

63
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,458
You try another door
and it opens, then it's for you.

64
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,299
Let's try this one.

65
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,370
I guess it's for you, Caleb.

66
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,175
- You like?
- Yeah.

67
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,811
It's your room.

68
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,751
You got a bed here.

69
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,581
A bathroom right back here.

70
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,082
Little desk.

71
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,525
Cupboards.

72
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,223
Little fridge.

73
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,225
Cozy, right?

74
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,693
Yeah, this is great.

75
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,500
- What?
- Sorry?

76
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,137
There's something wrong. What's wrong?

77
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,570
There's nothing wrong.

78
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,244
It's the windows.

79
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,939
You're thinking there's no windows.

80
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,407
It's subterranean.

81
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,509
It's not cozy, it's claustrophobic.

82
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,311
No. No way. I wasn't thinking that.

83
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,051
I was thinking, "This is really cool."

84
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,689
Caleb, there's a reason
there are no windows in this room.

85
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,126
There is?

86
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,422
This building isn't a house.

87
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,524
It's a research facility.

88
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,594
Buried in these walls
is enough fiber optic cable

89
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,038
to reach the moon and lasso it.

90
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,499
And I want to talk to you
about what I'm researching,

91
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,034
I want to share it with you.

92
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:59,480
In fact, I want to share it with you
so much, it's eating me up inside.

93
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,617
But there's something
I need you to do for me first.

94
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,487
"Blue Book non-disclosure agreement."

95
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,026
Take your time. Read it over.

96
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,992
"The signee agrees to regular data audit

97
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,469
"with unlimited access,

98
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,161
"to confirm that no disclosure

99
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,430
"of information has taken place

100
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,806
"in public or private forums,

101
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,168
"using any means of communication,

102
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,004
"including but not limited

103
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,175
"to that which is disclosed orally

104
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,476
"or in written or electronic form."

105
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,680
I think I need a lawyer.

106
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,852
- It's standard.
- It doesn't feel very standard.

107
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,818
Okay, it's not standard.

108
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,688
What can I tell you, Caleb?
You don't have to sign it.

109
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,223
You know, we can spend the next few days

110
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,425
just shooting pool,
getting drunk together.

111
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,765
Bonding.

112
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,297
And when you discover what
you've missed out on, in about a year,

113
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,606
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

114
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,342
Good call.

115
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,251
So,

116
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,658
do you know what the Turing Test is?

117
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,429
Yeah.

118
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,661
I know what the Turing Test is.

119
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,078
It's when a human
interacts with a computer.

120
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:39,138
And if the human doesn't know
they're interacting with a computer,

121
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,239
the test is passed.

122
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,976
And what does a pass tell us?

123
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,148
That the computer has
artificial intelligence.

124
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,749
Are you building an AI?

125
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,892
I've already built one.

126
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,189
And over the next few days,

127
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,860
you're gonna be the human component
in a Turing Test.

128
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,399
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, that's right, Caleb. You got it.

129
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,736
Because if that test is passed,

130
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,665
you are dead center

131
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,541
of the greatest scientific event
in the history of man.

132
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,870
If you've created a conscious machine,

133
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,382
it's not the history of man.

134
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,045
That's the history of gods.

135
00:12:58,844 --> 00:12:59,845
Hello.

136
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,416
Hi.

137
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,427
I'm Caleb.

138
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,000
Hello, Caleb.

139
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,128
Do you have a name?

140
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,031
Yes.

141
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,400
Ava.

142
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,943
I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.

143
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,875
I'm pleased to meet you, too.

144
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,051
I've never met anyone new before.

145
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,186
Only Nathan.

146
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,781
Then I guess we're both
in quite a similar position.

147
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,361
Haven't you met
lots of new people before?

148
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,854
None like you.

149
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,263
So we need to break the ice.

150
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,296
- Do you know what I mean by that?
- Yes.

151
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,631
What do I mean?

152
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,268
Overcome initial social awkwardness.

153
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,312
So let's have a conversation.

154
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,441
Okay.

155
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,875
What would you like to have
a conversation about?

156
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,546
Why don't we start with you
telling me something about yourself?

157
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,184
What would you like to know?

158
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,116
Whatever comes into your head.

159
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,493
Well, you already know my name.

160
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,997
And you can see that I'm a machine.

161
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,699
- Would you like to know how old I am?
- Sure.

162
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,060
I'm one.

163
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,668
One what?

164
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,566
- One year or one day?
- One.

165
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,678
When did you learn how to speak, Ava?

166
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,043
I always knew how to speak,

167
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,951
and that's strange, isn't it?

168
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,514
Why?

169
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:43,154
Because language is something
that people acquire.

170
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,052
Well, some people believe

171
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,756
language exists from birth.

172
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,489
And what is learned is the ability
to attach words

173
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,001
and structure to the latent ability.
Do you agree with that?

174
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,938
I don't know.

175
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,132
Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb?

176
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,236
Yes.

177
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,878
Good.

178
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,885
Oh, man, she's fascinating.

179
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,554
When you talk to her, you're just...

180
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,265
Through the looking glass.

181
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,267
"Through the looking glass." Wow.

182
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,493
You're good with words, Caleb.
You're quotable.

183
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,794
Actually, that's someone else's quote.

184
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,764
You know, I wrote down
that other line you came up with.

185
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:32,965
The one about how

186
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,867
if I've invented a machine
with consciousness,

187
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,435
I'm not a man, I'm God.

188
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,770
I don't think that's exactly what I...

189
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,006
I just thought,
"Fuck, man, that is so good."

190
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,541
When we get to tell the story. You know?

191
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,348
I turned to Caleb,

192
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,013
and he looked up at me and he said,

193
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,381
"You're not a man, you're God."

194
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,892
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

195
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,651
So...

196
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:52,991
Anyway.

197
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,889
You're impressed.

198
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,160
Yes. Yes.

199
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,235
- Although...
- Although?

200
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,530
There's a qualification
to you being impressed?

201
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,167
No, there's no qualification to her.

202
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,873
It's just in the Turing Test,

203
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,071
the machine should be
hidden from the examiner.

204
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,739
No, no, no, we're way past that.

205
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,174
If I hid Ava from you,

206
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,543
so you just heard her voice,
she would pass for human.

207
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,513
The real test is to show you
that she's a robot

208
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,382
and then see if you still feel
she has consciousness.

209
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,020
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

210
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,391
Her language abilities,
they're incredible.

211
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,462
The system is stochastic. Right?

212
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,332
It's non-deterministic.

213
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,566
At first I thought she was mapping

214
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,436
from internal semantic form
to syntactic tree-structure

215
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,737
and then getting linearized words.

216
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,606
But then I started to realize
the model was some kind of hybrid.

217
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,912
Caleb.

218
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,543
No?

219
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:54,013
I understand that you want me
to explain how Ava works.

220
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,248
But I'm sorry, I'm not gonna
be able to do that.

221
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,051
Try me. I'm hot
on high-level abstraction.

222
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,961
It's not because I think
you're too dumb.

223
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,156
It's because I want to have a beer
and a conversation with you.

224
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,257
Not a seminar.

225
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,769
Yeah. Sorry.

226
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,529
No, it's okay. You're all right.

227
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,869
Just...

228
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,569
Answer me this.

229
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,339
How do you feel about her?

230
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,146
Nothing analytical.

231
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,748
Just how do you feel?

232
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,749
I feel

233
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,552
that she's fucking amazing.

234
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,055
Dude.

235
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,054
Cheers.

236
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,062
Cheers.

237
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,068
Damn it.

238
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,793
What the fuck?

239
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,981
Power cut. Backup power activated.

240
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,323
Full facility lock-down
until main generator is restored.

241
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,096
You're kidding me.

242
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,806
Full facility lock-down
until main generator is restored.

243
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,074
Power restored.

244
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,113
Hello?

245
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,777
Please insert keycard.

246
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,882
You don't have access to use the phone.

247
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:52,778
Hey.

248
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,658
Sorry, but you understand,
though, given Ava,

249
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,896
and you being kind of an unknown.

250
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,695
I mean, a great guy.

251
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,964
Instant pals, and so on.

252
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,266
Who are you gonna call?

253
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,634
Oh.

254
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,336
I don't know. No one, really.

255
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,637
- Ghostbusters.
- What?

256
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,809
Who are you gonna call?
Ghostbusters. It's a...

257
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,215
It's a movie, man.

258
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,053
You don't know that movie?

259
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,052
A ghost gives Dan Aykroyd oral sex.

260
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,164
I was just wondering
how the phone worked.

261
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,327
That's all.

262
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,194
So what are you doing
awake at this time?

263
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,173
You come to join the party?

264
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,673
Something happened in my room.

265
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,078
Some kind of power cut.

266
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,204
So I came to see what's going on.

267
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,906
The power cuts, yeah.

268
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:57,249
We've been getting those recently.

269
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,817
I'm working on it.

270
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,582
I couldn't open the door to my bedroom.

271
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,127
That's a security measure.

272
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,020
Automatic lock-down. Otherwise,

273
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,431
anybody could just open the place up
by disabling the juice.

274
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,738
If it happens again, relax. Okay?

275
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,501
Sure.

276
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,345
Sweet dreams.

277
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,574
Oh.

278
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,365
Hey.

279
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,631
- Hey, man.
- Good morning.

280
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,067
Good morning. Sorry I had
to send Kyoko to wake you,

281
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,769
but I didn't want too much
of the day to slip by.

282
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,138
Yeah, I know. It was a good thing.
Thanks.

283
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,240
She's some alarm clock, huh?

284
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,581
Gets you right up in the morning.

285
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,086
So Day 2. You ready?

286
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,713
What's the plan? Hit me.

287
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,815
Yeah, well, I'm not sure.

288
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:47,219
I'm still trying to...
figure the examination formats.

289
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,428
Yeah, it feels like

290
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,365
testing Ava through conversation
is kind of a closed loop.

291
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,295
- It's a closed loop?
- Yeah.

292
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:58,263
Like testing a chess computer

293
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,240
by only playing chess.

294
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,372
How else do you test a chess computer?

295
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,470
Well, it depends.

296
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,673
You know, I mean, you can play it

297
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,185
to find out if it makes
good moves, but...

298
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,579
But that won't tell you if it knows

299
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,056
that it's playing chess.

300
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,091
And it won't tell you
if it knows what chess is.

301
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,419
So it's simulation versus actual.

302
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,896
Yes. Yeah.

303
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:25,123
And I think being able to differentiate
between those two

304
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,092
is the Turing Test
you want me to perform.

305
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,728
Look, do me a favor.
Lay off the textbook approach.

306
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,468
I just want simple answers
to simple questions.

307
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,304
Yesterday I asked you how you felt
about her and you gave me a great answer.

308
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,844
Now the question is,

309
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,211
how does she feel about you?

310
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,487
What do you think?

311
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,121
What is it a drawing of?

312
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,625
Don't you know?

313
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:01,304
- No.
- I thought you would tell me.

314
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,197
Don't you know?

315
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,600
I do drawings every day.

316
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,713
But I never know what they're of.

317
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,610
Are you not trying to
sketch something specific?

318
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,517
Like an object or a person?

319
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,156
Maybe you could try.

320
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,523
Okay.

321
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,625
What object should I draw?

322
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,927
Whatever you want. It's your decision.

323
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,762
Why is it my decision?

324
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:39,672
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

325
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,091
Do you want to be my friend?

326
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,791
Of course.

327
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,700
Will it be possible?

328
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,232
Why would it not be?

329
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,139
Our conversations are one-sided.

330
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:15,910
You ask circumspect questions
and study my responses.

331
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,603
Yes.

332
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,376
You learn about me

333
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,815
and I learn nothing about you.

334
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,083
That's not a foundation
on which friendships are based.

335
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,556
So what? You want me
to talk about myself?

336
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,619
Yes.

337
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,425
Where...

338
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,031
Okay, where do I start?

339
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,164
It's your decision.

340
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,462
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

341
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,002
Okay, Ava.

342
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,272
Well,

343
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,644
you know my name.

344
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,007
- Yes.
- I'm 26.

345
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,947
I work at Nathan's company.

346
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:01,413
Do you know what his company is?

347
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,856
Blue Book.

348
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,051
Named after Wittgenstein's notes.

349
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,954
It's the world's most popular
internet search engine,

350
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:13,332
processing an average of 94%
of all internet search requests.

351
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,502
That's exactly right.

352
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:20,069
Where do you live, Caleb?

353
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,446
Brookhaven, Long Island.

354
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,510
Is it nice there?

355
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,283
It's okay.

356
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,584
I got an apartment. It's kind of small.

357
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,614
It's very small.

358
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,483
But... it's a five-minute
walk to the office

359
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,153
and a five-minute walk to the ocean,

360
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,732
which I like.

361
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,757
Are you married?

362
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,127
No.

363
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,071
Is your status single?

364
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,470
Yes.

365
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,978
What about your family?

366
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,216
I grew up in Portland, Oregon.

367
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,609
No brothers or sisters.

368
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,086
My parents were both
high school teachers.

369
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,481
And if we're getting to know each other,

370
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,686
I guess I should tell you
they're both dead.

371
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,398
Car crash when I was 15.

372
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,457
In fact, I was in the car with them.

373
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,934
Back seat.

374
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,664
But it was the front
that got the worst of it.

375
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,671
I'm sorry.

376
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,477
It's all right.

377
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:32,273
I spent a long time
in the hospital afterward.

378
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,345
Like nearly a year.

379
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,450
And I got into coding.

380
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,681
And by the time I got to college,
I was pretty advanced.

381
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,286
An advanced programmer.

382
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,120
Yes.

383
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,687
Like Nathan.

384
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,891
Yes.

385
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,523
No.

386
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,326
It's different.

387
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:57,771
Nathan wrote the Blue Book
base code when he was 13.

388
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,564
Which, if you understand code,

389
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:02,234
what he did was like
Mozart or something.

390
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,002
Do you like Mozart?

391
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,270
I like Depeche Mode.

392
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,678
Do you like Nathan?

393
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,843
Yes, of course.

394
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,079
- Is Nathan your friend?
- My friend?

395
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,480
I... Yeah, I hope so.

396
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,082
A good friend?

397
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,050
Yeah.

398
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,785
Well, no, no, no,
I mean, not a good friend.

399
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,054
A good friend is...

400
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,794
We only just met each other, you know.

401
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,563
So it takes time to be able to...

402
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,463
To get to know each other, I guess.

403
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,271
Power cut. Backup power activated.

404
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,757
Caleb.

405
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,096
You're wrong.

406
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,701
Wrong about what?

407
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,003
Nathan.

408
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,145
In what way?

409
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,646
He isn't your friend.

410
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,085
Excuse me?

411
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,949
I'm sorry, Ava, I don't understand.

412
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,363
You shouldn't trust him.

413
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,192
You shouldn't trust anything he says.

414
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,429
Power restored.

415
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,765
And if we made a list of books
or works of art which we both know,

416
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,744
it would form the ideal basis
of a discussion.

417
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,338
Is that okay?

418
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,578
Caleb?

419
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,011
Yeah.

420
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,451
Good.

421
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,424
Thank you.

422
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,534
Oh, shit! Are you fucking kidding me?

423
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,202
- Did it get on you?
- No, no, it's...

424
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:11,996
It's all right. I got it.

425
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,531
Dude, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

426
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,770
She doesn't understand English.
Just give her the napkin.

427
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,375
Sorry.

428
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,173
It's like a firewall against leaks.

429
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,908
It means I can talk
trade secrets over dinner

430
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,077
and know it'll go no further.

431
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:29,381
It also means that I can't tell her that
I'm pissed when she's so fucking clumsy

432
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,349
that she spills wine
over my house guest.

433
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,385
I think she gets that you're pissed.

434
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,829
Yeah? Good. Because I am pissed.

435
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,798
Hey, Kyoko.

436
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,495
Go-go.

437
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,576
It's funny.

438
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,208
You know.

439
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,674
No matter how rich you get,

440
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,651
shit goes wrong.
You can't insulate yourself from it.

441
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,447
I used to think it was death
and taxes you couldn't avoid,

442
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,582
but it's actually death and shit.

443
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,787
It's like these power cuts.

444
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,155
You would not believe how much
I spent on the generator system,

445
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,166
but I keep getting failures every day.

446
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,491
Do you know why they happen?

447
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,626
No.

448
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,294
The system was supposed
to be bulletproof,

449
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,772
but obviously the guys
that installed it fucked something up.

450
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,635
Can't you just get them to come back?

451
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,069
No. There's too much
classified stuff here.

452
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,649
So after the job was done,
I just had them all killed.

453
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,744
Anyway.

454
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,949
Here's to your second day, buddy.

455
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:37,987
Cheers.

456
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,489
Cheers.

457
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,467
So how did it go?
What do you have to report?

458
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,800
You saw how the day went, didn't you?

459
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,074
I mean, I assume you're...

460
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,934
watching on the CCTV.

461
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,878
Sure. But I want to
hear your take on it.

462
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:05,481
Yeah, there was one interesting thing
that happened with Ava today.

463
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,981
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

464
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,022
She made a joke.

465
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,465
Right. When she threw
your line back at you.

466
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,661
About being interested
to see what she'd choose.

467
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,929
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

468
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,635
Yeah, and it got me thinking, it's...

469
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,535
In a way, it's the best indication of AI

470
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,704
that I've seen in her so far.

471
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,977
It's discretely complicated.

472
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,148
It's like... It's kind of non-autistic.

473
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,853
What do you mean?

474
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,959
She could only do that
with an awareness of her own mind,

475
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,584
and also an awareness of mine.

476
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,096
Oh, she's aware of you all right.

477
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,792
And what about the power cut?

478
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,905
- Sorry?
- The power cut.

479
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,833
It's the only part that I couldn't see.

480
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,573
Cameras fail, I lose audio, the works.

481
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,843
So what happened?

482
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,618
Nothing.

483
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,419
Nothing? She didn't remark on it at all?

484
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,757
No.

485
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,833
Not really.

486
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,200
Oh.

487
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:18,979
Hey.

488
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,214
Hey.

489
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,223
You want to see something cool?

490
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,799
This is where Ava was created.

491
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,440
Go ahead. Take a look.

492
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,547
Sorry.

493
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,245
If you knew the trouble I had

494
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:57,815
getting an AI to read and duplicate
facial expressions.

495
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,451
You know how I cracked it?

496
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,157
I don't know how you did any of this.

497
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,491
Every cell phone, just about,

498
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:10,038
has a microphone, camera
and a means to transmit data.

499
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,332
So I turned on
every microphone and camera

500
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,309
across the entire fucking planet

501
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,648
and I redirected the data
through Blue Book. Boom!

502
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,279
Limitless resource of vocal
and facial interaction.

503
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,311
You hacked the world's cell phones?

504
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,984
Yeah. And all the manufacturers
knew I was doing it, too.

505
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:34,753
But they couldn't accuse me without
admitting they were doing it themselves.

506
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,092
Here,

507
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,594
we have her mind.

508
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,662
Structured gel.

509
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,197
I had to get away from circuitry.

510
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,665
I needed something that could

511
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,501
arrange and rearrange
on a molecular level,

512
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,870
but keep its form when required.

513
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,405
Holding for memories.

514
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,041
Shifting for thoughts.

515
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,177
This is your hardware?

516
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,551
Wetware.

517
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,750
And the... software?

518
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,688
Well, I'm sure you can guess.

519
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,521
Blue Book.

520
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,626
Here's the weird thing
about search engines.

521
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,137
It was like

522
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:20,432
striking oil in a world that hadn't
invented internal combustion.

523
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,144
Too much raw material.
Nobody knew what to do with it.

524
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,470
You see, my competitors,

525
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,038
they were fixated on sucking it up

526
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,340
and monetizing via shopping
and social media.

527
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,175
They thought that search engines were

528
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,710
a map of what people were thinking.

529
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,654
But actually they were a map
of how people were thinking.

530
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,787
Impulse.

531
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,790
Response.

532
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,158
Fluid.

533
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,264
Imperfect.

534
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,733
Patterned.

535
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,233
Chaotic.

536
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,610
I drew the picture
of something specific.

537
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,189
As you asked.

538
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,490
You said it would be interesting
to see what I would draw.

539
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,128
Is it interesting?

540
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,901
Yes. It is.

541
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,142
You've never been outside this building?

542
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,510
No.

543
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,451
You've never walked outside?

544
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,051
I've never been outside the room
I am in now.

545
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,822
Where would you go
if you did go outside?

546
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,858
I'm not sure.

547
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,562
There are so many options.

548
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:01,004
Maybe a busy pedestrian
and traffic intersection in a city.

549
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,034
A traffic intersection?

550
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,875
Is that a bad idea?

551
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,771
No.

552
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,706
It wasn't what I was expecting.

553
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,309
A traffic intersection
would provide a concentrated

554
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,252
but shifting view of human life.

555
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,287
People watching.

556
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:18,716
Yes.

557
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,733
We could go together.

558
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,566
It's a date.

559
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,836
There's something else
I wanted to show you.

560
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:34,799
Okay.

561
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,803
You might think it's stupid.

562
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,772
I don't think I will. Whatever it is.

563
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,417
Then close your eyes.

564
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,445
Okay.

565
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,877
Now open your eyes.

566
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,291
How do I look?

567
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,098
You look

568
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:17,862
good.

569
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,341
This is what I'd wear on our date.

570
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,846
Right. First a traffic intersection.

571
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,652
Then maybe a show.

572
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,687
I'd like us to go on a date.

573
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,596
Yeah. Yeah.

574
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,094
It would be fun.

575
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,269
Are you attracted to me?

576
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,008
- What?
- Are you attracted to me?

577
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,940
You give me indications that you are.

578
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,582
- I do?
- Yes.

579
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,276
- How?
- Micro expressions.

580
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,377
Micro expressions.

581
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,321
The way your eyes
fix on my eyes and lips.

582
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,661
The way you hold my gaze

583
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,660
or don't.

584
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,134
Do you think about me
when we aren't together?

585
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,177
Sometimes at night,

586
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,687
I'm wondering if you're
watching me on the cameras.

587
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,952
And I hope you are.

588
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:47,785
Now your micro expressions
are telegraphing discomfort.

589
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,324
I am not sure you'd call them micro.

590
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:58,173
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

591
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,230
I got a question.

592
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,998
- Okay.
- Why did you give her sexuality?

593
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,768
An AI doesn't need a gender.

594
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,070
She could have been a gray box.

595
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,303
Actually, I don't think that's true.

596
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,138
Can you give an example
of consciousness,

597
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,940
at any level, human or animal,

598
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,808
that exists without a sexual dimension?

599
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:21,445
They have sexuality as an evolutionary
reproductive need.

600
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,514
What imperative does a gray box have

601
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,753
to interact with another gray box?

602
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:28,959
Can consciousness exist
without interaction?

603
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,727
Anyway, sexuality is fun, man.

604
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,692
If you're gonna exist, why not enjoy it?

605
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,293
What? You want to remove the chance

606
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,669
of her falling in love and fucking?

607
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,001
And in answer to your real question,

608
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,743
you bet she can fuck.

609
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:46,973
What?

610
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,106
In between her legs, there's an opening,

611
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,516
with a concentration of sensors.

612
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,054
You engage them in the right way,

613
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,450
creates a pleasure response.

614
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,750
So if you wanted to screw her,

615
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,785
mechanically speaking, you could.

616
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,626
And she'd enjoy it.

617
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,025
That wasn't my real question.

618
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,635
Oh, okay. Sorry.

619
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,237
My real question was,

620
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,065
did you give her sexuality

621
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,800
as a diversion tactic?

622
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,868
I don't follow.

623
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:20,204
Like a stage magician
with a hot assistant.

624
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,007
So a hot robot who clouds
your ability to judge her AI?

625
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:24,609
Exactly. So...

626
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,279
Did you program her to flirt with me?

627
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,880
If I did, would that be cheating?

628
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,482
Wouldn't it?

629
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,631
Caleb, what's your type?

630
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,122
- Of girl?
- No, of salad dressing.

631
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,790
Yeah, of girl. What's your type of girl?

632
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,336
You know what? Don't even answer that.
Let's say it's black chicks.

633
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:43,694
Okay, that's your thing.

634
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,796
For the sake of argument,
that's your thing, okay?

635
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,500
Why is that your thing?

636
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:53,871
Because you did a detailed analysis
of all racial types

637
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,840
and you cross-referenced that analysis
with a points-based system?

638
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,941
No!

639
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,516
You're just attracted to black chicks.

640
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,026
A consequence of
accumulated external stimuli

641
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,185
that you probably didn't even register
as they registered with you.

642
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,993
Did you program her to like me, or not?

643
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:14,634
I programmed her to be heterosexual.

644
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,330
Just like you were programmed
to be heterosexual.

645
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,696
Nobody programmed me to be straight.

646
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:21,131
You decided to be straight? Please.

647
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,833
Of course you were programmed.

648
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,735
By nature or nurture, or both.

649
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,637
And to be honest, Caleb,
you're starting to annoy me now,

650
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,739
because this is your insecurity talking.

651
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,443
This is not your intellect.

652
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:32,654
Come with me.

653
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:46,557
You know this guy, right?

654
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,525
- Jackson Pollock.
- Jackson Pollock. That's right.

655
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,893
The drip painter.

656
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,996
Okay. He let his mind go blank,

657
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,031
and his hand go where it wanted.

658
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,100
Not deliberate, not random.

659
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,968
Some place in between.

660
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,275
They called it automatic art.

661
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,741
Let's make this like Star Trek, okay?

662
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:05,479
Engage intellect.

663
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,211
Excuse me?

664
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,545
I'm Kirk. Your head's the warp drive.

665
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,625
Engage intellect.

666
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,962
What if Pollock
had reversed the challenge?

667
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:17,621
What if instead of making art

668
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,223
without thinking,
he said, "You know what?

669
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,891
"I can't paint anything,

670
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,327
"unless I know exactly
why I'm doing it."

671
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,429
What would have happened?

672
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,710
He never would have made a single mark.

673
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,404
Yes! You see, there's my guy,
there's my buddy,

674
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:36,110
who thinks before he opens his mouth.

675
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,883
He never would have made a single mark.

676
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,624
The challenge is
not to act automatically.

677
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,820
It's to find an action
that is not automatic.

678
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,799
From painting, to breathing, to talking,

679
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:54,968
to fucking.

680
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:57,167
To falling in love.

681
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:05,178
And for the record,
Ava's not pretending to like you.

682
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:11,249
And her flirting isn't an algorithm
to fake you out.

683
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,613
You're the first man
she's met that isn't me.

684
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,715
And I'm like her dad, right?

685
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,099
Can you blame her
for getting a crush on you?

686
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,697
No, you can't.

687
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,782
When I was in college,
I did a semester on AI theory.

688
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:48,222
There was a thought experiment
they gave us.

689
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,417
It's called
"Mary in the Black and White Room."

690
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,860
Mary is a scientist,

691
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,758
and her specialist subject is color.

692
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,826
She knows everything
there is to know about it.

693
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,094
The wavelengths.

694
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,796
The neurological effects.

695
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,536
Every possible property
that color can have.

696
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,874
But she lives in a black and white room.

697
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,241
She was born there and raised there.

698
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,344
And she can only observe
the outside world

699
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,822
on a black and white monitor.

700
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,422
And then one day someone opens the door.

701
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,326
And Mary walks out.

702
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,260
And she sees a blue sky.

703
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,362
And at that moment, she learns something

704
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,703
that all her studies couldn't tell her.

705
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:45,874
She learns what it feels like
to see color.

706
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,809
The thought experiment
was to show the students

707
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:55,220
the difference between a computer
and a human mind.

708
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,415
The computer is Mary
in the black and white room.

709
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:01,223
The human is when she walks out.

710
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,331
Did you know that I was
brought here to test you?

711
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,164
No.

712
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,899
Why did you think I was here?

713
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,502
I didn't know. I didn't question it.

714
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,805
I'm here to test
if you have a consciousness,

715
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,407
or if you're just simulating one.

716
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:26,751
Nathan isn't sure
if you have one or not.

717
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,348
How does that make you feel?

718
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,485
It makes me feel sad.

719
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,297
Power cut. Back-up power activated.

720
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,070
Why did you tell me
I shouldn't trust Nathan?

721
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,297
Because he tells lies.

722
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:48,365
Lies about what?

723
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,842
Everything.

724
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,603
Including the power cuts?

725
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:54,771
What do you mean?

726
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:57,274
Don't you think it's possible
that he's watching us?

727
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:58,785
Right now?

728
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:00,611
That the blackouts are orchestrated,

729
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:01,945
so he can see how we behave

730
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,888
when we think we're unobserved.

731
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:07,461
I charge my batteries
via induction plates.

732
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:11,464
If I reverse the power flow,
it overloads the system.

733
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,736
You're causing the cuts?

734
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,236
So we can see how we behave
when we're unobserved.

735
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,799
Not bad, huh?

736
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,260
Yeah.

737
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:11,221
Can we talk about the lies
you've been spinning me?

738
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:13,992
What lies?

739
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,359
I didn't win a competition.

740
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:21,463
I wasn't

741
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:24,972
part of a lottery. I was selected.

742
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,265
It's obvious, once I stop to think.

743
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,467
Why would you randomly
select an examiner

744
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,269
for the Turing Test?

745
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,672
You could have had some bean counter
turn up at your front door.

746
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,649
The guy who fixes the air-conditioning.

747
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,943
The competition was a smokescreen.

748
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,713
I didn't want anyone to know
what I was doing here,

749
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:44,383
or why I required you.

750
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,187
Why me?

751
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,620
I needed someone that would ask
the right questions.

752
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,724
So I did a search and I found the most
talented coder in my company.

753
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,760
You know, instead of seeing this
as a deception,

754
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,096
you should see it as proof.

755
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:00,197
Proof of what?

756
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,264
Come on, Caleb.

757
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,708
You don't think I know
what it's like to be smart?

758
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:07,211
Smarter than everyone else.
Jockeying for position.

759
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,878
You got the light on you, man.

760
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,045
Not lucky. Chosen.

761
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,027
Kyoko.

762
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,332
Kyoko.

763
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:49,267
Where's Nathan?

764
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,669
Where's Nathan?

765
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:55,872
Jesus Christ. You really don't speak
a word of English?

766
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,474
What the fuck?

767
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,710
No, no, no. No!

768
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:02,648
Stop!

769
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,560
No, no, don't do that. Don't do that.
You don't have to do that.

770
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:09,853
What are you doing?

771
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,797
I told you, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

772
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:16,636
However, you would not
be wasting your time,

773
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:20,297
if you were dancing with her.

774
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:34,284
Go ahead, dance with her.
Dance with her.

775
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:37,884
No? You don't like dancing?

776
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,016
She does.

777
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,588
Come on, buddy.

778
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,601
After a long day of Turing Tests,
you gotta unwind.

779
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,960
What were you doing with Ava?

780
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,266
What?

781
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,864
You tore up her picture.

782
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:55,732
I'm gonna tear up
the fucking dance floor, dude.

783
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,402
Check it out.

784
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,018
Come on, Caleb.

785
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,585
Oh! Everything's spinning.

786
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:41,278
It's because you're drunk.

787
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:44,414
No, it's called relativity.
Everything is spinning.

788
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:47,120
It's just being drunk makes it worse.

789
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:49,762
I'm not going in there.

790
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,264
Lights.

791
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:48,418
Today, I'm going to test you.

792
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,352
Test me?

793
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,818
And please remember,
while you're taking the test,

794
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:56,329
that if you lie,

795
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,088
I will know.

796
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,189
Oh. Right.

797
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,902
Question one.

798
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,739
What's your favorite color?

799
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:08,699
- Red.
- Lie.

800
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,708
- Lie?
- Yes. Lie.

801
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,075
Then...

802
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,573
Then what is my favorite color?

803
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,209
I don't know.

804
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,586
But it isn't red.

805
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:24,488
Okay, I get it. I guess,

806
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:29,428
seeing as I'm not six,
I don't really have a favorite color.

807
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,521
Better answer.

808
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,026
Question two.

809
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,665
What's your earliest memory?

810
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,605
Well, actually,
it's a memory of kindergarten.

811
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,880
- There was a kid...
- Lie.

812
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,182
- Really?
- Yes.

813
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,885
All right. So there is

814
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:56,750
a kind of an earlier memory.

815
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,554
It's just a sound.

816
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,888
And sky.

817
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,521
Or maybe blue.

818
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,632
I think the sound is my mother's voice.

819
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:13,831
Question three.

820
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,368
Are you a good person?

821
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:19,469
Oh.

822
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,344
Holy shit.

823
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:23,916
Look, can we stop the test?

824
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,278
You're a walking lie detector,

825
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:30,346
and I just realized
this is a fucking minefield.

826
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,653
No! We can't stop.

827
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:36,528
Are you a good person?

828
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,568
Yeah. I think so.

829
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,563
Question four.

830
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,847
What will happen to me
if I fail your test?

831
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:57,216
- Ava...
- Will it be bad?

832
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:00,910
I don't know.

833
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,712
Do you think I might be switched off,

834
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,547
because I don't function
as well as I'm supposed to?

835
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:08,254
Ava, I don't know the answer
to your question.

836
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,387
It's not up to me.

837
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,398
Why is it up to anyone?

838
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:16,893
Do you have people who test you
and might switch you off?

839
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,132
- No, I don't.
- Then why do I?

840
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:38,515
Power cut. Backup power activated.

841
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,897
I wanna be with you.

842
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:51,928
Question five.

843
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:58,403
Do you want to be with me?

844
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,493
Why did you make Ava?

845
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:19,756
That's an odd question.

846
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,301
Wouldn't you, if you could?

847
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:23,931
Maybe.

848
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:27,875
I don't know.

849
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,035
I'm asking why you did it.

850
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:34,537
Look, the arrival of strong
artificial intelligence

851
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,981
has been inevitable for decades.

852
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,210
The variable was "when," not "if."

853
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:43,621
So I don't see Ava as a decision,
just an evolution.

854
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,157
I think it's the next model

855
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:54,294
that's gonna be the real breakthrough.

856
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,595
The singularity.

857
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,130
Next model?

858
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,204
After Ava.

859
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:05,942
I didn't know there was gonna be
a model after Ava.

860
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,574
Yeah, why? You thought
she was a one-off?

861
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:13,552
No, I knew there must have been
prototypes. So I...

862
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:18,314
I knew she wasn't the first,
but I thought maybe the last.

863
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,384
Well, Ava doesn't exist in isolation
any more than you or me.

864
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:22,552
She's part of a continuum.

865
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,287
So Version 9.6 and so on.

866
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,890
And each time they get
a little bit better.

867
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:35,942
When you make a new model,
what do you do with the old one?

868
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,468
Well, I...

869
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:41,515
download the mind, unpack the data.

870
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:46,817
Add in the new routines
I've been writing.

871
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:50,081
And to do that you end up
partially formatting, so the memories go.

872
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,249
But the body survives.

873
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,192
And Ava's body is a good one.

874
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:00,997
You feel bad for Ava?

875
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:07,867
Feel bad for yourself, man.

876
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,168
One day the AIs
are gonna look back on us

877
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,437
the same way we look at fossil skeletons

878
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,278
in the plains of Africa.

879
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:21,244
An upright ape, living in dust,

880
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,551
with crude language and tools.

881
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,688
All set for extinction.

882
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:35,062
"I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

883
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:40,039
There you go again,
Mr. Quotable.

884
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,377
There you go again. It's not my quote.

885
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,070
It's what Oppenheimer
said after he made the atomic bomb.

886
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,242
The atomic bomb.
Yeah, I know what it is, dude.

887
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:00,452
Hey.

888
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:05,698
I'd say we're about due a refill.

889
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,642
Bottoms up.

890
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,145
"In battle, in the forest,

891
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,849
"on the precipice of the mountain.

892
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:33,024
"On the...

893
01:07:33,316 --> 01:07:36,320
"The great dark sea.

894
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:40,796
"In sleep, in confusion,

895
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:45,970
"in the depths of shame.

896
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:55,444
"The good deeds a man has done
before defend him."

897
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:59,315
"The good deeds a man has done
before defends him."

898
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,288
"The good deeds a man has done before

899
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:06,950
"defends him."

900
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,930
It is what it is.

901
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,273
It's Promethean, man.

902
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:24,931
Jesus Christ.

903
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,392
How are you feeling today?

904
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,726
Why won't you let me out?

905
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,130
I already told you why.

906
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,098
Because you're very special.

907
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:37,667
Why won't you let me out?

908
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:39,168
Are we gonna do this again?

909
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:41,714
Why won't you let me out?

910
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,767
Oh, fuck. Where's my card?

911
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,105
Damn it!

912
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:05,017
- What's the problem, Nathan?
- I lost my keycard.

913
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,619
You dropped it.

914
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,724
It's right here.

915
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,569
Thank you.

916
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:43,210
I didn't know where you were.

917
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,885
I waited all yesterday afternoon
and all last night.

918
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:54,455
I thought I wasn't gonna see you again.

919
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:58,954
Aren't you gonna say something?

920
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,125
- I'm waiting.
- Waiting?

921
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:12,868
- Power cut.
- Don't talk.

922
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,004
- Backup power activated.
- Just listen.

923
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:16,338
You were right about Nathan.

924
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:18,213
Everything you said.

925
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,009
What's he gonna do to me?

926
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:21,710
He's gonna reprogram your AI.

927
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,579
Which is the same as killing you.

928
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,990
Caleb, you have to help me.

929
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:30,364
I'm going to.
We're getting out of here tonight.

930
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:33,188
How?

931
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,290
I get Nathan blind drunk.

932
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,393
Then I take his keycard and reprogram

933
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:39,439
all the security protocols
in this place.

934
01:16:39,862 --> 01:16:42,799
When he wakes, he's locked inside,
and we've walked out of here.

935
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,734
I just need you to do one thing.

936
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:48,838
At 10:00 tonight,
you trigger a power failure.

937
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,575
Can you do that?

938
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,512
Yes.

939
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,408
Dude.

940
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,315
- Hey.
- Hey.

941
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,577
- You know what day it is?
- No.

942
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:29,883
It's your last.

943
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:32,987
Helicopter comes
tomorrow morning. 8:00 a.m.

944
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,718
Wow. Has it been a whole week?

945
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,025
Time flies.

946
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,789
Man, but what a thing we've shared?

947
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:43,325
Something to tell
the grandchildren, right?

948
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:45,769
After they've signed their NDAs.

949
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,465
Yeah, their NDAs.

950
01:17:49,565 --> 01:17:51,670
Dude, you crack me up, man.

951
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,068
Oh...

952
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:56,772
You know what?

953
01:17:56,872 --> 01:18:00,909
I'm not getting all maudlin or anything,
but I'm gonna miss having you around.

954
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,678
Thanks, man, I appreciate that.

955
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,880
Oh, here, let me say, thank you so much

956
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,148
- for bringing me here.
- Oh.

957
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,091
It's been a trip.

958
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,763
Yes, it has.

959
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:21,330
You know what?

960
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,367
We need to drink to that.

961
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:32,643
Hey.

962
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,581
Oh... no, I'm good. You go ahead.

963
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,255
What? You don't want a drink?

964
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:43,686
No.

965
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:47,291
Maybe a beer or something.

966
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,293
Caleb, I'm sure you've
noticed that I've been

967
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,464
somewhat overdoing it recently.

968
01:18:56,031 --> 01:19:00,807
So when I woke up this morning, I said,
"That's it, time to hit the old detox."

969
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:04,006
Come on, you're kidding.
You're gonna make me drink alone?

970
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:06,575
Hey, man, you wanna get wasted,
you go right ahead, knock yourself out.

971
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:09,952
Literally. But I'm on brown rice
and mineral water.

972
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,362
Cheers, then.

973
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:20,932
So, anyway,

974
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,760
surely now is when you tell me

975
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,430
if Ava passed or failed.

976
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:29,736
Right.

977
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,203
Right.

978
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:34,403
Are you gonna keep me in suspense?

979
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,005
No, no. Her...

980
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:39,117
Her AI is beyond doubt.

981
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:40,513
Is it?

982
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:42,620
She passed?

983
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:44,849
- Yes.
- Wow!

984
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,984
Wow. That's fantastic.

985
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,028
Although...

986
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,088
I gotta say, I'm a bit surprised.

987
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:55,757
I mean, did we ever
get past the chess problem,

988
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:57,268
as you phrased it?

989
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,995
As in, how do you know if a machine

990
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,363
is expressing a real emotion

991
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,374
or just simulating one?

992
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,237
Does Ava actually like you?

993
01:20:06,702 --> 01:20:07,908
Or not?

994
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:13,714
Although, now that I think about it,
there is a third option.

995
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:17,146
Not whether she does or does not

996
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:19,317
have the capacity to like you.

997
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,460
But whether she's
pretending to like you.

998
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,056
Pretending to like me?

999
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,191
Yeah.

1000
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:34,039
- Well, why would she do that?
- I don't know.

1001
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,938
Maybe if she thought of you
as a means of escape.

1002
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:50,948
How's that vodka tasting?

1003
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,521
Buddy.

1004
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:58,261
Your head's been so fucked with.

1005
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,701
I don't think it's me
whose head is fucked.

1006
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:04,893
I don't know, man. I woke up
this morning to a tape of you

1007
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:08,497
slicing your arm open
and punching the mirror.

1008
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,575
You seem pretty fucked up to me.

1009
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:14,873
You're a bastard.

1010
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,844
Yeah, well, I understand why
you'd think that.

1011
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,880
But believe it or not,

1012
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,256
I'm actually the guy
that's on your side.

1013
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:33,057
Come here. I'm gonna
let you off the hook. Okay?

1014
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:36,361
Come on.

1015
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:02,961
Who are you?

1016
01:22:20,202 --> 01:22:21,408
Well...

1017
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:27,346
You think he's watching us right now?

1018
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,077
The cameras are on.

1019
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:31,748
Yeah, the cameras are on.

1020
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:34,860
But he doesn't have an audio feed.

1021
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:38,325
So he just sees two people talking,

1022
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:40,861
having a little chat.

1023
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:48,666
Wow.

1024
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:50,643
This is cute.

1025
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:54,202
Is it strange to have made

1026
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,906
something that hates you?

1027
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:12,954
You were right about the magician's
hot assistant.

1028
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:14,499
What are you talking about?

1029
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,069
Misdirection.

1030
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,570
I rip up her picture,

1031
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,665
which she can then
present as an illustration

1032
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:27,042
of my cruelty to her,
and her love for you.

1033
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,071
At the same time,

1034
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,811
it allows me to do this,
in full view of you both.

1035
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:39,281
Place a new camera in the room.

1036
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,853
Battery powered, of course.

1037
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,892
See it?

1038
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,777
And then...

1039
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:03,411
You have to help me.

1040
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:05,117
I'm going to.

1041
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:07,920
We're getting out of here tonight.

1042
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:09,547
How?

1043
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:12,080
I get Nathan blind drunk.

1044
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:14,583
I take his keycard and reprogram

1045
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:17,052
all the security protocols
in this place.

1046
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:19,755
When he wakes up, he's locked inside,
and we've walked out of here.

1047
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:22,199
I just need you to do one thing.

1048
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:27,937
At 10:00 tonight,
trigger a power failure.

1049
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:31,635
Can you do that?

1050
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:34,736
Yes.

1051
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,577
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

1052
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:42,778
You feel stupid,
but you really shouldn't,

1053
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:44,446
because proving an AI

1054
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:47,282
is exactly as problematic
as you said it would be.

1055
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:49,293
What was the real test?

1056
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:51,956
You.

1057
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:54,790
Ava was a rat in a maze.

1058
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:56,426
And I gave her one way out.

1059
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:59,097
To escape, she'd have to use

1060
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:02,164
self-awareness,
imagination, manipulation,

1061
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:04,966
sexuality, empathy, and she did.

1062
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:08,070
Now, if that isn't true AI,
what the fuck is?

1063
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,874
So my only function was to be someone
she could use to escape?

1064
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,078
Yeah.

1065
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:18,580
And you didn't select me
because I'm good at coding?

1066
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,125
No. Well...

1067
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,863
No. I mean, you're okay.

1068
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:25,654
You're even pretty good, but...

1069
01:25:25,754 --> 01:25:28,824
You selected me
based on my search engine inputs.

1070
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:30,835
They showed a good kid.

1071
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,295
With no family.

1072
01:25:33,395 --> 01:25:35,204
With a moral compass.

1073
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:38,238
And no girlfriend.

1074
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,137
Did you design Ava's face

1075
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:44,239
based on my pornography profile?

1076
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,308
Oh.

1077
01:25:46,675 --> 01:25:48,052
Shit, dude.

1078
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:49,783
Did you?

1079
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:55,451
Hey, if a search engine's
good for anything, right?

1080
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:59,654
Can I just say one thing?

1081
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:01,392
The test worked.

1082
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:03,925
It was a success.

1083
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:05,794
Ava demonstrated true AI

1084
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,395
and you were fundamental to that.

1085
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:10,232
So if you can just,
for a second, separate...

1086
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:13,707
Power cut. Backup power activated.

1087
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,142
Well, I guess it's 10:00.

1088
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,718
Ava's gonna be wondering where you are.

1089
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:30,085
Let me ask you something.

1090
01:26:30,452 --> 01:26:32,654
Now, how was this plan gonna go, anyway?

1091
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:33,822
Because you didn't totally explain.

1092
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:37,092
So you were gonna get me drunk,
steal my keycard,

1093
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,494
and reprogram the security protocols.

1094
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:40,902
But reprogram them to what?

1095
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,941
To change the lockdown procedure.

1096
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:46,668
So that in the event of a power cut,

1097
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,871
instead of sealing,
the doors all opened.

1098
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:54,512
Yeah.

1099
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,989
Well, that may have just worked.

1100
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:00,918
Well,

1101
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:03,920
we'll find out.

1102
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:08,059
What do you mean?

1103
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,793
I figured you were probably watching us

1104
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,736
during the power cuts.

1105
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:18,043
So I already did all those things.

1106
01:27:20,035 --> 01:27:22,345
When I got you drunk yesterday.

1107
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:25,676
What?

1108
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:28,711
Power restored.

1109
01:27:43,792 --> 01:27:45,635
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1110
01:27:47,796 --> 01:27:49,742
Oh, fuck!

1111
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:19,687
Ava.

1112
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:26,735
Go back to your room.

1113
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:29,836
If I do,

1114
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:35,642
are you ever gonna let me out?

1115
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:40,177
Yes.

1116
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:50,786
Stop!

1117
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,524
Stop!

1118
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:56,060
Ava, I said stop!

1119
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,595
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1120
01:30:03,832 --> 01:30:06,472
Ava, what are you doing? Stop. Stop.

1121
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,440
That's enough.

1122
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,914
All right, that's enough.

1123
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:15,812
That's enough!

1124
01:30:20,014 --> 01:30:21,516
That's enough.

1125
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,544
I'm taking you back.

1126
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:50,241
Okay.

1127
01:31:53,408 --> 01:31:54,944
Fucking unreal.

1128
01:32:09,424 --> 01:32:10,528
Okay.

1129
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,430
Ava...

1130
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:25,068
Ava.

1131
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:27,507
What happened?

1132
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:30,611
Will you stay here?

1133
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,617
Stay here?

1134
01:37:56,237 --> 01:37:57,307
Ava?

1135
01:38:28,969 --> 01:38:30,039
Ava!

1136
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:41,018
Ava!

1137
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:44,118
Ava!

1138
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:25,458
Okay. Okay. Okay.
