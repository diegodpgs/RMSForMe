00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:26,000
"Where life had no value,
death, sometimes, had its price. 
That is why the bounty killers appeared."

2
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,332
Tickets.

3
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:38,795
Tickets, please.

4
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,574
Thank you. Tickets.

5
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:50,081
Is it far to Tucumcari?

6
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,241
We should pass there
in about three or four minutes.

7
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:53,646
Thanks.

8
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:57,050
Excuse me, but you've
made a mistake, Reverend.

9
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,610
I couldn't help hearing
you're going to Tucumcari.

10
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:02,852
I peddle goods around here, and I better
tell you you're on the wrong train.

11
00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:09,959
I think the nearest stop
to Tucumcari is Amarillo.

12
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:13,294
By getting off at Sante Fe
and returning by way of Amarillo...

13
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:17,132
you should be able to get
right where you're going.

14
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:23,700
You see, the train
doesn't stop at Tucumcari.

15
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,382
This train'll stop at Tucumcari.

16
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,901
Take it easy, everybody!

17
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,234
Why'd you stop?
Something gone wrong?

18
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:09,500
Somebody pulled the emergency cord.

19
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:23,511
Hey, mister, you just can't pull
the emergency cord and jump off.

20
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:26,645
Why'd you stop that train?
If you want to get off, you...

21
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:31,181
Well, the railroad company'd be mighty
pleased to make any arrangements...

22
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:34,384
for any passenger if you want
to get off here, sir.

23
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,155
I did get off. Thanks.

24
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,961
All right, let's go!
Go ahead!

25
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:20,423
Guy passed by here in person
and added on those two zeros.

26
00:07:20,494 --> 00:07:24,122
He was spittin' mad when he saw what
they was offerin'. He wasn't flattered.

27
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:27,359
He said, "A measly thousand bucks
for me is much too little.

28
00:07:27,432 --> 00:07:30,264
I'm worth a lot more than that."

29
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:33,326
He said that, and then he added
the zeros on the thousand.

30
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,731
There isn't anyone got the guts
to face that killer, eh?

31
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,213
At least...

32
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:51,045
it's been that way till now.

33
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,642
Where is he?

34
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,094
Where is he?

35
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:00,369
I have no idea
where he'd be today.

36
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,053
- Hold still.
- But Guy...

37
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,020
- Hold still, I said.
- You hurt me with those hands of yours.

38
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,853
- Then do as I tell ya.
- Stop it!

39
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:33,792
Now see, you've made me drop the soap.

40
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:37,792
- Wait, I'll get it for ya.
- You're killing me.

41
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,767
Oh, look. What's that?

42
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:27,658
Pardon me, ma'am.

43
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,164
I'll kill you for this.

44
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,539
There you are.
A thousand dollars.

45
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:27,216
What do you know about Cavanagh?

46
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,350
About a week ago
he was seen at White Rocks.

47
00:12:30,426 --> 00:12:32,586
Thanks.

48
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,924
If it's of any interest to ya...

49
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:37,588
somebody else dropped in
to see me about him.

50
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:39,861
Who?

51
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,697
I'd never seen him before.

52
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:45,395
His name is Monco.

53
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,532
Light?

54
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:22,134
You know Baby Cavanagh?

55
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:27,934
Now tell me,
you know where I can find him?

56
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:37,972
There, at that table.

57
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,981
He's got his back to ya.

58
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:45,620
Thanks.

59
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:52,871
Two cards.

60
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,860
Didn't hear what the bet was.

61
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:39,561
Your life.

62
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,629
Alive or dead...
it's your choice.

63
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:17,065
Let Red go.

64
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:56,928
Two thousand dollars.
It's a lot of money.

65
00:17:56,997 --> 00:17:59,260
Takes me three years to earn it.

66
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:03,564
Tell me, isn't a sheriff
supposed to be courageous, loyal...

67
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:05,569
and above all, honest?

68
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,801
Yeah, that he is.

69
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:23,644
I think you people
need a new sheriff.

70
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:26,511
Hughie.

71
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,548
How are you, Nino?

72
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,549
Better when I see you.

73
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:21,660
Go on. Go ahead.

74
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:45,109
Open it.

75
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:07,256
- What's up? Who is it?
- Rodriguez, senor.

76
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,948
You. Come along.

77
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,134
I'm letting you live, hero.

78
00:23:59,201 --> 00:24:02,397
That's so you can tell everybody
you've seen what takes place here.

79
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:03,678
For the lousy money.

80
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:14,351
You took money
to put me behind bars.

81
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:19,322
You should've killed me
when you could.

82
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:22,090
It would be better for you.

83
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,417
And for them.

84
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:30,858
How old's the boy?

85
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:36,698
How old is the boy, I asked?

86
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,332
He's 18 months now.

87
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:43,640
Just the time that I was in jail.

88
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:48,607
You used the reward that you got...

89
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,113
to start raising a family.

90
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:55,012
And that's why I feel
your family is partly mine.

91
00:25:57,718 --> 00:26:00,118
I'll take my part now.

92
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:02,121
Outside.

93
00:26:05,624 --> 00:26:09,583
They're both innocent. Please let them go!
I was the one. You know that.

94
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:41,407
I know.
I'm sure you hate me just enough.

95
00:27:04,702 --> 00:27:07,263
This time you'll have a chance
to shoot me, but not in the back.

96
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,234
Let go.

97
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:20,942
When you hear the music finish, begin.

98
00:27:22,648 --> 00:27:24,582
Or do you think you can?

99
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:30,144
Let's start.

100
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:28,209
Now.

101
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,805
- Check those figures again.
- Yes, sir.

102
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:15,106
Good day, sir. Good afternoon.

103
00:30:15,178 --> 00:30:17,840
Mortimer.

104
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:20,974
- Douglas Mortimer.
- Mortimer. Virginia, isn't it?

105
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:23,743
- Carolina.
- That's right, Carolina.

106
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:26,082
Can I help in some way?

107
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:30,111
- I'm looking for a first-class bank.
- Oh, but exactly.

108
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:31,656
Yeah.

109
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:35,124
The largest and most secure bank
in the territory.

110
00:30:35,192 --> 00:30:37,990
Well, Mr. Mortimer,
I want to assure you our bank here...

111
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:40,723
has everything...
all the safeguards you're looking for.

112
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:44,061
I don't doubt that, but I have
a large sum to deposit.

113
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:46,259
Now, suppose I'm a bandit.

114
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:51,037
A bandit?

115
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:54,096
A very dangerous bandit
with a gang of killers.

116
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:58,872
What would be the most
impossible bank for me to rob?

117
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:02,608
In your case, the one bank
I would suggest is the Bank of El Paso.

118
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,806
Not even Indio would dare
to attack that one.

119
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:07,475
It's not a bank.
It's a fortress there.

120
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,920
What time's the next train
for El Paso?

121
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:17,423
11:30. I'll telegraph
to my colleague...

122
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,788
in the Bank of El Paso
that you're going to arrive.

123
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:21,918
Thanks.

124
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,675
Hey, mister. Captain.
General. Welcome.

125
00:31:49,748 --> 00:31:53,080
Do you need a stable or a room?
Do you want to take a bath?

126
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:55,914
My name is Fernando.
The stable is right here.

127
00:31:55,987 --> 00:31:57,783
And that is your hotel.

128
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:01,448
Why this hotel
and not some other?

129
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:04,186
You probably wouldn't like
that other place as much, senor.

130
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,490
You'd have to spend half the night
shootin' cockroaches.

131
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:09,961
At this hotel, the rooms
will cost you so much less.

132
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,020
And there's a landlady
at this one, senor.

133
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,965
- Married?
- Yes, but she doesn't care.

134
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:38,247
That's the bank. As soon as I get
some money, I'll put it in.

135
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:40,615
Well, you're gonna have
to earn it first.

136
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:44,989
I have 50 cents here for you
if you'll let me know...

137
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:49,549
when anybody you've never seen before
here in El Paso comes to town.

138
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:52,822
At the hotel, senor.
A stranger just came outta there.

139
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,935
Where's he staying?

140
00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:12,909
The hotel.

141
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:19,274
Let me know if you see
any more strangers.

142
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:21,578
Sure, senor.

143
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:40,092
- Help you, sir?
- I want the room right above.

144
00:33:40,163 --> 00:33:43,496
I'm sorry, it's occupied.
It's too bad.

145
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,432
The hotel's filled to capacity.
I'm sorry.

146
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:49,528
The room you want is our best.
It's always occupied.

147
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:50,798
By who?

148
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,568
Check the register.

149
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,232
Mary!

150
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,139
It's Senor Martinez.

151
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,982
- It's free now.
- That room is taken!

152
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:14,254
I'll see to it.

153
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:22,692
He's nothing but a wild,
vicious animal!

154
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:24,696
He's tall, isn't he?

155
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:30,735
You're just dirty!

156
00:34:43,044 --> 00:34:45,774
Proprietor, quick! My bill!

157
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:47,781
I want my bill!

158
00:34:50,017 --> 00:34:53,077
- Before he comes down, give me my bill.
- There's no need to check out.

159
00:34:53,153 --> 00:34:56,349
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'll give you another room immediately.

160
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:59,686
It's the best in the whole hotel.
We'll let him have the bridal suite.

161
00:34:59,758 --> 00:35:02,124
No, Mary, the bill.
I'd like to stay, only I can't.

162
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:04,922
- Don't go, Mr. Martinez.
- I have an appointment elsewhere.

163
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:11,359
Yes, senor, what do you want?

164
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:19,238
I don't wear 'em.

165
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:21,466
I'm honored that you thought of me.
Thank you.

166
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:03,830
Watch this.

167
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:29,590
Hello, my friends.

168
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,655
Hello, Indio.

169
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:35,696
You see, I didn't waste
a minute coming here.

170
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:38,662
Indio calls and Groggy
comes running right away.

171
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:40,222
And Sancho?

172
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:44,132
If you're waiting for Sancho, I'll go
and come back in about four years.

173
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:47,569
He's in prison for four years.

174
00:36:54,209 --> 00:36:57,770
Bad for him.
Not so bad for the rest of us.

175
00:36:57,845 --> 00:37:00,815
A man who gets caught
doesn't deserve respect, huh?

176
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:05,477
What's it all about, huh?

177
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:07,110
Now just listen.

178
00:37:11,488 --> 00:37:13,081
A bank at El Paso.

179
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,358
Let's see.

180
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:21,454
We'll say this is the inside
of the bank. Nino is the safe.

181
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,521
Which weighs three tons
and can't be opened with dynamite.

182
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:28,100
There's the part with two cashiers.

183
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:32,030
This is the manager's desk.

184
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:34,902
Right in back is a fancy cabinet
containing bottles...

185
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:37,566
for offering drinks
to the rich depositors.

186
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:43,572
There's the main door, and opposite
they built a double wall.

187
00:37:43,645 --> 00:37:45,613
What happens, Groggy?

188
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,674
Let's say you've already killed
the two cashiers and the manager.

189
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:53,686
For the next few minutes,
you're the boss of the bank.

190
00:37:53,753 --> 00:37:55,687
Now what?

191
00:37:56,722 --> 00:37:59,021
The time's been wasted.

192
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:04,324
Right, a waste of time.
Especially, Groggy, to blast open...

193
00:38:04,394 --> 00:38:08,125
that damn iron safe, we'd have
to be using so much dynamite...

194
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:11,133
that the whole bank
would just disappear.

195
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,191
And you'd all go up with it.

196
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:19,002
Besides, the presence of a safe alone
doesn't always signify...

197
00:38:19,074 --> 00:38:20,904
that there is money inside.

198
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:24,509
To help you understand what I mean...

199
00:38:26,844 --> 00:38:31,281
I would like to relate
a nice little parable.

200
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:36,682
Once upon a time
there was a carpenter.

201
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:41,148
You don't think a carpenter
can make money, eh?

202
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:44,656
No? You're wrong.

203
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:50,526
This one did well because
he was a builder of safes.

204
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,925
There was a banker once...

205
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,628
who decided he must have
his iron safe disguised...

206
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,227
to look like a wood cabinet.

207
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,340
To get it made...

208
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:10,004
the banker goes to our carpenter
for the job, and one day...

209
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:13,239
as destiny has it...

210
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:15,872
the carpenter's in El Paso.

211
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:19,146
He happens to walk into the bank there,
and what does he find?

212
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:21,346
The cabinet.

213
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:25,479
Since he'd worked on the cabinet,
he spotted it right away.

214
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:29,156
From that day on,
he couldn't work anymore.

215
00:39:29,226 --> 00:39:32,251
Pity, because...

216
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:35,160
there was something he had to do.

217
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:38,027
There was this crazy idea.

218
00:39:38,098 --> 00:39:40,031
And it stayed...

219
00:39:44,137 --> 00:39:46,900
to put his hands on the money inside.

220
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:48,906
Get in there and grab all the money.

221
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,542
Sure, you think that carpenter
was lucky the way things work out...

222
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:57,012
that he was lucky
to go in just that bank.

223
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:59,012
It wasn't true.

224
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:03,244
His good fortune stopped that day.

225
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,683
Because later...

226
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,685
as a prisoner...

227
00:40:10,422 --> 00:40:12,356
he ran into me.

228
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:20,786
The carpenter told me the story,
and I tell you.

229
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:29,532
The money isn't in the safe.
It's right in this!

230
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,699
Almost a million dollars in it.

231
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:41,069
Your colleague in Tucumcari told me
that this bank...

232
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:44,308
has the largest deposits
in the whole state.

233
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:46,508
Yes, that's correct,
Mr. Mortimer.

234
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:50,780
Here at the bank at El Paso we have half
a million dollars in reserve on hand.

235
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:57,656
I see. You sure this bank
is secure enough to hold that much?

236
00:40:57,726 --> 00:41:00,559
From the moment your money's
on deposit here...

237
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,560
you can sleep without any worries.

238
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,062
Besides...

239
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,862
when the bank is closed,
an armed guard always remains here...

240
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,562
and a patrol
is on guard outside.

241
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:17,628
Even the Bank of San Francisco
isn't that well protected.

242
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:21,368
Exactly. The truth is...

243
00:41:22,644 --> 00:41:24,702
to try robbing us
would be so futile...

244
00:41:24,778 --> 00:41:28,179
that only a complete fool
would attempt it.

245
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:30,341
Yeah.

246
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:32,474
Or a complete madman.

247
00:41:43,192 --> 00:41:45,352
Get out of the way!
Get out of here!

248
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:33,229
More news, amigo.

249
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:38,228
Another stranger in town?

250
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:40,928
Yes. And I know something else.

251
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:50,234
There was another stranger
I didn't tell you about.

252
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:53,277
Listen to me,
you sawed-off little runt!

253
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:55,834
I want to know how many men
there are all together.

254
00:42:55,912 --> 00:42:58,278
Well, there were two.
Now there's two more.

255
00:42:58,347 --> 00:43:00,747
Where?

256
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:03,183
In the saloon.

257
00:45:13,016 --> 00:45:14,346
Whiskey.

258
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:17,613
Listen, mister, why do you choose
my place to commit suicide?

259
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:21,086
I know that man.
It's a miracle you're alive.

260
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:24,784
Why should a man walk around with
a pistol and let himself be insulted?

261
00:45:24,857 --> 00:45:26,792
It's mighty strange.

262
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,827
If the hunchback didn't shoot you...

263
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:32,385
he had a very important reason,
that's all.

264
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,032
I was thinking that myself.

265
00:46:36,078 --> 00:46:38,671
1, 2...

266
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:42,977
3, now 4, now 5...

267
00:46:51,189 --> 00:46:54,557
11, 12, 13...

268
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:58,083
14, 15, 16...

269
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,563
17, 18, 19...

270
00:47:02,632 --> 00:47:06,829
20, 21, 22...

271
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,959
23, 24...

272
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,834
25, 26...

273
00:47:12,904 --> 00:47:17,968
27, 28, 29...

274
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,909
30, 31...

275
00:47:20,977 --> 00:47:24,310
32 and 33.

276
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:11,291
All right, now.

277
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:15,524
I don't know him!

278
00:49:15,596 --> 00:49:17,531
Come on, now, you know everybody.

279
00:49:17,597 --> 00:49:21,398
I don't know anybody anymore!
I'm dead! Understand?

280
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:23,935
Well, there was a time
when I knew everybody.

281
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,835
That was a long time ago
when all this was prairie.

282
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:29,305
In these days everybody's in a hurry.
That's right...

283
00:49:29,374 --> 00:49:31,968
with your damned
good-for-nothing trains!

284
00:49:35,345 --> 00:49:36,834
Disgusting!

285
00:49:36,912 --> 00:49:39,245
One day, someone from the railroad
comes here to see me.

286
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:42,978
He says, "Prophet, the railway's
gonna go right past your house."

287
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:45,986
"Is that so?" I said.

288
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:48,419
"Yep, that right," he says.

289
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:50,717
"All those trains
gonna go right past here.

290
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,121
The best thing for you, Prophet,
is sell your land to the company...

291
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:54,919
or else we'll buy Baker's.

292
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,756
He lives next to your place,
and I'll put the tracks here...

293
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,920
and that'll make you go crazy.

294
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:02,191
Will you sell out
to our company, Prophet?"

295
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:04,733
"Oh, is that so?" says I.

296
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:09,001
He was very anxious
for me to sell out.

297
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,335
You know what I told him
about the railroad?

298
00:50:11,404 --> 00:50:14,271
You know what I told him
he could do with his railroad?

299
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,016
You know what my decision
about selling was?

300
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,024
Well, you said no.

301
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:41,492
You're right about that.
No to him and his damn trains!

302
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,494
I wouldn't! No!

303
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:46,498
Look, listen to me, old man.

304
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:48,499
You're supposed to be a prophet.

305
00:50:48,565 --> 00:50:51,398
I didn't come here to listen to you
rattle on about trains.

306
00:50:51,469 --> 00:50:54,869
I want to find out about this man.
It's obvious you don't know anything.

307
00:50:54,937 --> 00:50:57,701
No need to be insulting.
If that's all you came here to do...

308
00:50:57,773 --> 00:51:00,741
you can clear out of my house fast
before I lose my temper.

309
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,744
Understand?

310
00:51:06,512 --> 00:51:08,707
Hey! Where you goin'?

311
00:51:11,716 --> 00:51:14,514
I guess I better leave before
you go and lose your temper.

312
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:17,918
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so dang stupid?

313
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:19,922
Hurry up,
give me that pistol there.

314
00:51:19,988 --> 00:51:22,423
Yeah, right there behind ya.

315
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,425
Hurry!

316
00:51:24,493 --> 00:51:27,894
Yes, that's the one.
Now, hand it over.

317
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:31,625
That's it. Give me that gun.
The man you asked about.

318
00:51:31,698 --> 00:51:34,691
There's only one question:
How does he carry his gun?

319
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:36,962
He wears it here,
across his belly?

320
00:51:37,036 --> 00:51:40,494
Well, why didn't you tell me that
in the first place, my boy.

321
00:51:40,573 --> 00:51:43,040
Of course I know the man
you're trying to find out about.

322
00:51:43,106 --> 00:51:45,041
Of course I know him.

323
00:51:45,108 --> 00:51:47,941
He's Colonel Douglas Mortimer.

324
00:51:48,011 --> 00:51:50,911
Mortimer... a brave man, a soldier.

325
00:51:51,745 --> 00:51:54,236
He was known as the best shot
in the Carolinas.

326
00:51:54,315 --> 00:51:55,942
A great soldier.

327
00:51:56,016 --> 00:51:59,918
Now he's reduced to being
a bounty killer, same as you.

328
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:01,749
Because of trains!

329
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,119
Because of the damn trains!
Damn 'em!

330
00:53:31,521 --> 00:53:35,458
Take it to the station.
The gentleman's leavin'.

331
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,857
Hold it.

332
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:45,296
Take it back.

333
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,659
Take it to the station.

334
00:53:52,736 --> 00:53:55,637
- Go inside.
- The station!

335
00:55:04,624 --> 00:55:06,818
Just like the games we know.

336
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:04,698
- He's picking it up.
- A trick, maybe.

337
00:57:50,446 --> 00:57:54,848
How can somebody in my business
go around with a contraption like this?

338
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,884
That contraption...

339
00:57:59,152 --> 00:58:01,348
almost sent you to your grave.

340
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:06,552
You're forgetting one thing, Colonel...
I was shooting at your hat.

341
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:08,854
Well, I was only shooting at yours.

342
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:12,191
But I recall firing first.

343
00:58:14,196 --> 00:58:16,027
Boy...

344
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:19,294
I've reached almost 50 years
of age with my system.

345
00:58:19,366 --> 00:58:21,699
Not many men last long
in these parts.

346
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,033
How long do you expect to last?

347
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:27,365
Much longer than that.

348
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:32,276
When I get my hands on Indio
and that $ 10,000...

349
00:58:32,344 --> 00:58:35,711
I'm gonna buy myself a little place,
possibly retire.

350
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:40,249
Well, I don't believe we ought
to start another fight.

351
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,375
But you forget one small detail.

352
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:43,975
What's that?

353
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,317
I wanna get my hands on Indio too.

354
00:58:46,388 --> 00:58:48,823
Sure, after me.

355
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:52,754
Or before you.

356
00:58:52,825 --> 00:58:54,760
Or at the same time.

357
00:58:57,897 --> 00:58:59,559
Is that a proposition?

358
00:59:00,965 --> 00:59:02,523
An equal partnership.

359
00:59:03,602 --> 00:59:05,466
Why? Why should I?

360
00:59:05,536 --> 00:59:07,469
I can think of three reasons.

361
00:59:07,538 --> 00:59:09,699
First is there's 14 of them.

362
00:59:09,771 --> 00:59:11,671
Yeah, that's a lot.

363
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:13,297
A lot for me.

364
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,901
Yeah. No small number
even for two of us.

365
00:59:15,977 --> 00:59:17,569
Second reason?

366
00:59:18,845 --> 00:59:20,904
Second reason...

367
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:26,077
The second reason is
you could make it 15 to one.

368
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,618
Don't forget I wanna play
in this game too.

369
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:33,088
As you're aware, when two hunters
go after the same prey...

370
00:59:33,156 --> 00:59:36,591
they usually end up shooting each other
in the back, and we don't want that.

371
00:59:40,963 --> 00:59:43,124
Then the colonel dies, hmm?

372
00:59:45,466 --> 00:59:47,365
All right, I'll be generous.

373
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:51,696
You can have the reward
for Indio...

374
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,965
and I'll take the reward
for the rest of the band.

375
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:59,367
All wrong.

376
00:59:59,443 --> 01:00:03,936
Indio's worth $ 10,000 dollars, but
the rest adds up to much more than that.

377
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:07,574
Blackie's worth four,
Wild's worth three, Nino two.

378
01:00:07,648 --> 01:00:09,310
Nino's one.

379
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:14,386
Well, Frisco's worth two.

380
01:00:14,453 --> 01:00:16,943
That's ten thousand.

381
01:00:17,022 --> 01:00:18,922
Yeah, but...

382
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:22,188
there's a few more that'll
add up to more than that, I'm sure.

383
01:00:22,259 --> 01:00:25,524
- How do you know that?
- I have my information.

384
01:00:25,595 --> 01:00:27,529
When all's said and done...

385
01:00:27,597 --> 01:00:30,657
I think I might just take you up
on your proposition.

386
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:36,166
Let's drink to this partnership.

387
01:00:39,905 --> 01:00:43,170
To the partnership,
with no tricks, of course.

388
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:46,004
No tricks.

389
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,412
Now, then...

390
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,884
you realize we're gonna have to figure
out some way to get them in the middle.

391
01:00:58,853 --> 01:01:02,788
One from the outside, one from
the inside. There's no other way.

392
01:01:02,855 --> 01:01:06,292
One of us will have to
join Indio's band.

393
01:01:08,461 --> 01:01:10,986
Why are you looking at me
when you say "one of us"?

394
01:01:11,062 --> 01:01:12,723
Because they don't know you.

395
01:01:12,797 --> 01:01:15,665
Wild sees me and his hump
will catch on fire.

396
01:01:18,269 --> 01:01:19,827
Tell me...

397
01:01:19,903 --> 01:01:23,066
how do you propose that I
join up with Indio?

398
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,106
Maybe bring him
a bunch of roses?

399
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:30,611
You could do that, but I'd suggest
you take him Sancho Perez.

400
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:32,975
Who's Sancho Perez?

401
01:01:33,046 --> 01:01:35,981
A friend of Indio's.
Right now he's cooling off.

402
01:01:36,048 --> 01:01:38,676
He's cooling off
in Alamogourdo jail.

403
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,310
How do you know all this?

404
01:01:42,518 --> 01:01:44,816
I've got my information too.

405
01:01:46,889 --> 01:01:50,916
Naturally, you'll have to arrange
for his, uh, release.

406
01:01:53,661 --> 01:01:54,458
Naturally.

407
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:58,931
Tell me...

408
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:01,466
were you ever young?

409
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:07,264
And just as reckless as you.

410
01:02:10,674 --> 01:02:13,608
Then one day something happened.

411
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:15,440
Made life very precious to me.

412
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,102
What's that?

413
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:25,483
Or is the question indiscreet?

414
01:02:28,488 --> 01:02:30,615
The question isn't indiscreet.

415
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:33,948
But the answer could be.

416
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:52,365
They told me you were put away. You'd be
resting for four long years in prison.

417
01:05:55,074 --> 01:05:59,011
No, Indio, for four weeks.
No more than four weeks.

418
01:06:10,653 --> 01:06:12,485
Who is that with you?

419
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:15,681
He got me out.
The man's a friend of mine.

420
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:26,198
Why did he help you?
Did you ask him that?

421
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,200
Yeah. Amigo, why did you
help me out?

422
01:06:33,169 --> 01:06:38,300
Well, there's such a big reward
being offered on all you gentlemen...

423
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:41,536
that I thought I might just tag along
on your next robbery.

424
01:06:42,809 --> 01:06:44,744
I might just turn you
into the law.

425
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:29,169
Amigo...

426
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:34,010
that's the one answer
that would prove you're all right.

427
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:39,676
And you arrived just in time too.
The job is already set.

428
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:42,313
It's tomorrow.

429
01:07:43,422 --> 01:07:45,515
The place is...

430
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:48,024
the bank in El Paso.

431
01:07:50,361 --> 01:07:53,524
Not far from El Paso
there's a little town, Santa Cruz.

432
01:07:53,597 --> 01:07:57,088
Tomorrow, Blackie, Chico,
Paco...

433
01:07:57,165 --> 01:08:00,328
and you, amigo...

434
01:08:00,402 --> 01:08:02,996
will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.

435
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:06,233
Shoot, kill, get every gun
in the area after you...

436
01:08:06,306 --> 01:08:08,240
especially those from El Paso.

437
01:08:08,307 --> 01:08:11,709
Any others around,
we'll take care of them.

438
01:08:13,544 --> 01:08:16,514
And then after the job,
we'll all meet again at Las Palmeras.

439
01:08:20,983 --> 01:08:23,214
Where are you going?

440
01:08:29,257 --> 01:08:32,055
Well, if there's gonna be
any shooting...

441
01:08:33,127 --> 01:08:35,060
I gotta get my rest.

442
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:56,888
Hey, amigo, you know when you told
that story yesterday, I fell for it.

443
01:08:56,961 --> 01:08:59,293
Big joke, wasn't it, amigo?

444
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:10,434
Who said I was jokin'?

445
01:09:12,706 --> 01:09:14,674
I don't get that.
If it's true...

446
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,174
Too bad you have to die.

447
01:09:21,346 --> 01:09:22,813
What is it?

448
01:10:18,655 --> 01:10:21,590
By now they should be
at Santa Cruz.

449
01:11:03,223 --> 01:11:04,748
Listen, shorty...

450
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:12,130
Indio and his band have just
robbed the bank here in town.

451
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,659
Now why don't you just sit down
and send out the alarm to El Paso...

452
01:11:15,737 --> 01:11:18,605
and the rest of the towns around here
and warn 'em, right?

453
01:11:18,673 --> 01:11:22,338
But, mister, I didn't hear any shots
at the bank, and I sure would have.

454
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:24,347
You might hear one.

455
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:26,041
The alarm.

456
01:12:09,564 --> 01:12:11,589
Easy now.

457
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:14,362
They've robbed the bank
at Santa Cruz!

458
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:17,699
Follow me!

459
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,779
Groggy, the telegraph wires.

460
01:15:52,509 --> 01:15:54,671
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day, sir.

461
01:15:57,682 --> 01:16:00,015
- Sir.
- Good afternoon.

462
01:17:50,106 --> 01:17:51,801
The other side.

463
01:18:35,789 --> 01:18:37,690
Eleven...

464
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:39,124
twelve...

465
01:18:42,129 --> 01:18:43,927
Fourteen...

466
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:26,972
Let's go!

467
01:22:50,236 --> 01:22:53,537
What are you doin' here?
You're not runnin' away, are you?

468
01:22:53,607 --> 01:22:55,336
No, I'm not running away.

469
01:22:55,409 --> 01:22:59,074
I'm going after them and I'm going
alone. Our partnership is dissolved.

470
01:22:59,147 --> 01:23:00,978
Boy, let's wait
and talk it over.

471
01:23:01,048 --> 01:23:05,180
All we've done is talk.
I've been reasonable with no results.

472
01:23:05,253 --> 01:23:08,553
Now take it easy. We only knew
the Santa Cruz part of this plan.

473
01:23:08,623 --> 01:23:11,752
You were the one who had
their strategy all worked out.

474
01:23:11,827 --> 01:23:14,456
- Now I'm gonna meet Indio.
- I see. I better go along.

475
01:23:15,531 --> 01:23:17,466
I'm going alone... Me.

476
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:20,936
I have an appointment with Indio
and I'm not gonna let anyone interfere.

477
01:23:21,004 --> 01:23:23,998
- You certain about that?
- That's right.

478
01:23:24,074 --> 01:23:26,542
In that case I'm sorry.

479
01:23:30,414 --> 01:23:35,114
That's not bad. Indio sent
four men to Santa Cruz.

480
01:23:35,186 --> 01:23:38,385
And one man returns...
a new man without a scratch.

481
01:23:38,457 --> 01:23:40,618
Mm-mm. Indio's no idiot.

482
01:23:40,691 --> 01:23:44,151
When you ride up to him and show him
that little nick, he might believe you.

483
01:23:45,231 --> 01:23:47,325
And don't forget,
that as of today...

484
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:50,029
the whole gang's worth
$40,000 more.

485
01:23:50,103 --> 01:23:53,130
That's the reward offered by the bank
to get the money back.

486
01:23:53,207 --> 01:23:57,008
- Is the partnership operating again?
- Just how do you figure?

487
01:23:57,076 --> 01:24:01,981
Try to convince Indio to go north,
and then go along the Rio Bravo.

488
01:24:02,049 --> 01:24:05,247
It's a good spot for an ambush
and we can get him between two fires.

489
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,122
You on the outside,
me on the inside, right?

490
01:24:10,492 --> 01:24:11,824
North?

491
01:24:16,065 --> 01:24:17,556
North.

492
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,450
Hughie.

493
01:24:46,297 --> 01:24:50,758
Wait a minute. We need time to open it
and this isn't the right place.

494
01:25:20,335 --> 01:25:21,927
And the others?

495
01:25:22,002 --> 01:25:23,470
Dead?

496
01:25:24,673 --> 01:25:29,169
After Santa Cruz, we headed for El Paso
and they hit us from all sides.

497
01:25:30,646 --> 01:25:33,980
And you just saved your own skin,
isn't that right, you yellow...

498
01:25:53,538 --> 01:25:56,838
You did your part of it.
Let's go.

499
01:25:56,909 --> 01:25:58,536
Which way we headed?

500
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:00,977
North.

501
01:26:01,046 --> 01:26:04,245
North? Along Rio Bravo canyon?

502
01:26:04,317 --> 01:26:05,909
Why not?

503
01:26:07,288 --> 01:26:09,756
Seems like a good place
for an ambush to me.

504
01:26:11,859 --> 01:26:13,794
You know a better way to go?

505
01:26:13,861 --> 01:26:15,796
Yeah, south.

506
01:26:17,865 --> 01:26:19,493
Ride to the border?

507
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:23,595
They'll never expect you to cross the
border now that the alarm's been sent.

508
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:32,309
Think we'll head east.

509
01:26:32,382 --> 01:26:35,716
There's a place I know about,
Agua Caliente.

510
01:26:36,786 --> 01:26:39,779
Here we are.
That's Agua Caliente.

511
01:26:40,858 --> 01:26:43,692
Yes, I have many friends here.

512
01:26:43,761 --> 01:26:45,695
It looks just like a morgue.

513
01:26:46,865 --> 01:26:48,890
But look out.

514
01:26:48,966 --> 01:26:51,094
It could be one so easily.

515
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:55,772
- They don't like strangers.
- No, they don't like anybody.

516
01:26:57,643 --> 01:27:01,580
Wild, you never saw
our friend here shoot, right?

517
01:27:05,685 --> 01:27:07,415
Did any of you?

518
01:27:10,424 --> 01:27:13,087
We don't know how you'd be
in emergencies.

519
01:27:14,193 --> 01:27:16,754
I was thinking,
this is the right place.

520
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:19,095
I got a way
you can show the men.

521
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:23,027
How's that?

522
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:26,269
Go into town alone, amigo.

523
01:30:12,925 --> 01:30:14,051
Bravo.

524
01:31:04,682 --> 01:31:07,447
Do you mind tellin' me
how you got here?

525
01:31:07,518 --> 01:31:10,079
I just reasoned it out.

526
01:31:10,154 --> 01:31:12,350
I figured you'd tell Indio...

527
01:31:12,423 --> 01:31:15,882
to do just exactly the opposite
of what we agreed...

528
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,828
and he's suspicious enough
to figure out somethin' else.

529
01:31:20,066 --> 01:31:23,662
Since El Paso was out of the question,
well, here I am.

530
01:31:25,972 --> 01:31:27,838
Rum... a double.

531
01:31:28,909 --> 01:31:30,844
Tequila for all of us.

532
01:31:48,595 --> 01:31:51,326
If it isn't the smoker.

533
01:32:02,478 --> 01:32:04,810
Remember me, amigo?

534
01:32:06,981 --> 01:32:10,145
Of course you do. El Paso.

535
01:32:13,223 --> 01:32:15,692
It's a small world.

536
01:32:15,758 --> 01:32:18,489
Yes, and very, very bad.

537
01:32:19,597 --> 01:32:22,761
Now, come on.
You light another match.

538
01:32:24,534 --> 01:32:28,836
I generally smoke just after I eat.
Come back in ten minutes.

539
01:32:28,906 --> 01:32:32,809
Ten minutes you'll be smoking
in hell. Get up!

540
01:32:32,877 --> 01:32:34,243
Stay calm.

541
01:32:36,548 --> 01:32:38,482
On your feet.

542
01:32:46,192 --> 01:32:47,854
Cucillo.

543
01:32:49,028 --> 01:32:50,519
Count to three.

544
01:33:00,442 --> 01:33:02,308
One...

545
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:05,806
two...

546
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:09,041
three!

547
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:14,483
Stop it!

548
01:33:36,781 --> 01:33:38,477
Who are you?

549
01:33:40,052 --> 01:33:41,987
I'm the one who can open
the safe for you.

550
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:48,192
What safe, senor?

551
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:51,697
The one from El Paso.
You got there ahead of me.

552
01:33:51,764 --> 01:33:53,699
- However...
- However?

553
01:33:55,603 --> 01:33:59,370
Open that safe and you're gonna
destroy half the bank notes.

554
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:01,965
I can open it
without blowing it up.

555
01:34:10,385 --> 01:34:11,853
What'll it cost?

556
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,410
Five thousand.

557
01:34:17,058 --> 01:34:18,993
Two's all I'll pay you.

558
01:34:20,129 --> 01:34:21,824
Five.

559
01:34:59,004 --> 01:35:00,939
Keep your hands off it!

560
01:35:01,007 --> 01:35:04,466
It's easy to steal.
The trouble is in keeping the loot.

561
01:35:04,544 --> 01:35:06,809
Take it out.

562
01:35:06,881 --> 01:35:09,180
Now every man in New Mexico
is after us.

563
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:12,914
If they catch one of us with money
we'll all end up the same way.

564
01:35:12,987 --> 01:35:16,891
We're going to wait here for an
entire month if I think it's necessary.

565
01:35:16,959 --> 01:35:19,929
Then everybody will get his share.

566
01:35:19,995 --> 01:35:22,362
And you will wait a month
to get your money.

567
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:25,328
Naturally.

568
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:27,768
I'll be in the tavern.

569
01:35:27,837 --> 01:35:31,968
The air around here stinks anyway,
just like the food.

570
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:34,010
But the month will go fast.

571
01:36:14,255 --> 01:36:15,689
Right here.

572
01:36:16,757 --> 01:36:18,350
Let's go.

573
01:38:42,685 --> 01:38:44,881
I was worried about you.

574
01:38:44,955 --> 01:38:48,824
All alone with, uh,
so many problems to solve.

575
01:39:05,443 --> 01:39:07,571
It's all right here.

576
01:39:12,918 --> 01:39:14,579
Go ahead.

577
01:40:22,929 --> 01:40:25,490
You shouldn't have shot
the apples off that tree.

578
01:40:37,478 --> 01:40:38,911
Put it on.

579
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:30,518
Stop it!

580
01:42:34,018 --> 01:42:37,518
You will see that they're tight securely.
Slim, keep your eye on it.

581
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:38,518
Why let them live?

582
01:42:39,516 --> 01:42:41,016
All things at the right time.

583
01:42:42,516 --> 01:42:43,017
Indio?

584
01:42:44,215 --> 01:42:47,208
What's he doing now,
this sheriff of El Paso?

585
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:50,552
Right now? Lookin' for the cash
that was in the bank.

586
01:42:51,690 --> 01:42:53,488
Right.

587
01:42:53,559 --> 01:42:58,362
And suppose he finds the bodies
of these men just outside El Paso...

588
01:42:58,431 --> 01:43:00,729
with lots of money on them?

589
01:43:02,269 --> 01:43:04,238
What will the sheriff think?

590
01:43:04,304 --> 01:43:06,101
Well, he...

591
01:43:06,173 --> 01:43:07,903
That's right.

592
01:44:24,495 --> 01:44:26,019
Slim.

593
01:44:29,267 --> 01:44:30,859
What is it, Nino?

594
01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:34,499
A change of plans.

595
01:44:34,573 --> 01:44:36,803
Indio wants you to...

596
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:20,122
It's not loaded.

597
01:45:43,916 --> 01:45:46,545
I think you should
get out fast now.

598
01:45:46,619 --> 01:45:49,885
Here's your guns without bullets.

599
01:45:49,955 --> 01:45:52,857
Listen. Don't you let Indio
find you both around.

600
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:45,039
I know you don't like questions,
but why are you doing this?

601
01:46:48,053 --> 01:46:51,046
How long have you known
that Monco's a bounty killer?

602
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,225
I found out tonight. Why?

603
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:01,459
I knew he was one from
the first moment he arrived.

604
01:47:07,175 --> 01:47:10,111
The other one's also
a bounty killer.

605
01:47:11,713 --> 01:47:13,773
So I have an idea.

606
01:47:13,848 --> 01:47:16,010
They'll be useful to us.

607
01:47:17,352 --> 01:47:18,980
We'll try it.

608
01:47:20,055 --> 01:47:23,549
Those men are a lot better
than mine with a gun.

609
01:47:23,626 --> 01:47:27,893
So we'll let all of them
get mixed up in a gun battle.

610
01:47:27,964 --> 01:47:30,900
But that won't
really matter to me.

611
01:47:33,503 --> 01:47:35,028
Or you.

612
01:47:37,173 --> 01:47:40,201
Because we'll be far away, right?

613
01:47:45,683 --> 01:47:48,380
And we'll have all the money.

614
01:47:50,956 --> 01:47:52,754
Go on.

615
01:47:52,825 --> 01:47:55,056
Go on and wake Cucillo.

616
01:48:44,515 --> 01:48:45,847
Who did it?

617
01:48:45,917 --> 01:48:48,478
Why don't you look
at the knife?

618
01:48:56,762 --> 01:48:58,730
It's mine.

619
01:48:58,798 --> 01:49:01,768
Then it shouldn't be there,
should it?

620
01:49:11,377 --> 01:49:14,541
But I didn't kill him.
I didn't do it.

621
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:19,714
It's difficult to prove that.

622
01:49:22,457 --> 01:49:23,947
I am innocent.

623
01:49:24,024 --> 01:49:26,550
One of your horses is outside.

624
01:49:27,630 --> 01:49:30,099
Let's see if you can get to it.

625
01:50:17,851 --> 01:50:19,341
He just killed Slim.

626
01:50:21,321 --> 01:50:25,554
And he... he helped those
two bounty killers get away.

627
01:50:29,363 --> 01:50:30,921
I want them back...

628
01:50:32,568 --> 01:50:34,263
right now.

629
01:50:47,184 --> 01:50:49,483
What are you doing here?

630
01:50:49,552 --> 01:50:52,044
Go and get them back!

631
01:50:56,293 --> 01:51:01,130
Those two bounty killers are sitting on
our backs and must be killed right away.

632
01:51:06,204 --> 01:51:08,139
We can't let 'em go free.

633
01:51:23,056 --> 01:51:24,614
It's done now.

634
01:51:26,627 --> 01:51:28,926
Prepare to get out of here.

635
01:52:11,877 --> 01:52:13,140
Here.

636
01:52:14,913 --> 01:52:16,575
Hold it.

637
01:52:21,187 --> 01:52:24,056
Not a bad idea.

638
01:52:24,124 --> 01:52:26,649
But I'm one thing
you forgot about.

639
01:52:26,727 --> 01:52:28,423
Open it up now.

640
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:52,451
All right, come on now,
open it.

641
01:53:50,919 --> 01:53:53,115
Leave Indio to me.

642
01:53:56,024 --> 01:53:57,549
All right.

643
01:54:29,895 --> 01:54:32,023
Where in hell is it?

644
01:55:00,296 --> 01:55:03,789
I'll kill 'em, but I'll rip
out their guts first.

645
01:55:03,866 --> 01:55:05,801
I have a plan.

646
01:55:12,243 --> 01:55:14,269
What?

647
01:55:14,345 --> 01:55:16,473
Let's just wait.

648
01:55:16,547 --> 01:55:18,675
They'll be back here.

649
01:55:20,718 --> 01:55:23,985
And this way,
there'll be two of us.

650
01:55:24,055 --> 01:55:27,219
Can they come back here?
Your men could've killed them.

651
01:55:27,293 --> 01:55:29,227
Who? They?

652
01:55:32,632 --> 01:55:36,228
Are you sure of that?
That they haven't?

653
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,036
I thought something different.

654
01:55:42,109 --> 01:55:46,946
You made the boys ride on out to
make sure they're both killed, and fast.

655
01:55:47,014 --> 01:55:50,212
I'm not as dumb
as the rest of them.

656
01:55:51,386 --> 01:55:53,321
There was no help for it.

657
01:57:26,858 --> 01:57:28,383
Go on.

658
01:59:16,378 --> 01:59:17,812
That watch...

659
01:59:19,281 --> 01:59:22,080
It's been a long time
that I wanted to ask.

660
01:59:23,553 --> 01:59:26,318
I can see that it means
a lot to you.

661
01:59:26,389 --> 01:59:27,913
Why?

662
02:01:04,631 --> 02:01:06,223
Listen to me!

663
02:01:08,067 --> 02:01:10,229
This is Colonel Mortimer!

664
02:01:12,841 --> 02:01:14,468
Douglas Mortimer!

665
02:01:16,744 --> 02:01:19,145
Does the name
mean anything to you?

666
02:02:51,715 --> 02:02:54,947
When the chimes end,
pick up your gun.

667
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:57,387
Try and shoot me, Colonel.

668
02:03:00,026 --> 02:03:02,051
Just try.

669
02:04:57,154 --> 02:04:59,555
Very careless of you, old man.

670
02:05:25,785 --> 02:05:27,412
Try this.

671
02:05:34,562 --> 02:05:36,496
Now we start.

672
02:07:27,154 --> 02:07:28,451
Bravo.

673
02:08:10,033 --> 02:08:12,628
There seems to be
a family resemblance.

674
02:08:19,009 --> 02:08:20,602
Here.

675
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:28,243
Naturally, between
brother and sister.

676
02:08:28,321 --> 02:08:29,913
My gun.

677
02:08:34,995 --> 02:08:36,257
My boy...

678
02:08:37,331 --> 02:08:39,698
you've become rich.

679
02:08:39,767 --> 02:08:42,430
You mean we've become rich,
old man.

680
02:08:42,504 --> 02:08:45,565
No, it's all for you.
I think you deserve it.

681
02:08:46,673 --> 02:08:49,006
What about our partnership?

682
02:08:51,446 --> 02:08:53,107
Maybe next time.

683
02:09:35,795 --> 02:09:40,028
Ten thousand, twelve thousand...

684
02:09:40,098 --> 02:09:41,498
fifteen...

685
02:09:42,569 --> 02:09:44,231
sixteen...

686
02:09:44,305 --> 02:09:45,602
seventeen...

687
02:09:47,341 --> 02:09:49,571
twenty-two...

688
02:09:57,017 --> 02:09:59,043
Twenty-seven.

689
02:10:00,722 --> 02:10:02,190
Any trouble, boy?

690
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:06,352
No, old man.

691
02:10:07,729 --> 02:10:10,790
Thought I was having trouble
with my adding.

692
02:10:10,867 --> 02:10:12,266
It's all right now.
