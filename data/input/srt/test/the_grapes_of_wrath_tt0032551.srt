298
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,800
Oh, thank God! Thank God!

299
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,700
Tommy.!

300
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
Ma.

301
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,100
Oh!
[Sighs]

302
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,100
You didn't bust out, did you?
You ain't gotta hide, have ya?

303
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,400
No, Ma, I'm paroled.
I got my papers.

304
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,100
Oh. I was so scared we was
goin' away without you...

305
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,400
and we'd never
see each other again.

306
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,200
I'd have found you, Ma.

307
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,500
Muley told me what happened.

308
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,700
You goin' to California true?

309
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,500
Oh, we got to go, Tommy,
but it's gonna be all right.

310
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,800
I seen the handbills about how much work
they is and high wages too.

311
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,300
There's somethin' I gotta
find out first, Tommy.

312
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you
and make you mean mad?

313
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,600
- Mad, Ma?
- Sometimes they do.

314
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,500
No, Ma. I was at first,
but not no more.

315
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Sometimes they
do somethin' to you.

316
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,500
They hurt you and you get mad
and then you get mean.

317
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Then they hurt you again
and you get meaner and meaner...

318
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,800
till you ain't no boy
nor man anymore...

319
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,000
just a walkin' chunk of
mean mad.

320
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Did they hurt you
that way, son?

321
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,300
No, Ma,
don't worry about that.

322
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Well, l...
I don't want no mean son.

323
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,800
- It's Tommy! It's Tommy back!
- [Girl] Tommy.!

324
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,000
- What'd you do, son, bust out?
- * Tommy's out of jail *

325
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,100
- * Tommy's out of jail, Tommy's out of... **
- l... I knowed it!

326
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,600
You couldn't keep him in!
You can't keep a Joad in jail!

327
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,100
I knowed it
from the first!

328
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,300
Get out of my way!
I told you so! I told you!

329
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,200
Tom'd come bustin' out of that jail
just like a bull through a corral fence!

330
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
- You can't keep a Joad in jail!
- I didn't bust out. They paroled me.

331
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
L-I was that way myself.

332
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
How are you,
UncleJohn?

333
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,600
- Hello, Tommy. I'm feelin' fine.
- You can't keep a Joad in jail.!

334
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,700
- How are you, Noah?
- Fine, Tommy.

335
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,300
- Bust out?
- No, paroled.

336
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400

Jailbird's back!

341
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,200
- Hiya, Al.!
- Hello, Tom. Did you bust out of jail?

342
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,400
- Nah. They paroled me.
- Aw...

343

Rosasharn!

344
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,100
Busted out!

345
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
That's Connie Rivers with her.
They're married now.

346
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,100
She's due now about
three, four months.

347
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,000
She wasn't any more than a kid
when I went up.

348
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,100
- Hi, Rosasharn.
- How are you, Tom?

349
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,500
Uh, this is Connie,
my husband.

350
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,100
- Did you...
- I'm on parole.

351
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,400
Eh, if this don't beat all.
I see I'm gonna be an uncle soon.

00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,700
- Oh, you do not!

Hey, Joad! John Joad!

357
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,100
- You ain't forgot, have you?
- We ain't forgot.

358
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,500
We'll be comin' through here
tomorrow, you know.

359
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,800
I know.
We be out.

360
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
We be out by sunup.

361
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
How'd you get
all this money?

362
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,000
We sold things, chopped cotton...
even Grandpa.

363
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,000
Got us about $200,
all told.

364
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,500
Shucked out 75
for this here truck.

365
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,300
Still got nearly 150
to set out on.

366
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,700
I figure we ought to be able
make her on that.

367
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Easy. After all, they ain't but
about 12 of us, is they?

368
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,800
- She'll probably ride like
a bull calf, but she'll ride!
- Tom.!

369
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, I reckon we better
begin roustin' 'em out...

370
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
if we aim to get out of here
by daylight.

371
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,400

How are you boys comin'?

- Here kids. Kids, you climb up on top.

382
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,600
Al's gonna drive, Ma. You set up there with
him and Grandma, and we'll swap around later.

383
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,100
- Where we go, Pa?
- Connie, help Rosasharn
up there alongside the kids.

Grandpa! Grandpa!

388
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,000
Well, save my place. John, you and Noah
climb up and find yourself a place.

389

If it does, it'll be a miracle
out of scripture.

[Muttering]

399
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,000
Should've left me alone,
that's all. That's all wh...

400
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,100
- What's the matter, Grandpa?

What's the matter?
There's nothin' the matter.

I just...
I just ain't goin', that's all.

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What do you mean, you ain't goin'?
We got to go.

404

We got no place to stay.

I ain't talkin' about you!
I'm-I'm talkin' about me!

I give her a good goin' over
all last night, and I'm a-stayin'.

407
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
But you can't do that,
Grandpa!

This here land's goin' under the tractor.
We all got to get out.

And I'm twice the man
that Muley is!

414
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,900
Now, listen to me, Grandpa.
Listen to me just a minute.

And I ain't listenin',
either!

if there's oranges and grapes
a-crowdin' a feller out of bed!

I ain't goin' to California!
[Muttering]

420
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,800
This is my country,
and I belong here! Yes, my...

00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,800
my dirt.
[Chuckles]

It's no good, but it's...
it's mine, all mine.

423
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Either we gotta tie him up and throw him
in the truck or somethin'. He can't stay here.

424
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,500
No, can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him,
or he'll get so mad he'll hurt hisself.

425
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,900
- Reckon we could get him drunk?
- Ain't no whiskey, is there?

426
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,600
Now, wait. They's a half a bottle
of soothin' syrup here.

427
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,900
Here. Used to put
the children to sleep.

428
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,300
- Don't taste bad.
- There's some coffee left.
We can fix him a cup.

429
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
That's right,
and douse some in it.

430
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Better give him a good dose.
He's mighty muleheaded.

431
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,500
If Muley...

432

If Muley can
scrabble along, l...

I guess I can.

434
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
I smell spareribs.

435
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,300
Huh. Somebody's
been eatin' spareribs.

436

How come I ain't got none?

437
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,300
Well, I got some saved for you, Grandpa.
Got some a-warmin' now.

438
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,000
- Eh?
- But here's a cup of coffee for you first.

439
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,700
[Mumbles]
Uh, get me a mess of spareribs.

440
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,700
I want a great big
mess of spareribs!

441
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,900
I'm-I'm hungry.

442
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,300
Why, sure,
you're hungry.

443
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:29,200
[Chuckles]
I sure do like spareribs.

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Yeah.

445
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,700
- Get up there, Noah.
- Put his feet in there first, now.

446
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,600
- [Squealing, Laughing]
- Lend a hand. Easy, now. Easy!

447
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,400
Better throw somethin' over him
so he won't get sunstruck. [Indistinct]

448
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,400
Everything all set now?
All right! Let her go, Al!

449
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,000
- Here we go!
- [All Chattering]

- Get aboard, Ma!
- [Grandpa Mumbling]

- Well, good-bye and good luck.
- Hold it, Al!

452
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,900
- Ain't you goin' with us?
- I'd like to.

453
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,500
There's somethin' goin' on
out there in the West...

454
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,600
and I'd like to try
and learn what it is...

455
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
if you feel you got the room.

456
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,400
- Mmm.
- Plenty of room! Get on!

457
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,800
- Hop on, Casy!
- Let her go, Al!

458
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,100

Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?
Give the old place a last look?

462
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,100
We're goin' to California, ain't we?
All right, then, let's go to California.

463
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,200
That don't sound like you, Ma.
You never was like that before.

464
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,800
I never had my house
pushed over before.

465
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Never had my family
stuck out in the road...

466
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,700
never had to lose everything
I had in life.

469
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,000
- That's good right there, Ma.
- I ain't goin'! I ain't goin'.

I ain't goin'. I ain't...
I ain't a-goin'.

471
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,500
It's all right, Grandpa.

472
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,900
You're just tired,
that's all.

473
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:38,900
That's it...
just tired.

474
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,400
Just... tired.

"Nobody killed him.
Just a stroke and he died."

481
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,400
Figure best we leave
something like this on him...

482
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,800
- unless somebody digs him up,
makes out he was killed.
- Hmm.

483
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,400
Looks like a lot of times
the government's got more interest...

484
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,400
in a dead man
than a live one.

485
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,300
Not be so lonesome,
knowin' his name's there with him.

486
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,100
Not just an old fella
lonesome underground.

[Sighs]

488
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,000
Won't you say
a few words, Casy?

489
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,100
I ain't a preacher no more,
you know.

490
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,300
We know, but ain't none of our folks
ever been buried without a few words.

491
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,200
I'll say 'em,
make it short.

492
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:38,700
This here old man just lived a life
and just died out of it.

I don't know whether
he was good or bad.

It don't matter much.

495
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Heard a fella
say a poem once...

496
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,900
and he says,
"All that lives is holy."

497
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Well, I wouldn't pray just for an old man
that's dead, 'cause he's all right.

498
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:05,200
If I was to pray, I'd pray for folks that's
alive and don't know which way to turn.

499
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:11,500
Grandpa here,
he ain't got no more trouble like that.

500
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,800
He's got his job
all cut out for him, so...

- What state you all from?
- Oklahoma.

519
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,100
Had us a farm there,
sharecroppin'.

520

We're from Arkansas.

521

Had me a store there...
kind of a general notions store.

When the farms went,
the stores went too.

as you ever saw.

Well, you can't tell.

526
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,500
I figure when we get out there
and get work...

527
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,600
and maybe get us a piece of growin' land
near water, it might not be so bad at that.

528
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,500
That's right.

a pot of money.

No, we ain't got no money...

532
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,600
but there's plenty of us to work,
and we're all good men.

533
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,300
Get good wages out there and put it
all together, and we'll be all right.

00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,200
Good wages, eh?
Pickin' oranges and peaches?

- Well, we aim to take whatever they got.
- What's so funny about that?

[Laughs] What's so funny about it?
I've just been out there. I've been and seen it.

537
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm goin' back and starve,
because I'd rather starve all over at once.

Say, what do you think
you're talkin' about?

539
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,900
I got a handbill here says
they're payin' good wages.

540
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,400
And I seen the papers
that they need pickers.

All right, go on.
Nobody's stoppin' ya.

- Yeah, but what about this?
- I ain't gonna rile ya. Go on.

543

What a minute, buddy. You just done
some jackassin'. You can't shut up now.

544
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,400
The handbill says
they need 800 pickers.

545
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,300
You laugh and say they don't.
Which one's the liar?

546
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,400
How many of you all
got them handbills?

547
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,000
- I got one.
- Come on. How many?

548
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,900
- [Men] I got one.
- We all got one.

549
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,600
What does that prove?

550
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,600
There you are...
same yellow handbill.

551
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,700
"700 pickers wanted."

552
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
All right.
The man wants 700 men...

553
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,900
so he prints 5,000 handbills,
and maybe 20,000 people see them...

554
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,800
and maybe two or three thousand people
start west on account of that handbill.

555
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,900
Two or three thousand people
that are crazy with worry...

556
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,100
heading out for 700 jobs.

557
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,100
- Now, does that make sense?
- Say, what are you, a troublemaker?

558
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,500
You sure you ain't
one of them labor fakes?

L... I swear I ain't, mister.

00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,500
Well, don't you go around here
trying to stir up any trouble.

561
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,800
I tried to tell you folks
what it took me a year to find out.

562
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,100
Took two kids dead,
took my wife dead to show me...

563
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,600
but nobody could tell me,
neither.

564
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,000
I can't tell you about them little fellas
layin' in their tent...

565
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,000
with their bellies swelled out
and just skin over their bones...

566
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,500
a-shiverin'and
a-whinin'like pups.

567
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,700
And me a-runnin'around
lookin'for work...

568
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,200
not for money, not for wages...

569
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,500
just for a cup offlour
and a spoon oflard.

570
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,800
Then the coroner come.

571
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,900
"Them children died of heart failure,"
he said. He put it down on his paper.

572
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,100
Heart failure?

573
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,500
And their little bellies
stuck out like a pig bladder?

574
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,200
Well, guess we gotta
get some sleep.

Well, good night, folks.

576
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,000
Suppose he's tellin'
the truth, that fella?

577

He's tellin' the truth...

578
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,000
the truth for him.

579
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,700
He wasn't
makin' it up.

580
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,600
Was it the truth
for us?

581
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,000
I don't know.

I done was asked.

chocolate cream

01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,800
Five cents?
They payin' you five cents?

1037
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:33,900
- Sure. We made a buck since midday.
- Lookee, Tom...

1038
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,400
we come here to work.

1039
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:40,300
They tell us there's gonna be five cents,
but there's a whole lot of us...

1040
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,900
so the man says
21/2 cents.

1041
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,600
Well, a fella can't even eat on that,
and if he's got kids...

1042
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:51,300
So we says we won't take it,
so they drive us off.

1043
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,400
Now they're payin' you
five cents.

1044
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,100
But if they bust this strike,
you think they'll pay five?

1045
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,200
Don't know.
Payin' five now.

1046
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:02,000
They'll get 21/2 cents
just the minute we're gone.

1047
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,200
You know what that is...

1048
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:08,400
one ton of peaches
picked and carried for a dollar.

1049
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,300
That way, you can't even buy
enough food to keep you alive.

1050
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,300
Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom.
Them peaches is ripe!

1051
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,200
Two days out and they'll pay us...
pay us all five, maybe seven.

1052
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:25,900
No, they won't. They're gettin' five now.
That's all they care about.

1053
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,400
But the moment they ain't strikebreakin',
they won't get no five.

1054
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:33,400
Next thing you know, you'll be out.
They got it all fixed down to a T.

1055
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,800
Well, soon as the harvest is in,
you're a migrant worker.

1056
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:38,000
Afterwards, just a bum.

1057
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:41,200
Five they're gettin' now,
that's all they're interested in.

1058
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:44,600
I know exactly what Pa would say.
He'd just say it's none of his business.

1059
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:47,900
Guess that's right. He'll have to
take a beatin' before he'll know.

1060
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:50,900
Take a beatin'?
We was out of food!

1061
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,300
Tonight we had meat.
Not much, but we had it.

1062
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:59,000
You think Pa's gonna give up his meat on...
on account of some other fellas?

1063
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,200
Rosasharn needs milk.

1064
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:03,400
You think Ma's
gonna starve that baby...

1065
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:06,200
just on account of fellas yellin'
outside a gate?

1066
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:09,300
Tom, you gotta learn
like I'm learnin'.

1067
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,500
I don't know it right yet myself,
but I'm tryin' to find out.

1068
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,800
That's why I can't ever
be a preacher again.

1069
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,200
Preachers gotta know.

1070
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:21,500
I don't know.

1071
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,700
I gotta ask.

1072
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,200
- I don't like it.
- What's the matter?

1073
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,400
I can't tell. It seems as though
l-I hear somethin'.

1074
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,600
Then when I listen,
there ain't nothin' to hear.

1075
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,700
Well, it ain't out
of the question, you know.

1076
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,000
We're all a little itchy. Cops been tellin' us
how they're gonna beat us up.

1077
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:43,200
Not them regular deputies, but them
tin-shield men, the ones they got for guards.

1078
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:46,700
[Chuckles] They figure I'm the leader
'cause I talk so much.

1079
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,800
Turn out the light. Come outside.
There's somethin' here.

1080
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:59,300
- What is it?
- I don't know. Listen.

1081
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,000
Can't tell whether you hear it or not.
You hear it, Tom?

1082
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,200
I hear it.

1083
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,900
I think it's some guys
comin' this way, a lot of'em.

1084
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,600
- We got to get out of here.
- Down that way, under the bridge span.!

Listen, you fellas,
you don't know what you're doin'!

- Ah, shut up, you dirty...

1088
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,600
- You've killed him!
- Serves him right too.

1089
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:53,700
Look out!

1090
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:06,100
Boy, he's good and dead.
Did you see the fella that done it?

1091
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,300
I ain't sure, but I caught him
one across the face.

1092
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,400
He'll have a trademark
he won't be able to get rid of.

How does it feel?

Busted my cheek,
but I can still see.

- What'd you hear?
- Looks like you done it.

1109
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,500
I thought so.
It felt like it.

1110

Folks ain't talkin'
about much else.

1111

They say they got
posses out.

Talkin' about a lynchin'
when they catch the fella.

They killed Casy first.

That ain't the way
they're tellin' it.

They're sayin'
you done it first.

Do they know...
what the fella looks like?

They know he got hit
in the face.

I'm sorry, Ma.

any more than when you take a breath.

I was gonna do it.

Oh, it's all right, Tommy.

I wished you didn't do it...

what you had to do.

ain't gonna ease us.

There was a time
we was on the land.

There was a boundary
to us then.

We was always one thing.

- And you say no cops?

without a warrant.

Hey, Jackson, look.
Did you ever see them fellas before?

Sorry, neighbor, but, uh,
we got to keep the camp clean.

I know one of'em.
I used to work with him.

I never asked him
to the dance, though.

1350

All right, keep your eye on him.
Just keep 'em in sight, that's all.

up on the main road.

for? How come they can't let us alone?

We ought to get ourselves
some pickax handles and...

No. That's just what they want.
No sirree.

call in the cops, say we ain't orderly.

hurtin' them fellas now.

You don't need to worry. We got everything
arranged. Maybe nobody will even see it.

Sure, Ma.

1478
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:45,300
Tom, we... we ain't
the kissin' kind, but...

1479
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:55,500
Good-bye, Ma.

1480
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:57,800
Good-bye, Tommy.

1481
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,200
Tommy.

1482
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:46,000
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1483
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,100
Be good.

1484
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:51,900
Bye.

1485
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:56,300
Hurry that up now. Get her rolled up.
How you fixed, John?

1486
02:04:56,400 --> 02:05:00,000
- Ah, gettin' along fine.
- Here. Here.

1487
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:02,400
Winfield, you get up on top now.
Get out of the way.

1488
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:06,800
I don't see what you folks are hurryin' so for.
They tell me there's 20 days' work up there.

1489
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:09,700
Yes, sir.
And we aim to get in all 20 of them.

1490
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:13,200
- All ready, Ma?
- Yes. How you feelin', Rosasharn?

1491
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:16,700
All aboard, everybody.
All aboard for Fresno.

1492
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:19,200
Wait a minute
and I'll give you a hand.

1493
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:22,700
- Careful of her now.
- Easy, child.

1494
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,800
She'll be all right.

1495
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:37,100
- Watch her, John. Take care of her.
- I'll take care of her.

1496
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:40,900
- How you fixed, Al?
- All right, Pa.

1497
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:47,300
Now, Ma.

1498
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,600
- Bye.
- Good-bye, hon.

1499
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:57,800
Bye-bye.

1500
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:02,100
- Bye-bye!
- Good-bye.

1501
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:04,500
- Bye!
- Thanks a lot.

1502
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:08,000
- Bye. Bye.
- Thanks for everything.

1503
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:11,900
- Be careful now.
- Bye.

1504
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:14,100
- Be careful.
- Bye.

1505
02:06:16,700 --> 02:06:18,800
Be good. Be good.

1506
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:36,200
Twenty days' work.
Oh, boy!

1507
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:39,000
I'll be glad to get my hands
on some cotton.

1508
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:41,300
That's the kind of pickin'
I understand.

1509
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:45,700
Maybe. Maybe 20 days' work
and maybe no days' work.

1510
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,900
We ain't got it
till we get it.

1511
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
What's the matter, Ma,
you gettin' scared?

1512
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:54,700
Scared, huh!
I ain't never gonna be scared no more.

1513
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,900
I was, though.

1514
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
For a while, it looked
as though we was beat, good and beat.

1515
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,300
Looked like we didn't have nobody
in the whole wide world but enemies...

1516
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:07,500
like nobody
was friendly no more.

1517
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:10,800
Made me feel kind
of bad and scared too...

1518
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:13,400
like we was lost
and nobody cared.

1519
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:18,800
You are the one
that keeps us goin', Ma.

1520
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:21,800
I ain't no good no more,
and I know it.

1521
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:25,800
Seems like I spend all my time these days
thinkin' how it used to be...

1522
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:29,600
- Mm-hmm.
- Thinkin' of home.

1523
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:32,100
I ain't never gonna
see it no more.

1524
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:37,100
Well, Pa, a woman can change
better than a man.

1525
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:40,900
A man lives sorta,
well, in jerks.

1526
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Baby's born or somebody dies
and that's a jerk.

1527
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:48,200
He gets a farm or loses it
and that's a jerk.

1528
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:51,900
With a woman, it's all in one flow
like a stream...

1529
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:54,600
little eddies
and waterfalls...

1530
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:58,000
but the river,
it goes right on.

1531
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:00,300
A woman looks
at it that way.

1532
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:06,700
Well, maybe,
but we sure takin' a beatin'.

1533
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:10,500
I know. That's what
makes us tough.

1534
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,500
Rich fellas come up
and they die.

1535
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:18,000
Their kids ain't no good and they die out,
but we keep a-comin'.

1536
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:20,100
We're the people
that live.

1537
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:23,500
They can't wipe us out.
They can't lick us.

1538
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:27,700
And we'll go on forever, Pa,
'cause we're the people.
