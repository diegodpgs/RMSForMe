1
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,099
There you are.

2
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,516
I've been looking for you.

3
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,399
Have you seen my other shoe?

4
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,821
What?

5
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,161
What?

6
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,462
Why are you looking at me like that?

7
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,684
Go potty.

8
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,972
Scotty.

9
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,021
Come on, boy. Scotty.

10
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,275
Go potty, Scotty.

11
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,528
Don't look at me like that.

12
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,749
Yes?

13
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,708
Great way to start the day, right?

14
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,340
I think I'm gonna puke.

15
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,046
Mom said you went on a date last week.
How'd it go?

16
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,680
It was okay.

17
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,766
"Okay" as in you got laid?

18
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,054
Harry.
What?

19
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,722
She can't hear you.

20
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,858
Don't you wanna have sex,
like, ever again in your life?

21
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,941
Yes. I just don't think
that I'm the dating type.

22
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,991
Girls only wanna sleep with me
because they read my book in high school.

23
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,196
So?

24
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,111
So they're not interested in me.

25
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,746
They're interested
in some idea of me.

26
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:21,035
That's why you should keep working out.
That way, they'll want you for your body.

27
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,211
What does this thing
even do?

28
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,501
It turns you into a god.

29
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,260
Keep going.

30
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,470
Hey, I had a weird dream last night.

31
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,056
There was this girl and she was...

32
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,062
What'd she look like?

33
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,811
Just a normal girl.
Just a girl I made up.

34
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,060
Well, what happened?

35
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,149
She just talked to me.

36
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,901
That's depressing.

37
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,779
Actually, it was really nice.

38
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,871
Seriously? You don't even get laid
in your dreams? That's...

39
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,952
That's just sad.

40
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,125
Hey, how's the new book coming along?

41
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,966
I don't know. I get a good idea,
like why don't I write about my dad?

42
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:17,008
And then, bam, I start thinking
that it's the stupidest thing ever.

43
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,802
Who wants to read about,
"He was disappointed in me...

44
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,845
...blah, blah, blah"?

45
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,099
Also, I'm feeling ambivalent
about Scotty.

46
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,442
Yeah, he slobbers. He chews things.

47
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,275
He pees like a girl,
which makes me feel inadequate.

48
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,108
He needs to go outside a lot, breaks up
my day. That's why I'm not writing.

49
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,823
Do you think that's why you're not writing?

50
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,204
No.
Why do think you're not writing?

51
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,836
Can I have Bobby now?

52
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,916
Do you need Bobby now?
Yes.

53
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,719
Calvin...

54
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,631
...when's the last time
you saw a friend?

55
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,348
Harry. Yesterday.

56
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,887
No, no.
Someone other than your brother.

57
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,182
Uh, have you been giving Bobby
to your other patients?

58
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,101
No, Bobby is just for you.

59
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,737
Because he smells weird.
Calvin...

60
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,571
...when you were deciding to get Scotty,
what did we talk about?

61
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,987
What did you say your hopes were?
Do you remember?

62
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,077
That he would help me meet people.

63
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,368
A little louder, please?

64
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,413
That he would be
awesome and we'd take hikes and stuff.

65
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,457
And people would stop to pet him,
and I would meet them.

66
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,217
But Scotty gets scared
when people try to pet him.

67
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,549
Does that embarrass you?

68
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,016
No.
I wanna give you a writing assignment.

69
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,176
I can't write.
Okay.

70
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,600
This would just be for me.

71
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,981
I'd like you to write a page...

72
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,269
...about someone who sees Scotty
all slobbery and scared...

73
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,359
...and likes him anyway,
just the way he is.

74
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,945
You think you could
do that for me?

75
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,910
Can it be bad?

76
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,447
I'd like it to be very bad.

77
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,673
I first met Calvin
when he was 19 years old.

78
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,508
And he'd already been at the top...

79
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,300
...of The New York <i>Times</i> Best Seller list,
uh, for several months.

80
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,602
And I remember thinking:

81
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,600
"Who the fuck is this kid?

82
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,647
And, uh, how can I go back in time
and be him?"

83
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,398
A high-school dropout
with acne still on his chin...

84
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:42,365
...gave us what may very well become
a classic American novel.

85
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,701
Since then, of course,
we've all enjoyed his short stories...

86
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,585
...uh, including last year's novella,
Breakfast for <i>Dinner.</i>

87
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,455
But it was only when I sat down
and reread his novel...

88
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:57,968
...now available in a beautiful
10th anniversary edition...

89
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:03,633
...that, uh, I realized just how
good a writer Calvin Weir-Fields is.

90
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,302
We are lucky to have him around.

91
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,311
Ladies and gentlemen,
Calvin Weir-Fields.

92
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,450
Phenomenal, man. Just brilliant.
Thank you. Thanks.

93
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,994
Brilliant.
Thanks so much.

94
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,286
Calvin.
Hi.

95
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,876
You know that chapter where
Charlie goes to the whorehouse?

96
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,794
Did you dress the whores blue because
it's the color of his mother's apron?

97
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,132
I'm sorry...

98
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,592
How did you know
where to send your manuscript?

99
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,052
I looked it up.

100
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,558
Oh, of course.

101
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,514
Is it weird for you that you
used to be so successful?

102
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,445
There's the man.

103
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,735
Cyrus, you gotta remind me
about these things.

104
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,869
You have to check
your messages, buddy.

105
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,905
I would've worn something nicer.

106
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,495
No one cares what you're wearing.
You are a genius.

107
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,581
Don't use that word.

108
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,085
Mr. Perrotta, over here.

109
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,247
<i>- Calvin always had talent.</i>
- Over here.

110
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,382
<i>But that, unfortunately, is not enough.</i>

111
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,760
- Langdon, right here!
<i>- All I did, really...</i>

112
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,345
...was guide him in the right direction
and, uh, like, pass the baton.

113
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,392
Mabel.

114
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,598
What?

115
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,433
I'm Mabel.

116
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,439
Oh, do I know you?
No, no.

117
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,271
Do you want my number?

118
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,277
It's a one-off, that book.
Great.

119
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,030
It's the first album of an indie band.
Thank you.

120
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,034
It has that sort of
unselfconscious verve...

121
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,492
...that, um... That you don't, uh...

122
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,624
Then, of course, there's
the second album syndrome, which...

123
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,284
We don't talk about that.

124
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,580
Everyone loves this book,
but we wanna hear what you're doing now.

125
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:01,467
What matters is right now.
What are you working on? Are you...?

126
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,922
<i>They love you, then they throw you away.</i>

127
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,259
- I mean, if I'm gonna include anybody...
<i>- It's actually easier...</i>

128
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,175
<i>...if you've only ever been mediocre.</i>

129
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,970
<i>If you've been at the top...</i>

130
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,558
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi.

131
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,314
<i>...it can kill you.</i>

132
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,693
Yeah, Salinger
had the right idea. He...

133
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,823
Write what you can, then,
pssh, disappear, you know?

134
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,906
So I've had a drink.

135
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,413
But no coke. I didn't...
No coke.

136
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,165
I didn't do any coke.

137
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,053
Scotty?

138
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,519
Scotty?

139
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,850
Sorry I'm late, buddy.

140
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,896
Scotty?

141
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,028
Scotty, what the fuck?

142
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,073
Oh.

143
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,553
<i>She's so cute.</i>

144
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,972
What?

145
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,813
Your dog. She's so cute.

146
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,897
Oh, he's a boy dog.

147
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,398
He just peed like a girl.

148
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,409
Have we met before?

149
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,536
I don't think so.

150
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,539
Do you mind if I draw him?

151
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,541
Uh, but don't get too close.

152
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,919
He's a little scared of people.

153
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,890
You're an artist?
Yeah.

154
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,426
I'm super good.
Really?

155
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,516
What's your dog's name?

156
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,931
Uh, Scotty.

157
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,644
Are you Scottish?
No.

158
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,777
I named him for F. Scott Fitzgerald.

159
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,656
Who?
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

160
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,442
The novelist.

161
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,452
<i>Great Gatsby.</i>

162
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,997
I don't read a lot of fiction.

163
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,625
You've never heard of
F. Scott Fitzgerald?

164
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,627
Why? Is he really famous
and important?

165
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,507
Well, he's probably one of the greatest
novelists who ever lived.

166
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,259
Isn't that disrespectful?

167
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,465
What?

168
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,511
Naming your dog after him?
It's a little disrespectful.

169
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,643
No, it's a gesture.
Yeah, an aggressive gesture.

170
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,146
Think about it. You're a novelist.
You think this guy's the greatest.

171
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,275
So you name your dog after him
to cut him down to size.

172
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,443
This way,
you can put him on a leash...

173
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,275
...and yell "Bad Scotty"...

174
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,611
...and feel all superior
because you pee inside.

175
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,324
Kill your idols, man.
I'm all for it.

176
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,500
All right. Scotty.

177
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,831
Hang on.

178
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,335
This is beautiful.
Yeah.

179
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,472
Your dog might pee like a lady,
but I like him anyway.

180
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,882
Hey, what did you just say?

181
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,473
I like him just the way he is.

182
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,314
Yes.

183
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:50,821
Yes. Yes.

184
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,356
"... Pooled into his eyes as though...
Rushed back like blood...

185
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,192
Calvin flushed with..."

186
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,395
You're a genius.

187
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,564
I thought we weren't gonna use that word.

188
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,860
You are really, really super fucking smart.
"I'd like it to be bad."

189
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,620
I'm glad you found something
that inspires you.

190
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,325
Inspires me?

191
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,784
It overwhelms me.
I literally cannot sleep or eat.

192
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,418
All I want I do is write.

193
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,423
I mean, I almost didn't come here today
because I didn't wanna be away from her.

194
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,499
Oh, God.
What?

195
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,296
Oh, my God.
Oh, I can't say it out loud.

196
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,215
It's too stupid.
I love it when you say stupid things.

197
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:04,932
Oh, no, this is really profoundly stupid.
Okay.

198
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,180
Ugh.

199
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,315
Okay, so the guy I'm writing...

200
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,942
Yeah, what's his name?

201
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,352
Uh, Calvin.

202
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:18,362
I'm gonna change it.
Uh, anyway, there's a lot of me in him.

203
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,786
What I'm trying to say <i>is...</i>

204
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,955
...it's almost like I'm writing
to spend time with her.

205
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,787
Who?
The girl.

206
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,953
The one I'm writing. It's...
I go to sleep at night...

207
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,963
...just waiting to get to my typewriter
so I can be with her.

208
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,797
It's like...
It's like I'm falling in love with her.

209
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,803
That's wonderful.
I can't fall in love with a girl I write.

210
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,714
Why not?
Because she's not real.

211
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,975
Isn't she? Are you sure?
No. Yes.

212
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,886
She's some motherfucking product
of my imagination!

213
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,563
Oh, Lila treated me so badly.
I know.

214
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,693
Who leaves someone after
their father dies?

215
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,775
Someone who couldn't
love you properly.

216
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,817
Someone who is a heartless slut.
Okay.

217
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,325
Well, tell me about her.
I don't wanna talk about Lila any more.

218
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,617
Well, I meant this girl that you're writing.
Tell me about her.

219
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,831
Ruby.

220
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,295
Ruby Sparks.

221
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,926
<i>Twenty-six years old.
Raised in Dayton, Ohio.</i>

222
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,139
<i>- Why Dayton?
- Sounds romantic.</i>

223
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,346
<i>Ruby's first crushes were
Humphrey Bogart and John Lennon.</i>

224
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,012
Cried the day she found out
they were already dead.

225
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,725
<i>Ruby got kicked out of high school
for sleeping with her art teacher...</i>

226
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,861
...or maybe her Spanish teacher.
I haven't decided yet.

227
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,486
<i>Ruby can't drive.
She doesn't own a computer.</i>

228
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,445
<i>She hates her middle name,
which is Tiffany.</i>

229
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,534
She always, always roots
for the underdog.

230
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,292
She's complicated.
That's what I like best about her.

231
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,878
<i>Ruby's not so good at life sometimes.</i>

232
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,540
<i>She forgets to open bills
or cash checks and...</i>

233
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,714
<i>Her last boyfriend was 49.</i>

234
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,380
<i>The one before that was an alcoholic.</i>

235
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:08,431
She can feel a change coming.
She's looking for it.

236
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,220
Looking for what?

237
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,481
<i>Something new.</i>

238
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,399
Feels good, right?
Can we stop a second?

239
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,360
Why? You all right?

240
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,567
- Hey, Sue.
- Yeah?

241
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,532
They didn't have paprika,
so I got cumin.

242
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,287
Shh, shh!
They're the same thing, right?

243
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,494
Miles went down.
If you wake him, I will beat you.

244
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,581
Calvin? You need to thank me
because I cleaned your oven.

245
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,370
Thank you, Susie.
Oh, my woman.

246
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,085
Okay. You're sweaty.
Get your mitts off of me.

247
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,363
Susie, did you happen to sha...?
You didn't tell me you were getting laid.

248
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,614
Harry.
I'm just saying.

249
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,652
He claims to be writing too much
to haul his ass to our house.

250
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,320
But turns out,
he's just getting too much poon.

251
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,411
Harry, I swear to God...
I'm not getting any poon.

252
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,325
Ch, yeah?

253
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,953
Whose is that?
You tell me.

254
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,207
Oh, my God. Scotty.

255
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,963
- It's Scotty's?
- No. Scotty...

256
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,253
Don't let the baby touch that.
Miles, don't...

257
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,889
- Suse, he likes it.
- No, he doesn't like it.

258
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,550
Scotty's been dragging them in.
He seems to love it.

259
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,810
He goes through
my weird neighbor's garbage.

260
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,267
- So that's a random dirty bra?
- It's dirty.

261
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,976
That's gross.
You made him cough.

262
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,609
Calvin, don't put it away.
Throw it away.

263
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,065
I swear, if your mother knew...

264
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,321
- Calvin, what is this?
- What's what?

265
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,653
Nothing.
Harry, get over here.

266
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,659
Uh, please, don't.

267
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,366
Are these panties?
Fuck off.

268
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,497
I swear,
Scotty's been dragging them in.

269
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,908
Right. Scotty.
Shut up.

270
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,499
Calvin, throw these away.

271
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,426
- Hey, Susie, I'm gonna check on Harry.
- Okay.

272
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,684
- Tell him we have to go soon.
- Okay.

273
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,620
So?

274
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,698
Where do you see this going?

275
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,747
Well, I don't know. I just started.

276
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,879
This is a love story, right?

277
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,211
Who reads love stories?

278
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,875
Women.

279
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,921
And I'm telling you,
no woman's gonna wanna read this.

280
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,212
Why not? It's romantic.

281
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,555
Quirky, messy women whose problems
only make them endearing are not real.

282
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,352
Period.

283
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,014
What do they say,
"write what you've been through"?

284
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,809
Write what you know.
Exactly. Write what you know.

285
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,648
I've known girls like Ruby.
Yeah?

286
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,187
Who?

287
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,942
Girls.

288
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,528
Lila?
Not fucking Lila.

289
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,864
You've had one relationship.
For five years.

290
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,246
You never even lived together.

291
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,333
I'm telling you, Calvin,
the honeymoon shit, it doesn't last.

292
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,746
I know that.
Women are different up close.

293
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,585
I love Susie...

294
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,712
...but she's a weirdo.

295
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:31,129
Sometimes, she's mean as fuck
for no reason.

296
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,547
She's a person.

297
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,593
You haven't written a person, okay?

298
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,183
You've written a girl.
All right, whatever.

299
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,815
Writers don't show their work
to people at this stage.

300
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,941
I might not even finish it.

301
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,895
Because...
And don't, like, tell people about it.

302
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,445
Listen. I'm not saying you can't write.

303
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,743
I'm saying...

304
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,406
...you don't know jack shit
about women.

305
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,796
Don't let those leftovers go to waste,
okay, skinny?

306
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,089
Gym tomorrow?

307
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,251
Uh, I'm seeing Cyrus.

308
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,137
Maybe Friday?
Friday.

309
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,298
- I know.
- You okay, bud?

310
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,716
Yes.

311
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,335
<i>This thing is dripping everywhere</i>

312
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,672
<i>How are you supposed to eat this thing?</i>

313
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,767
What?

314
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,317
You're so not my type.

315
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,688
What do you mean I'm not your type?

316
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:18,824
I usually go for guys
who are a little more, um, assertive.

317
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,114
I'm assertive.
Ha, ha. No.

318
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,659
You're stubborn. That's different.

319
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,542
<i>I had this one boyfriend...</i>

320
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,752
<i>...who told me I wasn't funny...</i>

321
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,009
<i>...but that I have a good sense
of humor...</i>

322
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,670
<i>...because I laughed at his jokes.</i>

323
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,180
Why would you date a guy like that?

324
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,183
I was young.
You must have things you regret.

325
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,594
Not really.

326
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,354
Everything's been perfect so far.
Oh.

327
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,563
So that's what you're looking for
in a guy?

328
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,739
Douchiness?

329
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,078
<i>I don't know.</i>

330
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,831
I guess I was looking for you.

331
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,254
It just took me a while
to find you.

332
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,008
Ruby.
Jump!

333
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,649
<i>What did you think
the first time you saw me?</i>

334
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:38,112
<i>I thought you were
the most beautiful girl I ever saw.</i>

335
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,277
<i>Were you disappointed
when you got to know me?</i>

336
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,616
<i>How can you ask that?</i>

337
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,156
<i>I'm such a mess.</i>

338
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,996
<i>I love your mess</i>

339
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,750
<i>The first time I saw you, I thought:</i>

340
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,539
<i>"Look at that boy.</i>

341
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:59,463
<i>I'm going to love him
forever and ever and ever."</i>

342
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,472
<i>- What if you get sick of me?</i>
<i>- I won't.</i>

343
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,805
<i>I promise.</i>

344
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,935
Hello. Shit.

345
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,156
Shit.

346
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,662
Hello. Damn it.

347
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,083
Okay. No.

348
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,584
<i>Hello.</i>
Cyrus.

349
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,293
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>
Uh, sorry.

350
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,754
I was writing, I fell asleep.
I'll be right there.

351
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,591
<i>Look, if you aren't ready
to talk about this, it's fine.</i>

352
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,847
No... No, no.
I wanna show you what I have.

353
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,007
I think you're gonna be really excited.

354
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,348
<i>Of course, I'll be excited. Okay, uh,
here's what I'll do. I'll push my lunch.</i>

355
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:53,311
Okay. All right. Well, uh, if I leave now,
I should be there in 15 minutes.

356
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,647
<i>All right.</i>
If there isn't any traffic.

357
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,231
Oh, damn it. Scotty.

358
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,488
<i>What?</i>
Uh, nothing. Uh, my dog has to pee.

359
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,025
- I'll, uh, put him in the backyard.
- I'll take him out.

360
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,285
- Great. Thank you.
<i>- Cal?</i>

361
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,908
<i>Cal?</i>

362
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,701
<i>Hello?</i>

363
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,041
I missed you in bed last night.

364
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,086
- Did you get some good writing done?
<i>- Are you there?</i>

365
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,871
- Oh, God.
- Hey, you want a bite?

366
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,336
- It's Crispix.
<i>- I think I lost him.</i>

367
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,845
God, it's happening.
It's really happening this time.

368
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,298
They're gonna hospitalize me.
What's wrong?

369
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,469
They all thought I was so smart,
but it turns out I was just batshit.

370
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,888
Calvin?
What the fuck?

371
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,056
Calvin.

372
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,942
It's not real. It's not real.

373
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,606
It's not real.

374
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:45,822
Okay, you're dreaming.

375
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,362
You're dreaming.

376
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,121
You're dreaming...

377
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,034
...and you're going to wake <i>up...</i>

378
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,249
...right now.

379
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,771
Oh, shit.

380
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,571
- Calvin? Are you mad at me?
- Oh.

381
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,360
Oh, God. It's not real.

382
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,451
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real.

383
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,283
Doctor...

384
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,927
Hi, Dr. Rosenthal. It's Calvin Weir-Fields.
Something has come up...

385
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:49,465
...and I'd appreciate it if you called me
as soon as possible. Thank you.

386
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,817
Hey
Ruby?

387
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,732
Um...

388
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:13,410
I thought you might be hungry,
so I'm making you some eggs.

389
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,788
Mm.

390
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,581
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.

391
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,420
Nothing, uh...

392
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,337
Are these, by any chance, yours?

393
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:30,097
Yeah, of course, they are.

394
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,012
Who else would they belong to?

395
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,306
Oh, my God.

396
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,147
Are you seeing someone else?
Oh, no.

397
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,979
No, no, no, I'm not...

398
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,771
I'm not seeing anyone
other than you.

399
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,903
Will you excuse me?

400
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,408
Remember how Dad used
to say I had an overactive imagination?

401
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,823
<i>Are you saying Ruby is in your house?</i>

402
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,457
I started seeing her this morning.

403
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,211
It's like that movie Harvey,
except she's not a giant rabbit.

404
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,668
It's not like she knows
she's imaginary, either.

405
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,334
She thinks we're in the relationship
in my book.

406
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,049
<i>It is freaking me out.</i>

407
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,424
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
But this is an emergency.

408
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,057
I may be losing my mind.

409
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,054
Just give me one sec. Just...
<i>Harry. Harry.</i>

410
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,598
There's no possible way
that Ruby's in your house...

411
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,482
...because she's not a real person.

412
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,566
I know objectively she is not real,
but I'm telling you...

413
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,822
<i>...I can see her, I can smell her.</i>

414
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,733
When she touched me, I could feel it.

415
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,244
She's making eggs in my kitchen.
Actual eggs.

416
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,655
That's great.

417
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:39,746
Calvin, I am at work. I'm in
the middle of a very important meeting.

418
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,751
I cannot deal with your shit right now.

419
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,834
<i>Listen to me.
I want you to leave the house...</i>

420
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,921
<i>...see a friend. A friend
who can't see your imaginary friend.</i>

421
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,303
If this is still an issue tonight,
we'll talk, okay?

422
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:55,091
Okay. I'll phone a friend.

423
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,926
Sorry about that, I was...

424
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,187
Kobe's having a barbecue this weekend.
You got plans this weekend?

425
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,938
It's Calvin.

426
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,600
Weir-Fields. From high school.

427
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,111
Yeah, the writer.

428
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,648
I sat next to you in Spanish class.

429
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,407
Uh, actually, I gotta go.

430
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,778
Where are you going?

431
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,821
Out.
Where?

432
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,860
To the store.

433
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,787
What for?

434
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,074
To get some stuff.

435
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,084
Can I come?
No.

436
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,167
Why not?
Because.

437
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,548
Please?
No.

438
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,089
Please?

439
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,069
<i>...point-nine KCRW.</i>

440
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,074
<i>Up next, tickets for KCRW members.</i>

441
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,282
<i>If you haven't won anything from us
in the last 90 days...</i>

442
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,119
I hear they're doing
a zombie film festival at the cemetery.

443
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:48,459
You wanna go? We could do a shot
every time someone gets bitten.

444
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,964
Okay. Bye.

445
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,625
Bye? Where are you going?

446
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,509
Nowhere.

447
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,214
Café Figaro. I've got this friend.
It won't take long.

448
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,927
What am I supposed to do?

449
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,311
Stay here. Enjoy the shops.

450
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,563
I'll be back soon.

451
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,441
When I didn't hear from you
right away...

452
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,103
...I figured you had lost my number
or something.

453
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,315
At least that's what my roommate said
must have happened.

454
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,323
Oh, no, I didn't lose your number.
Uh, actually the, uh, night I met you...

455
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,705
...I started writing something,
so that's been really consuming.

456
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,081
The night you met me?

457
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,083
Am I...?

458
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,745
Never mind. Ha, ha. Never mind.

459
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,709
Um, am I in it?

460
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,712
I can't really talk about it.
Right, of course.

461
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:39,255
But if I am, like, when it comes out
in stores and stuff...

462
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,220
...will you tell me which character I am?
You're not in it.

463
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,430
Right, but if I am?

464
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,682
I will let you know.

465
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,189
Okay. Awesome. Awesome.

466
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,988
So, um, do you do this a lot?

467
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,741
Do what?
Meet up in the middle of the day for sex.

468
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,620
No. No, that's not...
I just wanted someone to talk to.

469
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,905
Oh.

470
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,996
Right. Right.

471
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,911
Well, men never
just wanna talk to women.

472
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,456
I do.
If you say so.

473
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,966
Uh, heh, are you even legal?

474
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:20,220
I mean, not to drink, but, yeah.

475
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,473
Of course. Do you, um...?

476
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,307
Do you wanna go someplace?

477
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,846
Hi.
Sorry, what?

478
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,559
Do you wanna go to my place?

479
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,315
Hi.
Sorry.

480
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,817
I'm sorry.
What's going on?

481
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,398
Am I interrupting?
I thought I heard something.

482
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,818
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- Calvin.

483
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,360
Do you know this girl?
Yeah. Hi, I'm Ruby, Calvin's girlfriend.

484
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,653
I don't think we've met.

485
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,830
Uh, no.

486
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,492
Um, I'm Mabel. I was just going.

487
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,753
You can see her?
Yeah, she can see me.

488
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,163
I can see her.

489
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,173
You can see her.
Let's not make this worse, all right?

490
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,835
Sorry, I didn't know.
Did Harry put you up to this?

491
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,003
What, your brother is in on this?
What?

492
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,094
Ruby, it was very nice meeting you.
Calvin, have fun writing.

493
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,183
Who the fuck was that?

494
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,185
Can you see her?
Calvin, who was that?

495
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,893
Can I see her?
Can he see me? What are you...? Stop.

496
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,477
What's wrong with you, man?

497
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:16,981
She's real.

498
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,488
Oh, no. Ruby!

499
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,484
Ruby! Ruby.

500
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,152
Get away from me!
Ruby! Ruby!

501
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,616
Get away! Get away!
Ruby!

502
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,536
Ruby, please, listen to me.
Let go!

503
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,450
Stop!
Listen to me. Calm down. Ruby.

504
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,209
- Get away from me!
- Hey, you okay?

505
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,915
You want me to call the police?

506
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,332
No. Thank you.
He's just being a complete asshole.

507
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,715
Are you sure?

508
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,214
Yeah.

509
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,425
Thank you, I'm fine.

510
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,176
Ruby.
You stay away.

511
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:53,018
God, I should have known. You've been
acting like such a freak... Stop!

512
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,477
Let go of me!

513
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,686
Put me down!

514
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,396
Put me down or I'm gonna scream!

515
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,560
Ruby,
Stop it!

516
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,900
Put me down!
Ruby?

517
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,564
Oh. My God, stop! Ow!

518
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,575
Shh! Stop it. Oh, do not bite.
Do not bite.

519
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,361
Listen to me. Shh, shh.

520
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,246
There is a lot that is new here,
more than I can tell you.

521
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,407
I'm having trouble processing it all,
okay?

522
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,292
Then talk to me about it.

523
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,249
Don't go on a date with another girl.

524
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,254
I wasn't on a date.

525
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:22,092
What is going on with you?
I don't know. I'm sorry.

526
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,431
Oh, I'm just having trouble...

527
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,968
...wrapping my head
around the reality of this situation.

528
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,520
That you're here.

529
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,312
That you're real.

530
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,443
It all seems pretty incredible.

531
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,404
What?

532
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,371
Kiss me, stupid.

533
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,633
Holy shit.

534
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,735
Mm.

535
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:53,910
Look, I know it's a lot to take in,
but you have to believe me.

536
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,161
She's real.

537
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,869
I don't know how or why...

538
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:02,252
...but she's here and she's real.

539
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,957
And I like it.

540
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,921
"Real" as in other people can see her.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

541
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,054
We've been to restaurants.
We take Scotty for walks in the park.

542
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:18,515
People talk to her. She's very friendly.
That's impossible.

543
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,021
It's apparently not.

544
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,314
What does Dr. Rosenthal say?

545
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,535
Are you fucking serious?

546
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,288
People have shrinks
for when they start seeing things.

547
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,538
I'm not seeing things.

548
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,951
Calvin, call him.
I can't.

549
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,787
I told him when she was a character.
He won't understand.

550
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,423
Call him or I'm telling Mom.
He'll think I'm crazy.

551
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,083
You might be crazy.

552
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,469
The situation is crazy.

553
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,049
I am not.

554
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,298
Do you hear...? Hi.

555
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,718
Do you hear yourself? Do you?
Do you hear yourself? Really?

556
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:05,315
There's no way that you're sleeping
with a girl that you made up.

557
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,991
Hey, so, uh, she doesn't know
that I wrote her...

558
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,576
...so don't say anything
about the manuscript, okay?

559
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,537
Yeah, okay.

560
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,003
Hi, Ruby. Great to meet you.
Can we call the doctor now?

561
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,505
- Harry.
- Calvin!

562
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,210
Oof! Hey.

563
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,216
What took you so long?

564
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,254
Hey, Ruby, this is my brother, Harry.
Hey.

565
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,969
Harry. Hi.
Hi.

566
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,429
Hi. It's great to meet you.
Hi.

567
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,894
I've heard so much about you
from Calvin.

568
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,726
You're Ruby.

569
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,266
You're Harry.

570
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,981
The painter from Dayton, Ohio.

571
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,362
Yep.
Yep.

572
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,739
Are you staying for supper?
I'm making meat loaf.

573
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,196
She's an amazing cook.

574
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,696
Yeah. Can I talk to you a second?
Outside?

575
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,159
Okay.

576
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,834
What did you do? Hire some actress?
Craigslist? This isn't funny.

577
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,468
I told you, she just appeared.

578
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,880
You're a writer, not Ricky Jay.
I know that.

579
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:21,346
There's gotta be some logical explanation.
Love isn't logical.

580
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,886
No, but you know what is?
Physics. Or metaphysics.

581
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,225
People don't appear out of thin air.
She did.

582
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,559
How?
I don't know how.

583
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,565
It's love. It's magic.

584
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,317
Okay.
What are you doing?

585
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,819
Calling your doctor.
Don't.

586
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,524
Harry. Harry.
Give me that.

587
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,736
We might... Give me the phone.
Harry, listen to me, please.

588
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,327
Remember what you told me
when you met Susie?

589
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:44,410
I certainly didn't pretend I invented her.
You said that she was your dream girl.

590
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,574
That's what happened to me.
Heh-heh-heh.

591
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,038
Harry, don't laugh at me.

592
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,624
Has it occurred to you
that she might be an imposter?

593
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,542
Some girl wanted to get close to you,
somehow got her hands on what you wrote.

594
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,755
You're the only one
who's read my manuscript.

595
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,717
So unless you're playing some joke...
Okay, okay, okay.

596
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,474
Let's say you created this person.
Everything you wrote about her came true.

597
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,261
Even the smallest things?
Yes.

598
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,727
Have you tried writing more?
No.

599
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,941
Write something about her.

600
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,106
Why? She's perfect.

601
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,442
Write something about her,
see if it comes true.

602
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,403
If it does, then you're right
and this is a fucking miracle.

603
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:20,783
And if nothing happens...

604
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,788
...maybe we go to the police.

605
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,038
Don't call...
Just go in there and act normal. Go up.

606
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,376
You act normal.
I'm not gonna say...

607
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:51,060
We're gonna go upstairs
and check on something, uh, online.

608
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,316
Were you guys
getting stoned out there?

609
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,945
Okay, here's where I left off.

610
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,868
It has to be something
we notice right away, okay?

611
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,158
Something obvious.

612
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,503
What she's wearing?
Yes. Yes.

613
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,163
What she's wearing.

614
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,508
What was she wearing?

615
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,927
Was it pink?

616
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,515
I got it.

617
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,013
Okay. Okay.

618
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,104
Write that she speaks fluent French.

619
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,018
Yeah, just put it down.

620
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,359
I'll do it.
I... Shh.

621
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,373
I'll be right back. I have to do something.
No, wait, hold it.

622
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,717
Calvin.

623
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,638
Bottle of vino.

624
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:59,938
Great. Your brother looks like
he could use a drink.

625
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,904
I have to say,
that's the best meat loaf I've ever had.

626
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,446
Thank you.

627
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,955
It's a family recipe.

628
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,412
I can't really take credit.

629
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,704
So your... Your family's in Ohio?

630
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:22,712
Yeah. Actually, my parents died
when I was a baby in an accident...

631
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,717
...and I got moved around a lot.

632
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,128
I guess the habit stuck.

633
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,969
I've lived in nine cities
in six years, so... Nine?

634
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:33,305
Yeah.
Wow, that's a lot of cities.

635
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,142
I'm so sorry. I'm totally
monopolizing this conversation.

636
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,398
No. This is fascinating.

637
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,558
Please, keep going. Please.

638
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,319
What nice boys.

639
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:47,278
Your mom must be so proud.
It's hard to raise a decent guy.

640
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,785
Oh, I think a person would have to do
something pretty amazing...

641
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,445
...to produce a good woman.

642
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,205
Okay. Great.

643
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,742
Uh, you guys like each other.
I think Harry has to go now.

644
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,001
Right, buddy?

645
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,084
He can be such a control freak, right?

646
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,383
- I'll be right back.
- Good night.

647
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,091
See you soon, I hope.
Hey. So?

648
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,347
Get in the car.
What?

649
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,762
Get in the car.
Why? What...?

650
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,024
That was insane!

651
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,273
Harry...
This is insane.

652
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,187
You manifested a woman with your mind.

653
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,407
Mom's gonna fucking freak.
Whoa, you can't tell Mom.

654
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,159
Why not? She loves all this New Age shit.
Seriously...

655
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,197
...you can't tell anybody.
Not Mom, not Susie. No one.

656
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,537
This is amazing. How can I not tell?
They'll think she's a freak.

657
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,545
We're gonna pretend she's your girlfriend?
She is my girlfriend.

658
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,090
Seriously?

659
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,251
Why not?
Your girlfriend.

660
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,715
Stranger things have happened.
I don't think so.

661
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:55,976
I think this is pretty much the strangest
thing that's ever happened, ever.

662
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,977
You gonna marry her?
Have kids with her?

663
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,060
I don't know.
But wouldn't that be like incest?

664
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,475
Or mind-cest?
I don't care.

665
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,981
I love her.

666
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,070
Please don't ruin this for me.

667
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,527
Promise me, no one.

668
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,532
Fine.

669
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,196
Thank you.

670
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:24,288
Oh, hey, so you can,
like, change her.

671
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,589
I guess.

672
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:35,306
You could, like, tweak things
if you wanted.

673
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,683
Tweak? What do you mean?

674
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,391
I don't know, like anything.
Big tits, long legs...

675
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:43,602
I like her little legs.
Know how many times I wanted a button...

676
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,483
...to make Susie stop doing
all the annoying shit she does?

677
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,441
I mean, you could get blowjobs
whenever you wanted.

678
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:50,947
Ruby loves giving blow jobs.

679
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,403
Now, but what about
in a couple months or days?

680
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,365
Women are mysterious creatures.
I still look at Susie like:

681
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,279
"Who are you? Who are you?"

682
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:01,450
I know Ruby, Harry. I wrote her.

683
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,960
So you can make her,
like, do anything.

684
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,836
For men everywhere...

685
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,594
...tell me you're not gonna
let that go to waste.

686
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,808
I will never write about her again.

687
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,315
Calvin?

688
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,650
Hey.

689
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,489
So did he like me?

690
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,867
He loved you.

691
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,450
Stop, stop, stop.

692
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,738
Hey, if it's my mom, please don't...

693
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,077
<i>Hello?</i>

694
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,742
<i>Hello, is anyone there? I don't...</i>

695
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,035
Hi, Mom.

696
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,832
<i>Oh, hi, sweetie. Hi.
I wasn't sure you were there.</i>

697
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,625
What do you want, Mom?

698
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,465
<i>I was wondering if
you're gonna make it up this weekend.</i>

699
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,221
I told you we can't this weekend.
We're busy.

700
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,007
<i>- Oh, with what?</i>
<i>- Busy with what?</i>

701
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,392
<i>Your brother says
you haven't been writing.</i>

702
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,179
<i>He doesn't know.
You've been with this girl for months.</i>

703
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,474
<i>I haven't even met her.
I'm beginning to think she doesn't exist.</i>

704
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,768
What? No. I mean, yes.

705
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,403
<i>So when can I meet her?</i>
Soon.

706
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,406
<i>Next weekend?
Harry and Susie will be here.</i>

707
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:58,566
<i>Come on, please?</i>

708
00:46:58,733 --> 00:46:59,859
Look, we have plans.

709
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,404
I'm gonna call you later, okay?
I'm driving.

710
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,581
Why can't we go to Big Sur?

711
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,244
Uh, well, we'd have to find someone
to watch Scotty.

712
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,912
We could take him with us.

713
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,955
I don't know. Mort...

714
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,874
Their house is weird.

715
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,418
You don't want me
to meet your mom.

716
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,757
Of course,
I want you to meet my mom.

717
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,388
I'll invite her down for Christmas, okay?

718
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:29,807
Hey, you know that coffee shop
on Dwyer? The new one?

719
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,599
Yes.

720
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,563
I was thinking maybe
I could try to get a job there.

721
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:40,116
Well, I told you, I'm happy
to support you while you paint.

722
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,195
Honey, I'm sort of tired.

723
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,614
Okay.

724
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,783
Let's turn out the light, then.

725
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:02,259
It's just, maybe if I wasn't around,
you could get more writing done.

726
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,470
Weren't you working on something
when we first met?

727
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,145
Calvin?

728
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,283
What are you doing?

729
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,696
Just packing for Big Sur.

730
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,581
Really?

731
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,162
Yeah.

732
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,377
Wow, look at this place.

733
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,089
All right, this is it.

734
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,379
You asked for it.

735
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,923
You have nothing
to worry about.

736
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,475
Look, why don't we stay
somewhere else tonight?

737
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,399
Just you and me. There's a thousand
bed-and-breakfasts around.

738
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,061
Honey, it's gonna be great.
It could be romantic.

739
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,321
Finally.
Hi.

740
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,027
You're here!
Hi.

741
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,237
Hi.
Hi.

742
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,571
Okay.
Hi, Scotty.

743
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:49,783
- Hi. Come on. Come on, Scotty.
- Okay.

744
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,197
Hi.
Hello. Hi.

745
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,990
Hi. I'm Ruby.
Hi, Ruby.

746
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,500
Hi.

747
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:58,629
Wow, your garden is so amazing.

748
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,381
All the plants have medicinal purposes.

749
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,089
- Medicinal.
- Yeah.

750
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,549
That is very cool.

751
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,220
Whoa.

752
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,306
This is incredible.
Yeah.

753
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:17,019
He started it in 1980
and he just keeps adding to it.

754
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,229
It's his masterpiece.

755
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,938
Mort built all of this?
Yeah.

756
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,945
Can you believe it?
Yes, I can.

757
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:28,447
And this is where we live.

758
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,612
Oh, my God.

759
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,406
This is so beautiful.

760
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,995
Wow.

761
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,707
I feel like I'm in some kind of temple.

762
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:43,500
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you said that.

763
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:47,091
Calvin, she is so intuitive.
What? What? What?

764
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,382
Mort got this wood from Amish land.
It was blessed.

765
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,802
And the bricks come from an old
Catholic school that was torn down.

766
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:55,345
That's incredible.

767
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,513
Stairway, bedroom.

768
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,808
That's where Harry will sleep.

769
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,976
This is my study. Don't go in there.

770
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,645
I'm re-alphabetizing.

771
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,525
And this is where you'll be sleeping.

772
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,868
Oh, it's like a little nest.

773
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,122
Uh, Mom, we're in here?
There are no doors.

774
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,784
No one's interested
in your business, honey.

775
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,704
Well, this is the bathroom.

776
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,497
We have our own well.

777
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,797
This is Mort's workshop!

778
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,719
He makes driftwood furniture!

779
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,303
Mort!

780
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,266
Mort, honey, they're here!

781
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,181
Hey!

782
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,141
Welcome!

783
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,859
That's a good boy, good boy.

784
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,988
He is such a good boy.
So, Ruby...

785
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,989
...did you go to art school?

786
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:50,650
No, I didn't train formally.

787
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,944
I just sort of picked things up
here and there.

788
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,740
That's right. Just do it.
You learn more that way, eh?

789
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,873
I mean, look at Calvin, eh?

790
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,411
Right, <i>hijo mío?</i> Ha-ha-ha.

791
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,875
Um, Mort, could you
not feed Scotty?

792
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,541
Aw, don't worry. He loves it.
It'll upset his stomach.

793
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,335
Dogs love human food.
They do.

794
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,128
- No, they don't.
- They do.

795
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,842
I painted when I was young.

796
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,302
Did you?
Yeah.

797
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,388
Calvin never told me.

798
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,268
Well, their father didn't approve.

799
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:19,895
Because she painted porn.

800
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,806
Nudes.
In positions.

801
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,440
It was basically porn.

802
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,398
I think they are very sexy, Harry.

803
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,734
Mort's been encouraging me
to take it up again.

804
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,195
You should do it, Mama.
You're very good at it.

805
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:33,951
Lovey.

806
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,362
- You're good at everything.
- Lovey.

807
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,996
Everything is so good, Mama.

808
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,207
- Oh, sweetie.
- So good.

809
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,618
- Okay.
- Let's go, let's go.

810
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,411
One minute left. One minute.

811
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,669
First word!

812
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,954
A little word.
No, big word.

813
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,919
Uh, if. It's.
Uh, and.

814
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,174
It's.
Uh, the, the, the.

815
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,085
Well, uh...
What.

816
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:52,966
What.
What?

817
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,254
What.

818
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,095
What.

819
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,009
Thank you, Mort.
You're on our team.

820
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,723
Second word.
You're on our team.

821
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,891
- Uh, redwoods.
- They're not gonna get it.

822
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,434
You and me. Not them. Us.
Us.

823
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,647
- We, uh...
- Us.

824
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,936
A girl's, uh...

825
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,276
The T's and butt, um...
Ugh!

826
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,906
Babies! Girls?
Oh, boy.

827
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,112
Women!
Women?

828
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,277
"What women."
Mort.

829
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,537
"What women."

830
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,039
<i>What Women Want?
What Women Want.</i>

831
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,955
Oh, they won!

832
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,371
<i>What Women Want? </i>Who picks that?
Come over here.

833
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,289
You're so good.
Mort? He picked it?

834
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,958
I love you. Oh, my God. You win the prize.

835
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,627
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

836
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,216
- I'm a traitor.
- But that was against the rules!

837
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,137
Calvin.

838
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,769
Calvin.

839
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,600
I forgot to tell you.

840
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:48,313
Your mom said that she was gonna
teach me how to bake a pie.

841
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:53,072
She says we can just go out in the garden
and pick the berries ourselves.

842
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,074
Isn't that amazing?

843
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:59,661
She didn't used to be like this.

844
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,576
Like what?

845
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:08,709
When Dad was around,
she wore polo shirts and cooked meat.

846
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,249
It's like she's been brainwashed.

847
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,170
I think she and Mort seem really happy.

848
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,306
- Ah!
- Calvin!

849
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:28,690
- Watch out!
- Come on!

850
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,352
- Come down here!
- Hey, Calvin!

851
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,029
Calvin! Calvin!

852
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,690
- Let's go!
- Watch out!

853
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:39,076
- The water's great, man, come on.
- It's beautiful!

854
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,360
No, thanks.

855
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:43,706
Oh, it's so fun.
You're missing out.

856
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,491
I promised Langdon
I'd finish his book.

857
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,993
Why don't you
come up here with me?

858
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,958
Okay, enjoy yourself!

859
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,497
Mort, be careful.

860
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,041
Asteroid!

861
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,174
Yeah!

862
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,715
- Yeah!
- That was beautiful.

863
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,891
Now do it with me. Do it with me.

864
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,317
Calvin, honey?

865
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,984
Are you okay?

866
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,904
Yeah. I'm fine.

867
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,368
Okay.

868
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,829
I'm really glad you brought her.

869
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,834
It means a lot to me.

870
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,997
Okay.

871
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,167
Dinner's in a half hour.

872
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,930
But, hey, Harry, Harry, Harry.

873
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:45,343
You wanna see my impression of Scotty?
Yeah.

874
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,270
That makes me laugh.

875
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,148
Wanna see my impression of Scotty
when he's really angry?

876
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,524
Yeah.

877
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,269
That's so wrong.

878
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:58,940
He's an intellectual.

879
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,614
Oh, that is good.

880
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,404
Uh, don't make fun of Scotty.

881
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,408
Oh, calm down.

882
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:12,454
- Hey, come on. Take it.
- Oh, my God. You look so cute here.

883
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,122
That was such a classic.
I told you I don't want it.

884
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:19,135
- You should try it. It's really mellow.
- It's all right. He doesn't need it.

885
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,258
His brain is big enough.
Yeah, no, it's big.

886
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,298
It's so big, he can...

887
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,343
Just with his thoughts, he can just...
He thinks it and:

888
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,054
- Harry?
- Just...

889
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,268
- Just...
- Honey, not here.

890
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:35,310
One thought.
I mean, he just can just, poof.

891
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,978
He just, poof.
Harry, I think you've had enough.

892
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,397
Oh.
Ha-ha-ha.

893
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:43,488
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about I love you.

894
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,995
- What?
- Yay, someone is ready for bed.

895
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,156
- Yeah, I'm definitely ready.
- Let's go.

896
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,791
Well, this was a great dinner.

897
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,496
Ooh!

898
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,253
Here, let me... Let me help you.
You know what, Mort?

899
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,835
I think you've done plenty.
Uh...

900
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,008
- Yeah. Good night.
- Great, great.

901
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,384
You okay?
Yeah, you okay?

902
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,011
- Go.
- I'm fine.

903
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,296
Big Sur, everybody.

904
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:08,184
- Come on, crazy.
- I love this place. Love you.

905
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:12,563
I think I'm gonna go inside
and, uh, talk to him.

906
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,314
Okay.

907
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,108
I'm sorry.

908
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,984
No, it's okay.

909
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,866
As long as I know
he isn't like this all the time.

910
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,286
He isn't.
Oh.

911
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,866
Good.

912
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,912
Ah.

913
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,090
Look.

914
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,884
- Is that you?
- Heh, yes.

915
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,670
Wow.
And that was Jack.

916
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,264
He's so handsome.

917
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:51,052
Yes, and very, very serious,
just like Calvin.

918
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,012
- He was a golfer?
- Ruby?

919
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,435
Wha...? Hey.
Ruby, bed.

920
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,644
Right now?
Yes.

921
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,730
Why won't you take it?

922
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,394
I want you to have it.

923
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,235
What's going on?
Calvin won't accept my present.

924
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,570
Why not?

925
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,656
- Mort works hard on his furniture.
- Yeah.

926
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:12,414
I call it the Lone Pine.
That's beautiful.

927
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:16,247
Don't you like it?
Of course he does. It's a great chair.

928
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,163
Come on, sit down, sit down.
Just feel the wood.

929
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,922
Calvin...

930
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,571
<i>Skinnamarinky dinky dink</i>

931
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,198
<i>Dinky do</i>

932
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,781
<i>I love you</i>

933
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,196
<i>Skinnamarinky dinky dink</i>

934
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,909
<i>Dinky do</i>

00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,791
<i>I love you</i>

936
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,461
<i>I love you in the morning
And in the afternoon</i>

937
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,293
Honey, I'm trying to read.

938
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,637
Ruby?

939
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,314
You read your stupid book
all weekend.

940
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,860
Your mom and Mort were trying so hard.

941
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,821
I'm sorry.

942
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,255
You don't have any friends.

943
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,003
I have you.

944
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,753
I don't need anyone else.

945
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,676
That's a lot of pressure.

946
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:58,850
I'm so lonely.
No. Don't say that. Please.

947
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,016
What do we do?

948
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,154
How do we make it better?

949
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:12,276
Maybe I could take an art class.
Great.

950
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:16,538
An art class. Get out of the house.
It's good.

951
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:21,911
And I think I should start spending
some nights at my apartment again.

952
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,337
Your apartment?

953
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,040
One night a week.

954
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,672
As an experiment.

955
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,056
Okay.

956
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,939
Hi, Scotty. Come here.

957
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,871
<i>The teacher's just amazing.</i>

958
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:03,035
It's kind of an older group,
but the talent level's really high.

959
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,837
I think I'm gonna learn a lot.

960
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,215
How was your night?
Terrible.

961
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,220
I'm sorry.

962
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:17,383
I don't think this experiment
is gonna work for me.

963
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,599
There has to be space
in the relationship.

964
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,935
Otherwise,
it's like we're the same person.

965
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:29,152
Listen, it's one night a week.
I think you can handle it.

966
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,771
I've gotta take a shower.

967
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,446
Come on, baby.

968
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,466
Hello?

969
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,723
<i>Hi.</i>
Hi. Where are you?

970
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:03,809
Um, a bunch of people from class
decided to go out, so we're at this bar.

971
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,563
<i>When you coming home?</i>

972
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,100
I don't know. We just got here.

973
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,356
I cooked.

974
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:14,489
Sorry, no. You know,
I think that we're just gonna eat here.

975
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,491
I mean, we already ordered, so...

976
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,904
So when are you coming home?

977
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:25,451
<i>I don't know. Your place is kind of far
and we're drinking, so...</i>

978
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,001
You know, I might be kind of late.

979
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,632
Why don't we just see each other
tomorrow?

980
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:39,214
<i>Calvin?</i>
Yeah.

981
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:43,810
Okay. Um, have a great time.

982
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,028
<i>Calvin, I wanna come home.</i>

983
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,992
No.
I have to pee.

984
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,126
Stay.

985
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:01,281
I miss you right now.

986
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,784
Oh, Calvin.

987
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:12,951
<i>I'd rather not talk about it.
</i> SABRINA:<i> I'm sorry.</i>

988
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,169
<i>I always thought you walked alone.</i>

989
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,499
<i>No man walks alone from choice.</i>

990
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,178
Where are you going?
To get the phone.

991
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,384
Can I come with you?

992
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:43,156
Two for the 7:45.

993
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,988
It's sold out. There's a 9:00.

994
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,487
Take a walk first?

995
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,656
Two for the 9.

996
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,384
Look at this.

997
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,182
Hello?

998
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:15,267
<i>Look who answered their phone.</i>

999
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,774
Cyrus, hey. Sorry, I've been busy.

1000
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:21,232
<i>No worries, man. Busy writing?</i>
Uh, yeah.

1001
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,489
<i>Yeah? Good, that's great.
I keep telling them you're working on it.</i>

1002
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,196
<i>The publishers are getting anxious
about the new book...</i>

1003
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,405
Right, the new book.

1004
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:32,243
<i>You seemed excited about it a while back...</i>
I'm out right now...

1005
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,079
<i>Any progress since then?
Can I give them some time line...?</i>

1006
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,040
Cyrus, I'm gonna call you back.
<i>What?</i>

1007
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,044
Ruby?

1008
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,010
Ruby!

1009
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,845
Ruby!

1010
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:07,445
Hey. Hey, hey. What happened?
I turned around and you were gone.

1011
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,826
You let go of my hand.
I... What?

1012
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,827
You let go of my hand.

1013
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:15,616
What...? I had to pick up
the phone.

1014
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:18,376
I know, but you let go.
Ruby.

1015
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:22,631
You didn't even notice I was gone.

1016
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,708
Ruby.

1017
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,878
Sweetie, you have to calm down.

1018
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:34,517
I'm gonna get you some water, okay?
No.

1019
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,228
No.
I'll be right back.

1020
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,877
Hi, dummy.

1021
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:13,757
Hi.

1022
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:21,440
Aah, he's chasing me.
Ha-ha-ha. No.

1023
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:25,268
Miles. Yay, Miles.

1024
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:27,483
- Thanks.
- He's a water baby.

1025
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,693
- Can I ask something?
- I'm coming to get you.

1026
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:31,028
Shoot.

1027
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,654
- What if I told you I was writing again?
- Oh, no, he kicked me.

1028
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,992
Hey, that's fantastic.

1029
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,200
What's it about?
Um...

1030
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,119
Writing again.

1031
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:46,085
All right! Meow! Meow! Meow!

1032
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:48,500
Oh. Hi.
How's it going?

1033
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,713
Good.

1034
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,799
Her tits?
No.

1035
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,964
She wasn't happy.

1036
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,513
- So I made her happy...
- I'm a queen!

1037
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,519
...and now she's like this
all the time.

1038
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,479
What are you asking me?
If it's moral? I don't know.

1039
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,357
It's obviously working.

1040
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:09,987
Think of it like Prozac.

1041
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,817
But how do I know it's real?
It's not, okay? She's not.

1042
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,860
She i... She was.

1043
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,825
Oh, no.

1044
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,706
- I want to be what's making her happy...
- I love you, baby.

1045
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,742
...without making her happy.

1046
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,625
So write "Ruby went back to normal."
No big deal.

1047
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:28,336
I'm a puppy dog swimming in the water.

1048
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,500
I think she was gonna
leave me before.

1049
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:34,547
Help. Help. Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

1050
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,685
Susie left once.

1051
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:44,222
When? Why didn't you
tell me?

1052
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,608
You had a lot going on.

1053
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:47,767
And she came back.

1054
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,858
But I still think about it.

1055
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,897
I could lose her any moment.

1056
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,133
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

1057
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,681
I'm thinking about
going away for a few months.

1058
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:25,848
By myself.
Where do you wanna go?

1059
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,361
I don't know.
Um, somewhere far.

1060
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:36,115
You could send me postcards.
I love getting mail.

1061
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:41,117
Or I might hole up here in the house,
not even go outside.

1062
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,781
Cool.

1063
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,791
We could build a pillow fort.

1064
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,871
<i>This is your proving ground.
Start with you, Michelle.</i>

1065
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,411
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- You have a superior walk.</i>

1066
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,921
<i>- I can see you doing runway, but...</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1067
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,081
What are you doing?
We have Langdon's party.

1068
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:35,875
Who?
Langdon Tharp.

1069
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:39,046
The writer. His book party's tonight.
Hey, I was watching that.

1070
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:41,556
Yeah, for days.
It's a marathon.

1071
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,308
You were always asking me
to make plans for us. I did.

1072
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:48,222
Don't quote me to myself.
I am allowed to change my mind.

1073
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:52,642
I don't want to fight about this.
Fine, great! Let's ignore it, then.

1074
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,358
<i>Now look at Sheila.
Sheila has such a unique look.</i>

1075
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,364
<i>And I think that's wonderful.
We've all noticed it.</i>

1076
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,825
<i>We love your energy.</i>

1077
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:05,113
<i>Sally made a really interesting
choice using that big tease...</i>

1078
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:06,371
<i>...but it was too much.</i>

1079
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:09,080
<i>She's not afraid to be bold.</i>

1080
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,921
I'm sorry.

1081
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:25,137
Everything's been so
up and down lately, you know?

1082
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,855
It's like my internal compass
is just gone.

1083
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,777
Maybe I should talk to someone.

1084
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,940
You used to see someone, didn't you?

1085
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:42,484
Uh, Dr. Rosenthal.

1086
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,448
Maybe you should go back.

1087
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,455
I thought we were
talking about you.

1088
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:53,165
Yeah, yeah, we are.

1089
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:57,586
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I just need to get out.

1090
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,422
See people. Be social.

1091
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,804
This party's gonna be fun.

1092
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:12,514
Langdon. Hey, Langdon, hey.

1093
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,398
Welcome to my cult.

1094
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,686
Cal, you have to talk to Adam and Mandi.
Who?

1095
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:20,731
Adam and Mandi. The producers
who wanna take over your option.

1096
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:23,616
Please, check your messages.
Cyrus, this <i>is</i> Ruby.

1097
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:25,321
Hi.
Ruby.

1098
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,202
Cyrus. Nice.

1099
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:28,908
This is Saskia.
Hi.

1100
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,698
Okay. Come.
Hi.

1101
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,163
Stay there, I'll be right back.

1102
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,714
You wanna write
the screenplay yourself?

1103
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:41,501
Oh, of course. Yes, absolutely.
Who else would?

1104
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,669
I don't know. I've never written one.

1105
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:46,510
My God, you're such a genius,
you'd pick it up like that.

1106
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,266
I've been telling him that.
He doesn't like that word.

1107
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,847
Who'd you wanna play Charlie?

1108
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,263
- I mean, that's the question, right?
- Yeah.

1109
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,862
You should come
and talk to me about it sometime.

1110
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:14,038
Now, Adam and Mandi come in
with experience from documentary films.

1111
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,372
Yeah.

1112
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,037
Everything they touch is authentic.
They make it real.

1113
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:21,504
Grounded in reality and...
We treat narrative the exact same way...

1114
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,714
You saw the baby documentary they did.
Yes.

1115
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,004
- Okay. Genius.
- Made me wanna have a kid.

1116
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,764
You have no idea how many people
told us the same thing.

1117
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,676
Well, it's true.
Can you hold this just for a second?

1118
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:34,095
No, sorry, I'll be right back.
Yeah, absolutely.

1119
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:35,558
Great to talk to you.
Okay.

1120
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,064
Talk to you in a bit.
Okay.

1121
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,396
See you later.
Okay.

1122
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:42,570
Excuse me. Sorry.

1123
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,734
Cal.
Lila.

1124
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,579
I thought you were in New York.

1125
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:54,991
Uh, no, Landgon's helping me
publish my novel.

1126
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,251
You finished your novel.

1127
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:01,756
I know, it's a big surprise, the, uh...
The dilettante finished something, right?

1128
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,082
I never said that.

1129
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,800
What about you? Are you writing?
Sure.

1130
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,932
Good. Great.

1131
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,223
I hear you're seeing someone?
Yeah. She's here.

1132
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:16,012
Excuse me.

1133
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,771
Is she a writer?
No.

1134
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,807
No, a painter.

1135
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:24,024
That's great.
It's very, um, unthreatening.

1136
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,406
You think I was threatened by you?

1137
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,534
No, Cal, why would you be?
You're a genius.

1138
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,829
You like my pool?

1139
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,125
Do I know you?
I don't think so.

1140
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:45,091
What are you doing at my party?

1141
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,801
You tell me.

1142
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:49,466
You come with someone?

1143
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,972
Calvin Weir-Fields.

1144
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:54,384
Ah, the boy wonder.

1145
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,475
So are you one of those girls
who only dates famous writers?

1146
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,144
Why? Are you a famous writer?

1147
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,022
Do you happen to have a name?

1148
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:07,564
Ruby.
Ruby.

1149
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:09,941
And what do you do, Ruby?

1150
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,448
Nothing.

1151
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:17,953
How refreshing.
What do you do in your spare time?

1152
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,495
Not much.

1153
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,541
You know, I was thinking,
I was just thinking...

1154
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,335
...tonight would be perfect
for a swim.

1155
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,970
I don't have a suit.

1156
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,512
Is that a problem?

1157
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:41,306
Never mind. I don't know why
I thought maybe you'd be happy for me.

1158
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,349
How was I anything but supportive?

1159
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,644
I read every draft.
I took you into my group.

1160
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,778
I introduced you to Langdon.
Begrudgingly.

1161
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,531
What? I literally can't hear you.
Begrudgingly.

1162
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,862
You weren't curious about me.
You never were.

1163
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,494
You just had this image
of who I was.

1164
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:58,827
And anything that I did that
contradicted it, you just ignored.

1165
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:01,788
What image? Where you left me
as soon as I wasn't successful?

1166
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:05,251
You think I gave a shit
if you were famous?

1167
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:09,125
All that I wanted was for you,
I don't know, to care about me.

1168
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,135
Care about you?
You left weeks after my father died.

1169
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,217
Do you wanna talk about caring?
Oh, God.

1170
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,803
Do you know what people say?
You were impenetrable.

1171
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:19,185
"How could you love that person?"
I tried to help.

1172
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:22,392
You refused to let me in.
And I <i>say,</i> "I have no fucking clue!"

1173
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:32,073
The only person that you wanted to be
in a relationship with was you.

1174
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,243
So I let you do that.

1175
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,245
Wow.

1176
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:41,950
You really let yourself off the hook,
don't you?

1177
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,372
Goodbye, Cal.
Goodbye.

1178
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:49,961
Have a great life.

1179
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,717
Come on.
It's nice and warm. Swim to me.

1180
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,592
You can keep your underwear on
if you like.

1181
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:56,846
Come on in.

1182
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,810
No peeking.
All right, I promise, I won't peek.

1183
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,766
All right.

1184
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:04,805
Mm.

1185
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,607
Oh, boy.

1186
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,946
Writing is sensual. It's, uh...

1187
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,862
You should see me when I write.
I'm like an Olympian.

1188
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,153
- Oh, really?
- I wield my pen...

1189
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:20,071
Your pen?
...like a lightsaber.

1190
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:23,036
What's going on here?
Calvin.

1191
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,702
We, uh... We thought we'd take a dip.

1192
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,456
Care to join us?

1193
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,391
What was that?
What was what?

1194
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,476
You know what.
Grow up.

1195
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,357
Scotty.

1196
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,185
Hey.
Hey! You're hurting me.

1197
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:52,979
Explain what you were doing.

1198
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,819
You left me alone at a party
where I didn't know anyone.

1199
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:59,281
I found someone to talk to.
In your underwear.

1200
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:01,787
Would you have been mad
if I had been in my bikini?

1201
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:03,664
You weren't wearing your bikini.

1202
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,324
Do you know what it looked like?

1203
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,744
My agent was there.
My ex was there.

1204
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,663
Lila was there?
Why didn't you tell me?

1205
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,503
I was too busy getting you
to put your clothes back on.

1206
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,419
You're supposed to be my girlfriend.
I am your girlfriend.

1207
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,632
So act like it.

1208
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:21,345
I'm sorry I wasn't acting
like the platonic ideal of your girlfriend.

1209
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,723
Jesus, you can be
such a fucking prude.

1210
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,808
I don't want you skinny-dipping
with men?

1211
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,770
Because you don't want me
doing anything!

1212
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:32,651
You have all these rules
and you don't tell me what they are...

1213
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,687
...until, whoops,
I've broken one.

1214
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:37,356
And then you get to be
disappointed with me?

1215
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,196
Okay. Uh, do you wanna know my rules?

1216
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:42,487
Don't fuck other men.
Don't let them think about fucking you.

1217
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:44,576
Now I'm responsible
for what people think?

1218
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:48,368
Yes, you are responsible. When you act
a certain way, it leads people on.

1219
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:52,004
When you take your clothes off at a party,
people think you're a slut.

1220
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:57,043
So I'd really prefer if you didn't do that.
Is that clear enough for you?

1221
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,177
Fuck you!

1222
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,346
I'm not your child!

1223
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:09,559
You don't get to decide what I do.

1224
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:13,309
Wanna bet?
What?

1225
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:17,397
I'm pretty sure I could make you do
whatever I want.

1226
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,992
What are you gonna do, Calvin?
Tie me up?

1227
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,653
No.

1228
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,072
I don't have to.

1229
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,834
Calvin...

1230
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,463
...I'm gonna call a cab.

1231
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:24,630
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

1232
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,554
Calvin.

1233
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:38,978
Fine. Go.

1234
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,076
What was that?

1235
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:51,578
You didn't feel that?

1236
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:00,591
Aah!

1237
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,503
What is that?

1238
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,344
What the fuck is going on?

1239
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:09,763
Calvin.

1240
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:19,603
Aah! Oh, my God, something is happening.
Here. Read.

1241
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:37,165
What is this?

1242
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,372
My book.

1243
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,464
The one I haven't been
working on.

1244
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,720
Wanna see?

1245
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,394
Is this some sort of joke?

1246
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:57,273
No. It's pretty serious.

1247
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:59,900
You're writing about me?

1248
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:03,563
No, you can't write about me.
That's private.

1249
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,945
I'm not writing about you.

1250
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:09,909
I wrote you.

1251
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,329
I made you up.

1252
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:17,410
What?
I had a dream about a girl.

1253
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,962
So I wrote it down.

1254
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:24,041
I gave her a name.

1255
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,797
Ruby.

1256
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:32,766
I wrote all kinds of things about her
and then one day I woke up and she...

1257
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:37,601
You were living in my house.

1258
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:43,060
I can make you do anything...

1259
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:46,151
...because you're not real.

1260
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:50,200
You're sick.

1261
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,542
Calvin?

1262
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,553
Listen to me.

1263
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:13,970
If this is how you think about people...

1264
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:19,639
...then you are in for a long,
lonely, fucked-up life.

1265
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,985
Do you hear me? Calvin?

1266
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,505
See. "Ruby speaks French."

1267
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,468
I told you I could
make you do anything.

1268
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,021
I write it.

1269
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:06,727
You do it.

1270
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:29,133
<i>Skinnamarinky dinky dink dinky do</i>

1271
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:32,878
<i>I love you</i>

1272
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,548
<i>Skinnamarinky dinky dink</i>

1273
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,474
<i>Dinky do</i>

1274
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:40,557
<i>I love you</i>

1275
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,392
<i>I love you in the morning</i>

1276
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:08,873
I love you.

1277
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:13,260
I'll never leave you. I love you.

1278
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,510
I'll never leave you.

1279
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,514
I love you. I'll never leave you.

1280
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,391
I love your mouth. I love your nose.

1281
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:22,599
I love your butt. I love your eyes.

1282
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:24,604
I love your belly. I love your ears.

1283
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:27,767
I love your cock. I love your nose.

1284
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,027
I love your mouth. I love you so much.

1285
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:34,106
I'll love you forever
and ever and ever and ever.

1286
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:40,273
You're a genius. You're a genius.
You're a genius.

1287
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,041
Rub...

1288
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:11,193
Calvin?

1289
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:18,954
Calvin.

1290
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,537
You okay?

1291
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:27,341
She's gone.

1292
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:32,013
She's gone.

1293
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:38,470
It's okay, buddy.

1294
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:04,500
Okay.

1295
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:08,379
Nothing helps.

1296
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:14,177
When was the last time you wrote, Cal?
I can't write.

1297
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,515
Sure you can.

1298
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,891
That's what you have over every other poor
schmuck out there with a broken heart.

1299
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:22,897
You can write about it.

1300
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:25,150
And who would wanna read that?

1301
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:27,231
Lots of people.

1302
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:30,439
Why not?

1303
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,282
You got a pretty great story.

1304
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:36,194
Everyone will think I'm crazy.

1305
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:39,163
No.

1306
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:42,201
They'll think it's fiction.

1307
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:17,236
<i>This is the true and impossible
story of my very great love.</i>

1308
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:20,576
<i>In the hope that she will not read this
and reproach me...</i>

1309
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:23,241
<i>...I have withheld many telling details.</i>

1310
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:25,911
<i>Her name...</i>

1311
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:29,547
<i>...the particulars of her birth
and upbringing...</i>

1312
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:32,550
<i>...and any identifying scars
or birthmarks.</i>

1313
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:38,090
<i>All the same,
I cannot help but write this for her.</i>

1314
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,217
<i>To tell her:</i>

1315
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:43,933
<i>"I'm sorry for every word
I wrote to change you.</i>

1316
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:47,399
<i>I'm sorry for so many things.</i>

1317
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:51,736
<i>I couldn't see you when you were here</i>

1318
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:57,450
<i>And now that you're gone
I see you everywhere."</i>

1319
01:35:02,572 --> 01:35:04,950
"One may read this and think it's magic...

1320
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:08,416
...but falling in love is an act of magic.

1321
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:10,626
So is writing.

1322
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:13,542
It was once said of<i> Catcher in the Rye:</i>

1323
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:17,303
'That rare miracle of fiction
has again come to pass.

1324
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:24,429
A human being has been created
out of ink, paper and the imagination.'

1325
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:27,597
I am no J.D. Salinger...

1326
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,059
...but I have witnessed
a rare miracle.

1327
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:33,778
Any writer can attest...

1328
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:36,281
...in the luckiest, happiest state...

1329
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:40,319
...the words are not coming from you,
but through you.

1330
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:44,497
She came to me wholly herself.

1331
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:49,836
I was just lucky enough to be there
to catch her."

1332
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,211
Thank you.

1333
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:08,601
Doesn't his imagination just,
uh, blow you away?

1334
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,186
I mean, where does he come up
with these ideas?

1335
01:36:11,349 --> 01:36:12,976
- Right?
- Yeah.

1336
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:15,354
Genius.
I don't know.

1337
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:17,105
I don't know.

1338
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:18,364
How are you?
What's up?

1339
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,862
It's beautiful, Calvin.

1340
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:25,196
Thank you.

1341
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:29,914
Most of my patients don't take
my assignments this seriously.

1342
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:34,798
I know you hoped that, by writing this,
I would realize that it never happened.

1343
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,003
That I imagined her.

1344
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:40,212
But the thing is...

1345
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:44,762
...I don't need to make sense of this.

1346
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,555
I don't care
if there's no good explanation.

1347
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:52,353
I need you
to believe me anyway.

1348
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:56,019
Just take the leap.

1349
01:36:56,686 --> 01:36:59,485
At least imagine how it could be true.

1350
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:01,737
For me.

1351
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:04,235
I'll work on that.

1352
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:11,000
Go potty.

1353
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,494
Go potty.

1354
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,082
Scotty. Scotty.

1355
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:21,753
Scotty.

1356
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,255
Scotty.

1357
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:27,892
Oh, hi.
Sorry.

1358
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:29,268
Hi.
Sorry, he's mine.

1359
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:31,771
It's fine. He's so friendly.

1360
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:38,611
What's his name?
Scotty.

1361
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:41,774
Scotty. That's funny, that's...

1362
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:44,613
That's the name of the dog
in this book.

1363
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:46,028
Have you read it?

1364
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,457
Did you like it?

1365
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:56,538
Sorry. Did you say something?

1366
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:59,457
Yeah, I just asked if you liked it.

1367
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:01,092
Uh, what did you think?

1368
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:05,634
My friend who lent it to me
thought it was kind of pretentious...

1369
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:08,050
...but I really like it so far.

1370
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:15,481
Have we met before?

1371
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:19,936
I don't know.

1372
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,815
You seem really familiar.

1373
01:38:25,483 --> 01:38:28,032
Maybe we knew each other
in another life.

1374
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:31,243
Or maybe we just go
to the same coffee shop.

1375
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:35,661
What do you do
besides go for walks with your dog?

1376
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,170
Um...

1377
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,878
I'm a writer.

1378
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,838
What do you write?

1379
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:49,466
So that's why you
look so familiar.

1380
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:51,551
Maybe.

1381
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:54,311
I was kidding about
my friend calling it pretentious.

1382
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:56,017
It's okay.

1383
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:01,148
Can we start over?

1384
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:05,031
Yes.

1385
01:39:11,737 --> 01:39:15,367
May I sit down?
Oh, please.

1386
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:31,549
Just don't tell me
how it ends, okay?

1387
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,595
Promise.
