1
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,797
Bing!

2
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,939
Maycomb was a tired old town

3
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,775
even in 1932 when I first knew it.

4
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,320
Somehow, it was hotter then.

5
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,158
Men's stiff collars wilted
by 9:00 in the morning.

6
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:25,621
Ladies bathed before
noon, after their 3:00 naps

7
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,916
and by nightfall were like soft teacakes

8
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,544
with frostings of
sweat and sweet talcum.

9
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,300
A day was 24 hours long,
but it seemed longer.

10
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,762
There was no hurry, for there was
nowhere to go and nothing to buy

11
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,681
and no money to buy it with.

12
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,017
Although Maycomb County
had recently been told

13
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,311
that it had nothing to
fear but fear itself.

14
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,815
That summer I was 6 years old.

15
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,067
Good morning, Mr. Cunningham.

16
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,736
Good morning, miss.

17
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,321
My daddy's getting dressed.

18
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,323
Would you like me to call him for you?

19
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,617
No, miss, I don't care to bother.

20
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,744
Why, it's no bother, Mr. Cunningham.

21
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,329
He'll be happy to see you.

22
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,830
Atticus.

23
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,417
Atticus!

24
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,836
Here's Mr. Cunningham.

25
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,381
Good morning, Walter.

26
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,091
Good morning, Mr. Finch.

27
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,510
I didn't want to bother you none.

28
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,722
I brought you these hickory
nuts as part of my entailment.

29
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,934
Thank you. The collards we
had last week were delicious.

30
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,394
Well, morning.

31
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,355
Morning, Walter.

32
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,571
Scout, I think maybe next
time Mr. Cunningham comes,

33
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,740
you'd better not call me.

34
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,533
I thought you'd want to thank him.

35
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,868
Oh, I do.

36
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,412
But I think it embarrasses
him to be thanked.

37
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,504
Why does he bring you all this stuff?

38
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,131
He is paying me for some
legal work I did for him.

39
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,133
Why is he paying you like this?

40
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,719
That's the only way he
can. He has no money.

41
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,097
Is he poor? Yes.

42
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,518
Are we poor?

43
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,770
We are, indeed.

44
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,189
Are we as poor as the Cunninghams?

45
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,566
No, not exactly.

46
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,695
The Cunninghams are
country folks, farmers.

47
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,239
The Crash hit them the hardest.

48
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,867
Scout, call your brother.

49
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,870
Atticus, Jem's up in the tree.

50
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,331
He says he won't come
down until you agree

51
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,916
to play football for the Methodists.

52
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,338
Jem?

53
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,510
Son, why don't you come
on down out of there now

54
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,554
and have your breakfast?

55
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,473
Calpurnia has a good one. Hot biscuits.

56
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,683
No, sir.

57
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,060
Not until you agree to play
football for the Methodists.

58
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,687
Son, I can't do that.

59
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,273
I explained to you, I'm
too old to get out there.

60
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,609
After all, I'm the only father you have.

61
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,988
You wouldn't want me to go and
get my head knocked off, would you?

62
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,614
I ain't coming down.

63
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,492
Suit yourself.

64
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,082
Morning.

65
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,209
Good morning, Miss Maudie.

66
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,961
What's going on over there?

67
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,797
I'm having a terrible time, Miss Maudie.

68
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,549
Jem's staying up in the tree

69
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,052
until Atticus agrees to play
football for the Methodists

70
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,305
and Atticus says he's too old.

71
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,767
Every time I want him to
do something, he's too old.

72
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,810
He's too old for anything.

73
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,313
He can do plenty of things.

74
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,316
You be good, children. Mind Cal.

75
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,194
Good morning, Maudie.

76
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,612
Good morning, Atticus.

77
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,156
He won't let me have a gun

78
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,785
and he'll only play touch
football with me, never tackle.

79
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,664
He can make somebody's will
so airtight you can't break it.

80
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,294
You count your blessings and
stop complaining, both of you.

81
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,297
Thank your stars he has
the sense to act his age.

82
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,883
Jem, he is pretty old.

83
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,593
I can't help that.

84
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,140
Hey.

85
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,687
Hey, yourself.

86
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,524
I'm Charles Baker Harris. I can read.

87
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,236
You got anything that
needs reading, I can do it.

88
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,531
How old are you?
Four-and-a-half?

89
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,116
Going on seven.

90
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,575
No wonder, then.

91
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,953
Scout's been reading since she was born,

92
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,205
and she don't start
school till next month.

93
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,500
You look right puny for going on seven.

94
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,919
I'm little, but I'm old.

95
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,882
Folks call me Dill. I'm
from Meridian, Mississippi

96
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,427
and I'm spending two weeks next
door with my aunt Stephanie.

97
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,430
My mama worked for a
photographer in Meridian.

98
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:58,561
She entered my picture in the Beautiful
Child contest and won $5 on it.

99
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,938
She gave the money to me

100
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,899
and I went to the picture
show 20 times with it.

101
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,070
Our mama's dead but we've got
a daddy. Where's your daddy?

102
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,239
I haven't got one.

103
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,283
Is he dead?

104
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,826
No.

105
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,870
Well...

106
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,123
Well, if he's not dead,
you've got one, haven't you?

107
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:23,961
Hush, Scout.

108
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,299
What did I do? What did I do?

109
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,095
Uh, Dill, this is Calpurnia.

110
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,181
Pleased to know you, Dill.

111
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,266
Pleased to know you.

112
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,560
My daddy owns the L and N Railroad.

113
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,147
He's going to let me run the
engine all the way to New Orleans.

114
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,440
Is that so?

115
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,820
He says I can invite anybody... Shh.

116
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,453
There goes the meanest man
that ever took a breath of life.

117
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,917
Why is he the meanest man?

118
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,629
Well, for one thing,

119
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,506
he has a boy named Boo

120
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,010
that he keeps chained to a
bed in the house over yonder.

121
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,806
Come on.

122
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,813
See, he lives over there.

123
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,858
Boo only comes out at night

124
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,319
when you're asleep and it's pitch dark.

125
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,614
When you wake up at
night, you can hear him.

126
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,033
Once I heard him scratching
on our screen door

127
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,827
but he was gone by the
time Atticus got there.

128
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,331
I wonder what he does in there.

129
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,167
I wonder what he looks like.

130
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,127
Well,

131
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,174
judging from his tracks,
he's about 6'6" tall.

132
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,345
He eats raw squirrels and
all the cats he can catch.

133
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,683
There's a long, jagged scar that
runs all the way across his face.

134
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,185
His teeth are yellow and rotten.

135
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,605
His eyes are popped, and
he drools most of the time.

136
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,693
Oh, I don't believe you.

137
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,362
Dill, what are you doing here?

138
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,365
My Lord, Aunt Stephanie! You
almost gave me a heart attack.

139
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,951
Dill, I don't want you playing
around that house over there.

140
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,203
There's a maniac lives
there and he's dangerous.

141
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,413
See?

142
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,499
I was just trying to warn him
about Boo. He wouldn't believe me.

143
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,876
You'd just better believe
him, Mr. Dill Harris.

144
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,212
Tell him about the time
Boo tried to kill his papa.

145
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,964
I was standing in my yard one day

146
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,550
when his mama come out
yelling, "He's killing us all. "

147
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,969
Turned out that Boo was
sitting in the living room

148
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,387
cutting up the paper for his scrapbook,

149
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,888
and when his daddy come by,

150
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,224
he reached over with his
scissors, stabbed him in his leg,

151
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,560
pulled them out and went
right on cutting the paper.

152
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,478
They wanted to send him to an asylum.

153
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,565
But his daddy said, "No Radley
is going to any asylum. "

154
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,234
So they locked him up in the
basement of the courthouse

155
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,986
till he nearly died of the damp,

156
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,696
and his daddy brought him back home.

157
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,575
There he is, to this day, sitting
over there with his scissors.

158
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,910
Lord knows what he's doing or thinking.

159
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,251
Six, seven, eight,

160
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,379
nine, ten.

161
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,927
Come on, Scout. It's 5:00.

162
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,683
Where are you going?

163
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,518
Time to meet Atticus.

164
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,187
Why do you call your daddy Atticus?

165
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,772
Because Jem does.

166
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,273
But why does he?

167
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,860
I don't know. He just started
to ever since he began talking.

168
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,449
Wait, stop.

169
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,118
Mrs. Dubose is on her porch.

170
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,580
Listen, no matter what she says
to you, don't answer her back.

171
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,792
There's a Confederate pistol
in her lap under her shawl

172
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,545
and she'll kill you as quick
as look at you. Come on.

173
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,472
Hey, Mrs. Dubose.

174
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,808
Don't you say "hey"
to me, you ugly girl.

175
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,644
You say, "Good afternoon, Mrs. Dubose. "

176
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,730
You come over here
when I'm talking to you.

177
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,023
You come over here...

178
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,733
Hey, Atticus.

179
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,735
You listen to me...
Atticus, this is Dill.

180
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,986
How do you do, Dill?

181
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,155
Don't your daddy teach
you to respect old people?

182
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,117
You come back here, Jean Louise Finch!

183
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,953
Good afternoon, Mrs. Dubose.

184
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,497
My!

185
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,417
You look like a picture this afternoon.

186
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,669
He don't say a picture of what.

187
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,296
My goodness gracious,
look at your flowers.

188
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,007
Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful?

189
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,511
Mrs. Dubose, the gardens at Bellingrath

190
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,638
have nothing to compare
with your flowers.

191
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,767
I don't think they're
as nice as last year.

192
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:49,935
I can't agree with you.

193
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,311
He gets her interested in something nice

194
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,396
so she forgets being mean.

195
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,191
I think your yard is going to
be the showplace of this town.

196
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,443
Well...

197
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,486
Grand seeing you, Mrs. Dubose.

198
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,043
"I had two cats

199
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,046
"which I brought ashore

200
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,632
"on my first raft.

201
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,803
"And I had a dog. "

202
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,975
Atticus, do you think
Boo Radley ever really

203
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,436
comes and looks in my window at night?

204
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,480
Jem says he does.

205
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,315
This afternoon when we
were over by their house...

206
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,524
Scout.

207
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,570
I told you and Jem to leave
those poor people alone.

208
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,241
I want you to stay away from their
house and stop tormenting them.

209
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,076
Yes, sir.

210
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,580
I think that's all the reading for
tonight, honey. It's getting late.

211
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,040
What time is it?

212
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,583
8:30.

213
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,793
May I see your watch?

214
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,315
"To Atticus, my beloved husband. "

215
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,404
Atticus, Jem says this watch is
going to belong to him someday.

216
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,739
That's right.

217
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,366
Why?

218
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,785
Well,

219
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,330
it's customary for the boy
to have his father's watch.

220
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,875
What are you going to give me?

221
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,591
I don't know that I have much
else of value that belongs to me.

222
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,888
But there's a pearl necklace,

223
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,100
there's a ring that
belonged to your mother.

224
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,146
And I've put them away,
and they're to be yours.

225
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,116
Good night, Scout.

226
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,492
Good night.

227
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,087
Good night, Jem. Good night.

228
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,602
Jem?

229
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,811
Yeah.

230
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,526
How old was I when Mama died?

231
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,194
Two.

232
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,780
And how old were you?

233
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,157
Six.

234
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,451
As old as I am now?

235
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,619
Mmm-hmm.

236
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,664
Was Mama pretty?

237
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,333
Mmm-hmm.

238
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,127
Was Mama nice?

239
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,213
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,467
Did you love her?

241
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,761
Yeah.

242
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,387
Did I love her?

243
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,556
Yeah.

244
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,186
Do you miss her?

245
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,562
Mmm-hmm

246
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,865
Evening, Atticus.

247
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,408
Good evening, Judge.

248
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,206
Rather warm, isn't it?

249
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,874
Yes, indeed.

250
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,465
How's Mrs. Taylor?

251
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,217
She's fine, thank you.

252
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,391
Atticus, you've heard
about Tom Robinson?

253
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,143
Yes, sir.

254
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,356
Grand jury will get around
to charging him tomorrow.

255
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,907
I was thinking about
appointing you to take his case.

256
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,832
I realize you're very busy
these days with your practice

257
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,294
and your children need a
great deal of your time.

258
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,006
Yes, sir.

259
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,597
I'll take the case.

260
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,853
I'll send a boy over for you
tomorrow, when his hearing comes up.

261
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,607
Well, uh,

262
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,651
I'll see you tomorrow, Atticus.

263
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,944
Yes, sir.

264
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,741
And thank you.

265
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,868
Yes, sir.

266
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,671
Hey, Jem.

267
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,258
I bet you a Gray Ghost
against two Tom Swifts

268
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,387
you wouldn't go any farther
than Boo Radley's gate.

269
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,435
You're scared to, ain't you?

270
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,686
I ain't scared.

271
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,356
I go past Boo Radley's house
nearly every day of my life.

272
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,900
Always running.

273
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,735
You hush up, Scout.

274
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,491
Come on, Dill.

275
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,868
Me first!

276
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,536
You gotta let Dill be first.

277
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,829
No, me.

278
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,498
Let her be first.

279
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,001
All right, get in. Hurry up.

280
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,461
All right.

281
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,797
You ready?

282
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,507
Uh-huh. Let her go.

283
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,773
Scout!

284
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,114
Scout, get away from
there! Scout, come on!

285
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,827
Scout, don't just lie there. Get up!

286
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,374
Come on, Scout.

287
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,552
Run for your life, Scout! Come on, Dill.

288
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,728
Now who's a coward?

289
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:53,066
You tell them about this back in
Meridian County, Mr. Dill Harris.

290
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,361
I'll tell you what let's do.

291
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,280
Let's go down to the courthouse

292
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,073
and see the room they locked Boo up in.

293
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,158
My aunt says it's bat-infested,

294
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,827
and he nearly died from the mildew.

295
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,996
Come on, I bet they've got chains

296
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,956
and instruments of torture down there.

297
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,208
Come on.

298
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,045
Young Finch.

299
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,172
Yes, sir.

300
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,883
If you're looking for your daddy,

301
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,551
he's inside the courthouse.

302
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,052
Thank you, sir, but
we're not looking for...

303
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,138
Thank you, Mr. Townsend, sir.

304
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,517
What is your daddy
doing in the courthouse?

305
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,936
He's a lawyer and he has a case.

306
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,564
The grand jury is
charging his client today.

307
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,026
I heard something about it last
night when Judge Taylor came over.

308
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,319
Let's go watch.

309
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,653
No, Dill.

310
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,363
He wouldn't like that.

311
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,489
Dill!

312
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,411
Dill, wait a minute.

313
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,710
Is that the courtroom? Yeah.

314
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,337
Shh.

315
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,550
I can't see anything.

316
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:01,635
Shh.

317
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,056
You all lift me up so I
can see what's going on.

318
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,767
All right. Make a saddle, Scout.

319
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,440
Not much is happening.

320
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,486
The judge looks like he's asleep.

321
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,741
I see your daddy and a colored man.

322
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,660
The colored man...

323
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:27,744
Shh.

324
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,914
The colored man looks
to me like he's crying.

325
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,248
And I've seen him...

326
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,542
I wonder what he's done to cry about.

327
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,628
What's going on?

328
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:41,132
There's a whole lot of men
sitting together on one side

329
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,761
and one man keeps pointing at
the colored man and yelling.

330
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,473
They're taking the colored man away.

331
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,266
Where's Atticus?

332
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,604
I can't see your daddy now, either.

333
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,776
I wonder where in the world...

334
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,236
Scout, Jem.

335
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,572
What in the world are you doing here?

336
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,241
Hello, Atticus.

337
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,369
What are you doing here?

338
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,456
We came down to find out
where Boo Radley was locked up.

339
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,417
We wanted to see the bats.

340
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,045
I want you all back home right away.

341
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,171
Yes, sir.

342
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,464
Run along, now.

343
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,676
I'll see you there for dinner.

344
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,564
Hey, Atticus.

345
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,775
Mr. Ewell.

346
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,154
Captain, I'm real sorry they picked you

347
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,656
to defend that nigger
that raped my Mayella.

348
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,867
I don't know why I
didn't kill him myself

349
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,702
instead of going to the sheriff.

350
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,787
That would've saved you and the sheriff

351
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,330
and the taxpayers lots of trouble.

352
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,957
Excuse me, Mr. Ewell, I'm very busy.

353
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,669
Hey, captain, somebody
told me just now that

354
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:04,841
they thought that you believed
Tom Robinson's story against ours.

355
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,635
And you know what I said?

356
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,640
I said, "You're wrong,
man. You're dead wrong.

357
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,101
"Mr. Finch ain't taking
his story against ours. "

358
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,563
They was wrong, wasn't they?

359
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,107
I've been appointed
to defend Tom Robinson.

360
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:24,027
And now that he's been charged,
that's what I intend to do.

361
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,196
You're taking his...

362
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,822
If you'll excuse me, Mr. Ewell.

363
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,996
What kind of man are you?

364
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,582
You've got children of your own.

365
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,882
Hey, Jem.

366
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,467
Jem?

367
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,730
I think we ought to stay right
here in Miss Stephanie's yard.

368
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:04,067
You don't have to come along, Angel Mae.

369
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,208
What are you going to do?

370
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,879
We're going to look in the
window at the Radley house

371
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,423
and see if we can get
a look at Boo Radley.

372
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,425
Come on, Dill.

373
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,557
Jem, please, I'm scared.

374
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,058
Then go home if you're scared!

375
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,519
I swear, Scout, you act more
like a girl all the time.

376
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,645
Come on, Dill.

377
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,729
Wait for me. I'm coming.

378
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:42,897
Shh.

379
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,655
We'll go around back,

380
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,324
crawl under the high wire fence
at the rear of the Radley lot.

381
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,452
I don't believe we
can be seen from there.

382
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,788
Shh.

383
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,465
Come on.

384
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:28,985
Come on.

385
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,033
Come on, help me.

386
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,122
Shh.

387
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,385
Don't make a sound.

388
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,312
Spit on it.

389
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,692
All right.

390
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,866
Jem... Shh.

391
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,493
Spit some more.

392
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:24,749
All right.

393
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,648
Come on.

394
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,638
Hurry.

395
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,974
Hurry.

396
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,657
Scout.

397
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,311
Quick. Come over here.

398
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,445
Shh. Shh. Quiet.

399
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,743
What are you going to do for pants, Jem?

400
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,245
I don't know.

401
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,833
Dill?

402
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,127
Dill!

403
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,879
You come on in, now.

404
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,089
Shh.

405
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,799
I'd better go.

406
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,009
Dill?

407
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,969
Coming, Aunt Stephanie.

408
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,347
So long. I'll see you next summer.

409
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,891
So long. So long.

410
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:11,976
Dill?

411
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,144
I'm coming.

412
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,063
I'm going back after my pants.

413
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,107
Please, Jem, come on in the house.

414
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,067
I can't go in without my pants.

415
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,528
Then I'm going to call Atticus.

416
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,988
No, you're not.

417
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,241
Now, listen. Atticus ain't never
whipped me since I can remember

418
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,327
and I plan to keep it that way.

419
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,454
Then I'm going with you.

420
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,580
You ain't.

421
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,083
You stay right here. I'll be
back before you can count to 10.

422
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,630
Jem.

423
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,263
One, two,

424
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,100
three, four...

425
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,311
Jem.

426
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,106
Scout. Come on in.

427
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:05,780
Five, six, seven,

428
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:11,410
eight, nine, ten,

429
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,124
eleven, twelve,

430
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,087
thirteen, fourteen.

431
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,721
Jem.

432
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,847
Shh.

433
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,351
Shh.

434
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,317
What was that?

435
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:48,155
What is it? What happened?

436
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,158
What's going on? What is it?

437
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,494
Atticus, what is it?

438
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,498
Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

439
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:03,754
Mr. Radley shot at a prowler
out in his collard patch.

440
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,673
A prowler? Oh, Maudie!

441
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,426
Whoever it was won't
be back anytime soon.

442
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,761
Mr. Radley must've scared
them out of their wits.

443
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,179
Good night. Good night.

444
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,431
Good night, Atticus.

445
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,474
Scared the living daylights out of me.

446
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,644
I swear, a prowler. He said a prowler.

447
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,191
Come on, now. The excitement
is over. Time for bed.

448
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,820
Scout, Jem.

449
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,674
Morning.

450
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,344
Good morning, Miss Maudie.

451
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:52,511
Morning, Calpurnia.

452
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,890
I came to see Jean Louise ready
for her first day at school.

453
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,391
Scout. Morning, Mrs. Maudie.

454
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,893
All ready for school? Yes, ma'am.

455
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,227
Scout!

456
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,855
What are you going to do
with yourself this morning

457
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,732
with both children at school?

458
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,485
I don't know, and that's the truth.

459
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,779
I was thinking about that just now.

460
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,906
Scout?

461
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,243
Scout? Scout!

462
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,623
Did you hear me, Scout? Now, hurry.

463
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,844
Hey, everybody, look at Scout.

464
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:34,929
Shh.

465
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,478
Come on in here, Scout.

466
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,316
Have your breakfast.

467
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,994
I think your dress is
mighty becoming, honey.

468
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,789
Now don't go tugging
at that dress, Scout.

469
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,084
You want to have it all wrinkled
before you even get to school?

470
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,506
I still don't see why I have
to wear a darn old dress.

471
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,007
You'll get used to it.

472
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,843
I'm ready. Oh, Jem.

473
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,803
Jem...

474
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,432
It's half an hour before school starts.

475
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,686
Sit back down and wait for your sister.

476
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,275
Well, hurry up, Scout.

477
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm trying to.

478
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,448
Come on. It's your first
day. You want to be late?

479
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,536
I'm ready. Come on, let's go.

480
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,459
Bye.

481
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,005
Bye, bye.

482
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,938
Darn you, Walter Cunningham!

483
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,697
Come on, Walter!

484
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,161
Cut that out! What do
you think you're doing?

485
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,334
He made me start off on the wrong foot!

486
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,878
I was trying to explain
to that darn lady teacher

487
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:35,007
why he didn't have no money for
his lunch and she got sore at me.

488
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,845
Stop it! Stop it!

489
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,356
Is your daddy Mr. Walter
Cunningham from Old Sarum?

490
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,946
Come home and have dinner with us,
Walter. We'd be glad to have you.

491
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,325
Our daddy's a friend of your daddy's.

492
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,997
Scout here is crazy. She
won't fight you no more.

493
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,128
I hope that's a dinner that you enjoy.

494
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,424
Yes, sir. I don't know
when I've had a roast.

495
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,679
We've been having squirrels
and rabbits lately.

496
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,851
My pa and I go hunting
in our spare time.

497
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,727
You've got a gun of your own?

498
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,312
Uh-huh.

499
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,231
How long have you had a gun?

500
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,774
A year or so.

501
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,362
Can I have the syrup, please?

502
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,572
Certainly, son.

503
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,117
Cal. Will you bring in
the syrup dish, please?

504
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,451
Yes, sir.

505
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,788
How old were you when you
got your first gun, Atticus?

506
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,207
Thirteen or fourteen.

507
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,963
I remember when my
daddy gave me that gun.

508
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,551
He told me that I should never
point at anything in the house.

509
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,722
And that he'd rather I'd shoot
at tin cans in the backyard.

510
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,601
But he said that sooner or
later he'd suppose the temptation

511
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,895
to go after birds would be too much.

512
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:16,859
That I could shoot all the blue
jays I wanted if I could hit them.

513
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:21,322
But to remember it was a
sin to kill a mockingbird.

514
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,157
Why?

515
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,368
I reckon because mockingbirds

516
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:30,080
don't do anything but
make music for us to enjoy.

517
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,587
They don't eat people's gardens,
don't nest in the corncribs.

518
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:41,383
They don't do one thing, but
just sing their hearts out for us.

519
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,013
How did you like school, Scout?

520
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,182
All right.

521
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,685
Thank you, Cal. That's for Walter.

522
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,710
What in the Sam Hill are you doing...

523
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,255
But, Atticus, he's gone and
drowned his dinner in syrup

524
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,883
and now he's pouring it all over.

525
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,802
Scout.

526
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:25,970
What?

527
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,888
Come out here. I want to talk to you.

528
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,691
That boy is your company

529
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,069
and if he wants to eat up that
tablecloth, you'll let him, you hear?

530
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,822
And if you can't act
fit to eat like folks,

531
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,074
you can just sit here
and eat in the kitchen.

532
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,578
Scout.

533
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,419
Scout.

534
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,428
Scout, what in the
world has got into you?

535
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,304
Not going back.

536
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,431
Now, now.

537
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,849
Not going back.

538
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,354
Atticus, I'm not going
back to school anymore.

539
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,732
Scout, it's just the first day.

540
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,359
I don't care. Everything went wrong.

541
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,863
My teacher got mad as the devil at me

542
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:29,950
and said you were teaching me to
read all wrong, and to stop it.

543
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,036
Then acted like a fool

544
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,371
and tried to give Walter
Cunningham a quarter

545
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:38,375
when everybody knows Cunninghams
won't take nothing from nobody.

546
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,295
Any fool could have told her that.

547
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,629
Well...

548
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,131
Maybe she's just nervous.

549
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,133
After all, it's her first day, too,

550
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,052
teaching school and being new here.

551
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,219
Oh, Atticus.

552
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,305
Now, wait a minute.

553
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,894
If you just learn a single trick, Scout,

554
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,646
you'll get along a lot better
with all kinds of folks.

555
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,232
You never really understand a person

556
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:05,235
until you consider things
from his point of view.

557
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:06,612
Sir?

558
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:11,116
Until you climb inside of his
skin and walk around in it.

559
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,579
But if I keep going to school,
we can't ever read anymore.

560
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,376
Scout?

561
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,130
Do you know what a compromise is?

562
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,675
Bending the law?

563
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,221
Uh...

564
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,017
No. It's an agreement
reached by mutual consent.

565
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,897
Here is the way it works.

566
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,654
You concede the necessity
of going to school

567
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,367
and we'll keep right on
reading the same every night,

568
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,161
just as we always have.

569
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,833
Is that a bargain?

570
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:07,881
There just didn't seem
to be anyone or anything

571
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,050
Atticus couldn't explain.

572
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,636
Though it wasn't a
talent that would arouse

573
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,596
the admiration of any of our friends,

574
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,432
Jem and I had to admit
he was very good at that.

575
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,687
But that was all he
was good at, we thought.

576
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,731
See, there he is!

577
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,911
Scout, Jem, come on inside.

578
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,956
Come on, get in.

579
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:51,800
Mr. Finch? This is Cal.

580
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:54,845
I swear to God, there's a mad
dog down the street apiece.

581
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,263
He's coming this way.

582
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,064
There he is.

583
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,154
He's got it all right, Mr. Finch.

584
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,160
Stay inside, Son.
Keep him in there, Cal.

585
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,788
He's within range, Heck.

586
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,209
Take him, Mr. Finch.

587
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,544
No, Mr. Tate. He can't shoot.

588
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:28,670
Don't waste time.

589
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,172
For God's sake, Mr. Finch,

590
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,382
he's got to be killed right
away, before he starts running.

591
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:35,385
Look where he is. I can't
shoot that well. You know it.

592
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,179
I haven't shot a gun in years.

593
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,431
I'd feel mighty
comfortable if you did now.

594
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,195
Don't go near that
dog, do you understand?

595
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,947
He's just as dangerous dead as alive.

596
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,240
Yes, sir.

597
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,451
Atticus?

598
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,828
Yes, Son.

599
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,374
Nothing.

600
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,835
What's the matter, boy? Can't you talk?

601
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:52,754
Didn't you know your daddy is
the best shot in this county?

602
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,549
Hush, Heck. Let's get back to town.

603
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,843
Remember, don't go near that dog.

604
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,177
Yes, sir.

605
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,764
I'll send Zeebo out
right away to pick him up.

606
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,287
Hey, Atticus. Can we go with you?

607
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,998
Can we, please?

608
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,124
Can we?

609
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,502
No. I have to go to the country on
business, and you'll just get tired.

610
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,921
No, not me. I won't get tired.

611
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:39,217
Promise to stay in the car while
I go in and talk to Helen Robinson?

612
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,344
Mmm-hmm.

613
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,138
And not nag me about
leaving if you do get tired?

614
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,931
All right, climb in.

615
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,400
Who's Helen Robinson?

616
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,277
She's the wife of the man I'm defending.

617
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:18,632
Good evening, David.

618
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,800
Evening.

619
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,343
Evening, Helen.

620
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,719
Evening, Mr. Finch.

621
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,055
I came over to tell you
about my visit with Tom.

622
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,765
Yes, sir. And to let you know

623
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,975
that I got a postponement of the trial.

624
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,686
Give things a chance to cool down.

625
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,679
Would you tell my daddy
to come out here, please?

626
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,230
You nigger lover.

627
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,085
No need to be afraid of
him, Son. He's all bluff.

628
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,477
Nigger lover!

629
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:51,326
There's a lot of ugly
things in this world, Son.

630
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,913
I wish I could keep
them all away from you.

631
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,459
That's never possible.

632
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:05,632
Cal, you wait until I get Scout
in bed. I'll drive you home.

633
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,800
Yes, sir.

634
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:25,485
Jem, would you mind staying here
with Scout till I get Cal home?

635
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,611
No, sir.

636
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,280
Night, Jem.

637
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,656
Night, Cal.

638
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,123
Atticus! Atticus!

639
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,626
Atticus!

640
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:04,310
Atticus had promised
me he would wear me out

641
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,479
if he ever heard of me fighting anymore.

642
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,608
I was far too old and too
big for such childish things

643
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,027
and the sooner I learned to hold in,

644
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,572
the better off everybody would be.

645
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,365
I soon forgot.

646
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,536
Cecil Jacobs made me forget.

647
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,624
What is it, Scout?

648
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,132
Atticus, do you defend niggers?

649
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,845
Don't say "nigger," Scout.

650
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,263
I didn't say it.

651
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,641
Cecil Jacobs did. That's
why I had to fight him.

652
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:47,103
Scout, I don't want you fighting.

653
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,564
I had to, Atticus, he...

654
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,608
I don't care what the reasons are.

655
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,194
I forbid you to fight.

656
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,529
Yes, sir.

657
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:07,207
Anyway, I'm simply defending
a Negro, Tom Robinson.

658
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,251
Scout,

659
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:15,006
there are some things that you're
not old enough to understand just yet.

660
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:22,347
There's been some high talk around town

661
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,600
to the effect that I shouldn't
do much about defending this man.

662
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:32,732
If you shouldn't be defending
him, then why are you doing it?

663
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,281
For a number of reasons.

664
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,161
The main one is that if I didn't,

665
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:47,664
I couldn't hold my head up in town.

666
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:53,753
I couldn't even tell you or
Jem not to do something again.

667
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,883
Oh, Scout.

668
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,348
You're going to hear some
ugly talk about this in school.

669
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,019
But I want you to promise me one thing,

670
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,023
that you won't get into fights over it,

671
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,734
no matter what they say to you.

672
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,701
Yes, sir.

673
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,550
What're you doing?

674
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,469
I'm walking like an Egyptian.

675
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:45,513
We were studying about them in school.

676
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:48,600
Teacher says we wouldn't
be no place without them.

677
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:49,809
Is that so?

678
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:54,355
Cradle of civilization. They
invented embalming and toilet paper.

679
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,402
That's wrong, Scout.

680
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:05,116
You dig your feet, this way.

681
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,118
Look, Jem.

682
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:27,055
Look, the boy wore his hair in
front of his eyebrows like you do.

683
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,600
And the girl wears bangs like you.

684
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,602
These are us.

685
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,410
Jem, are you awake?

686
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,828
Go back to bed.

687
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,579
I can't go to sleep.

688
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,665
Go back to bed.

689
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,127
What you got in the box?

690
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:40,753
Nothing. Go back to bed.

691
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,096
Come on.

692
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:01,774
If I show you, will you
swear never to tell anybody?

693
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,068
I swear.

694
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,571
Cross your heart.

695
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,886
I found all of these

696
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:33,473
in the knothole of that
old tree at different times.

697
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,310
This is a spelling medal.

698
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:44,067
They used to award these in
school to spelling winners

699
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,401
before we were born.

700
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:50,782
And another time I found this.

701
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,255
And this.

702
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,396
And Scout...

703
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:26,400
Something else I never told you about

704
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,528
that night I went back
to the Radley house.

705
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:32,281
Something else? You never told
me anything about that night.

706
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:34,867
Well...

707
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,496
You know the first time I was
getting out of my britches?

708
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,789
Uh-huh.

709
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,709
They was all in a tangle,
and I couldn't get them loose.

710
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,879
Well,

711
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,881
when I went back though,

712
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,884
they were folded across the fence,

713
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,388
sort of like they was expecting me.

714
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,356
It was to be a long time

715
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:09,152
before Jem and I talked about Boo again.

716
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:15,533
School finally ended and summer came

717
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,493
and so did Dill.

718
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,829
Good morning.

719
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,998
My, you're up mighty bright and early.

720
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,500
I've been up since 4:00.

721
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:26,335
4:00?

722
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,672
Yes. I always get up at
4:00. It's in my blood.

723
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,926
You see, my daddy was a
railroad man until he got rich.

724
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,761
Now he flies airplanes.

725
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,515
One of these days, he's just going
to swoop down here at Maycomb,

726
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,767
pick me up, and take me for a ride.

727
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,529
Who's that in the car with Sheriff Tate?

728
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,281
Tom Robinson, Son.

729
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,075
Where's he been?

730
00:58:58,202 --> 00:58:59,785
In the Abbotsville jail.

731
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,164
Why?

732
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,625
The sheriff thought he'd be safer there.

733
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,461
They're bringing him back here tonight,

734
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,796
because his trial is tomorrow.

735
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,815
Good evening, Heck.

736
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,442
Evening, Mr. Finch.

737
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:33,736
Come in.

738
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,743
The news has gotten around the county

739
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,162
about my bringing Tom
Robinson back to the jail.

740
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:48,167
I heard there might be trouble
from that bunch out at Old Sarum.

741
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:01,389
Cal, if I need you to stay
here tonight, can you do it?

742
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:03,182
Yes, sir, I can.

743
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,558
Thank you.

744
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,150
I think you'd better count on staying.

745
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,569
Yes, sir.

746
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,188
What's going on?

747
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,606
Shh. Go back to sleep.

748
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,108
What's going on?

749
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,234
Shh.

750
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,412
Hey, there's his car.

751
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,094
See, there he is, over there.

752
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:28,809
No, Scout, don't go to
him. He might not like it.

753
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:33,981
I just wanted to see where
he was and what he was up to.

754
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,486
He's all right. Let's
go back home. Come on.

755
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,712
He in there, Mr. Finch?

756
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:43,884
He is. He's asleep. Don't wake him.

757
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,720
You know what we want.

758
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,143
Get aside from that door, Mr. Finch.

759
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:56,188
Walter,

760
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:02,153
I think you ought to turn
right around and go back home.

761
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,488
Heck Tate's around here somewhere.

762
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,157
No, he ain't.

763
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,410
Heck and his bunch is out chasing
around Old Sarum looking for us.

764
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,037
We knew he was so we
came in this other way.

765
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:14,832
You ain't never thought about
that, had you, Mr. Finch?

766
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,125
I thought about it.

767
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,751
I can't see Atticus.

768
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,046
That changes things...

769
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,548
Atticus!

770
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:27,887
Hey, Atticus.

771
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,557
Jem, go home, and take
Scout and Dill home with you.

772
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,394
Son, I said, go home.

773
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,563
No, sir.

774
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:40,316
I'll send him home!

775
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,694
Don't you touch him. Let him go!

776
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:45,237
That'll do, Scout.

777
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,910
Ain't nobody gonna do Jem that way.

778
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,289
Now, you get them out
of here, Mr. Finch!

779
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:01,128
Jem, I want you to please leave.

780
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,923
No, sir. Jem.

781
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,592
I tell you, I ain't going.

782
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,221
Hey, Mr. Cunningham.

783
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,017
I said, hey, Mr. Cunningham.

784
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,936
How's your entailment getting along?

785
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,983
Don't you remember me, Mr. Cunningham?

786
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:26,278
I'm Jean Louise Finch.

787
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,660
You brought us some hickory
nuts one early morning, remember?

788
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,329
We had a talk.

789
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,583
I went and got my daddy
to come out and thank you.

790
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:44,797
I go to school with your boy.
I go to school with Walter.

791
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:49,426
He's a nice boy. Tell him
"hey" for me, won't you?

792
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,055
You know something, Mr. Cunningham?

793
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,641
Entailments are bad. Entailments...

794
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:09,655
Atticus, I was just saying to Mr.
Cunningham that entailments were bad

795
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:14,034
but not to worry. Takes
a long time sometimes.

796
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,038
What's the matter?

797
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,340
I sure meant no harm, Mr. Cunningham.

798
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,347
No harm taken, young lady.

799
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,395
I'll tell Walter you said "hey. "

800
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,897
Let's clear out of here.

801
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,860
Let's go, boys.

802
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,765
Now, you go home. All of you.

803
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,726
I'll be there later.

804
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:24,355
Good luck.

805
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,066
Come on.

806
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:55,552
Mr. Finch, are they gone?

807
01:06:57,222 --> 01:07:00,265
They've gone. They
won't bother you anymore.

808
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,455
Morning, Mr. Sykes.

809
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,250
How do you do? Ever see so many people?

810
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,419
Just like on Saturday.

811
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:32,798
Where you going?

812
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:36,468
I can't stand it any longer. I'm going
downtown to the courthouse to watch.

813
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,887
You'd better not. You
know what Atticus said.

814
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,305
I don't care if he did.

815
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,224
I'm not going to miss
the most exciting thing

816
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,101
that ever happened in this town.

817
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:06,665
It's packed solid. They're
standing all along the back.

818
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,419
Reverend.

819
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,587
Yes?

820
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:14,173
Reverend Sykes, are you going upstairs?

821
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,507
Yes, I am.

822
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,436
Thanks, Brother Jones,
for holding my seat.

823
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,937
Please be seated.

824
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,397
Come on, children.

825
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:31,815
It's the Rev.

826
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,519
This court is now in
session. Everybody rise.

827
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:23,367
On the night of August 21,

828
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,870
I was just leaving my
office to go home when Bob...

829
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,706
Mr. Ewell came in.

830
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,504
Very excited, he was, and he said to
get to his house as quick as I could,

831
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:37,589
that his girl had been raped.

832
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,552
I got to my car and went
out there as fast as I could.

833
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:44,596
She was pretty well beat up.

834
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:49,560
I asked her if Tom
Robinson beat her like that.

835
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,937
She said, "Yes, he had. "

836
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,024
I asked if he'd taken advantage of her.

837
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,569
She said, "Yes, he did. "

838
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:01,905
That's all there was to it.

839
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,576
Thank you.

840
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,415
Did anybody call a doctor, Sheriff?

841
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,042
No, sir. Why not?

842
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:17,379
I didn't think it was necessary.

843
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:21,800
She was pretty well beat up. Something
sure happened, it was obvious.

844
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,264
Sheriff, you say she was mighty beat up.

845
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,600
In what way?

846
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,643
She was beaten around the head.

847
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:35,439
There were bruises
already coming on her arms.

848
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,774
She had a black eye starting.

849
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:39,943
Which eye?

850
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:43,488
Let's see, it was her left.

851
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,117
Now, was that...

852
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:52,915
Was that her left, facing you,
or looking the way that you were?

853
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,461
Yes, that would make it her right eye.

854
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:01,798
It was her right eye,
Mr. Finch. Now I remember.

855
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:05,469
She was beaten up on
that side of her face.

856
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,643
Which side, again?

857
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,020
Her right side.

858
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,607
She had bruises on her arms.

859
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:22,277
And she showed me her neck.

860
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:25,155
There were definite
finger marks on her gullet.

861
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,702
All around

862
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:34,289
her neck, at the back of her throat?

863
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,168
I'd say they were all around.

864
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,053
The witness may be seated.

865
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:52,474
Robert E. Lee Ewell.

866
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,147
Place your hand on the Bible, please.

867
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:00,983
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

868
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,818
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

869
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,361
I do. Sit down, please.

870
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,825
Now, Mr. Ewell,

871
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:14,913
will you tell us, just in your own
words, what happened on August 21?

872
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:17,749
Late that night,

873
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:21,003
I was coming in from the
woods, with a load of kindling

874
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,922
and I heard Mayella screaming
as I got to the fence.

875
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:27,300
So, I dropped my kindling and
run just as fast as I could,

876
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:28,927
but I run into the fence.

877
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,555
But when I got loose,

878
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:36,226
I run up to the window, and
I seen him with my Mayella.

879
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:45,360
What did you do after
you saw the defendant?

880
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:47,779
I ran around the house trying to get in,

881
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,782
but he done run through the
front door, just ahead of me.

882
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,285
But I seen who it was, all right.

883
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,620
I seen him!

884
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,126
And I run in the house

885
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,130
and poor Mayella was lying
on the floor, squalling.

886
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:09,092
Then I run for Mr. Tate
as quick as I could.

887
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,303
Mmm-hmm.

888
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:13,930
Thank you, Mr. Ewell.

889
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:27,652
Would you mind if I just ask
you a few questions, Mr. Ewell?

890
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:30,280
No, sir, Mr. Finch, I sure wouldn't.

891
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,497
Folks were doing a lot
of running that night.

892
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:39,748
Let's see, now.

893
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:43,168
You say that you ran into the
house, you ran to the window,

894
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:47,506
you ran inside, you ran to Mayella,
and you ran to Sheriff Tate.

895
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,177
Did you, during all this
running, run for a doctor?

896
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,679
There wasn't no need
to. I seen who done it.

897
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:01,353
Now, Mr. Ewell, you've heard
the sheriff's testimony.

898
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,272
Do you agree with his
description of Mayella's injuries?

899
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:07,359
I agree with everything Mr. Tate said.

900
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:12,781
Her eye was blacked.
She was mighty beat up.

901
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,870
Mr. Ewell, can you...

902
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,706
Can you read and write?

903
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,711
Yes, Mr. Finch. I can
read and I can write.

904
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,549
Good.

905
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,886
Then will you write your name, please?

906
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,639
Right there. Show us.

907
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:10,714
Now what's so interesting?

908
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,425
You're left-handed, Mr. Ewell.

909
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,596
What's that got to do with it,
Judge? I'm a God-fearing man.

910
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,432
That Atticus Finch, he's
trying to take advantage of me.

911
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,018
You've got to watch tricky
lawyers like Atticus Finch.

912
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,187
Quiet, sir.

913
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:27,939
The witness may take his seat.

914
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,952
Mayella Violet Ewell.

915
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,133
Put your hand on the Bible, please.

916
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,596
Solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

917
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,806
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

918
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:03,475
Sit down, please.

919
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,314
Now, Mayella,

920
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:15,153
suppose you tell us
just what happened, huh?

921
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,823
Well, sir...

922
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:21,660
Sir,

923
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:27,582
I was sitting on the
porch and he come along.

924
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:33,505
There was this old
chifforobe in the yard

925
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,300
and I said,

926
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:42,305
"You come in here, boy, and bust up this
chifforobe and I'll give you a nickel. "

927
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,476
So, he come on in the yard

928
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:49,354
and I go in the house
to get him the nickel.

929
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:54,359
And I turn around, and
before I know it he's on me.

930
01:16:56,362 --> 01:17:00,448
I fought and hollered, but
he had me around the neck

931
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,868
and he hit me again and again.

932
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:09,374
And the next thing I knew,

933
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:12,877
Papa was in the room,
standing over me, hollering,

934
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,798
"Who done it?"

935
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,718
Thank you, Mayella.

936
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:23,221
Your witness, Atticus.

937
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,019
Miss Mayella,

938
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:32,731
is your father good to you?

939
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:37,235
I mean, is he easy to get along with?

940
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:40,697
Does tolerable.

941
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:42,365
Except when he's drinking?

942
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:48,747
When he's riled, has he ever beaten you?

943
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,923
My pa's never touched a
hair on my head in my life.

944
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:07,599
You say that you asked Tom
to come in and chop up a...

945
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:09,559
What was it?

946
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:12,437
A chifforobe.

947
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:18,109
Was that the first time that you ever
asked him to come inside the fence?

948
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:19,611
Yes.

949
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:25,533
Didn't you ever ask him to
come inside the fence before?

950
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:31,748
I might have.

951
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,877
But can you remember any other occasion?

952
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,128
No.

953
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:40,048
You say,

954
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,885
"He caught me, he choked me,

955
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,179
"and took advantage
of me," is that right?

956
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,144
Do you remember him
beating you about the face?

957
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:58,316
No, I don't

958
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,237
recollect if he hit me.

959
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:11,830
I mean, yes, he hit me!

960
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,421
Thank you.

961
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,549
Will you identify the man who beat you?

962
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,552
Most certainly will.
Sitting right yonder.

963
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,848
Tom, will you stand up, please?

964
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,893
Let Miss Mayella have a
good, long look at you.

965
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:46,030
Tom, will you catch this, please?

966
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:52,579
Thank you.

967
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,792
Now, then, this time,

968
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,878
will you please catch
it with your left hand?

969
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:01,963
I can't, sir.

970
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,548
Why can't you?

971
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,259
I can't use my left hand at all.

972
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,555
I got it caught in a cotton
gin when I was 12 years old.

973
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,391
All my muscles were tore loose.

974
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:33,786
Is this the man who raped you?

975
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:36,915
Most certainly is.

976
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:39,834
How?

977
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,964
I don't know how.

978
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:48,718
He just done it.

979
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:53,723
You have testified that he choked you

980
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,434
and he beat you.

981
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:01,898
You didn't say that he sneaked up
behind you and knocked you out cold,

982
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,109
but that you turned around

983
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,779
and there he was.

984
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:12,617
Do you want to tell us
what really happened?

985
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,622
I've got something to say!

986
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:22,293
And then I ain't gonna say no more!

987
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,591
He took advantage of me.

988
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:36,933
And if you fine, fancy gentlemen

989
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,477
ain't going to do nothing about it,

990
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:44,482
then you're just a bunch of
lousy, yellow, stinking cowards!

991
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,151
The whole bunch of you!

992
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,238
And your fancy airs
don't come to nothing!

993
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:53,533
Your "ma'am-ing" and
your "Miss Mayella-ing,"

994
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:56,452
it don't come to nothing, Mr. Finch!

995
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:02,917
Sit down, there.

996
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:04,043
Poor girl.

997
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:22,687
Atticus?

998
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:27,942
Mr. Gilmer?

999
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:33,948
The State rests, Judge.

1000
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,584
Tom Robinson, take the stand.

1001
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:02,018
Put your hand on the Bible.

1002
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,979
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

1003
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:06,731
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

1004
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,191
I do. Sit down.

1005
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,205
Now, Tom...

1006
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:26,459
Were you acquainted with
Mayella Violet Ewell?

1007
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,044
Yes, sir.

1008
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:31,506
I had to pass her place going
to and from the field every day.

1009
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,676
Is there any other way to go?

1010
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:37,887
No, sir, none as I know of.

1011
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,973
And did she ever speak to you?

1012
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,600
Yes, sir.

1013
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,895
I'd tip my hat when I'd go by.

1014
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:51,192
One day she asked me to
come inside the fence,

1015
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,111
bust up a chifforobe for her.

1016
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:56,614
She gave me the hatchet
and I broke it up.

1017
01:23:57,366 --> 01:24:01,411
And then she said, "I reckon I'll
have to give you a nickel, won't I?"

1018
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,080
And I said, "No, ma'am,
there ain't no charge. "

1019
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:06,749
Then I went home.

1020
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:13,464
Mr. Finch, that was way last
spring, way over a year ago.

1021
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:16,592
And did you ever go on the place again?

1022
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:21,097
Yes, sir.

1023
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,307
When?

1024
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:29,230
I went lots of times.

1025
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,859
Seemed like every time
I passed by yonder,

1026
01:24:32,943 --> 01:24:35,445
she'd have some little
something for me to do.

1027
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,281
Chopping kindling and
toting water for her.

1028
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:47,915
Tom,

1029
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:55,214
what happened to you on the
evening of August 21 of last year?

1030
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:04,849
Mr. Finch,

1031
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:08,728
I was going home as usual that evening.

1032
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,274
When I passed the Ewell place,

1033
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:17,320
Miss Mayella was on the
porch, like she said she was.

1034
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,574
She said for me to come
there and help her a minute.

1035
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:25,119
I went inside the fence

1036
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:28,581
and I looked around for
some kindling to work on,

1037
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:30,708
but I didn't see nothing.

1038
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,296
And then she said to come in the house,

1039
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,673
she has a door that needs fixing.

1040
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:42,470
So I follows her inside
and looked at the door

1041
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:44,555
and it looked all right.

1042
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:48,184
Then she shut the door.

1043
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:54,106
All the time I was wondering
why it was so quiet like.

1044
01:25:56,443 --> 01:26:00,905
Then it come to me, there
was not a child on the place.

1045
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:07,036
And I said, "Miss Mayella,
where are the children?"

1046
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:11,290
And she said they all
gone to get ice cream.

1047
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:15,127
She said it took her a slap
year to save seven nickels,

1048
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,464
but she done it, and
they all gone to town.

1049
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:22,718
What did you say then?

1050
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,265
I said something like,

1051
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:32,353
"Why, Miss Mayella, it's right
nice of you to treat them. "

1052
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:35,147
And she said, "You think so?"

1053
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:40,903
Well, I said I best be going,
I couldn't do nothing for her.

1054
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:43,239
And she said, oh, yes, I could.

1055
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:45,491
And I asked her, "What?"

1056
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:51,080
And she said to just
step on the chair yonder

1057
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:54,625
and get that box down from
on top of the chifforobe.

1058
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:59,881
So I done like she told me

1059
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,216
and I was reaching

1060
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,469
and the next thing I know,

1061
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:09,181
she grabbed me around the legs.

1062
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:19,609
She scared me so bad, I hopped
down and turned the chair over.

1063
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:21,444
That was the only thing,

1064
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,780
the only furniture
disturbed in the room,

1065
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:26,991
Mr. Finch, I swear, when I left it.

1066
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:33,539
And what happened after
you turned the chair over?

1067
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:41,339
Tom?

1068
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:50,264
You've sworn to tell the whole truth.

1069
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:52,934
Will you do it?

1070
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:57,980
What happened after that?

1071
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,445
Mr. Finch,

1072
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:10,534
I got down off the
chair and I turned around

1073
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:14,789
and she sort of jumped on me.

1074
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:18,626
She hugged me around the waist.

1075
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,129
She reached up and
kissed me on the face.

1076
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:27,885
She said she had never
kissed a grown man before

1077
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,846
and she might as well kiss me.

1078
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:34,684
She said for me to kiss her back.

1079
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:40,439
And I said, "Miss Mayella,
let me out of here. "

1080
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,149
And I tried to run.

1081
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:48,280
Then Mr. Ewell cussed
at her from the window

1082
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:51,909
and said he's going to kill her.

1083
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,795
What happened after that?

1084
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:10,678
I was running so fast, I
don't know what happened.

1085
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,773
Tom, did you rape Mayella Ewell?

1086
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,612
I did not, sir.

1087
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,491
Did you harm her in any way?

1088
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:41,709
I did not, sir.

1089
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,147
Robinson,

1090
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,735
you're pretty good at
busting up chifforobes

1091
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,737
and kindling with one hand, aren't you?

1092
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:12,239
Strong enough to choke
the breath out of a woman

1093
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,200
and sling her to the floor?

1094
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,410
I've never done that, sir.

1095
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:18,496
But you're strong enough to?

1096
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,540
I reckon so, sir.

1097
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,042
Mmm-hmm.

1098
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:32,426
How come you were so all-fired
anxious to do that woman's chores?

1099
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:40,017
Looks like she didn't
have nobody to help her.

1100
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:42,269
Like I said...

1101
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:45,106
With Mr. Ewell and seven
children on the place?

1102
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:49,360
You did all this chopping and
work out of sheer goodness, boy?

1103
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,572
You're a mighty good fellow, it seems.

1104
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:56,200
Did all that for not one penny.

1105
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:58,452
Yes, sir.

1106
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,706
I felt right sorry
for her. She seemed...

1107
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,725
You felt sorry for her?

1108
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:24,478
A white woman?

1109
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,733
You felt sorry for her.

1110
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:04,435
To begin with,

1111
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:08,606
this case should never
have come to trial.

1112
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:13,194
The State has not produced
one iota of medical evidence

1113
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:16,488
that the crime Tom
Robinson is charged with

1114
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,700
ever took place.

1115
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:25,956
It has relied instead upon
the testimony of two witnesses

1116
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:30,169
whose evidence has not only
been called into serious question

1117
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:31,962
on cross-examination,

1118
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:36,467
but has been flatly
contradicted by the defendant.

1119
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:41,847
There is circumstantial
evidence to indicate

1120
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:46,393
that Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely

1121
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:52,024
by someone who led, almost
exclusively, with his left.

1122
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:58,906
And Tom Robinson now sits
before you, having taken the oath

1123
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,659
with the only good hand he possesses,

1124
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,078
his right.

1125
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,176
I have nothing but pity in my heart

1126
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:23,847
for the chief witness for the State.

1127
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:31,855
She is the victim of cruel
poverty and ignorance.

1128
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:42,283
But my pity does not extend so far

1129
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:45,953
as to her putting a man's life at stake,

1130
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:51,292
which she has done in an effort
to get rid of her own guilt.

1131
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:56,130
I say "guilt," gentlemen,

1132
01:33:56,256 --> 01:34:01,218
because it was guilt that motivated her.

1133
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:05,055
She's committed no crime.

1134
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:12,104
She has merely broken a rigid and
time-honored code of our society.

1135
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:17,776
A code so severe, that whoever
breaks it is hounded from our midst

1136
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,737
as unfit to live with.

1137
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:24,908
She must destroy the
evidence of her offense.

1138
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:30,914
But, what was the
evidence of her offense?

1139
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:35,085
Tom Robinson, a human being.

1140
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:41,467
She must put Tom Robinson away from her.

1141
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:47,473
Tom Robinson was to her a daily reminder

1142
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,641
of what she did.

1143
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:52,728
What did she do?

1144
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:58,776
She tempted a Negro. She was
white, and she tempted a Negro.

1145
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:04,239
She did something that in
our society is unspeakable.

1146
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,493
She kissed a black man.

1147
01:35:08,995 --> 01:35:10,454
Not an old uncle,

1148
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:15,292
but a strong, young Negro man.

1149
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:21,799
No code mattered to
her before she broke it.

1150
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:25,803
But it came crashing
down on her afterwards.

1151
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:35,604
The witnesses for the State,

1152
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:38,190
with the exception of the
sheriff of Maycomb County,

1153
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:41,318
have presented themselves to
you gentlemen, to this court,

1154
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:46,865
in the cynical confidence

1155
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,993
that their testimony
would not be doubted,

1156
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:56,375
confident that you gentlemen
would go along with them

1157
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,127
on the assumption,

1158
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,800
the evil assumption
that all Negroes lie,

1159
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:08,303
all Negroes are
basically immoral beings,

1160
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:12,724
all Negro men are not to
be trusted around our women.

1161
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:20,566
An assumption that one associates
with minds of their caliber

1162
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:26,071
and which is, in
itself, gentlemen, a lie

1163
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:32,077
which I do not need to point out to you.

1164
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:39,751
And so,

1165
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:44,047
a quiet, humble, respectable Negro

1166
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:48,510
who has had the unmitigated temerity

1167
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:51,263
to feel sorry for a white woman

1168
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:57,394
has had to put his word
against two white people's.

1169
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:06,403
The defendant is not guilty,

1170
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:10,574
but somebody in this courtroom is.

1171
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:13,952
Now, gentlemen,

1172
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:17,372
in this country,

1173
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:21,585
our courts are the great levelers.

1174
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:23,462
In our courts,

1175
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:29,426
all men are created equal.

1176
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,263
I'm no idealist

1177
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:36,141
to believe firmly in the integrity

1178
01:37:36,226 --> 01:37:38,477
of our courts and in our jury system.

1179
01:37:38,937 --> 01:37:43,106
That's no ideal to me. That
is a living, working reality.

1180
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:52,282
I am confident that you
gentlemen will review

1181
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:56,411
without passion

1182
01:37:56,496 --> 01:37:59,289
the evidence that you have heard,

1183
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:02,334
come to a decision

1184
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:06,505
and restore this man to his family.

1185
01:38:17,267 --> 01:38:19,059
In the name of God,

1186
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,230
do your duty.

1187
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:34,074
In the name of God,

1188
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,619
believe Tom Robinson.

1189
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:16,283
How long has the jury
been out now, Reverend?

1190
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:18,619
Let's see.

1191
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:21,538
Almost two hours now.

1192
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:27,711
I think that's an awful
good sign, don't you?

1193
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:16,259
Court's now in session. Everybody rise.

1194
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:40,450
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1195
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:42,452
We have, Your Honor.

1196
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:50,460
Will the defendant please
rise and face the jury?

1197
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,303
What is your verdict?

1198
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:04,099
We find the defendant guilty as charged.

1199
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:26,830
Gentlemen, this jury is dismissed.

1200
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:33,503
Court's adjourned.

1201
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:48,018
I'll go to see Helen, first
thing tomorrow morning.

1202
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:51,271
I told her not to be disappointed,
we'd probably lose this one.

1203
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:54,357
Tom.

1204
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:11,333
Yes, Mr. Finch.

1205
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:58,255
Miss Jean Louise?

1206
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:02,217
Stand up.

1207
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:08,932
Your father's passing.

1208
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:38,503
Atticus.

1209
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:46,469
I'm sorry, Atticus.

1210
01:43:46,929 --> 01:43:48,138
Thank you, Maudie.

1211
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,816
Atticus, can I see you for a minute?

1212
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:04,321
Will you excuse me?

1213
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:31,097
Jem?

1214
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:33,642
Yes, ma'am.

1215
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:39,981
I don't know if it'll help,

1216
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:43,026
but I want to say this to you.

1217
01:44:48,032 --> 01:44:49,866
There are some men in this world

1218
01:44:51,953 --> 01:44:55,372
who were born to do our
unpleasant jobs for us.

1219
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:01,336
Your father's one of them.

1220
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:07,550
Oh, well.

1221
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:35,578
What's the matter, Atticus?

1222
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,251
Tom Robinson is dead.

1223
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:56,766
They were taking him to
Abbotsville for safekeeping.

1224
01:45:58,269 --> 01:45:59,936
Tom broke loose and ran.

1225
01:46:02,106 --> 01:46:03,773
The deputy

1226
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:07,277
called out to him to stop.

1227
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:09,362
Tom didn't stop.

1228
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:15,869
He shot at him to wound
him and missed his aim.

1229
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:20,790
Killed him.

1230
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:27,464
The deputy says,

1231
01:46:31,802 --> 01:46:34,262
"Tom just ran like a crazy man. "

1232
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:48,818
The last thing I told him was not to
lose heart, that we'd ask for an appeal.

1233
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:00,622
We had such a good chance.

1234
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:08,171
We had more than a good chance.

1235
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:25,355
I have to go out and tell his family.

1236
01:47:26,982 --> 01:47:29,192
Would you look after
the children, Maudie?

1237
01:47:35,116 --> 01:47:37,867
Atticus, you want me to go with you?

1238
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:40,829
No, Son. I think I'd
better go up there alone.

1239
01:47:41,664 --> 01:47:42,997
Atticus.

1240
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,042
I'm going with you.

1241
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:50,171
All right, Son.

1242
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:17,407
Hello, Mr. Finch. I'm
Spence, Tom's father.

1243
01:48:18,576 --> 01:48:20,034
Hello, Spence.

1244
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:24,080
Is Helen here?

1245
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:27,709
Yes, sir. She's inside, lying
down, trying to get a little sleep.

1246
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:30,503
We've been talking about
the appeal, Mr. Finch.

1247
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:32,255
How long you think it will take?

1248
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:36,301
Spence...

1249
01:48:37,887 --> 01:48:40,221
There isn't going to be any appeal.

1250
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:44,642
Not now. Tom is dead.

1251
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:46,144
Dead?

1252
01:48:53,444 --> 01:48:54,736
Helen.

1253
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:26,893
Boy,

1254
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:32,482
go inside and tell Atticus
Finch I said, "Come out here. "

1255
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:35,526
Go on, boy.

1256
01:51:13,834 --> 01:51:16,669
By October, things
had settled down again.

1257
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:22,800
I still looked for Boo every
time I went by the Radley place.

1258
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:30,224
This night, my mind was
filled with Halloween.

1259
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:34,771
There was to be a pageant representing
our county's agricultural products.

1260
01:51:36,023 --> 01:51:38,024
I was to be a ham.

1261
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:43,112
Jem said that he would escort
me to the school auditorium.

1262
01:51:44,823 --> 01:51:48,826
Thus began our longest journey together.

1263
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:08,638
Scout?

1264
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:10,139
Yeah?

1265
01:52:10,682 --> 01:52:14,268
Will you come on? Everybody's gone!

1266
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,729
I can't go home like this!

1267
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:21,150
I'm going. It's almost 10:00 and
Atticus will be waiting for us.

1268
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:23,861
All right, I'm coming.

1269
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:28,449
But I feel like a fool,
walking home like this.

1270
01:52:28,534 --> 01:52:30,868
It's not my fault you lost your dress.

1271
01:52:31,036 --> 01:52:33,746
I didn't lose it. I just can't find it.

1272
01:52:33,914 --> 01:52:35,623
Where are your shoes?

1273
01:52:35,707 --> 01:52:37,417
I can't find them, either.

1274
01:52:37,835 --> 01:52:39,210
You can get them tomorrow.

1275
01:52:39,294 --> 01:52:40,586
But tomorrow is Sunday.

1276
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:43,548
You can get the janitor
to let you in. Come on.

1277
01:53:11,452 --> 01:53:14,662
Here, Scout, let me hold on to
you before you break your neck.

1278
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:20,877
You don't have to hold me.

1279
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:22,044
Shh.

1280
01:53:23,964 --> 01:53:25,298
What's the matter?

1281
01:53:25,382 --> 01:53:26,716
Hush a minute, Scout.

1282
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:37,101
I thought I heard something.

1283
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:41,481
Ah!

1284
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:42,607
Come on.

1285
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:54,619
Wait.

1286
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:58,164
Are you trying to scare me? Shh.

1287
01:53:58,248 --> 01:53:59,332
You know I'm too old.

1288
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:00,500
Be quiet.

1289
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,755
I heard an old dog then.

1290
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:08,508
It's not that. I hear it
when we're walking along.

1291
01:54:09,343 --> 01:54:11,344
When we stop, I don't hear it anymore.

1292
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:15,139
Oh, yeah, my costume rustling.

1293
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:17,767
Halloween got you.

1294
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:27,026
I hear it now.

1295
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:31,239
I'll bet it's just old Cecil
Jacobs trying to scare us.

1296
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:34,992
Cecil Jacobs is a big wet hen!

1297
01:54:42,376 --> 01:54:43,459
Come on.

1298
01:55:24,209 --> 01:55:27,878
Run, Scout! Run, Scout! Run, run!

1299
01:57:16,488 --> 01:57:18,280
Scout! Scout!

1300
01:57:21,785 --> 01:57:23,369
What happened?

1301
01:57:23,453 --> 01:57:25,955
I swear I don't know. I just don't know.

1302
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:30,000
Cal, you go and tell Dr.
Reynolds to come over.

1303
01:57:30,127 --> 01:57:31,127
Yes, sir.

1304
01:57:32,796 --> 01:57:33,921
You all right?

1305
01:57:34,005 --> 01:57:35,089
Yes, sir.

1306
01:57:35,173 --> 01:57:36,173
Are you sure?

1307
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:37,299
Yes, sir.

1308
01:57:45,976 --> 01:57:47,727
Sheriff Tate, please.

1309
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:50,604
Atticus, is Jem dead?

1310
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:52,982
No, he's unconscious.

1311
01:57:53,525 --> 01:57:56,569
We won't know how badly he's
hurt until the doctor gets here.

1312
01:57:56,862 --> 01:58:01,490
Heck, Atticus Finch. Someone's
been after my children.

1313
01:58:04,745 --> 01:58:06,996
He's got a bad break,
so far as I can tell.

1314
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:09,582
Like somebody tried
to wring his arm off.

1315
01:58:17,424 --> 01:58:19,008
I'll be right back, Atticus.

1316
01:58:20,761 --> 01:58:22,052
How's the boy, Doc?

1317
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:23,345
He'll be all right.

1318
01:58:26,683 --> 01:58:28,184
Sheriff Tate.

1319
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:49,371
What is it, Heck?

1320
01:58:54,294 --> 01:58:57,463
Bob Ewell's lying on the ground,
under that tree down yonder

1321
01:58:57,547 --> 01:58:59,799
with a kitchen knife
stuck up under his ribs.

1322
01:59:03,595 --> 01:59:04,929
He's dead, Mr. Finch.

1323
01:59:19,903 --> 01:59:21,737
You sure? Yes, sir.

1324
01:59:26,117 --> 01:59:28,577
He's not gonna bother
these children anymore.

1325
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:33,666
Miss Scout, do you think you
could tell us what happened?

1326
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:36,919
I don't know.

1327
01:59:37,587 --> 01:59:41,590
All of a sudden somebody grabbed
me, knocked me down on the ground.

1328
01:59:42,425 --> 01:59:43,759
Jem found me then.

1329
01:59:44,678 --> 01:59:48,973
Then Mr. Ewell, I reckon, grabbed
him again, and Jem hollered.

1330
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:53,811
Then somebody grabbed
me. Mr. Ewell, I guess.

1331
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:56,355
Somebody grabbed him.

1332
01:59:57,524 --> 02:00:00,442
Then I heard someone
panting and coughing.

1333
02:00:04,698 --> 02:00:07,032
And I saw someone carrying Jem.

1334
02:00:07,367 --> 02:00:08,534
Who was it?

1335
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:15,165
There he is, Mr. Tate.

1336
02:00:15,959 --> 02:00:17,626
He'll tell you his name.

1337
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:47,197
Hey, Boo.

1338
02:00:49,326 --> 02:00:53,370
Miss Jean Louise, Mr. Arthur Radley.

1339
02:00:56,041 --> 02:00:58,375
I believe he already knows you.

1340
02:01:08,178 --> 02:01:10,262
Heck, let's go out on the front porch.

1341
02:01:22,692 --> 02:01:25,694
Would you like to say good
night to Jem, Mr. Arthur?

1342
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:52,638
You can pet him, Mr.
Arthur. He's asleep.

1343
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:56,892
You couldn't if he was awake,
though. He wouldn't let you.

1344
02:02:00,563 --> 02:02:01,647
Go ahead.

1345
02:02:40,562 --> 02:02:42,646
Come sit in the swing, Mr. Arthur.

1346
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:54,616
I guess that the thing to do is...

1347
02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:02,499
Good Lord, I must be losing my memory.

1348
02:03:05,253 --> 02:03:09,590
I can't remember
whether Jem is 12 or 13.

1349
02:03:13,887 --> 02:03:18,682
Anyway, it'll have to come
before the County court.

1350
02:03:22,437 --> 02:03:25,856
Of course, it is a clear-cut
case of self-defense.

1351
02:03:26,357 --> 02:03:29,693
I'll run down to the office...

1352
02:03:29,778 --> 02:03:31,070
Mr. Finch,

1353
02:03:32,614 --> 02:03:36,033
do you think Jem killed Bob
Ewell? Is that what you think?

1354
02:03:38,912 --> 02:03:40,704
Your boy never stabbed him.

1355
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:00,766
Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1356
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:03,852
He killed himself.

1357
02:04:09,234 --> 02:04:11,401
There's a black man dead for no reason

1358
02:04:12,237 --> 02:04:14,404
and now the man
responsible for it is dead.

1359
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:19,118
Let the dead bury the
dead this time, Mr. Finch.

1360
02:04:19,202 --> 02:04:21,036
I never heard tell
it was against the law

1361
02:04:21,121 --> 02:04:22,871
for any citizen to do his utmost

1362
02:04:22,956 --> 02:04:24,456
to prevent a crime from being committed,

1363
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:26,333
which is exactly what he did.

1364
02:04:26,626 --> 02:04:28,794
But maybe you'll tell
me that it's my duty

1365
02:04:28,878 --> 02:04:31,380
to tell the town all about
it, not to hush it up.

1366
02:04:32,257 --> 02:04:33,966
You know what will happen then.

1367
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:37,553
All the ladies in
Maycomb, including my wife,

1368
02:04:38,054 --> 02:04:40,764
will be knocking on his door
bringing angel food cakes.

1369
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:43,058
To my way of thinking,

1370
02:04:43,852 --> 02:04:47,312
taking the one man who's done
you and this town a big service

1371
02:04:47,564 --> 02:04:50,774
and dragging him, with his
shy ways, into the limelight,

1372
02:04:52,443 --> 02:04:53,902
to me, that's a sin.

1373
02:04:55,488 --> 02:04:59,658
It's a sin and I'm not
about to have it on my head.

1374
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:03,745
I may not be much, Mr. Finch,

1375
02:05:04,873 --> 02:05:07,082
but I'm still Sheriff of Maycomb County

1376
02:05:08,459 --> 02:05:10,794
and Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1377
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:14,047
Good night, sir.

1378
02:05:53,755 --> 02:05:55,255
Mr. Tate was right.

1379
02:06:00,595 --> 02:06:02,012
What do you mean?

1380
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:10,187
It would be sort of like shooting
a mockingbird, wouldn't it?

1381
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:41,009
Thank you, Arthur.

1382
02:06:49,686 --> 02:06:51,144
Thank you for my children.

1383
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:09,496
Neighbors bring food with death

1384
02:07:10,123 --> 02:07:14,751
and flowers with sickness,
and little things in between.

1385
02:07:16,129 --> 02:07:17,629
Boo was our neighbor.

1386
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:23,260
He gave us two soap dolls,
a broken watch and chain,

1387
02:07:24,387 --> 02:07:26,054
a knife

1388
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,598
and our lives.

1389
02:07:34,439 --> 02:07:36,565
One time, Atticus said

1390
02:07:36,983 --> 02:07:38,608
you never really knew a man

1391
02:07:38,693 --> 02:07:41,528
until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them.

1392
02:07:47,243 --> 02:07:50,245
Just standing on the
Radley porch was enough.

1393
02:07:57,879 --> 02:08:01,214
The summer that had begun
so long ago had ended

1394
02:08:01,424 --> 02:08:03,759
and another summer had taken its place,

1395
02:08:04,427 --> 02:08:08,388
and a fall, and Boo Radley had come out.

1396
02:08:12,935 --> 02:08:15,937
I was to think of these days many times,

1397
02:08:16,356 --> 02:08:20,901
of Jem and Dill and Boo
Radley and Tom Robinson

1398
02:08:23,488 --> 02:08:25,364
and Atticus.

1399
02:08:33,915 --> 02:08:36,124
He would be in Jem's room all night.

1400
02:08:37,877 --> 02:08:41,838
And he would be there when
Jem waked up in the morning.
