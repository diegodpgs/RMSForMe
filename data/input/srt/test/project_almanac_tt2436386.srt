00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,130
Uh, what is your brother doing?

314
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,247
No offense, Christina,

315
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,210
but that's kind of creepy.
He's just watching a tape of kids.

316
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,448
- Ew!
- ADAM: You don't know...

317
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,807
CHRIS: Let me guess,
you found aliens at your party, too.

318
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Okay, we're gonna be using
some really big words...

319
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,365
CHRIS: David, that's not you.

320
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,647
Okay, no! This is definitely me.

321
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,370
- ADAM: Maybe.
- Look!

322
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,922
That is my T-shirt, that is my backpack

323
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,849
and that is my watch. That's me.

324
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,850
Wait! What's the thing in your hand?
The ballerina thing.

325
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,368
DAVID: What?
ADAM: Oh, uh...

326
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,444
A keychain, I think?

327
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,284
CHRIS: Okay.
Everybody, take out your keys.

328
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,362
Maybe it's not you, man.

329
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,364
Shit. Whose stuff is this in my bag?

330
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,646
Wait, wait. This is Jessie Pierce's.

331
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,006
- What?
- Are you serious?

332
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,481
You have a hot chick bag.
You're like a hot chick!

333
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,005
This is what you need to do.
Go over there

334
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,411
and pretend like you just don't care.

335
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,369
Throw it at her and be like,
"Yo, here's your shit, Pierce."

336
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,726
I'm sorry.
Have you seen David with girls?

337
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,848
Oh, I'm still right here, Chris. Be nice.

338
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,967
Oh!

339
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,369
No! I will go give this back to her.

340
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,488
No, no, no. I'm gonna go
and take it back to her, okay.

341
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,686
That's right.

342
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,330
I'm not gonna let
my sister do my bidding.

343
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,131
Man. Man. Yo, let me
smell your breath, though.

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,320
Are you trying to communicate
with me telepathically?

347
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,925
Excuse me, I...

348
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,970
I have... I think you have my bag.

349
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,320
I think we switched bags.

350
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,210
Possibly? Looks like.
By the way, my name is...

351
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,611
- David?
- Yeah.

352
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,842
We've gone to school
together for four years.

353
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,161
Yeah.

354
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,522
Did you go through my stuff?

355
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,361
No.

356
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,809
I might have reached in there a little bit

357
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,649
to kinda feel around blindly, but...

358
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,649
Is that why you're wearing my perfume?

359
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,167
Well... I didn't spray that.
That wasn't me.

360
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,283
So other people
went through my stuff, too.

361
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm really sorry, okay.

362
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,364
I just came to switch bags with you.

363
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,761
I would never have...
I would never do that.

David?

365
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,168
- Yeah.
- Congrats on MIT.

Um... Thank you.

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,246
Dude, David, you've lived here your
whole life. Where are you gonna go?

368

can you stop talking about it all the time?

369

Guys, stop arguing
for two seconds, okay.

370
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,009
We need to figure out what
I'm doing on this tape, right?

371
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,201
So... So, I'm over here?

372
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,401
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're back there.

Yeah, that's good.

376
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,530
Actually, move the camera
to the left a little.

377
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,360
- CHRIS: Okay.
- And you, back to the right.

That's perfect, that's perfect.

385
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,085
is reaching for something.
Like, maybe the wall?

386

- Are you okay?
- DAVID: Yeah.

- Yeah, um...

I forgot my notebook in class.

Okay. I'll see you later.

Hey. Guys, what's the emergency?

1898
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,080
David, look at this.
There was a plane crash, David.

1899
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,766
Seventy-seven people on board a flight
from London to Madrid.

1900
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,609
It happened five days ago.

1901
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,841
DAVID: Jesus.

1902
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,529
So, why are you guys
watching a plane crash?

1903
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,804
Because I think it's our fault.

1904
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,963
Why would a plane crash be our fault?

1905
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,044
Sarah Nathan's dad was the pilot.

1906
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,246
So what?

1907
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,970
Look, whatever we did at Lollapalooza

1908
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,645
had some crazy ripple effects.

1909
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,567
Wait, wait. Are you saying
that Lollapalooza caused a plane crash?

1910
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,642
Because that sounds crazy, dude.

1911
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,491
Look, I'm not crazy, okay.
It's cause and effect.

1912
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,684
Somehow we caused the basketball
team to not make the playoffs.

1913
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,966
Our captain, Justin Kelly,
broke his leg on March 1st, right?

1914
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,440
We all know that never happened.

1915
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,608
Then the basketball team
didn't make the playoffs,

1916
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,648
and that affected the players,

1917
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,331
their parents,

1918
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,120
hundreds of people who were
supposed to be at the game.

1919
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,009
And it just kept spreading.

1920
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,482
Sarah Nathan's brother,
he was on the team, right?

1921
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,687
QUINN: Yeah.

1922
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,084
Her dad was supposed to be
at the game.

1923
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,049
He wasn't supposed to be
flying that night.

1924
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,247
David, look...

1925
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,520
Dude, there's other shit, too.

1926
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,764
Robberies. Fires.
None of this happened before.

1927
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,089
At some point, we're not gonna
be able to track this, David.

1928
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,606
If we don't stop this now,
it could just keep going out of control.

QUINN: Look,
Lollapalooza was a mistake.

1931
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,851
We have to go back and make it so that

1932

- we never jumped there in the first place.
- Right.

I don't even think...

who set the rules!

we had to be all freaking careful!

01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:07,366
Dad must have a million ideas
lying around up here.

2336
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:08,606
I don't know, Chris.

2337
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,085
I mean, I thought there'd be
something up here.

2338
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,601
I can't find anything I can use.

2339
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,404
CHRIS: Hey, what is this?

2340
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,408
When did we get a video camera?

2341
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:27,121
Oh, it's right here.
This is Dad's old camera.

2342
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,447
Did Dad have two old cameras?

2343
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,524
Uh, I don't know. Yeah. I guess.

2344
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,090
They both say "Property of Ben Raskin."

2345
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,366
Yeah, let me see.

2346
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,728
Weird. Do they work?

2347
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,131
Yeah, it's playing.

2348
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,971
CHRIS: (ON CAMERA)
<i>When did we get a video camera?</i>

2349
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:45,970
DAVID: <i>Oh, that's Dad's old camera.
Remember that?</i>

2350
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,926
CHRIS: <i>Yeah.
Hey, look, it still works.</i>

2351
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,125
QUINN: I mean, what the hell
is he supposed to say to her?

2352
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,969
He can't just walk up to her and be like...

2353
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,606
CHRIS: (SHUSHING)
Would you just be quiet?

2354
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,486
Are you trying to communicate with me...

2355
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,931
Telepathically.

2356
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:10,965
How did you know I was gonna say that?

2357
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,331
This is gonna sound crazy,

2358
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,841
but I think we're
about to change the world.
