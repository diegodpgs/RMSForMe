1
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:57,678
According to legend,

2
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:00,839
in the late 19th century
something terrible happened,

3
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:03,726
to the Valdemars.
They were initiated

4
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:06,037
into the dangerous art of the occult,

5
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:07,435
and during a session,

6
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:10,724
awakened a being
far beyond their control.

7
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,645
The result of their boldness.

8
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:18,160
The beautiful Leonor was sacrificed.

9
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:23,005
Her bloodline would be forever joined
to the curse known as.

10
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,121
The Valdemar Legacy.

11
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:32,877
The Valdemar house
remained sealed for years.

12
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:35,356
No one dared go inside.

13
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:37,916
Until two weeks ago,
when an expert historian,

14
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:40,965
fascinated by its secrets,

15
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:43,243
ventured into the mansion.

16
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,357
He was never heard from again.

17
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:53,125
The legend was brought back to life,

18
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:56,239
and new faces appeared in the story.

19
00:01:58,207 --> 00:01:59,526
Luisa Lorente,

20
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:03,965
an estate valuer sent to finish
the work of her predecessor,

21
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:06,561
found out what happened to him,

22
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:12,441
and met the mansions caretaker.

23
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:13,876
She would later escape,

24
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,435
but her whereabouts remain unknown.

25
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,197
Four days after she went missing,

26
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:32,918
her boss, Maximilian Colvin,
hired detective Nicolas Tramel,

27
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:37,126
to find her and put an end
to these strange disappearances.

28
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:44,126
Tramel set off,

29
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:45,879
on a bizarre journey to the house,

30
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:48,163
with Doctor Nora Cervia,

31
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:52,479
Maximilians assistant,
who told him about the Valdemar legend,

32
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:54,365
although she withheld,

33
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:55,960
certain secrets from him.

34
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,958
A similar fate awaits Eduardo and Ana,

35
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:06,436
Luisa's co-workers,
who dont understand

36
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:09,405
why the police haven't been involved

37
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:14,436
or why Maximilian has ordered them
to join the search immediately,

38
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:17,485
leaving that very night
forthe Valdemar house.

39
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:22,285
A mystery hidden in the shadows,

40
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:26,440
and the most horrible of all...
grows near.

41
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:33,484
THE FORBIDDEN SHADOW

42
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:41,239
Are we almost there, honey?

43
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,838
Civilization is nowhere in sight.

44
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:47,646
They probably speak
a different language out here.

45
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,446
Ana, whas wrong?

46
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,165
Did I say something?

47
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:54,681
No, honey, really.

48
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:58,044
We haven't done anything together
in three months.

49
00:03:58,207 --> 00:03:59,720
I was hoping this weekend...

50
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:02,606
I know. This is just
something that happened.

51
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,241
- After we find Luisa...
- Thas another thing.

52
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,637
I dont mean her, its just...

53
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:11,196
I dont like how quiet
they're keeping this.

54
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:14,677
Inmoberance has always kept
a low profile.

55
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:18,363
We did sign a confidentiality clause.

56
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,685
The pay is great, the pension

57
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,839
couldnt be better...
But no questions asked.

58
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:25,486
What if we do ask?

59
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:29,036
What would be the answer?

60
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:33,002
Two cover-ups, no statements,
two people missing...

61
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:36,206
Were probably exaggerating.
Luisa isn't a child.

62
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:38,236
Watch out!

63
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:46,162
Are you okay?

64
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,316
Yeah.

65
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:51,358
- Where are you going?
- Stay here.

66
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:52,755
- Dont leave me.
- Hold on.

67
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,395
Shit.

68
00:04:58,287 --> 00:04:59,720
Use your cell, call for help!

69
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:08,803
Ana, what is it?

70
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:56,120
You were telling me
about last year.

71
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:57,959
And after the divorce?

72
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:01,119
I was in Naples working on
the "Monster of Florence" case

73
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:03,680
and then I came here.

74
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,124
I opened my own detective agency and...

75
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:08,676
I think you know more about me now

76
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:11,407
than my own therapist.
Ls your turn.

77
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,762
You want to hear about me?

78
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:18,556
Im warning you, my life
isn't nearly as exciting as yours.

79
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,917
I was just hoping that...

80
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:25,286
we could set aside the formalities
and be a little more cordial.

81
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:27,597
We're having dinner.

82
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:32,596
Okay.

83
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,122
Tell me about the etchings
at the end

84
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:36,402
of the book.

85
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,444
I thought your job was clear.

86
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:41,557
Find a missing woman.

87
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,806
The other distractions are irrelevant.

88
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:48,244
And I thought you were obliged
to help me

89
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,682
- in any way you could.
- All right.

90
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,839
Anything to not have to listen
to you groan the whole way.

91
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,521
Les make a new deal.

92
00:06:56,687 --> 00:07:00,123
I'll tell you more about the past
if we focus on the present.

93
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,605
I want to hear how you plan
to continue investigating.

94
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:04,836
Great.

95
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:07,355
Ls a deal.

96
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:26,005
Where am I?

97
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,086
My head...

98
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:32,321
Is okay. You're safe.

99
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,679
My name is Selene.

100
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,878
You had quite a fall.

101
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:43,245
This area is full of ditches and caves,

102
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:45,238
but you were lucky.

103
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:47,403
Ls just a scratch.

104
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,844
But youre still weak.

105
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:53,837
I made you some lemon balm
and natural boldo.

106
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,164
It will make you strong again.

107
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,643
Please, don't trouble yourself.
I can't stay.

108
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:00,956
Go ahead.

109
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,359
Its five miles of forest
in every direction.

110
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:06,919
The only path

111
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:12,802
leads to a large abandoned house.

112
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:18,243
But youve already been there,
haven't you?

113
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:21,919
What do you want from me?

114
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:24,365
I don't have anything.

115
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:28,360
Don't be ridiculous.

116
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:30,085
What would I want from you?

117
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:32,283
If you leave, theyll find you.

118
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:36,037
And trust me, they won't be as nice.

119
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:39,802
- How do you know?
- That they're after you?

120
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,878
Because youre not the first.

121
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:46,606
But we'll make sure you're the last.

122
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:52,124
After the Valdemar tragedy,

123
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,926
Lazaro tried to get his life back.

124
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:00,515
But instead of managing
his fortune intelligently,

125
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:04,839
he invested all his capital
in a strange, forbidden book.

126
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:08,278
Sir, you havent eaten in days.

127
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:18,040
For Gods sake.

128
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:19,526
This can't go on.

129
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:23,077
What you're doing is blasphemy.
An abomination.

130
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:27,638
Ill end up having to bury her
somewhere else.

131
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,116
Get out of here.
Get out.

132
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:35,285
Sir, Ive served you
since you were a child.

133
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:38,557
I saw you grow up and become a man.

134
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:41,241
But you're a stranger to me now.

135
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,843
And you scare me just as much as

136
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:45,804
the room you made me board up.

137
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:47,606
Get out!

138
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,197
Yes, sir. I'll go.

139
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:52,719
But first I have one thing to say.

140
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,485
She chose to die with pride.

141
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,842
She sacrificed everything for you.

142
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,675
She devoted her last breaths to you.

143
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:04,963
Believe me, she wouldn't want to see

144
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:06,640
what you're turning into.

145
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:07,962
Get out of here.

146
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,278
I said get out.

147
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:14,606
Never speak her name again.

148
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,566
Never.

149
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:18,721
Yes, sir.

150
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm leaving.

151
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:25,800
She isn't dead.

152
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,725
You hear me, Jervas?

153
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,164
Leonor isn't dead!

154
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:38,402
I know what you mean.
The Necronomicon.

155
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,080
The Book of the Dead.

156
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:41,846
It has...

157
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:43,960
almost 10 pages about him.

158
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,242
Exactly.

159
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,401
He may have been persecuted
by the Church,

160
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,400
but he wasn't a Satanist
or anti-clerical.

161
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,446
His cult was based on the so-called
Great Old Ones,

162
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,439
Gods that precede any religion.

163
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:01,362
After searching for years,
he was finally

164
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,280
able to buy it from some merchants
in northern Iran.

165
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:08,884
What was never clear
is why he wanted it.

166
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:13,042
Maybe he had new plans
he thought it could help him with.

167
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:16,836
Right after that,
he regained his wealth and returned

168
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,599
to high society.

169
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:26,995
Hello!

170
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:38,961
Good evening.

171
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,846
Welcome. Good evening.

172
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:43,560
How are you?

173
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:44,842
Good evening.

174
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,801
Good evening.

175
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:53,803
I love the way you decorated.

176
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:55,002
Thank you.

177
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,476
Obviously a feminine touch.

178
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:02,721
If you'll excuse me...

179
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:04,002
Gentlemen.

180
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:09,602
Get your brother out of here.

181
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:14,365
How rude!

182
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:19,647
- Who is that?
- I dont know.

183
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:21,795
Lovecraft.

184
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:24,119
Come with me.

185
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:32,924
What are you doing here?
I don't recall inviting you.

186
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,486
Is that what bothers you,
or that I came?

187
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:37,716
What do you want?

188
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,560
Wherever I go...
Istanbul, Prague, Tehran...

189
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:44,436
Stop following me.
I'll never give you the Necronomicon.

190
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't want you to.
I'm not here to ask you for it,

191
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,805
but to free you from it.

192
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,879
Money is no object, of course.
I'll pay anything you ask.

193
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:56,881
The problem is, I have no intention
of parting with it.

194
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,526
Is that so?

195
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:03,837
Could I at least examine it?
Just for a moment.

196
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,281
Then I'll go.

197
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:44,723
Definitely the real thing.

198
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:47,799
One of a kind.

199
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,277
I lied to you.

200
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:55,363
I cant afford to buy it.
Not even a fraction of its value.

201
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:58,519
Ls no secret youre broke, Lovecraft.

202
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,084
Everyone knows that.

203
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:10,196
Then you also know I've dedicated
my life to studying the Necronomicon.

204
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:14,037
Many a careless person
thought he could use it

205
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:16,038
to make money.

206
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:17,720
Isn't that your case?

207
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:19,161
Not at all.

208
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,359
I shall be its only owner.

209
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:26,160
Utter foolishness, my dear friend.
Indeed it is the book

210
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,726
that owns you.

211
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:30,003
Before I leave,
here's some advice

212
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:33,125
about how to use it correctly.
There's a universal code

213
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,437
that equally affects
all the occult.

214
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:38,246
One simple rule.

215
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:42,437
The laws of Nature cannot be altered.

216
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,722
Please, allow me to demonstrate.

217
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:52,406
This is a simple levitation trick.

218
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,478
Yes, the book floats.

219
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:58,279
But it is bound by
the forces of Nature: Gravity

220
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:01,325
and weight remain.

221
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:02,556
And yes,

222
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,525
it is enshrouded by magic,
but its effect is exclusive.

223
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,598
Gravity, the essence of Nature,

224
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,803
can never disappear.

225
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,276
When the spell wears off

226
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:17,599
the book once again
depends on its own weight.

227
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,321
Very good.

228
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,685
Thanks for the trick.

229
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:26,805
Trust me, I've seen
more spectacular displays.

230
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,400
Now please return the book to me.

231
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:32,803
I've been far too tolerant with you.

232
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:38,961
Incredible.

233
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:42,239
You offer advice
and end up lecturing me.

234
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:43,960
Enough is enough.

235
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:50,119
Please leave my home.

236
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:52,957
- I have guests to attend to.
- How odd.

237
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,164
You're just like the others.

238
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,476
You neither listen nor learn.

239
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:02,523
You're oblivious to the forces you're
dealing with, and you don't care.

240
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:07,884
This isn't mysticism,
is demonology.

241
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,042
No one,

242
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:13,723
absolutely no one who has handled
that book has survived.

243
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:17,520
Ive warned you a thousand times
and you always

244
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:20,121
reject me, making things
more complicated.

245
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:23,359
Mysteries and secrets
are everything to you.

246
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:27,042
- Secrets and mysteries.
- They aren't the same thing?

247
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:28,921
No.

248
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,836
Absolutely not. Mysteries

249
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:35,678
are wonders that can be pondered
and shared.

250
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:39,920
Secrets are a heavy burden
people carry by themselves.

251
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:46,718
Thas your problem.
A heavy burden on your shoulders.

252
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:53,723
Ls nothing compared
to whas in store for you.

253
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,361
Nothing!

254
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:03,280
- Any luck?
- Were you listening?

255
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,518
I was praying quietly,

256
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:12,004
asking God to restore sanity
to all this.

257
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:18,838
You must be Jervas,
the man who wrote to me

258
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,043
these last months
and asked me to come.

259
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,276
Yes.

260
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:24,961
Please forgive my boldness,

261
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:27,603
but you're my last hope.

262
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:31,444
I told my master
not to bother with all this,

263
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:33,484
that all this fear was unnecessary.

264
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:35,316
But...

265
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,000
I can't get through to him.

266
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:38,641
Ive never seen him like this.

267
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,604
He rejected the help of his friends

268
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:44,759
and took refuge in the comfort
of the unknown.

269
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:50,566
Then there will be plenty to fear.
I warned him, in any case.

270
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:53,522
There is a great deal at stake.

271
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:57,961
Hes lucky to have
a guardian angel like yourself.

272
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,996
But he must see the fine line
between perseverance

273
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,159
and sheer stupidity.

274
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,644
I'm sorry, sir.

275
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,357
Good evening.

276
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,284
Thank you, Mr. Lovecraft.

277
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:16,641
Goodbye.

278
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,561
- They didn't hit it off.
- No.

279
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:26,524
Oddly enough, because Lazaro
was the best of hosts.

280
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:29,117
He treated his guests exquisitely.

281
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,637
Then what happened?
How did it end?

282
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:35,797
You think we'd be here
if it were over?

283
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,557
Nothing will happen to you.

284
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:40,285
What is that?

285
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:43,958
I'm sorry, I'm pretty skeptical
about this stuff.

286
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:48,120
You don't need to believe,
but I must understand.

287
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,520
Choose seven cards.

288
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:57,444
There are three parts to Tarot:
Recent past,

289
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,323
present and immediate future.

290
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,517
Each part determines the next.

291
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:09,202
The first thing we need to see
is your recent past.

292
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,605
It marks the tone of the questioner.

293
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:16,446
Intelligence over

294
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,997
brute force, morality,

295
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,520
tranquility.

296
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:24,162
Continue.

297
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:28,436
The second card

298
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,359
shows your situation

299
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,119
in the recent past.

300
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,604
- The house.
- It means the end

301
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,076
of fortune, adversity,

302
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:40,159
chaos, professional issues.

303
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:46,316
Four days ago I was called to value
an old house, thas when it all began.

304
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:47,442
Not yet.

305
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,445
Dont tell me anything yet.

306
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:52,480
Pick up the third card.

307
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:02,361
People who have influenced you lately.

308
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:05,558
Acts of evil,

309
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,964
hatred, perversion.

310
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,725
It all coincides, doesn't it?

311
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:14,359
- Yes.
- Good.

312
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:16,040
Now you must tell me everything,

313
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:17,720
from the beginning.

314
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:21,400
Our stop.

315
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:36,159
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

316
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:37,077
Let me see.

317
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:44,760
It doesnt look bad.

318
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:48,635
Trust me, Ive twisted my ankle
a hundred times.

319
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:53,443
- Does it hurt to put weight on it?
- No.

320
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:55,802
Well?

321
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:00,078
Are you taking advantage
to get closer to me?

322
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:06,157
No first names,
but I can stroke your leg?

323
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:08,003
Fine.

324
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,484
No problem.
So what do we do now?

325
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,197
There's nobody around.
Except him.

326
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:21,645
Well walk, is not far.

327
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:39,285
The next day, I woke up
in a strange boarding house.

328
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:42,640
No telephone, no explanations, nothing.

329
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:46,081
So I tried to find a ride into town.

330
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:55,836
Hello?

331
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,400
Is anybody here?

332
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:12,200
Damaso, don't be angry.

333
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,320
It really hurts.

334
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:16,079
You scared me.

335
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,566
I thought I was alone.

336
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:19,758
I thought you were Damaso.

337
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,240
What are you doing here?

338
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:25,716
I was looking for a ride into town.

339
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:29,965
I think the car keys
are around here.

340
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,196
Thank you.

341
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,766
What are all these photographs?

342
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:45,435
People who have been through here.

343
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:49,876
I collect them.
They were all friends of mine.

344
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:53,843
There are 180 in all.

345
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:58,117
All friends of yours?

346
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:00,880
Thas a whole lot.

347
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:03,605
Yeah, 180.

348
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:05,166
Nice number, huh?

349
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:07,835
It sure is.

350
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:11,884
Trust me, numbers are important.

351
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:13,762
We all have one.

352
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,798
If you give me a photo,
I'll post it.

353
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:21,924
You'd be number 181.

354
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:24,321
What about these children?

355
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:26,515
They're police photos.

356
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,636
Missing people, hikers.

357
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:37,604
The rough terrain. Ls easy
to get lost around here. Look.

358
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:42,398
I volunteer for search parties.

359
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:47,357
Sometimes the police come and study them
to help with their cases.

360
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:50,202
All these missing people...

361
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:53,480
I can't believe this hasnt gotten out.

362
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,003
Have you called the press?

363
00:23:56,927 --> 00:23:58,326
What for?

364
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:00,765
What do you mean?
To investigate.

365
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:03,805
They have no respect for anything
or anyone.

366
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:06,800
- No, but...
- Yeah, they've been here.

367
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:09,602
All they do is lie and make up stuff.

368
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,723
They don't care what happens.

369
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:15,482
They just want an excuse
to snoop around inside the house.

370
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:17,966
Shit...

371
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,246
Are you okay?

372
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:28,602
Yeah, sometimes my head...

373
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:32,685
What about them wanting
to get in the house?

374
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:35,843
Do you think maybe they already have?

375
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,758
- Don't you think?
- What?

376
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:40,999
Something may have happened to them.

377
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,635
If they minded their own business,
nothing would.

378
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:46,963
The fucking keys are gone.

379
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,806
Whas the problem?

380
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,480
I don't understand.
You've been nice to me,

381
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:53,161
- why not to them?
- Ls different.

382
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,280
You came here to work,

383
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:59,085
not to meddle.
You asked permission,

384
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,044
treated me with respect,
you were nice.

385
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:05,444
The others are fucking brats.
They don't give a shit.

386
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:08,485
I'm glad what happened did,
they deserved it.

387
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,799
What do you mean?

388
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:12,321
What happened to them?

389
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:15,722
Youre smart.

390
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,002
Take a guess.

391
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:19,482
No...

392
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:21,405
Thas impossible.

393
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:22,761
If something had happened to them

394
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:24,997
they would have found remains.

395
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:27,716
Bodies dont disappear just like that.

396
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:32,283
And the leftovers of the chicken
you ate last night?

397
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:37,435
Where are they?

398
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:48,162
Whas the matter?
What is it?

399
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:51,605
I didn't take my medicine.

400
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,962
I need my hearing aid.

401
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,798
My ears ring constantly.

402
00:25:57,487 --> 00:26:00,001
You'll find something for the pain
in that cupboard.

403
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:03,682
And for the voices.

404
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:08,166
Take any of them.

405
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:11,047
The ones in the white bottle
calm me down.

406
00:26:12,127 --> 00:26:14,118
These are for animals.

407
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:15,356
Give me the fucking pills!

408
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:20,596
No!

409
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:24,439
Dont take them!
What are you doing?

410
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:27,326
- You want to kill yourself?
- Dont shout at me!

411
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:31,082
You know what you just took?
These could kill you.

412
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:33,283
They're for animals, for horses!

413
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:35,242
God...

414
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,161
No.

415
00:27:07,087 --> 00:27:08,486
What did you say?

416
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:12,645
Tell her the truth.

417
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:15,879
I said no at first.

418
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:19,598
But they made me eat them
during my initiation.

419
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,275
You can't imagine the feeling
when you taste them.

420
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:26,404
I dont know what you mean.

421
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:29,320
Ls only sometimes.

422
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:31,080
When he doesnt want them.

423
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:33,875
They make me.

424
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,363
What happened to all those children?

425
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,360
I couldn't help it.

426
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:45,004
Their meat has no fat,

427
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:47,201
or poison.

428
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:48,635
I mean...

429
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:50,885
adults...

430
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,000
aren't bad,

431
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:54,839
but children...

432
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,366
Children are caviar.

433
00:28:02,887 --> 00:28:04,206
You shouldnt have come here.

434
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:08,155
They'll hurt you just like the others.
They'll feed you to it and then to me.

435
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:10,877
You must leave!
Hurry!

436
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:21,076
You had to screw it up, didn't you?

437
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:23,360
This is important!

438
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:25,886
I've told you a thousand times.

439
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:29,515
Talk, talk, talk!

440
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:34,324
You know what happens to people
who talk too much?

441
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,446
What do you want?
To know why she's here?

442
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:54,236
She knows about the party.
Everyone does!

443
00:28:56,687 --> 00:28:59,963
The fat guy told me.
So you know what's at stake.

444
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:17,565
What happened?

445
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:20,046
It was Damaso.

446
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:22,846
Oh my God, darling.
We're so sorry.

447
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:27,319
You can't go on like this.
How many times has it been?

448
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:30,079
Telling the truth isn't cowardly.

449
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:32,807
You know hes not allowed to hurt you.

450
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:36,000
This is the last time, I swear.

451
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,279
I'm going to stand up to him.

452
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:40,244
No, you arent.

453
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:44,235
Not until you admit what you are
and face up to it.

454
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:46,719
Its time to stop being a child.

455
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:51,358
To grow up, not just get back
at that bastard.

456
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:55,918
You have to change your behavior,
be smarter than him.

457
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:58,882
Beat him at his own game.

458
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:02,407
You know what you're doing
isn't right.

459
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:05,116
We've talked about it many times.

460
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:09,437
This is your big chance
to redeem yourself.

461
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:13,085
Shes your main concern now.

462
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:15,000
She's been locked up for two days.

463
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,317
Remember what happened yesterday?

464
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:21,005
What do you want from me?

465
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,965
You didnt help her, you backed out.
That can't happen again.

466
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,119
You have to help her, free her.

467
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:29,158
Remember how she treated you?

468
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:32,037
Does she deserve what she has coming?

469
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:34,005
Ls true, she doesn't.

470
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,158
Act fast, while he's napping.

471
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:38,045
We're running out of time.

472
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:41,523
Go and then tell us everything.

473
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:44,201
Okay, I will.

474
00:30:45,607 --> 00:30:48,201
Santi, look at me.

475
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:53,085
Before you leave, I want the little boy
to close his eyes...

476
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:56,920
and the man to open them again.

477
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:22,485
You can do it, Santiago.

478
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:26,797
Finish him off!
Kill him!

479
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,322
Carve him up

480
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:31,636
into little pieces!

481
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:38,486
Were proud of you.

482
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:40,996
Now youre acting like a man.

483
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,920
I have something for you
before you leave.

484
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,606
Shit!

485
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:54,040
It was my second day in captivity,
when suddenly...

486
00:32:58,527 --> 00:32:59,880
What do you want?

487
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:01,686
Let me out!

488
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,246
Ls okay. Its me,

489
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:05,796
- Santi.
- Santi, please.

490
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:07,082
Get me out of here.

491
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:08,646
Keep quiet.

492
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:11,196
Damaso is downstairs.
Listen to me.

493
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,323
Ill help you,
but I don't have the key.

494
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:15,918
So we have to pick the lock.

495
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,805
I already tried, but I couldnt.

496
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,164
Find a wire or a hair pin.

497
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:21,442
A wire?

498
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:24,480
Theres nothing in here.

499
00:33:33,407 --> 00:33:34,726
I havent got anything.

500
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:36,804
Look under the bed.

501
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:38,639
Under the bed.

502
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:40,795
The springs.

503
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:28,880
After the house, I fled through
the forest until I reached a road.

504
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:32,484
But I almost got run over by a car.

505
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:37,241
I know I fell on the asphalt,
but I was so dazed

506
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:39,363
I couldnt recognize the driver.

507
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:43,324
I managed to get away,
but I fell in a ditch.

508
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,041
The rest you know.

509
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:47,926
The rest is the present.

510
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,965
Its a bridge card that links
to the immediate future.

511
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,725
The wheel of fortune.

512
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,166
Upside down.

513
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:04,001
What is it?

514
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:05,316
Is something wrong?

515
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:09,164
I see sudden changes.

516
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:10,601
Unfavorable,

517
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:12,121
dangerous.

518
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:15,278
I think you should go.

519
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:17,880
They need you there.

520
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,203
Where? At the house?

521
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:24,037
Did you hear a word I said?

522
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:26,835
Wait a minute.

523
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,278
Of course.
You're one of them!

524
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:32,403
All this was just to keep me here,

525
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:33,716
- to gain time.
- No, no.

526
00:35:33,887 --> 00:35:35,366
Thats not it, I swear.

527
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:36,880
I swear.

528
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,763
I see it all clearly in the cards.

529
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:43,005
Let me explain.

530
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:46,116
They...

531
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:49,085
the same ones, they drugged me

532
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:51,645
and stole my baby.

533
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,761
My son!

534
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:00,763
Thas why I said you werent the first.

535
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,887
You have no idea
what they're capable of.

536
00:36:06,487 --> 00:36:09,445
I gave birth to my baby here.
By myself!

537
00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:11,840
I tried to protect him,

538
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:16,481
but they found out about him
and there was nothing I could do.

539
00:36:16,647 --> 00:36:18,797
I was terrified.

540
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,316
I know hes still alive.
Please.

541
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:25,078
I'm not going back.
But I promise...

542
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:28,045
I can't walk, but I can guide you.

543
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:30,801
There's a safe path,
it only takes an hour.

544
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:32,446
I need to know he's okay.

545
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:36,676
I can't help you.
I can't even help myself.

546
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:41,316
But youre in time. They still haven't
got the amount they need.

547
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:50,403
What if I tell you a secret about
what they were going to do to you?

548
00:36:51,247 --> 00:36:52,600
What are you talking about?

549
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:55,725
Listen to me, sweetie.

550
00:36:56,367 --> 00:37:00,155
Listen carefully
because your life is at stake.

551
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,487
You're not here by chance.

552
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:06,279
First let me say...

553
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:09,362
Is them! They've found me...

554
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:26,920
There's nobody here.

555
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:28,886
The light is on, but...

556
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:35,677
- Are you crazy?
- Who are you? What do you want?

557
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:37,646
Calm down!

558
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:39,924
We were looking for a hotel.
We got lost

559
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,725
and we saw the light on.

560
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:45,760
Put that down.

561
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,235
Wait a minute.
You're Luisa Llorente.

562
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,079
I can't believe we found you.

563
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:54,761
Everybodys looking for you.
We thought you were missing.

564
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:57,162
Listen, is okay.

565
00:37:57,327 --> 00:38:00,160
Were from the foundation.
I'm Nora Cervia, the president.

566
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:02,355
And he's a cop, look.

567
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:07,796
You see?

568
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:10,526
Thank God!

569
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:12,162
Ls over.

570
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:16,365
Is that better?

571
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,082
Good.

572
00:38:18,327 --> 00:38:21,444
Help me wake him up
and we'll figure out what to do.

573
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:23,279
Please, we have to leave.

574
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:25,119
We need to wake him up first.

575
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:31,240
He won't wake up.

576
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:34,319
Im sorry, Im really upset.

577
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,320
Wake up!

578
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:40,605
Come on... Please, react.

579
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:03,639
Olympus calling Mars, over.

580
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:07,081
This is Mars, over.

581
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:10,125
- Everything okay? Over.
- I can't complain.

582
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:14,197
My first time in the woods
and I've caught two prize specimens.

583
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,082
By the way, did one get away?

584
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:20,080
Curly blond hair, blue shirt.
Over.

585
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:22,443
You've got Luisa?
Thank God.

586
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,240
That fool Santiago let her go.

587
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:28,559
Wait till I get my hands on him.
I owe you one. Over.

588
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,158
Remind me to collect.

589
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:33,802
And don't you dare hurt Santi,
you hear me?

590
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,605
He has to be there.

591
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:37,926
We'll clear things up later.

592
00:39:38,447 --> 00:39:40,961
Ill give you my position,
come and find me.

593
00:39:41,287 --> 00:39:43,721
We have to carry these two.
Over and out.

594
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:57,756
Santi!

595
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:01,041
I have a girl here with me
asking for you.

596
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:03,915
She stopped by to say hello.

597
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:08,803
Santiago, sweetie. It's me, Nora.
Please, come and say hi.

598
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:18,446
Its about time.
Where have you been?

599
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:21,003
You shouldn't keep a lady waiting.

600
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:22,242
Santi.

601
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:25,877
What's wrong?
Don't you want to say hello?

602
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:27,116
And I thought

603
00:40:27,287 --> 00:40:30,836
we were friends.
You're not even happy to see me?

604
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:33,726
Hello, Nora.
Nice to hear your voice.

605
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:35,042
Finally.

606
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,406
I thought you were avoiding me.
Listen.

607
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:42,642
I'll find the boss to get things ready
and I'll see you soon.

608
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,523
Big kiss. Bye.

609
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:49,802
Out.

610
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:53,237
I knew you'd come out
if you heard her voice.

611
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:56,281
Thas the problem
with a broken hearing aid.

612
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,355
You can't tell a walkie-talkie
from real sound.

613
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:03,476
Why did you say there was a girl
asking for me?

614
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:05,160
Because there is.

615
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:13,076
Please, don't hurt her.
I'm begging you.

616
00:41:13,927 --> 00:41:17,602
Of course not.
Were going to be great friends.

617
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:19,642
Ls okay.

618
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:22,682
Everything will be fine, I promise.

619
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:29,086
You're lucky I was specifically told
not to touch you.

620
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:32,319
But I want you to know what will happen
if you screw me again.

621
00:41:32,527 --> 00:41:33,960
Please, anything you want.

622
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:36,080
It won't happen again.

623
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:38,158
Please, don't hurt her.
Leave her alone.

624
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:41,524
The things I've had to put up with
over the years.

625
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:43,236
Youve never told me

626
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:46,166
about the raunchy stuff

627
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:48,887
you do. Anyway,

628
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:53,198
people are into different things.
I can admit that.

629
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:56,079
But I will not tolerate

630
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:59,002
being made a fool of
in front of them.

631
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:09,837
Santi, Santi, Santi.

632
00:42:22,127 --> 00:42:24,197
I suggest you do the right thing.

633
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:27,286
Because the next head to roll
won't be plastic.

634
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:31,367
Youd better be ready
to do your job.

635
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:28,366
Wake up.

636
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:31,639
Its okay, is okay.

637
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:35,475
No sudden moves.
Theyre loose.

638
00:43:35,887 --> 00:43:37,240
Get your hand loose.

639
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,800
Where are we and who are you?

640
00:43:44,967 --> 00:43:47,117
I'm a cop. Do you know her?

641
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:52,606
Ana, wake up.

642
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:54,439
Is she Luisa Llorente?
The valuer?

643
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:55,676
Yes.

644
00:43:56,807 --> 00:43:57,956
Luisa.

645
00:43:58,687 --> 00:44:00,040
Luisa, wake up.

646
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:03,156
Ana, come on, wake up.

647
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:07,766
Ls okay.

648
00:44:08,927 --> 00:44:10,121
Don't be frightened.

649
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:23,598
This room belongs to a sadist.

650
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:26,286
Im Nicolas Tramel.

651
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:27,926
I'm a detective.

652
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,955
And I've seen this before.
Though never like this,

653
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,719
with so many people.

654
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:35,919
This is what we call his playroom.
Somebody

655
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:38,006
scares the victims

656
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:40,723
and makes them beg.

657
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:42,966
Then they record the moment.

658
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:46,805
If you look closely,
the bars and chains are fake.

659
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:48,320
They create false hope

660
00:44:48,487 --> 00:44:50,637
and they can play
over and over again.

661
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:55,166
A taser gun.

662
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:58,076
Ls charged.

663
00:44:58,247 --> 00:45:00,078
Why are we here?
What is this place?

664
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:03,036
This must be the basement
of the Valdemar mansion.

665
00:45:03,207 --> 00:45:04,401
How do you know?

666
00:45:04,687 --> 00:45:05,915
Because I was valuing the house.

667
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:07,202
Why lock us in?

668
00:45:07,927 --> 00:45:09,280
They didn't lock us in.

669
00:45:09,447 --> 00:45:10,846
They kidnapped us.

670
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:12,476
What do you mean?

671
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:13,875
How do you know?

672
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:15,844
Because I disappeared four days ago.

673
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:17,801
And they locked me up,

674
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:20,527
among other things.
So I know what I'm talking about.

675
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:21,762
God!

676
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:24,158
- Who did that to you?
- Damaso.

677
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:26,557
The guy who locked us in here.

678
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:28,638
And trust me, this is nothing

679
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:30,320
compared to the rest of the place.

680
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:32,921
- The day I got here I found...
- Luisa, excuse me.

681
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:35,317
Tell us your adventures
some other time.

682
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,358
- We need to get out of here.
- Yeah, but how?

683
00:45:40,327 --> 00:45:43,956
Okay, everybody calm down.
We don't know what they want from us.

684
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:47,966
All I know is
I was sent here by your boss,

685
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:49,480
Maximilian Colvin.

686
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,917
So I suggest we try
to figure this out together.

687
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:57,005
At least that way we'll be ready
for whatever happens.

688
00:45:57,327 --> 00:45:58,362
All right?

689
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,123
You mean were somehow
involved in all this?

690
00:46:01,687 --> 00:46:03,006
Yeah, but how?

691
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:07,037
The only thing we have in common
is we work together

692
00:46:07,207 --> 00:46:08,925
valuing historic estates.

693
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:11,757
Besides, our supervisor is missing.

694
00:46:11,927 --> 00:46:13,201
Orquicia isnt here.

695
00:46:13,927 --> 00:46:15,645
- Pablo is dead.
- What?

696
00:46:16,047 --> 00:46:17,162
What do you mean, dead?

697
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:20,076
I found him in the house.
Dismembered.

698
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:21,441
Please!

699
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:24,716
What about you?

700
00:46:25,847 --> 00:46:26,802
You act like you knew him.

701
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:29,286
What does that matter?

702
00:46:29,447 --> 00:46:31,403
There's still no link between us.

703
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:34,001
Well, there is now.

704
00:47:11,487 --> 00:47:13,443
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, sir.

705
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:15,677
Everything is going
according to plan.

706
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:39,156
No.

707
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:41,365
How could I be so stupid?

708
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:44,356
When they told me about the case

709
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:48,003
they accidentally mentioned
Orquicia was missing.

710
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:51,159
I tried to find out more,
but they gave me the run around

711
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,919
and I got sidetracked.

712
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:56,125
Hours of myths and legends
on the train,

713
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:58,801
all just to keep me
from solving your case.

714
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:00,480
Can you get to the point?

715
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:01,676
Yeah.

716
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:07,205
A few months ago, Pablo and I
discovered that Inmoberance

717
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:11,201
was making a series of large
undetected money transfers.

718
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:15,440
They were so irregular
we thought we could set ourselves up

719
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:17,040
with a piece of the action.

720
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:21,405
The amount was always the same,
one million euros,

721
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:24,843
reaching a total
of more than 650 million euros,

722
00:48:25,047 --> 00:48:26,685
ready to be transferred.

723
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:28,075
All we needed

724
00:48:28,247 --> 00:48:29,885
was a plate to duplicate

725
00:48:30,047 --> 00:48:32,959
the seal used on company documents.

726
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,596
Then, after the summer,

727
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:40,160
we found part of the plate,
but Pablo

728
00:48:42,327 --> 00:48:44,682
lost interest and said that...

729
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,164
he had come across something
much bigger,

730
00:48:48,327 --> 00:48:50,158
something much better than money.

731
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,757
He never told me what it was.

732
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:54,560
And I never heard from him again.

733
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:55,876
Until today.

734
00:48:56,807 --> 00:48:58,320
After the summer.

735
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:02,325
Thas when we were in a meeting
and that guy showed up.

736
00:49:03,647 --> 00:49:04,875
Remember?

737
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:06,805
A strange man walked in

738
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:09,561
and said we needed to value
the Valdemar mansion

739
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:10,955
as soon as possible.

740
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,726
Orquicia volunteered

741
00:49:12,887 --> 00:49:15,355
and named us as his support team.

742
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:19,719
Wait a minute. This is all about
you two trying to embezzle money?

743
00:49:19,887 --> 00:49:22,196
Take it easy.
And don't point at me.

744
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:26,076
What we had in mind
never got past the planning stage.

745
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:28,317
Yeah, and what about the plates?

746
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:30,319
The fat guy was capable of anything.

747
00:49:30,487 --> 00:49:34,082
And involving us to get rid of him
isn't that far-fetched.

748
00:49:34,247 --> 00:49:37,956
Yeah, right. First of all, the fat guy
had a name, and it was Pablo.

749
00:49:38,127 --> 00:49:40,561
Have the decency to not insult him
in the grave.

750
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,955
Leave me alone!

751
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:46,245
First somebody tell me how the hell
they found out about something

752
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:48,637
that we were only considering.

753
00:49:48,807 --> 00:49:51,685
I cant believe Im here
because of a couple of schmucks!

754
00:49:51,847 --> 00:49:53,326
Take it easy!

755
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:54,715
Don't even talk to her.

756
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:03,637
Stop it! We all got each other
into this, like a vicious circle.

757
00:50:04,727 --> 00:50:06,797
You, detective, got Orquicia into it,

758
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:09,436
who involved us
by naming us as his team.

759
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:12,476
We sent Luisa to value the house,

760
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:16,196
and when she went missing,
you were hired to find her.

761
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:19,035
Fuck!

762
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:24,279
Santiago.
Santi, is me, Luisa.

763
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:25,921
What are you doing?

764
00:50:26,087 --> 00:50:27,964
- What if hes one of them?
- He is.

765
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:31,996
He helped me before.
But my adventures

766
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:33,646
- were boring you.
- Stop it.

767
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:35,081
Some of us
want to get out of here.

768
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:37,122
Santiago,

769
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:38,606
can you hear me?

770
00:50:38,767 --> 00:50:40,644
Luisa. They caught you again?

771
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:43,603
Yeah, I'm afraid they caught us all.

772
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:45,120
Then we haven't got much time.

773
00:50:45,287 --> 00:50:46,242
Can you open the door?

774
00:50:46,407 --> 00:50:48,523
Yes, I can.

775
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:50,485
But if I do, I want you to do

776
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,365
- something for me.
- Anything.

777
00:50:53,287 --> 00:50:54,322
Okay.

778
00:50:54,487 --> 00:50:58,162
Here's the deal. I'll open the door
and show you the way to Luisa's car.

779
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:02,320
In return, you have to take
someone else with you.

780
00:51:02,487 --> 00:51:03,886
Someone else?

781
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,598
There are more people locked up.

782
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:07,922
Promise me.

783
00:51:09,287 --> 00:51:11,084
- Okay, we promise.
- Anything.

784
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:13,438
You promised.
You can't take it back.

785
00:51:14,367 --> 00:51:15,482
Who is this kid?

786
00:51:17,647 --> 00:51:18,841
Thank you, Santi!

787
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,562
I'm not a kid, I'm a man.

788
00:51:23,607 --> 00:51:25,006
I can't see anything.

789
00:51:25,687 --> 00:51:26,961
- Here.
- Thank you.

790
00:51:35,687 --> 00:51:36,722
Lets go.

791
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:38,764
You promised.
You said you'd help.

792
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:41,999
Fuck the promise.
I'm getting out of here.

793
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:44,920
Eduardo, have you any idea
what Santiago is risking for us?

794
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:48,558
No, I don't. What I do know
is his friends locked us up.

795
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:52,037
I have no one to thank
for trying to escape.

796
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:54,085
Wait a minute.

797
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:55,999
- Come on. This way?
- Yes.

798
00:51:56,607 --> 00:51:59,167
- Whas wrong?
- I dont want to leave the group.

799
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:01,286
Or you either.

800
00:52:03,927 --> 00:52:04,882
Come on.

801
00:52:05,767 --> 00:52:06,722
Honey.

802
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:10,202
Lets go.
Come on, quick.

803
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:20,522
Okay, Santiago.
Thats your name, right?

804
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:23,924
Santiago. I'm Nicolas.
Now tell me.

805
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:25,645
Who's coming with us?

806
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:28,083
Someone very special.
You're about to meet him.

807
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:30,045
Yeah, sure. He must be.

808
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:35,886
Hold on a minute.

809
00:52:38,407 --> 00:52:40,284
I did some bad things.

810
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:44,758
I was ordered to kidnap a baby.

811
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:46,680
What are you talking about?

812
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:51,201
When I said no,
Damaso broke something in my ear.

813
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:55,600
The gypsys baby?
What did you do with him? Where is he?

814
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:57,479
He's downstairs sleeping.

815
00:52:57,647 --> 00:52:59,399
This guys a fucking wacko.

816
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:01,319
Take it easy, okay?
Calm down.

817
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,523
He's our only way out of here.

818
00:53:03,687 --> 00:53:07,043
And were still in time to stop
something terrible from happening.

819
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:08,686
I know you hate me.

820
00:53:08,847 --> 00:53:12,999
But I stole him and hid him myself
to protect him from Damaso.

821
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:15,362
The baby had better be okay.

822
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,762
Go on.

823
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:19,165
I said move it!

824
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:20,926
And dont turn around.

825
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:22,765
Don't look at me, weirdo!

826
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:24,966
Ana, give me your hand.

827
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,600
We're not going the right way.

828
00:53:28,927 --> 00:53:30,326
How do you know?

829
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:33,764
You... That way?

830
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,526
Were going that way?

831
00:53:35,927 --> 00:53:38,521
Are you fucking nuts?
The exit is the other way.

832
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:41,201
No, we're close.
Ls down there.

833
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:43,198
Then we'll go out the other side.

834
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:45,801
How? I dont remember any back doors
in the plans.

835
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:49,323
There's a cave under the mansion
with an exit to the outside.

836
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:51,682
- Im not going in a cave.
- Me neither.

837
00:53:51,847 --> 00:53:56,398
Ls less than a mile long
and it opens out into a clearing.

838
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:58,326
Ls the best short cut.

839
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:01,361
If you want, we can turn around
and cross the mansion.

840
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:03,563
- We have no choice.
- You believe him?

841
00:54:03,727 --> 00:54:05,877
- What choice do we have?
- Les go.

842
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:07,526
- Follow him.
- Move it.

843
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:11,802
Come on!

844
00:54:20,807 --> 00:54:22,126
Wait here.

845
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:38,204
They ordered me to keep him here.

846
00:54:40,927 --> 00:54:42,042
I know is wrong

847
00:54:43,247 --> 00:54:45,636
and his mothers
probably looking for him.

848
00:54:48,567 --> 00:54:51,081
I don't know anything about babies.

849
00:54:52,847 --> 00:54:54,519
But I did the best I could.

850
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:56,925
You have to take him with you.

851
00:54:57,247 --> 00:54:58,441
Crazy son of a bitch!

852
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:02,680
- We're following this guy?
- You know the way out?

853
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:04,519
- Calm down!
- Shut up!

854
00:55:05,047 --> 00:55:07,277
You don't, do you?
We have no choice.

855
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:09,122
Yes, we do.

856
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,080
Let him help us.

857
00:55:11,247 --> 00:55:13,238
Okay, we have no choice.

858
00:55:14,727 --> 00:55:16,445
Okay, well take him.

859
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:18,245
But you show us the way out.

860
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,522
Come on, les go.

861
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:23,403
Thank you. Thank you all.

862
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:30,719
Santiago, do you know why
they locked us up?

863
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:33,762
They don't tell me, but I can imagine.

864
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:36,725
Is it related
to them stealing the baby?

865
00:55:37,487 --> 00:55:39,523
- I dont want to scare you.
- Enough nonsense.

866
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,917
Ls because these two bozos
tried to rob them.

867
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:45,318
You're getting on my nerves. I told you,
theres no way they could know.

868
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:47,364
- Of course not.
- Quiet!

869
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:50,402
We're entering the cave.

870
00:55:51,487 --> 00:55:55,002
For your own good,
remain completely silent.

871
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:57,997
Trust me, you dont want to wake up
what sleeps in here.

872
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:01,076
Thanks for suggesting this route.

873
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,878
Ls the fastest and safest,
except for

874
00:56:07,047 --> 00:56:08,241
total boneheads!

875
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:09,875
Typical troublemakers.

876
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:14,245
You never follow instructions.
Give me the flashlight, I'll lead.

877
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:17,156
- Give it to him.
- Take the fucking flashlight.

878
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:20,125
Take the baby. Careful.

879
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:25,442
What bullshit.

880
00:56:56,727 --> 00:56:57,716
Come on!

881
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:17,600
Here... your baby.

882
00:57:18,287 --> 00:57:19,686
Give me the flashlight.

883
00:57:20,047 --> 00:57:21,241
Come on.

884
00:57:26,807 --> 00:57:28,035
Quick, run!

885
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:30,523
Luisa!

886
00:57:30,887 --> 00:57:31,717
Luisa!

887
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:47,522
Jump!

888
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,040
Come on, come on!

889
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:03,562
Hurry!

890
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:04,917
That way...

891
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,201
Come on, Eduardo!

892
00:58:24,487 --> 00:58:25,715
I think is gone.

893
00:58:28,647 --> 00:58:29,443
Eduardo!

894
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:30,722
Help!

895
00:58:35,287 --> 00:58:36,402
The gun.

896
00:58:37,087 --> 00:58:38,315
Please, help me!

897
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:48,197
- Eduardo!
- Ana!

898
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:50,039
Ana, no! Come on!

899
00:58:52,567 --> 00:58:53,556
Calm down.

900
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:55,844
- What was that?
- I don't know, I swear.

901
00:58:56,007 --> 00:58:58,965
- What the fuck was that?
- They never tell me anything.

902
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:01,038
What? You're the one who warned us.

903
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:04,961
Seriously, they never tell me anything.
But sometimes Damaso feeds it.

904
00:59:05,127 --> 00:59:07,482
- What does he feed it?
- Let me go.

905
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:10,196
Ana.

906
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:11,796
Listen to me!

907
00:59:12,247 --> 00:59:14,761
We need you here, okay?
Come on.

908
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:17,845
We have to go,
the batteries won't last.

909
00:59:18,007 --> 00:59:19,520
Come on, les go.

910
00:59:23,247 --> 00:59:24,316
Come on.

911
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:46,717
Careful.

912
00:59:57,647 --> 00:59:58,716
Come on.

913
01:00:02,247 --> 01:00:03,839
Luisa, wheres your flashlight?

914
01:00:04,527 --> 01:00:06,358
- I dont have it.
- What do you mean?

915
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:08,320
I don't know where it is.

916
01:00:08,807 --> 01:00:11,116
- You left it behind?
- I dont know, okay?

917
01:00:11,847 --> 01:00:13,166
What is this?

918
01:00:26,287 --> 01:00:27,322
Whas she doing?

919
01:00:27,727 --> 01:00:28,921
Where are you going?

920
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:30,762
Ana!

921
01:00:32,287 --> 01:00:34,278
Ana! Ana!

922
01:00:39,647 --> 01:00:40,557
Move.

923
01:00:44,127 --> 01:00:45,401
Theres a way out.

924
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:52,679
Sir! They're here!

925
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:56,397
Come on, les go.

926
01:00:56,647 --> 01:00:58,285
Thas enough bait!

927
01:00:58,527 --> 01:00:59,755
Come on, move it.

928
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,920
Come on!

929
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:03,322
Quickly!

930
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:05,395
Move it.

931
01:01:06,927 --> 01:01:08,121
Quickly!

932
01:01:13,887 --> 01:01:16,117
Max, what the fuck is this?

933
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:18,320
Everything in due time.

934
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:20,202
Please.

935
01:01:21,007 --> 01:01:23,567
Cooperate and nothing
will happen to you.

936
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:26,597
Santiago, please.

937
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:32,083
Good dog, good dog.

938
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:34,921
Maximilian.

939
01:01:35,287 --> 01:01:36,959
I know you think we were stealing

940
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:39,038
from you, but we weren't.
You were wrong

941
01:01:39,207 --> 01:01:40,481
all along.

942
01:01:41,007 --> 01:01:42,360
What are you talking about?

943
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:44,515
The money.

944
01:01:44,687 --> 01:01:48,521
We know about the 661 million
you were hording.

945
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:53,359
Who else is aware

946
01:01:54,287 --> 01:01:55,515
of that figure?

947
01:01:55,687 --> 01:01:57,996
Nobody.
Pablo and I, nobody else.

948
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:01,159
Not even Luisa,
or anyone else in the department.

949
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:02,760
Of course not.

950
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:05,841
By the way,

951
01:02:07,247 --> 01:02:08,362
where is Eduardo?

952
01:02:08,527 --> 01:02:10,643
He's dead.
He was killed by that monster

953
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:11,956
you keep in there!

954
01:02:12,127 --> 01:02:13,355
Ana...

955
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:16,401
I see.

956
01:02:17,927 --> 01:02:21,124
Im sorry to hear that.
I had other plans for him.

957
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:23,166
Son of a bitch...

958
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:29,839
We need you alive,

959
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:32,962
but not necessarily uninjured.

960
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:34,436
I'll tell you something

961
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:38,237
to spare you the trouble
of having to wonder.

962
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:41,045
You were very close.

963
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:45,244
You almost figured right.

964
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:49,119
But its not about money.

965
01:02:50,407 --> 01:02:54,116
Trust me, numbers are important.
We all have one.

966
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:56,517
They still don't have
the amount they need.

967
01:02:57,207 --> 01:03:00,085
Ls not 661 million.

968
01:03:01,207 --> 01:03:02,606
Ls not an amount of money.

969
01:03:03,887 --> 01:03:05,559
What kind of joke is this?

970
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,321
What do you want from us?
We haven't done anything!

971
01:03:08,967 --> 01:03:10,639
Ls a very bizarre joke.

972
01:03:10,807 --> 01:03:13,480
The kind that aren't funny at all.

973
01:03:14,647 --> 01:03:16,956
They're looking for people.

974
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:19,402
The three of us,
with Pablo and Eduardo,

975
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:22,242
add up to 666.

976
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:24,477
- I don't get it.
- Those medallions...

977
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:27,882
Cthulhu!

978
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,721
It can't be.
Its an ancient cult

979
01:03:32,887 --> 01:03:35,924
that required a certain number
of human sacrifices

980
01:03:36,527 --> 01:03:39,360
to realize a series
of arcane invocations.

981
01:03:39,527 --> 01:03:40,642
But is impossible.

982
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:42,320
Are you all crazy or what?

983
01:03:42,607 --> 01:03:43,801
Your explanation

984
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:47,245
is just about the most simplistic
Ive ever heard.

985
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:49,718
We're not going to invoke anything.

986
01:03:49,887 --> 01:03:51,081
On the contrary.

987
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:53,482
And now,

988
01:03:53,647 --> 01:03:55,558
let us proceed.
There isnt time.

989
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:58,201
Lazaro Valdemar tried it
over a century ago

990
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,403
and failed. Youll only make

991
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:01,556
the same mistake.

992
01:04:01,727 --> 01:04:06,164
I intend to correct a mistake,
not make one. Now enough chit-chat.

993
01:04:06,327 --> 01:04:07,476
Max.

994
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:09,842
You'll never get away with this.

995
01:04:10,127 --> 01:04:13,119
You can't cover up 666 disappearances.

996
01:04:15,367 --> 01:04:17,597
That won't matter after tonight.

997
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:19,880
What is he saying?

998
01:04:58,047 --> 01:04:59,844
- Where are you taking us?
- What?

999
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:02,920
Where are you taking us?
You son of a bitch...

1000
01:05:08,727 --> 01:05:09,796
Nora? Nora!

1001
01:05:10,087 --> 01:05:12,043
What the fuck is going on?

1002
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:13,162
Nora!

1003
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:15,119
What the hell is all this?

1004
01:05:18,647 --> 01:05:19,762
Sommelier.

1005
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:21,560
Chamberlain.

1006
01:05:23,247 --> 01:05:24,282
Everything in order?

1007
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:28,319
Yes, theyve found the incubus
in the abyss.

1008
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:29,636
It was unconscious.

1009
01:05:30,087 --> 01:05:31,361
They managed to chain it up

1010
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:34,121
without incident.
They're bringing it now.

1011
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:36,120
Even better.

1012
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:38,762
The scariest thing of all
ended up being

1013
01:05:38,927 --> 01:05:41,282
- the easiest.
- I have one question.

1014
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:43,515
Weren't there four?

1015
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:48,078
One died in the cave. If necessary
we can use a volunteer from the Order.

1016
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:49,566
No, we cannot.

1017
01:05:50,007 --> 01:05:54,683
Bringing in outsiders is already
a mistake. They mustnt be mixed.

1018
01:05:56,247 --> 01:05:57,726
Ive had enough from you,

1019
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,002
Chamberlain.

1020
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:04,082
You've disrupted this ritual from the
start with your presumptuous attempt

1021
01:06:04,247 --> 01:06:06,477
to take my place in the Order.

1022
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:09,766
When this is all over,

1023
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:13,005
I'll think of what to do with you.
Prepare the trays.

1024
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:14,316
Ls time to begin.

1025
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,122
Now.

1026
01:06:17,447 --> 01:06:18,641
As you command.

1027
01:06:26,407 --> 01:06:28,398
Tarantulas from Innsmouth.

1028
01:06:29,447 --> 01:06:32,757
Eat them quickly, without fear.

1029
01:06:33,807 --> 01:06:35,160
The blood of the spiders...

1030
01:06:35,327 --> 01:06:37,602
- Nora!
... will put your senses to sleep.

1031
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:39,646
- It will protect you.
- Nora!

1032
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:44,842
Bring it, please.

1033
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:47,801
It must be done quickly.
He's starting to doubt.

1034
01:06:50,647 --> 01:06:51,716
Nora!

1035
01:06:53,367 --> 01:06:54,516
Eat them.

1036
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:58,836
No mind can bear
gazing upon our lords

1037
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:01,078
without first going insane.

1038
01:07:08,087 --> 01:07:09,042
Listen to us.

1039
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:14,720
That man may have his revenge...

1040
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:20,559
and that we may be rewarded
by your resurrection.

1041
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:35,683
Lazaro, youll have to stand
on the seal.

1042
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:37,236
Finally,

1043
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:39,119
after all these years,

1044
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,603
well finish this once and for all.

1045
01:07:43,007 --> 01:07:44,440
A long time ago

1046
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:48,686
those words were spoken to me
by a man just as obsessed as you are.

1047
01:07:49,927 --> 01:07:52,487
What makes tonight different

1048
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:55,118
is I have nothing to lose.

1049
01:07:55,287 --> 01:07:56,481
On the contrary.

1050
01:07:57,527 --> 01:08:00,041
Its not that you have nothing to lose,

1051
01:08:00,527 --> 01:08:03,200
but that you have so much to gain.

1052
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:18,480
Turn around.

1053
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,237
Ana, is okay.
Calm down.

1054
01:08:22,127 --> 01:08:23,355
You'll be fine.

1055
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:25,518
No one must interfere
in the sacrifice.

1056
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:27,356
It can't be...

1057
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:38,159
This is our demand.

1058
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:44,076
Return the demon to the flames of Hell.

1059
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:48,518
What happens next exactly?

1060
01:08:49,447 --> 01:08:51,005
Are things going okay?

1061
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:56,435
The ritual to control the demon
has successfully begun,

1062
01:08:56,607 --> 01:08:58,518
but time mustn't be wasted.

1063
01:09:00,327 --> 01:09:02,363
We offer you the last souls

1064
01:09:02,967 --> 01:09:04,878
as an offering.

1065
01:09:05,047 --> 01:09:09,165
Let their blood be the river
that joins us.

1066
01:09:16,207 --> 01:09:18,482
Sacrificing the baby isn't essential,
its only a link.

1067
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:21,843
It facilitates protocol
between worlds.

1068
01:09:22,407 --> 01:09:24,443
Its like a cover letter
to the Great Old Ones.

1069
01:09:25,687 --> 01:09:27,917
To show our lords
we worship and respect them.

1070
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:34,480
Now it must be killed.
Quickly and without hesitation.

1071
01:09:36,687 --> 01:09:41,442
Then the last four victims are offered,
reaching the number 666.

1072
01:09:42,047 --> 01:09:43,605
Finally the Devil will fall

1073
01:09:43,967 --> 01:09:46,720
and the Great Old Ones
will rise for a new kingdom.

1074
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:16,963
Run!

1075
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:19,802
Stop!

1076
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:21,036
Nobody move!

1077
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:22,720
Chamberlain, whas happening?

1078
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:26,847
Carelessness always precedes calamity.

1079
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:30,325
The Great Old Ones
must never be mocked.

1080
01:10:34,687 --> 01:10:35,881
Come on, come on!

1081
01:10:36,047 --> 01:10:38,277
Sir... This way.

1082
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:42,520
Nobody move!

1083
01:11:02,047 --> 01:11:03,685
We beg mercy of you.

1084
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:49,365
As men we worship you.
We beg you to enslave us!

1085
01:12:04,127 --> 01:12:05,765
Sir, this must be stopped.

1086
01:12:05,927 --> 01:12:07,679
The ritual must be performed again.

1087
01:12:07,887 --> 01:12:10,765
We no longer need an infant.
The obelisk has been completed.

1088
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:14,044
Those required by the ritual
have been killed by the devil.

1089
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:48,036
Now is the time to make the request.
But please, quickly.

1090
01:12:48,287 --> 01:12:49,845
There's no time to lose.

1091
01:13:03,047 --> 01:13:07,518
In my right as a signatory,
I wish to make my request.

1092
01:13:15,087 --> 01:13:17,282
I ask you to stop
the invocation just performed

1093
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:20,603
along with the curse on my family.

1094
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,486
My love!

1095
01:14:27,647 --> 01:14:28,443
Leonor?

1096
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:30,886
Leonor, whas wrong?

1097
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:40,681
Sommelier, whas happening to us?

1098
01:14:44,687 --> 01:14:47,201
Sir, theres something
you must understand.

1099
01:14:47,447 --> 01:14:49,756
Your decline
was not due to witchcraft,

1100
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:52,117
but to the very nature of time.

1101
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:55,843
Without the curse,
you both return to your rightful age.

1102
01:14:56,447 --> 01:14:57,766
150 years old.

1103
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:01,922
Wait a moment.

1104
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:03,446
The agreement.

1105
01:15:04,007 --> 01:15:06,396
There might be time
for one last request.

1106
01:15:10,487 --> 01:15:11,476
Sir,

1107
01:15:11,647 --> 01:15:13,046
the Necronomicon
will soon be destroyed.

1108
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:18,082
But as long as it remains active,
theres still hope.

1109
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,238
There's time for one last prayer.
Do it.

1110
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:23,638
No. All I want is to stop the aging.

1111
01:15:25,007 --> 01:15:26,076
Leonor,

1112
01:15:26,367 --> 01:15:27,243
my love.

1113
01:15:27,647 --> 01:15:29,319
I'll find a way
to stop the process.

1114
01:15:29,487 --> 01:15:30,636
No.

1115
01:15:31,807 --> 01:15:33,718
I dont want our family name

1116
01:15:33,887 --> 01:15:36,196
stained in blood any longer.

1117
01:15:36,767 --> 01:15:38,086
Their souls...

1118
01:15:38,327 --> 01:15:40,716
The Great Old Ones don't want them.

1119
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:42,925
Free them.

1120
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:44,961
Please.

1121
01:15:45,327 --> 01:15:46,521
How do you know?

1122
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:49,681
I've spent the last 100 years
in Purgatory.

1123
01:15:52,127 --> 01:15:56,439
I never stopped hearing
their cries of sorrow and grief.

1124
01:15:57,127 --> 01:15:58,276
Yes, but...

1125
01:15:58,807 --> 01:16:00,684
There's still time for another request.

1126
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:03,164
- Just one, my love.
- No.

1127
01:16:05,047 --> 01:16:07,322
Let two old people die

1128
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:10,078
and the innocent souls

1129
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:12,681
find their rest.

1130
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,603
In my right as a signatory,

1131
01:16:33,127 --> 01:16:34,924
I wish to make

1132
01:16:35,807 --> 01:16:37,399
my last request.

1133
01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:41,882
I ask for

1134
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,320
the release

1135
01:16:44,487 --> 01:16:46,205
of the souls

1136
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:49,361
that have been sacrificed

1137
01:16:50,407 --> 01:16:51,396
for this

1138
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:53,000
ritual.

1139
01:18:28,967 --> 01:18:30,480
Well, well, well.

1140
01:18:31,487 --> 01:18:34,718
Little Red Riding Hood
wants to fight the Big Bad Wolf.

1141
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:40,283
I should have killed you
a long time ago.

1142
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:42,358
You've caused nothing but trouble,

1143
01:18:42,887 --> 01:18:44,798
and tonighs little slip up...

1144
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:46,920
Congratulations.

1145
01:18:48,207 --> 01:18:49,560
You got your way.

1146
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,639
Oh, youve got a weapon.
Great.

1147
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,602
I've got one too.

1148
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,086
But mine is better!

1149
01:18:58,247 --> 01:19:00,124
What now, you moron?

1150
01:19:00,447 --> 01:19:02,802
Thats what you are, a fucking moron!

1151
01:19:03,607 --> 01:19:05,837
Thats why you'll always be alone.

1152
01:19:06,567 --> 01:19:08,717
Wait till you see the present
I got you.

1153
01:19:08,967 --> 01:19:10,605
Where do you want it?

1154
01:19:10,807 --> 01:19:12,240
Here? Here?

1155
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:16,163
Carve him up into little pieces!

1156
01:19:17,367 --> 01:19:19,039
I might be crazy.

1157
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,005
You've called me that before.

1158
01:19:24,567 --> 01:19:25,841
But you know what?

1159
01:19:28,007 --> 01:19:29,725
I think I've found

1160
01:19:30,647 --> 01:19:31,966
a cure for it!

1161
01:19:37,687 --> 01:19:38,676
Santiago.

1162
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:40,236
Santiago.

1163
01:19:42,087 --> 01:19:44,362
- Can we help you?
- They're dead.

1164
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:47,439
A bunch of people are dead.

1165
01:19:47,687 --> 01:19:50,247
Shit, he's bleeding again.

1166
01:19:50,967 --> 01:19:52,366
Santiago.

1167
01:19:52,527 --> 01:19:54,119
We'll get you to a hospital,

1168
01:19:54,287 --> 01:19:55,436
okay?

1169
01:19:56,287 --> 01:19:58,642
Give us your exact location.

1170
01:19:59,447 --> 01:20:01,165
Sir? Are you all right?

1171
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:03,883
Wait till you see the present
I got you.

1172
01:20:07,247 --> 01:20:10,000
We're almost there.
Hang on a little longer.

1173
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:13,686
We need a doctor. Over.

1174
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:27,237
Sir, they've found the wounded.

1175
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:30,319
- They're out of danger.
- So whas the bad news?

1176
01:20:30,847 --> 01:20:32,280
Ls worse than bad.

1177
01:20:32,687 --> 01:20:34,484
I've never seen anything like it.

1178
01:20:34,647 --> 01:20:38,481
There was a massacre in the ruins.
I couldn't even write the report.

1179
01:20:39,327 --> 01:20:41,283
Walter's counting the bodies.

1180
01:20:41,487 --> 01:20:43,125
Prieto couldn't take it.
I had to send him home.

1181
01:20:43,287 --> 01:20:45,960
Call for back up.
If is as bad as I think,

1182
01:20:46,127 --> 01:20:50,200
I don't even want to think about
what we might find under that trap door.

1183
01:20:57,967 --> 01:20:59,195
Ls Santiago.

1184
01:21:08,927 --> 01:21:13,603
We're here in Montenegro where something
shocking has just occurred.

1185
01:21:13,767 --> 01:21:18,363
The place is full of ambulances,
police, bodies and reporters.

1186
01:21:18,527 --> 01:21:21,121
- You can't be here.
- Something amazing has happened.

1187
01:21:29,087 --> 01:21:30,236
How is he?

1188
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:34,000
He held on just to make sure
you were all right.

1189
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:37,364
We're doing what we can,
but he's lost a lot of blood.

1190
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:38,802
Let me through!

1191
01:21:38,967 --> 01:21:40,958
- Ma'am, you can't be here.
- Thas my son!

1192
01:21:41,127 --> 01:21:42,765
My baby!

1193
01:21:44,647 --> 01:21:47,161
I'm sorry, he just passed away.

1194
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:52,839
I'm here, baby.

1195
01:21:53,407 --> 01:21:56,524
Its me, Mommy.
I'm here with you.

1196
01:21:57,887 --> 01:21:59,764
Santiago, sweetie.

1197
01:22:01,247 --> 01:22:02,441
Ls Mommy.

1198
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:05,646
You'll never be alone again.

1199
01:22:11,207 --> 01:22:12,481
Ls impossible.

1200
01:22:13,247 --> 01:22:14,839
The ECG is unplugged.

1201
01:22:33,007 --> 01:22:34,122
Good morning.

1202
01:22:34,527 --> 01:22:36,119
I hope you're feeling better.

1203
01:22:36,927 --> 01:22:38,918
I know is inconsiderate of me

1204
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:42,443
to ask you for a statement
in your condition,

1205
01:22:42,687 --> 01:22:43,915
but in extreme situations

1206
01:22:44,087 --> 01:22:46,237
if we wait too long
people forget things

1207
01:22:46,407 --> 01:22:48,045
that can be relevant.

1208
01:22:49,607 --> 01:22:52,280
What were they doing here exactly?

1209
01:22:53,767 --> 01:22:55,917
Were not sure.
There was a lot of confusion.

1210
01:22:56,087 --> 01:22:58,442
Please, do it later.

1211
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,037
They need more treatment and rest.

1212
01:23:01,207 --> 01:23:02,356
Of course.

1213
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:06,078
By the way,
the vultures just got here.

1214
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,442
No talking to the press
until you talk to me first.

1215
01:23:09,287 --> 01:23:11,676
I'll be back with something to eat.

1216
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:16,360
He's one of them.

1217
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:19,238
He wants to see if you know anything.

1218
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:20,323
How do you know?

1219
01:23:20,487 --> 01:23:23,081
They're nervous because
theyd never got this far.

1220
01:23:23,247 --> 01:23:27,001
They're worried that outsiders
may have survived.

1221
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:29,920
Its of vital importance
that you stick together.

1222
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:33,726
Be smart and play dumb.

1223
01:23:35,047 --> 01:23:36,446
Play dumb!

1224
01:23:36,647 --> 01:23:38,717
- Maam, wait...
- Well.

1225
01:23:39,207 --> 01:23:40,765
Victory in the face of horror.

1226
01:23:43,327 --> 01:23:45,841
I only came to make sure
you're all right.

1227
01:23:46,567 --> 01:23:49,843
I imagine you're frightened
and have a thousand questions.

1228
01:23:50,247 --> 01:23:51,521
Youre the man who came...

1229
01:23:51,687 --> 01:23:55,726
To the office? Yes.
And many other places.

1230
01:23:56,927 --> 01:24:00,283
It was my job, to observe you
without interfering.

1231
01:24:00,647 --> 01:24:03,081
To avoid distractions.

1232
01:24:03,567 --> 01:24:05,046
To lead us to slaughter.

1233
01:24:07,487 --> 01:24:10,718
Involving you in all this
was a serious mistake.

1234
01:24:11,607 --> 01:24:13,757
I tried to persuade Maximilian not to,

1235
01:24:14,687 --> 01:24:16,439
but he wouldn't listen,
as usual.

1236
01:24:16,887 --> 01:24:19,924
His death has ended a cycle.
Now another shall begin.

1237
01:24:20,967 --> 01:24:22,082
But it must be a clean break

1238
01:24:22,247 --> 01:24:24,397
from the errors of the past.

1239
01:24:25,487 --> 01:24:26,806
You understand, don't you?

1240
01:24:27,807 --> 01:24:29,240
And with a new guide.

1241
01:24:29,727 --> 01:24:31,126
A sommelier.

1242
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:39,203
I have a proposition to make.

1243
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:41,999
Join us. Join the Order.

1244
01:24:43,727 --> 01:24:46,366
It hasnt been easy,
but you would be welcome.

1245
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:48,486
Are you joking?

1246
01:24:48,727 --> 01:24:49,842
Does it look like I am?

1247
01:24:53,287 --> 01:24:55,881
I think we all understand
the situation, dont we?

1248
01:24:56,727 --> 01:24:58,797
Considering how much you know,

1249
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,319
Im doing you a favor.

1250
01:25:03,167 --> 01:25:05,317
Believe me, the alternative
would be much more

1251
01:25:07,207 --> 01:25:08,435
unpleasant.

1252
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:11,716
Ls funny.

1253
01:25:12,287 --> 01:25:15,643
It looks like were going to have
to live in permanent uncertainty.

1254
01:25:17,047 --> 01:25:18,560
What do you mean?

1255
01:25:19,287 --> 01:25:21,881
Were not the only survivors of...

1256
01:25:22,087 --> 01:25:23,759
the horror.

1257
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:25,641
Someone else

1258
01:25:26,207 --> 01:25:29,643
was compiling data,
taking notes about the foundation

1259
01:25:29,807 --> 01:25:32,480
to gain influence and embezzle money.

1260
01:25:33,887 --> 01:25:37,197
He planned to offer his findings
as a tribute to enter the Order.

1261
01:25:37,527 --> 01:25:38,482
No.

1262
01:25:38,887 --> 01:25:41,003
The fat guy never offered us anything.

1263
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:42,919
He was trying to blackmail us.

1264
01:25:43,247 --> 01:25:44,521
I don't mean Pablo Orquicia.

1265
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:47,522
Eduardo.

1266
01:25:48,287 --> 01:25:50,357
Eduardo kept it all.

1267
01:25:50,527 --> 01:25:52,245
Names, dates...

1268
01:25:52,407 --> 01:25:54,841
Orquicia only found out about
a small part.

1269
01:25:55,007 --> 01:25:56,235
He tried to make a buck.

1270
01:25:56,807 --> 01:25:58,559
We know where it all is.

1271
01:25:59,007 --> 01:26:03,046
And we'll make it public
if something happens to one of us.

1272
01:26:04,407 --> 01:26:05,601
Nice try.

1273
01:26:06,487 --> 01:26:08,125
You dont expect me to believe that.

1274
01:26:08,567 --> 01:26:11,320
- Ls a lousy bluff.
- What is?

1275
01:26:12,087 --> 01:26:14,999
The transfers to buy silence?

1276
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:18,318
Birth certificates
belonging to 650 people?

1277
01:26:18,487 --> 01:26:21,001
Erasing public archives?

1278
01:26:21,807 --> 01:26:22,922
Should I go on?

1279
01:26:23,967 --> 01:26:27,198
Being held captive
brings out the honesty in people.

1280
01:26:27,647 --> 01:26:29,205
But if you want proof...

1281
01:26:32,367 --> 01:26:34,642
Here's some of the stuff he showed us.

1282
01:26:36,327 --> 01:26:38,716
He thought he'd get a chance
to talk to Maximilian.

1283
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:43,245
You can keep those.
There are boxes full of them.

1284
01:26:48,887 --> 01:26:50,525
Why not go straight to the police?

1285
01:26:50,687 --> 01:26:53,076
Because we want to live free
of the threat of revenge.

1286
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:55,761
If youre smart and leave us alone,

1287
01:26:55,927 --> 01:26:57,565
well play dumb.

1288
01:26:59,967 --> 01:27:01,446
But if you do anything stupid,

1289
01:27:01,607 --> 01:27:04,201
well get smart.

1290
01:27:11,247 --> 01:27:12,441
Be careful.

1291
01:27:13,527 --> 01:27:16,200
When you bite off
more than you can chew,

1292
01:27:16,367 --> 01:27:18,164
you might end up choking.

1293
01:27:21,687 --> 01:27:24,645
We're waiting for the witnesses.

1294
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:27,640
What happened?
Will you make a statement?

1295
01:27:27,807 --> 01:27:29,479
How many people died?

1296
01:27:29,687 --> 01:27:31,598
What happened exactly?
