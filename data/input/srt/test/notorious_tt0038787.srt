1
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,357
Chattering

2
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,500
Is there any legal reason why
sentence should not be pronounced?

3
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,702
No, Your Honor.
Yes. I have something to say.

4
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,712
You can put me away. But you can't
put away what's going to happen...

5
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,578
to you and to this
whole country next time.

6
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,982
Next time we are going to
I wouldn't say anymore.

7
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,520
We'll leave that for the appeal.

8
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,649
It is the judgment of this court
that the defendant, John Huberman,

9
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,286
having been found guilty of the crime
of treason against the United States...

10
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:14,298
by the jury of this court for the
southern district of Florida at Miami,

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,801
be committed to the custody
of the United States attorney general...

12
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,271
for imprisonment in an institution
of the penitentiary type...

13
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,842
for a period of 20 years.

14
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,911
And the defendant
may be forthwith remanded...

15
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,276
to the custody
of the United States marshall.

16
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,440
Court is now adjourned.
Here she comes.

17
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:38,290
Just a minute, Miss Huberman.
Hold it, Miss Huberman.

18
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,883
We'd like a statement from you,
Miss Huberman, about your father.

19
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,463
For instance, do you think
your father got what he deserved?

20
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,930
Could we say you're pleased your
father is going to pay the penalty...

21
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,297
for being a German worker?

22
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,064
Let us know
if she tries to leave town.

24

Jazz

25
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,809
Would you care to pause for
some refreshments, Mr. Hop... kins?

26
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,880
Alicia, were you really followed by
a policeman? It sounds very exciting.

27
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:15,119
I'm going to shoot it out
with them tomorrow.
He's had enough.

28
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,459
So have you.
Don't be silly. The important
drinking hasn't started yet.

29
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,261
Man On Radio Everybody here's
got a stuffed fish hanging on the wall.

30
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,562
Where'd they get it?
Never seen a fish.

31
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,071
How about you, handsome?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

32
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,041
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I like party crashers.

33
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,636
He's not a party crasher.
I brought him.
Oh.

34
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,716
Chattering
I wouldn't mind
being followed by a cop.

35
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,911
I hate low, underhanded people
like policemen pussyfooting after you.

36
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,045
Because I'm a marked
woman, you know.

37
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,784
I'm liable to blow up
the Panama Canal any minute now.

38
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,087
Do you want some ice in it?
No, thank you.

39
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,254
It's not becoming for a lovely girl
like you to be worried about policemen.

40
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,423
You won't be tomorrow.
Oh, really?

41
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,229
We sail at 10:00.
Really? We just sail away, huh?

42
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,429
Show me a fish,
and I'll show you a liar.

43
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,938
What this party needs
is a little gland treatment.
No fish.

44
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,066
We'd better start breaking up, Alicia.
I have to be on board at 9:00.

45
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,340
One week in Havana, and this whole thing
about your father will have blown over.

46
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,712
Do you love me, Commodore?
You're a very beautiful woman.

47
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,944
I'll have another drink
to appreciate that.

48
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,020
Where are you going?
Fishing.

49
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,521
This time of night?
How about you? Still drinking?

50
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,889
What's the difference?
You know something? I like you.

51
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,360
Well, I'll see you
on board, Alicia, 9:00.

52
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,624
Oh, I'll
have to think that over.

53
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,599
You don't have to pack.
We can pick up some things in Havana.

54
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,226
I think I'll have to leave him
here to dry out a little.

55
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:35,239
I'm very sorry you all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.

56
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,605
Good night.
Good night.

57
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,769
Good night, dear.
Good night.

58
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,027
There's one more drink
left apiece.

59
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,756
Shame about the ice.
What is?

60
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,355
Gone.
Who's gone?

61
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,596
The ice.
Why do you like that song?

62
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,140
Giggling

63
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,371
Because it's a lot of hooey.

64
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:19,707
There's nothing like a love song
to give you a good laugh.

65
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,719
That's right.

66
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,455
It's stuffy in here, isn't it?

67
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,460
Might be.

68
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,462
What about...

69
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,433
we have a picnic?

70
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,104
Outside?

71
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,637
It's too stuffy
in here for a picnic.

72
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,278
Wanna finish that?
Shame to leave it.

73
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,415
You're quite a boy.

74
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,164
Groans

75
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,562
My car is outside.
Naturally.

76
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,606
Wanna go for a ride?
Very much.

77
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,736
Giggling

78
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,338
What about your guests?

79
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,111
They'll crawl out
under their own steam.

80
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:31,555
I'm going to drive.
That's understood.

81
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,996
Don't you need a coat?
You'll do.

82
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,375
Wait a minute. Let me put this on you.
You might catch cold.

83
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,230
How am I doing?
Not bad.

84
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,342
Scared?
No.

85
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,207
Oh, no, you're not scared
of anything, are you?

86
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,678
Not too much.

87
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:36,451
This fog gets me.
That's your hair in your eyes.

88
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,490
Oh.

89
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,455
What does the speedometer say?

90
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,866
Sixty-five.

91
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:58,067
I'm gonna make it 80
and wipe that grin off your face.

92
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:02,079
I don't like gentlemen
who grin at me.

93
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,615

Siren Wailing

95
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,320
A cop.
What?

96
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,523
A policeman
is chasing us. Look.

97
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,862
Oh, they make me sick.

98
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,405
He wants to talk to you.

99
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,074
Drunken driving. My second offense.
Now I go to jail.

100
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,379
Whole family in jail.
Who cares?

101
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,827
Havin' a time to yourself,
aren't you?

102
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,634
People like you
ought to be in bed.

103
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,967
Drunk, huh?
Just a minute, officer.

104
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:03,007
No arguments, mister.
You ain't got a leg to stand on.

105
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,809
Sorry, but you didn't speak up.

106
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,945
That's all right.
Sure you can handle her?

107
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,114
No trouble.
Well, you oughta know.

108
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,959
Footsteps Departing

109
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,024
Where's the ticket?

110
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,194
Motorcycle Departs
He didn't give me a ticket.

111
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,865
What was your name?

112
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,874
Devlin.

113
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,639
When you showed that cop
something, he saluted you.

114
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,510
Did he?
I saw him.

115
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,848
Why, you double-crossing buzzard!
You're a cop!

116
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,149
All right, we'll argue later.

117
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,554
Get away from my car!
Get out of my car!

118
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,456
I'm gonna take you home.
You're not gonna take me home at all!

119
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,257
Ooh!
Move over.

120
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,592
Come on.
Ow!

121
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,364
Get out of my car,
federal cop!

122
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:12,137
Crashing my party, just like
that buzzard with the glasses!

123
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,611
Leave me alone! You're trailing me
to get something on me.

124
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,481
Get... out!
Whimpers, Sighs

125
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,520
Gonna calm down?

126
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,852
Good. Now, move over.

127
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,050
Oh.

128
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,128
I I'm not gonna le
Slap

129
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,037
Whew!

130
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,004
Engine Starts

131
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,277
Devlin
You'd better drink that.

132
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,024
Mumbles
All right.

133
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,466
Muttering

134
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,036
Go on, drink it.

135
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,537
Groaning

136
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,580
Finish it.

137
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,086
Groaning, Panting

138
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,343
Feel better?

139
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,947
What do you care how I feel?

140
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,912
You copper.

141
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,388
Groaning Continues

142
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,023
Train Whistle Blowing

143
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,999
What's this all about, huh?

144
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,508
What's your angle?
What angle?

145
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,511
About last night.
Just wanted to be friends.

146
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,844
Friends, yeah.
So you could frame me, hmm?

147
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,044
No, I've got a job for you.
Oh, yeah? Don't tell me.

148
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,451
There's only

149
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,524
Ohhh.

150
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,561
There's only one job that
you coppers would want me for.

151
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,790
Sighs
Well, you can forget it, Mr.

152
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,367
Devlin. Devlin.
What?

153
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,631
I am no stool pigeon,
Mr. Devlin.

154
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,674
My department authorized me
to engage you to do some work for us.
It's a job in Brazil.

155
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,404
Oh, go away.
The whole thing bores me.

156
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,608
Some of the German gentry who were
paying your father are working in Rio.

157
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,809
Ever hear of
the I.G. Farben Industries?

158
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,545
I tell you,
I'm not interested.

159
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,850
Farben has men in South America,
planted there before the war.

160
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,187
We're cooperating with the Brazilian
government to smoke them out.

161
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,592
My chief thinks
that the daughter of a
Of a traitor?

162
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,164
Well, he thinks you might
be valuable in the work.

163
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,234
They might sort of trust you.

164
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,734
And you could make up a little
for your daddy's peculiarities.

165
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,670
Why should I?
Patriotism.

166
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,571
That word gives me a pain.
No, thank you.

167
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,874
I don't go for patriotism...
or patriots.

168
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,948
I'd like to dispute that with you.

169
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,018
Waving the flag with one hand
and picking pockets with the other.

170
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,520
That's your patriotism.
Well, you can have it.

171
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:47,217
We've had your bungalow
wired for three months.

172
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,590
"Conversation between John Huberman
and daughter Alicia,

173
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,062
6:30 p. m., January 9, 1946,
at Miami Beach, Florida. "

174
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,827
Some of the evidence
that wasn't used at the trial.

175
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,632
I don't want to hear that.
Relax, hardboiled, and listen.

176
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:04,072
Huberman's Voice
... money in it, Alicia.

177
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,770
Alicia's Voice
I told you before Christmas
I wouldn't do it.

178
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,473
Huberman
You don't use your judgment.
You can have anything you want.

179
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,709
The work is easy.
Alicia I'll not listen, Father.

180
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,217
Huberman
This is not your country, is it?

181
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,551
Alicia My mother was born here.
We have American citizenship.

182
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,750
Huberman Where is your judgment?
In your feelings, you are German.

183
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,556
You've got to listen to me.
You don't know what we stand for.

184
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,291
Alicia I know what you stand for!
You and your murdering swine.

185
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,663
I've hated you
ever since I found out.

186
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,827
Huberman My daughter,
don't talk to me like that.

187
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,667
Alicia
Stay on your side of the table!
Alicia, put your voice down.

188
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,867
Alicia I hate you all.
And I love this country.

189
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,208
Do you understand that?
I love it.

190
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:45,374
I'll see you all hanged before
I'll raise a finger against it.

191
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:50,319
Now, go on and get out of here,
or so help me, I'll turn you in.

192
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:54,984
Don't ever come near me or speak to me
again about your rotten schemes.

193
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,654
Record Stops

194
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:05,001
Well, that doesn't prove much.
I didn't turn him in.

195
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:09,666
We didn't expect you to.
Well, what do you say?

196
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:15,673
Scoffs
Go away and leave me alone.

197
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,717
I have my own life to lead.
Good times.

198
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,343
That's what I want.
And laughs with people I like.

199

Doorbell Buzzing
And no underhanded cops who want
to put me in a shooting gallery.

200
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,886
Knocking At Door
But people of my own kind...

201
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,327
who'll treat me right
and like me and understand me.

202
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,491
Door Opens
Good morning, Alicia.

203
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,502
Oh, hello.
Thought you might
need a hand this morning.

204
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,370
We're sailing with the tide,
you know. Are you ready?
Yes.

205
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,875
Don't tell me you've
forgotten, my dear.
Almost.

206
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,038
I'll help you pack, although
you really don't need anything.
We've got everything on board.

207
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,241
Oh, thank you.
I'll pack myself. I

208
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,148
We're moored at the hotel pier.
You know the spot.

209
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,517
Yes.
You're a darling.

210
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,752
Sweetest girl I ever knew.
See you soon.

211
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,157
Door Closes

212
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,163
Well, what about it?
Plane leaves tomorrow morning, early.

213
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,966
All right.
You better tell him.

214
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,569
Quiet Chattering

215
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,646
Hmm. I'll tell her.

216
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,648
See you later.

217
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,058
He's a very nice-looking man.

218
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,025
You'll be seeing him in Rio.

219
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,121
Oh, no, no.
I won't be seeing any men in Rio.

220
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,599
Oh, yes, you will.
That's our boss, Paul Prescott.

221
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,372
Did he say anything about the job?

222
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,704
No.
No hints?

223
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,338
No. But he had some news about your
father he picked up at the last stop.

224
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,008
What about him?
He died this morning.

225
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,957
Oh. How?

226
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,223
Poison capsule.
He did it himself?

227
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:48,163
Yes, in his cell. Sorry.

228
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,438
I don't know
why I should feel so bad.

229
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,703
When he told me a few years ago
what he was, everything went to pot.

230
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,178
I didn't care
what happened to me.

231
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,148
But now I remember
how nice he once was.

232
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,377
How nice we both were.

233
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,317
Very nice.

234
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,084
It's a very curious feeling,

235
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:17,856
as if something had happened
to me and not to him.

236
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,955
You see, I don't
have to hate him anymore.

237
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,966
Or myself.

238
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,536
We're coming into Rio.

239
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,465
Alicia
Oh, yes. So we are.

240
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,260
Latin

241
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,733
I wonder if the embassy
someone can get me a maid.

242
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:01,237
It's a nice apartment, and I don't mind
dusting and sweeping but I hate cooking.

243
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,240
I'll ask them.
And while you're at it,

244
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,902
find out when I go to work,
and on what.
Yes, ma'am.

245
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,605
Waiter Speaking Portuguese
Have another drink?

246
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,150
No, thank you. I've had enough.
Oh. Whiskey and soda.

247
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,879
Well, do you hear that?

248
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,979
I'm practically on the wagon.
That's quite a change.

249
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,821
It's a phase.
You don't think a woman can change?

250
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,522
Sure. But change is fun...
for a while.

251
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,533
For a while.
What a rat you are, Devlin.

252
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,627
All right. You've been
sober for eight days.

253
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:36,037
As far as I know,
you've made no new conquests.

254
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,041
Well, that's something.

255
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,408
Eight days.
Practically whitewashed.

256
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:46,712
I'm very happy, Dev.
Why won't you let me be happy?

257
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,514
Nobody's stopping you.

258
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:57,127
Why don't you give that
copper's brain of yours a rest?

259
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,221
Every time you look at me,
I can see it dwelling over its slogans:

260
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,291
"Once a crook, always a crook.
Once a tramp, always a tramp. "

261
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,568
Go on. You can hold my hand.

262
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,972
I won't blackmail you
for it afterwards.

263
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,976
Scared?

264
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,411
I've always been scared
of women, but I get over it.

265
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,710
And now you're scared of yourself.

266
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,910
You're afraid you'll
fall in love with me.

267
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,386
That wouldn't be hard.
Ooh, now, careful, careful.

268
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,616
You enjoy making fun
of me, don't you?

269
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,256
No, Dev.
I'm making fun of myself.

270
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,764
I'm pretending I'm a nice,
unspoiled child...

271
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,334
whose heart is full
of daisies and buttercups.

272
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,064
Nice daydream. Than what?

273
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,966
Waiter, Indistinct

274
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,103
I think I will have another drink.

275
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,181
I thought you'd get around to it.

276
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,182
Make it a double.

277
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,151
Devlin Orders In Portuguese

278
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,616
Why won't you believe in me, Dev?

279
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,927
Just a little.

280
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,632
Why won't you?

281
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:24,047
I know why you won't, Dev.
You're sore.

282
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,050
You're sore because you've
fallen for a little drunk...

283
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,746
you tailed in Miami,
and you don't like it.

284
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,982
Makes you sick all over,
doesn't it?

285
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,059
People will laugh at you, the invincible
Devlin in love with someone...

286
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,424
who isn't worth
even wasting the words on.

287
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,090
Poor Dev, in love with a no-good gal.
It must be awful. I'm sorry

288
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,232
Car Horns Honking

289
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,306
Gentlemen, I assure you
she's a perfect type for the job.

290
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,706
It's not the girl. It's this
German scientist I'm worried about.

291
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,644
I simply question why we don't find
some way of taking them into custody.

292
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,773
It'd do no good. Even if we arrested
their leader Alexander Sebastian,

293
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,751
tomorrow another Farben man
takes his place and their work goes on.

294
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:06,290
Yes, you're right. I see, Captain
Prescott, your method is the best way.

295
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,224
Well, she's good at making
friends with gentlemen,

296
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,058
and we want somebody inside
his house, in his confidence.

297
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,394
You have faith in this procedure,
Captain Prescott?

298
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,399
Oh, yes.
With somebody on the inside

299
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,594
Have you consulted the young lady?
No, not yet.

300
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,935
As a matter of fact, our man Devlin just
brought here down here the other day.

301
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,406
Now we're waiting for Sebastian
to come back to Rio.

302
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,909
Has your Mr. Devlin told her
the nature of the work?

303
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,880
No, we haven't discussed it
with him at all. But I can set
your mind at rest about her.

304
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:34,076
You're sure of her political side?
Oh, oh, yes.

305
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:38,418
Well, there is nothing to be lost
if we proceed as you advise.

306
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,856
Now, that's fine. I'll give Devlin
his instructions right away.

307
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,752
It's nice out here.

308
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:47,951
Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.

309
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,254
We have to eat.

310
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:54,093
We can eat here.
I'll cook.

311
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,259
I thought you didn't
like to cook.

312
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,929
No, I don't like to cook.

313
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,971
But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.

314
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,442
What about all the washing up
afterward?

315
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,844
We'll eat it with our fingers.

316
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,882
Don't we need any plates?

317
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,350
Yes. One for you and one for me.

318
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,784
Mind if I have dinner
with you tonight?

319
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,418
I'd be delighted.

320
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,259
Where are you going?
Well, if we're going to stay in,

321
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,425
I have to telephone the hotel,
see if there are any messages.

322
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,504
You have to?
I have to.

323
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,645
Dialing Phone

324
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,913
This is a very strange
love affair.

325
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,181
Why?

326
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,554
Maybe the fact
that you don't love me.

327
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,924
Hello? Palace Hotel?
Parle Anglais?

328
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:03,694
This is T.R. Devlin.
Are there any messages for me?

329
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,669
When I don't love you,
I'll let you know.

330
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,705
You haven't said anything.

331
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,571
Actions speak louder than words.
Chuckling

332
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,668
There is? Good.
Read it to me, please.

333
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,257
Prescott wants me over
right away.

334
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,123
Did he say what about?
No.

335
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,026
Maybe it's our assignment.
Probably.

336
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,903
Do you want me to bring
anything back with me?

337
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:48,912
Yes. What about a nice bottle of wine?
We'll celebrate.

338
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,539
What time shall I come back?

339
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,641
Seven o'clock.

340
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,854
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

341
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,540
Prescott What is it, Devlin?
What's the matter?

342
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,875
I don't know if she'll do it.
What do you mean,
you don't think she'd

343
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,109
You haven't discussed it
with her, have you?
I didn't know what the job was.

344
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,378
Well, what do you mean,
she wouldn't do it?

345
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,751
Well, I don't think she's that type
of woman. She strikes me as being

346
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,881
I don't understand your attitude.

347
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,325
Why do you think she won't do it?
Well, she's had no experience.

348
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,195
Oh, come now. What experience
does she lack, do you think?

349
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,268
She's never been trained for that
kind of work. They'll see through her.

350
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,894
Miss Huberman was chosen
not only because her father...

351
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,599
gives her an ideal background,
but because Sebastian knows her.

352
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,975
Oh, yes. He was once
in love with her.

353
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,314
Oh, I didn't know that.

354
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,941
I don't see why we're arguing
about petty things like this.

355
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,953
We've got important work to do.
Sebastian's house is a cover-up...

356
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,353
for whatever this Farben
group's up to here in Rio.

357
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,451
We've got to get Miss Huberman
inside that house and find out
what's going on there.

358
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,998
So I think you'd better go back
to Miss Huberman and explain
to her what she has to do.

359
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,363
I, uh
Well, what is it?

360
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,995
Nothing, sir.
Oh, I thought you were
going to say something.

361
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,336
How is the meeting to be arranged?
Oh, well, we've discussed that.

362
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,239
I think the riding club
would be the best place.

363
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:29,211
Sebastian usually
rides there in the mornings.

364
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,977
So the rest is up to you
and Miss Huberman.

365
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,850
Okay, Devlin, that's all.
All right.

366
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,694
Door Closes

367
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,897
Alicia Dev, is that you?
Uh-huh.

368
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,439
I'm glad you're late. This chicken
took longer than I expected.

369
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,442
What did they say?
Hope it isn't done too much.

370
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,842
It caught fire once.

371
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:05,143
I think it's better
if I cut it up out here.

372
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,310
Unless you want a half a one
to yourself. Chuckles

373
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,980
We're going to have
knives and forks after all.

374
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,284
I've decided we're
going to eat in style.

375
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:17,760
Marriage must be wonderful with this
sort of thing going on every day.

376
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,464
I wonder if it's too cold out here.
Maybe we should eat inside.

377
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,069
Hasn't something like this
happened before?

378
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,875
What's the matter?

379
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,882
Don't look so tense.
Troubles?

380
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,353
Well, handsome, I think you'd better
tell mama what's going on.

381
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,721
All this secrecy's going
to ruin my little dinner.

382
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,592
Come on, Mr. D.,
what is darkening your brow?

383
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,494
After dinner.
No, now.

384
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,702
Look, I'll make it easy for you.
The time has come...

385
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:02,000
when you must tell me that you have
a wife and two adorable children...

386
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,304
and this madness between us
can't go on any longer.

387
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,243
I'll bet you've heard
that line often enough.

388
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:16,745
Right below the belt every time.
Oh, that isn't fair, Dev.

389
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:21,087
Skip it. We have other things
to talk about. We've got a job.

390
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,527
Oh. So there is a job.

391
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,594
You, uh You remember
a man named Sebastian?

392
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,330
Alex Sebastian?
Yes.

393
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,532
One of my father's friends, yes.

394
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,876
He had quite a crush on you.

395
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,946
I wasn't very responsive.

396
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,182
Well, he's here. The head
of a large German business concern.

397
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,378
His family always had money.

398
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,786
He's part of the combine that
built up the German war machine
and hopes to keep on going.

399
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:56,292
Something big?
It has all the earmarks
of being something big.

400
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,521
We have to contact him.

401
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,207
Go on.
Let's have all of it.

402
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,910
We're meeting him tomorrow.
The rest is up to you.

403
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,783
You've got to work on him
and land him.

404
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:28,086
Mata Hari.
She makes love for the papers.

405
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,287
There are no papers.
You land him.

406
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,830
Find out what's going on
inside his house,

407
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,924
what the group around him
is up to, and report to us.

408
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,436
I suppose you knew about this pretty
little job of mine all the time.

409
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,340
No. I only just
found out about it.

410
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,314
Did you say anything?

411
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:54,112
I mean, that maybe I wasn't
the girl for such shenanigans?

412
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,382
I figured that was up to you.

413
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,923
If you'd care to back out
I suppose you told them,

414
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,051
"Alicia Huberman will have this
Sebastian eating out of her
hand in a couple of weeks.

415
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,359
She's good at that. Always was. "
I didn't say anything.

416
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:15,196
Not a word for that little
lovesick lady you left an hour ago?

417
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,966
I told you,
that's the assignment.

418
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,910
Oh, well, now,
don't get sore, Dev.

419
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:27,951
I'm only fishing for
a little bird call from my dream man.

420
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,914
One little remark such as,

421
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,424
"How dare you gentlemen
suggest that Alicia Huberman

422
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:39,462
the new Miss Huberman
be submitted to so ugly a fate?"

423
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,930
That's not funny.

424
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,431
Do you want me to take the job?

425
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,907
You're answering for yourself.
I am asking you.

426
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,002
It's up to you.

427
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,447
Not a peep, hmm?

428
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,854
Oh, darling, what you didn't
tell them, tell me

429
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,789
that you believe I'm nice and that
I love you and I'll never change back.

430
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,155
I'm waiting for your answer.

431
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,463
What a little pal you are.

432
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,101
Never believing me, hmm?
Not a word of faith.

433
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,805
Just down the drain with Alicia.
That's where she belongs.

434
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,817
Oh, Dev, Dev.

435
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,521
When do I go to work
for Uncle Sam?

436
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,623
Tomorrow morning.

437
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:05,378
Oh, we shouldn't have had this out here.
It's all cold now.

438
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,776
What are you looking for?

439
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,878
I had a bottle of champagne.
I must have left it somewhere.

440
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,900
In case you're asked,
I'm with Pan American Airways.

441
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,564
As Devlin?
Yes. Public relations office.

442
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,732
Anything else?

443
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,538
No, except we met on the plane
coming in from Miami.

444
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,737
Less detail, the better.

445
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,120
Are you sure that's him?
Yes.

446
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,856
We'll go by him easy,
let him spot you. Come on.

447
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,151
I guess I'm the girl
nobody remembers.

448
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,231
Was it Sebastian?
Yes.

449
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,891
We'll stick around,
give him another chance.

450
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,582
Bell Ringing

451
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,530
Orchestral

452
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,548
My dear Alicia, will you
forgive me for being late?

453
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,551
Last minute conference at the office.
You got my message?

454
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,383
Yes. It's all right, Alex.
Sweet of you to wait.

455
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,653
I was afraid you might run on.
Oh, I'm not that easily put off.

456
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,057
I was too anxious
to meet you again.

457
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,255
You know, I'm tired.

458
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,856
The worst thing about business
is it makes you feel old and look old.

459
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,732
You seem to have escaped
all of that.

460
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,567
Four years of dullness
and disintegration. Awful.

461
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,233
Alex, you look younger
than you did in Washington.

462
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,870
Well, it's a temporary improvement,
entirely due to your presence, my dear.

463
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,448
You always affected me like a tonic.

464
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,074
Perhaps now
with you here in Rio

465
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,086
unless you insist
on running away from me again

466
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,713
Oh, uh, would you like
another drink?

467
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,725
Yes. Thank you.
Deux martinis.

468
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,125
You know him?

469
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,863
No, I don't think so.
But he seems familiar.

470
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,871
Captain Prescott,
intelligence man.

471
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,998
He's down here as part
of a Washington espionage.

472
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,374
The American embassy
is loaded with them.
Really?

473
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,007
Hey, he's rather
handsome, isn't he?

474
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,584
I'm allergic
to American agents.

475
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,586
Their fine points don't
particularly appeal to me.

476
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,350
Have the bothered you
since you came down?

477
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,516
No. No, not yet.

478
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,729
They were troublesome in Miami?

479
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,821
Yes. That's why I left
right after the trial,

480
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,958
to get away from their snooping.

481
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,299
I wondered why
you left your father.

482
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,467
He insisted.
He was so unselfish.

483
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,943
He kept worrying about me,
begging me to leave.

484
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,640
I had no idea
he was going to die.

485
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,182
Many things have died
for all of us.

486
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,845
We mustn't let our spirit
die with them.

487
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,220
Perhaps I can help you
to forget. I'd like to.

488
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,924
It's odd...

489
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,589
but I feel at home with you.

490
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:19,602
You know, my dear,
I knew this was going to happen.

491
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:23,834
I knew when we met the other day
that if I saw you again,

492
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,501
I'd feel what I used to for you.

493
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,375
The same hunger.

494
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,914
You're so lovely, my dear.

495
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,452
Oh, now I'm going
to make a fool of myself again.

496
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,488
There's someone else, of course.
Who is it this time?

497
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,319
That Mr. Devlin you were with?

498
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,393
There is no one.

499
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,394
He seemed attentive.

500
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,499
Mr. Devlin has pestered me with his
attentiveness ever since I arrived.

501
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,002
I met him on the plane from Miami.
You made a pretty couple.

502
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,905
Oh, Alex, Mr. Devlin
doesn't interest me.

503
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:04,274
I was so lonely that day, I could
have gone riding with Peter Rabbit.

504
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,476
You'll let me help
your loneliness?

505
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:14,080
You are very sweet to forget
what a brat I was... once.

506
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:18,651
My dear, I shall test out
your repentance at once.

507
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,857
Will you have dinner with me
again tomorrow night?

508
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,196
Thank you very much.
My house?

509
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,538
Yes, how nice.
My mother is giving a dinner party.

510
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,699
She won't mind an extra guest?

511
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,835
An old friend
is never an extra guest.

512
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,881
Well, shall we order now?

513
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,146
Yes, yes. I'm starved.
Garcon.

514
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:46,713
Now, let's see, what shall we
what shall we have for our first
dinner together?

515
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,666
Door Opens

516
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,999
Good evening.
Very good.

517
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,235
Yes, yes, isn't it?

518
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,370
Oh, I'd like you to wear these.
They're rented for the occasion.

519
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,505
Oh. All right.

520
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,548
Would you help me,
please? I

521
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,053
Why-Why, yes, certainly.
Thank you.

522
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,555
So, uh, the old boy knew me, eh?

523
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,853
Yes. He thought
you were very handsome.

524
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,690
Oh, you don't say?
Sorry I'm not going with you.

525
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,855
Oh, Dev'll pick those up later.
All right.

526
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,866
Now, try to memorize the names
of all the people you see there tonight.

527
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,869
The men, I mean. And get their
nationalities. That's very important.

528
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,405
You mean the Germans?
That won't be difficult for me.

529
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,704
And I suggest that you don't ask any
questions. Just use your eyes and ears.

530
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,973
They're a pretty keen and desperate
bunch. Don't underestimate them.

531
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,742
Right. Thank you for your
instructions. Good evening.

532
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,751
Oh, by the way, unless you have
something very urgent to report,

533
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,617
I suggest that you two keep shy
of each other for the next few days.

534
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,555
That's in case Sebastian's people
want to check on you after your visit.

535
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,717
Yes, I understand.
That's all. Good luck.

536
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,727
Good evening.
Good night.

537
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,922
Piano
Good evening. I'm Miss Huberman.

538
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,933
Will you tell Mr. Sebastian
that I'm here?

539
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,633
Piano Continues

540
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,138
Chattering, Laughter

541
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,611
Miss Huberman?
Yes.

542
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,122
Please forgive me
for keeping you waiting.

543
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:37,524
Not at all.
You resemble your father very much.

544
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:40,722
I'm Alex's mother.
I knew when I saw you.

545
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,426
Alex has always admired you.
Now at last I know why.

546
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,435
You're very kind.

547
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:50,371
You did not testify at your father's
trial. We thought that unusual.

548
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,966
He didn't want me to. He refused
to let his lawyers call me on the stand.

549
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,012
I wonder why.

550
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,082
Hello... Alicia.

551
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,947
I'm so glad.
You met my mother.

552
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,111
Yes, we just met.
You didn't meet Alicia...

553
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,451
when we were in Washington
four years ago, did you, Mother?

554
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,787
I don't know where
you were at the time.

555
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,555
Alex, I think we should
join our other guests.

556
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,829
May I take your wrap?
Thank you.

557
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:31,475
Sebastian Miss Huberman,
may I present Eric Mathis?

558
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,779
How do you do?
How do you do?

559
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,319
William Rossner.

560
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,582
How do you do?

561
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,090
Very honored.

562
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,217
Emil Hupka.

563
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,353
How do you do?

564
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,363
Delighted.

565
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,899
And Mr. Knerr.

566
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,867
And Dr. Anderson.

567
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,203
Dr. Anderson.

568
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,971
It gives me great pleasure.

569
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,280
Dr. Anderson is our guest
of honor tonight.

570
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:10,114
You mustn't bore Miss Huberman,
Alex, with discourses on science.

571
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,154
Not before dinner, anyway.

572
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,656
Butler
Dinner is served, madame.

573
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:20,654
Dr. Anderson, you will sit
beside me, over there.

574
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,222
Eric, you will sit
next to Miss Huberman.

575
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,168
Dr. Anderson
You have just come from Spain, senora?

576
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,398
Mrs. Sebastian
A few weeks ago. It seems ages.

577
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:33,237
Travel does not mean anything
anymore. It goes so swift.

578
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,211
Indistinct Whispering
One has the feeling
of not going anywhere.

579
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:41,580
I suppose we can expect
rocket ships to be carrying us
across the ocean very soon.

580
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,812
Dr. Anderson
You can expect many strange things.

581
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:47,015
See a good movie
this afternoon, Eric?
No. I was disappointed.

582
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,787
Hmm, must have been a comedy. You know,
Eric loves to go to the movies to cry.

583
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,953
He's very sentimental.

584
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,861
Mrs. Sebastian Rambling

585
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,402
It takes nearly as long to go
from the city to the airport...

586
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,404
as it does to cross
over the Atlantic.

587
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,421
I'm afraid, gentlemen, that
something must be done about Emil.

588
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:23,892
I don't know. It was an understandable
slip. The man was tired.

589
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,088
No. It was
a very dangerous slip.

590
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,530
It's not the first one. There have been
several other lapses before.

591
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,034
There'll be more,
if we permit them.

592
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,571
That's bad.
That's very bad.

593
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,335
I think, gentlemen, you can
leave it to me to find some way.

594
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:42,173
When you drive up to Petropolis,
the road winds quite a bit.

595
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,179
It is very high.

596
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,681
There are some
very awkward turns.

597
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:51,653
I'm sure I will not have
any difficulty in getting Emil
to give me a lift in his car.

598
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,918
It's quite a trick to jump clear.

599
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,119
I'll just have to be careful,
that is all.

600
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,423
Turned my ankle the last time.

601
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,504
Madame says,
will you join the others...

602
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,043
or will you take
your coffee in here?

603
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,943
Oh, I think we'll take
coffee in here, Emil.

604
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:24,311
I'm very sorry, gentlemen,
to make such an exhibition.

605
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,618
Ah, nonsense.
We all have nerves.

606
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,923
You have been overworking.
Don't you think so, Rossner?

607
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,692
You need a rest. Your health
is very important to us.

608
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:39,235
Oh, that's very considerate.
I am very tired.

609
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:43,397
So, now I think perhaps
if you'll make my pardon...

610
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,772
to the ladies, Alex, for my
leaving so early, then I

611
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:50,335
Maybe, Emil, it would be better
if I came with you.

612
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,245
I think that perhaps
if you try to drive yourself...

613
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,114
all the way up to Petropolis,
it might be too much for you.

614
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,279
I shall drive you.

615
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,948
No. That would be
too much for you.

616
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,219
All that way.
That's too much to ask.

617
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,295
Nonsense.
I'd love to go.

618
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,558
Come on, Emil.
Good night, gentlemen.

619
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,496
Good night, Alex.

620
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,570
I hope you'll feel better
in the morning, Emil.

621
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,070
Thank you.
And I'm very sorry...

622
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,835
to make a scene
before strangers.

623
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,876
Very sorry.

624
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,139
Thank you, Alex,
for an excellent dinner.

625
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,876
And please tell your mother
for me that the dessert was superb.

626
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,754
Crowd Cheering

627
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,090
Miss Huberman has
been gone a long time.

628
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:44,395
Mother, is it necessary for you to
always address Alicia as Miss Huberman?

629
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,731
I do wish you'd be
a little more cordial to her.

630
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,203
Really, I thought I was
behaving rather well.

631
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,365
Has she been complaining about me?
Oh, no.

632
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,171
I'm grateful.
You might smile at her.

633
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,975
Wouldn't it be a little too much if
we both grinned at her like idiots?

634
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,311
Please, Mother,
I want to enjoy myself.

635
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,749
Is it so boring
to sit with me alone?

636
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,151
Not at all, not at all.

637
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,660
Hello.
Oh, hello.

638
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,856
I thought I saw you.
How are you?

639
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:18,196
Fine, thanks.
Great turnout, isn't it?
Yes.

640
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,863
Where are they?
In a box in the stand.

641
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,998
I don't think they can see us,
Alex and his mother.

642
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:29,044
Don't telephone me anymore.
Just rely upon my popping up.

643
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,774
Can you hear me?
Sure. Go ahead.

644
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:35,045
Heard of a Dr. Anderson?

645
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,882
No.
He's some kind of a scientist.

646
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:42,891
Kind face, 60 years old, gray hair,
deep crease in forehead.

647
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,894
Tall or short?
Short.

648
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,590
Uh-huh.
Emil Hupka? Heard of him?

649
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,599
No.

650
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:55,365
He made quite a scene
about a wine bottle the other night.

651
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,372
Didn't like the vintage?

652
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,375
He seemed to think there was
something else in the bottle.

653
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,913
Was there?
No. It was wine. We drank it.

654
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:07,074
Has he pulled anything since?

655
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,652
Haven't seen him since.

656
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:15,850
Anything else?
Nothing important.

657
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:19,690
Just a minor item that
you may want for the record.

658
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:21,696
What is it?

659
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,562
You can add Sebastian's name
to my list of playmates.

660
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,940
Pretty fast work.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

661
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,943
Skip it.

662
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,611
Are you betting on this race?
No.

663
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,549
Alex says number ten is sure to win.
He knows the owner.

664
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,554
Thanks for the tip.
Alex says they have been
holding him back all season

665
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,715
I can't help recalling
some of your remarks.

666
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:50,918
About being a new woman.
Daisies and buttercups, wasn't it?

667
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,428
You idiot.
What are you sore about?

668
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,464
You knew very well
what I was doing.

669
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,624
Did I?
You could have stopped me
with one word.

670
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:59,827
But no, you wouldn't.
You threw me at him.

671
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,236
I threw you at nobody.
Didn't you tell me to go ahead?

672
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,968
A man doesn't tell a woman
what to do. She tells herself.

673
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:09,568
You almost had me believing in that
little hokey-pokey miracle of yours

674
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,376
that a woman like you
could ever change her spots.
Oh, you're rotten.

675
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,280
That's why I didn't stop you.
The answer had to come from you.

676
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,546
I see.
Some kind of love test.

677
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,554
That's right.

678
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,250
You never believed in me anyway,
so what's the difference?

679
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,328
Lucky for both of us I didn't.
It wouldn't have been pretty
if I'd believed in you.

680
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,523
If I'd figured, "She'd never be able
to go through with this.

681
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,862
She's been made over by love. "

682
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:35,371
If you only once had said
that you loved me. Oh, Dev.

683
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,407
Listen. You chalked up another
boyfriend, that's all. No harm done.

684
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:42,205
I hate you.
There's no occasion to.
You're doing good work.

685
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:46,043
Number ten's out in front. Looks as if
Sebastian knows how to pick 'em.

686
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,879
Is that all you have
to say to me?

687
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,716
Dry your eyes, baby.
It's out of character.

688
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,416
Except, keep on your toes.
It's a tough job we're on.

689
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,787
Snap out of it.
Here comes dreamboat.

690
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,821
Oh, hello, Alex.
It was so exciting.

691
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,231
A beautiful horse.
Do you remember Mr. Devlin?

692
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,235
How do you do?
Hello.

693
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,568
Alicia tells me you had a bet
on number ten. Sorry I didn't
get the tip earlier.

694
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,074
So long.
See you sometime, Dev.

695
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,770
It was a wonderful race.
Did you have much money on the winner?

696
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,779
I didn't see the race.
Didn't you?

697
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,349
I thought I saw you looking
through your field glasses.

698
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,078
I was watching you
and your friend, Mr. Devlin.

699
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,746
I presume that's why
you left my mother and me.

700
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,416
You had an appointment to meet him.
Don't be absurd.

701
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,393
I met him purely by accident.
You didn't seem very anxious
to get away from him.

702
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,397
Oh, he's just
I watched you.

703
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:38,229
I thought maybe
you're in love with him.

704
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,031
Don't talk like that.
I detest him.

705
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,232
Really?
He's very good-looking.

706
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:49,040
Alex, I've told you before.
Mr. Devlin doesn't mean a thing to me.

707
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,979
I'd like to be convinced.

708
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:56,849
Would you maybe care to convince me,
Alicia, that Mr. Devlin
means nothing to you?

709
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,115
Car Horn Honks

710
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:04,682
...pleased to hear, Senor Barbosa, that
our little theatrical plan is working.

711
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,127
We've got hold of something
concrete for a change.

712
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,323
I'm delighted, gentlemen.
What is it?

713
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,459
Professor Wilhelm Otto Rensler
is working here in Brazil.

714
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,697
One of Germany's scientific wizards.
I didn't know he was here.

715
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,775
Oh, yes. He's living
and experimenting in Sebastian's house.

716
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,139
They call him Dr. Anderson.
Knocking

717
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,144
Entree.

718
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:28,274
Excuse me, sir. Miss Huberman wishes
to see Captain Prescott or Mr. Devlin.

719
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,910
What do you mean? She's here?
Yes, sir.

720
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,489
Beardsley
Well, show her in, Ribiero.
Yes, sir.

721
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,922
I don't like this.
I don't like her coming here.

722
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:39,154
She's had me worried for some time.
A woman of that sort.

723
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,924
What sort is that,
Mr. Beardsley?

724
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,969
Oh, I don't think any of us have
any illusions about her character,
have we, Devlin?

725
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,970
Not at all,
not the slightest.

726
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:52,337
Miss Huberman is first,
last and always not a lady.

727
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,605
She may be risking her life,
but when it comes to being a lady,

728
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:58,647
she doesn't hold a candle
to your wife, sir,

729
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:02,206
sitting in Washington playing
bridge with three other ladies
of great honor and virtue.

730
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,446
Take it easy, Dev.
Sorry.

731
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,954
I think those remarks
about my wife are uncalled-for.

732
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,584
Withdrawn. Apologized, sir.
Door Opens

733
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,158
How do you do, Miss Huberman?
How do you do?

734
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:19,235
This is Mr. Beardsley
and Senor Julio Barbosa.

735
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,304
Care to sit down?
Thank you.

736
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,872
You have the esteem
of my government, senorita.

737
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,169
But we are worried
about your visiting this office.

738
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:30,178
I promise not to break the rules
again, but I need some advice
and I couldn't find Mr. Devlin.

739
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,646
In fact, I need it before lunch.

740
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,740
Something happened?

741
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:37,319
Yes, something
rather confusing.

742
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,321
Mr. Sebastian
has asked me to marry him.

743
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,516
What?
Well, well.

744
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,527
He, he wants me
to marry him right away,

745
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,530
and I am to give him
my answer at lunch.

746
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,760
But I didn't know what the department
might think about such a step.

747
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:55,201
Are you willing to go this
far for us, Miss Huberman?

748
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,034
Yes, if you wish.

749
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,303
What do you think of this, Devlin?

750
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,408
Oh, I think it's a useful idea.

751
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,144
Well, you know the situation
better than any of us.

752
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,551
May I ask what inspired
Alex Sebastian to go this far?

753
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:15,318
He's in love with me.

754
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:18,326
And he thinks
you're in love with him?

755
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,057
Yes, that's what he thinks.

756
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,726
Barbosa
Gentlemen, it's the cream of the jest.

757
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:32,538
Then
Then it's all right?

758
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,874
Well, yes. I'd, I'd say so.

759
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,973
Of course, it's
a perfect marriage... for us.

760
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,575
There's only one thing.
Won't it delay us a bit?

761
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,746
Prescott
What do you mean?

762
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,484
Well, Mr. Sebastian is a very romantic
fellow, isn't he, Alicia?

763
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,686
Yes.

764
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:55,788
Then he'll probably want to take
his bride away for a long honeymoon.

765
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,697
Won't that hold us up?
Devlin's got a point there.

766
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,396
Oh, I don't know. I think
we can rely on Miss Huberman...

767
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,496
to get back
into the house quickly.

768
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,168
Yes, I think I can manage that.

769
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:11,036
Well, everything seems
to be nicely arranged.

770
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,548
I don't think you need me here anymore,
do you, Captain Prescott?

771
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:18,678
I do want to thank you,
Miss Huberman, very much.

772
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:22,884
I think so far everything has been
managed with great intelligence.

773
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,257
Barbosa
Yes. Thank you very much.

774
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:28,456
Are you quite sure she didn't
come down here to see you?

775
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:31,227
To capture the rich
Alex Sebastian for a husband?

776
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,894
Don't be absurd, Mother.
She didn't even know I was here.

777
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,529
We will discuss it
more fully tonight.

778
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,040
We will not discuss it tonight.

779
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:47,408
All these carping questions are merely
the expression of your own jealousy,

780
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,577
just as you've always
been jealous of any woman
I've ever shown any interest in.

781
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,882
In this case, there's
nothing more to discuss.

782
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:55,856
You mean, then, you are
going ahead with this marriage?

783
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,227
I mean that the wedding
will be next week.

784
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,389
It'll be private.

785
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:06,367
We shall both be pleased
to have you present, if you wish.

786
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,726
Knocking At Door

787
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,225
Oh.

788
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,304
Good evening, sir. Madame.
Good evening, Joseph.

789
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:45,636
Joseph. Joseph, it doesn't look
very cheerful in here.

790
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:48,711
I'm sorry, sir. Madame Sebastian
wasn't certain you'd be back tonight.

791
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,712
Why not?
I telegraphed her.

792
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,874
Madame Sebastian said
we were all to retire, sir.

793
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:57,919
Where is my mother?
Madame Sebastian
went to bed very early, sir.

794
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,787
I'm sorry, my dear. I'm afraid this
isn't a very bright homecoming for you.

795
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,086
That's all right, Alex.
Well, what shall we do?

796
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,560
Shall we have Joseph arrange
a little food for us?

797
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:09,188
Not unless you want to.
I'm rather tired myself.

798
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,563
We'll go right up, then?
Good night.

799
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,568
Good night, madame.

800
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,806
I'd like to have all my dresses
put out on the beds here.

801
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,707
Don't hang anything up.
I'd like to know where everything goes.

802
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,872
Oh, Joseph, would you
have the closets aired?
Yes, madame.

803
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,388
Oh, this isn't very large.
I'll need more room.

804
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,401
This door is locked.
That's used for a storeroom, madame.

805
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,802
Oh. May I have the key?

806
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,670
I do not have the keys, madame.
Where are they?

807
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:56,041
Madame Sebastian has charge
of all the house keys, madame.

808
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,314
Oh.

809
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,782
Do you know
where Mr. Sebastian is?

810
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:05,946
I believe he is having a business
meeting downstairs in the study, madame.

811
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:12,255
I miss Hupka. He was
a first-class metallurgist.

812
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,592
Leykin is just as good.

813
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,564
Such is your opinion.
But I don't want to criticize.

814
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:21,763
What, uh, were you asking?
Oh, you want a report.

815
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:25,272
A written report.
Well, my friends,

816
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,468
my work is done.

817
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:30,808
You've been successful.
Yes.

818
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,214
Oh, I'm very sorry. I
Not at all. Come on in.

819
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:44,225
No. I'm sorry to interrupt you.
I didn't know you were busy.

820
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:47,558
Some of the closets are locked.
Could you give me the keys?

821
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,224
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'd forgotten about the keys.

822
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:53,325
Of course.
I'll get them for you at once.

823
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:03,467
I'll bring the keys to you
right away, my dear.

824
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,879
Light Knocking
Mother? Mother?

825
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,213
Mrs. Sebastian
Come in.

826
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,753
Door Opens, Closes

827
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:14,323
Sebastian
Mother, Alicia wants the keys
to get into the closets.

828
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,621
Mrs. Sebastian
I think they can be safer
left to me. After all

829
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,127
Sebastian
Please, Mother, stop arguing!
Give me those keys!

830
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,131
Mrs. Sebastian
I will not. You won't get
these keys, and that's that.

831
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:27,465
Sebastian
Mother, will you please
give me the keys? Thank you.

832
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,009
Well, here they are.

833
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:43,449
Afraid I'm going to be busy
for the rest of the morning,
my dear.

834
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,454
See you at lunch.
Thank you, dear.

835
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,633
Mr. Sebastian
has the key for this, madame.

836
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,731
It's the wine cellar.

837
00:59:18,285 --> 00:59:21,345
Well, then, the wine cellar
is the obvious place to look.

838
00:59:21,454 --> 00:59:24,480
Car Horns Honking
Alex has the key to that.

839
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:26,491
Then get it from him.

840
00:59:26,593 --> 00:59:28,788
Get it? How?

841
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,125
Don't you live hear him?

842
00:59:32,766 --> 00:59:35,030
What do I look for
if I get the key?

843
00:59:35,135 --> 00:59:39,003
You look for a bottle of wine,
like the one that rattled
the fellow at dinner that night.

844
00:59:39,105 --> 00:59:42,734
All the bottles look alike to me.
I'm no mastermind.

845
00:59:42,842 --> 00:59:45,242
You're doing all right.

846
00:59:48,048 --> 00:59:50,073
It's no fun, Dev.

847
00:59:51,818 --> 00:59:54,548
Too late for that now,
isn't it?

848
00:59:54,654 --> 00:59:59,216
Look, uh, why don't you persuade
your husband to throw a large shindig...

849
00:59:59,326 --> 01:00:03,285
so that he can introduce his bride
to Rio society, say sometime next week?

850
01:00:03,396 --> 01:00:06,058
Why?
Consider me invited,

851
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:09,727
and I'll try and find out
about that wine cellar business.

852
01:00:11,471 --> 01:00:16,374
I don't think my husband is
interested in entertaining just yet.

853
01:00:16,476 --> 01:00:19,206
The honeymoon isn't over, huh?

854
01:00:21,014 --> 01:00:23,414
Don't underestimate
your charms, Mrs. Sebastian.

855
01:00:23,516 --> 01:00:25,416
You can handle it.

856
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:27,748
I don't think it's going
to be so easy about you.

857
01:00:27,854 --> 01:00:29,754
He thinks
you're in love with me.

858
01:00:29,856 --> 01:00:32,757
Well, then tell him you thought
if you invited me to the house...

859
01:00:32,859 --> 01:00:35,293
and I saw
how happily married you were,

860
01:00:35,395 --> 01:00:39,422
then the horrid passion I have
for you might be torn out of me.

861
01:00:39,532 --> 01:00:41,557
That sounds very logical.

862
01:00:41,668 --> 01:00:43,932
Good. Next week, then,
and get the key.

863
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:47,666
I have to fly up to Berlin,
but I'll be back in time.

864
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:49,674
All right.

865
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:52,006
I'll be looking forward
to seeing you.

866
01:00:52,112 --> 01:00:54,512
It's always a pleasure
meeting you, madame.

867
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:33,651
Sebastian I'm surprised
at Mr. Devlin coming tonight.

868
01:01:33,753 --> 01:01:37,245
I don't blame anyone for being
in love with you, darling.

869
01:01:37,357 --> 01:01:42,454
Il just hope that nothing will happen
to give him any false impression.

870
01:01:42,562 --> 01:01:44,757
I'll be with you in a minute.

871
01:01:54,207 --> 01:01:56,107
Darling.

872
01:01:59,913 --> 01:02:02,381
It's not that I don't trust you,
but when you're in love at my age,

873
01:02:02,482 --> 01:02:04,382
every man who looks
at a woman is a menace.

874
01:02:04,484 --> 01:02:07,612
Will you forgive me
for even talking about it?

875
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,086
I'm very contrite.

876
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:45,391
Orchestra: Waltz
Guests Chattering

877
01:02:45,426 --> 01:03:07,912
Orchestra: Waltz
Guests Chattering

878
01:03:07,947 --> 01:03:10,677
Well, I think we might join
the rest of the party now.

879
01:03:10,783 --> 01:03:13,843
I think all our guests are here.

880
01:03:21,494 --> 01:03:23,553
Where can I find Alex Sebastian?

881
01:03:23,663 --> 01:03:26,063
By the drawing room, sir.
Thanks.

882
01:03:42,749 --> 01:03:44,649
Hello, Dev.
Good evening.

883
01:03:53,226 --> 01:03:55,319
You haven't seen the house,
have you?

884
01:03:55,428 --> 01:03:57,328
Well, it's quite
a jolly, little cottage.

885
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,330
Let me show you
around the place.

886
01:03:59,432 --> 01:04:01,559
Later.
He's on the trail.

887
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:06,531
Devlin, glad to see you.
Good evening.

888
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:08,800
It was kind of your bride
to invite me.

889
01:04:08,908 --> 01:04:12,969
We both invited you, Mr. Devlin. See
that our guest is fed, my dear, amused.

890
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:16,173
You know what
Oh, excuse me.

891
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:18,682
Madame Esterich,
I'm so glad to see you.

892
01:04:21,854 --> 01:04:24,687
This isn't going to be easy.
Why?

893
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:27,021
He, uh... he's quite sensitive
about you.

894
01:04:27,126 --> 01:04:29,253
He's going to watch us
like a hawk.

895
01:04:29,362 --> 01:04:32,024
Yes, he's rather jealous
of anyone.

896
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:34,361
Where'd you get the key,
off his chain?

897
01:04:34,467 --> 01:04:36,367
Yes.

898
01:04:36,469 --> 01:04:40,428
Let's hope the liquor doesn't run out
and start him down the cellar for more.

899
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:43,168
Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
Quite a point.

900
01:04:47,714 --> 01:04:49,614
Thank you.

901
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:51,741
Oh, Mr. Devlin. How nice.
You remember me?

902
01:04:51,851 --> 01:04:55,116
Senora Ortiz.
How sweet. Young men
usually have short memories.

903
01:04:55,221 --> 01:04:57,781
Oh, here's something I adore
champagne.

904
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:59,790
Chuckling
Oh, may I?

905
01:05:07,634 --> 01:05:09,465
Cork Pops
Joseph?

906
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:12,970
Madame?
Do you think you have enough
champagne to last the evening?

907
01:05:13,072 --> 01:05:15,632
I don't know, madame.
I hope so.

908
01:05:33,326 --> 01:05:35,624
Enjoying yourself, Mr. Devlin?
Very much, thank you.

909
01:05:35,728 --> 01:05:38,128
There's so many things I would
like to ask about the States.

910
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:41,723
I haven't heard anything
for a long time.
I'll be glad to tell you.

911
01:05:41,834 --> 01:05:44,325
Will you excuse me?
Would you mind?

912
01:05:44,437 --> 01:05:46,337
Certainly.

913
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,141
Laughing

914
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,420
We better hurry.
Lots of time.

915
01:06:02,522 --> 01:06:05,116
No, Joseph might have
to ask Alex for more wine.

916
01:06:05,224 --> 01:06:07,249
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

917
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,955
He's running out
faster than he thought.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

918
01:06:11,064 --> 01:06:13,726
Laughing Continues
Is he, uh, watching?

919
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:16,131
Yes. You'd better go out
in the garden alone...

920
01:06:16,235 --> 01:06:19,671
and wait around back of the house for me
and I'll show you the wine cellar door.

921
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:33,513
Nice party, isn't it?
It's a wonderful party.

922
01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:36,247
And you're doing wonderfully well.
I'm very proud.

923
01:06:36,355 --> 01:06:40,815
Mr. Devlin bothering you much?
Oh, no, darling.
He's trying to drown his sorrow.

924
01:06:41,928 --> 01:06:43,725
Champagne Cork Pops

925
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:05,916
Man Speaking In French

926
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:25,365
Excuse me. I think I'll ask the
orchestra to play some Brazilian music.

927
01:07:25,471 --> 01:07:28,269
They've played waltzes all evening.
Go, my dear.

928
01:07:28,374 --> 01:07:30,604
Man Continues In French

929
01:07:49,462 --> 01:07:51,362
That's the door.
Right.

930
01:07:55,501 --> 01:07:58,664
I'll keep the garden door open,
and I'll tell you if anything happens.

931
01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:04,375
Orchestra: Brazilian Music

932
01:09:03,436 --> 01:09:05,165
Whispering
What happened?

933
01:09:06,272 --> 01:09:09,264
Look. Vintage sand.

934
01:09:11,477 --> 01:09:14,173
Hmm. We've got to leave things
as we found them.

935
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,272
Help me find a bottle of wine
with the same label as these others.

936
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:19,283
But it isn't really sand, is it?

937
01:09:19,385 --> 01:09:21,785
No, I think it's some kind
of metal ore.

938
01:09:36,168 --> 01:09:39,331
This is a bit weird.
I'm terrified.

939
01:09:39,438 --> 01:09:41,963
Just pretend you're a janitor.
Janitors are never terrified.

940
01:09:42,074 --> 01:09:43,974
I have a feeling
we're very slow.

941
01:09:44,076 --> 01:09:45,976
Well, we're on schedule.
Take it easy.

942
01:09:46,078 --> 01:09:49,844
I keep hearing someone coming.
Oh, that'll be nice.

943
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:55,219
Think if he comes down with Joseph.
Unfortunate.

944
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:12,236
Okay.

945
01:10:16,943 --> 01:10:18,843
Whispering
Come on.

946
01:10:25,284 --> 01:10:28,151
Whispering Continues
Someone is coming!

947
01:10:28,254 --> 01:10:30,449
It's Alex! He's seen us!

948
01:10:30,556 --> 01:10:32,854
Wait a minute. I'm going to kiss you.
No, he'd only think we'd

949
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,086
That's what
I want him to think.

950
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:42,724
You'd better stay upstairs,
Joseph. They may need you.

951
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:45,668
Yes, sir.

952
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:51,742
Sighing
Oh, Dev. Dev.

953
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:01,580
Whispers
Push me away.

954
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:08,392
I'm sorry to intrude
on this tender scene.

955
01:11:08,494 --> 01:11:10,758
Il couldn't help what happened.
He's been drinking.

956
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:14,026
Oh. So he carried you down here.

957
01:11:14,133 --> 01:11:16,897
Oh, please, Alex.

958
01:11:17,003 --> 01:11:19,995
You love him.
No, of course not. Please go.

959
01:11:20,106 --> 01:11:23,303
For what it's worth, as an apology,
your wife is telling the truth.

960
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:25,969
I knew her before you,
loved her before you.

961
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:28,842
But I wasn't as lucky as you.
Sorry, Alicia.

962
01:11:28,948 --> 01:11:31,041
Please go.
Good night.

963
01:11:36,055 --> 01:11:38,922
Sighs Alex, don't be foolish.
Il came down here...

964
01:11:39,025 --> 01:11:41,323
because he threatened to make a scene
unless I'd see him alone.

965
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:43,258
He kissed you.

966
01:11:43,362 --> 01:11:45,796
Il couldn't stop him.
I tried.

967
01:11:45,898 --> 01:11:48,458
We'll talk about it later.

968
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:50,933
Your guests are upstairs.

969
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:52,937
Will you please go to them?

970
01:12:01,547 --> 01:12:04,141
Oh, Mr. Devlin,
are you going so soon?

971
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,480
Yes, I'm afraid I have to be up
early in the morning.

972
01:12:06,585 --> 01:12:08,644
Thank you and good night.

973
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,525
Oh, Joseph.
Yes, sir.

974
01:12:14,627 --> 01:12:17,255
We can go down for the wine now.
Yes, sir.

975
01:12:39,819 --> 01:12:42,185
You know, Joseph,

976
01:12:42,288 --> 01:12:44,722
I don't think we need
give them any more champagne.

977
01:12:44,824 --> 01:12:47,622
We still have some upstairs,
haven't we?
Yes, sir.

978
01:12:48,894 --> 01:12:51,260
And some whiskey and wine?

979
01:12:51,363 --> 01:12:53,763
Yes, sir.
Well, I think we'll give them that.

980
01:12:53,866 --> 01:12:55,766
Very good, sir.

981
01:13:05,911 --> 01:13:07,811
I'm sorry
about what happened, Alex.

982
01:13:07,913 --> 01:13:12,748
Oh, my dear, I shall never
forgive myself for behaving
like a stupid schoolboy.

983
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:16,253
Then you believe me?
Well, of course.

984
01:13:16,355 --> 01:13:19,449
It isn't worth mentioning again.
Thank you.

985
01:13:19,558 --> 01:13:21,526
Are you coming up?
Not for a little while.

986
01:13:21,627 --> 01:13:23,925
Dr. Anderson's waiting for me
in the study.

987
01:13:24,029 --> 01:13:26,293
Sleep well.

988
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:29,060
It was a very successful party.

989
01:13:29,168 --> 01:13:31,102
Good night, then.
Good night.

990
01:13:31,203 --> 01:13:33,467
Thanks for being so nice.

991
01:14:07,873 --> 01:14:09,773
Bell Tolling

992
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:17,781
Tolling Continues

993
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:01,439
Mother.

994
01:17:03,048 --> 01:17:04,948
Mother.

995
01:17:12,991 --> 01:17:14,891
Why are you up so early?

996
01:17:17,096 --> 01:17:20,657
I need your help.
Something is wrong?

997
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:25,236
A great deal. Alicia.

998
01:17:29,408 --> 01:17:31,569
I have expected it.

999
01:17:31,677 --> 01:17:34,145
I knew. I knew.

1000
01:17:34,246 --> 01:17:36,942
What is it? Mr. Devlin?

1001
01:17:38,517 --> 01:17:39,916
No.

1002
01:17:44,656 --> 01:17:46,681
I am married
to an American agent.

1003
01:18:16,622 --> 01:18:20,217
Yes. It is easy to see now.

1004
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:23,624
I knew, but I didn't see.

1005
01:18:23,729 --> 01:18:25,629
They picked her
because of her father.

1006
01:18:25,731 --> 01:18:28,700
I must have been insane, mad,

1007
01:18:28,801 --> 01:18:31,827
behaved like an idiot to believe
in her with her clinging kisses.

1008
01:18:31,937 --> 01:18:34,201
Stop wallowing
in your foul memories.

1009
01:18:34,306 --> 01:18:36,740
Then what do I do?

1010
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:39,242
There's nothing to do.
I'm done, finished.

1011
01:18:42,247 --> 01:18:44,340
They'll find out.
They won't find out.

1012
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:46,350
They'll find out
what I'm married to.

1013
01:18:46,452 --> 01:18:49,319
Look what they did to Emil Hupka
Emil, who did nothing.

1014
01:18:49,421 --> 01:18:52,322
And I've betrayed them.
I've bungled, and there's no excuse.

1015
01:18:54,193 --> 01:18:57,060
I'd do the same myself
kill the fool that betrayed them.

1016
01:18:57,162 --> 01:18:58,925
There's no need
for them to find out.

1017
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:01,761
Mathis is very sharp.
Yes. He dislikes you.

1018
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:04,358
But his criticism of your
talents wouldn't go that far...

1019
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:07,530
to imagine that you are married
to an American agent.

1020
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:10,938
We are protected by
the enormity of your stupidity.

1021
01:19:11,043 --> 01:19:13,876
For a time.
Alicia. I'll take care of her myself.

1022
01:19:13,979 --> 01:19:18,109
No. Not that way.
I stood looking at her
when she was asleep.

1023
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:20,913
I could have
Quiet, Alex!

1024
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:26,681
You're almost as impetuous
as before your wedding.

1025
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:29,124
You barred me from that episode.

1026
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:31,423
Let me arrange this one.

1027
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:35,159
Listen to me.
No one must know what she is.

1028
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:39,328
There must be no suspicion
of her, of you or me.

1029
01:19:39,438 --> 01:19:42,407
She must be allowed
to move about freely.

1030
01:19:42,508 --> 01:19:44,635
But she will be on a leash.

1031
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:48,201
She will learn
nothing further to inform.

1032
01:19:48,313 --> 01:19:52,909
She must go,
but it must happen slowly.

1033
01:19:53,018 --> 01:19:55,316
If she could become ill...

1034
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:58,446
and remain ill for a time, until

1035
01:20:06,732 --> 01:20:10,429
Drink your coffee, darling.
It's getting cold.

1036
01:20:10,536 --> 01:20:12,629
Alicia
Are you going out this afternoon, Alex?

1037
01:20:12,738 --> 01:20:16,731
No, my dear. I have some letters
to write. What are you going to do?

1038
01:20:16,842 --> 01:20:19,470
Oh, I just have a little shopping.

1039
01:20:19,578 --> 01:20:22,274
I'd like to go to the Imperiale.
Maybe I'll go to Cosmo's...

1040
01:20:22,381 --> 01:20:24,349
and see if they have any new
books in from New York.

1041
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:28,749
If you're going there, will you go
and see if my cigars have arrived?

1042
01:20:28,854 --> 01:20:30,913
Should be about 1,000 of them.
If they have,

1043
01:20:31,023 --> 01:20:33,924
ask them to keep them in
the humidor for me, will you?

1044
01:20:37,496 --> 01:20:39,521
Prescott Anything wrong?
No.

1045
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:42,532
No, the light bothers me.
I have a bit of a headache.

1046
01:20:42,634 --> 01:20:44,966
Would you mind?
Oh, yes. I think we can fix that.

1047
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,061
Thank you.

1048
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:52,007
You know, some people get too much sun
down here. You must be careful.

1049
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:56,444
I think you can be very proud
of yourself, Mrs. Sebastian.

1050
01:20:56,548 --> 01:20:59,949
That sand that Devlin brought in
shows uranium ore.

1051
01:21:00,052 --> 01:21:01,952
So now we know
what we're driving at.

1052
01:21:02,054 --> 01:21:06,991
And your job from now on will be
to try to help us find out
where that sand comes from.

1053
01:21:07,092 --> 01:21:09,720
The location of the uranium
deposit is of vast importance,

1054
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:12,023
and we're putting
quite a few people on it.

1055
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:15,827
But I think you'll be of great help.
All right.

1056
01:21:15,934 --> 01:21:19,028
But that isn't
the main reason why I asked you
to come up here this afternoon.

1057
01:21:19,137 --> 01:21:21,367
No?
No. I wanted to tell you...

1058
01:21:21,473 --> 01:21:25,307
that I'm going to change
your contact in about a week.

1059
01:21:25,410 --> 01:21:27,435
Mr. Devlin's been transferred
to Spain.

1060
01:21:29,081 --> 01:21:31,242
To Spain?

1061
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:33,409
Does Mr. Devlin know that?
Oh, yes.

1062
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:35,543
He asked for the transfer.
Why?

1063
01:21:35,654 --> 01:21:38,054
Well, I guess he thought
he was going stale here.

1064
01:21:38,156 --> 01:21:40,454
Oh, he wants to leave Rio?

1065
01:21:40,559 --> 01:21:44,689
Yes. I guess he thought he'd
find... Spain more interesting.

1066
01:21:44,796 --> 01:21:47,060
Yes, I imagine it would be.

1067
01:21:47,165 --> 01:21:51,795
There really isn't very much
for a brainy fellow like Mr. Devlin
to do in Rio anymore.

1068
01:21:51,903 --> 01:21:54,463
Well, of course,
it is more or less routine now.

1069
01:21:56,341 --> 01:22:00,175
In the meantime, I am to report
to Mr. Devlin as usual?

1070
01:22:00,278 --> 01:22:03,213
Oh, yes. He'll be here
until the new man arrives.

1071
01:22:03,315 --> 01:22:05,875
Thank you, Captain Prescott.

1072
01:22:05,984 --> 01:22:08,282
I'll keep my ears wide open.
Goodbye.

1073
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:10,548
Goodbye.
Oh, and, uh...

1074
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:13,957
go easy on that sun, hey?

1075
01:22:25,971 --> 01:22:28,098
Daring, what is it?

1076
01:22:28,206 --> 01:22:30,731
I don't know. I
Are you in pain?

1077
01:22:30,842 --> 01:22:33,868
Yes, I
I'm so dizzy. I

1078
01:22:33,979 --> 01:22:35,879
Wh-What happened to her?

1079
01:22:35,981 --> 01:22:37,881
We were walking,
and she was stricken suddenly.

1080
01:22:37,983 --> 01:22:40,281
I'll be all right.
Let's go inside.

1081
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,440
I'm sorry
I couldn't make it on time.

1082
01:23:04,543 --> 01:23:07,478
It gets a bit lonely
squatting on a bench all day.

1083
01:23:07,579 --> 01:23:10,571
Yes, Rio can be a very dull town.

1084
01:23:10,682 --> 01:23:12,616
What's new?

1085
01:23:12,718 --> 01:23:14,948
Nothing.
What's new with you?

1086
01:23:15,053 --> 01:23:16,953
Nothing.

1087
01:23:19,191 --> 01:23:22,251
Any domestic troubles
about the other night?

1088
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,386
No.
Any footprints in that sand yet?

1089
01:23:25,497 --> 01:23:28,432
Sighs
No. Nothing yet.

1090
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:30,967
Just a social visit, huh?

1091
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:33,970
A little fresh air helps.

1092
01:23:35,207 --> 01:23:37,402
You don't look so hot.

1093
01:23:39,211 --> 01:23:41,202
Well
Sick?

1094
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:44,976
No. Hangover.

1095
01:23:47,853 --> 01:23:50,253
That's news.
Back to the bottle again, huh?

1096
01:23:50,355 --> 01:23:54,553
It sort of...
lightens my chores.

1097
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:57,423
Big party?
Just the family circle.

1098
01:23:57,529 --> 01:24:02,831
Sounds quite jolly.
It helps life in a dull town.

1099
01:24:02,934 --> 01:24:05,528
You ought to take it easy
on that liquor.

1100
01:24:07,105 --> 01:24:11,542
Don't you find Rio
a little hard to take too?

1101
01:24:13,078 --> 01:24:16,479
Not a bad town.

1102
01:24:16,581 --> 01:24:19,175
You look all mashed up.
Must have been quite an evening.

1103
01:24:20,285 --> 01:24:22,276
Yeah. It was.

1104
01:24:22,387 --> 01:24:25,584
Okay. If you wanna play
that way, go on. Have fun.

1105
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:29,091
No reason why you shouldn't.
That's right, Dev.

1106
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:32,061
Here's something that belongs to you.
I should have given it to you sooner.

1107
01:24:32,164 --> 01:24:35,361
What is it?
A scarf that you leant me once,

1108
01:24:35,467 --> 01:24:37,492
in Miami.

1109
01:24:42,073 --> 01:24:43,973
Cleaning house, huh?

1110
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:50,880
Well, goodbye, Dev.

1111
01:24:52,517 --> 01:24:55,577
What do you mean, "goodbye"?

1112
01:24:55,687 --> 01:24:58,622
Nothing. Just goodbye.

1113
01:24:58,723 --> 01:25:00,953
Fresh air isn't as good
for a hangover as I thought.

1114
01:25:01,059 --> 01:25:03,527
Sit down.
You're still tight.

1115
01:25:03,628 --> 01:25:05,528
I don't want to.

1116
01:25:06,798 --> 01:25:09,164
Where are you going?

1117
01:25:09,267 --> 01:25:11,394
Back... home.

1118
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:18,933
You are not taking care
of yourself, Alicia.

1119
01:25:19,044 --> 01:25:21,638
Oh, I feel much better.

1120
01:25:21,746 --> 01:25:23,771
You look like something awful.

1121
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,584
The circles under the eyes.

1122
01:25:29,888 --> 01:25:34,791
My dear child, you must have a doctor
find out what is the matter with you.

1123
01:25:34,893 --> 01:25:37,293
Alicia
I never go near doctors.

1124
01:25:37,395 --> 01:25:40,455
They always want
to cart you off to a hospital.

1125
01:25:40,565 --> 01:25:43,125
Dr. Anderson
Maybe you belong in a hospital.

1126
01:25:44,569 --> 01:25:48,801
Tell me.
When did you first feel sick?

1127
01:25:50,609 --> 01:25:52,509
Oh, II don't remember.

1128
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:55,444
Maybe the party... I think.

1129
01:25:55,547 --> 01:26:00,075
I still think a sea trip would
be much better for you, darling,
than doctors and hospitals.

1130
01:26:00,185 --> 01:26:03,086
A little cruise somewhere.
Maybe Spain?

1131
01:26:03,188 --> 01:26:05,088
Put the roses
back in your cheeks, my sweet.

1132
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,784
I don't think so.
I don't care much for boats.

1133
01:26:07,893 --> 01:26:09,724
We could go together, my dear,

1134
01:26:09,828 --> 01:26:12,888
if you could bear to leave Alex
behind for a few weeks.

1135
01:26:12,998 --> 01:26:15,899
I think I'd prefer Alex
to a case of seasickness.

1136
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:21,002
I always get seasick.

1137
01:26:21,106 --> 01:26:25,236
Then you might like
the mountains, hmm?

1138
01:26:25,343 --> 01:26:28,312
The air is fresh and pure and...

1139
01:26:28,413 --> 01:26:30,313
I am going next week.

1140
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:33,942
Oh, you're leaving?
I'm sorry. I'll miss you.

1141
01:26:34,052 --> 01:26:38,011
Yes. I'm delaying my work
too long.

1142
01:26:38,123 --> 01:26:42,753
If you'll come with me,
the mountains won't make you seasick.

1143
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:47,025
And the Imorez Mountains are beautiful
covered with flowers and

1144
01:26:47,132 --> 01:26:51,000
Oh, um, what Alicia needs
is rest, not mountain-climbing.

1145
01:26:51,102 --> 01:26:53,696
I've heard about the Imorez.

1146
01:26:53,805 --> 01:26:55,705
Did you? Really?

1147
01:26:55,807 --> 01:26:58,776
Mmm, yes.

1148
01:26:58,877 --> 01:27:01,505
About the beautiful
little native towns.

1149
01:27:01,613 --> 01:27:03,911
Tell me,
are you going to Leopoldina?

1150
01:27:04,015 --> 01:27:06,279
No, no, no.
I'm going to Santa Ma

1151
01:27:06,384 --> 01:27:07,942
Care for some more brandy,
Otto?

1152
01:27:08,053 --> 01:27:11,113
No, no, thank you.

1153
01:27:11,222 --> 01:27:14,680
I, er, never drink more than one brandy,
and even this is sometimes too much.

1154
01:27:14,793 --> 01:27:16,784
I'll just finish my coffee.

1155
01:27:16,895 --> 01:27:19,159
No, that is not your cup!
But that's Ali

1156
01:27:20,432 --> 01:27:22,525
Oh, I'm sorry.

1157
01:27:22,634 --> 01:27:26,263
Yeah, perhaps, uh,
Alex is right, my dear child.

1158
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:28,737
When you're young,
rest's the best doctor.

1159
01:27:30,575 --> 01:27:34,136
And if you...
lie still for a few days,

1160
01:27:34,245 --> 01:27:37,476
reading, relaxing,
forgetting all your troubles,

1161
01:27:37,582 --> 01:27:41,518
it might be as well as medicine
or sea air.

1162
01:27:41,619 --> 01:27:43,985
When I come back,
you will be all well,

1163
01:27:44,089 --> 01:27:45,989
making us all very happy once more.
Gasping

1164
01:27:46,091 --> 01:27:47,991
Gasping Continues
Oh!

1165
01:27:51,863 --> 01:27:54,855
Excuse me, II want to go to bed.
I feel

1166
01:27:54,966 --> 01:27:58,925
Pain again, darling?
I'm sorry to complain again.

1167
01:28:00,939 --> 01:28:03,737
Shall I take you
up to your room?

1168
01:28:03,842 --> 01:28:05,742
May I help you, my dear?

1169
01:28:05,844 --> 01:28:08,677
Some hot water, maybe?

1170
01:28:10,515 --> 01:28:13,848
Gasps
No. No, please. Don't bother.

1171
01:28:13,952 --> 01:28:16,250
I'll be all right.

1172
01:28:16,354 --> 01:28:19,755
If she doesn't feel better in the
morning, I insist you call a doctor.

1173
01:28:19,858 --> 01:28:22,383
I don't like
the way she looks, Alex.

1174
01:28:22,494 --> 01:28:24,962
I'm worried about her.

1175
01:28:25,063 --> 01:28:26,963
I'm afraid she's very ill.

1176
01:28:27,065 --> 01:28:30,796
Chattering Continues, Indistinct

1177
01:28:49,888 --> 01:28:51,788
Gasping

1178
01:28:56,327 --> 01:28:58,591
Alicia! Alicia!
Joseph. Joseph.

1179
01:28:58,696 --> 01:29:01,494
Help me take her up to her room.
You must take her up to bed.

1180
01:29:01,599 --> 01:29:03,999
Come on, my dear.

1181
01:29:10,442 --> 01:29:12,842
Okay. I told you she is sick.

1182
01:29:12,944 --> 01:29:15,572
Come on.
Don't exert yourself. Come.

1183
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:18,171
Be quiet.

1184
01:29:18,283 --> 01:29:22,515
No! Go! Go away!
No! No!

1185
01:29:32,063 --> 01:29:34,531
Chattering, Indistinct
No, I don't want to go.

1186
01:29:34,632 --> 01:29:37,692
It's some sort of spasm.
I'm sure it's not serious.

1187
01:29:37,802 --> 01:29:39,827
We must get a doctor.

1188
01:29:39,938 --> 01:29:42,930
Poor child is suffering too much.
I'll call the hospital.

1189
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:45,635
I'll get a doctor.
Don't worry, dear Otto.

1190
01:29:45,743 --> 01:29:47,734
We'll get a doctor
a good one.

1191
01:29:47,846 --> 01:29:50,246
We'll take
the best care of her.

1192
01:29:50,348 --> 01:29:53,010
Sighing

1193
01:29:53,118 --> 01:29:55,814
Sebastian
Joseph, disconnect the telephone.

1194
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,150
Madame must have absolute quiet.

1195
01:29:58,256 --> 01:30:00,156
Take it out of the room, Joseph.

1196
01:30:03,061 --> 01:30:04,961
Car Horns Honking

1197
01:30:27,852 --> 01:30:29,683
Five days, eh?

1198
01:30:29,787 --> 01:30:33,587
Say, that must be
quite a binge she's on.
I don't think so.

1199
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:36,751
Well, you said she was drinking
last week and drunk when you saw her.

1200
01:30:36,861 --> 01:30:40,160
Yes, but I've had time
to think it over.
Think what over?

1201
01:30:40,265 --> 01:30:42,825
That drinking of hers.
I don't believe it.

1202
01:30:42,934 --> 01:30:45,767
Why should she lie to you
about that?

1203
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:47,770
I don't know.
She wasn't drunk.

1204
01:30:47,872 --> 01:30:51,000
She was sick.
Maybe that's why she hasn't shown up.

1205
01:30:51,109 --> 01:30:53,009
She looked like
the ragged end of nowhere.

1206
01:30:53,111 --> 01:30:54,908
Well, it still sounds
like a hangover.

1207
01:30:55,013 --> 01:30:57,447
Yes, but I'm gonna pay her a call.
Now, wait a minute.

1208
01:30:57,549 --> 01:31:01,383
I don't want you to mess
things up. We hope to close
this case out in a few days.

1209
01:31:01,486 --> 01:31:04,114
I won't mess anything up.
Just a social call.

1210
01:31:04,222 --> 01:31:06,087
I, uh, I'm a friend
of the family.

1211
01:31:06,191 --> 01:31:09,558
All right. Go ahead if you want to,
but don't take any chances.

1212
01:31:09,661 --> 01:31:12,391
Oh, and, uh, call me up
when you get back.

1213
01:31:12,497 --> 01:31:14,590
I'll do that.
'Kay.

1214
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:42,058
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.

1215
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,685
Family home tonight?
Yes, sir.

1216
01:31:44,796 --> 01:31:48,061
Would you mind telling Mr. Sebastian
that Mr. Devlin is here?

1217
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,866
What is it, Joseph?
I'm very sorry, sir,

1218
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:56,100
but since Mr. Sebastian asked me
not to disturb him, I don't know.

1219
01:31:56,207 --> 01:31:58,107
Asleep?
No, sir.

1220
01:31:58,209 --> 01:32:00,609
He's in the study with
some business associates, sir.

1221
01:32:00,712 --> 01:32:02,942
How long do you think
he'll be tied up?
I don't know, sir.

1222
01:32:03,047 --> 01:32:05,982
Mrs. Sebastian home?
Uh, yes, sir.

1223
01:32:06,084 --> 01:32:08,644
Would you mind telling her?
I'm afraid I can't, sir.

1224
01:32:08,753 --> 01:32:12,553
Why not?
Mrs. Sebastian is very ill
and confined to her bed.

1225
01:32:14,259 --> 01:32:16,750
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
How long has she been ill?

1226
01:32:16,861 --> 01:32:19,056
A week.
Has she had a doctor?

1227
01:32:19,163 --> 01:32:22,997
I think so, sir.
We're all very concerned about her.

1228
01:32:23,101 --> 01:32:26,730
If you will wait here, Mr. Devlin,
I'll tell Mr. Sebastian.

1229
01:32:26,838 --> 01:32:28,738
Right.

1230
01:32:35,647 --> 01:32:37,877
Excuse me, sir.
What is it, Joseph?

1231
01:32:37,982 --> 01:32:40,314
Mr. Devlin to see you, sir.

1232
01:32:40,418 --> 01:32:43,979
Oh. Tell him I'll be with him
in a minute, will you?

1233
01:32:44,088 --> 01:32:45,988
Yes, sir.

1234
01:32:47,592 --> 01:32:50,493
Go on, Professor.
This sounds serious to me.

1235
01:32:50,595 --> 01:32:53,428
To me also.
What happened Monday?

1236
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:55,431
Same thing.

1237
01:32:55,533 --> 01:32:58,229
When I left the bank,
a man was following me.

1238
01:32:58,336 --> 01:33:01,533
But this morning, when I went
to the ticket office,

1239
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:04,870
the same man came inside
and stood beside me.

1240
01:33:54,826 --> 01:33:56,726
Door Closes

1241
01:34:11,509 --> 01:34:13,875
Alicia. Alicia.

1242
01:34:18,449 --> 01:34:20,417
Weakly
Dev.

1243
01:34:21,686 --> 01:34:23,586
Alicia,
what's wrong with you?

1244
01:34:23,688 --> 01:34:25,849
I'm so glad you came.

1245
01:34:27,992 --> 01:34:31,621
I had to.
I couldn't stand any more...

1246
01:34:31,729 --> 01:34:33,720
waiting and worrying about you.

1247
01:34:34,899 --> 01:34:37,424
That wasn't a hangover
you had that day.

1248
01:34:37,535 --> 01:34:40,527
You were sick then.
What is it?

1249
01:34:40,638 --> 01:34:42,697
Yes, I was sick.

1250
01:34:44,242 --> 01:34:46,676
What's wrong with you, Alicia?

1251
01:34:46,778 --> 01:34:50,214
Oh, Dev.
What is it, dear?
What's wrong with you?

1252
01:34:52,383 --> 01:34:54,510
They're poisoning me.

1253
01:34:54,619 --> 01:34:57,213
I couldn't get away from them.

1254
01:34:57,321 --> 01:34:59,414
I tried, but I was too weak.

1255
01:34:59,524 --> 01:35:01,424
How long?

1256
01:35:02,727 --> 01:35:05,195
Since the party.

1257
01:35:05,296 --> 01:35:07,628
Alex and his mother found out.

1258
01:35:12,103 --> 01:35:14,230
Come on. Try and sit up.

1259
01:35:14,338 --> 01:35:17,501
Sit up. I'm going
to get you out of here.

1260
01:35:17,608 --> 01:35:20,202
I thought you had gone.

1261
01:35:20,311 --> 01:35:23,769
No. I had to see you once,
speak my piece.

1262
01:35:23,881 --> 01:35:26,372
I was getting out
because I love you.

1263
01:35:26,484 --> 01:35:28,884
I couldn't bear
seeing you and him together.

1264
01:35:35,993 --> 01:35:38,154
Oh, you love me.

1265
01:35:38,262 --> 01:35:41,163
Why didn't you tell me before?

1266
01:35:41,265 --> 01:35:43,165
I know.

1267
01:35:43,267 --> 01:35:45,735
But I couldn't see straight
or think straight.

1268
01:35:46,871 --> 01:35:50,671
I was a fatheaded guy,
full of pain.

1269
01:35:50,775 --> 01:35:52,675
It tore me up not having you.

1270
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,580
Oh, you love me.

1271
01:35:58,816 --> 01:36:00,716
Oh, you love me.

1272
01:36:00,818 --> 01:36:03,150
Long ago. All the time,
since the beginning.

1273
01:36:07,592 --> 01:36:09,492
Here, put on your robe.

1274
01:36:11,295 --> 01:36:13,786
Come on.
Yes.

1275
01:36:13,898 --> 01:36:16,128
Try to sit up.
Yes.

1276
01:36:17,969 --> 01:36:20,301
Oh, Dev. I'm afraid...

1277
01:36:20,404 --> 01:36:25,000
I can't make it because
they gave me pills to sleep.

1278
01:36:25,109 --> 01:36:27,669
Keep awake. Keep talking.

1279
01:36:27,778 --> 01:36:30,338
Yes.
Have you got a coat?

1280
01:36:30,448 --> 01:36:32,746
In the closet.

1281
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:35,512
They didn't want
the others to know about me.

1282
01:36:42,426 --> 01:36:44,326
Keep talking.

1283
01:36:48,533 --> 01:36:51,024
Go on. What happened?

1284
01:36:51,135 --> 01:36:54,161
What happened?
Alex found out.

1285
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:58,936
And the others haven't?
They'd kill him if they knew.

1286
01:36:59,043 --> 01:37:01,511
They killed Emil.

1287
01:37:01,612 --> 01:37:05,571
Are you in pain?
I don't know. The pills.

1288
01:37:05,683 --> 01:37:07,708
Give me your feet.
Yes.

1289
01:37:09,487 --> 01:37:12,354
Say it again.
It keeps me awake.

1290
01:37:12,456 --> 01:37:15,050
I love you.

1291
01:37:15,159 --> 01:37:17,252
Stand up. Stand up.

1292
01:37:17,361 --> 01:37:20,853
Oh.
Come on. Wake up. Talk.

1293
01:37:20,965 --> 01:37:24,230
Dr. Anderson

1294
01:37:24,335 --> 01:37:26,269
Go on, go on. Walk, talk.

1295
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:31,034
The sand comes
from the Imorez Mountains.

1296
01:37:31,142 --> 01:37:33,042
We'll find it.

1297
01:37:33,144 --> 01:37:35,942
From a town
Santa Ma-something.

1298
01:37:36,047 --> 01:37:38,174
Good girl.
We'll take care of it later.

1299
01:37:38,282 --> 01:37:40,546
Come on. Keep awake. Keep walking.
Oh, I'm afraid!

1300
01:37:40,651 --> 01:37:43,552
Dev, I'm afraid. They're all
in the house. We can't make it.

1301
01:37:51,128 --> 01:37:53,460
Oh, don't ever leave me.

1302
01:37:53,564 --> 01:37:55,964
You'll never
get rid of me again.

1303
01:37:57,234 --> 01:37:59,600
Never tried to.

1304
01:37:59,704 --> 01:38:01,501
Brace up. Here he comes.

1305
01:38:06,744 --> 01:38:09,975
What are you doing, Alicia?
What is this, Mr. Devlin?

1306
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:12,811
I'm taking her to the hospital
to get the poison out of her.

1307
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:16,353
Poison?
How'd you like your friends
downstairs to know?

1308
01:38:16,454 --> 01:38:18,888
They've yet to be told.
I'm taking her back to her room.

1309
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:21,652
No, Dev. I'll raise
quite a rumpus, if you try.

1310
01:38:21,759 --> 01:38:25,024
Alex. He knows?

1311
01:38:25,129 --> 01:38:27,063
Yes.
Dr. Anderson
What is happening, Alex?

1312
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,796
Alicia!
She is worse?

1313
01:38:31,902 --> 01:38:33,961
Mrs. Sebastian Yes.
Go.

1314
01:38:34,071 --> 01:38:36,301
All right, dear.
We're going. We're going.

1315
01:38:36,407 --> 01:38:39,865
You haven't forgotten what they did
to Emil, have you, Sebastian?

1316
01:38:42,847 --> 01:38:45,645
Whispering
Help him, Alex.

1317
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,548
I'm glad you
have a head on you, madame.

1318
01:38:48,653 --> 01:38:51,315
I'm not afraid to die.

1319
01:38:51,422 --> 01:38:54,482
You've got your chance here and now.
Tell them who she is.

1320
01:38:55,926 --> 01:38:58,520
Need any help, Alex?

1321
01:38:58,629 --> 01:39:00,927
No, we can handle her.
Where are you taking her?

1322
01:39:03,601 --> 01:39:07,059
You answer that one, Sebastian.
To the hospital.

1323
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:09,571
Whispering
Alex, talk to them, quick!

1324
01:39:14,679 --> 01:39:16,613
Glad she's going.

1325
01:39:16,714 --> 01:39:18,614
You should not have waited
so long, Alex.

1326
01:39:21,318 --> 01:39:23,684
Well, what am I going to do,
start shooting?

1327
01:39:26,057 --> 01:39:28,184
Hold on. You've only got
about 20 yards to go.

1328
01:39:28,292 --> 01:39:31,056
What happened, Alex?
Hmm?

1329
01:39:32,663 --> 01:39:37,259
Oh, um... she collapsed.

1330
01:39:37,368 --> 01:39:41,634
Mr. Devlin heard her scream when he
was waiting for me. Come on, Alicia.

1331
01:39:41,739 --> 01:39:45,573
Yes, I telephoned the hospital
as soon as I saw how she was.

1332
01:39:45,676 --> 01:39:47,644
You have a car? You heard, Alex.
Out in front.

1333
01:39:47,745 --> 01:39:49,736
You're going with them, madame?

1334
01:39:49,847 --> 01:39:53,783
No. Alex will call me up.
I'll wait here.

1335
01:39:53,884 --> 01:39:56,318
Chatters, Indistinct

1336
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:58,320
Poor child.

1337
01:40:00,758 --> 01:40:03,556
How do you feel?
A bit dizzy.

1338
01:40:03,661 --> 01:40:06,152
Take some deep breaths.
Just hurry, hurry.

1339
01:40:17,374 --> 01:40:20,571
Now just a minute.
I must sit with her!
No room, Sebastian.

1340
01:40:20,678 --> 01:40:23,112
But you must take me.
They're watching me.
That's your headache.

1341
01:40:23,214 --> 01:40:24,613
Engine Starts
Please take me! Please!

1342
01:40:24,715 --> 01:40:27,775
Please! Please!

1343
01:40:27,885 --> 01:40:31,685
There is no telephone
in her room to call the hospital.

1344
01:40:31,789 --> 01:40:35,190
Eric
Alex, will you come in, please?

1345
01:40:35,292 --> 01:40:37,192
I wish to talk to you.
