00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,805
Yeah.
Okay.

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,361
Well, it's all brown.

153
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,046
No, no, no,
there's a spot here.

154
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,486
Mm.

155
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,931
Ella, this is evidence of your
father stealing food from you.

or anorexic,

It's not my fault.

158

Don't blame it all on your mother.
Ella, this is a family apple.

159
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,046
I'm teaching you the value of sharing.
I love you, honey.

160
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,248
Aw. So sweet.

You will remember this vacation
different than we will.

162
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,568
That's for sure.
I see that with my mom.

163
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,166

different than I do.

Please, stop filming me.
Okay.

165

God. I love your mom.
You're always so hard on her.

166
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,528
You missed the fucked-up years.
You're just getting the good era.

167
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,048
The fucked-up years. Heh, heh. That
reminds me, talking about fucked up,

168
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,171
did I ever tell you the story
of my little Cleopatra kitty?

169
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,281
No.
No? I think you would remember if I did.

170
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,849
It's the story... You know, when I was a
little girl, I had this cat named Cleopatra.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,731
Every spring, she'd jump
the fence, get pregnant

172
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,010
and always end up
with a litter of exactly two kittens.

173
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,770
Two kitties, huh?
Two kitties.

174
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,928
Every time, every year,
two cats.

175
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,724
I mean, it's just amazing.

176
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,766
Then one day, I was, like, around 30,
and was having lunch with my dad

177
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,969
and I was remembering...
Mentioning little Cleopatra,

178
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,281
and he was like:

179
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,202
"The hardest thing I ever had to do
was to kill those cute little kittens."

180
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,606
And I was like, "What?"

181
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,531
It turns out... Listen to this.

182
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,644
There were sometimes
up to seven kittens in that litter.

183
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,887
Oh, no.

184
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,042
He would take five of them,
Oh, no.

185
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,407
Put them into a bag
with a bunch of ether.

186
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,688
That's terrible.

187
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,127
That was like...

188
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,449
He had forgotten the lie he
and my mom had told me as a kid.

189
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,729
How did he decide which ones to kill?
I asked him that.

190
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,447
"Did you take the fluffiest? Cutest?"
Right.

191
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,126
You know?
He just started to cry.

<font color="#808080">ACHILLEAS:</font> We drove around all night.

585
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,522
And then I had to drive her back
to the theater to get her stuff.

586
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,882
And it was dawn.
I'll never forget it.

587
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,409
It's outdoors and seats 12,000 people,
but it was now completely empty.

588
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,811
<font color="#808080">ACHILLEAS:</font> And she was sitting
way up in the back row.

589
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,040
So I went up on stage
and whispered to her...

590
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,403
Acoustics there are incredible.
I could see his mouth move

591
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,122
and then three seconds later,
I could hear his voice in my ear.

592
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,850
What did he say?

593
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,361
Oh! Okay.
Private. Private.

594
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,928
And then she had to fly back to Paris
a couple of days later.

595
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,766
How did you keep in touch?
We Skyped every day since then.

596
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,329
When we're apart, we have a thing
of putting our laptop by the pillow

597
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,170
and fall asleep together.

598
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,368
Oh, that's the new romance.
<font color="#808080">ALL:</font> Heh-heh-heh.

599

And when I wake up,
the screen is usually frozen.

600
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,605
And Anna's face
is in some funny position, like:

Do you go a little crazy?
Oh, God, you're being so vulgar.

606
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,087
I'm just being
an amateur anthropologist

607
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,124
interested in virtual worlds
on a theoretical level.

608

Yeah.

For instance, the sex of the near

610
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,049
but is gonna be just like plugging in,
attaching something to your genitals,

611
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,171
and you'll be having virtual intercourse
with anyone of your choice.

612

You'll be able to program in
all your preferences.

are going to take place
in the virtual world, you know?

619
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,045
You're a writer. How are you gonna
feel when a computer can write a book

620
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,885
better than <i>War and Peace?</i>
It'll never happen.

621
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,010
It's only a question about
when it's going to happen.

622
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,250
I think I'm gonna feel about it the same
way Kasparov felt when they could

623
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,449
no longer compete with that computer.
Big Blue.

624
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,365
Right. Nobody thought a computer
could beat our best.

625
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,127
"A machine lacks
that ineffable human instinct."

626
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,244
And then... You know,
and now we can't even compete.

627
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,081
I saw a documentary where they were
doing an experiment on a lab rat.

628
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,770
And he was wired up

629
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,930
and he could push a switch
and have an orgasm.

630
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,569
And so the scientists were sort of
laughing at this pathetic little creature

631
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,810
while it ignored his food and water
and didn't do anything else.

632
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,684
And eventually it just died.

633
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,247
I mean,
I think that's the future of humanity.

634

You know, just:<font color="#808080"> ALL:</font> Ha-ha-ha.

635

636
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,408
Well, well, maybe so,

637
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,686
but every generation believes that
they're witnessing the end of the world,

638
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,526
but I feel
that I'm actually living it.

639
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,248
Okay, I have a question for you, Patrick. I
think a lot of people are feeling that way.

640
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,842
That we're this kind of
pleasure-obsessed, porn-addled,

641
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,328
materialists,
ceding our humanity to technology

642
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,649
at the same moment that
computers are becoming sentient.

643
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,322
So, what my question is,
is this notion of self to begin with.

644
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,360
Well, it's written over the portals
to the temple of Apollo at Delphi.

645
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,605
It says, <i>"gnothi seauton"</i>,
which means "Know thyself."

646
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
But we're kind of 99 percent
automated already.

647
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,563
No. Our personality
or this thing we think of as ourself

648
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,326
is a tiny fraction
of what the brain is doing.

649
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,802
Most of it is automated body functions.
What is it we're ceding?

650
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,886
No, if this notion of self is such a
small percentage of you, sweetie,

651
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,407
how come I always hear
so much about it?

652
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,571
Well, just like my penis. It's not that big.
It's a small part of myself,

653
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,724
but it needs a lot of attention.
His too.

We kind of, sort of fell in love
a little bit, and then we...

662

A bit. Then we lost track of each other.
A decade later, we ran into each other.

how to keep a man.

at all the silly little games they like.
Oh, okay.

679
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,724
When I met Jesse, we were playing
pinball. I was winning.

680
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,121
The foundational lie
to our relationship.

681
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,290
I let the ball go down the middle.
She can't beat me.

682
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,885
It builds their confidence.

683
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,011
If I didn't let him win at every game,
we would never have sex.

684

I mean, I'm sorry to say it,
but he's actually a closet macho.

his lips, his teeth,

the texture of his skin, his hair.

00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,241
When he's in his 50's,

868
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,920
imaginary friend shows up again.
Hummingbird?

869
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,805
That one. It's funny.
Yeah. You like that one? Oh.

870
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,731
Remember that letter
that you let me read

871
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,685
that you wrote when you were 20
to yourself at 40?

872
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,327
I remember."Dear 40-year-old
Jesse, I hope you're not divorced."

873
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,366
I didn't remember that part. I meant
all the other things in that letter.

874
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,641
You're the same guy.

875
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,401
We always think we're evolving,
but we can't change that much.

876
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,040
Know how I think I've changed the most?
How?

877
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,885
When I was younger,
I just wanted time to speed up.

878
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,849
Why?
So I could be on my own,

879
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,646
be freed from parents, school,
all that shit.

880
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,009
I just wanted to close my eyes
and wake up and be an adult.

881
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,204
Now I feel that happened, and I
just want everything to slow down.

882
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,285
Mm. I've always had this feeling
no matter where I am in my life

883
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,161
that it's either a memory or a dream.
You've always thought that.

884
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,564
Me too. Like, is this really my life?
Like, is it happening right now?

885
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,524
It is. Ha-ha-ha.
I know. Heh, heh.

886
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,281
Every year, I seem to get a bit
more humbled and more overwhelmed

887
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,165
about things I'm never gonna
know or understand.

888
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,807
I keep telling you, you know nothing.
I know. I'm coming around.

889
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,724
But not knowing is not so bad.

890
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,091
I mean, the point is to be looking,
searching, to stay hungry, right?

891
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,851
It's true.
I just wish it was a little easier.

892
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,326
How do you mean?

893
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,410
Just to maintain a certain level
of passion, you know?

894
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,887
I mean,
it used to come so naturally.

895
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,801
I remember when I was younger, me and
all my writer friends, we, like...

896
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,482
It felt like we were doing something
important. This was our time.

897
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,047
But you were all arrogant
little pricks.

898
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,089
Heh. No. Well... All right, maybe.
Ha-ha-ha.

899
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,802
I don't know. It grew out
of all this energy and this creativity

900
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,002
or whatever ambitions people had.

901
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,131
I think you gotta be a little deluded
to stay motivated.

902
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,369
Young men have this thing
about comparing themselves.

903
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,689
They have all these signposts
they judge themself by.

904
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,207
You used to do that all the time.
Do what?

905
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,880
It was like, uh,
"Rimbaud wrote this by 17."

906
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,329
Oh, yeah, definitely. Balzac wrote a book
before breakfast, so what am I doing?

907
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,524
Women don't think that way as much.
You don't think so?

908
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,491
No. We have much less
to compare ourselves to maybe.

909
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,089
Women who achieve anything, first time you
hear about them, they're in their 50s.

910
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,443
It was so hard for them
to get any recognitions before then.

911
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,849
They struggled for 30 years
or they raised kids

912
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,886
and were stranded at home before they
could finally do what they want.

913
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,125
Actually, you know, it's kind of freeing.
We don't have to spend our lives

914
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,248
comparing ourselves
to Martin Luther King,

915
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,890
Ha-ha-ha.
Gandhi, Tolstoy.

916
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,690
What about Joan of Arc, right?

917
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,889
I mean, she was a teenager,
and she saved France, so...

918
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,447
Who wants to be Joan of Arc?
Forget France.

919
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,007
She was burned at the stake
and a virgin, okay?

920
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,401
Ha-ha-ha. Okay.
Nothing I aspire to.

921
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,410
What a great achievement.
Ha-ha-ha.

922
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,410
Oh, God.
What?

923
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,841
No, nothing.

924
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,408
What?
This is so weird. Ha, ha.

925
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,882
What do you mean?
Just this.

926
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,970
Us, walking,
having a conversation

927
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,925
about something else
than scheduling, food, work.

928
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,920
Yeah, how long's it been since we
just wandered around bullshitting?

929
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,888
Do you hear what I hear?

930
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,403
The sea?
No.

931
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,763
What? Oh, no small feet.
Mm-hm.

932
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,043
No... Nothing being knocked over,
nothing we have to clean up,

933
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,049
no injustices being done.

934
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,562
Yeah. So when was the last time?
Mm.

935
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,810
When we had nowhere we had to be?
Yeah.

936
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,727
Remember Luxembourg Gardens?
Yeah.

937
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,764
Used to kick your ass at Ping-Pong?
Congratulations.

938
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,843
You beat a woman pregnant
with twins.

939
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,890
It's better than losing
to a pregnant woman with twins.

940
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,407
Okay? Heh, heh.
Oh, God.

941
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,925
You know what I think?

942
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,051
From the time we leave our
parents' house until we have kids.

943
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,124
That's the only time your life
is completely your own.

944
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,607
I had about a decade of that.
It was great.

945
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,007
It was just like one long flowing...

946
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,049
A day, a week, a year.

947
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,403
There wasn't much difference.
I used to keep track of time.

948
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,565
Through jobs, boyfriends, stuff like that.
Now I can tell you every detail

949
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,446
of the past seven years based on what
was happening in the girls' lives.

950
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,641
Yeah, right. Totally.

951
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,689
You do that too?

952
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,685
Yeah. I mean, time's demarcated now.
Really?

953
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,444
What?
No, no, no. No, I just...

954
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,281
I'm surprised. I'm surprised you do that.
No, but... Okay, quick test.

955
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,761
Oh, no.
You know, August, 2009.

956
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,083
No, August... Come on. It's a quick one.
Why?

957
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,243
What was happening?
August...

958
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,402
We were on vacation
with your parents.

959
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,643
Nina got the chicken pox first,
quickly followed by Ella.

960
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,764
I'm so impressed.
So do I get a gold star?

961
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,923
Maybe.
Mm-hm.

962
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,366
Hey, can I ask you a question?
Sure.

963
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,043
If we were meeting for the first time today
on a train, would you find me attractive?

964
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,050
Of course.
No, but really, right now, as I am?

965
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,481
Would you start talking to me?

966
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,246
Would you ask me
to get off the train with you?

967
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,521
<font color="#D900D9">(BOTH LAUGH)</font>

968
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,650
Well, I mean, you're asking
a theoretical question.

969
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,561
What would my life situation be?
Wouldn't I be cheating on you?

970
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,603
Why can't you just say yes?
I did.

971
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,770
I wanted you to say something
romantic and you blew it.

972
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,930
Okay, all right, wait,
if I saw you on a train,

973
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,686
I would lock eyes with you, walk up to you
Uh-huh.

974
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,126
And say, "Hey, baby."

975
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,204
"You are making me as horny
as a billy goat in a pepper patch."

976
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,886
Aah! Stop it! That's disgusting!

977
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,290
Billy goat? No. The truth is,
okay, you failed the test.

978
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,051
The fact is, you would not
pick me up on a train.

979
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,720
Would not notice
a fat-assed middle-aged mom

980
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,924
losing her hair.
Okay. Losing... Ha-ha-ha.

981
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,127
Yeah, that's me.

982
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,607
You set me up to fail on this one.

983
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,167
Okay, true, true, true.
You did. All right.

984
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,769
But in the real world, baldy, okay,
on game day when it mattered,

985
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,284
I did talk to you on a train, okay?
I did. It was the best thing I ever did.

986
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,209
Really? Look at the goats.
Hey.

987
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,243
<font color="#808080">CELINE:</font> Hello.
<font color="#808080">JESSE:</font> Yeah.

988
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,285
But, heh, you know,
that's not even a good question.

989
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,724
The real question would be,
if I did ask you to get off a train,

990
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,883
Yeah?
Would you get off with me?

991
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,367
Of course not.
I have people waiting for me.

992
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,282
You know, and, heh, heh,
a 41-year-old horny billy goat.

993
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,121
How creepy. I'm creeped out
right now. Help!

994
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,288
I can't believe I'm 41.

995
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,841
Yeah, me neither. You've gotten so old.
Heh.

996
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,441
I never thought I'd sleep
with anyone over 40.

997
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,405
Actually, you're the oldest guy
I've ever slept with.

998
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,922
That's something. I'm not the
oldest guy you've ever blown.

999
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,451
What?

1000
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,166
That conference in Warsaw.

1001
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,721
What conference?
Lech Walesa.

1002
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,524
Lech Walesa?

1003
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,762
Oh, what are you talking about?
It's okay.

1004
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,930
It was before we were together.
It's... You can admit it.

1005
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,409
I can remember the way you talked
about how he opened your heart.

1006
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,286
You definitely blew him. Definitely.
Oh, okay. You're really crazy.

1007
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,802
That was Gorbachev, okay,
you geographically-challenged,

1008
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,527
football-obsessed, doughnut-loving
American. That was Gorbachev.

1009
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,768
I got my Eastern bloc leaders
mixed up.

1010
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,121
And I didn't blow him

1011
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,971
at all. Okay? Take it back.
Okay, okay, okay.

1012
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,730
God.

Yeah. My dad texted me before we ate.

She took care of all of us.

I mean, she never said an
unkind word about anybody.

It's okay.

1031
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,011

wasn't into meeting new people.

What was?

1185
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,401
No, no.
Anyway, he was this friend of mine

1186
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,321
that when he found out he had
leukemia and was probably gonna die,

1187
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,444
the first thing that came
to his mind was relief.

01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,051
Relief? At what?
Yeah.

1189
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,404
Before he found out he had nine months
to live, he was worried about money.

1190
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:44,401
And now his thought was, "I have enough
money to live nine months. I've made it."

1191
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,045
Oh, okay.
I mean...

1192
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:51,127
He was finally able to enjoy everything
about life, even being stuck in traffic.

1193
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,609
He would just enjoy looking at people,
staring at their faces, just little things.

1194
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,529
And then what happened?

1196
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,043
Well, like, is he still alive?

1197
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,891
No, he died a long time ago.

1198
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,168
Last night, I had this dream
where I was reading a book.

1199
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,806
Okay. It was a lost classic.

Is that a real book?

Okay.

<font color="#D900D9">(CELL PHONE CONTINUES CHIMING)</font>

1306
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,767
I said to call in case of emergency only.
I hope the girls are okay.

1307
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,851
Okay.

1308
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,321
Oh, it's Henry. Okay.

1309
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,488
Hey, sweetie, are you okay?

1310
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,769
Are you in London?

1311
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,366
Oh.

1312
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,650
Oh, already? Okay.

1313
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,971
Oh, no, no, we found it.

1314
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,648
We'll mail it tomorrow.
Don't worry. Yeah, yeah.

1315
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,723
Yeah. Oh, they miss you too.
I'll kiss them for you.

1316
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,609
Yeah.

1317
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,763
Okay, I'll tell him.

1318
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,246
Good luck with your mom.

1319
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,920
Yeah. I love you too. Bye.

1320
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,764
Okay.

1321
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,886
Okay.

1322
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,488
He's fine. He says he'll call you
from Chicago when he lands.

1323
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,331
Why can't I talk to him?
Twice you've done that.

1324
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,602
You could have just
handed me the phone.

1325
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,962
He didn't have time.
They were boarding.

1326
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,446
What did he forget?

1327
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,201
His science project.
But we'll mail it tomorrow. It'll be fine.

1328
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,482
Shouldn't have said that
about his mom.

1329
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,803
What? What did I say?
"Good luck with your mom."

1330
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,207
Heh. Come on.
I didn't mean anything by it.

1331
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,530
I know, but it's not good. It reminds him.
And I wish you wouldn't do that.

1332
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,123
That's so American to just swipe it under
the carpet and act as if it didn't happen.

1333
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,805
Why put it into his head?

1334
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,049
What if he doesn't wanna be
thinking about that right now?

1335
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,250
It means nothing.
It means something. It does.

1336
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,090
I made a joke the other day

1337
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,046
that his mom and I should settle it
in one big mud wrestling contest.

1338
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,971
Mud wrestling? You said that?
And he laughed.

1339
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,562
He might have more of a sense
of humor than you do. Come on.

1340
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,124
You say bad things about his morn,
he hears bad things about himself.

1341
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,689
I didn't say anything bad about his mom. I made a joke.
It's on me as it is on her.

1342
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,169
I know, I know. It's just,
why conjure it up at all, you know?

1343
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,885
I think he's old enough now.

1344
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,448
I mean, he knows how bad it is
between his mother and I.

1345
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,008
His mom and me. And I didn't do anything.
It's all from her.

1346
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,722
Okay, she hates me. Yes,
I fucked her husband a long time ago.

1347
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,684
Or should I say he fucked me?

1348
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,928
Heh. Yeah, right.
Okay.

1349
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,960
Making a joke that his mom and I
don't love each other is not the issue.

1350
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,964
That's not gonna traumatize him.
That already happened.

1351
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,124
And now you're trying
to transfer your guilt and blame me.

1352
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,327
No, I'm not.

1353
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:11,082
On the contrary, if he can joke about it,
maybe he'll be able to live with it better.

1354
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,161
Okay, you're right, as always.
Let's just not talk about it, okay?

1355
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:21,368
Mm-hm. Right. It's nobody's fault if his mom
is a drunk and abusive psychologically.

1356
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,443
Don't say that.

1357
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,887
It makes me sick
that he has to be with her.

1358
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,924
But judges assume
that women have the mother instinct.

1359
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,851
She has the mother instinct of Medea.

1360
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,445
Medea, huh?

1361
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,768
Yeah. After all, it is a Greek myth.

1362
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,883
Actually a play by Euripides, but...

1363
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,771
A woman killing her kids
to punish her ex-husband.

1364
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,651
That's what she's doing.
Hurting him to get to you.

1365
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,521
No, she's making my life hell
through him, that's what she's doing.

1366
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:52,203
And sometimes you say things
that just go too far.

1367
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,165
Stop blaming me
for everything wrong with your wife.

1368
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:59,046
Ex-wife, ex-wife. For a long time.
Okay.

1369
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,130
Should have dealt with it.
She wouldn't have hated us.

1370
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,527
Okay, okay, I screwed up.

1371
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,560
I just love this little re-write
you do

1372
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,448
that everything that isn't perfect
in our life gets laid at my feet.

1373
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,765
And now you're putting this shit
on me about Henry.

1374
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,122
What shit?
What are you talking about?

1375
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:23,008
Let me tell you what I'm talking about.
The moving to Chicago, giving up my life.

1376
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,491
<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>

1377
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,884
You mentioned that Henry needs you.
How do you think that makes me feel?

1378
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,003
I'm miserable. All right?

1379
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,248
How can I take that job now?
Okay.

1380
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,364
Tell me. I'll feel too guilty. No, no, no.
Come here.

1381
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,042
That's a choice you're making,
to look at it like that. All right?

1382
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,323
It is in the nature of women
to be the nurturer.

1383
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,449
The what?
The nurturer.

1384
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,723
The nurturer?
Okay, I can't even say that fucking word.

1385
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,642
I just naturally feel bad about everything.
And you give that look, like it's my fault.

1386
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,684
What look?
The I-forgot-the-science-project look.

1387
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,247
I know you blame me.
I didn't say anything.

1388
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,161
No, you didn't say anything.
You didn't have to. It's always my fault.

1389
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,249
Yeah, right.

1390
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,482

Wow. That's a sure sign from God.
Yeah.

1397
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,164
That line is so damn true, and it's been
for 10,000 years, but that's enough.

1398
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,289
I don't wanna be one of these women.

1399
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,127
Like marriage is important to gays,
or contraception to women rights.

1400
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,763
It's the same with giving up my hopes,
with women that had to give up hopes.

1401
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,885
I'm not gonna do it. This is bigger
than me. This means more than me.

1402
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,731
Wow. Bravo.
The Nobel Committee is taking note.

1403
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,884
I'm just... Hold on a second.
I'm gonna alert Sweden.

1404
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,527
It must be a full-time job carrying
that much feminine oppression.

1405
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,683
It is.
You suffered so much

1406
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,763
growing up in middle-class Paris.

1407
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,606
The agony in the trenches of
the Sorbonne in the post-feminist era.

1408
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,842
I can't imagine.
You're an asshole.

1409
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,523
You know what, sweetie,
when are we moving to Chicago?

1410
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,610
I wanna make sure
we are able to find a nice house

1411
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,202
and I can sew the drapes
and pick matching bed covers.

1412
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,165
This is how you now want
to be spending this evening?

1413
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,647
This is what you wanna do?
You started it.

1414
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,561
No, you are the one
who will not shut up about it.

1415
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,923
But if you wanna talk about it,
really talk about it,

1416
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,205
I would prefer to have an
unemotional, rational conversation.

1417
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,010
Do you think we could do that?

1418
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,044
Here we go, unemotional, rational.

1419
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,244
You always play the part
of the one and only rational one.

1420
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,961
And I'm the irrational, hysterical,
hormone-crazy one

1421
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,605
because I have emotions.

1422
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,531
You sit back and speak
from your big perspective,

1423
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,166
which means
everything you say is true.

1424
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,890
I don't always do anything.

1425
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,801
The world is fucked by unemotional,
rational men deciding shit.

1426
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,449
Politicians going to war, corporate heads
deciding to wreck the environment.

1427
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,530
Cheney, Rumsfeld, very rational men.

1428
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,563
Cheney and Rumsfeld,
yeah, okay.

1429
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,843
The Final Solution,
very rational thinking behind that.

1430
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,411
Okay. So we're there now?

1431
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,047
Us versus the Final Solution?
Okay. Let's do it. All right.

1432
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,083
Let me ask you this, all right?

1433
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,084
Do you think Henry's life
would be helped

1434
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,760
by a more consistent presence
by you and me? Huh?

1435
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,046
Here we go.
No.

1436
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,131
You won't drop it, so let's talk.
Let me just ask you one question.

1437
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,887
Think Hank's life
would be better served

1438
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,202
by consistent presence
from you and me?

1439
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,250
Yes, it'd be better if he lived with us.
Okay.

1440
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,284
I think his mom
is a fucking alcoholic, hateful cunt

1441
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,007
that used the time we were in Paris
and I was giving birth

1442
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,722
to legally move Henry out of
New York. Fuck her.

1443
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,647
Okay. I agree with you.
Mm-hm.

1444
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,724
Okay. Unfortunately,
we cannot go get him out of America,

1445
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,566
but we could, if we wanted to,
go to him.

1446
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,246
Now, I know it would be
a big move.

1447
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,445
But what do you think? ls there any way
that you could be happy in the U.S.?

1448
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:10,288
Is that just out of the realm of possibility?
That you could find a comparable job?

1449
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,771
Comparable job?
Yeah.

1450
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,331
Are you kidding?
No.

1451
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,444
Why am I the one that have
to make the compromises?

1452
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,007
Don't be so dramatic. Okay?
It should be...

1453
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,931
Moving to Chicago
is pretty fucking dramatic for me.

1454
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,330
I'm not saying we should move.
I just wanna talk about it.

1455
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,251
Can you be my friend
for two seconds so we can talk?

1456
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,680
Two seconds.
All right.

1457
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,844
Remember that time you were late
to pick the girls up

1458
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:38,841
and you were so stressed out because
they were wondering what happened?

1459
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,884
Okay, that is the way
that I feel all the time.

1460
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:46,165
Like I fucked up. I mean, I left him
behind and I just wanna go get him.

1461
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,005
You always get like this
when you drop him off.

1462
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,168
You're sad, so you start a fight.

1463
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,370
He's fine.

1464
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,490
He's a great kid, okay?

1465
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,251
Truth is, he doesn't need you
the way he used to.

1466
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,843
You missed the opportunity to be with him
every day of his childhood. You did.

1467
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,681
And you can cry about it,
but he's growing up.

1468
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,085
You're a great father in other ways.
You got divorced

1469
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:16,165
like millions of other people.
Was it ideal? No. But...

1470
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:20,401
Listen, if in one month
you still want me to quit my job

1471
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,082
and give up everything I've
been working towards, just ask,

1472
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,847
but right now
I feel the same way I always have.

1473
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:32,250
I would move to the U.S. if that ex-wife
of yours would give us joint custody.

1474
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,125
But every other weekend
amounts to shit.

1475
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,964
That's less than
30 days a semester.

1476
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:41,842
I don't think it's worth it for us to change
our entire lives over that kind of time.

1477
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,122
I know. You're right. Mm-hm.
Right? Right?

1478
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,761
See, I'm being the rational one.

1480
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,880
Oh, it's just such a shitty position,
you know?

1481
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,806
Hank didn't do anything, but he's the
one getting kicked in the teeth.

1482
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,441
We all get dragged
through our parents' lives.

1483
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,644
Your marriage would have ended
over something else.

1484
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,451
Absolutely.
Or worse, he would've been raised

1485
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,409
by two miserable parents.
Right.

1486
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,207
I just really fucked that up.

1487
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,962
You mean, you fucked up by moving
to Paris to be with me?

1488
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,250
No. That's not what I meant. Stop.
I knew that was gonna cost too much.

1489
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,767
I told you not to do it, okay?
Stop it.

1490
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:28,486
Okay, I moved to New York with you
for two years and gave up everything.

1491
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,365
I needed to be home
to give birth to the twins

1492
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,530
and I wanted to be with my mother.
You wanted it too.

1493
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,160
Yes.
That's the one thing I asked from you.

1494
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,330
The one thing, and now you're gonna
blame me forever?

1495
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,646
Stop it, will you? Stop it.

1496
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,205
If you don't wanna move back
to the States, we won't. End of story.

1497
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,368
I am just trying to find a way

1498
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,444
where I could be a more consistent
presence in his life.

1499
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:58,405
And ideally, I'd like to do that
as a family.

1500
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,481
"As a family"? Or what?

1501
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,483
What the fuck does that mean?

in everything you say.

1504
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,802
Either do this or I will resent you
for the rest of our lives.

01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,570

You know what? You know what?
I'm sensing something.

1509
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,408
I think the problem is, is that you don't
want me to have a more substantial job.

1510
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,002
On some level, you feel threatened
by my achieving anything

1511
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,044
that could diminish your status
in our relationship.

1512
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,607
My status in our relationship?

1513
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,805
I teach two courses a semester
at the fucking American School.

1514
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,765
Okay. Wow, that's really some status.

1515
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,440
I don't think it's coincidence
you feel that

1516
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,769
at the same time
I have a truly exciting job opportunity.

1517
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,084
This whole train of thought
is complete horseshit and you know it.

1518
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,847
I have a question for you.

1519
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:02,120
If we didn't have the girls and all our
crap, would we even still be together?

1520
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,049
What?

1521
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,369
You are the fucking mayor
of crazy town, do you know that?

1522
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,201
You know what I think? You need
to move to Chicago. Henry needs you.

1523
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,971
I stay in Paris with the girls
and take this job.

1524
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,525
Why are you doing this?
Huh?

1525
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,410
That is a ridiculous idea.

1526
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,884
I'm gonna lose you and the girls? No. Why
do you make everything so difficult?

1527
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,641
You're unhappy. You're blaming me
for taking you away from your son.

1528
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,491
That is a completely irrational
response

1529
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:31,809
to something I'm just trying
to feel my way through.

1530
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,007
Listen, Jesse, we've just
spent the last six weeks here,

1531
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,928
and it's been great.

1532
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:45,082
You've been able to write every day
and the weather's been nice.

1533
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,251
But I didn't wanna come to Greece.
I know.

1534
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,171
All right? There could be
a revolution any second.

1535
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,489
Oh, God.
People eat a lot of feta and olive oil

1536
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,765
and they act all happy, but they
actually talk about how angry they are

1537
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,725
and it confuses me. I don't
know what's gonna happen.

1538
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,042
Oh-oh-oh. Let me
tell you what's gonna happen.

1539
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,323
The same thing
that always happens.

1540
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,562
Nothing.

1541
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:13,282
All right. Know what? I have had
absolutely zero time for myself.

1542
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,649
I have 10,000 e-mails I have to
answer that I didn't answer.

1543
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,966
You think I don't?

1544
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,647
I spend all day making dinner
and wiping you and your son's pee

1545
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,842
while you talk to fellow novelists.

1546
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:29,689
Blah, blah, blah, you're a genius. Oh,
blah, blah, blah, no, you're a genius.

1547
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,803
Mm-hm.
The second we say goodbye to Henry,

1548
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,884
you suggest I give up
my dream job.

1549
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,889
Oh, okay, now it's your dream job?

1550
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,084
This afternoon
you weren't even sure you wanted it.

1551
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,089
Do you ever listen to yourself?

1552
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,643
It is my dream job. Just because I have
doubts doesn't mean I don't want it.

1553
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,251
Okay.
But why do you care?

1554
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,041
You go on your two-hour contemplative
walk under the olive trees.

1555
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,527
Socrates. You should get a robe.

1556
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,330
Uh-huh. It's an hour.

1557
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,047
By the time you leave and by the
time you're with us, two hours.

1558
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,441
I could never do that.

1559
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:05,929
You're good at taking care of yourself. I
take care of myself and everything else.

1560
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,925
We go, you pack your bag.
I pack everything else.

1561
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,482
You would never let me pack
the girls' shit. Never.

1562
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,047
There would be no shoes
and dirty underwear.

1563
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,565
Yeah, right, so says you.

1564
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,486
No, I'm happy you have time
to contemplate the universe

1565
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,246
because I don't.
I barely have time to think.

1566
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,522
I work, I babysit,
I work, I babysit.

1567
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,566
Could you hold on a second? I just
have to tune up the string section.

1568
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:34,408
You know what? Only time I get to think
now is when I take a shit at the office.

1569
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,285
I'm starting to associate thoughts
with the smell of shit.

1570
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,764
Ha, ha. Well, that is a good line.
I'm gonna use that in a book someday.

1571
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,930
Yeah, I'm sure and that'll be
the best line in the book.

1572
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,690
And by the way, you may never,

1573
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,320
ever use me
or anything I say or do

1574
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,127
in one of your fucking books again.
That goes for the girls too.

1575
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,005
A, you shouldn't have
hooked up with a writer.

1576
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,646
B, you weren't in the last book
or the one now.

1577
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,451
C, I'm gonna write about
whatever the fuck I want.

1578
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,444
As always,
our life works for you.

1579
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:07,048
No, no, no. Don't give me this
put-upon housewife bullshit. Okay?

1580
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,366
This is not the '50s.

1581
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,525
Sorry to ruin your perfect little
narrative of oppression with the truth,

1582
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,929
but I am the one who's at home
dealing with the bullshit.

1583
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,242
You're at work until 6:30.
Six o'clock.

1584
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,411
You take the girls to school, I pick them up.
That's fair. That's our deal.

1585
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:28,482
We live in Paris, France, for chrissakes.
And you remind me of it every day.

1586
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,401
I have orbited my entire life
around you and you know it. Okay?

1587
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,649
Sorry if this summer's vacation...
And it is a vacation.

1588
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,487
I've seen you frolic in the sea
and shove salad down your throat.

1589
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,850
But it is not indicative of you spending
your life in domestic servitude.

1590
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,442
You know what I love about men?
They still believe in magic.

1591
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,126
Little fairies around
who pick up their socks,

1592
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,484
little fairies unload the dishwasher,
little fairies sunscreen the kids.

1593
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,082
Little fairies who make the Greek
salad that you eat like a pig.

1594
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,890
Okay, listen to me. All right?

1595
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,004
You are great at taking care of us.
You are.

1596
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,801
I mean, you take care of the kids,
you take care of your friends,

1597
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,925
you take care of the world. You were
like that before you were a mom

1598
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,810
and now it's only magnified.

1599
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:16,010
But, and I've been telling you this
for years now,

1600
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,409
you gotta do a little better job
taking care of yourself.

1601
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,046
Okay, stop patronizing me.
All right?

1602
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:26,006
I'm the one at home every day at 6,
not 6:30. I'm reliable.

1603
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:30,524
Have you ever booked a babysitter,
ever, in your entire life? No.

1604
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:34,884
What is the name of their pediatrician?
Stop quizzing me. It's fucking boring.

1605
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,011
Yeah, okay. You know what? I'm at
home every night and I make dinner,

1606
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,283
give baths and read stories.
Sometimes you're there,

1607
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,565
sometimes you're at a university event
or a publicity tour. Okay?

1608
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,923
When you get inspired,
you keep on writing.

1609
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,970
I get inspired too sometimes,
you know that?

1610
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,964
You wanna write? Write.
No, but you remember

1611
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,731
I used to sing and play guitar
and write songs?

1612
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,328
I'd still like to do it,
but I don't get to. There isn't time.

1613
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,445
Okay. Well, first off,
my writing isn't a hobby. All right?

1614
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,047
Secondly,
I wish you would find the time.

1615
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,369
You somehow find time to complain
about eight hours a day.

1616
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,889
I mean,
I love the way you sing. Okay?

1617
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,843
I fucked up my whole life
because of the way you sing. All right?

1618
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:25,931
If you took one-eighth
of the energy that you spend

1619
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,600
on bitching, whining and worrying...

1620
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,488
If you put that energy into playing scales,
you'd be like fucking Django Reinhardt.

1621
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,851
Okay. All right.

1622
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,247
You forgot your shoes.

1623
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,089
Oh, God.

1624
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,731
Hey.

1625
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,166
<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>

1626
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,765
You think you're winning?

1627
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,846
Few people realize

1628
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,170
what it's like for an active or
passionate woman to have a child.

1629
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,369
Friends told me, "You'll wanna
throw them out the window."

1630
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:20,282
But I never wanted to hurt them once, but
I thought about ending it for myself.

1631
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,482
I was so confused and you were
always away on a stupid book tour

1632
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,326
or because of Henry's custody shit,
and I didn't wanna be a burden.

1633
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,086
I know why Sylvia Plath
put her head in a toaster.

1634
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,726
It was an oven.
Don't play with words.

1635
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,810
You know what I mean.
Toaster, oven, same thing.

1636
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,561
You know how many times I was alone
crying with no clue what to do?

1637
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,008
Know the guilt a mother feels
when she doesn't know what to do?

1638
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,369
Do you think you have
sole ownership of that feeling?

1639
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,966
I don't think you understand.
Okay?

1640
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,204
You know what my secret fear is?
With every man?

1641
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:57,405
Is that they all wanna turn me
into a submissive housewife.

1642
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,769
Okay. No one could ever do that.
All right?

1643
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,609
I promise. It would be easier
to fit your head into a toaster

1644
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,525
than to turn you
into anything submissive.

1645
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,730
I don't think I've recovered
since giving birth.

1646
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,651
When they were born,
I had no idea what to do.

1647
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,731
People expect women
to have this instinct that kicks in

1648
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,649
like a female baboon.

1649
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,844
But I had no idea how to do anything.

1650
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,761
I loved them so much
and I was doing everything wrong.

1651
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,568
And you were away so often, calling
me and asking me how my day went,

1652
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,481
and I couldn't even say it to you
because I felt so ashamed

1653
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,806
to be so clueless.

1654
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,008
I think you did great.
No, I didn't.

1655
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,647
No, you did. Well, you did
a good job faking it, then.

1656
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,529
I just... I remember the only way
I could get them to sleep

1657
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:51,281
was to drag that stupid
double stroller down the stairs

1658
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,131
and walk them for hours
in the middle of the night,

1659
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,881
all the way to Pigalle and back.
I almost got mugged once.

1660
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:02,483
The only reason why the guy didn't
attack me is that I looked so pathetic.

1661
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,287
The only upside of being over 35 is
that you don't get raped as much.

1662
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,802
Ha-ha-ha.
I read it. It's true.

1663
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,401
Oh, Jesus.

1664
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,527
Once, I remember, I was watching the
twins on a trampoline, you know,

1665
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,643
and they looked so beautiful,

1666
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,207
and I was happy
because they were happy.

1667
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,563
You know,
one of them had this Hula-Hoop

1668
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,570
that she was using as a jump rope,
you know,

1669
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,010
but then the other one wanted it so they
started fighting over it, you know?

1670
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,248
And all of a sudden,
I just saw it all.

1671
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:40,729
You know, all this petty jealously
and selfishness, you know?

1672
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:47,485
And I remember thinking, "Okay, this,
heh, is the natural human state."

1673
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:53,210
You know, just always a little dissatisfied,
perpetually discontented, you know?

1674
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,244
I mean, heh, look at us.

1675
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,570
Here we are, we are in, you know,
the Garden of Eden

1676
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,286
and we can't stop fighting.

1677
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,366
I don't think there's
one natural human state.

1678
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,085
The human state is multiple.

1679
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,568
If that's what you see when
you're watching the girls play,

1680
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,962
that means you're depressed.

1681
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,207
Okay. Maybe I am.

1682
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:21,530
No, but when I see them fight, I see
beautiful energy of going forward,

1683
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:25,002
not letting anyone step on them
or take away what they want.

1684
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,090
I like it when they fight.
It gives me hope for them.

1685
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,442
You see anger
as a positive emotion.

1686
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:35,328
You know, you only end up hurting
yourself, your work, the kids, me.

1687
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,805
And you never get angry?

1688
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,970
When I do,
I don't see it as a positive.

1689
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,969
You know something?

1690
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,167
<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>

1691
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,891
The way you write, people
come up to me and think

1692
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,608
I make love to some wildcat
Henry Miller type. Ha!

1693
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:01,049
You like to have sex
the exact same way every time.

1694
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,043
Mm. When you got it, you got it.

1695
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,130
Kissy, kissy. Tittie, tittie.
Pussy.

1696
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,327
<font color="#D900D9">(SNORES)</font>

1697
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,841
I'm a man of simple pleasures.

1698
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,646
Yeah, very simple,

1699
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,411
and I've been meaning
to tell you that lately. Tsk.

1700
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,650
You're no Henry Miller,
on any level.

1701
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:24,330
And you know what? Heh.
This room gives me the creeps.

1702
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,729
I was expecting something quaint,
like the real Greece.

1703
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:30,042
Place is real.
What are we doing here?

1704
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,881
This is too planned, like we're
supposed to have this great evening.

1705
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,084
No room for spontaneity.
It is all gone from our lives.

1706
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,090
This is stupid and it's not working.
Obviously.

1707
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:43,648
And I curse Ariadni and that perv
Stefanos for doing this.

1708
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,330
Okay. A couple's massage?

1709
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,040
What the fuck is that?
That sounds sleazy to me.

1710
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,971
We don't have to do it!
Okay?

1711
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,401
Come on,
this place isn't so bad.

1712
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,329
I like hotel rooms.

1713
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,124
I think they're sexy.

1714
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,442
Yeah, I know you do...

1715
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,682
Mr. Book-Tour.

1716
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,011
Mr. Radisson-Hilton.

1717
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:12,205
And I know that time when you were
doing that reading in Washington,

1718
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,883
when your cell phone supposedly
broke that night. How convenient.

1719
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,526
Swear on our kids you didn't fuck
that lady from the bookstore. Emily.

1720
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,970
Swear to me
you didn't fuck that Emily girl.

1721
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:27,527
And I'm not jealous
because I'm not the type.

1722
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,883
But I just wanna know. Okay?
Be a man and admit the truth.

1723
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,883
I am giving you my whole life,
okay?

1724
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,651
I got nothing larger to give.

1725
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,763
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

1726
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,648
If you're looking for permission
to disqualify me,

1727
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,683
I'm not gonna give it to you.

1728
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:51,327
Okay? I love you,

1729
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,601
and I am not in conflict
about it. Okay?

1730
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,002
But if what you want
is a laundry list

1731
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,522
of things about you that
piss me off, I could give it to you.

1732
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,161
Yeah. I want to hear.
Okay. Well, uh,

1733
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,848
let's start at number one, okay?
Number one, you're fucking nuts.

1734
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,611
All right? You are.
Good luck finding somebody

1735
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,247
to put up with your shit for
more than, like, six months. Okay?

1736
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:19,849
But I accept the whole package,
the crazy and the brilliant, all right?

1737
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,250
You're not gonna change, I don't want you to.
It's accepting you for being you.

1738
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:29,480
I asked a question. If, while I was carrying
that double stroller down the stairs

1739
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:33,765
and getting ass-raped in Pigalle, you
fucked that little Emily Brontë girl?

1740
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,731
I don't know what Emily.
What are you talking about?

1741
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,486
The one that wrote the e-mails
about Dostoevsky?

1742
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,842
"Oh, Jesse, you're so right."

1743
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,364
"The Grand Commander is the deepest
passage of all of Russian literature."

1744
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,369
If you're asking me

1745
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:52,730
if I'm committed to you, the girls
and the life we built together,

1746
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,447
the answer is a resounding yes.

1747
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,883
So you did fuck her.
Thank you very much.

1748
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:04,961
Do I ask about the time you went to your
old boyfriend after his mother died? No.

1749
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:08,647
Why? Because I know the way that
your fucking French ass works

1750
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:13,164
and I guarantee that you at least blew
that guy, but I also know you love me.

1751
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,648
All right? I'm okay with you
being a complicated human being.

1752
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:20,805
I don't wanna live a boring life
where two people own each other,

1753
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,891
where two people are institutionalized
in a box that others created

1754
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,127
because that is a bunch

1755
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:29,090
of stifling bullshit!

1756
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,966

I love you anymore.

I don't wanna talk right now.

or waiting for somebody?

1764
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:14,730
I'm by myself and happy to be.

1765

kids, my work and everyone I love.

Well, just my type-

1767
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,844
Okay. I'm not in the mood.
I came here to be alone.

1768

I've just been checking you out, and I
don't wanna make you uncomfortable,

1769
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,768
but you are, by far, the
best-looking woman in this place.

1770
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,327
Thank you.
I'd love to buy you a drink,

1771
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,000
maybe talk to you,
get to know you a bit.

1772
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,611
Are you here on business?

1773
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,804
Okay. I see.
You have a boyfriend?

1774
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,240
Not anymore.

1775
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,649
Jeez, sorry to hear that.
God, you wanna talk about it?

1776
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,605
I don't talk to strangers.

1777
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,603
That's the thing,
I'm not a stranger.

1778
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,649
No, no, no, we've met before.
Oh.

1779
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,682
Summer '94.

1780
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,086
You're mistaking me for someone else.
No.

1781
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,001
We even fell in love.
Really?

1782
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,924
Mm-hm.

1783
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:09,846
Hm. I vaguely remember
someone sweet and romantic

1784
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:14,250
who made me feel like I wasn't alone.
Someone who had respect for who I was.

1785
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,210
That's me. I'm that guy.

1786
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,650
I don't think so.
Oh.

1787
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,003
See, I know something about
tonight that you don't know.

1788
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,000
Really? What is that?

1789
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,801
Something important.

1790
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:33,206
You see, I know because I've actually
already lived through this night.

1791
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,846
How?
I'm a time traveler.

1792
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,726
Okay.

1793
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:43,642
No, I have a time machine in my room. I've
come to save you, like I said I would.

1794
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,686
Save me from what?
From being blinded by the bullshit of life.

1795
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,126
It's not bullshit.

I assure you,
that guy you vaguely remember,

that you met on a train?

Yeah.

1800
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,210

And next thing I know, I'm in Chicago.

1809

by some pick-up line.

No, you misunderstand me.

01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,930
No, no, no.
I'm only here as a messenger.

1812
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,408
I've just traveled all the way
from the future.

1813
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,850
I was just with
your 82-year-old self

1814
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:45,567
who gave me a letter
to read to you.

1815
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,125
So here I am.

1816
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:49,483
I'm still alive in my 80's?

1817
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:52,490
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hm.

1818
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,881
How's my French ass?
Nice.

1819
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,048
Okay.
Really nice.

1820
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:00,921
I don't care about the way I look.
There's more of you to love.

1821
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,162
Great.
You want me to read it to you?

1822
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,204
Do I have a choice?
Sure. If you're not interested...

1823
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,646
No, no, no.

1824
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,162
Read it.
Okay. All right. Well, here it is.

1825
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:16,446
"Dear Celine, I am writing to you
from the other side of the woods."

1826
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:20,122
"This letter is lighting a candle that will..."
Okay, stop it.

1827
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:23,847
I would never write this.
"Other side of the woods." What woods?

1828
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,202
May I please continue?
Okay.

1829
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,324
"I am sending you this young man."

1830
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,971
"Yes, young."

1831
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:34,369
"And he will be your escort."

1832
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,724
"God knows he has many problems
and has struggled his whole life

1833
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:44,290
connecting and being present,
even with those he loves the most."

1834
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,484
"And for that he is deeply sorry."

1835

"You're entering the best years
of your life."

1838
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:02,210
"Looking back from where I sit now,

"Your girls will grow up to become
examples and icons of feminism."

Nice one.
Yeah.

at the bottom. Looks important.

1848

Maybe I should skip over
some of this.

Yeah, skip away. Please.
Okay.

You sure? Yeah, okay, yeah.

1851
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,964
All right.
Boring stuff.

1852
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:42,802
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's like,
blah, blah, blah, financial tips,

happened one night

to a new, ground-breaking level."

stop this stupid game?

We're not in one of
your stories. Okay?

1862

back in the room? Did you hear me?

Yes, I heard you.

1864

What, that
you don't love me anymore?

1865
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:33,326
I figured you didn't mean it,
but if you did, then, uh...

1866

Oh, fuck it. Know something? You're just
like the little girls and everybody else.

make things better.

I tell you I love you,
I tell you you're beautiful,

1870

Okay.

1873
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,209
All right, I put up
with plenty of your shit.

And if you think I'm just some dog who's
gonna keep coming back, you're wrong.

1875
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:05,851
But if you want true love,
then this is it.

It's not perfect, but it's real.

01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,088
How does it work?

1884
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,007
Well, it's complicated.

1885
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:11,963
Am I gonna have to
get naked to operate it?

1886
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,811
I mean...

1887
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:19,647
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's actually...
It's been a real issue, you know?

1888
01:43:19,880 --> 01:43:24,408
I mean, I... Clothes, they don't travel well
through the whole space-time continuum.

1889
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,125
It's...

Wow. You're so smart.

1891
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,128
Ha, ha. Oh, jeez.

1892
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,529
Space-time...?
Continuum.

1893
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:39,841
Continuum.
Yeah. Really.

1894
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,961
There's something that I've been
thinking about, about your letter.

1895
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:46,242
Yeah?
You know, you, uh...

1896
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:49,205
You mentioned the southern
Peloponnese?

1897
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,643
Yeah, yeah, and we're
in the southern Peloponnese.

1898
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:53,926
Mm-hm.

1899
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,566
Yeah, and do you think
it could be tonight

1900
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:59,969
that you're still talking about
in your 80's?

1901
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,810
<font color="#D900D9">(IN NORMAL VOICE)</font> Well...

1902
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,647
it must have been one hell
of a night we're about to have.
