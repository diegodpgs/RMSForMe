1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,720
"Not for pleasure alone"

2
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,880
Fanny.

3
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,850
Mother.

4
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,320
Siri.

5
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,240
Maj.

6
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,910
Grandma.

7
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,930
I am king of 17 lands.

8
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,020
Heed my command.

9
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,200
Alexander.

10
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,700
How are things?

11
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,640
Would you like to play cards before dinner?

12
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,030
THE FIRST ACT

13
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,170
THE EKDAHL FAMILY CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS

14
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,710
It takes longer every year.

15
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,920
Worthy Joseph,
do not fear

16
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,580
Thy angel is thee ever near.

17
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,920
I come in haste to bring thee word

18
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,220
from thy creator and thy God.

19
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,340
Mary and the child now wake

20
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,470
and quickly into safety take.

21
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,930
Herod with his murdering hand

22
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,600
threatens every man-child in this land.

23
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,120
All this I have noted well

24
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,790
and shall do as you foretell.

25
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,120
Praised be God upon his throne

26
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,920
who thus protects my only son.

27
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,980
Thus, good people,
ends our play.

28
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,310
It all ends well this holy day.

29
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,060
The son of God,
saved from the sword

30
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,070
is our saviour,
Christ the lord.

31
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,440
We know that in his mercy mild

32
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:30,830
he guards every woman,
man and child.

33
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,330
Though far from Bethlehem we roam

34
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,500
the star in the east leads us home.

35
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,590
Merrily may every light

36
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,590
shed its radiance clear and bright.

37
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,810
A time of joyous Christmas cheer

38
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,100
we wish to all,
both far and near.

39
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,270
Let no one into darkness fall.

40
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,240
A merry Christmas one and all.

41
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:51,410
Traditionally the Ekdahls give a party
for the theatre staff down on the stage.

42
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,420
The guests are what you'd
call a rather mixed lot.

43
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,960
Quite different from what we're used
to here in the theatre restaurant.

44
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,340
Nevertheless, I don't want to
see any supercilious glances,

45
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,380
snootiness, or raised eyebrows.

46
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,180
I want to see generosity,
warmth and kindness. Is that clear?

47
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,930
- Yes, sir.
- That's the spirit!

48
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,800
Alma and Petra,
take the Christmas basket.

49
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,430
I'll take the punch bowl.

50
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,110
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir.

51
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,610
Forward march!

52
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,080
Come along, Carlchen.

53
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,500
We mustn't be late to your
mother's like last year.

54
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,000
Come along.

55
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,000
Hurry up.

56
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,210
Merry Christmas!

57
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,380
Merry Christmas, Oscar.

58
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,720
Help yourselves, everybody!

59
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,730
Step forward,
step forward. Don't be shy.

60
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,530
When you've given Ismael his dinner,

61
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,780
turn off the lights in the shop and lock up.

62
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,950
I have the key.

63
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,090
Good night, Aron.

64
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,250
Good night, uncle Isak.

65
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,530
This is the 43rd Christmas
we're celebrating together.

66
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,530
My dear ester,
is it possible?

67
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,370
Yes, the 43rd.

68
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,660
Well, well,
who'd have thought it?

69
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,210
Yes, it's odd.

70
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,170
Dear ester.

71
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,700
Good evening, Mrs. Ekdahl.

72
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,530
Good evening, girls.

73
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,390
- Alida, you may join the other girls.
- Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.

74
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,350
- Why are you so sullen?
- I'm not sullen.

75
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,980
I can see you are.

76
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,940
You're always sullen on Christmas eve.

77
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,740
- I don't know what you mean.
- You heard me. You're sullen.

78
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,410
Old hag.

79
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,600
My dear friends.

80
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,140
For 22 years...

81
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,520
in the capacity of theatre manager,

82
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,060
I've stood here and made a speech...

83
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,120
without really having any talent...

84
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,040
for that sort of thing.

85
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,590
Especially if you think of my father,

86
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,930
who was brilliant at speeches.

87
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,230
My only talent,
if you can call it that in my case...

88
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,180
is that I love this little world...

89
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,900
inside the thick walls of this playhouse.

90
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,790
And I'm fond of the people
who work in this little world.

91
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,710
Outside is the big world,

92
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,500
and sometimes the little world succeeds...

93
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,510
in reflecting the big one...

94
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,390
so that we understand it better.

95
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,100
Or perhaps we give the people who come here

96
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:05,070
a chance to forget for a while...

97
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,870
for a few short moments...

98
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,290
for a few short moments...

99
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,800
the harsh world outside.

100
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,510
Our theatre is...

101
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,180
a little room...

102
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,280
of orderliness, routine, care...

103
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,900
and love.

104
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,250
I don't know why I feel...

105
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:02,470
so comically solemn...
this evening.

106
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,640
I can't explain how I feel,
so I'd best be brief.

107
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,180
My wife and I...

108
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,470
and the rest of the Ekdahl family,

109
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,940
my brother Carl
- I think Carl is here.

110
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,240
We wish you all a happy and joyous Christmas.

111
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,610
I hope we meet again on St. Stephen's day,
strengthened in body and soul.

112
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,080
Merry Christmas.

113
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,190
Isak!

114
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,030
Merry Christmas.

115
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,420
I can't think where they all are.

116
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,140
They should have been here a long time ago.

117
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,350
I expect Oscar is making a long,
dull speech.

118
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,220
I think I hear them down in the street.

119
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,690
Ester, bring me my fur.

120
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,790
There comes my family.

121
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,900
Merry Christmas.

122
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,980
Merry Christmas, grandma.

123
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,780
Merry Christmas, aunt.

124
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,870
Mama, you look so beautiful.

125
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,920
What is it, darling?

126
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,800
Aunt Emma,
how nice to see you.

127
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,930
Aunt Emma,
how nice. Welcome.

128
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,360
What time is it?

129
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,570
The only question is:
Where are Carl and Lydia?

130
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,790
Perhaps they got the wrong time.

131
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,830
Christmas dinner is always at 4:30.

132
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:16,300
Alexander, run down and
ring uncle Carl's doorbell.

133
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,180
- Carlchen, please hurry.
- Shut up!

134
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,770
- We're so late.
- Shut up!

135
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,020
We arrive late every year.

136
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,940
- I'm doing this for your sake.
- No more, mein Carlchen.

137
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,820
- Mama.
- Well, Carl.

138
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,030
Merry Christmas, aunt.

139
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,580
Well, at last we can have dinner.

140
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,810
Now for the first sing hop faderallan lallan lay

141
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,690
and those who don't the first one
take will also number two forsake

142
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,190
now for the first

143
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,000
sing hop faderallan lallan lay

144
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,130
cheers, Isak and miss Alida.

145
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,480
I've got terrible heartburn.
I have to take a pill.

146
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,240
Mr. Jacobi, how awful!

147
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,230
The Ekdahls will be the death of me.

148
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:06,110
After last Christmas,
I was in bed for three weeks with kidney pains.

149
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,830
- You don't say.
- Worse than childbirth.

150
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,670
Does miss Alida have children?

151
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,040
Good heavens, no.
Why do you ask?

152
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,640
I'm in need of a housekeeper,
miss Alida.

153
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Thank you, sir,
but I like it with the Ekdahl family.

154
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,940
Let's discuss it after the new year.

155
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,850
Well, there's no harm in discussing it.

156
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:46,450
So you see,
my brother Gustav Adolf Ekdahl

157
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,540
is a magnificent human being.

158
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:56,200
Then you brown the breasts,
but use plenty of butter in the pan,

159
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,880
and fry some prime pork at the same time.

160
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,720
Then you put the ground
meat on top of the breast,

161
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,590
and the pork on top of that.

162
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,890
Finally, you pour the port sauce with
mushrooms on top of everything.

163
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,860
Hey, Christmas gnomes let's
raise our glasses and be merry

164
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,740
our time on earth is brief full of toil and grief

165
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,570
hey, Christmas gnomes let's
raise our glasses and be merry

166
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,790
no appetite, miss ester?

167
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,210
Miss Vega,
you're not eating anything yourself.

168
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,260
It's not easy, I must say.

169
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,550
No, it's not easy.
You're right.

170
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,770
It's unseemly,
all of us sitting together like this.

171
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,430
I agree with you.
It's unseemly.

172
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,980
Sitting together in the kitchen.

173
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,110
It was the old master who decided --

174
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,980
Be that as it may.
It's awkward nonetheless.

175
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,450
Yes, it is. It's awkward.

176
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,950
Well, Fanny,
we're having a pleasant time, aren't we?

177
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,750
I think dinner is taking too long.

178
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,840
You're wondering what you'll get for Christmas,
of course.

179
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,830
Aren't you,
uncle Gusten?

180
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,090
You're absolutely right,
my dear.

181
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,140
I'm quite curious as to
what the evening will bring.

182
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,140
Frau von Bahlen.

183
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,730
My dear husband has implored
me to sing something after dinner.

184
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,780
I said I couldn't,
but he's so persistent.

185
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,990
He says my singing reminds him

186
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,500
of our youthful days in Munich.

187
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,160
My husband is so touching,
Frau von Bahlen.

188
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,800
Sometimes he's like a child.

189
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:09,590
Your father is a magnificent human being.

190
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,510
You think I'm being sarcastic.

191
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,850
I'm never sarcastic when I'm in good spirits.

192
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,230
So believe me, Petra,
when I say...

193
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,360
then you add carrots, sprouts,
red cabbage and cauliflower,

194
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,990
and then you pour cognac
over the whole thing.

195
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,870
We'll have to try it on twelfth night
- if we're still alive, of course.

196
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:02,020
Dear friends,
I would like to make a speech.

197
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,650
But I'm not going to.

198
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,370
Cheers, Carl.
Short and sweet!

199
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,490
This is the 24th Christmas I've
celebrated with the family.

200
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,740
My dear Emma,
is it really possible?

201
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,630
Yes, my Karl-Henrik died in '79.

202
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,950
Was it that long ago?

203
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,880
He'd be 98 years old if he were living today.

204
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,050
My dear Emma,
imagine that.

205
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,510
I was 19 when we got married.

206
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,230
You were only 19?

207
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,150
A great age difference.

208
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,690
There's no denying that.
But you were fond of --

209
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,560
My sister also married an older man.

210
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,280
Yes, I remember.
It was a magnificent wedding.

211
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,910
He died three months later,
leaving a fortune behind.

212
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,950
Karl-Henrik did no such thing.

213
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,830
No, he certainly didn't.

214
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,500
Putte!

215
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,460
Try sitting up properly for once.

216
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:17,930
Elbows down and back straight.
You really have awful table manners.

217
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,140
Berta, since you're sitting next to my father,

218
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,400
could you ask him for me if I may be spared

219
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,810
being taught manners on Christmas eve?

220
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,860
- Siri.
- What is it, Jenny?

221
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,070
Are you mad about something?

222
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,900
Not at all.
Why do you ask?

223
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,160
You're not laughing like everybody else.

224
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,960
Some people find it hard to laugh.

225
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,500
Why?

226
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:54,210
Some people bear a great sorrow,
for instance.

227
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,600
And it grows larger and larger
when others are happy?

228
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,180
For some people,
Christmas is a bit difficult.

229
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,640
Why?

230
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,680
Well, Jenny,
there are so many memories.

231
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,400
Maybe you'll be happy by next Christmas.

232
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,360
Maybe.

233
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,690
Aunt Anna?

234
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,530
Yes, Alexander?

235
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,700
Since you're so rich,
you could get any man you please.

236
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,530
- You think so, Alexander?
- That's what father says, anyway.

237
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,370
That's nice to hear.

238
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,050
So, you're leaving us to get married,
miss Berta.

239
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,550
Yes, sir, I am.

240
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,050
Well, it's going to be
damned lonely without you.

241
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,840
Both my wife and I --

242
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,380
It looks like you'll have some consolation.

243
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,480
Here's to old times,
miss Berta.

244
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,600
Cheers, sir...

245
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,360
and good luck.

246
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,370
A rhyme for the porridge.

247
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,500
"Our porridge is our strength and stay

248
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,670
it is our staple food

249
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,420
in joy, in grief,
both night and day

250
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,970
it always does us good"

251
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,700
look! I found the almond!

252
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,440
Four cheers for the coming
year's little bride-to-be!

253
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,290
Now it's Yule again, now it's Yule
again and Yule will last until it's Easter

254
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,630
that's not true of course no,
that's not true of course

255
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,670
for in between comes lent and fasting

256
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,180
what would Maj say to a little
visit in her room this evening?

257
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,560
The master must be joking.

258
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,980
Are you all right, sir?

259
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,040
I'm fine.

260
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,180
I must help the girls with the tree.

261
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,570
Have you noticed that my old
man has begun to court Maj?

262
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,420
- Aren't you angry?
- Angry?

263
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,460
I think it's sweet.

264
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,350
Children, come.

265
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:27,280
Uncle Carl is going to treat you
to one helluva fireworks show.

266
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,110
Stay here.

267
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,090
Ready?

268
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,820
Number one.

269
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,280
Now comes number two.

270
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:08,550
Now comes number three.

271
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,380
Bring the candle.

272
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,530
"And it came to pass in those days

273
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,980
that there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus

274
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,700
that all the world should be taxed.

275
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,990
And this taxing was first made

276
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,080
when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.

277
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:49,380
And all went to be taxed,
every one into his own city.

278
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,760
And Joseph also went up from Galilee

279
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,760
out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judea...

280
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,480
unto the city of David,
which is called Bethlehem...

281
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,900
because he was of the
house and lineage of David,

282
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,070
to be taxed with Mary his wife,

283
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,110
who was great with child.

284
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,330
And so it was that while they were there,

285
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,950
the days were accomplished
that she should be delivered.

286
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,500
And she brought forth her firstborn son
and wrapped him in swaddling clothes

287
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,680
and laid him in a manger,

288
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,300
because there was no
room for them in the inn."

289
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,210
- Give up?
- No!

290
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,400
I'm sorry.
It's a terrible mess in here.

291
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,000
Come see us later and you'll
get a Christmas present.

292
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,250
Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.

293
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,040
Now then, children,
into bed.

294
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,010
Hurry up, Alexander.

295
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,220
To bed now, children.

296
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,290
Now say your prayers.

297
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:37,790
Thank you God for this day.
Please make me good.

298
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,890
May your angel stay by me through the night.

299
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,720
God bless papa and mama,
grandpapa and grandmama,

300
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:46,430
myself and my brothers and sisters
and cousins, uncles and aunts,

301
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,800
Vega, Ester, Maj, Siri, Berta, Alida,

302
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,020
Lisen and uncle Isak and everybody else.

303
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,230
Amen.

304
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,320
- Good night, Alexander.
- Good night, sweetheart.

305
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,610
Good night. Sleep well.

306
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,920
Putte kisses like a real man.

307
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,840
Look at my Christmas present.

308
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,170
Look what Mrs. Ekdahl gave me.

309
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,050
Aren't I beautiful?
Don't I look lovely?

310
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,260
I look like a real lady.

311
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,890
Don't you think?

312
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,810
Tonight you can't sleep in Maj's bed
because Maj will have a visitor.

313
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,950
And I can't just have any
number of men in my bed.

314
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,830
But you're Maj's sweetheart.
You know that.

315
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,400
I think mama should recite something.

316
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,060
No, my dear.

317
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,570
Calm down, now.

318
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,030
Don't be shy.
You give wonderful recitations.

319
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,320
No, I don't know.
I'll have to fortify myself.

320
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,330
I don't know what to read.

321
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,210
Well, you asked for it.

322
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,720
Alone I advance on my course

323
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,020
farther and farther stretches the road

324
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,440
alas, in the distance my goal is hidden

325
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,400
dusk is falling,
night fills the sky

326
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:39,500
soon the everlasting stars are all I see

327
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,040
but I do not lament the fleeting day

328
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,710
the coming night does not appal me

329
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,880
for of the love that shines through the world

330
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,890
a gleam has entered my soul

331
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,730
how beautiful.

332
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,370
Well, my dear ones,
it's time to say good night.

333
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,080
We're getting up early.

334
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,130
Carlchen! Wake up.

335
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:01,930
We're going home.

336
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,100
Good night, mama. Carl's a bit tired.
I'll give him a hand.

337
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,640
Come along now.
We're going home.

338
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,110
Good night.

339
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,990
Good night, mama.

340
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,460
- I stayed behind.
- So I noticed.

341
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,320
There she lies,
the beautiful girl, poor Arabella.

342
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:40,190
Little does she know what awaits her.

343
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,410
She's alone in the whole house.

344
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,540
Her mother is dead, and her father
is carousing with loose companions.

345
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:59,000
Who comes there as the clock
strikes 12:00 in the castle tower?

346
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,710
"Fear seizes me.

347
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,210
What is that terrifying white figure

348
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:12,140
floating on the moonbeams
and drawing near my bed?

349
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,350
It is my dead mother.
My mother's ghost."

350
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,950
No more noise in here now!

351
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,910
Go to sleep, children.
Good night.

352
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,750
I thought I smelled kerosene in the nursery.

353
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,590
- Kerosene?
- Yes, kerosene.

354
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,090
There's no kerosene lamp in the nursery.

355
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,260
Well, it smells like it anyway.

356
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,470
I'll go see what it could be.

357
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,280
It really does smell of kerosene.

358
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,110
Are you sleeping,
you brats?

359
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,580
What have you been up to?

360
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,970
That's strange.

361
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,650
Yes, very strange.

362
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,160
This is a chair.

363
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,990
But not just any chair.

364
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,120
It might look like an ordinary nursery chair,

365
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:07,250
made of wood,
humble and rather worn...

366
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:12,550
but looks can be deceiving.

367
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,260
It's actually the most
valuable chair in the world.

368
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,060
It belonged to the emperor of china

369
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:26,360
and has by strange paths
ended up in the Ekdahl nursery.

370
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,530
But pay attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

371
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,860
Look closely.

372
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,200
Keep your eyes open.

373
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,240
Look there.

374
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,910
Do you see the mysterious light

375
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,880
that radiates from that little chair?

376
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,340
That's right.
It glows from within.

377
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,880
Look how it shines.

378
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,970
Now I ask you,
my children:

379
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:00,060
Why does the chair shine?

380
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,810
Why does it shimmer in the dark?

381
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,070
I'll tell you,
but remember:

382
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:10,190
It's a secret.

383
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,070
Whoever reveals it will perish.

384
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,120
Do you swear to keep quiet?
- We swear.

385
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,120
Not so loud.
Mother could hear us.

386
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,340
And that would be the end of the performance.

387
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,810
This is the most valuable chair in the world.

388
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:50,060
It's made of a metal found
40 miles beneath the earth,

389
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,900
and only in china.

390
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,650
Though it appears encrusted with diamonds,

391
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:01,240
it's much finer and more costly.

392
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:06,040
The chair was built 3,000 years ago

393
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,630
by the emperor's master jeweller

394
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,970
as a birthday present for the empress.

395
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:17,590
She was very small in stature,
not much bigger than Fanny,

396
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,510
but she was the world's most beautiful woman.

397
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,980
Her entire life she sat on this chair.

398
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,060
Two servants accompanied
her wherever she went,

399
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,650
carrying the chair between them.

400
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:37,320
When the empress died,
she was buried sitting on this chair.

401
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:45,280
For 2,000 years she sat in her burial chamber.

402
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:51,210
The chair shimmered in the dark,
its light shining right through

403
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:54,170
the empress's little figure.

404
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,010
But then a band of robbers came

405
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,680
and broke into the tomb.

406
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:04,010
They knocked the empress off the chair,

407
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:06,680
and she turned to powder and dust.

408
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,390
Then they made off with the chair.

409
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,690
Now it belongs to you.

410
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:22,950
The most precious chair in
the world belongs to you.

411
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,780
Take care of it,
for it's very fragile.

412
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,200
It might easily fall to pieces.

413
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:33,660
Touch it gently.

414
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,340
Sit on it very carefully.

415
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,060
Talk to it.

416
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:48,310
And at least twice a day breathe on it.

417
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,260
What an idiotic little chair!

418
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,520
So worn and ridiculous!

419
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:35,440
And ugly, to boot!

420
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:41,440
I'll be damned!

421
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:46,030
I think the confounded chair
is trying to bite my rear end!

422
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,450
I'll show it!

423
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,320
Don't do that!

424
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,650
Have you all gone mad?
It's 3:00 in the morning!

425
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,150
We have to get up for church in two hours!

426
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,990
- Can we be in Hamlet?
- Please.

427
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,200
I know you've spoken with Mr. Landahl,
but this is a matter for father to decide.

428
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:30,660
It's for mother to decide.

429
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,500
It's much too late for children
who have school the next day.

430
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,620
No, it's not.

431
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,170
We can be pages in the first act.

432
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,170
Who's not in the last act can't be in the first.

433
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,890
It has to be different pages
in the last act anyway.

434
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,600
Good night, kids.

435
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:50,560
On the condition that you do your homework...

436
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,770
and come straight home
after the court scenes.

437
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:01,650
And absolutely no whining about
getting up the next morning.

438
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:14,620
Here we go, Isak.
I've made some nice strong coffee.

439
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,750
Much better than Vega's awful dishwater.

440
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,540
Give this a try.

441
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:25,090
What can the time be?
Ten past 3:00.

442
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,510
We can sit for two hours,

443
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,270
and then I must change for early service.

444
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,230
How good it is to have you here!

445
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,230
You're my best friend.

446
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,600
Whatever would I do without you?

447
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,910
Last year I enjoyed Christmas.

448
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,080
This year all I wanted to do was cry.

449
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:05,710
I suppose I'm getting old.

450
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,930
Do you think I've aged?

451
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,720
You've grown older, yes.

452
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,470
I thought so.

453
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:19,260
Yes, I just wanted to cry.

454
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,110
Though I love having the grandchildren,
of course.

455
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,480
I didn't think Oscar looked well.

456
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:30,780
He wears himself out with that theatre.

457
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:34,620
And the idea of him playing the ghost.

458
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,490
He should take it easy.

459
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,080
Besides, he's an awfully bad actor.

460
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:48,710
I wonder if Emilie realizes that
he's weak and needs rest.

461
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:53,130
I think I'll have a word with her.

462
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:01,020
He's capable, of course.
Capable and conscientious.

463
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:05,900
Can you believe the theatre
even makes a small profit?

464
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,440
Isn't that splendid?

465
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,490
A few years ago I contributed a
minimum of 50,000 kronor per year.

466
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,490
I didn't care, but Oscar felt so
awkward asking me for money.

467
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,990
Not like Carl.

468
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,540
He asked me for a new loan,
but I refused.

469
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:29,180
If he comes to you for money,
you must say no too.

470
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,300
Promise me that.
- Yes, yes.

471
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,340
I don't understand it.

472
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,640
Time and again I clear everything up for him.

473
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:39,140
After a year,
he's in dire straits again.

474
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,820
He says he doesn't go to moneylenders.

475
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,230
- Do you know?
- No.

476
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:52,990
And that poor German woman he's married to.

477
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,660
How could he have fallen for her?

478
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:59,490
It must be something erotic.

479
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,960
What do you think?

480
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:05,330
Erotic? Yes, perhaps.

481
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:07,670
- You're not listening.
- Yes, I am.

482
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:12,040
Never mind.
The main thing is that you keep me company.

483
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:23,810
Carl and Gustav Adolf are oversexed.

484
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,930
They take after their father.
He was oversexed.

485
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:31,150
At times I thought it was
too much of a good thing,

486
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:32,940
but I never refused.

487
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,070
Gustav Adolf is incorrigible.

488
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,950
I've spoken with Alma,
and she wisely says

489
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,540
she doesn't mind his philandering,

490
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:44,790
because he's the kindest husband in the world.

491
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,710
It's fortunate that alma is so understanding.

492
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,350
Perhaps I ought to warn that nursemaid Maj,
or whatever her name is.

493
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,560
I must say she's very pretty,
and good with the children.

494
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,560
Beautiful colouring and a nice figure.

495
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:08,440
Pity she limps,
the poor thing.

496
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,100
What you don't poke your nose into

497
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,110
you don't have to pull it out of,
as grandma used to say.

498
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,780
- Are you asleep?
- No, no.

499
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:27,710
Carl and Gustav Adolf got too much,
and Oscar got nothing.

500
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:32,710
Imagine the tragedy for Emilie,
who's such a warm-blooded young woman.

501
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,300
When she was pregnant with Fanny,
she told me all about it.

502
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,680
Poor girl.

503
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:47,230
I have to say she's handled her
affairs in a most tactful manner.

504
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:52,320
Oscar and Emilie are
enormously fond of each other.

505
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,400
A happy marriage in spite of everything.

506
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,160
Are you sad because you've grown old?

507
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,910
I'm certainly not.
Everything's getting worse.

508
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:11,750
Worse people,
worse machines, worse wars...

509
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:13,920
and worse weather.

510
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:15,670
I'm glad I'll soon be dead.

511
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:20,810
You're an incorrigible old
misanthrope and always have been.

512
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,770
- I don't agree with you.
- I thought as much.

513
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,350
That doesn't stop me from crying.

514
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:33,190
Would you mind if I cry a while?

515
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:51,540
No, upon my soul, I can't.
The tears won't come.

516
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:54,710
I'll have to have some more cognac.

517
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,890
What are you laughing at?

518
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:15,440
Do you remember when we sat
there on the sofa kissing madly?

519
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,650
You had unbuttoned my blouse,

520
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,690
and something else too.

521
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:23,440
Then suddenly the curtain was drawn aside,

522
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:26,570
and there stood my dear husband.

523
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:30,830
It was just like a play by Feydeau.

524
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:36,010
I screamed and you made for the door.

525
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:42,300
He rushed off to get his pistol,
with me hanging on his leg.

526
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:48,390
You became friends for life.

527
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,930
Your husband was a great-hearted man.

528
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,600
Now I'm weeping.

529
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:01,910
The happy,
splendid life is over,

530
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:07,790
and the horrible,
dirty life engulfs us.

531
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:11,330
That's the way it is.

532
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:23,840
This won't do.

533
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,060
I must wash up and redo my makeup,

534
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:31,600
do my hair and put on
my corset and silk dress.

535
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:39,320
A weepy, lovesick woman turns
into a self-possessed grandmother.

536
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,400
We all play our parts.

537
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:46,950
Some play them negligently,
others with great care.

538
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,240
I'm one of the latter.

539
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,130
Good night,
my lovely Helena.

540
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:59,040
You were a sweet lover.

541
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,630
Like strawberries.

542
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,840
You wanted me to help you with
your morning toilet, Mrs. Ekdahl.

543
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:10,140
The time is ten to 5:00.

544
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:16,310
A cafe on castle street.

545
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:22,320
Your own cakes and pastries,

546
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:25,440
tarts and confections.

547
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:31,910
What do you say to that,
little Maj?

548
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:37,000
You'd be in charge of it.

549
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,840
Just yesterday I said to alma,

550
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:46,170
"look at Maj.
She's a princess."

551
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,260
What breasts you have,
my girl.

552
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,350
Let me see properly.

553
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,050
You drive me crazy.

554
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,690
Don't be afraid, child.

555
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,190
I'm a wonderful lover.
All the women say so.

556
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,740
Once you get me on my back,
you'll forget about the cafe.

557
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,950
I swear.

558
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,900
Give me something to write on.

559
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,410
Come. Come over here.

560
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,710
Here's a pen.

561
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:22,050
Now I'll write:

562
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:25,420
"Maja kling...

563
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:33,220
is the proprietress of my cafe."

564
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,940
Signed, Gustav Adolf Ekdahl.

565
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:44,650
Christmas night, 1907.

566
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:49,070
There! That's a contract.

567
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,120
Stick it under a lawyer's
nose if I forget my promise.

568
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,630
Be careful not to put me in the family way.

569
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:17,430
Well, what do you say?
Aren't I nice?

570
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:20,600
Ever felt such a wooden leg?

571
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:24,980
Damnation!
The rocket went off too soon.

572
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:33,990
Oh, well, it happens.
Wasn't it wonderful?

573
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,990
You're a real Billy goat, sir.

574
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:41,280
And you're my little lamb.

575
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:45,790
I must lie on my back.
I'm all in a sweat.

576
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:49,590
- I ate and drank too much.
- You're not ill?

577
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,760
Not me!
I feel like a bakery ablaze.

578
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,220
Or should I say cafe?

579
01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:01,550
Iii?
When I'm with such a tasty little morsel?

580
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:03,850
Sit on top of me.

581
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,150
Oh, you're impossible, sir!

582
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,870
Ride a rocking horse to Banbury cross

583
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,830
to see a fine lady on a white steed

584
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:23,870
what a glorious time we're having!

585
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:44,060
- My goodness, how your heart's pounding.
- I've got a splendid heart.

586
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:47,770
Now you'll have to give me a new bed.

587
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,440
You'll have a cafe,
an apartment,

588
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:54,610
beautiful furniture,
and a big bed.

589
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:58,280
- And pretty clothes.
- No one will be prettier.

590
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:01,330
You will be Gustav Adolf's mistress,

591
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:05,250
and I'll come see you every
Wednesday and Saturday at 3:00.

592
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,410
How silly you are.

593
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,300
- What?
- I said you're silly.

594
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:14,640
- Silly, am I?
- You're a real numbskull.

595
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,970
I'm not a numbskull!

596
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,100
You are,
for imagining I'd want anything from you.

597
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:25,940
Don't you want anything?

598
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,600
Don't you see I was joking?

599
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,650
Joking?

600
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,280
In what way?

601
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,120
Don't be angry.

602
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:44,410
I'm not,
but I don't like being treated like an idiot.

603
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:50,880
- Stop laughing.
- I think you're so funny.

604
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,310
I don't like being laughed at.

605
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,670
I can feel a cold coming on.

606
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:34,300
My throat hurts when I swallow.

607
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,880
My teeth are tingling.

608
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,340
It's freezing in here.
Why isn't there any heat?

609
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,100
We don't have any credit
with the wood merchant.

610
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:51,520
We owe 150 kronor.
Das wei┈t du doch.

611
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:54,770
You haven't learned a damn
bit of Swedish in 23 years.

612
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,610
Speak Swedish!

613
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:58,610
I do my best.

614
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:02,530
Last Tuesday I asked mama for ten
thousand to sort out my affairs.

615
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:07,530
She took out a paper that
said I owed her 37,000.

616
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,950
It's incredible.

617
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,380
- You'll have to go to the Jew.
- I've already been.

618
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:16,710
I'm paying one hell of an
exorbitant interest rate,

619
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,380
and if I don't pay on time,
he'll show the iou to mama.

620
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,050
I have some jewellery.

621
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,220
Idiot.

622
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,730
That would be nice.
Professor Ekdahl running to the pawnbroker.

623
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,010
Aren't you coming to bed?

624
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:41,240
I feel ill.

625
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,450
There was something wrong
with the herring salad.

626
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,070
It tasted stale.

627
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:53,910
I'm sure mama saved it from Easter,
the stingy hag.

628
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:56,380
You don't serve herring salad for Christmas,
damn it.

629
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,630
Why did I marry you?

630
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:06,930
You're ugly,
poor and barren.

631
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,430
You couldn't even give me a child.

632
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,310
You never make love to me.

633
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,650
- Ich sage aber nichts.
- Speak Swedish.

634
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:22,980
Poor Carl.
You're so unhappy.

635
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:25,620
If you weren't so anxious --

636
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:29,950
The dean scolded me.
Said I'm neglecting my lectures.

637
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:33,170
I'm a scientist,

638
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:38,510
the only real scientist in
the whole damn university.

639
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,170
But nobody cares.

640
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,510
Oh, my head.

641
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,050
I have a terrible headache.

642
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:50,890
And we have to go to that damn early service!

643
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:53,600
Coercion at every turn!

644
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,360
No, Carlchen!

645
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:01,480
Then you have to smile matter-of-factly,
"dear mama, how beautiful you are.

646
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,070
You look like a young woman."

647
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,940
"Dear Emilie, I've never seen you play
the Christmas angel so wonderfully."

648
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,820
"How is it, Oscar,

649
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,620
that you succeed in everything you do?"

650
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,500
How do you do that?

651
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:25,040
Come, Carlchen.
Come and sit by me.

652
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:35,100
You smell bad.

653
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:39,890
Have you given up washing,
or are you starting to rot?

654
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:45,520
No.
I don't smell bad at all.

655
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:49,490
You have olfactory hallucinations.

656
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,420
It's bleeding.

657
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:13,300
- Shall I bandage it up?
- No.

658
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:20,730
- Won't you try and get some sleep?
- Yes.

659
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,610
I feel sorry for you,
mein Carlchen.

660
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:29,780
How is it one becomes second-rate?

661
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,830
Can you tell me that?

662
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,540
How does the dust fall?

663
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,920
When has one lost?

664
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,920
First I'm a prince,
heir to the kingdom.

665
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:57,310
Suddenly, before I know it...

666
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:00,770
I'm deposed.

667
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:06,230
Death taps me on the shoulder.

668
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:10,950
The room is cold...

669
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,000
and we can't pay for kindling.

670
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,130
I'm stupid and unkind.

671
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,290
And I'm most unkind...

672
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,970
to the only person who cares for me.

673
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:39,140
You can never forgive me.

674
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:41,810
I'm a shit and a cad.

675
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,650
If you'd like,
I'll make you a hot toddy.

676
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:51,820
Don't be so damned servile!

677
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,150
Wipe your mouth.
Your lips are always wet. It's disgusting!

678
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,700
I don't mean to be unkind.

679
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,000
I know that,
mein liebling.

680
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:12,550
Oh, life!

681
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:25,270
Insomnia, poverty and humiliation.

682
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:32,030
Stretch out your hand and
you grope in the emptiness.

683
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:39,160
Why am I such a bloody coward?

684
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,130
You have your amusements.

685
01:22:57,270 --> 01:23:01,060
- That's enough, mein liebling.
- Nothing troubles you.

686
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:03,100
I strike you and you kiss my hand.

687
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:06,400
I spit on you and you forgive me.
You're repulsive!

688
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:09,060
I can't stand your love.
I have to get away from you.

689
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,940
You'll have to go back to Munich.
We're getting a divorce.

690
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:16,070
I want to finally be spared seeing you,

691
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,200
smelling you,
listening to your damned gibberish.

692
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:24,740
I'll be spared your solicitude,
your anxious eyes,

693
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,090
your cloying love.

694
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:32,920
When you're sad and unhappy,
you always talk like this.

695
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,510
I don't care anymore.
You know that.

696
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,220
I want to sleep.

697
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,930
Maybe I'll dream of a
sweet-smelling female body...

698
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,600
with small breasts and narrow hips,

699
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:48,060
long legs...

700
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,780
dark hair and cheerful personality.

701
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,440
Her legs and arms are wrapped around me,

702
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,370
pressing herself against me.

703
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,120
We make love.

704
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,450
Her flesh is firm and generous.

705
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,040
Damnation!

706
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,210
Old age, prison, disgust!

707
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,850
No, Carlchen!

708
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,810
Stop! Stop it!

709
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:26,140
Don't touch me, damn it!

710
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,660
You know why I hate you so,
mein liebchen?

711
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,540
You're a mirror image.

712
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,840
Kindness reflects kindness.

713
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:56,000
Mediocrity reflects mediocrity.

714
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:00,840
I see it contorting your face.
You suffer, but you endure it.

715
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:06,350
That's the big difference,

716
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:10,310
I will never endure it.

717
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,000
Good night.

718
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:02,620
Well, Gustav Adolf.

719
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:25,760
- Good morning, papa.
- Good morning, Petra.

720
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,430
Don't I get a kiss?

721
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:36,400
- Good morning, Gustav Adolf.
- Good morning, alma.

722
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:42,440
Go and fry three eggs and some ham for papa,

723
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:45,320
and make two cheese sandwiches.

724
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:48,080
- What will you drink?
- Beer.

725
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,540
Petra, you know where the beer crate is.

726
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:55,950
No, wait,
I think there's some stout in the cupboard.

727
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,960
- Would you rather have stout?
- Yes.

728
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:05,300
Don't stand there staring.
We have to be at grandma's in an hour.

729
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,810
- How do you feel?
- Cognac.

730
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,430
- I've put out your clothes.
- Thank you.

731
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:23,200
And there's hot water if you want a bath.

732
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:24,910
That would be nice.

733
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,360
Hurry up now.

734
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:55,390
You're a damned handsome woman.

735
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,890
And you're a big shit.

736
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:12,080
- Come to bed.
- I just did my hair.

737
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:16,450
We'll have a quick one standing up.

738
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:20,880
- Petra's coming with breakfast.
- We'll lock the door.

739
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:25,220
Come on then,
but make it quick.

740
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:12,260
- I don't think I can.
- You can't?

741
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,850
No.
There must be something wrong.

742
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,610
- You're not sick, are you?
- I'm fit as a fiddle.

743
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:26,770
- Lie down on the bed.
- Yes, I guess I could do that.

744
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:35,490
- Shall I bring in the breakfast tray?
- Yes, please.

745
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:38,990
To think that I haven't killed you.

746
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,880
Now what do you say?

747
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,830
I wonder if it will be a cold day.

748
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,960
I think it'll be very cold.

749
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:24,920
My thermometer says 4* below.

750
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:50,570
Don't yawn at the table, Alexander.

751
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:57,870
Cheers, brother Carl.

752
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:14,210
I heard the Bishop will be
saying the service today.

753
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:15,710
Really?

754
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:22,090
I can't help it.
Your father's a bit nutty.

755
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:24,060
Excuse me.

756
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:36,070
Well, my friends,
it's time.

757
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:41,040
THE SECOND ACT

758
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:46,090
THE GHOST REHEARSAL

759
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:15,330
My hour is almost come

760
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:19,660
when I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames

761
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,330
must render up myself.

762
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:24,630
Alas, poor ghost.

763
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,050
Pity me not,

764
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:31,260
but lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold.

765
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:33,510
Speak.
I am bound to hear.

766
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:38,350
So art thou to revenge,
when thou shalt hear --

767
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,720
What?

768
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,150
I am thy father's spirit.

769
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:47,150
Doomed for a certain term to walk the night,

770
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:51,120
and for the day confined to fast in fires

771
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:56,200
till the foul crimes done in my days of nature

772
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:59,500
are burnt and purged away.

773
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:03,840
But that I am forbid to tell

774
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:08,220
the secrets of my prison house

775
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,590
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word

776
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:17,100
would harrow up thy soul,

777
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:21,810
freeze thy young blood,

778
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:27,650
make thy two eyes like stars
start from their spheres.

779
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:31,190
But this eternal blazon

780
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:34,900
must not be to ears of flesh and blood.

781
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:44,420
List, o list!

782
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,790
If thou didst ever thy dear father love...

783
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:50,210
o God!

784
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:55,640
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

785
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:57,050
Murder!

786
01:38:57,190 --> 01:38:58,430
Yes, murder!

787
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:03,600
Murder most foul,
as in the best it is.

788
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:06,230
But this most foul...

789
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:09,310
strange --

790
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,940
- ...and unnatural.
- Huh?

791
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,650
And unnatural.

792
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:21,870
Haste me to know't, that I,
with wings as swift as meditation

793
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,620
or the thoughts of love,
may sweep to my revenge.

794
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,710
Now, Hamlet, hear.

795
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:30,670
'Tis given out,
that sleeping in my orchard,

796
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:33,790
a serpent stung me.

797
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:36,970
So the whole ear of Denmark

798
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:42,390
is by a forged process of
my death rankly abused.

799
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:46,980
But know,
thou noble youth -

800
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:50,570
the serpent that did sting thy father's life.

801
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:52,810
Huh? Did sting?

802
01:39:52,990 --> 01:39:55,730
Thy father's life.

803
01:39:55,870 --> 01:39:59,830
Did sting thy father's life

804
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:03,000
now wears his crown

805
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:05,910
o my prophetic soul!
My uncle?

806
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:09,710
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast,

807
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,870
with witchcraft of his wit,

808
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:16,750
with traitorous gifts -

809
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:22,180
o wicked wit and gifts,
that have the power so to seduce -

810
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,100
won to his shameful lust the will

811
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:30,690
of my most seeming-virtuous queen.

812
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:38,990
But soft!

813
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:45,540
Methinks I scent the morning air.

814
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:53,510
Mr. Landahl,
shouldn't there be steps here?

815
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:57,800
Can somebody help Mr. Ekdahl down.

816
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:00,510
The steps were forgotten today.

817
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:09,270
Brief let me be.

818
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:15,690
Sleeping within my orchard my
custom always of the afternoon

819
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:21,070
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole

820
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:25,660
with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial

821
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:31,790
and in the porches of my ears
did pour the leperous distilment,

822
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:38,180
whose effect holds such an
enmity with blood of man

823
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:41,590
that swift as quicksilver it courses through

824
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:44,760
the natural gates and alleys of the body

825
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:48,680
and with a sudden vigour
it doth possess and curd,

826
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:54,280
like eager droppings into milk,
the thin and wholesome blood:

827
01:41:55,280 --> 01:42:01,320
So did it mine and a most
instant tetter bark'd about

828
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:06,740
most lazar-like,
with vile and loathsome crust

829
01:42:07,170 --> 01:42:09,500
all my smooth body.

830
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:18,250
Thus was I, sleeping,
by a brother's hand...

831
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:25,470
of life, of crown, of queen,
at once dispatched.

832
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:31,100
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,

833
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:37,150
unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
no reckoning made

834
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:43,490
but sent to my account with all
my imperfections on my head.

835
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:48,450
Oh, horrible,
most horrible!

836
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:51,790
If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not.

837
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:55,830
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be

838
01:42:56,010 --> 01:43:02,380
a couch for luxury and damned incest.

839
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:13,230
I've forgotten what I am to do.

840
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,140
You get up and exit upstage centre.

841
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:41,170
- Where am I?
- Here... at the theatre.

842
01:44:06,450 --> 01:44:08,440
Let's go home and rest.

843
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:15,570
What's happened?

844
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,240
You're tired, that's all.

845
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,540
Shall I call for the ambulance?

846
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,300
What am I doing here?

847
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:31,640
You were acting.

848
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,050
I was acting?

849
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,480
Why was I acting?

850
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:43,060
Come along, Oscar.
Let's go home.

851
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:51,370
Am I going to die now?

852
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,490
Please help me.

853
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:58,450
I'll get a carriage.

854
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:03,540
He needs his overcoat.

855
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,440
Alexander, come along.

856
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,540
Come on.

857
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:05,150
Stop!

858
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:09,980
I said stop! Hey, you!

859
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:17,360
Take the cart behind you!

860
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,900
Come along, Alexander.

861
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,080
No.

862
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,050
No.

863
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:51,290
We know nothing yet.

864
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:56,960
Yes, let's hope so.
Thank you for calling.

865
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:13,280
- How is our dear Oscar?
- We can only hope.

866
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:47,220
- How is he?
- It's a matter of hours.

867
01:48:47,690 --> 01:48:50,680
- Is he in pain?
- He sleeps most of the time.

868
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:08,660
Go see ester and Vega for hot
chocolate and sandwiches.

869
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:20,840
I was over at the Gustavssons'
and I met Mr. Albrektsson.

870
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:22,930
Just imagine, children.

871
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:27,980
This letter will go all the
way to a mission in china.

872
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:32,560
Mr. Albrektsson told me his
poodle had four puppies.

873
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:37,230
A friend of mine has lived there for 50 years.

874
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:43,580
He wondered if you'd like a puppy.

875
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:46,530
Mama won't let us have dogs or cats.

876
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:48,910
- We could keep it here.
- Really?

877
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,450
- Yes.
- Splendid.

878
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:52,540
Otherwise it'll be sold.

879
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:57,380
When I was in china,
working in the fields with my friend,

880
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,670
we had a dog and three cats.

881
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:06,510
- Want to play again?
- You take red, then.

882
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:12,270
Mr. Albrektsson makes
lots of money on his dogs,

883
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,360
but he wants to give this puppy away.

884
01:50:14,490 --> 01:50:16,150
He's wealthy in his own right.

885
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:20,110
It's his wife's money,
dear ester.

886
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:29,820
Would you two like a molasses sandwich?

887
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:32,540
Yes, please, miss Vega.

888
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:37,380
There, the letter's finished.

889
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,300
Come, Fanny,
and I'll let you lick the envelope.

890
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:49,550
- Would you like to borrow the flute?
- No, thank you.

891
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:54,060
- You want to lick the stamp?
- No, thank you.

892
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:57,230
You lick the stamp, then.

893
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:03,990
Thank you, sweetheart.

894
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,910
Leave me alone.

895
01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:26,010
Come in.

896
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:38,480
Your mama asked me to come get you.

897
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,730
Let's put down the sandwiches.

898
01:51:58,970 --> 01:52:00,710
Hurry up, Alexander.

899
01:52:59,610 --> 01:53:01,850
Come, Alexander.
Don't be afraid.

900
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:14,280
Come here, Alexander.

901
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,420
Come on.

902
01:54:12,350 --> 01:54:14,090
I'll wait outside.

903
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:19,560
Come here, Fanny.

904
01:54:35,410 --> 01:54:38,530
Tell Alexander there's nothing to be afraid of.

905
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:40,700
I'll tell him.

906
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:51,300
You needn't be afraid.

907
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:55,800
This is nothing to worry about.

908
01:54:58,060 --> 01:54:59,850
I feel no pain.

909
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:08,190
I actually feel better than I have in a long time.

910
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:16,900
Don't be alarmed if I keep my eyes closed.

911
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:22,500
The light seems rather bright.

912
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:29,880
It doesn't matter if I close my eyes.

913
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:45,390
I could play the ghost now...

914
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:49,390
really well.

915
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:59,700
Nothing.

916
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:05,170
Nothing...

917
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:09,040
separates me from all of you.

918
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:11,130
Not now...

919
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:13,920
and not later.

920
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:18,630
I know that.

921
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:25,440
I see it...

922
01:56:28,030 --> 01:56:30,640
quite clearly.

923
01:56:32,110 --> 01:56:34,980
I'll be closer to you now...

924
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:38,990
than when I lived.

925
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:47,040
Now I'd like to look at Alexander.

926
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:03,140
Father says there's nothing to be afraid of.

927
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:15,730
Don't be childish now.

928
01:57:16,030 --> 01:57:19,070
Try to be a good boy.

929
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:12,120
Take care of the theatre.

930
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:19,260
Mr. Sandblad will explain the business side.

931
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:26,090
Artistic matters you'll decide on your own...

932
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:30,520
as usual.

933
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:37,900
A simple funeral.

934
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:40,320
Don't forget.

935
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,950
Nothing Majestic in the cathedral...

936
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:49,870
with Chopin's "funeral march."

937
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:54,750
Promise me that.

938
01:59:03,770 --> 01:59:08,100
Everything must go on as usual.

939
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:16,430
Everything must go on as usual.

940
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:23,030
I'll soon be dead.

941
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:28,540
Will you hold my hand?

942
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:35,290
Eternity, Emilie.

943
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:38,300
Eternity.

944
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:45,290
Fanny, wake up.
You hear that?

945
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,830
My condolences.

946
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:54,470
Allow me to assure you

947
02:03:55,100 --> 02:03:58,810
that my family and I feel
the very greatest sympathy

948
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:03,850
in this difficult hour that has befallen
you and your esteemed family.

949
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:08,610
It is our regiment's duty and honour,

950
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:12,350
in keeping with our proud tradition,

951
02:04:12,490 --> 02:04:17,410
to be allowed to express our
sympathy at the funeral service.

952
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:24,290
Allow me to kiss your hand
in veneration and affection...

953
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:31,250
and venture so boldly as to offer all
the support an imperfect mortal can.

954
02:04:43,150 --> 02:04:45,980
Alexander, come out.
The Bishop will be here any moment.

955
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:47,220
I don't give a damn!

956
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:49,270
Come out now.
Don't be stupid.

957
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:30,720
My deepest sympathy.

958
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:16,400
My dear Emilie Ekdahl...

959
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:20,530
words are so inadequate.

960
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:47,010
Let's gather together.

961
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:53,520
Right foot.

962
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:16,920
It is with dismay that we
gather around Oscar's bier.

963
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:24,090
A close friend has been taken,
and we're left in distress.

964
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:32,100
We actors,
who daily play with life and death,

965
02:07:32,730 --> 02:07:35,220
should not be so upset,

966
02:07:36,030 --> 02:07:40,820
but oddly enough,
our dismay is greater --

967
02:07:42,330 --> 02:07:43,820
...greater than others'.

968
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:19,480
The hour before he died,
he was conscious.

969
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,860
He even laughed.

970
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:26,860
We spoke of practical things...

971
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:29,940
the children's future

972
02:08:31,290 --> 02:08:33,330
and business matters.

973
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:49,220
We also spoke of our theatre.

974
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:52,050
Oscar said,

975
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:56,560
"everything must go on as usual, Emilie."

976
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,520
So we'll carry on as usual.

977
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:07,070
At Oscar's request,
I'll take over management of the theatre.

978
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:10,690
We resume rehearsals tomorrow.

979
02:09:12,290 --> 02:09:15,410
The premiere of Hamlet
will proceed as announced.

980
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:19,960
That's everything.

981
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:23,460
We'll all do our best.

982
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,710
Thank you.

983
02:09:27,930 --> 02:09:29,590
Dear Emilie.

984
02:09:38,110 --> 02:09:39,720
Oscar will be proud.

985
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:49,440
I'm so happy for your sake,
dear Emilie.

986
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:07,820
Cock, piss, shit, fart,

987
02:11:07,950 --> 02:11:10,810
piss, hell, shit,

988
02:11:10,950 --> 02:11:14,160
cock, fart, shit, piss,

989
02:11:14,290 --> 02:11:18,200
fart, cock, cunt, damn, hell,

990
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:22,540
crap, ass, piss, cock, butt, pussy.

991
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:12,550
Siri, tell the children they may leave the table.

992
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:14,010
Yes, ma'am.

993
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:17,900
Did you hear something?

994
02:13:36,010 --> 02:13:37,840
Alexander, wake up!

995
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:40,090
There's something out there.

996
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:44,610
THE THIRD ACT

997
02:14:46,330 --> 02:14:49,370
BREAK-UP

998
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:58,510
When that I was and a little tiny boy

999
02:14:58,640 --> 02:15:02,970
with a hey, ho,
the wind and the rain.

1000
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:07,590
A foolish thing was but a toy

1001
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:11,930
for the rain it raineth every day.

1002
02:15:12,110 --> 02:15:15,730
Did you hear Emilie wants to talk
to us after the performance?

1003
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:18,610
Doesn't sound good.

1004
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:21,110
No.

1005
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:25,280
But when I came to man's estate

1006
02:15:25,410 --> 02:15:29,910
with hey, ho,
the wind and the rain

1007
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:34,580
'gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate.

1008
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:39,300
For the rain it raineth every day.

1009
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:56,810
But when I came, alas,
to wive

1010
02:15:56,990 --> 02:16:01,230
with hey, ho,
the wind and the rain.

1011
02:16:01,370 --> 02:16:05,700
By swaggering could I never thrive.

1012
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:10,080
For the rain it raineth every day.

1013
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:14,540
Emilie, you want to speak with us afterwards?

1014
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:18,630
What is it about?

1015
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:26,050
But when I came unto my beds

1016
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:30,430
with hey, ho,
the wind and the rain.

1017
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:34,800
With tosspots still had drunken heads.

1018
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:40,020
For the rain it raineth every day.

1019
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:45,360
A great while ago the world begun

1020
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:50,280
with hey, ho,
the wind and the rain.

1021
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:56,910
But that's all one,
our play is done

1022
02:16:57,800 --> 02:17:00,410
and we'll strive to please you every day.

1023
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:13,050
Well, that's that.

1024
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:18,310
Better hurry up,
you old ghost.

1025
02:17:18,900 --> 02:17:20,770
It's all a bunch of crap.

1026
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:46,310
If you'd please sit down,
I'd like to talk to you.

1027
02:18:58,580 --> 02:19:00,830
My husband died a year ago today.

1028
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:04,340
He wanted us to go on as usual,

1029
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,750
and we have gone on as usual,

1030
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:10,010
though everything has been different.

1031
02:19:13,430 --> 02:19:17,050
We draw the theatre over our
heads like a security blanket.

1032
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:20,050
Our dressing rooms are bright and warm.

1033
02:19:20,810 --> 02:19:23,730
The stage enfolds us in friendly shadows.

1034
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:27,690
Playwrights tell us what to say and think.

1035
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:30,350
We laugh, cry and rage.

1036
02:19:30,490 --> 02:19:33,530
People sit there in the dark,
kindly disposed towards us.

1037
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:35,530
They're remarkably loyal,

1038
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:39,080
though we often give them
stones instead of bread.

1039
02:19:39,210 --> 02:19:41,290
Most of the time we're simply playing.

1040
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:44,000
Almost always.

1041
02:19:44,550 --> 02:19:47,160
We play because we enjoy it.

1042
02:19:47,590 --> 02:19:51,250
And if we don't enjoy it,
we sulk and blame the circumstances...

1043
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:53,970
never ourselves.

1044
02:19:58,190 --> 02:19:59,720
That's how it is.

1045
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:08,770
So I pass my life in wonderful self-deception,

1046
02:20:09,700 --> 02:20:14,030
with a keen eye for others' faults
while glossing over my own.

1047
02:20:14,910 --> 02:20:16,740
I don't know what I really am,

1048
02:20:17,290 --> 02:20:20,320
as I never cared to find
out the truth about myself.

1049
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:23,660
But I do care about myself,

1050
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:25,530
which is something different.

1051
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:30,790
And I don't care about reality, either.

1052
02:20:31,260 --> 02:20:33,170
It's drab and uninteresting.

1053
02:20:34,010 --> 02:20:35,590
It doesn't concern me,

1054
02:20:35,970 --> 02:20:40,260
unless, in one way or another,
it concerns the part I'm playing.

1055
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:45,470
Are you tired of the theatre?

1056
02:20:46,530 --> 02:20:47,940
I think so.

1057
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:52,230
- You want to quit?
- Perhaps, and for good.

1058
02:20:54,530 --> 02:20:56,490
What will happen to us if you quit?

1059
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:59,780
Even if I quit,
everything will go on as before.

1060
02:21:00,290 --> 02:21:01,950
Who will be our manager?

1061
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:04,910
We'll all decide that together
when the day comes,

1062
02:21:05,130 --> 02:21:06,710
if it comes.

1063
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:08,870
I haven't yet made up my mind.

1064
02:21:09,550 --> 02:21:11,830
Now I suggest we say good night.

1065
02:21:11,970 --> 02:21:13,830
Good night.

1066
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:15,710
Come children.
Let's change.

1067
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:25,800
I need a drink and a sandwich.

1068
02:21:27,150 --> 02:21:28,760
Anyone care to join me?

1069
02:21:30,190 --> 02:21:32,480
I've received an offer from the Lindberg troupe,

1070
02:21:32,650 --> 02:21:34,320
so it's all the same to me.

1071
02:21:37,950 --> 02:21:39,530
What did I tell you?

1072
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:45,460
I think there's something behind this.

1073
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:48,330
- Haven't you heard?
- You mean it's true?

1074
02:21:53,550 --> 02:21:55,090
Well, I'll be damned.

1075
02:22:32,130 --> 02:22:36,790
If music be the food of love,
play on.

1076
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:42,220
Give me excess of it, that,
surfeiting --

1077
02:22:42,390 --> 02:22:45,100
Come, Alexander.
Stop fooling around.

1078
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:46,760
Come on.

1079
02:23:34,110 --> 02:23:36,020
Good day, Alexander.

1080
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:38,280
Please give my regards to your mother.

1081
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:57,630
- You're gonna be sorry.
- What do you mean?

1082
02:23:57,760 --> 02:23:59,870
You'll soon find out.

1083
02:24:11,310 --> 02:24:12,390
Hi.

1084
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:28,530
What's wrong?

1085
02:24:52,190 --> 02:24:54,020
Someone wishes to talk to you.

1086
02:24:54,190 --> 02:24:56,020
The hot chocolate will have to wait.

1087
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:06,190
- What have I done?
- You know quite well.

1088
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:22,290
- Good day, Alexander.
- Good day.

1089
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:25,840
We met once before.

1090
02:25:25,970 --> 02:25:29,010
Under sadder circumstances,
when I officiated at your father's funeral.

1091
02:25:30,770 --> 02:25:35,390
Since then, your mother has turned to
me with her worries, as is only natural.

1092
02:25:36,730 --> 02:25:39,570
I am a close friend of your grandmother.

1093
02:25:40,650 --> 02:25:42,730
I'm the spiritual guide of the parish.

1094
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:47,110
The Bishop has been very good
to me during this difficult time.

1095
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:50,330
We've also spoken of you,
my son.

1096
02:25:50,450 --> 02:25:53,620
I've told the Bishop how proud I
am of my well-behaved children.

1097
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:56,500
You and your sister are doing well at school,
I'm told.

1098
02:25:56,630 --> 02:25:59,120
Diligent and attentive,
and earning good grades.

1099
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:01,410
Isn't that so, Alexander?

1100
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:04,960
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend and wish you well.

1101
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:07,260
You believe me,
don't you?

1102
02:26:08,930 --> 02:26:12,760
But diligence and good grades
are not everything in this world.

1103
02:26:12,930 --> 02:26:14,470
Blow your nose, Alexander.

1104
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:23,780
That's filthy!
Didn't Maj give you a clean handkerchief?

1105
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:25,360
Yes.

1106
02:26:25,490 --> 02:26:26,820
Goddamn it all!

1107
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:34,950
As I said, diligence and good grades
aren't everything in this world.

1108
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:37,160
Listen to the Bishop, Alexander.

1109
02:26:37,290 --> 02:26:38,870
I'm sure he is.

1110
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:41,660
Isn't that so, Alexander?

1111
02:26:42,130 --> 02:26:44,540
You're anxious to know what I'm going to say.

1112
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:48,000
You're a big boy now.

1113
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:51,670
So I'll talk to you man to man.

1114
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:56,140
Can you tell me --

1115
02:26:56,730 --> 02:27:00,140
Can you explain to me

1116
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:02,730
what a lie is

1117
02:27:03,150 --> 02:27:05,310
and what the truth is?

1118
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:13,150
You think that was a stupid question,
and it probably was.

1119
02:27:13,330 --> 02:27:15,190
I was just kidding with you.

1120
02:27:15,330 --> 02:27:18,700
Of course you know what a lie is
and what the truth is, don't you?

1121
02:27:20,340 --> 02:27:21,500
Splendid.

1122
02:27:23,090 --> 02:27:24,450
Splendid, my boy.

1123
02:27:26,420 --> 02:27:29,880
You also know why one lies.

1124
02:27:33,010 --> 02:27:34,600
Why does one lie?

1125
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:39,510
Why does one lie?

1126
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:43,270
Can you explain to me why one lies?

1127
02:27:45,150 --> 02:27:47,020
Because you don't want to tell the truth.

1128
02:27:51,740 --> 02:27:54,110
A very sly answer,
my young friend.

1129
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:58,320
But you won't get off so easily.

1130
02:27:58,580 --> 02:28:00,790
I asked you...

1131
02:28:04,050 --> 02:28:06,290
why does one not tell the truth?

1132
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:08,250
I don't know.

1133
02:28:10,470 --> 02:28:12,330
We have plenty of time, Alexander,

1134
02:28:12,470 --> 02:28:14,550
and I'm so interested in your answer

1135
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:16,640
that I'm prepared to wait indefinitely.

1136
02:28:18,350 --> 02:28:21,220
You may not believe that,
but it's true.

1137
02:28:23,150 --> 02:28:25,060
One lies to gain an advantage.

1138
02:28:25,570 --> 02:28:28,060
Good answer, my boy.

1139
02:28:28,860 --> 02:28:30,690
Good and concise.

1140
02:28:32,370 --> 02:28:36,150
Forgive me if I ask another question,
a bit more personal this time.

1141
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:42,410
Can you explain to your mother
and me why you lied at school?

1142
02:28:42,790 --> 02:28:43,830
What?

1143
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:47,450
Your teacher has written to me,

1144
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:50,420
saying that you've been
spreading the most incredible lies.

1145
02:28:50,550 --> 02:28:51,630
Like what?

1146
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:53,840
Sold to a circus!

1147
02:28:54,510 --> 02:28:57,600
Do you deny that you told your classmates

1148
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:01,310
that I sold you to a travelling circus,

1149
02:29:02,100 --> 02:29:04,640
and that at the end of the semester

1150
02:29:04,770 --> 02:29:07,230
they're coming to get you?

1151
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:11,940
You are to train as an acrobat and circus rider,

1152
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:16,030
together with a gypsy your age named Tamara.

1153
02:29:20,710 --> 02:29:24,240
Your mother was both terrified and
upset when she read the letter.

1154
02:29:25,590 --> 02:29:27,170
She didn't know what to do.

1155
02:29:28,590 --> 02:29:30,330
So I suggested I come over

1156
02:29:30,470 --> 02:29:32,550
and discuss these unpleasant
problems with you.

1157
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:36,460
And here I am.

1158
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:39,210
You should be grateful to the
Bishop for taking the time.

1159
02:29:39,350 --> 02:29:40,960
Do you understand, Alexander?

1160
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:48,390
We've agreed that he who lies
does so to gain an advantage.

1161
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:51,980
So I ask, quite logically,

1162
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:57,030
what advantage did you gain by stating
your mother had sold you to a circus?

1163
02:29:58,330 --> 02:29:59,690
I don't know.

1164
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:04,780
I think you do know...

1165
02:30:06,420 --> 02:30:08,330
but you're ashamed to answer.

1166
02:30:12,470 --> 02:30:14,670
You're ashamed,
aren't you?

1167
02:30:15,550 --> 02:30:18,540
That's good,
my son. Very good.

1168
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:22,760
It shows you'll be on your guard

1169
02:30:22,890 --> 02:30:24,880
against further fabrications in the future.

1170
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:29,850
Go to your mother and ask her forgiveness

1171
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:32,770
for all the sorrow and worry you've caused her.

1172
02:30:35,950 --> 02:30:38,230
Go to your mother and ask her to forgive you.

1173
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:44,690
You hear what I say,
don't you?

1174
02:30:51,630 --> 02:30:55,040
I ask mother's forgiveness for lying,
and I promise never to do it again.

1175
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,790
Good, Alexander.

1176
02:30:56,930 --> 02:30:59,590
The matter is resolved and
need never be mentioned again.

1177
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:04,640
Imagination is a splendid thing,

1178
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:07,560
a mighty force,
a gift from God.

1179
02:31:10,980 --> 02:31:14,940
It's held in trust for us by the great artists,

1180
02:31:15,450 --> 02:31:17,230
writers and musicians.

1181
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:28,620
I'll get Fanny.

1182
02:31:46,270 --> 02:31:47,720
Come, Alexander.

1183
02:31:49,480 --> 02:31:51,440
I have something important to tell you.

1184
02:31:54,360 --> 02:31:57,020
Edvard has asked if I will marry him.

1185
02:31:57,740 --> 02:32:00,480
I've accepted with gratitude and joy.

1186
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:03,950
I've been alone for a long time,

1187
02:32:04,910 --> 02:32:07,950
and my children need a firm hand.

1188
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:09,700
A father.

1189
02:32:12,130 --> 02:32:14,710
Of course,
a great deal will be --

1190
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:24,640
May God in his mercy take
care of our little family.

1191
02:32:27,560 --> 02:32:32,470
Let us kneel down and
unite in a heartfelt prayer.

1192
02:32:42,490 --> 02:32:47,580
May God our father in his mercy
take care of our little family

1193
02:32:48,410 --> 02:32:52,330
and bless us and keep us from
evil all the days of our life.

1194
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:58,960
God give me strength

1195
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:01,750
to be a guardian and a worthy example

1196
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:03,380
to these little fatherless ones.

1197
02:33:05,180 --> 02:33:09,420
Give me strength as well to be a support

1198
02:33:11,230 --> 02:33:13,510
to this lonely young woman.

1199
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:25,190
In the 15th century,
when this house was built,

1200
02:33:25,330 --> 02:33:27,570
they didn't bother much about comfort.

1201
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:33,820
My predecessors kept it all as it was,
and I follow the tradition.

1202
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:39,750
These old rooms have an imperishable beauty.

1203
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:46,670
We should be grateful that we may live
in an atmosphere of purity and austerity.

1204
02:33:47,310 --> 02:33:49,920
Ah, here come my mother and sister.

1205
02:33:50,060 --> 02:33:51,640
You're already here.

1206
02:33:52,770 --> 02:33:54,930
Welcome, Mrs. Ekdahl.

1207
02:33:55,230 --> 02:33:56,090
Thank you.

1208
02:33:56,900 --> 02:33:59,060
This is my sister Henrietta.

1209
02:33:59,730 --> 02:34:02,480
- Welcome to the Bishop's palace.
- Thank you.

1210
02:34:03,990 --> 02:34:05,900
Come and say hello, children.

1211
02:34:10,870 --> 02:34:13,910
This is Mrs. Tander,
our capable cook,

1212
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:16,160
who's been with our family for 30 years.

1213
02:34:16,290 --> 02:34:19,380
This is my future wife, Mrs.
Emilie Ekdahl.

1214
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:22,090
Good day, Mrs.
Ekdahl. Welcome.

1215
02:34:23,090 --> 02:34:28,260
These are our capable helpers: Karna,
Selma and little Justina.

1216
02:34:28,760 --> 02:34:32,010
Now we'll go see my aunt, who, alas,
is sick and bedridden.

1217
02:34:56,790 --> 02:34:58,950
How are you today,
aunt Elsa?

1218
02:35:00,250 --> 02:35:02,790
We have a visitor.

1219
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:04,960
Don't be afraid, children.
Come and say hello.

1220
02:35:05,090 --> 02:35:09,960
My future wife, Mrs.
Emilie Ekdahl, the famous actress.

1221
02:35:11,310 --> 02:35:12,640
Hello, miss Bergius.

1222
02:35:49,220 --> 02:35:51,250
The children have fallen asleep.

1223
02:35:51,390 --> 02:35:53,130
It's late and we must go home.

1224
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:56,010
- Not yet.
- What is it, Edvard?

1225
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:58,510
I have a wish.

1226
02:35:59,270 --> 02:36:01,180
A single wish,
but an important one.

1227
02:36:01,310 --> 02:36:05,150
You may change your mind
if you find it impossible.

1228
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:06,860
Tell me your wish.

1229
02:36:07,530 --> 02:36:11,690
I want you to come to my
house without possessions.

1230
02:36:12,870 --> 02:36:14,450
What do you mean?

1231
02:36:18,250 --> 02:36:20,200
I want you to leave your home...

1232
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,370
your clothes, jewels, furniture...

1233
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:27,950
your valuables...

1234
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:32,630
your friends,
habits and thoughts.

1235
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:37,550
I want you to leave your former life entirely.

1236
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:41,050
Am I to come naked?

1237
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:44,020
I'm serious, my dear.

1238
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:48,070
I want you to come to your
new life as if newly born.

1239
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:50,440
- And the children?
- The children also.

1240
02:36:50,570 --> 02:36:54,060
- Their toys, dolls, books...
- Nothing.

1241
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:00,900
- I must talk to them.
- It's your decision.

1242
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:04,120
I can decide for myself,
but not for the children.

1243
02:37:05,250 --> 02:37:06,740
I must ask them.

1244
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:09,250
They must sacrifice something
for their mother's happiness.

1245
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:11,260
You're angry.

1246
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:14,170
Kiss me.

1247
02:37:21,810 --> 02:37:23,770
I'm not angry,
not in the least.

1248
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:25,430
I'll win them over.

1249
02:37:25,690 --> 02:37:28,100
Think it over, Emilie.

1250
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:31,400
I've already thought it over.

1251
02:37:32,570 --> 02:37:35,480
For me it's not hard to grant your wish.

1252
02:37:37,790 --> 02:37:40,370
I've never cared for anything very seriously.

1253
02:37:42,170 --> 02:37:43,870
I've sometimes wondered

1254
02:37:44,130 --> 02:37:47,290
if there wasn't something
very wrong with my feelings.

1255
02:37:48,630 --> 02:37:51,460
I couldn't understand why nothing really hurt...

1256
02:37:52,630 --> 02:37:54,970
why I never felt really happy.

1257
02:37:57,810 --> 02:38:00,260
I know now that the crucial moment has come.

1258
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:05,590
I know that we'll hurt each other,

1259
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:08,100
but I'm not afraid.

1260
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:10,930
I also know that we will
make each other happy.

1261
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:15,980
And I sometimes weep from fear,
because time is so short,

1262
02:38:16,120 --> 02:38:18,820
the days pass so quickly,
and nothing lasts forever.

1263
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:22,580
You say your God is the God of love.

1264
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:25,780
It sounds so beautiful...

1265
02:38:28,170 --> 02:38:30,630
and I wish I could believe as you do.

1266
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:34,410
Perhaps one day I will.

1267
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:39,010
My God is so different, Edvard.

1268
02:38:40,350 --> 02:38:41,840
He's like myself,

1269
02:38:43,060 --> 02:38:46,390
amorphous and intangible.

1270
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:52,060
I'm an actress.
I'm used to wearing masks.

1271
02:38:53,950 --> 02:38:56,150
My God wears a thousand masks.

1272
02:38:57,200 --> 02:38:59,780
He's never shown me his real face,

1273
02:39:00,790 --> 02:39:04,070
just as I can't show you or him my real face.

1274
02:39:07,830 --> 02:39:12,700
Through you I'll come to
know God's true nature.

1275
02:39:14,220 --> 02:39:15,880
Kiss me, now,

1276
02:39:16,010 --> 02:39:19,220
and hold me in your arms,
as only you can.

1277
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:30,400
I, Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus...

1278
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:39,900
take thee,
Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl...

1279
02:39:44,870 --> 02:39:47,410
to be my wedded wife...

1280
02:39:51,090 --> 02:39:53,920
to love you for better and for worse...

1281
02:39:58,050 --> 02:40:02,590
and as a symbol of this
love I give you this ring.

1282
02:40:11,650 --> 02:40:16,140
I, Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl...

1283
02:40:20,450 --> 02:40:24,610
take thee,
Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus,

1284
02:40:28,660 --> 02:40:31,250
to be my wedded husband...

1285
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:36,620
to love you for better and for worse...

1286
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:43,670
and as a symbol of this love I take this ring.

1287
02:40:52,190 --> 02:40:58,180
In the name of God the father,
son and holy ghost.

1288
02:40:58,320 --> 02:40:59,930
Amen.

1289
02:41:02,490 --> 02:41:06,650
For as much as you have
consented in holy wedlock

1290
02:41:06,910 --> 02:41:13,700
and have witnessed the same before
God and this Christian gathering,

1291
02:41:15,340 --> 02:41:21,000
I hereby confirm,
as Christ' servant,

1292
02:41:21,130 --> 02:41:23,880
this holy union.

1293
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:32,140
I wonder if this is a good thing.

1294
02:41:32,440 --> 02:41:35,300
You saw how happy she was.

1295
02:41:35,730 --> 02:41:39,020
- I'm thinking of the children.
- They'll get used to it, dear mama.

1296
02:41:42,530 --> 02:41:45,690
He's a devil of a lady killer,
the Bishop is.

1297
02:41:45,870 --> 02:41:47,860
You don't know that for sure, Carl.

1298
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:51,700
I don't know why I just want to cry.

1299
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:55,080
They should have taken a honeymoon.

1300
02:41:55,210 --> 02:41:58,140
I invited them to our house in Provence,

1301
02:41:58,140 --> 02:41:59,080
but Emilie refused.

1302
02:41:59,210 --> 02:42:01,200
That's not so strange.

1303
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:03,800
She has great respect for her new husband.

1304
02:42:04,550 --> 02:42:07,210
He's a handsome man,
whatever you say.

1305
02:42:07,390 --> 02:42:11,130
- I expect he has false teeth.
- Petra, don't be silly.

1306
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:14,020
His mother was nice.

1307
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:16,730
They say the sister's a bitch.

1308
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:20,060
I've a feeling we'll have Emilie back...

1309
02:42:21,900 --> 02:42:23,730
quite soon.

1310
02:42:24,740 --> 02:42:27,700
Closed

1311
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:45,400
the children don't appear to have an appetite.

1312
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:49,650
Everything's new and strange to them.
You must understand, Henrietta.

1313
02:43:49,820 --> 02:43:53,360
Perhaps they're turning up
their noses at the food.

1314
02:43:55,540 --> 02:43:58,030
Let's be happy on our first evening together.

1315
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:01,450
I have no desire to spoil it,

1316
02:44:02,170 --> 02:44:05,040
but in the future --

1317
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:08,590
Yes, I might as well mention it now.

1318
02:44:09,090 --> 02:44:12,180
In the future no one may leave the
table without having eaten up --

1319
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:16,670
Dearest Henrietta,
I'll tell my children what to do.

1320
02:44:16,850 --> 02:44:21,190
There's a basic rule in this
house which no one must break,

1321
02:44:21,610 --> 02:44:23,810
not even you,
dear Emilie,

1322
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:27,850
and that is respect for the temporal gifts.

1323
02:44:28,030 --> 02:44:31,270
I think you've misunderstood an
essential point, dearest Henrietta.

1324
02:44:32,530 --> 02:44:35,820
But I suggest we postpone this
discussion to a more suitable time.

1325
02:44:35,950 --> 02:44:39,540
Forgive me, dear Emilie.
I am forgetting myself.

1326
02:44:39,870 --> 02:44:42,330
I'm sure you're a more
capable housewife than I.

1327
02:44:42,630 --> 02:44:44,740
I'll ask your advice in all things.

1328
02:44:45,130 --> 02:44:47,960
Edvard has admonished me a hundred times.

1329
02:44:49,380 --> 02:44:52,220
It's not easy to realize

1330
02:44:52,390 --> 02:44:55,300
one has become superfluous!

1331
02:44:55,430 --> 02:44:56,590
That will do, Henrietta.

1332
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:24,290
Perhaps I may be allowed to share

1333
02:45:24,590 --> 02:45:28,700
that we are early risers in this house,
both weekdays and Sundays.

1334
02:45:29,380 --> 02:45:32,620
At 6:00 we gather for morning
prayers in Edvard's study.

1335
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:37,420
I'd also like to mention that we make
our own beds and tidy our rooms.

1336
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:42,220
In this house, punctuality,
cleanliness and order are the rule.

1337
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:44,760
Don't be alarmed, children.

1338
02:45:44,940 --> 02:45:47,650
My daughter makes it sound
worse than it actually is.

1339
02:45:47,940 --> 02:45:49,680
We'll start out very gently.

1340
02:45:49,820 --> 02:45:52,150
I'm not sure I understand.

1341
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:55,020
If you mean to apply a new
method of upbringing --

1342
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:57,940
Not at all, dear Emilie.

1343
02:45:58,450 --> 02:46:01,870
I'm convinced that the children will soon realize

1344
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,960
how fun it is to perform
one's duties conscientiously.

1345
02:46:05,420 --> 02:46:08,200
It's all to be like a game.

1346
02:46:08,340 --> 02:46:11,880
My children don't care for that sort of game,

1347
02:46:12,010 --> 02:46:13,290
and neither do I.

1348
02:46:13,430 --> 02:46:15,340
Time will tell,
dear Emilie.

1349
02:46:20,520 --> 02:46:23,180
Let us bring our hands together
and thank God for this meal.

1350
02:46:25,310 --> 02:46:28,800
Thank you, dear lord,
for what we have received,

1351
02:46:28,940 --> 02:46:31,730
and may we with generous
hearts share our abundance

1352
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:33,900
with those who hunger and thirst.
Amen.

1353
02:46:35,660 --> 02:46:38,270
Justina, please show Fanny
and Alexander to the nursery.

1354
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:43,110
It's late and high time for
young people to go to rest.

1355
02:47:05,020 --> 02:47:09,060
They're coming now.
Into bed, both of you!

1356
02:47:16,610 --> 02:47:18,400
Now we'll say our prayers.

1357
02:47:22,950 --> 02:47:25,870
Thank you, God, for this day.
Please make me good.

1358
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:27,780
May your angel stay by me through the night.

1359
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:29,910
God bless papa and mama
and grandpapa and grand --

1360
02:47:30,040 --> 02:47:31,530
And uncle Edvard.

1361
02:47:32,590 --> 02:47:33,870
And uncle Edvard,

1362
02:47:34,090 --> 02:47:36,750
myself and my brothers and sisters
and cousins, uncles and aunts,

1363
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:39,970
Vega, ester, Maj, Siri, Berta, Alida, Lisen,

1364
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:42,340
and uncle Isak and everybody else.
Amen.

1365
02:47:46,060 --> 02:47:47,520
Good night, Alexander.

1366
02:47:48,190 --> 02:47:51,600
Justina, I'd like to speak
to you about tomorrow.

1367
02:48:00,950 --> 02:48:03,320
What's that book you're reading, Alexander?

1368
02:48:17,340 --> 02:48:20,580
What's that book you're reading, Alexander?

1369
02:48:29,230 --> 02:48:31,180
Good night, my boy.

1370
02:48:47,450 --> 02:48:49,410
Good night, my child.
God bless you.

1371
02:48:50,370 --> 02:48:51,910
Good night,
uncle Edvard.

1372
02:48:59,550 --> 02:49:02,710
My dearest wish is for us to
live at peace with one another.

1373
02:49:06,970 --> 02:49:08,970
Love cannot be commanded,

1374
02:49:10,480 --> 02:49:12,810
but we can show respect and consideration.

1375
02:49:18,070 --> 02:49:20,100
You go ahead, my dear.
I'll come later.

1376
02:49:30,330 --> 02:49:31,950
Whose doll house is this?

1377
02:49:32,750 --> 02:49:35,830
Fifteen years ago,
two little girls lived in this room.

1378
02:49:36,500 --> 02:49:39,210
They drowned in the river with their mother.

1379
02:49:40,010 --> 02:49:44,220
- Perhaps the house is haunted.
- There are no such things as ghosts.

1380
02:49:46,350 --> 02:49:49,430
- Did they live in this room?
- I think this was the nursery.

1381
02:49:49,730 --> 02:49:51,470
Good night. Sleep well.

1382
02:49:51,890 --> 02:49:54,260
I think we've got a terrible stepfather.

1383
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:56,680
And the sister is crazy.

1384
02:49:56,820 --> 02:49:59,730
And that tub of lard that has to be fed.

1385
02:49:59,860 --> 02:50:01,230
I don't want to live here.

1386
02:50:12,370 --> 02:50:14,530
You have to give me time.

1387
02:50:15,210 --> 02:50:17,040
Much has to be changed.

1388
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:21,290
Some things will go quickly,
others will take time.

1389
02:50:22,220 --> 02:50:24,550
The main thing is not to lose heart.

1390
02:50:24,890 --> 02:50:27,170
Why did you marry the Bishop?

1391
02:50:27,550 --> 02:50:31,170
Because I love him.

1392
02:50:32,020 --> 02:50:36,730
Now let us sleep. Things will seem
better when we're not so tired.

1393
02:50:42,990 --> 02:50:45,400
Don't play Hamlet,
my son.

1394
02:50:45,950 --> 02:50:47,730
I'm not queen Gertrude,

1395
02:50:47,910 --> 02:50:50,270
your kind stepfather isn't the king of Denmark,

1396
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:52,370
and this is not Ellsinore castle,

1397
02:50:52,750 --> 02:50:55,110
even if it does look rather gloomy.

1398
02:51:06,130 --> 02:51:08,420
Hell and damnation.

1399
02:51:12,430 --> 02:51:14,220
Come, Fanny.
I'll show you something.

1400
02:51:25,780 --> 02:51:27,770
The windows are barred.

1401
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:30,200
They can't be opened.

1402
02:54:57,740 --> 02:55:00,860
THE FOURTH ACT

1403
02:55:01,950 --> 02:55:06,910
EVENTS OF SUMMER

1404
02:56:20,200 --> 02:56:22,990
Is that you, old Isak?

1405
02:56:23,410 --> 02:56:25,120
How nice of you to call.

1406
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:29,540
No, you're not disturbing me.
I was just sitting with my eyes closed.

1407
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,660
Sleeping?
You know I never sleep.

1408
02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:37,800
Everyone's abandoned me.

1409
02:56:37,970 --> 02:56:40,800
It's the annual excursion to the outer cliffs.

1410
02:56:41,510 --> 02:56:45,220
Gustav Adolf doesn't change plans,
even if it's raining cats and dogs.

1411
02:56:46,680 --> 02:56:50,180
When they left at 10:00,
the weather was fine,

1412
02:56:50,350 --> 02:56:52,720
but clouds have gathered over the mainland.

1413
02:56:53,860 --> 02:56:55,770
There's not a soul here.

1414
02:56:57,440 --> 02:57:00,860
Won't you come out here for once?

1415
02:57:02,410 --> 02:57:04,770
Come now,
don't be so stubborn.

1416
02:57:05,200 --> 02:57:07,780
You can't sit in your awful
shop the whole summer.

1417
02:57:09,710 --> 02:57:11,450
You want me to come to you?

1418
02:57:11,580 --> 02:57:15,540
I've sat here three days with a sprained ankle.

1419
02:57:16,630 --> 02:57:19,790
I was playing hopscotch with Jenny,
so I've only myself to blame.

1420
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:22,540
I'm not complaining.
I'm very comfortable.

1421
02:57:24,300 --> 02:57:25,920
What did you say?

1422
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:28,970
There's such static on the line,
I can't hear what you're saying.

1423
02:57:29,560 --> 02:57:33,350
It's thundering somewhere,
but it doesn't seem to be coming this way.

1424
02:57:35,650 --> 02:57:38,810
Yes, exactly, my friend.

1425
02:57:39,900 --> 02:57:43,240
Actually I'm very worried.

1426
02:57:45,030 --> 02:57:46,990
No, we haven't heard anything.

1427
02:57:47,120 --> 02:57:50,240
Emilie only told us she'd be
staying in town all summer.

1428
02:57:51,790 --> 02:57:53,950
This isn't good, Isak.

1429
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:57,580
I feel sick when I think of that
big house with its thick walls.

1430
02:57:57,750 --> 02:57:59,750
It's no place for children in the summer.

1431
02:58:02,340 --> 02:58:04,960
I can't hear a word you're saying.

1432
02:58:10,930 --> 02:58:12,670
It's hopeless.

1433
02:58:13,480 --> 02:58:18,060
Isak, can you hear me?
You sound very far away.

1434
02:58:19,110 --> 02:58:23,350
I'm going to hang up now.
I'll call you back in an hour.

1435
02:58:35,460 --> 02:58:38,620
I wonder if it isn't time for a little cognac.

1436
02:58:39,340 --> 02:58:40,870
Yes, I think it is.

1437
02:58:42,170 --> 02:58:45,510
- Good day, Mrs. Ekdahl.
- Why, it's Maj! How nice.

1438
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:47,180
Come in, dear child.

1439
02:58:51,980 --> 02:58:53,390
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

1440
02:58:53,640 --> 02:58:56,680
Not at all.
Give me a kiss.

1441
02:58:57,650 --> 02:58:59,260
That's nice.

1442
02:59:00,480 --> 02:59:03,650
Very pretty.
Did you make it yourself?

1443
02:59:03,780 --> 02:59:04,980
Yes.

1444
02:59:05,320 --> 02:59:07,190
A pretty pattern.

1445
02:59:08,580 --> 02:59:10,240
So you didn't go on the excursion?

1446
02:59:10,370 --> 02:59:12,610
No, I wouldn't fit in the boat with my big belly.

1447
02:59:12,750 --> 02:59:14,490
Nonsense.

1448
02:59:15,870 --> 02:59:19,160
- Is something wrong?
- I'm silly to worry.

1449
02:59:19,670 --> 02:59:21,460
Let's sit here.

1450
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:26,010
You're worried about the children?

1451
02:59:27,930 --> 02:59:30,760
Alexander and I agreed to write.

1452
02:59:31,180 --> 02:59:32,970
I've written seven letters.

1453
02:59:33,390 --> 02:59:35,010
And you've received no reply?

1454
02:59:35,190 --> 02:59:37,180
One postcard three weeks ago.

1455
02:59:38,860 --> 02:59:41,020
"Dear Maj. We are well.

1456
02:59:41,400 --> 02:59:45,110
Uncle Edvard took us to..."

1457
02:59:45,240 --> 02:59:46,690
the botanical gardens.

1458
02:59:46,820 --> 02:59:52,280
"We learned about rare flowers."

1459
02:59:53,540 --> 02:59:57,280
"Thank you for your letters.
I'll write when I get some time.

1460
02:59:57,830 --> 03:00:00,290
Love from Alexander.

1461
03:00:00,880 --> 03:00:02,540
Fanny sends her love."

1462
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:13,420
We mustn't underestimate Emilie.

1463
03:00:13,680 --> 03:00:16,300
She's perfectly capable of
looking after her children.

1464
03:00:17,190 --> 03:00:19,640
We're worrying for no reason.

1465
03:00:20,190 --> 03:00:22,270
I came to the family before Fanny was born.

1466
03:00:22,400 --> 03:00:24,010
They're my children too.

1467
03:00:24,150 --> 03:00:25,480
You're going already?

1468
03:00:25,610 --> 03:00:29,070
I wanted to speak with you,
since I knew you were alone.

1469
03:00:29,200 --> 03:00:30,780
Stay a moment.

1470
03:00:30,910 --> 03:00:33,240
Thank you for your kindness,

1471
03:00:33,370 --> 03:00:36,080
but I promised to have dinner
ready when they came home.

1472
03:00:36,500 --> 03:00:38,830
I haven't put the steak in the oven yet.

1473
03:00:38,960 --> 03:00:42,450
Dear child,
are things that bad?

1474
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:44,250
Yes.

1475
03:00:44,920 --> 03:00:48,080
- Is it the cafe?
- That too.

1476
03:00:49,090 --> 03:00:51,460
Has Gustav Adolf been pestering you?

1477
03:00:52,430 --> 03:00:54,640
I don't want to hurt him.
He's so kind.

1478
03:00:56,890 --> 03:00:59,300
What worries me most is the children.

1479
03:01:03,230 --> 03:01:06,940
I'm sorry to be crying.
I'm behaving badly.

1480
03:01:07,690 --> 03:01:09,690
Forgive me.

1481
03:01:31,050 --> 03:01:32,340
Supper time.

1482
03:01:42,270 --> 03:01:44,310
Then you are to go straight to bed.

1483
03:01:46,360 --> 03:01:48,220
The tray can be left until tomorrow.

1484
03:01:51,700 --> 03:01:53,980
Mrs. Tander sent some cookies for you.

1485
03:01:54,620 --> 03:01:58,660
I'll be upset if miss Vergerus
finds out I gave these to you.

1486
03:01:58,790 --> 03:02:00,370
Hasn't mother returned?

1487
03:02:00,500 --> 03:02:03,490
No, your mother has not returned.

1488
03:02:03,630 --> 03:02:05,620
She said she'd be back this evening.

1489
03:02:06,250 --> 03:02:09,210
Oh, dear,
I don't know what to say.

1490
03:02:09,590 --> 03:02:11,710
Why do you keep sighing like that?

1491
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:16,180
I haven't been in this house long,
thank goodness...

1492
03:02:17,850 --> 03:02:21,140
but Mrs. Tander,
who's been here since the first wife,

1493
03:02:21,270 --> 03:02:23,130
could tell you a thing or two.

1494
03:02:24,020 --> 03:02:25,930
Would you like a cookie?

1495
03:02:29,110 --> 03:02:31,520
- Yes, thank you.
- What does Mrs. Tander say?

1496
03:02:32,320 --> 03:02:35,690
That it was the same in the first wife's day.

1497
03:02:37,830 --> 03:02:39,030
Only worse.

1498
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:45,780
- Poor children.
- You mean us?

1499
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,580
No, I don't mean you.

1500
03:02:51,170 --> 03:02:55,630
I mean the poor little ones who found
their grave in the dark river outside.

1501
03:02:57,550 --> 03:02:59,290
Their mother tried to save them,

1502
03:02:59,720 --> 03:03:01,760
but she was pulled down by the current.

1503
03:03:03,350 --> 03:03:05,720
They found them later by the bridge.

1504
03:03:08,400 --> 03:03:10,560
They clung tightly to each other

1505
03:03:10,690 --> 03:03:13,600
as if they were one big body.

1506
03:03:16,990 --> 03:03:20,700
The arms had to be sawn off to get
the bodies into separate coffins.

1507
03:03:22,250 --> 03:03:26,080
Mrs. Tander says that since then,
it has never been quiet in this house.

1508
03:03:26,420 --> 03:03:28,250
There are no ghosts.

1509
03:03:28,540 --> 03:03:31,410
I don't mean to frighten you...

1510
03:03:33,670 --> 03:03:36,790
but this house does funny things to you.

1511
03:03:37,470 --> 03:03:38,920
Look at my hand.

1512
03:03:39,390 --> 03:03:43,430
Skin's been completely ripped off,
stripped down to the flesh.

1513
03:03:46,890 --> 03:03:49,310
I was taking his grace his coffee.

1514
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:53,430
When I grabbed the doorknob,
the skin stuck and ripped off.

1515
03:03:56,030 --> 03:03:58,610
Someone laughed behind me.

1516
03:03:59,620 --> 03:04:02,150
I heard it clearly and turned around.

1517
03:04:05,580 --> 03:04:08,120
But there was no one there.

1518
03:04:10,630 --> 03:04:12,540
I feel sorry for anyone who --

1519
03:04:13,960 --> 03:04:16,300
I shouldn't chatter on like this.

1520
03:04:16,840 --> 03:04:18,380
I'll keep quiet.

1521
03:04:19,970 --> 03:04:21,550
I'll close the door now.

1522
03:04:27,980 --> 03:04:29,640
Don't worry.

1523
03:04:30,610 --> 03:04:32,520
Your mother will probably be back tomorrow,

1524
03:04:32,650 --> 03:04:37,480
and his grace will personally
release you from captivity.

1525
03:04:39,530 --> 03:04:42,270
- I've seen them.
- Who?

1526
03:04:42,910 --> 03:04:44,450
The woman and the children.

1527
03:04:45,500 --> 03:04:47,030
Is that the truth?

1528
03:04:47,750 --> 03:04:50,030
Are you telling the truth, Alexander?

1529
03:04:50,170 --> 03:04:52,500
Word of honour as a Swedish citizen.

1530
03:04:52,630 --> 03:04:54,370
Where did you see them?

1531
03:04:54,670 --> 03:04:58,500
I had been in the library with that
man who married my mother.

1532
03:04:58,630 --> 03:05:00,500
He'd been lecturing me.

1533
03:05:01,640 --> 03:05:03,630
I don't remember why.

1534
03:05:05,180 --> 03:05:07,300
I was passing through the dining room...

1535
03:05:08,480 --> 03:05:10,970
and it was unusually bright.

1536
03:05:11,900 --> 03:05:15,260
Then I saw a little girl in the doorway.

1537
03:05:15,610 --> 03:05:19,100
She ran past me without a sound.

1538
03:05:20,990 --> 03:05:23,700
Then I saw the older girl,

1539
03:05:23,830 --> 03:05:26,940
with the dark hair and big eyes.

1540
03:05:29,540 --> 03:05:32,000
She stopped and looked at me

1541
03:05:32,130 --> 03:05:36,040
and motioned to me to turn around.

1542
03:05:38,710 --> 03:05:43,460
And there in the bright sunlight...

1543
03:05:44,680 --> 03:05:49,170
stood the woman in her black dress.

1544
03:05:52,400 --> 03:05:56,510
She said in a faint,
almost inaudible voice...

1545
03:05:58,480 --> 03:06:00,100
not to be afraid,

1546
03:06:00,490 --> 03:06:02,270
that she had something to tell me.

1547
03:06:03,320 --> 03:06:04,730
What did she say?

1548
03:06:04,910 --> 03:06:06,900
I don't want to frighten anyone,

1549
03:06:07,830 --> 03:06:10,360
but these were her very words:

1550
03:06:13,290 --> 03:06:16,330
"I want you to know our secret.

1551
03:06:18,710 --> 03:06:22,170
Your stepfather,
my husband,

1552
03:06:23,220 --> 03:06:26,710
locked me and my children in the bedchamber.

1553
03:06:29,180 --> 03:06:33,180
For five days and nights

1554
03:06:33,810 --> 03:06:36,270
he kept us without food and water.

1555
03:06:38,610 --> 03:06:41,600
In our misery

1556
03:06:41,780 --> 03:06:43,360
we decided to escape.

1557
03:06:44,110 --> 03:06:48,950
We tied sheets together
and tried to climb down

1558
03:06:49,410 --> 03:06:54,030
to the finger of land sticking out into the deep,
swirling water.

1559
03:06:56,040 --> 03:06:58,450
My daughters went first,

1560
03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:02,080
but they fell headfirst into the water

1561
03:07:02,470 --> 03:07:04,670
and were dragged under.

1562
03:07:06,510 --> 03:07:08,250
I tried to save them

1563
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:13,550
but was sucked down into a black
whirlpool that grabbed my clothes.

1564
03:07:15,560 --> 03:07:19,400
Underwater I grasped my children's hands

1565
03:07:20,190 --> 03:07:22,650
and drew them to me."

1566
03:07:23,570 --> 03:07:24,980
That's devilish.

1567
03:07:26,860 --> 03:07:27,980
Get to bed.

1568
03:07:29,660 --> 03:07:31,200
I said get to bed.

1569
03:07:32,450 --> 03:07:33,860
What time is it?

1570
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,030
His grace has forbidden me to speak to you.

1571
03:07:37,120 --> 03:07:39,870
I'll be angry if you don't keep quiet.

1572
03:07:42,710 --> 03:07:45,170
Him and his stories!

1573
03:07:48,680 --> 03:07:50,170
Did you see that?

1574
03:07:53,720 --> 03:07:56,680
- The lightning struck.
- It was nearby.

1575
03:07:57,440 --> 03:07:59,600
I hope the damn cathedral went to hell.

1576
03:07:59,730 --> 03:08:02,770
What if God punishes you for saying that?

1577
03:08:03,030 --> 03:08:07,190
If a big know-it-all like him
punishes a runt like me for so little,

1578
03:08:07,740 --> 03:08:10,570
then he's just the dirty bastard I suspect he is.

1579
03:08:11,660 --> 03:08:13,950
Listen, he's playing the flute.

1580
03:08:14,750 --> 03:08:19,360
If we concentrate on him dying,
then he will.

1581
03:08:19,500 --> 03:08:21,490
But we have to start together.

1582
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:25,040
One, two, three:

1583
03:08:25,260 --> 03:08:27,370
Die, you devil!

1584
03:08:31,010 --> 03:08:34,050
- He's still playing.
- Let's try again.

1585
03:08:35,390 --> 03:08:37,300
One, two, three:

1586
03:08:38,020 --> 03:08:40,390
Die, you devil!

1587
03:08:58,830 --> 03:09:04,580
Mrs. Tander wants to know if your
grace will have supper alone.

1588
03:09:05,420 --> 03:09:07,880
Tell her I don't want any supper.

1589
03:09:08,010 --> 03:09:10,750
A glass of milk and a sandwich
in my room will be sufficient.

1590
03:09:10,930 --> 03:09:13,090
Thank you, sir.
I'll tell her.

1591
03:09:16,640 --> 03:09:18,100
Was there something else?

1592
03:09:19,440 --> 03:09:20,890
I don't know.

1593
03:09:23,440 --> 03:09:27,150
I don't know how to say it.
It's so unpleasant. It might seem --

1594
03:09:27,280 --> 03:09:28,640
Well?

1595
03:09:29,280 --> 03:09:31,440
Sir, I can't stand here in the doorway.

1596
03:09:33,070 --> 03:09:34,780
Come in, then,
and close the door.

1597
03:09:39,500 --> 03:09:42,330
You said I was to keep an eye on the children,

1598
03:09:43,130 --> 03:09:47,410
listen to their conversation and
tell you of anything unusual.

1599
03:09:47,550 --> 03:09:48,750
Well?

1600
03:09:50,220 --> 03:09:52,880
Alexander made up a terrible story.

1601
03:09:53,180 --> 03:09:54,380
Really?

1602
03:09:54,970 --> 03:09:56,430
It was about --

1603
03:09:57,640 --> 03:10:00,630
Oh, it's so awful I don't know how to get it out.

1604
03:10:04,060 --> 03:10:08,020
He says you locked your first wife up,

1605
03:10:08,150 --> 03:10:12,390
and she was drowned with her
children when they tried to escape.

1606
03:10:23,370 --> 03:10:26,830
- That's all, sir.
- You can go.

1607
03:12:18,910 --> 03:12:22,990
Yes, Oscar,
that's how it is.

1608
03:12:23,660 --> 03:12:27,030
One is old and a child at the same time.

1609
03:12:29,540 --> 03:12:33,540
What became of those long years in between

1610
03:12:34,460 --> 03:12:36,920
that seemed so important at the time?

1611
03:12:41,220 --> 03:12:43,840
I sit here growing melancholy,

1612
03:12:43,970 --> 03:12:47,510
thinking time was all too short.

1613
03:12:53,980 --> 03:12:56,980
Your father used to say I was sentimental.

1614
03:12:57,400 --> 03:13:00,610
He wasn't known as a
particularly sensitive man.

1615
03:13:01,740 --> 03:13:04,610
He was both angry and indignant when he died.

1616
03:13:07,160 --> 03:13:09,530
He never thought life was cruel

1617
03:13:10,040 --> 03:13:11,660
or unfair

1618
03:13:12,290 --> 03:13:13,660
or beautiful.

1619
03:13:15,380 --> 03:13:20,090
He just lived and didn't care to comment.
He left that to me.

1620
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:23,430
And when I went on about life,

1621
03:13:23,550 --> 03:13:26,590
he laughed and called me sentimental.

1622
03:13:30,940 --> 03:13:32,800
But I was an artist.

1623
03:13:34,110 --> 03:13:37,350
As an artist,
I had a right to be emotional.

1624
03:13:45,530 --> 03:13:47,740
Oscar, my dear boy.

1625
03:13:50,040 --> 03:13:52,580
I may be worrying for no reason,

1626
03:13:53,290 --> 03:13:55,530
but when you have nothing
to occupy your thoughts,

1627
03:13:55,710 --> 03:13:57,620
you immediately start worrying.

1628
03:14:06,310 --> 03:14:07,890
May I take your hand?

1629
03:14:13,770 --> 03:14:16,390
I remember your hand as a child.

1630
03:14:16,570 --> 03:14:20,230
It was small and firm and dry.

1631
03:14:23,450 --> 03:14:26,860
And your wrist was so awfully slender.

1632
03:14:30,500 --> 03:14:32,450
I enjoyed being a mother.

1633
03:14:32,870 --> 03:14:36,370
I enjoyed being an actress, too,
but I preferred being a mother.

1634
03:14:38,250 --> 03:14:40,790
I liked having a big belly,

1635
03:14:41,300 --> 03:14:44,260
and I didn't give two shakes
about the theatre then.

1636
03:14:48,470 --> 03:14:50,800
It's all acting anyway.

1637
03:14:51,230 --> 03:14:53,470
Some roles are nice,
others not so nice.

1638
03:14:54,770 --> 03:14:57,260
I played a mother.

1639
03:14:57,400 --> 03:14:59,560
I played Juliet and Margareta.

1640
03:15:00,690 --> 03:15:03,810
Then suddenly I played a
widow or a grandmother.

1641
03:15:04,490 --> 03:15:06,650
One role follows the other.

1642
03:15:08,080 --> 03:15:10,570
The thing is not to shrink from them.

1643
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:16,240
But what became of it all?

1644
03:15:17,580 --> 03:15:19,950
Can you tell me that,
my boy?

1645
03:15:23,340 --> 03:15:24,880
You're a good boy

1646
03:15:25,010 --> 03:15:30,500
to listen to your old mother's soliloquies,
as Isak calls them.

1647
03:15:35,140 --> 03:15:37,980
Yes, you're a good boy, Oscar...

1648
03:15:40,400 --> 03:15:42,860
and I grieved terribly when you passed away.

1649
03:15:46,490 --> 03:15:49,280
That was a strange role to play.

1650
03:15:50,530 --> 03:15:53,200
My feelings came from deep in my body.

1651
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:56,780
Even though I could control them...

1652
03:15:58,880 --> 03:16:03,670
they shattered reality,
if you know what I mean.

1653
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:10,500
Reality has remained broken ever since...

1654
03:16:11,680 --> 03:16:14,720
and, oddly enough,
it feels more real that way.

1655
03:16:18,270 --> 03:16:21,390
So I don't bother to mend it.

1656
03:16:22,360 --> 03:16:25,720
I just don't care anymore
if nothing makes sense.

1657
03:16:31,370 --> 03:16:33,650
Oscar, my dear boy?

1658
03:16:33,790 --> 03:16:36,240
- Yes, mama.
- Are you sad?

1659
03:16:37,620 --> 03:16:38,830
I'm worried.

1660
03:16:38,960 --> 03:16:40,870
About the children?

1661
03:16:46,590 --> 03:16:47,960
Yes.

1662
03:16:51,680 --> 03:16:54,290
Get up.
Your stepfather wants to talk to you.

1663
03:16:57,730 --> 03:17:00,060
Get dressed.
Your stepfather wants to talk to you.

1664
03:17:04,480 --> 03:17:05,560
Hurry up!

1665
03:17:12,070 --> 03:17:13,480
Who's there?

1666
03:17:14,540 --> 03:17:15,870
It's just me.

1667
03:17:30,590 --> 03:17:32,460
Alexander, my boy.

1668
03:17:34,180 --> 03:17:37,090
In the presence of your sister
and Justina you have accused me

1669
03:17:37,220 --> 03:17:39,260
of having murdered my wife and children.

1670
03:17:39,390 --> 03:17:40,380
What?

1671
03:17:41,560 --> 03:17:43,770
Justina, please repeat what you told me.

1672
03:17:45,440 --> 03:17:49,310
Alexander said he had seen
your first wife and children.

1673
03:17:50,030 --> 03:17:54,940
She spoke to him and said that the bishop

1674
03:17:55,080 --> 03:18:00,200
had locked them all up without food and water.

1675
03:18:00,830 --> 03:18:03,820
On the fifth day they tried to escape

1676
03:18:04,420 --> 03:18:06,630
but drowned in the attempt.

1677
03:18:08,130 --> 03:18:11,250
- Do you recognize the story?
- No.

1678
03:18:14,430 --> 03:18:18,800
- So Justina has given false testimony?
- She could have dreamt it.

1679
03:18:21,730 --> 03:18:25,060
Justina, are you prepared to confirm
your statement under oath?

1680
03:18:25,190 --> 03:18:26,550
Yes, your grace.

1681
03:18:26,820 --> 03:18:28,310
Good, Justina.

1682
03:18:28,480 --> 03:18:32,570
Fanny, did you hear Alexander's story?

1683
03:18:32,700 --> 03:18:33,650
No.

1684
03:18:39,410 --> 03:18:43,000
So you maintain that Justina

1685
03:18:43,790 --> 03:18:47,120
was either lying or dreaming?

1686
03:18:47,420 --> 03:18:48,410
Yes.

1687
03:18:55,890 --> 03:18:57,880
Please come here, Alexander.

1688
03:18:58,680 --> 03:19:01,800
Are you prepared to swear to it?

1689
03:19:01,930 --> 03:19:03,270
Of course.

1690
03:19:03,390 --> 03:19:05,730
It's a mortal sin to swear falsely.

1691
03:19:07,270 --> 03:19:10,760
It's called perjury and is severely punished.

1692
03:19:11,820 --> 03:19:13,060
Really?

1693
03:19:15,110 --> 03:19:17,650
Lay your hand on the bible and say after me:

1694
03:19:20,370 --> 03:19:22,030
"I, Alexander Ekdahl...

1695
03:19:24,500 --> 03:19:28,080
swear by holy writ and by the living God...

1696
03:19:32,210 --> 03:19:36,800
that all I have said,
say and will say...

1697
03:19:41,680 --> 03:19:44,340
is the whole truth and nothing but the truth."

1698
03:19:52,320 --> 03:19:54,180
Alexander, my boy.

1699
03:19:56,240 --> 03:19:58,150
You remember that the two of us

1700
03:19:58,740 --> 03:20:02,400
had an important conversation
about a year ago.

1701
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:04,490
It concerned certain moral questions.

1702
03:20:05,080 --> 03:20:07,200
It wasn't really a conversation.

1703
03:20:10,420 --> 03:20:11,910
What do you mean?

1704
03:20:12,050 --> 03:20:14,660
The bishop spoke and Alexander said nothing.

1705
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:19,380
And felt ashamed, perhaps,
on account of your lies.

1706
03:20:20,470 --> 03:20:22,430
I've grown wiser since then.

1707
03:20:23,970 --> 03:20:25,890
You mean you lie better.

1708
03:20:26,270 --> 03:20:27,510
More or less.

1709
03:20:35,940 --> 03:20:37,780
I don't know what you imagine.

1710
03:20:37,900 --> 03:20:43,950
Do you think you can besmirch another
person's honour with impunity?

1711
03:20:46,040 --> 03:20:48,280
Do you think you can lie

1712
03:20:48,420 --> 03:20:50,950
and get away with perjury
without consequence?

1713
03:20:54,800 --> 03:20:57,960
Do you think this is a game, Alexander?

1714
03:20:58,090 --> 03:21:01,550
Or a play in which the children
get to make up their lines?

1715
03:21:02,300 --> 03:21:06,720
I think the bishop hates Alexander.
That's what I think.

1716
03:21:09,390 --> 03:21:11,810
Oh, so that's what you think.

1717
03:21:14,650 --> 03:21:16,560
I'll tell you something

1718
03:21:17,820 --> 03:21:19,980
that may come as a surprise.

1719
03:21:22,280 --> 03:21:23,900
I don't hate you.

1720
03:21:26,790 --> 03:21:28,320
I love you.

1721
03:21:29,500 --> 03:21:34,490
But the love I feel for you

1722
03:21:35,420 --> 03:21:37,500
and your mother and sister

1723
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:39,960
is not blind and sloppy.

1724
03:21:40,680 --> 03:21:43,760
It is strong and harsh.

1725
03:21:48,180 --> 03:21:50,640
- Do you hear what I say?
- No.

1726
03:21:57,190 --> 03:21:59,020
You're hardening your heart.

1727
03:22:00,860 --> 03:22:03,320
Moreover, you misjudge the situation.

1728
03:22:04,700 --> 03:22:09,990
- I am much stronger than you are.
- I don't doubt it.

1729
03:22:10,120 --> 03:22:12,160
I mean stronger spiritually.

1730
03:22:13,630 --> 03:22:16,330
Because I have truth and justice

1731
03:22:16,460 --> 03:22:17,870
on my side.

1732
03:22:26,850 --> 03:22:30,760
I know you'll confess in a little while.

1733
03:22:31,270 --> 03:22:36,230
Your confession and punishment
will be a relief to you.

1734
03:22:38,820 --> 03:22:40,730
You're a wise little man, Alexander.

1735
03:22:40,860 --> 03:22:43,230
You realize that the game is up...

1736
03:22:44,410 --> 03:22:48,700
but you are proud and stubborn...

1737
03:22:50,620 --> 03:22:52,830
and of course you are ashamed.

1738
03:22:52,960 --> 03:22:55,070
I've forgotten what I'm to confess.

1739
03:22:55,920 --> 03:22:57,250
Have you now.

1740
03:22:58,040 --> 03:23:00,160
What does the bishop want
Alexander to confess?

1741
03:23:00,300 --> 03:23:02,630
You know I have means at my disposal.

1742
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:04,420
I didn't, but I do now.

1743
03:23:06,090 --> 03:23:08,590
In my childhood,
parents were not so soft-hearted.

1744
03:23:09,930 --> 03:23:12,720
They had the cane.
I have one too.

1745
03:23:12,850 --> 03:23:16,690
It's an ordinary carpet beater,
but it can dance a fine step!

1746
03:23:18,190 --> 03:23:22,780
If that didn't work, we had other
effective means, namely castor oil.

1747
03:23:22,940 --> 03:23:25,480
There you see the bottle and a glass.

1748
03:23:26,320 --> 03:23:30,280
A few mouthfuls of this and you're more docile.

1749
03:23:31,790 --> 03:23:36,830
If that didn't help,
there was a dark and cold cubby-hole

1750
03:23:37,790 --> 03:23:41,380
where you sat for a few hours until
the rats started sniffing at your face.

1751
03:23:42,920 --> 03:23:44,540
Why must I be punished?

1752
03:23:46,470 --> 03:23:48,800
That is obvious, my boy.

1753
03:23:49,800 --> 03:23:52,220
You have a weakness in your character.

1754
03:23:52,350 --> 03:23:54,180
You can't distinguish lies from truth.

1755
03:23:54,310 --> 03:23:59,300
So far they are just child's lies,
however dreadful they may be.

1756
03:24:01,440 --> 03:24:05,060
But soon you will be a grown man, Alexander,

1757
03:24:06,150 --> 03:24:09,190
and life punishes liars
ruthlessly and indiscriminately.

1758
03:24:12,160 --> 03:24:16,620
The punishment is to teach you

1759
03:24:16,750 --> 03:24:18,240
a love of truth.

1760
03:24:20,420 --> 03:24:24,660
I confess I made it up about
locking your wife and children in.

1761
03:24:26,840 --> 03:24:30,930
- Do you also confess to perjury?
- I suppose so.

1762
03:24:31,680 --> 03:24:36,010
Now you've won a great victory.

1763
03:24:38,350 --> 03:24:40,310
A victory over yourself.

1764
03:24:47,200 --> 03:24:48,810
Which punishment do you choose?

1765
03:24:48,950 --> 03:24:51,690
Cane, castor oil or the dark cubby-hole?

1766
03:24:53,120 --> 03:24:55,730
- How many strokes of the cane?
- Ten.

1767
03:24:55,870 --> 03:24:57,490
Then I choose the cane.

1768
03:25:02,170 --> 03:25:05,710
Take two cushions and put them on the table.

1769
03:25:09,720 --> 03:25:11,710
Pull your pants down.

1770
03:25:16,390 --> 03:25:17,430
Bend over.

1771
03:25:55,760 --> 03:25:57,430
Stand up.

1772
03:25:58,600 --> 03:26:00,810
- You have something to say to me.
- No.

1773
03:26:02,400 --> 03:26:04,430
You must ask my forgiveness.

1774
03:26:05,150 --> 03:26:06,810
I won't.

1775
03:26:08,150 --> 03:26:10,860
Then I must cane you
until you think better of it.

1776
03:26:10,990 --> 03:26:13,690
Can't you spare us both
that unpleasant experience?

1777
03:26:13,820 --> 03:26:15,690
I'll never apologize.

1778
03:26:17,330 --> 03:26:20,290
You won't apologize?

1779
03:26:20,750 --> 03:26:21,700
No.

1780
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:24,660
Bend over.

1781
03:26:28,380 --> 03:26:29,790
No more, please!

1782
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:33,960
Will you ask forgiveness now?

1783
03:26:34,300 --> 03:26:35,290
Yes.

1784
03:26:37,470 --> 03:26:41,590
Button your pants and blow your nose.
Lend him a handkerchief, Justina.

1785
03:26:46,190 --> 03:26:48,980
What do you have to say now?

1786
03:26:51,280 --> 03:26:53,390
Alexander asks the bishop for forgiveness.

1787
03:26:53,530 --> 03:26:56,940
Speak up.
I want everyone to hear your regret.

1788
03:26:57,700 --> 03:27:00,320
Alexander asks the bishop for forgiveness.

1789
03:27:00,500 --> 03:27:02,580
For the lies and the perjury.

1790
03:27:07,460 --> 03:27:10,670
You do understand that I
punished you out of love?

1791
03:27:10,800 --> 03:27:12,160
Yes!

1792
03:27:13,680 --> 03:27:15,260
Kiss my hand, Alexander.

1793
03:27:16,010 --> 03:27:18,130
- May I go to bed now?
- Yes, you may.

1794
03:27:20,270 --> 03:27:26,180
But so that you may contemplate the
day's events in peace and quiet...

1795
03:27:27,440 --> 03:27:29,230
you're to sleep in the attic.

1796
03:27:29,770 --> 03:27:32,640
Justina will provide a mattress and a blanket.

1797
03:27:33,280 --> 03:27:38,190
At 6:00 in the morning you will be let out.
Understood?

1798
03:27:38,370 --> 03:27:39,980
Yes, your grace!

1799
03:27:57,340 --> 03:27:59,760
Helena, it's hardest on the children.

1800
03:28:01,890 --> 03:28:04,050
They're punished for the slightest misdeed.

1801
03:28:04,600 --> 03:28:08,590
His mother locks them up,
puts them to bed in the middle of the day.

1802
03:28:09,060 --> 03:28:11,900
A week ago,
Fanny refused to finish her porridge.

1803
03:28:13,230 --> 03:28:15,020
She had to sit there all night.

1804
03:28:15,360 --> 03:28:17,480
She threw up on the plate.
At last she finished it.

1805
03:28:19,780 --> 03:28:24,070
He's mad with jealousy but
doesn't realize it's mutual.

1806
03:28:24,790 --> 03:28:26,530
My poor Emilie.

1807
03:28:26,660 --> 03:28:28,750
How could I be so blind?

1808
03:28:30,380 --> 03:28:32,330
How could I feel compassion for that man?

1809
03:28:33,130 --> 03:28:36,420
I'm an actress.
I should have seen through his pretence.

1810
03:28:37,760 --> 03:28:40,670
But I had lived practically
alone since Fanny was born.

1811
03:28:42,060 --> 03:28:44,670
I hated my occasional emotional storms.

1812
03:28:49,060 --> 03:28:50,890
Oscar was my best friend.

1813
03:28:51,690 --> 03:28:53,350
You know that, Helena.

1814
03:28:54,940 --> 03:28:56,980
You know how fond I was of him,

1815
03:28:57,780 --> 03:28:59,390
how sincere my grief was

1816
03:28:59,530 --> 03:29:01,110
when he left us.

1817
03:29:01,740 --> 03:29:03,200
I don't blame you for anything.

1818
03:29:03,330 --> 03:29:05,690
I saw nothing,
understood nothing.

1819
03:29:07,210 --> 03:29:09,620
He spoke to me of another life.

1820
03:29:10,330 --> 03:29:11,910
A life of demands,

1821
03:29:12,420 --> 03:29:15,290
of purity,
of joy in the performance of duty.

1822
03:29:15,460 --> 03:29:17,250
I'd never heard such words.

1823
03:29:18,050 --> 03:29:21,010
There seemed to be a light
around him when he spoke to me.

1824
03:29:23,140 --> 03:29:26,800
At the same time,
I could tell he was lonely, unhappy...

1825
03:29:27,850 --> 03:29:29,930
haunted by fear and bad dreams.

1826
03:29:36,530 --> 03:29:38,980
He assured me I would save him.

1827
03:29:40,990 --> 03:29:44,950
He said together with the children
we'd live in nearness to God.

1828
03:29:46,330 --> 03:29:47,660
In the truth.

1829
03:29:50,460 --> 03:29:54,200
The truth
- that was the most important part.

1830
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:57,790
I was so thirsty.

1831
03:29:58,340 --> 03:30:00,800
I know it sounds dramatic
and overstrung, Helena...

1832
03:30:02,050 --> 03:30:06,220
but I thirsted for truth and
felt I'd been living a lie.

1833
03:30:07,770 --> 03:30:10,850
I must go.
A carriage is waiting at the gate.

1834
03:30:11,020 --> 03:30:13,010
I'm afraid something might have
happened while I've been here.

1835
03:30:14,150 --> 03:30:17,360
I'm in constant fear that Alexander
will say something to displease him.

1836
03:30:17,530 --> 03:30:20,190
Alexander is so foolhardy.
I've tried to warn him,

1837
03:30:20,360 --> 03:30:23,320
but he can't see that his stepfather
is a dangerous opponent

1838
03:30:23,450 --> 03:30:25,810
who's just waiting for the right
opportunity to crush him.

1839
03:30:25,950 --> 03:30:28,110
You must leave him, Emilie.

1840
03:30:29,580 --> 03:30:31,320
I'm pregnant.

1841
03:30:35,540 --> 03:30:37,120
Nevertheless, you must --

1842
03:30:37,250 --> 03:30:38,910
Forgive me for interrupting.

1843
03:30:40,050 --> 03:30:42,040
I've asked him for a divorce.

1844
03:30:43,260 --> 03:30:44,720
He refuses.

1845
03:30:46,050 --> 03:30:48,300
I tell him that I'll leave just the same.

1846
03:30:50,020 --> 03:30:53,130
Then he explains in detail what will happen.

1847
03:30:54,810 --> 03:30:58,730
In a court of law,
I'll lose on grounds of "desertion," as it's called.

1848
03:31:01,320 --> 03:31:04,900
The children will be taken from me,
to be brought up by him.

1849
03:31:11,540 --> 03:31:15,080
I've written in secret to a
friend of mine who's a lawyer.

1850
03:31:17,590 --> 03:31:20,330
He's confirmed what Edvard says.

1851
03:31:21,340 --> 03:31:23,050
I am shut in

1852
03:31:24,010 --> 03:31:26,250
and can no longer breathe.

1853
03:31:29,310 --> 03:31:30,970
I'm dying, Helena!

1854
03:31:34,060 --> 03:31:36,680
I hate that man so violently

1855
03:31:37,520 --> 03:31:38,980
that I could --

1856
03:31:51,040 --> 03:31:53,120
Don't mention that I've been here.

1857
03:31:54,080 --> 03:31:55,620
To anybody.

1858
03:32:41,090 --> 03:32:42,200
Mother.

1859
03:32:54,310 --> 03:32:55,260
Father.

1860
03:32:58,390 --> 03:33:00,230
If you're coming to visit...

1861
03:33:01,520 --> 03:33:03,680
please remember I'm scared of ghosts...

1862
03:33:05,030 --> 03:33:06,690
and that you're actually dead.

1863
03:33:11,030 --> 03:33:13,020
Don't sneak up on me from behind.

1864
03:33:16,830 --> 03:33:20,490
I might go mad from fear.
You wouldn't want that, right?

1865
03:33:25,960 --> 03:33:29,380
I don't understand why I always
have to see dead people

1866
03:33:30,050 --> 03:33:31,760
when it makes me sick.

1867
03:33:37,810 --> 03:33:39,390
Damn it!

1868
03:33:42,270 --> 03:33:43,890
Ah, hell!

1869
03:33:45,610 --> 03:33:47,100
My name's Pauline.

1870
03:33:48,190 --> 03:33:50,900
My sister Esmeralda is over by the crucifix.

1871
03:33:52,910 --> 03:33:55,360
- She's mad at you, Alexander.
- Why?

1872
03:33:55,490 --> 03:33:57,280
She wants us to punish you.

1873
03:33:59,500 --> 03:34:01,160
Why do you look so surprised?

1874
03:34:01,750 --> 03:34:04,790
- You know very well why we're mad.
- No, I don't.

1875
03:34:05,840 --> 03:34:08,040
You lied about our father.

1876
03:34:08,170 --> 03:34:11,080
You said he locked us up.
That's not true.

1877
03:34:13,050 --> 03:34:15,290
The floodgates had been
closed for several weeks,

1878
03:34:15,430 --> 03:34:17,170
and the river had frozen over.

1879
03:34:17,930 --> 03:34:20,050
We'd gotten new skates for Christmas.

1880
03:34:20,350 --> 03:34:23,090
But the ice broke,
and we fell into the water.

1881
03:34:24,230 --> 03:34:28,820
Mother tried to save us,
but the current dragged us under the ice.

1882
03:34:30,030 --> 03:34:32,310
Now you know the truth,
wretched boy.

1883
03:34:33,450 --> 03:34:36,240
My sister and I thought we'd free our father

1884
03:34:36,240 --> 03:34:37,940
from you and your hatred.

1885
03:34:38,490 --> 03:34:41,280
We'll scare the wits out of you
so you end up in the hospital,

1886
03:34:41,410 --> 03:34:43,700
locked in a cell,
chained hand and foot.

1887
03:34:43,830 --> 03:34:45,450
Please, don't frighten me!

1888
03:34:51,260 --> 03:34:53,500
- Give me the key!
- Edvard has forbidden it.

1889
03:34:53,630 --> 03:34:55,120
Give me the key now!

1890
03:34:55,300 --> 03:34:57,390
Edvard has forbidden it!

1891
03:34:59,390 --> 03:35:00,970
You're hurting me!

1892
03:35:07,110 --> 03:35:08,640
Emilie, you can't!

1893
03:36:00,450 --> 03:36:03,360
Carl, don't forget the cognac.

1894
03:36:03,540 --> 03:36:05,700
There's none left.

1895
03:36:15,970 --> 03:36:18,710
Take your damn paint box!

1896
03:36:23,560 --> 03:36:25,170
Listen to me.

1897
03:36:25,310 --> 03:36:28,890
I told you,
there's none left.

1898
03:36:32,400 --> 03:36:36,110
- Alma, we're to go up to see grandmama.
- What are you shouting about?

1899
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:38,860
I'm just shouting!

1900
03:36:40,370 --> 03:36:43,200
Punch will do just as well!

1901
03:36:56,220 --> 03:36:58,420
The old girl's not here.

1902
03:36:59,180 --> 03:37:01,010
She's probably in the dining room.

1903
03:37:01,890 --> 03:37:04,340
Good evening, mama.
We came to see how you are.

1904
03:37:04,470 --> 03:37:06,050
I'm splendid.

1905
03:37:06,180 --> 03:37:07,760
I hope you aren't lonely.

1906
03:37:08,020 --> 03:37:10,980
Lonely?
I love being alone.

1907
03:37:11,110 --> 03:37:13,060
Vega was bitten by a wasp.

1908
03:37:13,190 --> 03:37:15,430
A wasp stings, my dear.

1909
03:37:15,570 --> 03:37:17,600
It has a stinger just like your old man.

1910
03:37:17,780 --> 03:37:19,520
Don't pinch me.

1911
03:37:20,240 --> 03:37:22,610
And Petra fell in the lake and got soaked.

1912
03:37:22,740 --> 03:37:25,450
Where shall I serve supper?

1913
03:37:25,660 --> 03:37:27,280
I don't want any.

1914
03:37:27,410 --> 03:37:30,870
- How's the wasp sting?
- Not worth talking about.

1915
03:37:33,960 --> 03:37:36,120
And mama is busy with the
old man's photographs.

1916
03:37:36,260 --> 03:37:39,210
How many thousands have you sorted by now?

1917
03:37:39,510 --> 03:37:42,090
Here's one of you and your brothers.

1918
03:37:42,260 --> 03:37:44,470
You couldn't have been
more than five years old.

1919
03:37:44,640 --> 03:37:48,350
- You can already tell which brother...
- Who is this beautiful woman?

1920
03:37:48,480 --> 03:37:50,510
Did it rain on you the whole time?

1921
03:37:50,640 --> 03:37:52,600
No, not at all,
dearest mama.

1922
03:37:52,730 --> 03:37:54,890
Not a cloud over the outer islands,

1923
03:37:55,020 --> 03:37:58,020
but we saw the rain over the mainland,
and heard the thunder

1924
03:37:58,150 --> 03:37:59,640
it's rained all day here.

1925
03:37:59,780 --> 03:38:04,490
This woman with the low neckline
was one of papa's lady friends.

1926
03:38:04,870 --> 03:38:07,480
You're mistaken.
We were at school together.

1927
03:38:07,660 --> 03:38:11,370
She married a count,
had 12 children and became as big as a house.

1928
03:38:11,500 --> 03:38:16,540
I always admired your skilful way
of handling papa's little adventures.

1929
03:38:17,250 --> 03:38:18,660
We must be going.

1930
03:38:18,800 --> 03:38:22,130
Mr. Ohman and his lovely
wife are going to stop by.

1931
03:38:22,260 --> 03:38:25,170
I'm going into town tomorrow.
Anything I can do for you?

1932
03:38:25,300 --> 03:38:27,800
Thank you, Gusten.
I don't need anything.

1933
03:38:27,930 --> 03:38:30,590
But I'd like to talk to you about Maj.

1934
03:38:31,390 --> 03:38:34,010
What the hell is it now?
She's got it good.

1935
03:38:34,520 --> 03:38:37,180
Now I'm damned angry
- if you'll excuse me, mama.

1936
03:38:37,360 --> 03:38:38,810
Calm down, Gusten!

1937
03:38:43,070 --> 03:38:45,400
He loses his temper at the
mention of Maj's name.

1938
03:38:45,530 --> 03:38:47,110
I just want to say --

1939
03:38:47,240 --> 03:38:51,610
You have to realize Maj is
not your private plaything.

1940
03:38:52,120 --> 03:38:55,370
Thanks to alma's broad-mindedness,
she's a member of our family,

1941
03:38:55,540 --> 03:38:58,210
and she's expecting my grandchild.

1942
03:38:59,130 --> 03:39:02,670
In your dictatorial way,
you've decided her future.

1943
03:39:03,380 --> 03:39:04,620
I don't give a damn --

1944
03:39:04,760 --> 03:39:07,380
I don't like it when you swear
in your mother's presence.

1945
03:39:07,560 --> 03:39:09,550
You hear me, Gusten?

1946
03:39:20,070 --> 03:39:22,650
I like the girl.
I wish her well.

1947
03:39:23,360 --> 03:39:25,230
I want to ensure her future.

1948
03:39:25,360 --> 03:39:28,570
I don't want her to be dependent
on the family's benevolence if I die.

1949
03:39:28,700 --> 03:39:30,440
She's accepted my suggestions.

1950
03:39:30,580 --> 03:39:34,570
She doesn't need any protectors,
especially against me.

1951
03:39:34,750 --> 03:39:36,490
Stop your twaddle!

1952
03:39:38,130 --> 03:39:41,840
Don't make me out as a dictator!
Maj has decided it all herself!

1953
03:39:45,090 --> 03:39:46,420
I like her.

1954
03:39:48,390 --> 03:39:50,750
I'm kind to her.
Alma's kind to her.

1955
03:39:50,930 --> 03:39:54,260
Now I'm hurt, let me tell you.
Damned hurt!

1956
03:39:56,770 --> 03:39:59,760
There's no reason to side with Maj against me!

1957
03:40:04,950 --> 03:40:07,560
I'm fond of her.
Alma's fond of her.

1958
03:40:07,700 --> 03:40:10,570
She is loved in the same way as Jenny,
Petra and Putte.

1959
03:40:10,700 --> 03:40:14,110
Well, not exactly in the same way,
but almost.

1960
03:40:18,040 --> 03:40:19,580
She's good to me.

1961
03:40:19,840 --> 03:40:22,250
She doesn't think I'm fat
and old and disgusting.

1962
03:40:22,380 --> 03:40:24,870
Nobody thinks that,
by the --

1963
03:40:25,010 --> 03:40:28,300
I've a soft spot for the ladies.
What's to be done about it?

1964
03:40:28,970 --> 03:40:30,460
That's nothing to giggle at.

1965
03:40:30,760 --> 03:40:32,970
Maj is to go her own way through life,

1966
03:40:33,100 --> 03:40:35,090
and I'm going to give her
solid ground to stand on.

1967
03:40:35,230 --> 03:40:36,810
That's enough said about that.

1968
03:40:36,980 --> 03:40:40,890
The opera singer said he would stop by
with his wife and children. Come now.

1969
03:40:41,900 --> 03:40:44,480
Good-bye, mama.
Give me a kiss.

1970
03:40:46,150 --> 03:40:51,770
I don't want you and alma to sit
gossiping about Maj's future.

1971
03:40:52,370 --> 03:40:54,360
I'll see to that!

1972
03:40:54,950 --> 03:40:56,690
Or rather, she will.

1973
03:40:58,250 --> 03:40:59,830
Good night, mama.
Come, alma.

1974
03:41:00,000 --> 03:41:04,210
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Like hell you will! Come on!

1975
03:41:04,710 --> 03:41:07,830
Calm down or you'll have a stroke.

1976
03:41:08,010 --> 03:41:11,630
I am calm.
You're the one who's shouting.

1977
03:41:11,760 --> 03:41:15,000
I want an end to all that gossip
between you and mama!

1978
03:41:47,920 --> 03:41:51,510
Carlchen, you can't demand that I ask her.

1979
03:41:51,640 --> 03:41:56,380
Mama distrusts me and it's your fault.
Therefore I can't ask her.

1980
03:41:56,520 --> 03:41:59,220
I don't see how I can say anything.

1981
03:41:59,350 --> 03:42:02,890
- Tell her I'm desperate.
- You can tell her better yourself.

1982
03:42:03,060 --> 03:42:05,400
Make it clear I've been contemplating suicide.

1983
03:42:08,400 --> 03:42:10,230
Is that really true?

1984
03:42:13,410 --> 03:42:15,820
We can be poor together.

1985
03:42:16,700 --> 03:42:18,410
I will to work.

1986
03:42:20,620 --> 03:42:24,120
Idiot. Bonehead. Fool.

1987
03:42:24,250 --> 03:42:25,990
"I will work."

1988
03:42:26,090 --> 03:42:28,330
I'm sorry. I will work.

1989
03:42:30,090 --> 03:42:32,800
What do you want me to say,
mein Carlchen?

1990
03:42:32,890 --> 03:42:35,550
Don't you have any imagination,
you imbecile?

1991
03:42:36,310 --> 03:42:40,510
Say I look unhappy,
that I've stopped eating,

1992
03:42:40,850 --> 03:42:42,390
that I lie awake at night.

1993
03:42:42,520 --> 03:42:45,600
Yes, you do lie awake with insomnia.

1994
03:42:45,730 --> 03:42:47,440
It damn well is insomnia!

1995
03:42:48,360 --> 03:42:51,570
Say that I've grown quiet,
that I never laugh,

1996
03:42:51,700 --> 03:42:55,030
and when I do,
it sounds dreadful. Understand?

1997
03:42:56,370 --> 03:42:58,480
Don't just come right out with it,
damn it.

1998
03:42:59,500 --> 03:43:02,780
Lead her to suspect I've spoken of suicide.

1999
03:43:02,920 --> 03:43:07,530
Don't say that terrible word,
or I'll start crying.

2000
03:43:07,670 --> 03:43:09,500
Stupid slut.

2001
03:43:11,590 --> 03:43:13,550
Do you think of suicide,
mein Schatz?

2002
03:43:13,800 --> 03:43:15,590
Only when I look at you.

2003
03:43:16,140 --> 03:43:18,720
Why are you so cruel?

2004
03:43:21,480 --> 03:43:23,470
Don't go, Goddamn it!

2005
03:43:25,310 --> 03:43:26,850
Where are you going?

2006
03:43:28,320 --> 03:43:29,900
Why the hell are you leaving?

2007
03:43:30,030 --> 03:43:32,270
I won't talk to your mother.

2008
03:43:32,490 --> 03:43:34,820
I'm going home.
Du bist bose.

2009
03:43:35,740 --> 03:43:37,320
I have to cry.

2010
03:43:38,780 --> 03:43:41,150
You don't understand that I love you.

2011
03:43:42,000 --> 03:43:45,490
Now I'm crying,
and I won't be able to stop.

2012
03:43:45,750 --> 03:43:47,580
Dear God, my creator,

2013
03:43:47,710 --> 03:43:52,630
why must I go on acting in this wretched farce?

2014
03:43:52,760 --> 03:43:54,120
Lydia, stop!

2015
03:44:00,760 --> 03:44:03,010
Let me help you.

2016
03:44:03,560 --> 03:44:05,050
Oh, Goddamn it!

2017
03:44:05,270 --> 03:44:07,390
Just look at this.

2018
03:44:13,110 --> 03:44:14,520
Pick up your shawl.

2019
03:44:15,030 --> 03:44:17,310
Damn it all! My leg!

2020
03:44:31,920 --> 03:44:32,880
Grandma.

2021
03:44:37,590 --> 03:44:41,880
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- We sneaked out.

2022
03:44:42,720 --> 03:44:44,380
What will your mother say?

2023
03:44:44,560 --> 03:44:47,270
She won't find out.
Unless grandma tattles, of course.

2024
03:44:47,390 --> 03:44:49,480
What do you want from your old grandma?

2025
03:45:10,170 --> 03:45:11,700
Welcome home, Emilie.

2026
03:45:13,250 --> 03:45:14,830
You were gone a long time.

2027
03:45:18,180 --> 03:45:20,290
We almost began to worry.

2028
03:45:23,760 --> 03:45:25,970
Mrs. Tander wonders if
you'd like something to eat.

2029
03:45:26,100 --> 03:45:27,590
I'm not hungry.

2030
03:45:29,390 --> 03:45:30,980
I'll let her know.

2031
03:45:33,900 --> 03:45:36,770
- Will you be coming to bed soon?
- When the children are asleep.

2032
03:45:40,070 --> 03:45:43,490
I'll be reading in the library.
Please don't be long.

2033
03:45:43,580 --> 03:45:44,780
Good night, children.

2034
03:45:52,500 --> 03:45:55,460
We had actually decided

2035
03:45:55,630 --> 03:45:57,290
Alexander would sleep in the attic tonight.

2036
03:45:57,460 --> 03:45:59,500
But I understand that decision has changed.

2037
03:45:59,630 --> 03:46:00,620
Yes, it has.

2038
03:46:02,680 --> 03:46:05,890
Very well.
Perhaps it's best.

2039
03:46:08,730 --> 03:46:11,060
- Good night, Fanny.
- Good night, uncle Edvard.

2040
03:46:11,650 --> 03:46:12,930
Good night, Alexander.

2041
03:46:17,230 --> 03:46:18,310
Is he asleep?

2042
03:46:18,490 --> 03:46:19,940
No, I'm not.

2043
03:46:20,070 --> 03:46:22,980
Then you can also answer me
when I bid you good night.

2044
03:46:23,120 --> 03:46:24,150
I can't.

2045
03:46:24,280 --> 03:46:28,740
You can't?
What nonsense is that?

2046
03:46:29,750 --> 03:46:32,530
Alexander doesn't wish
the bishop a good night.

2047
03:46:39,130 --> 03:46:41,340
You have a sense of humour.
I like that.

2048
03:47:25,970 --> 03:47:28,880
Well, did you see your
mother-in-law and relatives?

2049
03:47:30,390 --> 03:47:32,050
Was it a nice visit?

2050
03:47:33,810 --> 03:47:36,470
Did it rain?
It rained and thundered here all day.

2051
03:47:38,730 --> 03:47:41,850
Well, a little moisture's good,
at least for the farmers.

2052
03:47:45,160 --> 03:47:48,770
Alexander and I had a little
review this afternoon.

2053
03:47:50,080 --> 03:47:53,110
The usual:
He couldn't distinguish fantasy from reality.

2054
03:47:53,410 --> 03:47:55,700
But we clarified the concepts.

2055
03:47:57,750 --> 03:47:59,910
He's not stupid,
that Alexander.

2056
03:48:02,130 --> 03:48:04,250
He's not stupid,
but he's very unforgiving.

2057
03:48:06,680 --> 03:48:10,640
"Alexander doesn't wish
the bishop a good night."

2058
03:48:12,140 --> 03:48:14,100
That's really priceless.

2059
03:48:19,360 --> 03:48:21,770
You're not saying anything.
Are you mad about something?

2060
03:48:21,940 --> 03:48:23,400
You locked up the children.

2061
03:48:25,280 --> 03:48:29,490
A safety measure, Emilie.
I wanted to guarantee you would return.

2062
03:48:29,620 --> 03:48:31,280
You abused Alexander.

2063
03:48:32,790 --> 03:48:35,570
You're so dramatic.

2064
03:48:35,710 --> 03:48:37,790
I punished him.

2065
03:48:38,960 --> 03:48:40,950
That's my duty as his guardian.

2066
03:48:41,090 --> 03:48:43,830
Besides, the punishment was
mild in comparison to the offence.

2067
03:48:44,670 --> 03:48:47,130
He's bleeding,
and the skin is broken.

2068
03:48:47,220 --> 03:48:48,960
I gave him a few lashes.

2069
03:48:49,470 --> 03:48:52,800
His buttocks will sting for a few days,
but it's a healthy sting.

2070
03:48:53,140 --> 03:48:56,680
He'll think twice before fabricating new lies,

2071
03:48:56,940 --> 03:49:00,300
or fantasies,
if that's the term you prefer.

2072
03:49:00,440 --> 03:49:01,770
And the humiliation?

2073
03:49:02,820 --> 03:49:07,360
Punishment given out of love
can never be humiliating

2074
03:49:07,490 --> 03:49:09,150
in the deeper sense.

2075
03:49:10,410 --> 03:49:12,360
Love and respect have nothing in common,

2076
03:49:12,620 --> 03:49:14,650
and the language of love...

2077
03:49:15,790 --> 03:49:17,820
can be rather harsh.

2078
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:19,490
You're one to speak of love.

2079
03:49:25,090 --> 03:49:27,170
You allow yourself to be contemptuous.

2080
03:49:31,140 --> 03:49:33,500
Shall we end this conversation

2081
03:49:33,680 --> 03:49:34,840
and go to bed?

2082
03:49:35,020 --> 03:49:36,430
You locked him in the attic.

2083
03:49:36,560 --> 03:49:39,170
Of course.
He needed to be alone.

2084
03:49:39,350 --> 03:49:40,640
You know he's afraid of the dark.

2085
03:49:40,770 --> 03:49:43,510
The nights are bright this time of year,

2086
03:49:43,650 --> 03:49:46,190
and those with a clear
conscience have nothing to fear.

2087
03:49:51,870 --> 03:49:53,860
I could kill you.

2088
03:50:00,040 --> 03:50:02,370
You'll harm the baby with thoughts like that.

2089
03:50:04,590 --> 03:50:06,870
Our baby will never be born.

2090
03:50:09,130 --> 03:50:12,250
Be careful of what you say.

2091
03:50:14,810 --> 03:50:16,550
You don't frighten me.

2092
03:50:20,890 --> 03:50:23,060
I must frighten you, Emilie.

2093
03:50:24,060 --> 03:50:26,730
But I do so with a heavy heart,

2094
03:50:26,900 --> 03:50:29,390
since I love you in spite of everything.

2095
03:50:31,610 --> 03:50:33,900
You're not strong, Emilie.

2096
03:50:34,030 --> 03:50:36,150
The pregnancy is draining your strength.

2097
03:50:37,700 --> 03:50:39,160
From now on you'll stay in a room

2098
03:50:39,290 --> 03:50:41,200
that we'll make as comfortable as possible.

2099
03:50:42,080 --> 03:50:44,410
Henrietta and my mother will
take turns looking after you.

2100
03:50:45,460 --> 03:50:48,200
For the time being,
your freedom will be somewhat limited.

2101
03:50:49,510 --> 03:50:53,000
But we must be very careful.

2102
03:50:59,390 --> 03:51:02,930
You should also know that
the slightest attempt to rebel

2103
03:51:03,350 --> 03:51:05,590
or contact the outside world

2104
03:51:05,730 --> 03:51:08,720
will affect your children's welfare.

2105
03:51:11,700 --> 03:51:16,280
By being irresponsible,
you've forced me to take responsibility,

2106
03:51:16,410 --> 03:51:18,620
not only for your children,
but also for you.

2107
03:51:19,620 --> 03:51:21,110
It's a heavy burden.

2108
03:51:22,460 --> 03:51:25,160
I feel a terrible loneliness.

2109
03:51:29,250 --> 03:51:31,290
I'm an ordinary man with great faults,

2110
03:51:32,130 --> 03:51:34,710
but I exercise a powerful office

2111
03:51:35,470 --> 03:51:37,550
that always overshadows the person holding it.

2112
03:51:37,680 --> 03:51:42,800
A man becomes a slave to such an office,
with no right to opinions of his own.

2113
03:55:11,100 --> 03:55:14,760
THE FIFTH ACT

2114
03:55:16,770 --> 03:55:20,610
DEMONS

2115
03:57:19,900 --> 03:57:22,100
Good day, Mr. Jacobi.

2116
03:57:22,900 --> 03:57:24,510
Good day,
Miss Vergerus.

2117
03:57:24,730 --> 03:57:25,890
What is it?

2118
03:57:26,110 --> 03:57:28,190
Is His Grace --

2119
03:57:28,530 --> 03:57:30,400
He is not to be disturbed.

2120
03:57:30,910 --> 03:57:33,070
May I speak to his wife?

2121
03:57:33,280 --> 03:57:35,570
She is indisposed,
resting in her room --

2122
03:57:35,750 --> 03:57:37,110
And not to be disturbed.

2123
03:57:37,250 --> 03:57:39,330
My mother is out and I am busy.

2124
03:57:39,460 --> 03:57:42,570
His Grace might be annoyed if --

2125
03:57:42,750 --> 03:57:44,410
What is this concerning?

2126
03:57:45,170 --> 03:57:50,420
Some months ago,
His Grace proposed a business deal.

2127
03:57:51,720 --> 03:57:54,260
Really? I don't recall.

2128
03:57:54,430 --> 03:57:56,220
Of course not,
miss Vergerus.

2129
03:57:56,350 --> 03:58:00,220
His grace is careful to spare
his family such trivial worries.

2130
03:58:00,350 --> 03:58:02,890
What worries of his could concern you?

2131
03:58:03,770 --> 03:58:05,980
Please don't force me to be vulgar.

2132
03:58:06,440 --> 03:58:10,230
To be candid, Mr. Jacobi,
I find you unpleasant.

2133
03:58:10,530 --> 03:58:13,320
I've neither the time nor the
inclination to speak with you.

2134
03:58:13,830 --> 03:58:16,530
- Good-bye, Mr. Jacobi.
- A pecuniary predicament.

2135
03:58:17,910 --> 03:58:19,150
I beg your pardon?

2136
03:58:19,290 --> 03:58:23,410
Your brother, His Grace,
was in a pecuniary predicament.

2137
03:58:23,540 --> 03:58:26,540
- May I sit down?
- Not there! There.

2138
03:58:27,300 --> 03:58:29,460
In a peculiar way
- I don't know why -

2139
03:58:29,970 --> 03:58:31,920
I appreciate your straightforwardness.

2140
03:58:32,720 --> 03:58:35,510
And I do not appreciate your fawning.

2141
03:58:36,760 --> 03:58:39,550
What business do you have with my brother?

2142
03:58:40,230 --> 03:58:42,090
None at all,
as far as I know.

2143
03:58:42,440 --> 03:58:44,220
I'm tired of your riddles.

2144
03:58:44,360 --> 03:58:46,060
Tell me what's on your mind and go.

2145
03:58:46,190 --> 03:58:50,020
I must speak to His Grace first.
It's a matter of money.

2146
03:58:50,990 --> 03:58:52,650
A lot of money.

2147
03:58:53,620 --> 03:58:55,480
Does my brother owe you money?

2148
03:58:55,700 --> 03:58:59,240
On the contrary.
It's like this:

2149
03:58:59,750 --> 03:59:02,110
In November His Grace
wanted to borrow money.

2150
03:59:02,250 --> 03:59:06,410
Regrettably, Jews have certain principles,
like never lending money to the clergy.

2151
03:59:06,540 --> 03:59:11,660
He suggested I should buy that
chest for a reasonable sum.

2152
03:59:11,970 --> 03:59:13,380
I declined.

2153
03:59:13,890 --> 03:59:15,800
So you declined.

2154
03:59:16,180 --> 03:59:19,670
Foolishly so,
since I've now changed my mind.

2155
03:59:19,810 --> 03:59:24,640
I'd like to buy that chest,
and at almost any price.

2156
03:59:25,360 --> 03:59:26,600
Almost.

2157
03:59:29,440 --> 03:59:31,230
I will get my brother.

2158
03:59:39,870 --> 03:59:42,200
I told you not to disturb me.

2159
03:59:42,330 --> 03:59:44,620
Mr. Jacobi wants to buy the chest.

2160
03:59:44,750 --> 03:59:46,830
That man hangs on like vermin!

2161
04:00:05,400 --> 04:00:08,310
Stay where you are.
I'll come get you in a few minutes.

2162
04:00:08,440 --> 04:00:10,100
Take your shoes off.

2163
04:00:17,700 --> 04:00:22,570
Forgive an old man's unfortunate weakness,
your grace.

2164
04:00:25,330 --> 04:00:28,490
- You wish to buy the chest?
- Yes.

2165
04:00:28,750 --> 04:00:30,410
For how much?

2166
04:00:30,670 --> 04:00:32,460
Here is the sum.

2167
04:00:40,430 --> 04:00:42,590
It seems you've changed your mind.

2168
04:00:42,770 --> 04:00:44,760
I may have an interested buyer.

2169
04:00:48,270 --> 04:00:52,730
- I'm being cheated, of course.
- You're free to say no.

2170
04:00:53,900 --> 04:00:56,360
- Do you have you the money with you?
- The money?

2171
04:00:56,610 --> 04:00:59,600
The money!
Of course, your grace.

2172
04:00:59,780 --> 04:01:01,650
I have large bills right here.

2173
04:01:02,240 --> 04:01:03,950
Let me see.

2174
04:01:05,660 --> 04:01:09,370
Yes, here they are.

2175
04:01:11,540 --> 04:01:14,290
- Give me the money.
- Of course.

2176
04:01:15,170 --> 04:01:19,210
If I may have your grace's
name on the contract?

2177
04:01:22,430 --> 04:01:24,670
Forgive me if I retire.

2178
04:01:24,810 --> 04:01:26,970
I shall miss you,
miss Vergerus.

2179
04:01:27,140 --> 04:01:30,230
Do not take anything that is not your due.

2180
04:01:31,270 --> 04:01:34,390
Suspicions recoil on those who harbour them.

2181
04:02:21,030 --> 04:02:25,150
Your grace will want to ensure that
I'm not taking more than my due.

2182
04:02:25,280 --> 04:02:26,690
That's quite all right.

2183
04:02:26,870 --> 04:02:30,780
I just wanted to return the signed contract.

2184
04:02:31,580 --> 04:02:33,200
Please have a seat.

2185
04:02:33,960 --> 04:02:36,790
What would you say about that painting?

2186
04:02:37,300 --> 04:02:39,080
A beautiful and valuable work.

2187
04:02:39,220 --> 04:02:41,250
Would it interest you?

2188
04:02:41,380 --> 04:02:44,170
My resources are regrettably
a bit strained at present.

2189
04:02:45,760 --> 04:02:48,850
- How is your wife?
- It's kind of you to inquire.

2190
04:02:49,390 --> 04:02:53,310
She is indisposed.
This sudden heat disagrees with her.

2191
04:02:53,810 --> 04:02:57,270
- May I pay my respects?
- Unfortunately not.

2192
04:02:57,570 --> 04:02:58,900
I understand.

2193
04:02:59,070 --> 04:03:01,860
Here is a letter for her from old Mrs. Ekdahl.

2194
04:03:02,910 --> 04:03:05,270
- I shall give it to her.
- You're too kind.

2195
04:03:05,410 --> 04:03:09,450
Filthy Jewish swine!
You damned, filthy Jewish swine!

2196
04:03:09,580 --> 04:03:11,440
You thought you could cheat me.

2197
04:03:11,580 --> 04:03:17,540
You'll regret this, you repulsive,
hook-nosed bastard!

2198
04:03:18,130 --> 04:03:19,340
Calm down!

2199
04:03:19,460 --> 04:03:21,750
That swine is trying to steal my children!

2200
04:03:21,880 --> 04:03:25,130
He can't.
I have the key to the nursery.

2201
04:03:47,530 --> 04:03:49,240
Don't touch them!

2202
04:04:09,930 --> 04:04:11,470
Come on, quickly!

2203
04:05:00,230 --> 04:05:01,690
Come here.

2204
04:05:03,690 --> 04:05:05,930
First and foremost,
let's have something to eat.

2205
04:05:07,990 --> 04:05:09,650
This is my nephew, Aron.

2206
04:05:12,620 --> 04:05:14,110
Let's go to the table.

2207
04:05:16,870 --> 04:05:18,530
I'd like to sleep.

2208
04:05:22,040 --> 04:05:23,910
Our guests are tired.

2209
04:05:24,880 --> 04:05:27,870
Have you tidied the room and made the beds?

2210
04:05:28,010 --> 04:05:30,220
I've done all you asked, uncle.

2211
04:05:52,740 --> 04:05:55,910
This is Aron's puppet theatre.

2212
04:05:57,500 --> 04:06:00,410
If you ask him nicely,
he may give a performance.

2213
04:06:11,260 --> 04:06:15,420
Behind this door lives my nephew Ismael.
He's sick.

2214
04:06:16,140 --> 04:06:20,680
The door must always be kept shut.
Remember that, both of you.

2215
04:06:21,400 --> 04:06:23,850
Sometimes he sings,
even at night.

2216
04:06:24,650 --> 04:06:28,190
It's nothing to worry about.
You'll get used to it.

2217
04:06:30,110 --> 04:06:33,820
Mind the steps, Fanny,
so you don't trip.

2218
04:06:34,580 --> 04:06:36,360
Now down this hallway.

2219
04:06:36,490 --> 04:06:38,530
It's a bit cold and damp,

2220
04:06:38,660 --> 04:06:42,250
because we don't dare light
a fire or open the windows.

2221
04:06:42,920 --> 04:06:45,530
Straight ahead,

2222
04:06:45,670 --> 04:06:48,790
and then through that little door.

2223
04:06:49,470 --> 04:06:50,960
It's not so unusual.

2224
04:06:53,640 --> 04:06:56,170
This will be your home for the time being.

2225
04:06:56,310 --> 04:06:57,970
I hope you'll like it.

2226
04:06:58,270 --> 04:06:59,800
Go to bed now.

2227
04:07:00,390 --> 04:07:01,850
Good night, Fanny.

2228
04:07:02,690 --> 04:07:04,140
Good night, Alexander.

2229
04:07:05,480 --> 04:07:08,520
Lock the door at night and
don't open it for anyone.

2230
04:07:09,530 --> 04:07:11,770
- Don't forget to say your prayers.
- Don't go.

2231
04:07:13,660 --> 04:07:16,400
You want me to stay?
Then I'll sit here.

2232
04:07:23,290 --> 04:07:25,030
I'll go and see to Ismael.

2233
04:07:30,300 --> 04:07:33,380
My name is Aron.
Ismael is my brother.

2234
04:07:33,510 --> 04:07:35,470
Our parents died when we were small.

2235
04:07:38,010 --> 04:07:39,220
Good night.

2236
04:07:50,570 --> 04:07:52,310
What kind of book is that?

2237
04:07:52,440 --> 04:07:58,060
It's a book of stories, thoughts,
words of wisdom and prayers.

2238
04:07:59,700 --> 04:08:01,360
It's written in Hebrew.

2239
04:08:01,540 --> 04:08:02,950
You understand that language?

2240
04:08:07,130 --> 04:08:09,160
- Shall I read you something?
- Yes, please.

2241
04:08:09,460 --> 04:08:11,040
Uncle Isak?

2242
04:08:12,550 --> 04:08:15,420
Are you sure His Grace can't come and get us?

2243
04:08:15,930 --> 04:08:18,040
You can put your mind at ease.

2244
04:08:18,220 --> 04:08:19,380
Come on, read.

2245
04:08:19,560 --> 04:08:22,260
It may be a bit choppy,
since I have to translate.

2246
04:08:26,100 --> 04:08:30,270
A young man journeys down an endless road

2247
04:08:30,400 --> 04:08:32,690
in the company of many others.

2248
04:08:34,900 --> 04:08:39,490
The road leads across a rocky
plain where nothing grows.

2249
04:08:41,490 --> 04:08:44,830
The sun's fire burns from morning to evening.

2250
04:08:45,410 --> 04:08:49,450
They can't find shade or coolness anywhere.

2251
04:08:51,090 --> 04:08:55,420
A harrowing wind stirs up huge dust clouds.

2252
04:08:58,260 --> 04:09:02,800
The youth is driven forward by
an incomprehensible anxiety...

2253
04:09:04,270 --> 04:09:07,010
and tormented by a scorching thirst.

2254
04:09:09,980 --> 04:09:13,560
Sometimes he asks himself or
one of his travelling companions

2255
04:09:14,320 --> 04:09:16,860
about the goal of their pilgrimage.

2256
04:09:18,660 --> 04:09:21,770
But the answer is uncertain and tentative.

2257
04:09:24,120 --> 04:09:29,830
He himself has forgotten why
he ever set out on his journey.

2258
04:09:31,920 --> 04:09:34,540
He's also forgotten his native land...

2259
04:09:36,010 --> 04:09:38,370
and the journey's final destination.

2260
04:09:41,390 --> 04:09:44,930
Suddenly, one evening he finds
himself standing in a forest.

2261
04:09:46,430 --> 04:09:48,470
Dusk sets in and all is quiet.

2262
04:09:48,600 --> 04:09:51,940
Perhaps the evening wind
sighs through the tall trees.

2263
04:09:54,190 --> 04:09:56,230
He stands amazed...

2264
04:09:57,490 --> 04:09:59,730
but also anxious and suspicious.

2265
04:10:01,820 --> 04:10:03,310
He's all alone...

2266
04:10:04,870 --> 04:10:07,080
and he discovers his hearing is weak,

2267
04:10:08,330 --> 04:10:13,420
since his ears are inflamed
from the merciless light of day.

2268
04:10:15,460 --> 04:10:19,080
His mouth and throat are
parched from the long pilgrimage.

2269
04:10:21,140 --> 04:10:23,090
His lips are cracked,

2270
04:10:23,220 --> 04:10:27,130
pressed together around
curses and harsh words.

2271
04:10:30,020 --> 04:10:34,140
So he doesn't hear the ripple of flowing water

2272
04:10:35,940 --> 04:10:39,560
and doesn't notice its reflection in the dusk.

2273
04:10:42,070 --> 04:10:46,660
He stands deaf and blind
at the edge of the spring...

2274
04:10:48,450 --> 04:10:51,320
unaware of its existence.

2275
04:10:54,040 --> 04:10:57,710
Like a sleepwalker he wanders
unaware between the sparkling pools.

2276
04:10:59,470 --> 04:11:05,380
His blind skill is remarkable,
and soon he's back onto the road...

2277
04:11:06,600 --> 04:11:10,010
in the burning,
shadowless light.

2278
04:11:14,440 --> 04:11:18,730
One night by the camp fire
he's seated near an old man

2279
04:11:19,440 --> 04:11:22,810
who's telling some children
about the forests and springs.

2280
04:11:25,660 --> 04:11:28,650
The youth recalls what he's been through,

2281
04:11:29,700 --> 04:11:32,410
but faintly and indistinctly...

2282
04:11:33,920 --> 04:11:35,250
as in a dream.

2283
04:11:37,250 --> 04:11:40,960
He turns to the old man,
sceptical yet courteous, and asks,

2284
04:11:42,090 --> 04:11:44,330
"where does all this water come from?"

2285
04:11:46,100 --> 04:11:50,960
"It comes from a mountain whose
peak is covered by a mighty cloud."

2286
04:11:52,600 --> 04:11:54,760
"What kind of cloud?"
the youth asks.

2287
04:11:57,360 --> 04:11:59,100
The old man answers,

2288
04:12:01,030 --> 04:12:06,860
"every man carries within him hopes,
fears and longings.

2289
04:12:08,830 --> 04:12:13,200
Every man shouts out his
despair or bears it in his mind.

2290
04:12:15,210 --> 04:12:18,120
Some pray to a particular God.

2291
04:12:20,090 --> 04:12:23,170
Others address their cries to the void.

2292
04:12:26,220 --> 04:12:30,680
This despair, this hope...

2293
04:12:32,350 --> 04:12:35,890
this dream of deliverance,
all these cries, all these tears

2294
04:12:36,020 --> 04:12:39,180
are gathered over thousands
and thousands of years...

2295
04:12:40,860 --> 04:12:45,820
and condense into an immeasurable
cloud around a high mountain.

2296
04:12:48,410 --> 04:12:51,770
Out of the cloud rain flows
down the mountain...

2297
04:12:54,160 --> 04:12:59,330
forming the streams and rivers
that flow through the great forests.

2298
04:13:01,960 --> 04:13:06,000
That's how the springs are formed
where you can quench your thirst...

2299
04:13:07,550 --> 04:13:10,670
wash your badly burnt face...

2300
04:13:12,640 --> 04:13:15,470
cool your blistered feet.

2301
04:13:18,440 --> 04:13:23,020
Everybody has at some time heard of the
mountain, the cloud and the springs...

2302
04:13:25,190 --> 04:13:29,510
but most people anxiously
remain on the dusty road

2303
04:13:29,510 --> 04:13:31,360
in the blazing light."

2304
04:13:33,370 --> 04:13:37,700
"Why do they stay there?"
Asks the youth in great astonishment.

2305
04:13:40,040 --> 04:13:42,200
"I certainly don't know,"
replies the old man.

2306
04:13:44,380 --> 04:13:46,750
"Perhaps they've convinced
themselves and each other

2307
04:13:46,880 --> 04:13:49,970
that they'll reach their unknown
destination by evening."

2308
04:13:52,930 --> 04:13:57,140
"What unknown destination?"
Asks the young man.

2309
04:14:00,230 --> 04:14:02,270
The old man shrugs his shoulders.

2310
04:14:04,900 --> 04:14:08,060
"In all probability the
destination does not exist.

2311
04:14:09,570 --> 04:14:12,190
It's deception or imagination.

2312
04:14:15,240 --> 04:14:18,660
I myself am on my way to
the forests and the springs.

2313
04:14:21,080 --> 04:14:23,750
I was there once when I was young...

2314
04:14:25,420 --> 04:14:27,910
and now I'm trying to find my way back.

2315
04:14:30,470 --> 04:14:32,500
It's not easy,
let me tell you."

2316
04:14:37,100 --> 04:14:40,220
The next morning the youth
set out with the old man

2317
04:14:40,350 --> 04:14:46,140
to seek the mountain, the cloud,
the forests and the rippling springs.

2318
04:16:14,660 --> 04:16:16,520
Shall we have a seat?

2319
04:16:19,030 --> 04:16:21,120
- May I tempt you with a glass of sherry?
- No, thank you.

2320
04:16:21,240 --> 04:16:22,360
No.

2321
04:16:23,540 --> 04:16:27,250
- An almond cookie? My sister's specialty.
- No, thank you.

2322
04:16:28,000 --> 04:16:29,240
Not that either.

2323
04:16:39,260 --> 04:16:41,050
I want the children back.

2324
04:16:41,180 --> 04:16:44,050
This is a small town,
and tongues will soon be wagging.

2325
04:16:46,100 --> 04:16:50,970
I fear you've misunderstood
the reason for our visit.

2326
04:16:52,730 --> 04:16:56,070
We're here on behalf of the family

2327
04:16:56,200 --> 04:16:58,690
to ask that you set Emilie
and the children free.

2328
04:17:00,030 --> 04:17:03,450
We can't say with certainty that
we know what has occurred.

2329
04:17:04,450 --> 04:17:07,370
We only know that our dear
Emilie is extremely unhappy

2330
04:17:08,000 --> 04:17:09,910
and that the children hate the Bishop's palace.

2331
04:17:10,090 --> 04:17:12,950
We certainly understand

2332
04:17:14,010 --> 04:17:17,370
that divorce is a painful step

2333
04:17:17,510 --> 04:17:20,340
for a highly placed servant of the church,

2334
04:17:21,600 --> 04:17:24,460
and we'd like to make
appropriate compensation

2335
04:17:24,600 --> 04:17:26,340
for your painful loss.

2336
04:17:27,440 --> 04:17:29,300
I've spoken with my mother,

2337
04:17:29,440 --> 04:17:34,650
and we're ready to place a
considerable sum at your disposal,

2338
04:17:34,780 --> 04:17:38,110
which you may,
of course, use...

2339
04:17:40,620 --> 04:17:43,320
for charity, a foundation,

2340
04:17:43,950 --> 04:17:46,690
or some other purpose close to your heart.

2341
04:17:47,870 --> 04:17:53,330
We agree that everything must be
handled with utmost discretion,

2342
04:17:53,800 --> 04:17:58,130
and my mother is willing to take
Emilie and the children to Italy

2343
04:17:59,180 --> 04:18:01,260
and remain there for at least a year.

2344
04:18:02,970 --> 04:18:06,130
Let me first say that I fully appreciate

2345
04:18:06,730 --> 04:18:11,060
the respect and generosity the Ekdahls
extend to me in this difficult hour.

2346
04:18:12,020 --> 04:18:15,360
At the same time,
it's necessary, though painful,

2347
04:18:16,610 --> 04:18:18,650
for me to speak very clearly.

2348
04:18:20,530 --> 04:18:23,070
The children have been
abducted from their home.

2349
04:18:24,030 --> 04:18:27,490
They must unconditionally and without
delay be returned to their legal parents.

2350
04:18:27,620 --> 04:18:30,780
Every delay will cause all of us -

2351
04:18:31,330 --> 04:18:33,570
not least their mother -

2352
04:18:33,710 --> 04:18:35,580
unspeakable suffering.

2353
04:18:37,670 --> 04:18:40,840
When the children are returned,
I'll be prepared to listen

2354
04:18:41,010 --> 04:18:43,170
to any proposals the Ekdahl family may have.

2355
04:18:43,800 --> 04:18:46,510
But to avoid any further misunderstandings...

2356
04:18:47,810 --> 04:18:50,520
I must make it clear that a divorce...

2357
04:18:52,440 --> 04:18:54,720
is absolutely out of the question.

2358
04:18:56,020 --> 04:19:01,390
I'm very grateful for your
precise and clear standpoint.

2359
04:19:03,370 --> 04:19:06,980
But I'm obliged to mention
that the children will never...

2360
04:19:08,200 --> 04:19:12,540
be returned to the Bishop's palace
to be subjected to the suffering

2361
04:19:13,120 --> 04:19:15,040
that up till now has befallen them.

2362
04:19:15,790 --> 04:19:18,480
Perhaps I should add that on this point

2363
04:19:18,480 --> 04:19:21,160
the Ekdahls are in complete agreement.

2364
04:19:21,840 --> 04:19:24,170
The matter is therefore not open to discussion.

2365
04:19:25,350 --> 04:19:27,300
The children are part of our family,

2366
04:19:27,970 --> 04:19:31,010
and we therefore consider ourselves
responsible for their well-being...

2367
04:19:32,190 --> 04:19:33,550
and development.

2368
04:19:35,730 --> 04:19:37,220
It grieves me...

2369
04:19:38,690 --> 04:19:41,350
that the Ekdahl family should
be dictating conditions.

2370
04:19:42,740 --> 04:19:45,730
Especially since, as their stepfather,
I have the law on my side.

2371
04:19:47,080 --> 04:19:49,280
And furthermore,
as a representative of the church,

2372
04:19:50,330 --> 04:19:52,440
I have the moral advantage.

2373
04:19:55,080 --> 04:19:58,750
But we have the children,
my dear brother.

2374
04:19:59,300 --> 04:20:03,160
I'm glad you're able to laugh
in this awkward situation.

2375
04:20:07,140 --> 04:20:10,630
Perhaps legal proceedings and
police action will be unavoidable.

2376
04:20:10,770 --> 04:20:13,800
I doubt it,
my dear Edvard.

2377
04:20:14,690 --> 04:20:17,350
You'd rather shit in your
pants than suffer the disgrace

2378
04:20:17,480 --> 04:20:20,640
of the parish hags whistling
through their false teeth.

2379
04:20:20,940 --> 04:20:25,480
You may well have morality and
the law on your side, old man,

2380
04:20:25,610 --> 04:20:28,110
but bear in mind that I'm
in league with immorality,

2381
04:20:28,410 --> 04:20:30,820
and even were you to win in court,

2382
04:20:31,120 --> 04:20:32,830
we who side with immorality

2383
04:20:32,950 --> 04:20:37,290
will have spread so many credible
rumours about your person,

2384
04:20:37,580 --> 04:20:39,920
your way of life,
your household,

2385
04:20:40,050 --> 04:20:41,660
your sister,
your servants,

2386
04:20:41,800 --> 04:20:44,960
your sanity,
your sexual excesses,

2387
04:20:45,130 --> 04:20:48,590
your phoney hair, your hypocrisy,
your hypochondria,

2388
04:20:48,800 --> 04:20:53,050
and your lack of decency that
you'll be forever forced to preach

2389
04:20:53,430 --> 04:20:57,220
to Huguenots,
hooligans and Eskimos!

2390
04:20:57,980 --> 04:21:00,560
I'm not saying this to frighten you,
my esteemed friend.

2391
04:21:02,150 --> 04:21:04,730
I only wish to lay all the cards on the table.

2392
04:21:06,990 --> 04:21:09,230
So let me see you listen to reason.

2393
04:21:09,370 --> 04:21:10,980
If you have any, that is.

2394
04:21:13,120 --> 04:21:15,580
Your clownish antics are amusing.

2395
04:21:15,710 --> 04:21:18,320
I'd be inclined to laugh if
your babble didn't contain

2396
04:21:18,500 --> 04:21:21,910
what I would call a real and material threat.

2397
04:21:22,050 --> 04:21:24,960
Let me tell you something,

2398
04:21:25,170 --> 04:21:28,420
my fine lord Bishop,

2399
04:21:29,010 --> 04:21:30,750
something you might not understand.

2400
04:21:30,890 --> 04:21:33,380
I can see through you.

2401
04:21:33,810 --> 04:21:36,010
You're a cad of monumental proportions!

2402
04:21:36,180 --> 04:21:39,850
Shut up, Gustav Adolf!
Think of your blood pressure!

2403
04:21:43,530 --> 04:21:45,640
I must apologize,
my dear Edvard.

2404
04:21:46,280 --> 04:21:49,940
Even if we have differing views in what
seems to be an irresolvable conflict,

2405
04:21:50,070 --> 04:21:52,860
we must behave like civilized beings.

2406
04:21:54,410 --> 04:21:56,990
I disassociate myself entirely from
Gustav Adolf's expressions and attitudes

2407
04:21:57,120 --> 04:22:01,460
and assure you that he
represents no one but himself.

2408
04:22:02,090 --> 04:22:05,870
He certainly does not
voice the family's opinion.

2409
04:22:17,930 --> 04:22:20,220
My esteemed brother must forgive me.

2410
04:22:21,310 --> 04:22:22,890
A thousand apologies.

2411
04:22:23,060 --> 04:22:26,180
I'm a boor
- at least that's what my wife says.

2412
04:22:27,240 --> 04:22:30,570
I have no eye for people's inner qualities.

2413
04:22:32,070 --> 04:22:35,190
I drink too much.
I'm embarrassed. I apologize.

2414
04:22:35,330 --> 04:22:37,690
We'll say no more about it.

2415
04:22:38,370 --> 04:22:41,910
I'm prepared to listen to an
honest man's honest opinion,

2416
04:22:42,040 --> 04:22:44,580
even if he is a bit...

2417
04:22:45,380 --> 04:22:46,870
brusque.

2418
04:22:49,470 --> 04:22:52,670
A glass of sherry?
I assure you it's quite good.

2419
04:22:57,930 --> 04:22:59,260
Thank you very much.

2420
04:23:06,940 --> 04:23:08,350
I'm awfully sorry.

2421
04:23:09,940 --> 04:23:14,730
I'm so fond of that silly Emilie,
that silly little creature.

2422
04:23:15,530 --> 04:23:19,400
We love her. The whole family loves her.
Isn't that so, Carl?

2423
04:23:20,080 --> 04:23:24,290
And when our brother Oscar died,
we didn't care for her sufficiently.

2424
04:23:25,170 --> 04:23:27,630
We have much to blame ourselves for.

2425
04:23:29,300 --> 04:23:32,590
One can be so damned slack and self-centred.

2426
04:23:32,720 --> 04:23:34,460
I said that to Alma this morning.

2427
04:23:34,590 --> 04:23:37,130
If we hadn't been so slack and self-centred,

2428
04:23:37,260 --> 04:23:40,470
this would never have --

2429
04:23:52,490 --> 04:23:56,950
I don't think we can reach an agreement
under present circumstances.

2430
04:24:01,000 --> 04:24:06,330
Let us consider our confidential
and frank conversation

2431
04:24:06,500 --> 04:24:08,080
as a cautious exploration.

2432
04:24:08,340 --> 04:24:12,710
I fear I do not share your cautious optimism.

2433
04:24:15,550 --> 04:24:17,380
I consider our negotiations terminated...

2434
04:24:19,180 --> 04:24:23,170
and feel compelled to make
my standpoint quite clear.

2435
04:24:25,690 --> 04:24:28,350
The children must be returned
to their home within 12 hours.

2436
04:24:29,020 --> 04:24:32,440
Otherwise I'll be forced,
though it conflicts with my principles,

2437
04:24:33,700 --> 04:24:36,400
to report the matter to the
police and the public prosecutor.

2438
04:24:39,280 --> 04:24:42,650
Is it conceivable that if the
children were returned,

2439
04:24:43,870 --> 04:24:49,040
we could begin informal talks about
their future relations with us?

2440
04:24:49,210 --> 04:24:54,200
I'm a believer in firm rules and principles...

2441
04:24:56,010 --> 04:24:57,920
a fact that in no way conflicts

2442
04:24:58,050 --> 04:25:00,170
with my sincere and
passionate love of freedom.

2443
04:25:01,720 --> 04:25:04,720
May I understand your statement

2444
04:25:04,850 --> 04:25:09,060
as an indirect promise of future discussions

2445
04:25:09,230 --> 04:25:12,390
regarding the sensitive question
of Emilie's and the children's

2446
04:25:12,530 --> 04:25:14,060
freedom of movement?

2447
04:25:21,490 --> 04:25:23,400
Disintegration in our lives...

2448
04:25:26,040 --> 04:25:30,120
is due in large part to broken
ties between people...

2449
04:25:31,460 --> 04:25:35,750
who otherwise have the capacity
to respect and love each other.

2450
04:25:40,140 --> 04:25:42,500
A cruel and incomprehensible mystery.

2451
04:25:42,640 --> 04:25:44,250
To think that a man like me,

2452
04:25:44,390 --> 04:25:46,760
almost 220 pounds,

2453
04:25:46,890 --> 04:25:49,730
with a fully grown beard
and a developed mind...

2454
04:25:50,980 --> 04:25:54,060
should have to sit here on this silly,
uncomfortable chair

2455
04:25:54,190 --> 04:25:56,930
and listen to this unmitigated hypocrite.

2456
04:25:57,070 --> 04:25:59,650
"Disintegration in our lives!"

2457
04:25:59,780 --> 04:26:01,770
Kiss me where my back changes its name!

2458
04:26:01,950 --> 04:26:04,110
You shut up, Carl.
Shut up!

2459
04:26:04,290 --> 04:26:05,630
While I tell this spiritual masturbator

2460
04:26:05,630 --> 04:26:07,950
what we have up our sleeves.

2461
04:26:08,210 --> 04:26:09,490
Listen to me!

2462
04:26:10,120 --> 04:26:13,460
I'll tell you something,
Edvard Vergerus.

2463
04:26:14,960 --> 04:26:18,300
I've acquired your promissory notes.

2464
04:26:19,630 --> 04:26:21,300
You didn't know that,
did you?

2465
04:26:22,140 --> 04:26:23,380
Yes, my friend.

2466
04:26:24,470 --> 04:26:28,310
110,000 kronor in debts.

2467
04:26:30,060 --> 04:26:32,640
So I'll be dictating conditions now.

2468
04:26:34,650 --> 04:26:36,060
Turning pale now,
are you?

2469
04:26:37,150 --> 04:26:40,810
The holy man's looking pale, eh, Carl?

2470
04:26:41,530 --> 04:26:44,150
I'd say his nose even grew a bit too.

2471
04:26:48,660 --> 04:26:53,580
You're a special kind of bully,
Edvard Vergerus.

2472
04:26:53,710 --> 04:26:58,670
One thing I've learned in my profession
is to recognize the smell of a bully,

2473
04:26:59,340 --> 04:27:01,380
even if he wears a cassock.

2474
04:27:03,850 --> 04:27:06,090
And I know how bullies should be treated.

2475
04:27:06,510 --> 04:27:08,050
They must be bullied!

2476
04:27:08,180 --> 04:27:10,640
Emilie is to have her divorce,

2477
04:27:11,020 --> 04:27:14,930
or I'll declare his holiness bankrupt!

2478
04:27:42,470 --> 04:27:43,670
Idiot.

2479
04:27:43,800 --> 04:27:44,880
What?

2480
04:27:45,050 --> 04:27:47,510
I said idiot.
You're an idiot.

2481
04:27:48,310 --> 04:27:51,260
I thought it honourable to tell
him he doesn't have a chance.

2482
04:27:51,390 --> 04:27:53,850
I get so tired of you sometimes,
Gustav Adolf.

2483
04:27:54,230 --> 04:27:56,770
Really?
What stupid thing have I done now?

2484
04:27:57,360 --> 04:27:58,690
You'll soon see.

2485
04:27:59,900 --> 04:28:03,940
A moment ago we spoke of the advantage
of putting our cards on the table.

2486
04:28:05,660 --> 04:28:08,360
I beg to return to that metaphor shortly.

2487
04:28:09,200 --> 04:28:11,410
To Mr. Ekdahl I'd like to say...

2488
04:28:13,290 --> 04:28:15,030
that I pity him.

2489
04:28:16,750 --> 04:28:21,040
He has a poor opinion of the world
and a simplistic view of people.

2490
04:28:22,590 --> 04:28:24,630
He suffers from the widespread misconception

2491
04:28:24,720 --> 04:28:26,830
that man is ruled by his needs.

2492
04:28:27,720 --> 04:28:32,010
He believes that everything
can be bought and sold.

2493
04:28:35,060 --> 04:28:39,430
Mr. Ekdahl is the son of one of
the country's greatest artists.

2494
04:28:40,570 --> 04:28:44,480
Despite this he has grasped little or nothing...

2495
04:28:45,360 --> 04:28:48,700
of the spirit's unlimited power

2496
04:28:49,830 --> 04:28:51,280
over matter.

2497
04:28:54,750 --> 04:28:56,490
He is a wretched caliban,

2498
04:28:57,040 --> 04:28:59,780
groping with clumsy hands for his dull tools.

2499
04:29:00,210 --> 04:29:03,870
I pity him and feel sincere compassion for him.

2500
04:29:06,510 --> 04:29:10,470
My esteemed Carl, I thank you for a
respectful and dignified conversation.

2501
04:29:12,640 --> 04:29:14,800
I regret we have not come to an agreement.

2502
04:29:16,640 --> 04:29:19,310
Try sometime to tell your brother --

2503
04:29:22,280 --> 04:29:24,810
No, he would never understand...

2504
04:29:26,070 --> 04:29:29,150
that there are people who have no needs...

2505
04:29:30,320 --> 04:29:32,490
who are indifferent to money...

2506
04:29:34,080 --> 04:29:35,990
who dismiss the world's luxuries,

2507
04:29:36,160 --> 04:29:38,120
who happily allow themselves to be slandered

2508
04:29:38,250 --> 04:29:42,240
because their conscience is clear

2509
04:29:43,090 --> 04:29:45,170
before God the almighty.

2510
04:29:48,840 --> 04:29:53,710
Now, to return to our game of cards,
which Mr. Ekdahl spoke of so wittily.

2511
04:29:54,270 --> 04:29:59,010
Allow me to play the last card.

2512
04:30:00,020 --> 04:30:01,510
Excuse me for a moment.

2513
04:30:07,530 --> 04:30:11,570
That man is the devil himself!

2514
04:30:11,700 --> 04:30:14,530
Have you ever seen such
a cold-blooded scoundrel?

2515
04:30:14,660 --> 04:30:16,990
If you hadn't behaved like an idiot.

2516
04:30:17,120 --> 04:30:19,830
I admit it,
and I'm sick about it.

2517
04:30:19,960 --> 04:30:22,320
No, that's not the word.
I'm terribly sorry.

2518
04:30:22,460 --> 04:30:24,870
- Be quiet, he's coming. Shut up!
- I'll shut up.

2519
04:30:28,260 --> 04:30:30,040
Dear, dear Gustav Adolf.

2520
04:30:30,220 --> 04:30:31,380
Dear Carl.

2521
04:30:32,050 --> 04:30:35,590
I can't begin to express my
gratitude for your care and affection,

2522
04:30:36,100 --> 04:30:38,380
but unfortunately you've misunderstood.

2523
04:30:39,100 --> 04:30:42,180
Isak Jacobi took it upon
himself to abduct the children.

2524
04:30:42,980 --> 04:30:44,890
It's terrible and unbelievable.

2525
04:30:46,440 --> 04:30:48,430
It's nice and safe here.

2526
04:30:48,950 --> 04:30:51,780
Edvard is good to us,
and we're very happy.

2527
04:30:53,160 --> 04:30:55,360
I implore you with all my heart

2528
04:30:55,490 --> 04:30:57,070
to bring back my children.

2529
04:30:58,160 --> 04:31:00,240
It's true that I've been anxious and unhappy.

2530
04:31:01,000 --> 04:31:03,740
It's true that I went and talked to Helena.

2531
04:31:04,460 --> 04:31:08,200
It's true the children had difficulty
adjusting to their new surroundings.

2532
04:31:08,550 --> 04:31:12,210
It's true we live a stricter and
more serious life than at home.

2533
04:31:14,970 --> 04:31:16,590
But I'm happy and safe.

2534
04:31:17,270 --> 04:31:19,180
Edvard is goodness itself.

2535
04:31:21,020 --> 04:31:22,510
You must believe me.

2536
04:31:23,810 --> 04:31:26,050
I implore you with all my heart:

2537
04:31:27,400 --> 04:31:29,640
Bring back my children!

2538
04:31:30,150 --> 04:31:32,610
I cannot live without them!

2539
04:31:34,780 --> 04:31:38,530
Dear friends, do as I say.

2540
04:31:39,870 --> 04:31:43,110
It's all a terrible misunderstanding.

2541
04:31:56,390 --> 04:31:57,800
Farewell, gentlemen.

2542
04:32:04,480 --> 04:32:06,310
I have to pee.

2543
04:32:11,570 --> 04:32:13,810
Damn, there's no chamber pot.

2544
04:32:17,120 --> 04:32:19,730
It won't be easy to find the toilet in the dark.

2545
04:32:32,420 --> 04:32:34,510
I hope there aren't any ghosts.

2546
04:33:21,890 --> 04:33:24,300
Damn, I think I've lost my way.

2547
04:33:53,380 --> 04:33:56,250
Now I'm lost for sure.

2548
04:34:20,660 --> 04:34:23,820
It's not my fault it's all gone wrong.

2549
04:34:25,450 --> 04:34:28,990
I can't leave you.
I just can't.

2550
04:34:29,120 --> 04:34:31,830
It would be better if you'd take off for heaven.

2551
04:34:31,960 --> 04:34:33,620
You can't help us anyway.

2552
04:34:46,470 --> 04:34:51,060
I lived my whole life with
you children and Emilie.

2553
04:34:52,520 --> 04:34:54,680
Death makes no difference.

2554
04:34:59,780 --> 04:35:01,990
What is it, Alexander?

2555
04:35:03,530 --> 04:35:07,200
Why can't you go to God and
tell him to kill the Bishop?

2556
04:35:09,160 --> 04:35:13,250
Or doesn't God give a damn about you,
or any of us?

2557
04:35:15,130 --> 04:35:18,210
Have you even seen God on the other side?

2558
04:35:20,170 --> 04:35:23,460
Not a bastard has a thought in his head.

2559
04:35:25,810 --> 04:35:27,640
Idiots, the whole bunch of 'em.

2560
04:35:34,860 --> 04:35:38,390
You must be gentle with people.

2561
04:36:00,210 --> 04:36:02,050
Aren't you coming to bed?

2562
04:36:04,050 --> 04:36:06,040
The clock has struck 4:00.

2563
04:36:06,300 --> 04:36:07,840
I can't sleep.

2564
04:36:10,810 --> 04:36:12,170
Neither can I.

2565
04:36:12,310 --> 04:36:17,180
Elsa's very sick.
We ought to send for the doctor.

2566
04:36:17,310 --> 04:36:19,230
He's coming in the morning.

2567
04:36:19,400 --> 04:36:21,560
- What are you drinking?
- Hot broth.

2568
04:36:21,740 --> 04:36:23,900
- It helps against insomnia.
- May I?

2569
04:36:32,410 --> 04:36:33,870
Be my guest.

2570
04:36:35,080 --> 04:36:37,040
Can't you forgive me?

2571
04:36:37,540 --> 04:36:41,460
I'm staying with you,
aren't I?

2572
04:36:45,130 --> 04:36:47,590
I don't understand this sudden yielding.

2573
04:36:47,970 --> 04:36:49,760
Drink while it's hot.

2574
04:36:58,270 --> 04:37:01,310
- You insist that the children return?
- Yes.

2575
04:37:01,440 --> 04:37:03,430
In that case,
it's hopeless.

2576
04:37:03,570 --> 04:37:06,780
I don't care if it's hopeless.
I care only for what is right.

2577
04:37:08,030 --> 04:37:09,860
Isn't that Elsa calling?

2578
04:37:13,700 --> 04:37:16,620
Stay here. I'll see to her.

2579
04:37:31,390 --> 04:37:33,000
Can I help you, aunt?

2580
04:37:33,270 --> 04:37:35,010
It's so dark.

2581
04:38:04,880 --> 04:38:06,670
What time is it?

2582
04:38:08,130 --> 04:38:10,000
Almost half past 4:00.

2583
04:38:10,180 --> 04:38:11,590
It's been a long night.

2584
04:38:12,550 --> 04:38:14,420
Try to get some sleep.

2585
04:38:14,720 --> 04:38:16,510
My legs hurt.

2586
04:38:18,350 --> 04:38:20,090
They're swollen and aching.

2587
04:38:32,950 --> 04:38:35,570
I've heard the universe is expanding.

2588
04:38:37,450 --> 04:38:40,660
Heavenly bodies are hurtling away
from each other at a bewildering rate.

2589
04:38:41,830 --> 04:38:44,000
The universe is exploding,

2590
04:38:44,130 --> 04:38:47,040
and we find ourselves at the
very moment of explosion.

2591
04:38:49,430 --> 04:38:54,720
You once said you were
always changing masks...

2592
04:38:56,470 --> 04:38:58,760
until finally you didn't know who you were.

2593
04:39:03,110 --> 04:39:05,810
I have only one mask.

2594
04:39:07,320 --> 04:39:10,060
But it's branded into my flesh.

2595
04:39:14,870 --> 04:39:16,950
If I tried to tear it off --

2596
04:39:27,340 --> 04:39:29,700
I always thought people liked me.

2597
04:39:32,930 --> 04:39:35,960
I saw myself as wise,
broad-minded and fair.

2598
04:39:38,180 --> 04:39:39,920
I had no idea...

2599
04:39:41,770 --> 04:39:44,510
that anyone could hate me.

2600
04:39:45,440 --> 04:39:47,100
I don't hate you.

2601
04:39:49,400 --> 04:39:51,980
No, but your son does.

2602
04:39:56,120 --> 04:39:57,610
I'm afraid of him.

2603
04:40:24,600 --> 04:40:26,310
Who's behind the door?

2604
04:40:27,480 --> 04:40:29,940
It is God behind the door.

2605
04:40:33,240 --> 04:40:37,980
- Can't you come out?
- No living being may see God's face.

2606
04:40:40,660 --> 04:40:44,650
- What do you want?
- To prove that I exist.

2607
04:40:49,250 --> 04:40:50,620
This is the end of me.

2608
04:40:50,750 --> 04:40:54,750
Shall I show myself?

2609
04:40:54,880 --> 04:40:56,500
Now you will see me.

2610
04:40:57,850 --> 04:41:00,630
Here I come, Alexander.

2611
04:41:27,120 --> 04:41:30,120
- Admit you were scared.
- I wasn't a damned bit scared.

2612
04:41:31,710 --> 04:41:33,540
"This is the end of me."

2613
04:41:37,630 --> 04:41:39,340
Ouch! That hurts.

2614
04:41:40,390 --> 04:41:41,880
Don't cry.

2615
04:41:42,890 --> 04:41:46,550
I didn't mean to scare you.
At least not that much.

2616
04:41:52,570 --> 04:41:54,980
I've been working all night on this puppet.

2617
04:41:56,610 --> 04:42:00,650
A rich circus owner in England
is mad about our puppets.

2618
04:42:01,410 --> 04:42:03,620
I heard you tiptoeing around.

2619
04:42:06,250 --> 04:42:09,410
Hear that?
My brother Ismael is awake.

2620
04:42:10,380 --> 04:42:11,620
He's singing.

2621
04:42:19,300 --> 04:42:20,760
Poor Ismael.

2622
04:42:21,010 --> 04:42:23,170
Human beings are more than he can bear.

2623
04:42:23,680 --> 04:42:26,090
Sometimes he gets furious.
Then he's dangerous.

2624
04:42:27,270 --> 04:42:30,430
Doctors say his intelligence
is light-years beyond normal.

2625
04:42:31,610 --> 04:42:33,190
He reads continuously.

2626
04:42:33,320 --> 04:42:36,100
He's incredibly learned and
knows everything by heart.

2627
04:42:36,360 --> 04:42:40,770
You said you'd been up all night,
but I saw you asleep.

2628
04:42:40,910 --> 04:42:43,490
There are many strange
things that can't be explained.

2629
04:42:44,280 --> 04:42:46,620
You realize that when you dabble in magic.

2630
04:42:47,750 --> 04:42:50,450
- Have you seen our mummy?
- No.

2631
04:42:51,830 --> 04:42:52,910
Come.

2632
04:43:38,630 --> 04:43:40,500
Look carefully, Alexander.

2633
04:43:41,680 --> 04:43:43,790
Can you see it breathing?

2634
04:43:44,680 --> 04:43:48,300
It's been dead 4,000 years,
but it breathes.

2635
04:43:50,020 --> 04:43:52,010
I'll make the room dark.

2636
04:43:58,440 --> 04:44:00,680
- What do you see?
- It's shining.

2637
04:44:01,360 --> 04:44:02,770
Exactly.

2638
04:44:03,820 --> 04:44:06,230
No one knows why it's luminous.

2639
04:44:07,530 --> 04:44:09,320
No one can explain why.

2640
04:44:11,710 --> 04:44:14,620
The unknown makes people angry.

2641
04:44:15,460 --> 04:44:18,870
It's better to blame it on mirrors,
machines and projections.

2642
04:44:19,340 --> 04:44:20,830
Then people laugh,

2643
04:44:21,210 --> 04:44:23,810
and that's healthier from all viewpoints,

2644
04:44:23,810 --> 04:44:24,800
especially financially.

2645
04:44:26,220 --> 04:44:27,760
Watch carefully now.

2646
04:44:56,630 --> 04:45:00,410
My father and mother ran a
magic theatre in St. Petersburg.

2647
04:45:01,460 --> 04:45:04,250
One evening,
in the middle of a performance...

2648
04:45:05,470 --> 04:45:07,080
a real ghost appeared.

2649
04:45:08,800 --> 04:45:12,260
It was my father's aunt,
who had died two days earlier.

2650
04:45:13,480 --> 04:45:17,090
The ghost lost her way among
the machines and projectors.

2651
04:45:18,110 --> 04:45:21,520
It was a fiasco,
and father had to refund the tickets.

2652
04:45:22,940 --> 04:45:25,610
- I know quite a bit about ghosts.
- Do you?

2653
04:45:27,280 --> 04:45:30,440
Uncle Isak says we're
surrounded by different realities,

2654
04:45:30,580 --> 04:45:32,190
one on top of the other.

2655
04:45:33,040 --> 04:45:35,780
There are swarms of ghosts, spirits, phantoms,

2656
04:45:36,460 --> 04:45:39,290
souls, poltergeists,
angels and demons.

2657
04:45:41,290 --> 04:45:44,630
He says the smallest
pebble has a life of its own.

2658
04:45:45,340 --> 04:45:47,300
- More coffee?
- Yes, please.

2659
04:45:49,050 --> 04:45:50,790
Everything is alive,

2660
04:45:51,470 --> 04:45:53,800
and everything is God or God's thought.

2661
04:45:54,310 --> 04:45:56,840
Not only good things,
but the cruellest too.

2662
04:45:58,480 --> 04:46:00,090
What do you think?

2663
04:46:01,270 --> 04:46:02,730
If there is a God,

2664
04:46:02,940 --> 04:46:06,100
then he's a shit,
and I'd like to kick him in the butt.

2665
04:46:06,240 --> 04:46:08,600
Your theory is very interesting

2666
04:46:08,740 --> 04:46:11,530
and appears to be justified.

2667
04:46:12,870 --> 04:46:14,820
Shall we take Ismael his breakfast?

2668
04:46:18,920 --> 04:46:20,910
For my part,
I'm an atheist.

2669
04:46:21,540 --> 04:46:25,460
If you've been raised as a magician and
learned all the tricks since childhood,

2670
04:46:25,590 --> 04:46:27,920
then you can do without
supernatural interference.

2671
04:46:28,470 --> 04:46:31,330
As a magician,
I create the believable.

2672
04:46:31,470 --> 04:46:34,260
The audience provides the unbelievable.

2673
04:46:42,860 --> 04:46:46,690
You're definitely no idiot, Alexander,
especially considering you're only nine.

2674
04:46:47,110 --> 04:46:49,070
- I'll be eleven in November.
- Here.

2675
04:46:58,040 --> 04:46:59,870
I've brought your breakfast.

2676
04:47:16,010 --> 04:47:19,720
Your sister gave me sleeping
pills for my insomnia.

2677
04:47:20,730 --> 04:47:22,890
I had put three in the broth.

2678
04:47:23,060 --> 04:47:25,900
I didn't mean for you to drink it.

2679
04:47:26,650 --> 04:47:31,060
When you went to see Elsa,
I put in three more.

2680
04:47:34,870 --> 04:47:36,820
You will sleep soundly.

2681
04:47:39,660 --> 04:47:41,700
When you wake up,
I will be gone.

2682
04:47:43,420 --> 04:47:45,450
I'm going back to my children...

2683
04:47:47,000 --> 04:47:48,410
to my home...

2684
04:47:50,590 --> 04:47:52,210
and my family.

2685
04:48:14,950 --> 04:48:17,780
I'll change and you'll come back.

2686
04:48:18,290 --> 04:48:20,490
I'll never come back!

2687
04:48:20,620 --> 04:48:22,610
I'll poison your life!

2688
04:48:22,750 --> 04:48:24,410
I'll follow you from town to town!

2689
04:48:24,540 --> 04:48:26,530
I'll ruin your children's future!

2690
04:48:26,670 --> 04:48:29,630
Poor Edvard,
you don't know what you're saying!

2691
04:48:29,800 --> 04:48:31,290
I am awake!

2692
04:48:32,220 --> 04:48:34,250
I'm horribly awake.

2693
04:48:39,140 --> 04:48:41,800
Help me into bed at least.

2694
04:48:43,640 --> 04:48:45,850
I can't see anymore...

2695
04:48:46,980 --> 04:48:48,560
and I feel dizzy.

2696
04:48:52,820 --> 04:48:56,980
Are you there?
I can't see.

2697
04:49:05,420 --> 04:49:07,870
Ismael, I've brought your breakfast.

2698
04:49:25,060 --> 04:49:26,680
Good morning, Ismael.

2699
04:49:29,650 --> 04:49:32,640
This is Alexander Ekdahl,
a friend.

2700
04:49:33,990 --> 04:49:35,600
Leave us alone, Aron.

2701
04:49:37,410 --> 04:49:39,860
Don't worry.
I won't eat him...

2702
04:49:41,030 --> 04:49:43,200
even if he does look appetizing.

2703
04:49:46,210 --> 04:49:48,120
You can come back in half an hour.

2704
04:49:49,330 --> 04:49:51,370
- Go now, Aron.
- Uncle Isak...

2705
04:49:51,540 --> 04:49:52,980
Uncle Isak is an old goat and

2706
04:49:52,980 --> 04:49:54,750
needn't know of Alexander's visit.

2707
04:49:56,170 --> 04:49:57,460
Go now.

2708
04:50:18,070 --> 04:50:19,400
No, thank you.

2709
04:50:21,240 --> 04:50:23,730
My name is Ismael,
but you already know that.

2710
04:50:27,000 --> 04:50:29,410
"And he will be a wild man.

2711
04:50:30,380 --> 04:50:33,740
His hand will be against every man,

2712
04:50:34,420 --> 04:50:37,040
and every man's hand against him."

2713
04:50:40,050 --> 04:50:43,460
I'm considered dangerous.
That's why I'm locked up.

2714
04:50:43,600 --> 04:50:45,130
Dangerous in what way?

2715
04:50:47,770 --> 04:50:49,380
Write your name here.

2716
04:50:51,270 --> 04:50:54,430
The pencil's pretty dull,
but it should still serve.

2717
04:50:57,440 --> 04:51:00,780
There, Alexander Ekdahl.

2718
04:51:01,410 --> 04:51:03,020
Now read what you've written.

2719
04:51:05,370 --> 04:51:08,830
It says "Ismael Retzinsky."

2720
04:51:15,460 --> 04:51:19,250
Perhaps we're the same person,
with no boundaries.

2721
04:51:20,470 --> 04:51:22,380
Perhaps we flow through each other,

2722
04:51:22,720 --> 04:51:26,210
stream through each other
boundlessly and magnificently.

2723
04:51:30,480 --> 04:51:32,810
You bear such terrible thoughts...

2724
04:51:34,520 --> 04:51:37,180
it's almost painful to be near you.

2725
04:51:39,820 --> 04:51:41,310
Yet it's also enticing.

2726
04:51:42,820 --> 04:51:46,110
- Do you know why?
- I don't think I want to know.

2727
04:51:51,410 --> 04:51:54,910
You've heard of making an
image of someone you dislike

2728
04:51:55,040 --> 04:51:57,030
and sticking pins in it?

2729
04:51:59,130 --> 04:52:00,670
It's a rather clumsy method

2730
04:52:00,800 --> 04:52:04,380
when you think of the swift
paths an evil thought can travel.

2731
04:52:09,890 --> 04:52:12,350
You're a strange little person.

2732
04:52:14,350 --> 04:52:18,440
You won't speak of that which
is constantly in your thoughts.

2733
04:52:26,780 --> 04:52:28,990
You're thinking of a man's death.

2734
04:52:29,910 --> 04:52:31,200
Wait a moment.

2735
04:52:31,870 --> 04:52:33,830
I know who you're thinking of:

2736
04:52:39,250 --> 04:52:42,040
A tall man with fair,
greying hair.

2737
04:52:42,220 --> 04:52:43,750
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2738
04:52:43,970 --> 04:52:47,960
He has clear blue eyes and a boyish face.

2739
04:52:48,100 --> 04:52:49,710
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2740
04:52:50,720 --> 04:52:54,840
He's asleep and dreams
he's kneeling at the altar.

2741
04:52:55,650 --> 04:52:58,390
Above the altar hangs the crucified prophet.

2742
04:52:59,650 --> 04:53:01,810
In his dream he gets up and cries out,

2743
04:53:02,990 --> 04:53:07,400
"my God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?"

2744
04:53:09,450 --> 04:53:11,280
There is no answer,

2745
04:53:11,700 --> 04:53:13,280
not even a laugh.

2746
04:53:13,790 --> 04:53:15,740
Don't talk like that.

2747
04:53:16,710 --> 04:53:18,240
It is not I talking.

2748
04:53:20,300 --> 04:53:21,790
It is yourself.

2749
04:53:26,220 --> 04:53:27,920
You are not to hesitate.

2750
04:53:30,930 --> 04:53:35,520
He's sound asleep,
plagued by nightmares.

2751
04:53:38,310 --> 04:53:40,180
Give me your hands.

2752
04:53:41,190 --> 04:53:44,810
It isn't really necessary,
but it's safer.

2753
04:53:48,620 --> 04:53:50,570
The doors will be thrown open.

2754
04:53:50,870 --> 04:53:53,200
A scream will echo through the house.

2755
04:53:54,120 --> 04:53:56,240
- I don't want to.
- It's too late.

2756
04:53:57,370 --> 04:54:00,290
You have only one way to go,
and I am with you.

2757
04:54:00,840 --> 04:54:02,750
I obliterate myself.

2758
04:54:03,000 --> 04:54:04,960
I merge into you,
my child.

2759
04:54:05,300 --> 04:54:07,540
Don't be afraid.
I am with you.

2760
04:54:07,760 --> 04:54:09,840
I'm your guardian angel.

2761
04:54:13,970 --> 04:54:17,510
It is 5:00 in the morning,
and the sun has just risen.

2762
04:54:18,350 --> 04:54:20,140
The doors are thrown open.

2763
04:54:20,690 --> 04:54:22,220
No, wait.

2764
04:54:22,610 --> 04:54:27,400
First a horrible scream
echoes through the house.

2765
04:54:28,820 --> 04:54:33,320
A shapeless burning figure
moves across the floor,

2766
04:54:33,910 --> 04:54:34,990
screaming.

2767
04:54:35,120 --> 04:54:36,360
I don't want to.

2768
04:54:36,500 --> 04:54:38,490
Let me go! Let me go!

2769
04:55:17,330 --> 04:55:20,620
The police are here and
insist on speaking to you.

2770
04:55:35,890 --> 04:55:37,880
Honoured, Mrs. Vergerus.

2771
04:55:38,020 --> 04:55:40,550
It is my painful duty,

2772
04:55:40,730 --> 04:55:44,520
as the town's ranking administrator of justice,

2773
04:55:44,810 --> 04:55:48,650
to have to inform you of
the terrible circumstances

2774
04:55:48,780 --> 04:55:51,270
surrounding your husband's horrible death.

2775
04:55:51,780 --> 04:55:54,860
Furthermore, according to the law of the land,

2776
04:55:54,990 --> 04:55:58,900
and in the presence of this witness,
chief inspector Jespersson,

2777
04:55:59,160 --> 04:56:01,760
I must conduct a short and,
I assure you,

2778
04:56:01,760 --> 04:56:03,750
in all respects formal interrogation,

2779
04:56:03,960 --> 04:56:06,950
for which I beg your forgiveness.

2780
04:56:09,130 --> 04:56:10,420
Your husband,

2781
04:56:10,880 --> 04:56:12,460
His Grace the Bishop,

2782
04:56:13,260 --> 04:56:17,880
lost his life this morning
under terrible circumstances.

2783
04:56:20,350 --> 04:56:21,760
May I, madam?

2784
04:56:25,060 --> 04:56:28,600
We think we've been able to
determine the course of events.

2785
04:56:30,190 --> 04:56:33,940
Miss Elsa Bergius,
who was gravely ill, lay in bed.

2786
04:56:34,280 --> 04:56:36,610
On her bedside table stood a lamp.

2787
04:56:37,120 --> 04:56:39,610
By some unfortunate accident,
the lamp fell on the bed

2788
04:56:39,790 --> 04:56:44,370
igniting her nightgown,
hair and bed linens.

2789
04:56:44,500 --> 04:56:48,620
Blazing like a torch,
she ran through the house

2790
04:56:48,880 --> 04:56:53,620
and by chance made it into
the Bishop's bedchamber.

2791
04:56:55,840 --> 04:57:01,130
According to His Grace's sister,
miss Henrietta Vergerus,

2792
04:57:01,720 --> 04:57:05,220
he was in a heavy sleep

2793
04:57:05,350 --> 04:57:06,930
from a soporific

2794
04:57:07,310 --> 04:57:11,400
you had given him earlier that night.

2795
04:57:12,280 --> 04:57:15,140
After a heated quarrel with your husband,

2796
04:57:15,280 --> 04:57:18,070
you left the house

2797
04:57:18,200 --> 04:57:19,810
at 4:20 a.m.

2798
04:57:21,700 --> 04:57:24,410
Miss Bergius flung herself on him,

2799
04:57:24,540 --> 04:57:27,530
igniting his bedclothes and nightshirt.

2800
04:57:28,000 --> 04:57:30,210
His grace woke up and
succeeded in freeing himself

2801
04:57:30,340 --> 04:57:32,830
from the dying woman who was still ablaze.

2802
04:57:34,510 --> 04:57:37,920
But he could not extinguish the flames

2803
04:57:38,590 --> 04:57:40,210
that were now engulfing him.

2804
04:57:41,850 --> 04:57:45,470
Old Mrs. Vergerus found her son

2805
04:57:46,190 --> 04:57:49,930
with his body burnt and face charred.

2806
04:57:51,570 --> 04:57:56,400
He showed faint signs of life and
said he was in unbearable agony.

2807
04:57:57,660 --> 04:58:00,400
Ten minutes later, the doctor and
ambulance arrived on the scene,

2808
04:58:01,080 --> 04:58:05,030
but by then His Grace had already
been released from his suffering

2809
04:58:05,960 --> 04:58:08,290
and had taken his last breath.

2810
04:58:12,460 --> 04:58:15,870
Although I can't overlook the fact

2811
04:58:16,010 --> 04:58:21,220
that the sleeping aid you gave him
possibly made the disaster worse,

2812
04:58:21,350 --> 04:58:24,680
I also cannot attach any
serious importance to it.

2813
04:58:25,020 --> 04:58:28,730
Therefore, I must characterize the
event as an ill-fated coincidence

2814
04:58:28,900 --> 04:58:31,980
of extremely unfortunate circumstances.

2815
04:58:33,690 --> 04:58:36,770
Therefore I beg

2816
04:58:37,610 --> 04:58:39,020
to extend to you

2817
04:58:39,780 --> 04:58:43,070
my deepest,
most sincere condolences.

2818
04:58:46,000 --> 04:58:47,450
Come, Jespersson.

2819
04:59:03,260 --> 04:59:06,100
Madame, I had the honour
to wait upon you yesterday,

2820
04:59:06,270 --> 04:59:09,930
but your maid showed me the
door with an offensive message.

2821
04:59:11,440 --> 04:59:14,930
Monsieur le marquis,
I blush at your presumption

2822
04:59:15,020 --> 04:59:18,610
and can only deplore the fact
that my servants this morning

2823
04:59:18,900 --> 04:59:21,440
were unable to show you the door once again.

2824
04:59:22,950 --> 04:59:25,110
You say that you love me, sir.

2825
04:59:25,620 --> 04:59:28,990
In that case,
be so kind as to spare me your presence,

2826
04:59:29,080 --> 04:59:32,740
because, frankly,
it does me only harm,

2827
04:59:32,830 --> 04:59:36,790
not to mention the anger over the
embarrassment you caused me

2828
04:59:37,170 --> 04:59:39,160
in the presence of her Majesty the queen.

2829
04:59:41,630 --> 04:59:45,090
Marquis, to what do we owe the
honour of such an early visit?

2830
04:59:45,180 --> 04:59:47,260
- Count!
- Marquis!

2831
04:59:47,390 --> 04:59:52,130
Only the thought of the blood
you have shed for your king, sir,

2832
04:59:52,480 --> 04:59:56,970
prevents me from instantly
and with all my power

2833
04:59:57,400 --> 05:00:00,440
throwing back in your face...

2834
05:00:00,990 --> 05:00:03,690
The infamy you have committed
against the marquise --

2835
05:00:03,820 --> 05:00:08,610
The infamy you have committed
against the marquise.

2836
05:00:10,000 --> 05:00:13,740
It's not enough this is the worst rubbish
ever written in the French language.

2837
05:00:13,870 --> 05:00:18,040
In addition, the translation is terrible,
Mr. Landahl.

2838
05:00:18,550 --> 05:00:21,960
I'm telling you honestly, even though
I know you've gone to great trouble.

2839
05:00:22,090 --> 05:00:24,500
I know it was done in haste,
Mr. Morsing,

2840
05:00:25,340 --> 05:00:27,260
but we find ourselves in a crisis.

2841
05:00:27,390 --> 05:00:31,680
In the past we performed
Shakespeare and the great Moliere.

2842
05:00:32,270 --> 05:00:36,480
We were even so bold as to let
Henrik Ibsen's voice be heard.

2843
05:00:36,770 --> 05:00:38,850
Public taste, Mr. Morsing.

2844
05:00:39,940 --> 05:00:42,560
They no longer wish to
hear the songs of giants.

2845
05:00:42,700 --> 05:00:44,860
They're content with the tunes of dwarfs.

2846
05:00:45,530 --> 05:00:50,030
No one cares about our theatre,
neither the public nor the Ekdahl family.

2847
05:00:50,370 --> 05:00:52,030
Funds are running dry.

2848
05:00:53,210 --> 05:00:55,160
Our actors fare badly.

2849
05:00:56,000 --> 05:00:56,960
Hanna.

2850
05:00:59,000 --> 05:01:00,660
Emilie dear.

2851
05:01:16,400 --> 05:01:18,390
Now you'll stay with us,
won't you?

2852
05:01:19,860 --> 05:01:22,100
I don't know why I'm so damned moved.

2853
05:01:24,280 --> 05:01:25,890
Dear Mrs. Ekdahl.

2854
05:01:34,460 --> 05:01:36,700
I'm at a loss for words.

2855
05:01:43,880 --> 05:01:45,710
Now everything will be right again.

2856
05:01:50,680 --> 05:01:52,090
Dearest Emilie.

2857
05:01:56,730 --> 05:01:58,060
Welcome back.

2858
05:01:59,560 --> 05:02:00,890
Thank you.

2859
05:02:43,730 --> 05:02:48,900
My dear, dear friends.

2860
05:02:50,990 --> 05:02:53,450
I am more moved than I can say.

2861
05:02:56,330 --> 05:02:57,940
Dear friends...

2862
05:02:59,750 --> 05:03:00,990
dearest mama...

2863
05:03:01,710 --> 05:03:04,120
my most beloved wife, Alma...

2864
05:03:05,500 --> 05:03:10,620
my darling Emilie,
more beautiful than ever.

2865
05:03:11,430 --> 05:03:13,880
My wonderful children, Petra,

2866
05:03:14,010 --> 05:03:15,840
Jenny and Putte,

2867
05:03:16,020 --> 05:03:20,380
and little miss Helena Viktoria,

2868
05:03:20,520 --> 05:03:23,640
lying so peacefully in her bed.

2869
05:03:26,110 --> 05:03:27,850
And dear Maj...

2870
05:03:29,780 --> 05:03:31,770
of whom I'm very fond.

2871
05:03:35,200 --> 05:03:39,110
And not forgetting my
incomparable brother Carl,

2872
05:03:40,000 --> 05:03:42,030
and his sweet wife.

2873
05:03:42,210 --> 05:03:45,620
My most honoured friend,

2874
05:03:45,750 --> 05:03:47,080
Isak Jacobi,

2875
05:03:47,800 --> 05:03:52,630
who has rendered immeasurable
service to this family.

2876
05:03:52,720 --> 05:03:54,300
Dear Vega and Ester,

2877
05:03:54,430 --> 05:03:59,640
and you good friends who
faithfully help us up the hill of life.

2878
05:04:01,480 --> 05:04:03,390
Last, but not least

2879
05:04:03,520 --> 05:04:05,730
dear and admired,

2880
05:04:06,440 --> 05:04:10,060
greatly talented and brilliant artists,

2881
05:04:10,240 --> 05:04:14,900
if I could I would encompass
you all in one big embrace

2882
05:04:14,990 --> 05:04:18,110
and plant a kiss on your brows.

2883
05:04:18,240 --> 05:04:21,410
A kiss which,
more than words,

2884
05:04:21,540 --> 05:04:24,830
would tell you of my happiness and love.

2885
05:04:25,670 --> 05:04:27,030
Cheers, everyone!

2886
05:04:34,180 --> 05:04:37,170
Just imagine:
We're all together again!

2887
05:04:37,930 --> 05:04:41,920
Our little world has closed around us in safety,

2888
05:04:42,060 --> 05:04:44,600
wisdom and order.

2889
05:04:45,480 --> 05:04:47,850
After a period of fear and confusion...

2890
05:04:49,280 --> 05:04:53,020
death's shadows have been routed,

2891
05:04:54,110 --> 05:04:59,780
winter has been put to flight,
and joy has returned to our hearts.

2892
05:05:00,830 --> 05:05:03,490
Now I must have a look
at little Helena Viktoria.

2893
05:05:08,630 --> 05:05:12,500
She's laughing at me,
my daughter Helena Viktoria.

2894
05:05:13,170 --> 05:05:14,460
Now for a speech.

2895
05:05:17,010 --> 05:05:19,090
Go on,
laugh at your old father.

2896
05:05:19,220 --> 05:05:21,960
Never mind what he says.
It's only nonsense.

2897
05:05:28,310 --> 05:05:31,310
My wisdom is simple.

2898
05:05:32,230 --> 05:05:36,440
There are those who despise it,
but I don't give a damn --

2899
05:05:36,990 --> 05:05:39,650
Forgive me, mama.
I noticed you raised your right eyebrow.

2900
05:05:39,830 --> 05:05:42,990
You think your son is talking too much.
Don't worry. I will be brief.

2901
05:05:43,370 --> 05:05:46,530
Therefore... and consequently...

2902
05:05:49,000 --> 05:05:53,170
we Ekdahls have not come into
the world to see through it.

2903
05:05:53,340 --> 05:05:54,420
Never think that.

2904
05:05:55,260 --> 05:06:00,340
We are not equipped for such excursions.

2905
05:06:01,180 --> 05:06:05,010
We might just as well ignore the big things.

2906
05:06:06,480 --> 05:06:12,020
We must live in the little world.

2907
05:06:14,110 --> 05:06:16,150
We will be content with that

2908
05:06:17,070 --> 05:06:21,160
and cultivate it and make the best of it.

2909
05:06:25,290 --> 05:06:26,900
Suddenly death strikes.

2910
05:06:28,710 --> 05:06:32,450
Suddenly the abyss opens.

2911
05:06:34,090 --> 05:06:37,380
Suddenly the storm howls,
and disaster is upon us.

2912
05:06:38,010 --> 05:06:39,840
All that we know.

2913
05:06:40,510 --> 05:06:44,130
But let us not think of all that unpleasantness.

2914
05:06:44,600 --> 05:06:47,560
We Ekdahls love our subterfuges.

2915
05:06:48,230 --> 05:06:53,890
Rob a man of his subterfuges and he
goes mad and begins lashing out.

2916
05:06:54,020 --> 05:06:58,190
Damn it all,
people must be intelligible!

2917
05:06:59,910 --> 05:07:03,070
Otherwise we don't dare to
love them or speak ill of them.

2918
05:07:04,240 --> 05:07:08,490
We must be able to grasp the world and reality

2919
05:07:09,250 --> 05:07:13,910
so we can complain of their
monotony with a clear conscience.

2920
05:07:15,670 --> 05:07:20,590
Don't be sad,
dear splendid artists.

2921
05:07:22,510 --> 05:07:27,430
Actors and actresses,
we need you all the same.

2922
05:07:28,430 --> 05:07:33,600
It is you who must give us
our supernatural shivers,

2923
05:07:34,440 --> 05:07:37,770
or better yet,
our innermost diversions.

2924
05:07:41,860 --> 05:07:46,030
The world is a den of
thieves and night is falling.

2925
05:07:48,200 --> 05:07:51,870
Evil breaks its chains and runs
through the world like a mad dog.

2926
05:07:54,130 --> 05:07:56,040
The poison affects us all,

2927
05:07:56,750 --> 05:07:59,460
us Ekdahls and everyone else.

2928
05:07:59,630 --> 05:08:01,290
No one escapes,

2929
05:08:02,510 --> 05:08:08,180
not even Helena Viktoria or little Aurora.

2930
05:08:11,440 --> 05:08:12,970
So it shall be.

2931
05:08:15,230 --> 05:08:20,650
Therefore let us be happy while we are happy.

2932
05:08:21,900 --> 05:08:26,270
Let us be kind, generous,
affectionate and good.

2933
05:08:27,580 --> 05:08:31,490
It is necessary,
and not at all shameful...

2934
05:08:32,960 --> 05:08:36,670
to take pleasure in the little world.

2935
05:08:38,750 --> 05:08:40,370
Good food...

2936
05:08:41,420 --> 05:08:43,410
gentle smiles...

2937
05:08:45,090 --> 05:08:49,340
fruit trees in bloom, waltzes.

2938
05:08:50,390 --> 05:08:55,560
My dearest friends,
I'm done talking,

2939
05:08:55,690 --> 05:08:57,680
and you can take it as you like:

2940
05:08:57,860 --> 05:09:02,400
The sentimental ramblings of
an uneducated restaurateur

2941
05:09:02,530 --> 05:09:04,890
or the pitiful babbling of an old man.

2942
05:09:05,030 --> 05:09:07,020
I don't care.

2943
05:09:21,760 --> 05:09:24,870
I hold a little empress in my arms.

2944
05:09:28,050 --> 05:09:32,420
It's tangible yet immeasurable.

2945
05:09:35,060 --> 05:09:38,770
One day she will prove
everything I just said wrong.

2946
05:09:40,230 --> 05:09:43,600
One day she will not only rule the little world,

2947
05:09:44,610 --> 05:09:46,570
but everything.

2948
05:09:48,160 --> 05:09:49,690
Everything.

2949
05:10:11,430 --> 05:10:13,340
You still sitting there?

2950
05:10:15,060 --> 05:10:16,920
Aren't you going to bed?

2951
05:10:17,100 --> 05:10:19,090
Now we'll have champagne.

2952
05:10:19,610 --> 05:10:22,850
We will, will we?

2953
05:10:25,240 --> 05:10:27,320
Well, I'm going to bed.

2954
05:10:27,950 --> 05:10:31,310
- We're supposed to have champagne.
- Don't forget your jacket.

2955
05:10:31,620 --> 05:10:33,780
Yes, colonel!

2956
05:10:33,950 --> 05:10:35,740
There, there, my child.

2957
05:10:35,870 --> 05:10:38,990
Be a good girl now,
so that mama can go to bed.

2958
05:10:40,130 --> 05:10:42,620
I think you've finished eating,
in any case.

2959
05:10:42,960 --> 05:10:45,750
- I'll take her.
- Thank you, Rosa.

2960
05:10:48,970 --> 05:10:51,460
- How do you like it here?
- Everyone's so kind.

2961
05:10:52,050 --> 05:10:53,970
Especially Mr. Ekdahl.

2962
05:10:54,310 --> 05:10:56,220
He must be a real friend of humanity.

2963
05:10:56,480 --> 05:10:58,340
That he certainly is.

2964
05:10:58,640 --> 05:11:02,730
He's particularly kind to young girls,
so you watch out, Rosa.

2965
05:11:02,860 --> 05:11:04,390
Oh, my!

2966
05:11:09,780 --> 05:11:11,650
- Good night, madam.
- Good night, Rosa.

2967
05:11:34,180 --> 05:11:35,920
We're going to have champagne.

2968
05:11:36,060 --> 05:11:39,970
If you're a good boy,
I'll bring you a beer and sandwich in bed.

2969
05:11:44,730 --> 05:11:47,970
I'm sure Emilie will want a glass of champagne.

2970
05:11:48,110 --> 05:11:51,350
We'll raise a toast to our daughters.

2971
05:11:51,820 --> 05:11:53,690
Go to bed now, Gusten.

2972
05:11:53,820 --> 05:11:57,240
I'm so damned happy!

2973
05:11:59,080 --> 05:12:02,660
That's nice, Gusten,
but you'll have a headache tomorrow.

2974
05:12:03,040 --> 05:12:05,870
Imagine: We're together again.

2975
05:12:12,300 --> 05:12:15,670
I'm going to the country tomorrow
to speak with the workmen.

2976
05:12:16,050 --> 05:12:17,720
Do you need anything taken care of?

2977
05:12:17,890 --> 05:12:20,850
- I'll be there until Thursday.
- I'll come on Tuesday.

2978
05:12:20,980 --> 05:12:24,760
Don't you think I have the
best wife in the world?

2979
05:12:24,900 --> 05:12:26,890
Much better than you deserve.

2980
05:12:28,440 --> 05:12:31,560
And the world's prettiest little mistress.

2981
05:12:31,860 --> 05:12:34,230
A real darling.

2982
05:12:34,950 --> 05:12:37,160
- Are you going in the morning?
- Not until 2:00.

2983
05:12:39,750 --> 05:12:44,610
When I see you,
I want to weep with joy.

2984
05:12:44,750 --> 05:12:48,410
To think you're back with us again!

2985
05:12:51,510 --> 05:12:53,920
- Good night, Gusten.
- Good night.

2986
05:12:55,010 --> 05:12:57,750
Be a good boy now,
and remember that Alma needs her sleep.

2987
05:13:00,600 --> 05:13:03,390
I know what Alma needs.

2988
05:13:31,170 --> 05:13:32,330
Aunt Emilie.

2989
05:13:32,880 --> 05:13:34,750
What do you two want at this hour?

2990
05:13:34,750 --> 05:13:36,870
We want to move to Stockholm.

2991
05:13:37,010 --> 05:13:40,590
Marianne Egerman is opening a
boutique and wants us to help.

2992
05:13:40,970 --> 05:13:43,710
- And we'd like to.
- We'd very much like to.

2993
05:13:45,230 --> 05:13:47,060
But we have a big problem.

2994
05:13:47,190 --> 05:13:49,720
Papa insists on that cafe for Maj.

2995
05:13:49,860 --> 05:13:51,440
He's so kind.

2996
05:13:53,490 --> 05:13:57,230
- Maj's had enough of his tutelage.
- He's so kind.

2997
05:13:57,360 --> 05:14:01,070
She wants to live her own life and
decide for herself and her baby.

2998
05:14:01,450 --> 05:14:03,280
I don't know what to do.

2999
05:14:03,410 --> 05:14:04,900
We've spoken to mama.

3000
05:14:05,160 --> 05:14:08,750
She was awfully upset at first and
said we couldn't do that to papa.

3001
05:14:09,330 --> 05:14:13,540
Then she calmed down and said
that life must take its course...

3002
05:14:14,670 --> 05:14:17,010
and that one shouldn't force one's children.

3003
05:14:17,680 --> 05:14:19,880
Though she felt sorry for papa's sake.

3004
05:14:21,140 --> 05:14:22,880
It's awful.

3005
05:14:23,010 --> 05:14:25,130
You must think of yourself.

3006
05:14:25,680 --> 05:14:29,270
After all, papa's an old man.
Isn't that true, aunt Emilie?

3007
05:14:29,730 --> 05:14:32,190
Go to bed now.
I'll have a word with grandmama.

3008
05:15:40,470 --> 05:15:43,250
Emilie, how nice to see you!
Welcome!

3009
05:15:43,600 --> 05:15:45,260
I need to speak with you.

3010
05:15:45,430 --> 05:15:47,340
- Would you like a cognac?
- No, thank you.

3011
05:15:47,470 --> 05:15:49,090
Is it anything serious?

3012
05:15:49,600 --> 05:15:52,810
Oh, yes.
Maj and Petra want to move to Stockholm.

3013
05:15:53,520 --> 05:15:54,760
What do you think?

3014
05:16:20,800 --> 05:16:22,630
You can't escape me.

3015
05:16:28,640 --> 05:16:30,130
One other thing.

3016
05:16:30,310 --> 05:16:32,260
You're right.

3017
05:16:32,770 --> 05:16:36,350
On his deathbed,
Oscar asked you to take charge of the theatre.

3018
05:16:37,190 --> 05:16:39,310
I was there.
I remember it well.

3019
05:16:39,730 --> 05:16:41,570
Gustav Adolf will be awfully hurt.

3020
05:16:41,820 --> 05:16:44,730
Why all this concern for Gustav Adolf?

3021
05:16:45,660 --> 05:16:47,610
He has a good head for business,

3022
05:16:47,830 --> 05:16:50,660
but he doesn't know a thing about theatre.

3023
05:16:51,160 --> 05:16:53,370
It's your theatre,
my dear Emilie.

3024
05:16:55,040 --> 05:16:57,530
It's about time we explain
to our backwoods napoleon

3025
05:16:57,750 --> 05:16:59,490
that he's facing his waterloo.

3026
05:17:00,670 --> 05:17:04,040
I'd like you to read a new
play by august Strindberg.

3027
05:17:04,970 --> 05:17:07,250
That nasty misogynist!

3028
05:17:07,510 --> 05:17:08,500
No, thank you.

3029
05:17:08,680 --> 05:17:10,590
It's called a dream play.

3030
05:17:12,680 --> 05:17:14,680
I thought we'd both perform in it.

3031
05:17:15,560 --> 05:17:18,350
Not on your life.
I haven't appeared on stage in --

3032
05:17:18,480 --> 05:17:22,320
All the more reason.
I won't disturb you any longer.

3033
05:17:23,400 --> 05:17:26,190
You never disturb me.

3034
05:17:32,290 --> 05:17:34,200
What are you laughing at?

3035
05:17:34,460 --> 05:17:37,070
Now we're the ones in charge,
aren't we?

3036
05:17:37,540 --> 05:17:38,700
Do you think so?

3037
05:17:40,840 --> 05:17:43,870
- Good night, dearest.
- Good night, my dear.

3038
05:18:25,920 --> 05:18:31,540
"Everything can happen.
Everything is possible and probable.

3039
05:18:32,390 --> 05:18:35,130
Time and space do not exist.

3040
05:18:35,810 --> 05:18:39,100
On a flimsy framework of reality,

3041
05:18:39,600 --> 05:18:44,940
the imagination spins,
weaving new patterns."
