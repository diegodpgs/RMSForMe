1
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,640
There.

2
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,840
Technicals, nine o'clock.

3
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,030
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

4
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,340
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

5
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,710
I got it, Matt.
I don't think we can touch this.

6
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,150
Command, Super 64...

7
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,960
We got militia shooting civilians
at the food distribution center.

8
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,300
Request permission to engage.

9
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,700
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

10
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,700
Negative, command.

11
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,470
UN's jurisdiction, 64.
We cannot intervene.

12
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,230
Return to base. Over.
Roger.

13
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,570
64 returning.

14
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,120
Ready, Mr. Atto.

15
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,440
Leaving.

16
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,300
General Garrison?

17
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,740
No, thanks. I got one.

18
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,710
But these are Cuban.

19
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,950
Bolivar Belicoso.

20
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,370
So is this.

21
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,880
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

22
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,430
I see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

23
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,300
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

24
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,200
Me?

25
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,670
But am I that important?

26
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,630
I hardly think so.

27
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,830
You're just a businessman.
Trying to make a living.

28
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,770
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

29
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,310
You've been here, what?

30
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,450
Six weeks?

31
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,690
Six weeks you are trying
to catch the general.

32
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,390
You put up reward posters.

33
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,160
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the KO Corral?

34
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
It's the OK Corral.

35
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,070
Do you think bringing me in will
make him suddenly come to you?

36
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,470
Make him more agreeable?

37
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,040
You know where he sleeps.

38
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,150
You pay for his beds,
much less his militia.

39
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,020
We're not leaving
Somalia till we find him.

40
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,860
And we will find him.

41
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,560
Don't think because I grew
up without running water...

42
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,630
I am simple, General.

43
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,040
I do know something about history.

44
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,040
See all this?
It's simply shaping tomorrow.

45
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,670
A tomorrow without a lot of
Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

46
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,250
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.

47
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,580
Mr. Garrison, I think you
shouldn't have come here.

48
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,090
This is civil war.

49
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,890
This is our war.

50
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,890
Not yours.

51
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,400
300,000 dead and counting.

52
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,970
That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

53
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,070
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

54
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,510
How'd he strike you?

55
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,780
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

56
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,620
Yeah, he's a good catch.

57
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,460
It'll take time,
but Aidid will feel the loss.

58
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,390
I'm not sure time is something
we got in great supply.

59
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,630
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

60
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,060
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

61
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,300
They've been calling for situation
reports every morning this week.

62
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,710
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

63
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,890
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

64
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,720
I'll be your pilot today.

65
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,890
Federal regulations designate this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

66
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,300
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer
program will earn 100 free credits.

67
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,030
And as always, the air sickness bags
are located in the seatback in front of you.

68
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,910
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

69
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,440
You're still clear.

70
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,920
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

71
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,320
I've got some bad news.

72
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,230
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.

73
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,160
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.

74
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,340
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

75
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,200
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

76
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,370
If it's not in the
dictionary it doesn't count!

77
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,540
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

78
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,780
It does have to be in the dictionary!

79
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,180
When we get back to the base,
it's coming off.

80
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,890
You touch my "limo" and
I'll spank you, Nightstalker.

81
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,080
Yeah, promises.

82
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,590
That's a nice beach down there.

83
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,350
How's the water?

84
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,730
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

85
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,400
Name.
Todd.

86
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,540
Last name.
Blackburn.

87
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,040
First name, Todd.

88
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,180
So, what's it like?
What's what like?

89
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,620
Mogadishu. The fighting.

90
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,620
Serial number.
72163427.

91
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,490
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

92
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,970
Secondly, I wouldn't know about
the fighting, so don't ask.

93
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,560
Why not?

94
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,660
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

95
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,870
You look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

96
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,510
I have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from doing missions.

97
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,950
Typing.

98
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,450
Can you type?
No.

99
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,920
Date of birth.
2-27-75.

100
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,760
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

101
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,040
Let's bring it in.

102
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,490
Nice, man! Very smooth!

103
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,760
Single shot through the engine block.

104
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,120
Shit, that's a shame.
That was a nice jeep.

105
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,190
Cease fire! Cease fire!

106
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,880
Check your weapons!

107
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,110
Sergeant Eversmann.

108
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,960
Private First Class Blackburn.

109
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,290
Yeah?

110
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,960
Reporting for duty.

111
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,970
Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be around here somewhere.

112
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,270
Can I leave him with you?

113
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,300
Yeah, go ahead.

114
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,580
You brought your weapon.
Yes, sir.

115
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,710
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

116
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,950
When did you get in?
Just now, Sergeant.

117
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,980
Hey, who's hungry?

118
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,850
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

119
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,110
Not if General Garrison is asking.
I'm asking.

120
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,510
Have a nice meal, Captain.

121
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,630
Hey, man, there's a line.
I know.

122
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,470
Well, this isn't the back of it.
Yeah, I know.

123
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,000
Sergeant. Sergeant.

124
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,900
What's going on here?

125
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,000
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

126
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,240
I'm talking about your weapon.

127
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,940
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

128
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,420
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

129
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,850
Well, this is my safety, sir.

130
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,630
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

131
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,530
You Delta boys are a bunch
of undisciplined cowboys.

132
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,230
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

133
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,200
When we get on a five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

134
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,330
Y'all better learn to be team players.

135
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,600
We're done here.

136
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,710
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

137
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,720
Well, this is my boot, son.

138
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,990
And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

139
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,830
Is that a Jersey accent?
I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

140
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,900
Take those sunglasses off.

141
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,370
Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

142
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,670
I don't want to see them on you again.

143
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,140
Is that a hot weapon?

144
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,850
Is that your move?

145
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,880
Is my hand on the piece?

146
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,690
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

147
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,460
I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling others.

148
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,060
Well, she's just lying in wait.

149
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,960
Yikes.

150
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
It's good. You're really improving.

151
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,300
If I may make a suggestion... Observation.

152
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,500
Go ahead.

153
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,080
It's a children's book, right?
Right.

154
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,810
They are not supposed to scare the
living shit out of the children.

155
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,720
This is the part of the story where
our knight is slaying the dragon.

156
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,450
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

157
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,520
Thought you finished that last week.

158
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,420
You done?

159
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,490
Hey, we are at the
10-yard line here, men.

160
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,160
You understand?

161
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,160
Can you count? One, two, ten.

162
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,840
Okay? Where are my running backs?

163
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,840
Where are my running backs?

164
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,470
Hey, I didn't see you
at church on Sunday.

165
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,620
You had something more important to do?

166
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,250
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

167
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,620
I will make you believe, you understand?

168
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,270
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

169
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,840
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.

170
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,110
All right, carry on.

171
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,650
I'd like a word, specialist.
Sir.

172
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,820
You understand why we have a
chain of command, don't you?

173
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,890
Roger that, sir.

174
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,450
If you ever undermine me again,
you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

175
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,560
Till you taste no difference
between shit and French fries.

176
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,760
Are we clear?
Hoo-ah, sir.

177
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,770
All right.

178
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,670
Listen to this:

179
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,510
If one skinny kills another his clan
owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

180
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,050
A hundred camels.

181
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,520
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

182
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,960
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

183
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,660
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

184
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,890
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

185
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,960
Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

186
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,130
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.

187
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,470
See, what you guys fail to realize is
the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

188
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,510
He believes in this mission down
to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

189
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,010
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

190
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,340
No food, no education, no future.

191
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,020
I just figure that, I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

192
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,610
We can help...

193
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,130
Or we can sit back and watch the
country destroy itself on CNN.

194
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,180
Right?

195
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,500
I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

196
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,760
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

197
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,630
Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

198
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,170
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

199
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

200
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,420
Stay away from the cans!

201
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,020
Die, gas-pumper!

202
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,490
Stay away from those cans!

203
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,520
No, no, stay back.

204
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,590
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

205
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,610
John, it's okay.
John, it's okay. It's okay.

206
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,820
Well, he'll be fine.
But not in this army.

207
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,490
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

208
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,630
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

209
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,900
You got a problem with that?
No, sir.

210
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,070
It's a big responsibility.

211
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,700
Your men will look to you
to make the right decisions.

212
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,840
Their lives depend on it.

213
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,140
All right.

214
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,790
Rangers lead the way, sir.
All the way.

215
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,420
Good luck.

216
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,730
A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours.

217
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,300
I say "may" because
we all know by now...

218
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,770
With the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

219
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,810
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

220
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,710
Two tier-one personalities
may be present:

221
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,210
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

222
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,880
And Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

223
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,950
These are the guys we're after.

224
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,190
Today we go.

225
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,250
Same mission template as before.

226
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,600
1545, Assault Force Delta will
infiltrate the target building...

227
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,000
And seize all suspects within.

228
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,110
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under command of Capt. Steele...

229
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,440
Will rope in at 1546...

230
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,950
And hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

231
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,810
No one gets in or out.

232
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,610
Extraction Force:

233
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,450
Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee
column will drive in at 1547...

234
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,590
On Hawlwadig Road and hold
just short of the Olympic Hotel.

235
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,260
Wait for the green light.

236
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,330
Now once Delta gives the word...

237
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:27,270
McKnight's column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks.

238
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,240
Immediately after the
prisoners are loaded...

239
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,500
The four Ranger chalks will collapse
back to the target building...

240
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,110
Load up on humvees...

241
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:40,180
And the entire ground force will
exfil the 3 miles back to base.

242
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,720
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

243
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,660
Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

244
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,920
But Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

245
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,960
Too high-profile.

246
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,360
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

247
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,800
With miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

248
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,410
Colonel Harrell.

249
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,940
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

250
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,280
And I will coordinate ground forces.

251
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,910
Colonel Matthews.

252
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,280
Mission launch code word is Irene.

253
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,740
Questions?

254
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,320
Which building is it, sir?

255
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,460
We're confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.

256
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,090
I don't choose the time
or place of their meetings.

257
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,070
I didn't say a word, sir.

258
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,770
Make no mistake, once you're
in the Bakara market...

259
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,240
You're in an entirely hostile district.

260
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,150
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

261
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,980
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market...

262
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,820
So remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

263
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,260
Now, let's go get this thing done.

264
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,990
Good luck, gentlemen.

265
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,870
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

266
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,270
No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

267
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,930
Afternoon when they're
all fucked up on khat...

268
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,270
Only part of the city Aidid can mount
a counter-attack on short notice...

269
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,550
What's not to like?
Life's imperfect.

270
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,480
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,
it's imperfect.

271
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,390
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

272
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,860
What the fuck, Smith?

273
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,730
Well?
Well, what?

274
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,370
We going?

275
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,500
Why should I tell you that?
Because I'm me.

276
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,540
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

277
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,270
Bakara market.
All right.

278
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,350
Listen, Smith, I need you to back
me up out there today, all right?

279
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,750
Keep sharp.

280
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,550
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

281
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,120
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

282
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,060
Nothing.

283
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:42,270
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

284
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,070
This, my friend, is a science.

285
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,780
You're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

286
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,110
About "be all you can be."

287
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,110
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

288
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,610
I made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

289
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,650
Got to be a Ranger.

290
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,190
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"
or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

291
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,560
What happened to you?
Ping-Pong accident.

292
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,920
What?

293
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,270
So guess what.

294
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,670
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

295
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,500
You're fucking me.

296
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,210
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

297
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,580
Sergeant Eversmann said to
get your stuff and get ready.

298
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,720
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

299
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,220
Oh, yeah.

300
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,080
Hell, yeah.

301
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,950
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and
give him ammo when he needs it.

302
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,330
Hoo-ah?
Hoo-ah.

303
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,920
I wouldn't worry about that.
Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

304
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,070
Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

305
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,400
Might even be fun.

306
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,380
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

307
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,340
Choppers going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

308
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,080
Look, you guys,
this is my first time as chalk leader...

309
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,720
But, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

310
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,330
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

311
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,160
We're elite.

312
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,990
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

313
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,830
Any questions?

314
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,900
We're going to be okay.

315
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,570
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

316
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,930
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

317
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,310
You won't need that, either.

318
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,750
We'll be back before dark.

319
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,540
You might as well take
dope and beer instead.

320
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,020
What?

321
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,150
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

322
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,060
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got 50 pounds of gear.

323
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,360
You don't need another 12.

324
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,940
I don't know about you,
I don't plan on getting shot running away.

325
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,530
Well, I better keep mine in.

326
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,610
Grimes.

327
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,870
Most important thing:

328
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,280
Remember, when everyone is shooting,
shoot in the same direction.

329
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,250
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

330
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,950
That's bad luck.
No, it's smart.

331
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,060
All Delta do that.

332
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,860
That's bad luck too, man.

333
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,490
Come on, let's go.

334
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,910
It's a good thing you're
right-handed, Adonis.

335
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:09,240
If not, I don't know what you'd do.
You're a funny guy, man.

336
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,680
I'm not taking no death letter.
We have a deal.

337
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,480
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

338
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,920
Blackburn, you okay?
Excited.

339
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,890
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.

340
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,290
You ever shot at anybody before?

341
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,860
No, sir.

342
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,700
Me neither.

343
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,410
Think he's reliable?

344
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,010
Well, we'll see.
It's his first time out.

345
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,560
Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
Yes, sir.

346
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,460
Tell him to turn his radio off.

347
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,520
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

348
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,500
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.

349
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,280
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

350
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,840
Pick up if you're there.

351
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,690
I'm just calling to make
sure everything's all right.

352
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,720
I'll call you in a couple hours.

353
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,690
You'd better not be sleeping.

354
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,990
Your move, Randy.

355
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,260
I'm missing you.

356
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,070
I love you, baby.

357
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,840
Hello? Hello?

358
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,300
Thanks, bud.

359
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,580
You know, it's kind of funny.

360
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,310
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

361
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,950
Could almost be a good place to visit.

362
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,490
Almost.

363
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,220
You don't think we should be here.

364
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,620
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.

365
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,340
Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

366
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,640
Just goes right out the window.

367
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,440
I just want to do it right today.

368
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,910
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

369
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,980
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

370
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,610
Abdi, come in.

371
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,580
Abdi, can you hear me?
Is this the place?

372
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,120
Abdi, come in.

373
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,020
Can you hear me? Abdi.

374
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,790
Abdi, come in.
Is this the place?

375
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,470
To my right side, above the cafe.

376
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,100
He says this is the building.

377
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,770
He's certain?

378
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,210
Abdi, you need to be sure.

379
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,810
Are you sure?

380
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,820
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

381
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,660
But there's too many militia.

382
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,560
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

383
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,060
Now he's saying the building's
a couple blocks down...

384
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,630
But if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

385
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,590
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

386
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,330
Tell him I want his skinny ass
parked in front of the building.

387
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,570
He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

388
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,970
Three miles to the target.
We're never off the main roads.

389
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,240
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

390
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,510
And we wait until extraction
of prisoners is complete here.

391
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,550
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

392
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,150
Load the prisoners, the assault-blocking
forces and bring them back.

393
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,050
Home in an hour. Okay?

394
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,560
There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

395
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,900
But be careful what you shoot at.
People do live there.

396
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,760
Hoo-ah.

397
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,910
Last one of these guys shot himself
in the head playing Russian roulette.

398
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,900
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

399
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,110
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time.

400
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:31,210
He sounds scared shitless.
Good. That's always a good sign.

401
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,790
That's it. That's our signal.

402
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,290
All right.

403
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,560
All QRF out of the airspace.

404
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,090
All QRF out of the airspace.

405
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,430
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.

406
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,550
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up and ready.
Star 41 up and ready.

407
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,020
Irene!

408
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,160
Copy, Irene.

409
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,330
Fucking Irene!

410
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,040
Come on.

411
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,950
Good luck, boys.

412
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,450
Be careful.

413
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,950
No one gets left behind.

414
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,190
What's wrong?

415
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,190
Nothing.
He's just never done that before.

416
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,670
Aw, fuck!

417
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,960
Let's go.

418
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,740
Sergeant Struecker.
Let's roll.

419
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,270
Two minutes.

420
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,870
Two minutes.

421
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,620
Why are they burning tires?

422
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,760
Signals to the militia
that we're coming!

423
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,260
Okay, 56, looks like there's
some friendlies on the ground.

424
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,390
Looks like I've got
a tally on the voice.

425
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,210
One minute.

426
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,810
One minute.

427
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,550
What's that for?

428
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,820
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

429
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,720
Touching base.

430
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,190
Two feet, one foot...

431
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,300
Clear.

432
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Little birds touching down at target.

433
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,040
Ropes!

434
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,810
Go! Go! Go!

435
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,530
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.

436
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,030
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.

437
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,340
Down! Get down!

438
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,310
Down! Stay down!

439
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,250
Get down! Everybody down!

440
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,760
You, down!

441
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,980
Get down!

442
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,080
On the floor.

443
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,870
Let's go, let's go!

444
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,630
Grimesy! No fear!

445
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,700
Oh, yeah, right!

446
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,280
Rangers securing perimeter.
Four corners.

447
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,210
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

448
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,870
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

449
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,280
Well, shoot back!

450
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,190
This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

451
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,060
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.

452
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,230
Super 62, take up an overhead
pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.

453
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,800
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

454
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,110
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

455
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,710
Go, Blackburn!

456
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,410
RPG!

457
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,090
Hold on!

458
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,250
No!

459
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,760
C-2, we got a man fallen.

460
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,860
Super-61, you're a sitting duck.

461
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,470
Take up overhead pattern to
provide sniper cover. Over.

462
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,980
Roger that. 61 coming out.

463
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,550
13, go ahead. I need you to
move to the north of the street.

464
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,380
Right to the north. Right there. Over.

465
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,450
Doc! Doc Schmid!

466
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,220
Come on!

467
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,990
Schmid, we got a man hit.

468
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,900
Where's he hit?
He's not. He fell.

469
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,940
What?
He fell.

470
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,970
Why aren't you shooting?

471
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,010
We're not being shot at yet!

472
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,640
How can you tell?

473
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,410
A hiss means it's close.

474
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,920
A snap means...

475
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,950
Now they're shooting at us!

476
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:32,920
Galentine!

477
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:39,360
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

478
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:43,070
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25.
Come in. Over.

479
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,040
Blackburn, can you hear me?

480
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,370
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

481
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,110
I can't get him!

482
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,610
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

483
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,710
We need to get him out of here! Over.

484
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,880
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

485
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,150
We've got a man down! Over.

486
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,930
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

487
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,100
Man down!
Missed that, 25.

488
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,000
Fuck it.
Say again.

489
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,300
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

490
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,770
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

491
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,370
What did he say?

492
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,410
Super 61, we got a man
wounded on the ground.

493
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,190
Stretcher!
Get me a stretcher!

494
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,250
Come on. Stretcher.

495
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,790
Come on, come on!

496
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,250
Grab this end!

497
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,250
Let's go!

498
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,060
All right.
Go.

499
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,830
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.

500
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,700
Up to the humvees! Now!

501
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,430
Go! Go!

502
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,440
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!

503
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,980
Secure!
Let's move out!

504
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,250
Everybody up! Let's go!

505
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:04,820
Come on!

506
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,550
Let's go! Let's move!

507
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,250
Grimes, run!
All right.

508
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,000
C-2, this is Super 61,
beginning my orbit of the target area.

509
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,500
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.

510
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,840
Kilo 11, this is 61,
providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.

511
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,780
Kilo 64, green light.

512
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,420
Ready for extraction. Over.
Roger that. Will relay.

513
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,920
That's it. We got them.

514
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,490
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.

515
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:42,520
Roger that. There's the call.
Let's move out!

516
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,560
Let's move out!
Hold on.

517
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,280
How much longer?
Five minutes, sir.

518
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,950
What?
Five minutes.

519
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,650
Nothing takes five minutes!

520
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,600
What happened to him?

521
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,000
He fell! Missed the rope!
How'd he do that?

522
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,000
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!

523
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,340
Let's go! Let's move it!

524
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,670
Move, move! Come on! Move!

525
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,210
Get him in there!

526
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,770
Get ready to move!

527
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,340
Go! Everybody move! Move!

528
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,980
Get the fuck up!

529
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,550
Grimes! Come on!

530
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,120
Grimes! Grimes!

531
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,800
Fuck this!

532
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,160
Fuck!

533
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,060
Let's go.

534
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:29,860
Come on!

535
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:32,110
Go! Move it!

536
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,330
Move!

537
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,710
Romeo 64, I need to send out
three humvees with a casualty.

538
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,840
He looks real bad.
I need to evac now.

539
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,380
Roger that, Uniform 64.

540
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,140
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you.
Over.

541
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,780
Roger that.

542
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,450
I need extra security on these humvees!

543
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,620
I'll go. I'll take my team,
make sure they get back okay.

544
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:51,720
Do it.

545
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,020
Struecker, you're lead humvee.

546
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:02,300
First three vehicles mount up,
we're moving back to base.

547
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,900
Move out!

548
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,750
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?

549
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,090
I don't want to talk
about it now, Colonel!

550
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,530
I'm busy.

551
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,720
Sergeant Pilla's hit!

552
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,700
Christ, he's fucked up!

553
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,230
Is anyone hit?

554
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,140
Struecker, talk to me!

555
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,900
It's Sergeant Pilla!

556
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,900
What's his status?

557
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,270
What's his status?

558
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,210
He's dead.

559
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,540
He's dead.

560
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:17,200
Pilla's dead, sir.

561
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:24,490
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.

562
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,480
Roger that.

563
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,150
Get on that 50!

564
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,590
Someone get on that 50!

565
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,230
It's mine.

566
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,810
Three guys with RPGs,
coming up on your side now!

567
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,420
Stay with it!

568
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,090
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.

569
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,060
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.

570
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,900
You want to pull those
PCLs off-line or what?

571
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,400
Right, babe.

572
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,400
Come on.

573
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,750
61, going down.

574
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,180
61 going down.

575
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,690
61 is going down.

576
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,460
Super 61 is going down.

577
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,960
Super 61 is going down.

578
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,030
61 is going down.
I repeat, it's going down.

579
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,000
61's going down.

580
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:15,890
Hold on!

581
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,390
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.

582
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,890
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.

583
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,070
Super 61 is on the deck now.

584
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,670
Get an MH-six on site.
Check for survivors.

585
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,740
Send in the SAR bird.

586
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,710
I want ground forces to move and secure
a new perimeter around that crash site.

587
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,840
Can you guide the convoy in there?

588
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,040
Roger that.

589
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,450
Well, move quick.

590
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:06,020
The whole city will be
coming down on top of them.

591
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,690
Star 41, come inbound and see if
you can land at the crash site.

592
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:13,230
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.

593
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,040
We just lost the initiative.

594
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,250
25, this is 64. Over.

595
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,250
25. Over.

596
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,150
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.

597
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,880
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.

598
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,390
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.

599
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,360
Leave a security element in place.
Take the rest of your chalk to the crash.

600
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,800
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow.

601
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,500
25, do you read me? Over.

602
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,510
Galentine! Schmid!

603
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,770
Get Yurek.

604
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,280
Get Twombly.

605
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,850
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

606
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,820
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.

607
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,860
Hold this corner and then
exfil with the humvees.

608
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,890
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
Let's go.

609
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,490
How come I got to stay back here?

610
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,360
Because you're dependable.

611
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,800
All right...

612
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,830
Let's go!

613
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,980
I hate being dependable, man.

614
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,950
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing,
parallel west to your position.

615
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,330
Women and children among them. Over.

616
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:55,660
Hit the wall.

617
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,680
Incoming!

618
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,790
Grenade!

619
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,070
Go.

620
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,920
We still got guys inside!

621
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,720
I'll go to the crash.

622
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:56,730
You take the rest of the team.
I'll finish loading the prisoners.

623
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,230
No! We'll go to the crash site together.

624
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,530
Secure the perimeter,
wait for the humvees.

625
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,430
Roger that.
Follow my lead.

626
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,100
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

627
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,840
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving soon.

628
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,510
All right, we need to move out now!

629
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,810
I'll finish loading the prisoners
and pick you up at the crash site!

630
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,110
Let's move out!

631
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:19,580
Moving out! Go!

632
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,700
Get in! Get in!

633
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,160
Move!

634
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,140
Eight o'clock!

635
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:01,430
Grimes, stay away from the walls.

636
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,680
Grimes. You okay?

637
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,280
Yeah!

638
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,720
Let's go, Maddox.

639
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,520
C-2, convoy's moving out.
Roger that.

640
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:29,320
Maddox, look at these jerks!
These idiots!

641
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,120
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

642
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,190
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

643
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,370
Hey, Twombly!

644
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,200
What?

645
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,900
I think they've forgotten us.
What?

646
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,600
It doesn't matter.

647
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:05,090
63 confirm. Skinnies are moving in on all sides.
They need help now.

648
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,160
Indigenous personnel advancing
to Wolcott crash site.

649
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,830
Say again. Over.

650
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,200
A lot of people closing in.

651
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:20,100
How far is Chalk Four
from the crash site?

652
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:23,440
Six blocks, sir.
They need to haul ass.

653
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,170
Get down! Get down!

654
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:21,970
Scotty, are you okay?

655
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,480
No, don't go back!

656
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,250
Get down! Get down!

657
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,960
Technicals!

658
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:42,780
Got them!

659
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,800
Six o'clock! Move, move!

660
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,820
Go, go, go!

661
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,590
Go, go!

662
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,410
Come on!

663
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,610
Yurek, leaving!

664
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:41,750
Come on!

665
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:12,840
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.

666
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,410
Romeo 64, I need to know before
I get to the goddamn street!

667
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,210
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

668
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:25,020
From the time directions are relayed
from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

669
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,130
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!

670
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,990
We can't slow down!

671
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:33,930
Danny, I'm getting information
from Orion surveillance above.

672
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,870
So get me my fucking
directions to the crash site!

673
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:40,970
Danny, hold on. I no longer have
the best view of your route.

674
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,740
Get your ass in the right place,
goddamn it!

675
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:47,210
What in the hell is the
status of Struecker's humvees?

676
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,250
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.

677
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,080
ETA to base momentarily.

678
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:01,360
Open the gate!

679
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,710
Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on.

680
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:29,830
Watch his head.

681
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,260
Easy.

682
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:41,930
Blackburn, can you hear me?
Get him to a medic.

683
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,970
Star 41 is at the crash site
to evacuate the injured. Over.

684
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,140
Roger that.

685
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:01,850
I got you.

686
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,620
Easy.

687
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,700
Galentine, you all right?

688
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:16,600
Galentine, Kurth, with me!
Cover fire, now.

689
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,300
Full cover!

690
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:34,120
How many are in there?

691
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:36,950
Two pilots are dead,
two crew chiefs are wounded!

692
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,650
He's hurt bad. We must get out of here.
All right. Go ahead.

693
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:16,690
26, this is 25.
Is that you shooting up the technicals?

694
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,360
This is 26. Roger that.

695
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:23,530
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

696
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:26,430
This is 26. Roger that.
Moving there now.

697
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,940
Move out!

698
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,080
Captain Steele, come in.

699
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,650
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

700
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:41,650
We got two wounded and we got both
the pilots dead in the chopper!

701
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:43,620
We need a medivac now!

702
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:49,430
It's too hot to land a bird.
You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

703
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,430
Where are the humvees?

704
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,470
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

705
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:57,660
They're encountering a lot of resistance.
64 out.

706
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:13,450
Get the 50 up!
You should see the crash directly ahead.

707
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,120
All I see is a roadblock!

708
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,690
I'll have to figure out another way.

709
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:48,190
Give me a defensive perimeter
so we can load the wounded.

710
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,040
Fire your weapon, Othic!

711
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:25,260
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

712
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,160
Medic!

713
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,100
Hoo-ah!

714
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,900
Medic! Medic!

715
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:13,600
Joyce! Joyce!
Come on, help me pick him up!

716
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:19,420
Get us off this fucking street!
Where's the crash site? Say again.

717
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,750
Keep going straight 200 meters.

718
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,080
Roger that.

719
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:26,960
Let's go!

720
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,480
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!

721
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:50,310
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

722
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,820
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

723
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,550
What?

724
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,860
Were we supposed to go to them?

725
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:04,020
I thought they were coming to us.

726
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,830
I think we're supposed to go to them.
Shit.

727
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,730
Let's go to the crash site.

728
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,800
Okay.

729
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:18,410
Don't fire that thing so close to my head.
I can barely hear as it is.

730
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,470
Move out.

731
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,190
Shit! Get down!

732
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:39,820
What did I just tell you?
If you do that again...

733
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,200
You okay? Nelson.

734
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,170
You all right?

735
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,840
Search and rescue bird on station
inserting medics.

736
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,650
Go!

737
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:11,620
Go, go!

738
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,460
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68.
We've been hit.

739
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,970
Super 68, there is smoke coming
from the top of your rotor.

740
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,300
Advise you to come out now.
Roger.

741
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:25,210
Dropping last man.

742
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:32,050
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12:00.
Can you see them?

743
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,480
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

744
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:45,830
68 coming out.

745
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,200
Super 68 is out. Over.

746
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,680
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

747
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,780
Both pilots are dead.

748
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:08,720
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

749
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,720
We'll kill them just carrying them.

750
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,190
Stabilize in here?
Roger.

751
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,690
Stabilize in the bird.
Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.

752
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,890
Understood, Wilkie.
We got you covered. Over.

753
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:22,460
Super 64, come inbound and
take Wolcott's position.

754
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:25,740
Roger. 64 is inbound.

755
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,500
Super 64, you all right?

756
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,370
This is Super 64. We're good.

757
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:00,440
You sure?
You look like you got clipped pretty good.

758
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,640
Instrument panels are okay.

759
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:06,780
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration
in the pedals, but we're good.

760
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:11,990
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64.
Have it checked out just to be safe.

761
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:13,450
Roger.

762
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:20,290
I'm getting movement in these pedals.
Check the systems again.

763
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,970
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

764
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,850
64 is going down!

765
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,510
64 is going in hard.

766
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,090
64 going down.

767
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,860
We're going down.

768
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,740
Get Struecker's column back out there.

769
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,100
They need to get to
Durant's crash site fast.

770
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:04,800
Another bird down.
I want them out of there.

771
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:06,480
All of them.

772
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,950
Captain Steele, we got to
move or we'll get pinned down!

773
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,210
We're moving as fast as we can.

774
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,490
You let me do my job and you do yours.
Over.

775
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,630
Fuck! Fuck!
Ruiz stay down.

776
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,860
I fucking knew...
Medic.

777
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:35,710
Fuck this! Captain Steele,
I'll take out the threat in the window.

778
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,240
We'll rally at the gray building.
Coming through.

779
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,840
Sarg'nt!

780
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,240
All right, let's move!

781
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:47,380
Cover me!

782
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,890
Let's go, let's move!
Moving out.

783
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,130
Friendly!

784
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,930
Friendlies coming through!

785
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,370
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

786
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:08,510
Come on, come on!

787
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,030
Come on!

788
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,410
Move up! Go! Move up!

789
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:21,550
What the fuck are you doing out there?

790
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,320
Doing my job!
We got to get to that crash site!

791
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,460
We got to get on that street,
and we got to move!

792
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,990
And you have got to keep up, sir!

793
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,330
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

794
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,870
We are combat ineffective, understand?

795
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:36,990
We got too many wounded to move!

796
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:40,300
Then give me some shooters
and I'll circle us to the bird.

797
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,500
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

798
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,700
Yes, sir!

799
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,350
All right, hook up with Delta!
Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

800
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,180
The rest of you, secure this position!

801
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:55,620
Treat the wounded,
we'll wait for the convoy!

802
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:58,220
Then we'll rally at
the crash site. Roger!

803
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,790
My guys, let's go!

804
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:33,720
C-2, I have two Delta snipers,
Shughart and Gordon...

805
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,490
Volunteering to secure crash site two.
Over.

806
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:41,300
No, Super 62, negative that request.
Can't risk another bird.

807
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:47,080
We don't see anything moving down there,
we don't even know if anyone's alive.

808
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,080
A ground team is being
organized to go in now.

809
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,980
ETA on ground team? Over.

810
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:56,240
Unknown, not long.

811
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:58,750
Do what you can from the air.

812
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,520
All right, gather around!

813
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,890
Durant's 64 is down.
We're going back in to get him!

814
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,090
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

815
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:12,570
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

816
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,000
We're wasting time here.

817
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:18,200
Refit and max out ammo and grenades,
you got five!

818
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,270
Sizemore, where are you going?

819
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,180
With you guys.
Not with that cast on you're not.

820
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,350
All right, all right, all right.
Go get your k-pot.

821
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:31,820
Talk to me.

822
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,490
I can't go back out there.

823
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:38,120
Thomas, everyone feels the
same way you do. All right?

824
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:41,530
It's what you do right now
that makes a difference.

825
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:44,060
It's your call.

826
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,560
Hoo-ah?

827
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:52,970
Hoo-ah.

828
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:12,960
It'll probably help to wash
the blood out of the humvees.

829
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:23,870
Sergeant Struecker!

830
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:27,880
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

831
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,210
You got some ammo?
Roger, Sarge!

832
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,980
Hop in!

833
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,370
Wait!

834
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,470
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

835
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:19,430
Which way?

836
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,430
That way, I think!
Not so fucking loud.

837
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:02,540
Nice donkey.

838
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,560
Rangers?

839
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:24,050
Who?

840
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,460
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

841
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,040
Fuck!

842
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,800
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

843
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,140
Come to us!
Fuck you, come to me.

844
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:49,920
Sorry, Sarge!

845
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:52,030
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

846
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:53,960
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

847
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:56,360
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

848
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:59,800
Because you said: "You won't need that,
we'll be back in a half-hour."

849
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:01,430
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

850
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,490
Nelson, cover this way.

851
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,470
We'll need night vision.

852
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:07,940
What's the matter with you?

853
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:11,080
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

854
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,650
We need to get out of here!
That way.

855
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,380
We can't be far from the crash.
Which way?

856
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:19,780
I thought you might know.

857
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,960
Let's move out.

858
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:30,090
Nelson, Twombly?
Come in. Over.

859
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:35,370
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine.
We need a position of the convoy. Over.

860
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,670
I can't raise them, Sergeant.

861
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:41,570
Sir, let's get the fuck
out of here and evac!

862
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:46,110
Let's move out.
Back to the stronghold!

863
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:47,340
Come on!

864
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:52,850
Ground forces have occupied several
buildings along Marehan Road...

865
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,620
But they're all spread out.

866
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:59,130
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a
perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.

867
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,700
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

868
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:06,000
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers,
are here, a couple blocks away.

869
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:07,590
They're banged up pretty bad.

870
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:12,540
He set up a casualty collection point,
I don't think they'll be able to move.

871
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,270
Sergeant Sanderson and
a small Delta team...

872
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:19,210
Are moving from Steele's position
to the crash site as we speak.

873
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:31,390
Draw off fire!

874
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,520
When this asshole stops
to reload, cover me!

875
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:36,170
Go!
Sir.

876
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:40,640
Again!

877
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:47,210
Loading!

878
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:51,070
Keep going!

879
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:53,550
I'm jammed!

880
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,190
I got it!

881
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,190
No, shit!

882
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,030
RPG!

883
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:30,550
You all right? You okay?

884
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,690
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

885
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:37,520
Come on! Come on!

886
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:40,250
Go!

887
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:50,440
A crowd is advancing six,
seven blocks from the crash.

888
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:52,840
Shughart and Gordon again
request permission...

889
01:23:52,910 --> 01:23:56,350
To secure until convoy arrives. Over.

890
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:59,610
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

891
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:03,310
From where they are,
they can see things clearer than any of us.

892
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:05,320
They know what they're asking.

893
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:06,990
Let me talk to them.

894
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:08,290
This is Garrison.

895
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:12,630
I want to make sure that you understand
what you're asking, so say it out loud.

896
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:18,690
We're asking to go in and set up a
perimeter until ground support arrives.

897
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:23,200
You realize that I cannot tell you when
that might be, it could take a while.

898
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:26,640
Roger that.
You still want to go in there?

899
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:27,780
Yes, sir.

900
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:33,410
Colonel Harrell?
Yes, General?

901
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:34,550
It's your call.

902
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,210
Roger that.

903
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:41,190
Goffena, put them in.

904
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:56,870
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

905
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:03,040
RPG!

906
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:14,520
Set up your perimeter!

907
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:23,960
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

908
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,910
Othic, calm down, goddamn it!
There's live ordnance, now get out!

909
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:31,040
Son of a bitch.

910
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:35,710
All right, lift him up!
Lift him up! Easy, easy!

911
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:39,110
All right, get him in there! Good, good!
Easy, easy!

912
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,850
Get in that truck and drive.

913
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,980
But I'm shot, Colonel.
Everybody's shot.

914
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,150
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

915
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:50,720
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig,
then go straight.

916
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:55,230
McKnight, we need you to turn
around and head back to Hawlwadig.

917
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:57,670
You're shitting me!
We just came through there!

918
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,500
There must be a better route!

919
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:04,740
That's the info I'm getting from JOC,
you need to turn around and head back.

920
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:08,040
Roger that. Roger that.

921
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:11,390
I cannot believe this shit!
Turn us around, Maddox.

922
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:13,420
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

923
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:15,080
Just get it over with! Drive!

924
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,150
Goddamn!

925
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:18,760
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

926
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:27,900
Keep your foot on the gas!

927
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:30,200
Keep your foot on the gas!

928
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:42,780
Fuck!

929
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:46,710
Shit.

930
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,940
C-2, Shughart and Gordon
are on the deck. Over.

931
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:06,110
Roger.

932
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,760
Friendlies!

933
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,170
God, it's good to see you!

934
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,210
It's good to see you. How bad?

935
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,180
My leg's broken and my
back feels kind of weird.

936
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:44,410
We've got to get you out of here.

937
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,220
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

938
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,610
Wait, I...

939
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:01,430
I'm putting you down.

940
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:04,600
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site,
securing perimeter.

941
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:06,260
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.

942
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:07,770
You're locked and loaded.

943
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,570
Any skinnies come around these corners,
you watch our backs.

944
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:14,310
Where's the rescue squad?
We're it.

945
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:23,110
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

946
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,590
Son of a bitch.

947
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:28,560
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

948
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,490
I'm low on ammo,
I got many wounded including me...

949
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,530
Vehicles that are barely running.

950
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,540
Okay, Danny,
I need a no-BS assessment here.

951
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:39,100
Can you get to the crash site?

952
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,430
Colonel, I can't see shit.

953
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:47,410
Negative.

954
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,540
With the amount of wounded we have,
we'd do more harm than good.

955
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:54,580
We need to come back to base,
rearm and regroup and then we can go back out.

956
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:55,640
Roger.

957
01:28:57,490 --> 01:29:00,760
C-2, bring them back.
Get them out of there.

958
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:03,820
Roger. Return to base.

959
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,000
We're going home!

960
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,190
Let's go. Left.

961
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,420
Roger that. Understand.
Convoy returning to base.

962
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:31,780
What's up?
They're sending them back.

963
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,520
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

964
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,760
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

965
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:40,290
We need to exfil the wounded now and
get out of here before it's too late!

966
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,200
If Colonel McKnight went back to base,
then he had a good reason.

967
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:45,840
It changes nothing.

968
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:47,440
All right, listen up.

969
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:51,500
We're going to hold the perimeter and
we're going to hold the strongpoint.

970
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:55,550
Conserve your ammo.
Only shoot at what you can hit.

971
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:59,150
The convoy is going to come.

972
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,550
We're going to get home.

973
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,030
Loading!

974
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:24,840
Loading!

975
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:27,180
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

976
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,550
Loading!

977
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,700
Randy, last mag!

978
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:51,230
Gordy!

979
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:55,970
Fuck!

980
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,660
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

981
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:13,360
Good luck.

982
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,650
We need the 10th Mountain in there.
Everything they got.

983
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,850
Pakistanis, Malays,
I want their tanks and APCs.

984
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:42,890
They don't know we've gone in.

985
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,400
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here.
We're fighting the entire city.

986
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:52,560
I want every vehicle possible that's
got 4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

987
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:56,070
Once they've assembled, we'll move
our men out of the hostile area...

988
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:58,740
And back to the Pakistani Stadium,
the safe zone.

989
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:01,340
Now, let's go.
Roger that.

990
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:40,840
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

991
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,420
Stay with me.
You just got a bullet in the leg.

992
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,890
See where those tires are burning?
All that black smoke?

993
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,490
Roger. I can see it,
but I can't get there. Over.

994
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:03,760
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

995
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,090
Negative. You don't understand.

996
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:10,800
It's roadblock after roadblock.
You have to find us another route. Over.

997
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:15,070
There ain't one. The only other
route is all the way around the city.

998
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:16,240
Roger that.

999
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,800
Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.

1000
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:23,510
Request permission to move to
crash site number two on foot. Over.

1001
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,450
Green light, Kilo 11.

1002
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,920
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

1003
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:17,600
After I'm finished with this,
I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

1004
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,540
The usual. Blended, no salt.

1005
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:30,950
This is Kilo 12.
We've got to change our position. Over.

1006
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,470
Eversmann, come in.

1007
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:47,800
Eversmann.

1008
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,570
Roger, who is this?
Sanderson.

1009
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:57,080
Do not... I say again, do not fire
to the east. We are coming to you.

1010
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:59,680
Understood.

1011
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:02,390
DiTomasso and his men are
on the southeast corner.

1012
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:04,820
We need you on the northeast building.

1013
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:06,360
Roger. We'll take it.

1014
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,190
Watch out for skinnies.
They're on the rooftops.

1015
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,750
They're in prayer but
not for much longer.

1016
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,030
Hold your fire to the east.

1017
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:40,820
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

1018
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,600
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.

1019
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,760
We got the chopper in sight.
Where are you?

1020
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,130
We're on the southwest corner.
Where have you been? Are you okay?

1021
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,070
Yeah.

1022
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,770
Hold your fire. We're coming in.

1023
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:00,640
We got to go.

1024
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:03,650
Shawn, listen!
Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.

1025
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:07,780
When he gets across the street,
he'll turn around and cover you as you run.

1026
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:11,990
Listen closely. When you get there,
you'll turn around and cover me, okay?

1027
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:15,960
You won't just run to
Eversmann's position.

1028
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:18,860
You're going to stop and
you are going to cover me.

1029
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:21,530
It's important you understand that.

1030
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,370
Okay, you ready?

1031
01:38:24,170 --> 01:38:25,540
Yeah, I guess.

1032
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:32,670
Don't forget.
What?

1033
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:34,580
Don't forget.

1034
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:51,460
I got them in my sight, Sarg'nt.
They're coming up on the west gate.

1035
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:52,660
I see them.

1036
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,900
Let's move out.

1037
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,070
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

1038
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:02,640
We got you.

1039
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:11,280
Nelson!

1040
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:19,080
Fuck!

1041
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,590
Twombly!

1042
01:39:30,410 --> 01:39:31,530
Smith! No!

1043
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:32,940
You all right?

1044
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,640
Get it off of me!

1045
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:39,810
Get it off!

1046
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:42,750
Come on, man. Come on.

1047
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,860
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!

1048
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:56,560
My leg! My leg!

1049
01:39:56,630 --> 01:39:58,330
Come on, Jamie, I got you!

1050
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:07,430
Up, one, two, three.

1051
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:11,440
You're all right.
I need some pressure on this wound.

1052
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:12,570
My right thigh!

1053
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:14,340
Pressure, yeah.

1054
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,850
Are my balls okay?
You still have your balls.

1055
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,010
I need more men in here.

1056
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:20,680
Twombly! Nelson!

1057
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,820
Put him down.
Oh, man, that really...

1058
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,390
It really hurts!
Direct pressure on that.

1059
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:28,960
It's okay, it's okay.

1060
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:31,900
Let me see it!
All right.

1061
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:34,630
All right, let me get a look at that.

1062
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,440
Oh, shit!

1063
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:37,870
Oh, fuck!

1064
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:40,480
What the fuck was that?
It's all right.

1065
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:42,710
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

1066
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,180
Fuck. Galentine!

1067
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:45,370
It's all right.

1068
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:47,250
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

1069
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:51,210
Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing?
Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1070
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:55,160
They're not going to come and get us.
They're not going to come for us.

1071
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:58,320
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt.
I need you to focus.

1072
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,800
Can you do that?
Juliet 64, come in. Over.

1073
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:02,770
Now, can you hold your weapon?

1074
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,120
Yes, sir.

1075
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:08,360
Anybody comes through that door gets
two in the chest and one in the head.

1076
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:12,140
You understand?
I'm still in the fight, sir.

1077
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:15,350
Captain Steele,
I need a medivac in here now!

1078
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:18,040
Corporal Smith has been hit!
Hold on, 25.

1079
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:19,820
Still in the fight.

1080
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:21,350
He's hurt pretty bad.

1081
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:25,150
25, we got wounded too. You'll have
to maintain your situation, over.

1082
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:27,780
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour,
he's in trouble!

1083
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,650
C-2, this is 64.

1084
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:35,100
Requesting a medivac for a critically
wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

1085
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:38,040
Command, Chalk Four
is requesting medivac.

1086
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,570
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

1087
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:45,910
Captain, we cannot send in medivac
at this time. Sit tight. Over.

1088
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:50,080
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac.
It's not possible.

1089
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:54,050
JOC cannot risk another bird.
You'll just have to hold on.

1090
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:02,060
All right. I got him.

1091
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:04,560
I want direct pressure on the wound.

1092
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:08,230
It's going to be all right.

1093
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:50,180
I think this is mine!

1094
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:55,940
This is Kilo 11.
I'm at the Durant crash site.

1095
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:57,550
Roger that.

1096
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,900
Crash site two secured.

1097
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:23,510
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

1098
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:24,880
Cribbs?

1099
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,180
They're still debating the route.
How long?

1100
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:30,940
At least a couple of hours.

1101
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,780
We haven't got that long, Joe.

1102
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:37,450
Pakistani General says, since we didn't
deign to inform him of the raid...

1103
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:41,490
It'll take some time to mobilize
the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

1104
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:43,560
You tell the general this:

1105
01:43:43,770 --> 01:43:46,670
I understand, but it is
my duty to remind him...

1106
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:50,930
That my men are surrounded by
thousands of armed Somali militia.

1107
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:56,410
It's imperative that we move them out of
the hostile area and into the safe zone.

1108
01:43:56,610 --> 01:43:58,140
I need his help now.

1109
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:00,380
Yes, sir.

1110
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:06,720
Durant.

1111
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:09,890
Michael Durant.

1112
01:44:10,630 --> 01:44:11,620
Yes.

1113
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:14,500
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

1114
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:18,100
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

1115
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:23,340
That's right.

1116
01:44:24,010 --> 01:44:27,000
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

1117
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:34,840
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

1118
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,590
What do you want with me?

1119
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:41,150
You have taken hostages.

1120
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,750
We have you.

1121
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:47,050
My government will
never negotiate for me.

1122
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:52,160
Then perhaps you and
I can negotiate, huh?

1123
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:56,160
Soldier to soldier.

1124
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:03,910
I'm not in charge.

1125
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:11,620
Course not. You have the power to kill,
but not negotiate.

1126
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:14,990
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

1127
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,930
Do you really think if
you get General Aidid...

1128
01:45:20,130 --> 01:45:23,500
We will simply put down our weapons...

1129
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:26,630
And adopt American democracy?

1130
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:28,870
That the killing will stop?

1131
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:33,340
We know this:
Without victory, there can be no peace.

1132
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:36,550
There will always be killing, you see?

1133
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:39,210
This is how things are in our world.

1134
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:55,730
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1135
01:45:57,870 --> 01:46:01,310
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

1136
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:06,910
You got to take over from me.
Both hands.

1137
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:17,850
It's the femoral artery,
but I can't see it.

1138
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:21,520
Which means that it's
retracted up into the pelvis.

1139
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:26,030
I have to find it and clamp it.
It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1140
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:28,330
I got no more IVs.

1141
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,500
So, I'm going to need
you to assist. Okay?

1142
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,270
Yeah, yeah.

1143
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:38,580
Now listen, Jamie.
I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

1144
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:43,540
I got to cause you more pain,
but I have to do it to help you.

1145
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:45,270
All right, you understand?

1146
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:47,340
Morphine.
I can't.

1147
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:50,150
It'll lower your heart rate too far.
I'm sorry.

1148
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:52,520
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

1149
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:59,970
Hold the wound open,
keep pressure on the top of the leg.

1150
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:02,230
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

1151
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:03,760
On my count.

1152
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,830
All right, Jamie. All right.

1153
01:47:08,110 --> 01:47:10,270
One. Two.

1154
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:12,270
Three.

1155
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:22,420
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

1156
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:24,420
I feel the pulse.

1157
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:27,320
I got it. I got it.

1158
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:28,990
I got it, yeah. I got it.

1159
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,660
I got it.
You got it?

1160
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:32,090
Clamp?

1161
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,870
I got it clamped.

1162
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,200
Hold it.
Got it.

1163
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:38,530
Here, grab it.

1164
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:40,940
It's tearing.
I got it.

1165
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:43,040
Doc, it's going back in!
Hold it!

1166
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:44,340
It's tearing!

1167
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:47,650
Okay. Get out. Hold the wound.
Okay, I'm holding.

1168
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,180
Move your hand.

1169
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:02,620
What?

1170
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:22,740
Fix it?

1171
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:28,790
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

1172
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:46,240
What the hell are you doing?

1173
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:50,710
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

1174
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:53,580
Grimesy, you are squared away.

1175
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:13,860
Sarg'nt, how would you
like a nice hot cup of Joe?

1176
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:17,260
Gold Coast blend.

1177
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:20,410
Sit down.
I want to take a look at that foot.

1178
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:23,100
No, it's not a problem.
Come on.

1179
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:32,650
Where the hell did they find you?
Behind a desk.

1180
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:37,180
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

1181
01:49:40,870 --> 01:49:42,660
Is anybody hit?
We're good!

1182
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,200
You all right?

1183
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:50,260
Yeah!

1184
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,940
Is everybody all right?

1185
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:53,030
Yeah!

1186
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:08,250
Incoming!

1187
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,370
Keep firing... Faster!

1188
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:15,820
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

1189
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:51,030
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

1190
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:54,330
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast
corner of the crash. Who's this?

1191
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,390
This is Hoot.
I'm coming with three friendlies.

1192
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:58,130
I need cover fire. Over.

1193
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:01,140
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire!
Deltas coming in.

1194
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:03,230
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1195
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:12,580
Ground personnel will have to mark
target positions with infrared strobes.

1196
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:17,020
Get little birds on strafing runs
and keep them going all night long.

1197
01:52:17,130 --> 01:52:19,390
If we don't hold back this city...

1198
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:23,090
We'll have a 100 caskets
to fill by morning.

1199
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,530
Yes, sir.

1200
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:27,500
Colonel Harrell, ground
personnel at crash site one...

1201
01:52:27,570 --> 01:52:32,060
Will have to mark the target with
infrared strobes to prep for air strike.

1202
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:38,570
McKnight.

1203
01:52:42,650 --> 01:52:46,250
Between the 10th Mountain and UN,
we got enough personnel, okay?

1204
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:50,390
Danny, you guys do not
have to go back out again.

1205
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:13,110
I can't die here, man.

1206
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:18,380
You're not going to die, all right?
You're not going to die.

1207
01:53:19,290 --> 01:53:20,760
I'm sorry.

1208
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:24,220
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

1209
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:27,560
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

1210
01:53:28,770 --> 01:53:30,230
You okay, Twombs?

1211
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,630
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

1212
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:36,170
You did what you were trained to do.

1213
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:38,970
You should be proud of that.

1214
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,410
Be proud of that.

1215
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:46,110
Ev?
Yeah.

1216
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:49,420
Do me a favor.

1217
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:57,430
You tell my parents
that I fought well today.

1218
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:06,730
And that I fought hard.

1219
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:11,170
You're going to tell
them yourself, okay?

1220
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:12,570
Do you hear me?

1221
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,440
All right?

1222
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:20,710
Are the humvees here?
They're coming, Jamie.

1223
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:23,050
They're coming.

1224
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:25,490
You just got to hang
in there a little bit.

1225
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:28,050
You hold on for just a little bit.
I can.

1226
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:29,390
I can.

1227
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:32,230
It's nothing.

1228
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:34,900
It's nothing.

1229
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:37,060
It's nothing.

1230
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:39,470
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

1231
01:54:40,410 --> 01:54:41,570
Nothing.

1232
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:50,240
Oh, shit.

1233
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:52,580
Hold the wound.

1234
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:20,910
Doc.

1235
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:24,810
Doc.

1236
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,230
It's okay.

1237
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:11,330
What are you doing?

1238
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:16,430
We need the ammo.

1239
01:56:24,710 --> 01:56:26,510
You did all you could here.

1240
01:56:27,050 --> 01:56:29,280
They should've sent a medivac.

1241
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:33,450
Right now we'd be out there
defending another crashed chopper.

1242
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:36,210
More men would get torn up.

1243
01:56:39,230 --> 01:56:40,560
Maybe.

1244
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:43,930
See, you're thinking. Don't.

1245
01:56:44,030 --> 01:56:47,060
Because, Sergeant, you can't
control who gets hit or who doesn't.

1246
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:49,900
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

1247
01:56:50,110 --> 01:56:52,730
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

1248
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:56,730
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

1249
01:56:58,410 --> 01:57:03,010
This all happened because Blackburn fell.
Should have, could have, don't matter.

1250
01:57:03,190 --> 01:57:06,950
You'll get plenty of time to think
about all that later. Believe me.

1251
01:57:10,730 --> 01:57:13,850
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

1252
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:16,390
You did it right today.

1253
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:20,060
You need to start thinking about
getting these men out of here.

1254
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,380
Well, shall we?

1255
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:40,210
I need four guys in this corner now!

1256
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,990
RPG!

1257
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:54,390
This is Barber 52 in
position for gun run.

1258
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:56,600
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

1259
01:57:57,310 --> 01:58:00,330
This is 25! I can see you.
You're right above me.

1260
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:03,950
Eversmann, I can't tell who's
who down there. Too much activity.

1261
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:06,510
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

1262
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:07,910
Roger that.

1263
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:20,860
You see it?

1264
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,790
Nah, I can't see shit.

1265
01:58:25,770 --> 01:58:28,640
I'm putting it on the roof.
You're going to need help!

1266
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:29,690
Cover me.

1267
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:34,670
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down
some cover fire for him on three!

1268
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:35,870
Ready?

1269
01:58:36,050 --> 01:58:37,040
One.

1270
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,210
Two.

1271
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:40,110
Three. Go!

1272
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:16,120
I got your position. I got the target.
We're inbound and hot.

1273
01:59:40,710 --> 01:59:45,380
C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission
to return to base. Rearm. Over.

1274
01:59:45,550 --> 01:59:48,380
Roger that. Second team inbound.
Your station.

1275
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:50,750
On your location, four minutes.

1276
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:01,960
All right, they're here.
Get the wounded ready to move.

1277
02:00:02,430 --> 02:00:04,870
Lay down some cover fire!

1278
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:09,300
I thought I heard a noise out here!

1279
02:00:09,380 --> 02:00:12,110
Load up. We're getting out of here.
Yes, sir.

1280
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:20,020
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here
and will be with you in about 5 minutes.

1281
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:21,950
Prepare your men for exfil.

1282
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:24,510
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

1283
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:29,020
Five minutes! The convoy is
going to be here in five minutes!

1284
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:51,250
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

1285
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:52,750
My last one!

1286
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:05,090
The convoy is here!

1287
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:27,180
Sergeant Eversmann.
I heard you guys needed a lift!

1288
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:29,080
Yes, sir!

1289
02:01:29,290 --> 02:01:31,890
Bring your wounded and
start loading them up!

1290
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:41,230
Hey, I got you. I got you.

1291
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:44,170
It's okay. I want to walk.

1292
02:01:44,710 --> 02:01:47,770
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!

1293
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:58,040
Move!

1294
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:04,660
We get the pilots' bodies out,
and then we go to the stadium.

1295
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:07,130
We're running out of room around here.

1296
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,160
Cram into every possible space.

1297
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,990
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security
for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

1298
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:16,690
10th Mountain? No.

1299
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:20,000
Sir, with respect, my Rangers
can provide rear security.

1300
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:24,340
We'll walk you out of the hot zone,
then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

1301
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:26,610
Okay, let's get out of here.

1302
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,880
Let's go.

1303
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:30,580
All right, you got him?
Yeah, come on.

1304
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:33,890
Come on!

1305
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:38,020
These things are fucking bullet magnets.
Come on, let's go!

1306
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:40,530
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

1307
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:44,590
Careful.

1308
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:47,400
Easy. Go easy.

1309
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:52,170
Easy.

1310
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:04,920
Colonel, what is going on down there?

1311
02:03:04,990 --> 02:03:08,190
They're dismantling the
entire cockpit around the body.

1312
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:12,060
How long is it going to take?
I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

1313
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,360
They can't say!

1314
02:03:16,330 --> 02:03:17,560
Danny...

1315
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:20,870
No one gets left behind.

1316
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:23,400
You understand me, son?

1317
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:25,340
Yes, General.

1318
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:27,640
Do what you have to do.

1319
02:03:29,010 --> 02:03:30,280
Roger.

1320
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:39,150
Come on. Bring him through.
I got him.

1321
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:43,190
Get all his gear. Get the wounded out.
Got you, sir!

1322
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,200
Move!
Got you!

1323
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:52,890
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

1324
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:03,970
Fuck!

1325
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:08,150
Fire in the hole!

1326
02:04:08,350 --> 02:04:10,190
Let's go! Move!
Let's go!

1327
02:04:20,730 --> 02:04:24,130
Open the hatch! We got men back here!
No room here! Go on the roof!

1328
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:25,300
What's going on?

1329
02:04:25,370 --> 02:04:28,360
The roof?
I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

1330
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:30,740
No, no, it's full.

1331
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:35,440
We're running out. Keep moving.
Use the vehicles as cover.

1332
02:04:37,850 --> 02:04:39,910
Move it! Let's go!

1333
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:59,360
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

1334
02:05:01,370 --> 02:05:02,740
Move!
Go! Move!

1335
02:05:02,980 --> 02:05:04,340
Go!

1336
02:05:58,930 --> 02:06:01,370
Get down! Get down!

1337
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:03,870
Get down, lady!

1338
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:07,740
I'm out of ammo!

1339
02:06:09,110 --> 02:06:11,100
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

1340
02:06:16,120 --> 02:06:17,710
Don't you do it.

1341
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:20,810
What are you doing?
Don't you damn do it.

1342
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:23,990
Kurth, let's go!

1343
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:49,330
Easy.

1344
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:40,990
Ah, shit.

1345
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:44,720
Bullet missed your jugular by
about three millimeters. Don't move.

1346
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:48,420
Hurry up, hurry up.

1347
02:09:51,810 --> 02:09:55,800
Little short on coffee,
but I got you some tea.

1348
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:01,710
How you doing, soldier?

1349
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,780
Can't feel a thing.

1350
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:16,450
Take his pulse.

1351
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,200
Hey, Sarg'nt.

1352
02:10:55,770 --> 02:10:56,760
Captain.

1353
02:10:56,940 --> 02:10:59,930
Lorenzo. How you doing?

1354
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:07,380
It went in and out, so the medic said
I should be okay in a couple of days.

1355
02:11:07,550 --> 02:11:09,240
That's great news.

1356
02:11:09,850 --> 02:11:11,550
Are we going after them?

1357
02:11:11,650 --> 02:11:14,380
You bet your ass we will.
We got to regroup.

1358
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:17,890
Don't go out there without me.

1359
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:22,390
Don't go back out there without me.

1360
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:25,030
I can still do my job.

1361
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:29,430
You get some rest now, okay?

1362
02:11:44,590 --> 02:11:45,990
You're going back in?

1363
02:11:48,090 --> 02:11:49,920
There are still men out there.

1364
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:53,890
Goddamn.

1365
02:11:59,070 --> 02:12:00,370
When I go home...

1366
02:12:01,370 --> 02:12:02,860
And people ask me:

1367
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:06,370
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

1368
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:10,780
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

1369
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:14,020
I won't say a goddamn word.

1370
02:12:14,350 --> 02:12:15,580
Why?

1371
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:18,050
They won't understand.

1372
02:12:19,790 --> 02:12:22,090
They won't understand why we do it.

1373
02:12:23,590 --> 02:12:27,720
They won't understand it's
about the men next to you.

1374
02:12:29,570 --> 02:12:30,900
And that's it.

1375
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:34,400
That's all it is.

1376
02:12:44,750 --> 02:12:49,120
Don't even think about it, all right?
I'm better on my own.

1377
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:57,250
We started a whole new week.
It's Monday.

1378
02:13:10,110 --> 02:13:12,270
I was talking to
Blackburn the other day...

1379
02:13:12,340 --> 02:13:17,040
And he asked me, "What changed?
Why are we going home?"

1380
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:20,920
And I said, "Nothing."

1381
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:25,060
But that's not true, you know.
I think everything's changed.

1382
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:27,950
I know I've changed.

1383
02:13:33,730 --> 02:13:36,430
A friend of mine asked
me before I got here...

1384
02:13:36,570 --> 02:13:38,830
It was when we were all shipping out.

1385
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:40,460
He asked me:

1386
02:13:41,740 --> 02:13:44,470
"Why are you going to
fight somebody else's war?

1387
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:47,610
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

1388
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:52,980
I didn't know what to say at the time...

1389
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:58,320
But if he asked me again, I'd say no.

1390
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:02,920
I'd say there's no way in hell.

1391
02:14:04,030 --> 02:14:06,060
Nobody asks to be a hero.

1392
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:13,670
It just sometimes turns out that way.

1393
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:20,700
I'll talk to your ma and
pa when I get home, okay?

1394
02:15:04,290 --> 02:15:07,990
My love, you are strong and
you will do well in life.

1395
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:11,500
I love you and my children deeply.

1396
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:15,890
Today and tomorrow,
let each day grow and grow.

1397
02:15:17,110 --> 02:15:21,270
Keep smiling and never give up,
even when things get you down.

1398
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:25,010
So, in closing, my love...

1399
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:29,210
Tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

1400
02:15:29,650 --> 02:15:34,250
Tell them I love them.
Then hug them for me...

1401
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:37,290
And give them both a
kiss good night for Daddy.
