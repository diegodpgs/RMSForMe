Well, you know,
I was talking to Denise...

159
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,680
...and Denise feels that
you might be someone...

160
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,525
...who could make
Rachel feel better.

161
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,649
Yeah, but like I said,

162
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,721
we're not really friends, so...

163
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,803
Just give Rachel a call.

want me to say?

That's not gonna work.

She'll think
you're being sarcastic.

Are you telling me you can't do

one nice thing
for another person?

172

I mean, honestly, is that
really what's happening here?

173
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,810
Fine. Okay.

174

Just, please don't
go through my stuff.

175

Or I'll start going through
your stuff.

is to lie around the house

any favors here.

we hung out

out of each other's lives.

Is that a Black Power salute?

301
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,490
No, I was going in
for a fist bump.

302
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,801
I can't fist bump you
from up here.

Nice.

306
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,441

There's a lot of pillows
in here.

312

Mmm-hmm.

313
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,526
Seriously, like, how many...
how many pillows is that?

314
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,880
I don't know.

315
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,682
I wish I had
that many pillows.

316

So, ask your parents for some.

317
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,210
No, they'd be suspicious
or something.

318
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,282
What, that you'd sleep
all the time?

319
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,124

00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,561
We were stuck in there
for, like, 25 minutes...

794
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,926
...and we had to breathe
the weird marijuana air.

quite an adventure.

You was the girl who called
Justin Jones perverted...

...for showing girls
the birthmark on his butt.

819
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,683
showed you his butt.
You were calm.

820

show their butts."

his friend. Dude's got issues.

EARL: Man, I don't even know.
It might be his folks.

830

I mean, dude's mom
always tellin' him

831
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,489
how handsome he is,
which he ain't.

832
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,484
So now he think he can't trust
anybody close to him.

833
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,766
Dude's weird-ass dad

don't socialize with anybody
'cept the cat.

835

So that's a role model
ain't got no friends.

836
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,610
Bottom line, dude's terrified

837
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,330
of callin' somebody
his friend...

838
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,687
...and they sayin', "Hey, bro,
I'm not your friend."

839
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,120
Then he'd have to kill himself.

Well, we never told
anybody 'bout them.

They suck.
I mean, they're terrible.

a box of tulips.

to tie your shoe</i>

1106
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:48,645
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

1107
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,642
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

1108
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,647
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

1109
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,683
GREG: So,
if we make this film,

1110
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,841
people are gonna be, like:

1111
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,281
"Oh, Greg and Earl,

1112
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,850
"they're those weird filmmakers.

1113
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,684
"They're always
creepily filming stuff.

1114
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,410
"They'll probably sneak into
your house one night

1115
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,726
"and film you
while you're sleeping."

1116
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,205
But people probably
already think that,

1117
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,281
'cause you gave Rachel
those stupid films.

1118
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,361
(MUFFLED)
This is nasty as hell.

1119
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,124
GREG: So now, I've become
completely conspicuous,

1120
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,361
like all the time.

1121
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,726
People look at me and think,

1122
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,966
"Filmmaker."
The hell even is this?

1123
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,081
When they're not
already thinking,

1124
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,240
"Cancer girl's boyfriend."

1125
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,566
It tastes like a dog's
funky-ass butthole.

1126
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,841
Furthermore,
we agreed to do a film

1127
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,570
that we have no idea
what it should look like...

1128
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,529
...or sound like, or even be.

1129
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,806
I mean,
what the hell sort of film

1130
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,962
should we even make? Huh?

1131
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,849
I mean, what was I thinking?

1132
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,046
EARL: You were thinking
that girl Madison

1133
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,246
had nice titties.

1134
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,600
I mean,
I like the titties too,

1135
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,290
but now you got a problem.

1136
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,964
'Cause I ain't agreed
to do this shit.

1137
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,087
You did.

1138
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,728
Are you not gonna
help me make this?

1139
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,529
The hell we gonna make, son?

1140
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,080
GREG'S DAD:
<i>They want fresh inspiration.</i>

1141
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,800
I must tell you,
the richest inspiration

1142
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,450
I have ever known was...

1143
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,887
...during my period of
quarantine in the Amazon.

1144
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,371
(THEME FROM THE CONVERSATION
PLAYING ON HEADPHONES)

1145
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,124
Where I
and a half dozen other...

1146
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,402
...unfortunates
had nothing to watch...

1147
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,281
...but the bristling,
leviathan tarantula...

1148
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,569
...bunched up on
the rotting, flimsy thatch...

1149
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,762
...perhaps eight feet
above our faces.

1150
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,085
Spiders the size of your fist.

1151
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,766
Their fangs glistening
with venom and...

1152
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,649
...their thousand-fold
black eyes

1153
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,967
shining dully in the gloom.

1154
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,406
In the darkness,
you would hear

1155
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,925
the sudden anguished hiss...

1156
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,163
...of a spider being struck
by an adult leopard wasp...

1157
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,486
...and in their
mortal struggle,

1158
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,920
they would plummet
to one's bed...

1159
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,970
...biting and stinging
and thrashing...

1160
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,682
You know that you can
smoke a hornet?

1161
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,321
GREG: Okay, so just look at me
when you answer the questions.

1162
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,681
Don't worry
about the camera, all right?

1163
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,524
Okay, Denise.

1164
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,443
Tell me a little
about Rachel's birth.

1165
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,169
Uh, Rachel's birth.

1166
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,204
What an ordeal that was.

1167
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,281
(CHUCKLES)

1168
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,444
Greg, just...
let me tell you one thing.

1169
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,170
I was a really good mom
to her, you know?

1170
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,805
I really was.

1171
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,321
Some single moms,
their kids grow up too fast...

1172
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,164
...but I always tried to
protect Rachel from that.

1173
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,846
I did my very best
to protect her from...

1174
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,483
...growing up too quickly,
you know?

1175
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,321
Right.

1176
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,641
And now, I'm learning
that there are...

1177
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,481
...there are just
some things that you can't

1178
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,608
protect your kid from,
you know?

1179
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,401
No matter what you do,
you just...

1180
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,645
So, did she have
any favorite toys?

1181
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,322
Before I answer that question,
this is serious...

1182
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,771
...so use your ears
and listen to me.

1183
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,251
I want you
to promise me something

1184
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,651
as I care about you.

1185
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,529
You gotta promise me you're
not gonna have a baby...

1186
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,607
...unless you're
ready to love

1187
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,120
that baby's mother
your whole life...

1188
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,161
...and this is serious.

1189
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,642
I'm telling you something
that nobody's gonna tell you.

1190
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,122
Don't pick a girl
who's push-pull, you know?

1191
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,931
You wanna pick somebody
who's gonna love you...

1192
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,841
...and not forget you,
and not...

1193
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,169
...leave you for someone
with a big, fat ass.

1194
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,683
So, no favorite toy.

1195
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,281
DENISE: Um...

1196
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,281
Oh, you want to know what?
Here's a favorite toy.

1197
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,361
Scissors.

1198
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,363
When Rachel's father
first left...

1199
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,045
...she gathered up
all his books,

1200
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,121
favorite old books...

1201
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,885
...and she rounded 'em up
and she cut them right up.

1202
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,126
Please, don't tell her
I'm telling you,

1203
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,565
she would chop my head off.

1204
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,405
But she just...
(IMITATES SCISSORS)

1205
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,209
And I was, like,
"Atta girl."

1206
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,563
Snip, snip, snip.
She was very mad.

1207
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,961
Can we take a little break
and have a little taste?

1208
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,565
You boys are old enough
to have a little taste, right?

1209
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,251
Can we take a teeny break,
just have a little taste?

1210
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,406
Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.

1211
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,245
Greg, will you join us?

1212
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,850
Oh, I'm okay.

1213
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,400
Oh, come on,
don't be a party pooper!

1214
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,845
All right, all right.

1215
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,726
Now we can get back
to our interview.

1216
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,760
GREG: So, basically,
this whole setup

1217
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,966
is so that, you know...

1218
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,849
...I can talk to you,
you can talk to me...

1219
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,161
...and I can see you,
and you can see me.

1220
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,606
Except it's not really me,
it's a phone.

1221
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,603
And I know that
sounds kind of weird,

1222
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,011
but it's not.

1223
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,164
So, anyway, just treat it
like a get-well card,

1224
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,725
you can look into the lens.

1225
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,291
And, uh...

1226
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,204
Yeah, it's a video,
so you know...

1227
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,441
...don't think about it
too hard,

1228
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,210
but just make it good.

1229
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,771
Start whenever you're ready.

1230
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,126
STUDENT: Hi, Rachel.

1231
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,681
I guess I don't really
know you that well...

1232
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,047
...but I believe in you.
You can do it.

1233
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,770
That's real nice, yo.

1234
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,883
It's so sweet
that your boyfriend

1235
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,450
is doing this for you.

1236
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,931
He must really love you.

1237
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,128
EARL: Girl, that ain't
her boyfriend.

1238
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,241
Oh.

1239
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,641
<i>I know you're Jewish,
but I just wanted you to know</i>

1240
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,569
<i>that God has a plan for you.</i>

1241
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,881
<i>You seem like
a really cool person.</i>

1242
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,291
<i>I know we don't really talk.</i>

1243
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,484
<i>But you've got
a lot of friends. And, uh...</i>

1244
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,641
<i>Out of all the people
in this school,</i>

1245
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,290
<i>I don't hate you.</i>

1246
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,121
<i>I believe in you
and you can do it.</i>

1247
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,966
<i>You can do it.</i>

1248
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,970
<i>I believe in you.</i>

1249
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,811
<i>You can do it.</i>

1250
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,325
Damn.

1251
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,168
(EVERYBODY'S TALKIN' PLAYING)

1252
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,403
<i>Everybody's talking at me</i>

1253
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,166
<i>I don't hear a word
they're saying</i>

1254
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,842
<i>Only the echoes of my mind</i>

1255
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,931
GREG: So again,

1256
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,843
<i>if this was a touching,
romantic story...</i>

1257
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,769
<i>...we'd obviously fall in love</i>

1258
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,683
<i>and she'd say all the wise,

that's not what happened.</i>

Feeling like
you might have been right.

1268

Right when?

1269
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,204
Back in October.

1270
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,486
When you thought
I was dying.

1271
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,971
Well, I mean,
I regret thinking that.

1272

Don't regret it.

It's Regretful Polar Bear.

of regret in the animal kingdom.

go back to your life

Have you gotten
comfortable with that?

bother you anymore?

Get outta here, Greg.
You've done your time.

You don't have to hang
around with the sick girl anymore.

How can you even
say that to me?

to hang out with me.

to show me your movies.

the unleakable secret

1416
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,285
because you hold
nothing sacred.

1417

...and I can no longer
trust you in any way.

1421

You'll leak anything to anyone.

1422

you told her about the, uh...

...about the film
that we're making for her.

than me or something?

1434

I don't know if I can
work with you again

1435
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,686

1439

1445
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,566
And then the one girl
who do actually care about you...

1446
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,761
...you wanna come
over here and

1448

1449

1450

...about Rachel.

...not great.

1477
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,562
You know, my dad died
when I was 15, Greg.

1478
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,922
A couple years younger than you.

1479
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,603
You know, the thing is that,
when I was a kid...

1480
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,925
...I really,
I really can only remember

1481
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,843
thinking about him as this...

1482
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,322
...you know, big,
kind of like asshole guy.

1483
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,041
At his wake,
these buddies of his

1484
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,167
kept coming up to me...

1485
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,925
...and telling me
these stories about him.

1486
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,248
And it was like
they were talking about

1487
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,163
some complete other guy.

1488
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,369
To give you an example.

1489
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,249
He knew every single
European pop song

1490
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,651
from the 1970s.

1491
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,801
Every single one.

1492
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,120
He'd memorize these songs,

1493
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,043
and he'd do that
so he could go...

1494
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,090
...and sing them
to German girls in bars.

1495
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,406
He had a go-to,

1496
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,006
his number one
go-to song. It was a...

1497
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,210
It was a Dutch song.
It was called <i>Ding-a-Dong.</i>

1498
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,521
My dad used to sing that
to German girls in bars.

1499
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,404
That's a fact.

1500
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,809
So what does that mean?

1501
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,164
Well, Greg, I think that
it just means that...

1502
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,680
...even after somebody dies,
you can...

1503
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,881
...you can still
keep learning about them.

1504
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,651
You know, their life.

1505
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,643
It can keep unfolding
itself to you just as long...

1506
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,126
...just as long as
you pay attention to it.

1507
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,691
Are you seriously
trying to turn this

1508
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,081

01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,206
Greg, you guys
have been working on it

1570
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,691
for like four months.

1571
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,166
Yeah, well...

1572
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:50,966
I don't know,
we tried a bunch of stuff

1573
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,883
and it just...

1574
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,327
...didn't really work.

1575
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,440
It's not that good.
(SIGHS)

1576
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,607
Greg!

1577
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,371
Now is not the time for your
"I'm Greg, I suck,

1578
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,930
"nothing I do
is any good" thing.

1579
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,206
I'm sure what you have
is awesome

1580
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,169
and I think she would
really benefit...

1581
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,720
...if you just got it done
and gave it to her.

1582
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,568
Madison,
she stopped treatment.

1583
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,806
She gave up.

1584
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,405
She quit.

1585
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,765
Well, I guess
that's a really good reason

1586
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,365
to just finish
the fucking movie.

1587
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,885
And give it to her.

1588
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,371
But whatever.

1589
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,685
Honey?

1590
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,441
What?

1591
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,401
Rachel's back
in the hospital, honey.

1592
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,841
Wait, is she starting
treatment again?

1593
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,328
It's not for treatment, honey.

1594
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,441
Oh.

1595
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,565
Mom, what?

1596
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,611
Well, I thought
we could go and...

1597
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,761
You just thought
this was your last chance

1598
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,888
to force me
to hang out with her?

1599
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:20,961
Greg, come on.

1600
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,121
Don't worry, Mom,
I'm sure you can find

1601
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,487
another girl with cancer
after Rachel dies.

1602
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,803
Which, by the way...

1603
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,969
...she's decided to do.

1604
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,526
She's just decided to die...

1605
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,410
...so maybe I can decide
not to visit her.

1606
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,130
(SIGHING)

1607
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,730
I promise you,
you will regret that...

1608
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:46,961
...if you don't visit her.

1609

(SCOFFS)

1610
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,009
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

1611
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,571
Mom, that's probably true.

1612
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,131
But honestly,
I have a shitload of things

1613
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,645
to regret right now.

1614
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,280
I regret not having a date
for tomorrow's stupid prom.

1615
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,011
I regret being too weird
to make friends.

1616
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,207
I definitely regret making

1617
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,566
all those shitty films
with Earl.

1618
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,206
And I assume you saw the email
I got today, from Pitt?

1619
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,766
Oh, no? You didn't see it

1620
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,604
while you're going though
all my shit? Here.

1621
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,410
Have a look.

1622
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,726
I'm definitely gonna regret

1623
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,723
doing literally
no school work this year!

1624
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,201
Oh, my God, Greg.

1625
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,964
I know. Admission rescinded,

1626
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,327
due to significant change
in my academic record.

1627
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,890
Oh, well,
no college next year.

1628
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,008
I guess I'll just be home,
which sucks for you...

1629
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,081
...because it's gonna be
so hard for you

1630
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,690
to go through all my stuff.

1631
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,489
Can you just do me a favor
right now, Mom?

1632
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,846
Just leave me alone. Okay?

1633
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,763
Just let me sit here
and regret stuff.

1634
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,880
I'm just gonna think about

1635
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,007
all the things
that I've ever done...

1636
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,366
...and all the things
I haven't done

1637
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,125
and just regret the living shit out of it.
Okay?

1638

GREG'S MOM: All the deadlines
have passed, Victor.

1639
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,566
What's he gonna do next year?

1640
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,920
He's just gonna waste the year?

1641
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,325
GREG'S DAD:
He is grieving, honey.

1642
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,561
You have to let him grieve.

1643
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,721
GREG'S MOM:
But I can't just sit by

Well, he's doing it.

Let me ask you something.
What is this?

What is up
with the arm touching?

1656
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,407
Are you just being friendly,

1657
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,686
or is this some
calculated maneuver...

1658
