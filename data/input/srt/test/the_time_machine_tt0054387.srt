1
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:30,135
Excuse me, Mr. Filby!

2
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
I say...

3
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:48,852
- l say, it's outright rude of the man!
- He's merely being detained, that's all.

4
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,105
This is such a confounded waste of time!

5
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,070
lf he's not coming,
l have any number of more important things to do.

6
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,993
Well, speak up. What is it, woman?

7
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:15,176
Well, are we or are we not
invited for dinner?

8
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,386
Apparently, we are.

9
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:23,060
- How long has he been gone?
- Well, l can't rightly say, sir. Several days.

10
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:25,563
l've hardly seen him for some time.

11
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:30,193
And he never leaves the laboratory. He only
comes in and picks at his food.

12
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:35,409
But he did tell me about dinner tonight, sir,
and left those instructions.

13
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,788
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.

14
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:44,920
- Well, what does it say, Filby? What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing, really.

15
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:50,091
George merely says that if he's not here
by 8 o'clock, then we're to begin without him.

16
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,929
Walter, what time is it?

17
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,853
Dinner is served, gentlemen.

18
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:03,399
First sensible thing
l've heard all evening.

19
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:08,531
This is peculiar. He's usually most
prompt, precise and punctual.

20
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,162
He's making fools of us by inviting us here and then
not showing up. lt's not the behaviour of a gentleman.

21
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:17,499
- To say nothing of a waste of time.
- Yes. To say nothing of a waste of time.

22
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,630
It's one thing l like about our George:
he's got the best cellar in the southern England.

23
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,217
And Mrs. Watchett is
the finest cook in the world.

24
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,219
Yes, l think l'll drink to that.

25
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:46,200
- Good Lord! What's happened?
- l'm all right.

26
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:50,330
Some food.

27
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:54,167
A drink.

28
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,977
- l didn't recognize you.
- Mrs. Watchett.

29
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:18,655
Well, can't you speak, man?
What happened to you?

30
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:20,699
- Leave him alone, can't yo?.
- lt's all right.

31
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:25,580
- l've got to tell it now, David, while l still remember it.
- Relax. Try to relax.

32
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,126
You've all the time in the world.

33
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:33,213
You're right, David.

34
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,883
That's exactly what l have.

35
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:40,638
All the time in the world.

36
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:45,144
Ever since we were together
five days ago,..

37
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:47,522
....the last day of 1 899.

38
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:55,781
There in that box rests
the result of two years' labor.

39
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:02,706
l wanted to finish the job
before the new century began.

40
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,208
l barely made it.

41
00:07:07,212 --> 00:07:09,923
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Marvelous, old boy.

42
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:12,509
Yes, but what is it?

43
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,724
Well, it has to do with time.

44
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:20,979
Oh, l've always maintained
that what this nation needs...

45
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:23,357
...is a reliable timepiece.

46
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:25,108
The navy needs one.

47
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:28,154
The army needs one
for the artillery, you know.

48
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:32,952
You couldn't do better, George.
So that's why you've been in hiding, huh?

49
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,663
That's very clever of you, indeed.

50
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:39,667
l don't think George is referring
to a new type of timepiece.

51
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,587
No, David.

52
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,386
When l speak of time, gentlemen,
l'm referring to the fourth dimension.

53
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:52,390
Go on, George.

54
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,647
Well, the difficulty in explaining the fourth
dimension is that it cannot be seen or felt.

55
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:04,071
lf you don't mind, George, would you refresh me
on the first three dimensions?

56
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:08,451
Really, Filby. Surely they
taught you something at school.

57
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,954
Suppose you explain it, doctor.

58
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:13,665
Certainly.

59
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,215
For example, when l move in a straight line,
forward or backward....

60
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,134
...that's one dimension.

61
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:26,681
And when l move to the left or right -
two dimensions.

62
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,850
And when l move up or down -..

63
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:31,060
...three dimensions.

64
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,023
For instance, that box.

65
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:40,447
Well, that box has three dimensions:
length, breadth and height.

66
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:43,034
Yes, but what is the fourth dimension?

67
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:48,624
That's mere theory. No one really knows
what the fourth dimension is or even that it exists.

68
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,250
On the contrary, Doctor.

69
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,881
The fourth dimension is as real
and true a dimension as any of the other three.

70
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,800
ln fact, they couldn't
exist without it.

71
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,052
What do you mean?

72
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:02,222
Let's take that box.

73
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,518
lt has the first three dimensions, as you said.

74
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:08,228
- All right. But what's in that box?
- l'm coming to that.

75
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:10,232
Let's consider this first.

76
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,529
Why is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension?
Because we have no freedom of movement within it.

77
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:20,619
You see, we can move in the other three:
up, down, forward, sideways, backward, as the Doctor said.

78
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,831
But when it comes to time,
we are prisoners.

79
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:30,172
Do you follow me, Bridey?

80
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:31,840
No.

81
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:39,600
George, you've given the most lucid explanation
of all, but l'm afraid l don't quite understand.

82
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:43,438
Walter, look, there are many things in this
world you don't understand, aren't there?

83
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:44,981
Yes, quite... quite a number.

84
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:47,986
Well, you don't refuse to believe in
them because of that, do you?

85
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:52,449
- No, not if l can see the proof with my own eyes.
- Good, Walter.

86
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,702
Gentlemen, all l'm asking you to do now...

87
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,666
...is to witness a demonstration
of the possibility of movement...

88
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,210
...within the fourth dimension.

89
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:11,555
- Doctor, can l have your help?
- Oh, certainly, certainly.

90
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,376
lt's beautiful!

91
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:40,172
- It's remarkable.
- Very nice, George.

92
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:42,882
Fascinating.

93
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:44,677
What is it?

94
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:47,430
This is only a small experimental model, of course.

95
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:54,604
- To carry a man, a larger edition is needed.
- To carry a man? Where?

96
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,692
lnto the past or into the future.

97
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:00,820
This is a time machine.

98
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:05,869
All right, George, now you've had your little joke.
Suppose you tell us what this contraption's really for.

99
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,954
l've already told you, Doctor.

100
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:12,000
The larger model can be used to
carry a passenger on a journey through time.

101
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,712
Not through space, mind you, but through time.

102
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:19,051
I say, George, if you're gonna start floating about in the future,
how'd you gonna rather mess things up for the rest of us?

103
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:22,806
Well, the future's already there.
lt's irrevocable and cannot be changed.

104
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:26,559
l wonder.

105
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:32,400
Now, that's the most important question
to which l hope to find an answer.

106
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:38,740
Can man control his destiny? Can he
change the shape of things to come?

107
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:41,994
Now, look here, George, if you've
gone out of your head, l forgive you.

108
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:47,376
- But if you've made us waste all this time,..
- No, Doctor! You're here as witnesses.

109
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:50,880
- To see, not to listen.
- To see? What?

110
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,300
The experiment l am about to perform.

111
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,683
First, let me tell you how it works.
Here, in this compartment, you see the saddle, where the time traveller sits.

112
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,686
And in front of him are the controls.

113
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:07,483
Let's do this properly.
You can spare a cigar, l trust, Doctor?

114
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:13,781
Now, let us imagine that this cigar...

115
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,535
....is the time traveller.

116
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:20,914
Now, in front of him is the lever,
which controls movement.

117
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,793
Forward pressure sends
the machine into the future,..

118
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,715
...backward pressure - into the past.

119
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:31,844
And the harder the pressure,
the faster the machine travels.

120
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:35,599
Of course, our little experiment
can be performed only once.

121
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:41,898
lf it succeeds, l lose my model forever.
That's why l need witnesses.

122
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,319
Go ahead, George.

123
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:47,864
All ready, gentlemen?

124
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:56,749
Doctor, would you here lend me your hand?

125
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,184
l'll be damned!

126
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,061
lt worked.

127
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:54,401
- But where did it go?
- Go?

128
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:57,153
Nowhere, in the usual sense.
lt's still here.

129
00:13:58,823 --> 00:14:01,326
But it's no longer in the present.

130
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:06,081
Do you realise? lt's travelling through time.
To the future, to be exact.

131
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,750
Do you really expect us to believe such a story?

132
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:10,962
Well, you've just... Certainly.

133
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,549
- But you yourself just said that it hadn't really moved.
- That's correct.

134
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:16,760
Well, then why can't we see it?

135
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:20,222
Because we're in this room
on the 31st of December, 1899...

136
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:24,018
...but the model we just saw is perhaps
a hundred years away by now.

137
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:27,607
This room, even this whole house
may not be here in a hundred years.

138
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:31,152
But the time machine occupies
the same space that it did...

139
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:33,363
...a moment before it went off on its journey.

140
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:37,241
Well, if it's occupying the same space,
why can't l feel it?

141
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,331
You must remember that the space you're
putting your hand through is today's space.

142
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:44,667
You can't put your hand
into the space of tomorrow.

143
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,213
Space doesn't change!

144
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:50,926
The same space that's here
now should be here in a hundred or even a thousand years from now.

145
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,803
No, Philip, time changes space!

146
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,063
Look, this flat ground we're stading on could've been
at the bottom of the sea a million years ago.

147
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:07,194
And a million years from now, it could be
the interior of a huge mountain.

148
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:12,742
All right, suppose, what you say is true, what do you
expect to do with such a contraption?

149
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:14,912
Contraption?

150
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:19,543
For my part, l intend taking
a journey into the future.

151
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:23,130
Well, perhaps the doctor
would volunteer to go?

152
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,882
Well, look here, George...

153
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,553
...suppose you do and go off and get lost
in the 50th century or something.

154
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:33,726
- How you're gonna get back?
- That's a risk l'm prepared  to take.

155
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,564
Now, look here, George.

156
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,818
l don't know what you think us for,
but we're not fools, you know!

157
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,903
We're practical men, businessmen.

158
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:45,657
No, now, the question l want to put you is this:

159
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:50,078
Even if you had invented
a time machine, or what have you called it, what of it?

160
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:54,042
What use would it be to anyone? Who would want to buy it?
And how much would they be willing to pay for it?

161
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,546
Yes, George, have you thought of the
commercial possibilities?

162
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,548
No, l really haven't.

163
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:05,179
George...! There's a war on, you know,
in South Africa.

164
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:10,436
The Boers are putting up a pretty stiff fight.
Now, George, the country needs inventors like you.

165
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,731
l can put you in touch
with the War Office if you wish.

166
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,405
What do you think, David?

167
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:26,245
Oh, I think Dr. Hillyer has a good point, George.

168
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:29,458
Now, we're becoming more sensible.

169
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,835
l'll see to it first thing in the new year.

170
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:34,255
Good Lord! lt's time to go, gentlemen.

171
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:37,635
Yes, l'm sure we all
have our plans for tonight.

172
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:43,683
- Are you all right, George?
- Yes, l'm all right, Bridey.

173
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:45,434
Coming, Bridewell?

174
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:53,111
Thank you for coming.

175
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,406
- Good night, George.
- Happy New Year, George.

176
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,035
- Happy new century, George.
- Good night, Bridey.

177
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:20,809
Happy New Year!

178
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,653
l thought l'd better stay.

179
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:52,209
Well, You shouldn't have troubled yourself, David.
l'm all right.

180
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:54,129
No, you're not.

181
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:57,882
You've been behaving oddly
for over a month now.

182
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:02,013
l'm not leaving here until you tell me
what's on your mind.

183
00:19:02,222 --> 00:19:06,268
Look, David, l appreciate the gesture, but
l just wanna be left alone, that's all.

184
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,563
You've changed, George.
Enormously.

185
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:13,317
l'm sorry.

186
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,742
Will you answer me one question,
honestly?

187
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,954
Yes, l'll try.

188
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,543
Why this preoccupation with time?

189
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,130
Why not?

190
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,925
Don't go simple on me, George.

191
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:41,100
All right, if you want to know the truth, l don't much care
for the time l was born into.

192
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:44,145
It seems people aren't dying fast enough these days.

193
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,440
They call upon science...

194
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:50,862
...to invent new, more efficient
weapons to depopulate the Earth.

195
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,114
And l agree with you.

196
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:57,703
l agree, George. But here we are
and we have to make the best of it.

197
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:59,831
You may have to. l don't.

198
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,586
All right. Take your journey
on your contraption.

199
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,378
Who would you become?

200
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,300
A Greek? A Roman?

201
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,177
- One of the pharaohs?
- l prefer the future.

202
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,767
You're not seriously saying
you can do it?

203
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:19,813
David, you saw the experiment
this afternoon, didn't you?

204
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:23,526
l saw a toy machine vanish.

205
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:28,323
l'm certain that there are any
number of ways of doing that trick.

206
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:31,661
Any magician with a hippodrome could probably do it.

207
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:34,080
lt wasn't a trick!

208
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,962
- Would you like to see the full-scale model?
- No, l would not.

209
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,758
l have no desire
to tempt the laws of Providence.

210
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:46,468
And l don't think you should.

211
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:52,268
- lt's not for man to trifle with.
- You carry on like Hillyer and Kemp now.

212
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:56,480
There is something to say about
their common-sense attitude to life.

213
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,776
George, l speak to you as a friend.

214
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:04,657
More. As a brother.

215
00:21:05,575 --> 00:21:09,539
lf that machine can do
what you say it can, destroy it.

216
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:13,041
Destroy it, George, before it destroys you!

217
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:19,008
You must have plans for New Year's
Eve, David. Don't let me keep you.

218
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:26,225
Mary wasn't well. We thought
we'd stay home with the baby.

219
00:21:28,226 --> 00:21:33,233
Why don't you come home with me?
You haven't seen wee Jamey for a long time.

220
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:39,948
l'm sorry, l can't, David.

221
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,787
What's stopping you?

222
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:49,001
Well... Look, l just want to see the old century
out by myself, that's all.

223
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:54,049
Have it your way, George.

224
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:05,938
George, will you promise you'll not
go out of the house tonight?

225
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:12,362
l promise you l won't walk out the door.

226
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:23,209
Davy, l'm sorry. Please don't
think me unkind or unfriendly, I...

227
00:22:23,418 --> 00:22:26,420
- Look, just come over to dinner next Friday, will you.
- Very well.

228
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:30,758
- Fine. Bring the others with you.
- As you say, George.

229
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,431
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, David.

230
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:26,240
- Having supper in tonight, sir?
- l don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.

231
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:29,537
Why don't you take the evening off and celebrate?

232
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:34,583
Well, thank you, sir, but if you're not need in me,
I think l'll turn in earlier and get some sleep,.. if l can.

233
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,879
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

234
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:42,885
Oh, Mrs. Watchett, l've invited Mr. Filby
and the others to dinner next Friday night.

235
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:43,343
Oh, yes, sir.

236
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:45,472
- Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.
- Happy New Year, sir.

237
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:15,731
At first, I pushed
the lever forward ever so slightly...

238
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,404
...and the laboratory
grew faint around me.

239
00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:38,383
I stopped.

240
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:44,683
No change.

241
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:47,853
Everything exactly as it had been before.

242
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:53,401
But no! The clock said 6:31 when
I started, and now it was... 8:09?

243
00:26:55,153 --> 00:26:57,657
And the candle, shorter by inches!

244
00:27:01,035 --> 00:27:06,083
And yet by my watch, which was in the machine
with me, only a few seconds had passed.

245
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,320
It was disconcerting to see
the sun arc in less than a minute.

246
00:27:31,988 --> 00:27:34,032
To see a snail race by.

247
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,496
My flowers flinging wide their petals
to embrace the new day.

248
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:42,209
And the hours speeding across the face of my sundial.

249
00:27:43,086 --> 00:27:46,004
And the flowers closing their eyes
for the night.

250
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:47,842
It was wonderful!

251
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:51,762
Changes that normally took hours
occuring in seconds.

252
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:57,810
Dear Mrs. Watchett...

253
00:27:58,937 --> 00:28:00,814
...always able to tell me what tie to wear...

254
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:03,944
...but never able to decide to wear anything more stylish...

255
00:28:04,194 --> 00:28:06,655
... than the type of clothes she's worn all these years.

256
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,950
And as yet I was traveling very slowly.

257
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:13,287
What if I went faster?

258
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:43,406
It became intoxicating.

259
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,870
So I pushed the lever on
toward even greater speed.

260
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:57,757
As I went along I gained experience in handling the machine.

261
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:04,389
I found that I could stop for a day, an hour,
or even for a second to observe.

262
00:29:07,518 --> 00:29:09,938
Then go ahead a year or two.

263
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:15,194
Thus, I was able to see the changing world
in a series of glimpses.

264
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,286
Good heavens. That's a dress?

265
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:27,290
This was intriguing.

266
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:31,839
I wonderedjust how far women
would permit this to go.

267
00:29:50,277 --> 00:29:53,239
I began to grow very fond
of that mannequin.

268
00:29:53,822 --> 00:29:56,951
Maybe because, like me,
she didn't age.

269
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:16,182
Thirteen years have passed.
Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

270
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:22,272
and then suddenly the light was gone.
What had happened?

271
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:27,613
In the year of 1917, I stopped.

272
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,846
Filby!

273
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,684
Well, what are you doing? Are you in a masquerade party?

274
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:21,234
You look rather silly
without your mustache, old man.

275
00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:24,445
- Were you addressing me, sir?
- Filby, it's George!

276
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:27,366
Well, I must say l expected a little more enthusiastic a greeting...

277
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:30,035
I think you're confusing me with my father, sir.

278
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:34,875
Yes, there was quite a resemblance.
l'm James Filby.

279
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,460
"Was"?

280
00:33:39,338 --> 00:33:42,049
- Were you a friend of Father's?
- Yes.

281
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:44,136
Yes, l've been away.

282
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:48,725
He was killed in the war.
A year ago.

283
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:57,192
Oh, l'm so sorry.

284
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:04,492
- What about the gentleman across the street?
- Oh, him, the inventor chap?

285
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:08,540
He disappeared around the turn
of the century.

286
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:12,753
Look, here, if you're interested in that house, sir,
I'm afraid you can't buy it.

287
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:15,882
- Can't even get inside.
- Why is that?

288
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:21,847
Well, my father was executor of the inventor's estate
and father just refused to liquidate it.

289
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,808
l often chided him on that account...

290
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:28,354
...but he felt positive the owner
would return some day.

291
00:34:28,563 --> 00:34:31,399
People hereabouts
think it's haunted, but...

292
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:35,612
Who are you, sir?

293
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,328
Just a stranger who
once knew your father.

294
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:45,166
Have you been at the front?

295
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:48,169
Front? What front?

296
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,423
What the... the war, of course.

297
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,677
What war?

298
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,804
Good heavens!

299
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:00,977
You mean you don't know we've been at war
with Germany since 1914?

300
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,230
l thought you'd just returned
from France perhaps.

301
00:35:04,438 --> 00:35:05,357
Or perhaps...

302
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:10,280
...perhaps a cup of tea
might make you feel better, sir?

303
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:12,657
Won't you come in?

304
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,867
No, no, thank you.

305
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,708
Are you sure you're all right, sir?

306
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:24,588
Yes, l'm quite all right.

307
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:28,425
Then goodbye, sir.

308
00:35:32,555 --> 00:35:33,974
Goodbye, Jamey.

309
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:14,259
Suddenly, in 1940, I began to be buffeted
from side to side.

310
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:18,139
My first thought was that the machine had
a mechanical defect or if a quark had worn out.

311
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:40,873
The last time I had stopped
was in 1917, 23 years ago.

312
00:37:41,332 --> 00:37:46,380
And the war with Germany was still waging. Now in
the air with flying machines.

313
00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:52,553
Then I realized the truth of the matter.
This was a new war.

314
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:57,726
I decided to push on into time
and see the outcome of this.

315
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:03,067
Then my house was hit!

316
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:06,654
The flames shot up into the sky.
And my home was gone in an instant.

317
00:38:06,862 --> 00:38:08,739
And I found myself in the open air.

318
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:21,587
The years rolled by,
everything unfamiliar.

319
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:29,097
Except the smile of my
never-aging friend.

320
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:33,644
But what was this? Weird sounds
all around me. What could it be?

321
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,771
My curiosity compelled me to stop.

322
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:57,921
At first, I wondered if my machine I was
the cause of the panic.

323
00:39:01,593 --> 00:39:03,721
Well, I was soon to find out that we weren't.

324
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:06,181
Keep it moving here! Shove it on!

325
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:17,737
Come on, into the shelter.

326
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:13,470
Come on, young man! Come on! Come on!

327
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:17,057
- Filby?
- The name is Mr. Filby.

328
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:20,894
- And didn't you hear the air raid siren?
- You mean the horrible screeching?

329
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:23,856
lt wasn't constructed
for its aesthetic value, young man...

330
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:27,152
...but to warn silly young fools
like you to get into the shelter.

331
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:30,698
- Now, come along, come along.
- But l'm perfectly comfortable here, Mr. Filby.

332
00:40:30,907 --> 00:40:33,827
l've got to talk to somebody.
This is fantastic!

333
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:37,039
Your store is magnificent!
The achievements!

334
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:41,628
- The gigantic strides that man kinded!
- Come along, young man! Come along! Come along!

335
00:40:42,128 --> 00:40:44,672
You better hurry or the mushrooms will be sprouting!

336
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,091
Mushrooms?

337
00:40:50,221 --> 00:40:54,225
You look familiar.
Haven't we met somewhere before?

338
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:59,106
lndeed we have, Mr. Filby.
Right there. Many years ago.

339
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,233
l was sure of that.

340
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:04,030
But the exact time escapes me.

341
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:09,785
lt was two wars ago. 1917.

342
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:14,626
Now l recall. The chap
who inquired about my father...

343
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:18,755
...and the house that
used to stand across the way.

344
00:41:20,632 --> 00:41:24,886
But no...
No, that's impossible!

345
00:41:25,304 --> 00:41:28,558
You haven't changed.
You're not a day older.

346
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:30,894
And your clothes!

347
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:35,024
Don't worry, Filby.
lt'll take a little time to explain, but...

348
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:39,571
That's the last alert!
Hurry! Hurry!

349
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,532
- Listen, this is important.
- Look!

350
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:48,748
An atomic satellite, zeroing in.
That's important.

351
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:53,170
- But l've got to talk to you!
- Come on!

352
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:56,925
Hurry!

353
00:41:57,259 --> 00:41:59,135
Till the all clear!

354
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:02,555
But, Filby, l've got to talk to you!

355
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:40,059
The labor of centuries,
gone in an instant.

356
00:42:50,822 --> 00:42:53,783
And then mother Earth,
aroused by man 's violence...

357
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:57,830
...responded with volcanic violence
of her own.

358
00:43:55,607 --> 00:44:01,153
Only my speed through time saved me from
being roasted alive and encased in stone forever.

359
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:04,492
The molten rock cooled.

360
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:14,713
I prayed...

361
00:44:15,046 --> 00:44:17,965
...wondering how many centuries,
how many eons must pass...

362
00:44:18,174 --> 00:44:22,345
...before the wind and rain
could wear away the mountain that enclosed me.

363
00:44:35,863 --> 00:44:37,406
Darkness.

364
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,452
Darkness for centuries.

365
00:44:44,456 --> 00:44:48,376
I wondered if there was still
a war being waged on the ground above me...

366
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:52,632
...if man would still exist on Earth
when I saw the sun again.

367
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,384
The centuries rolled by.

368
00:44:57,012 --> 00:44:59,056
I put my trust in time...

369
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:02,061
...and waited for the rock
to wear down around me.

370
00:45:05,606 --> 00:45:07,231
I was free again!

371
00:45:16,202 --> 00:45:20,206
Thousands of centuries had passed
but the Earth had stayed green.

372
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:22,833
There was no winter, no wars.

373
00:45:24,043 --> 00:45:28,299
Had man finally learned to control
both the elements and himself?

374
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,009
I had to stop and find out.

375
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:51,952
But I'd stopped too fast.

376
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,670
Magnificent!

377
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,967
Flowers. Beautiful flowers everywhere!

378
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:20,055
Natural splendor beyond compare.

379
00:47:23,434 --> 00:47:27,815
The whole landscape - one vast garden
without any sign of weeds or briars.

380
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:33,071
Trees and vines laden with fruit
of strange shapes and colors.

381
00:47:33,698 --> 00:47:36,033
Nature tamed completely...

382
00:47:36,366 --> 00:47:38,910
...and more bountiful than ever before!

383
00:47:39,328 --> 00:47:41,832
At last I'd found a paradise.

384
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:48,505
But it would be no paradise
if it'd belong to me alone.

385
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:14,996
Unrepaired for centuries.
Maybe unlived-in for as long.

386
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:32,378
Anybody here?

387
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:53,002
So this is man 's future: to bask
in the sunlight, bathe in the clear streams...

388
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:57,632
...and eat the fruits of the Earth,
with all knowledge of work and hardship forgotten.

389
00:51:58,718 --> 00:52:00,344
Well, and why not?

390
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:30,170
Don't just sit there! Help her!

391
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,277
Are you all right?

392
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,388
Thank you.

393
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:29,394
- Why did you?
- Why did l what?

394
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,732
Come after me.

395
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:37,113
Sit down.

396
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:43,328
l did it to save your life.

397
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:47,457
That doesn't seem to mean
much to you, or anybody else around here.

398
00:54:47,707 --> 00:54:49,626
lt doesn't.

399
00:54:50,628 --> 00:54:53,799
Do you realize that there were about
twenty of your friends watching you drown.

400
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:56,844
Not one of them so much as lifted a finger to save you.

401
00:54:57,052 --> 00:54:59,430
That's a very curious attitude.

402
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:03,561
Very curious world.

403
00:55:07,064 --> 00:55:11,528
Aren't you the least bit interested in who l am?
Where l come from?

404
00:55:12,112 --> 00:55:13,447
Should l be?

405
00:55:17,453 --> 00:55:21,582
I think, perhaps, you better take me to somebody a little older.
Somebody l can talk to.

406
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,542
There is no one older.

407
00:55:25,879 --> 00:55:29,048
Do you mean nobody ages
in this land of yours?

408
00:55:33,262 --> 00:55:36,767
- Well, what's your name?
- Weena.

409
00:55:40,312 --> 00:55:42,105
How do you spell it?

410
00:55:44,357 --> 00:55:47,779
- Spell?
- Spell, write. Can't you write?

411
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:50,533
Look.

412
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:01,629
- What are your people called?
- Eloi.

413
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:15,895
Come. We must go now.

414
00:56:16,104 --> 00:56:18,398
- Why, what's wrong?
- lt's getting dark.

415
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:43,650
Hello.

416
00:56:46,473 --> 00:56:49,393
l don't mind telling you,
l'm quite hungry.

417
00:56:50,895 --> 00:56:53,105
And l've come a long, long way.

418
00:56:57,236 --> 00:56:59,698
You know, in my time, a berry that size...

419
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:03,118
...would've been big news
all over the civilized world.

420
00:57:08,082 --> 00:57:09,624
Excuse me, sir?

421
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:13,547
Sir?

422
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:19,679
Perhaps curiosity is died.
Perhaps...

423
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:24,310
...even courtesy is died, but l have come
a long way and l would like to know a few things.

424
00:57:24,852 --> 00:57:25,977
Why?

425
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,322
Well, because l shall return to my time,
and my people will ask me questions.

426
00:57:36,282 --> 00:57:37,824
Such as:

427
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:40,913
Well, what kind of government
rules your world?

428
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:43,999
We have no government.

429
00:57:45,335 --> 00:57:50,215
Well, you must have a body of men
who pass and enforce laws.

430
00:57:51,174 --> 00:57:53,677
Laws? There are no laws.

431
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,185
Where do you get food and clothing?

432
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,022
Doesn't anybody work?

433
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,901
No.

434
00:58:07,861 --> 00:58:09,738
Well, where does all that come from?

435
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:14,118
- lt grows. lt always grows.
- Yes, l know, but it must be...

436
00:58:14,827 --> 00:58:17,331
...cultivated and planted
and nurtured...

437
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:22,503
Well, unless you...

438
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:27,424
...well, you may have an economy so well-developed
that you can spend all your time...

439
00:58:28,385 --> 00:58:31,263
...studying and experimenting?
ls that right?

440
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:33,892
You ask many questions.

441
00:58:38,188 --> 00:58:41,608
Well, that is the only way that
man has learned and developed.

442
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:43,528
l wish to learn.

443
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:49,743
l want to learn about you,
about your civilization.

444
00:58:58,461 --> 00:59:00,339
Perhaps you... Do you have books?

445
00:59:00,881 --> 00:59:02,593
Books?

446
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:05,344
- Yes, we have books.
- Ah, wonderful!

447
00:59:05,553 --> 00:59:10,350
l can learn all I want about you from books.
Books will tell me what l want to know.

448
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:14,231
Could l see the books?

449
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,773
Yes, they do tell me all about you.

450
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,041
What have you done?

451
01:00:06,376 --> 01:00:10,923
Thousands of years of building and
rebuilding, creating and re-creating...

452
01:00:11,131 --> 01:00:13,759
...so you can let it all crumble to dust!

453
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,516
A million years of sensitive men
dying for their dreams.

454
01:00:19,724 --> 01:00:20,976
For what?!

455
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:25,565
So you can swim and dance...

456
01:00:26,649 --> 01:00:28,234
...and play!

457
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,331
You! All of you!

458
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:45,171
l'm going back to my own time! l won't again bother
to tell of the useless struggle...

459
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:49,426
...the hopeless future.
But at least l could die among men!

460
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,291
- Weena, what are you doing?
- I hear you pounding. l came to warn you.

461
01:04:13,499 --> 01:04:18,088
- Weena, how do you open that panel?
- No one opens it. Only the Morlocks.

462
01:04:18,756 --> 01:04:20,340
The Morlocks? But who are the Morlocks?

463
01:04:24,053 --> 01:04:28,058
They give us the food we eat and the clothes we wear.
We must obey their command.

464
01:04:28,267 --> 01:04:29,977
Why'd they taken my machine?

465
01:04:31,564 --> 01:04:33,398
Weena, you've got to tell me!

466
01:04:36,235 --> 01:04:38,614
But... it is night. We mustn't be out in the dark.

467
01:04:39,488 --> 01:04:42,159
Only little children are frightened
by the dark.

468
01:04:43,453 --> 01:04:45,162
And you are a little child, aren't you?

469
01:04:45,412 --> 01:04:48,083
- Well, don't be frightened, l'll light a fire.
- Please, let us go.

470
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:52,253
Weena, I can't. My machine is inside there.
l've got to wait here until morning and find some way of getting it out.

471
01:04:52,545 --> 01:04:55,841
- No, you mustn't.
- Come on. Help me gather some wood.

472
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:12,611
That's a girl.

473
01:05:21,622 --> 01:05:23,332
Where are you from?

474
01:05:25,709 --> 01:05:28,548
As a matter of fact,
l'm from right here.

475
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:33,386
That's where my house used to be...

476
01:05:34,345 --> 01:05:36,389
...many thousands of years ago.

477
01:05:38,432 --> 01:05:39,810
You see there?

478
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:44,649
From there up to those panels was my laboratory.

479
01:05:45,774 --> 01:05:48,904
Then beyond the panels was where
my garden used to be.

480
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:52,491
Right there.

481
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,787
That was my library.

482
01:05:56,538 --> 01:05:59,458
Where l once sat
talking with friends about...

483
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:01,587
...the time machine.

484
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:13,475
You know, Weena,..

485
01:06:14,726 --> 01:06:17,062
...l'd hoped to learn
such a great deal.

486
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:24,905
l'd hoped to take back the knowledge
and the advancement that mankind had made.

487
01:06:25,906 --> 01:06:28,199
And instead, l find vegetables.

488
01:06:29,368 --> 01:06:32,497
The human race reduced
to living vegetables.

489
01:06:45,137 --> 01:06:48,057
They're gone. Are you all right?

490
01:06:52,229 --> 01:06:54,147
- That was a Morlock, was it?
- Yes.

491
01:06:54,397 --> 01:06:57,818
Oh, don't you worry.
The fire seems to keep them away.

492
01:07:12,378 --> 01:07:15,923
What are you doing?
Why did you put your hand in the fire?

493
01:07:16,173 --> 01:07:17,967
l never saw it before.

494
01:07:23,224 --> 01:07:24,933
No knowledge of fire?

495
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,312
No books? No...

496
01:07:32,234 --> 01:07:33,861
l'm terribly sorry.

497
01:07:35,572 --> 01:07:38,867
I'm sorry I was angry
with your people. I had no right to be.

498
01:07:41,078 --> 01:07:46,166
No more than if l'd visited
the island of Bali in my own time.

499
01:07:50,423 --> 01:07:52,008
But, you know, Weena...

500
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:57,472
You were safe inside your great house,
and yet you came out into the night to warn me.

501
01:07:58,306 --> 01:08:02,520
The one characteristic which
distinguished man from the animal kingdom...

502
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:06,024
...was the spirit of self-sacrifice.

503
01:08:07,192 --> 01:08:09,069
And you have that quality.

504
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:14,451
I think all your people have it really.
lt just needs someone to reawaken it.

505
01:08:17,704 --> 01:08:20,166
l should like to try, if you let me.

506
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:21,625
Will you?

507
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:24,630
l do not understand you...

508
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,716
...but l believe you.

509
01:08:28,008 --> 01:08:30,052
That's as good a start as any.

510
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:36,936
Try to tell me.
The Morlocks - who or what are the Morlocks?

511
01:08:37,227 --> 01:08:39,605
Are they animals or people?

512
01:08:43,233 --> 01:08:45,112
Well, what about yourself?

513
01:08:46,321 --> 01:08:49,409
The past. Don't your people
ever speak of the past?

514
01:08:50,492 --> 01:08:52,246
There is no past.

515
01:08:54,623 --> 01:08:57,752
Well, do they ever wonder
about the future?

516
01:08:59,461 --> 01:09:00,922
There is no future.

517
01:09:06,636 --> 01:09:08,097
Well, the past,..

518
01:09:08,556 --> 01:09:09,933
...man's past,..

519
01:09:12,894 --> 01:09:15,648
...is mainly a grim struggle
for survival.

520
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:21,112
But there have been moments
when a few voices have spoken up...

521
01:09:22,447 --> 01:09:26,202
...and these rare moments
have made the history of man - man's past -..

522
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,830
...a glorious thing.

523
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:33,669
l refuse to believe it's dead and gone.

524
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:38,466
We've had our dark ages before.
And this is just another one of them.

525
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:43,222
All it needs is for someone
to show you the way out.

526
01:09:46,393 --> 01:09:48,269
l'm only a tinkering mechanic, but...

527
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:52,023
...l'm sure there must be
this hidden spark in one of your people.

528
01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:55,194
lf only l can kindle that spark...

529
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:58,407
...my coming here will have some meaning.

530
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:09,002
My efforts next morning to open
the panel were fruitless.

531
01:10:09,252 --> 01:10:12,632
I had to find another way
to retrieve my machine.

532
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:22,060
Listen.

533
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:24,604
Weenie, you hear that?

534
01:10:26,649 --> 01:10:28,108
Yes.

535
01:10:29,109 --> 01:10:30,778
Machines?

536
01:10:31,237 --> 01:10:33,280
- No, Morlocks.
- Wait.

537
01:10:33,782 --> 01:10:36,035
You mean those animals run machines?

538
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:38,329
They are Morlocks.

539
01:10:39,454 --> 01:10:43,751
- But, have you ever seen the machines?
- No, only heard of them.

540
01:10:44,628 --> 01:10:47,381
- But, who told you?
- The rings.

541
01:10:49,008 --> 01:10:51,928
- What sort of rings?
- Rings that talk.

542
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:56,433
Could you show me these talking rings?

543
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:08,739
Come, this way.

544
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,927
- These are the talking rings?
- Yes.

545
01:11:28,013 --> 01:11:29,222
They speak?

546
01:11:31,223 --> 01:11:32,601
Of what?

547
01:11:33,518 --> 01:11:35,979
Things no one here understands.

548
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:38,190
Make it talk.

549
01:11:42,987 --> 01:11:48,035
The war between the East and West,
which is now in its 326th year,..

550
01:11:48,494 --> 01:11:50,455
...has at last come to an end.

551
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,835
There is nothing left to fight with
and few of us left to fight.

552
01:11:55,252 --> 01:11:58,548
The atmosphere has become
so polluted with deadly germs...

553
01:11:58,799 --> 01:12:01,385
...that it can no longer be breathed.

554
01:12:01,636 --> 01:12:04,137
There is no place on
this planet that is immune.

555
01:12:04,805 --> 01:12:09,603
The last surviving factory for the manufacture
of oxygen has been destroyed.

556
01:12:10,312 --> 01:12:12,982
Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing...

557
01:12:13,274 --> 01:12:16,109
...and when they are gone,
we must die.

558
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:30,251
My name is of no consequence.

559
01:12:31,712 --> 01:12:37,468
The important thing you should know is
that I am the last who remembers how each of us...

560
01:12:37,844 --> 01:12:42,140
...man and woman,
made his own decision.

561
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:45,770
Some chose to take refuge
in the great caverns...

562
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,567
...and find a new way of life
far below the Earth's surface.

563
01:12:51,277 --> 01:12:55,532
The rest of us decided
to take our chances in the sunlight...

564
01:12:56,825 --> 01:12:59,912
...small as those chances might be.

565
01:13:01,121 --> 01:13:05,252
From the talking rings I learned
how the human race divided itself...

566
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:09,756
...and how the world of the Eloi
and the Morlocks began.

567
01:13:10,716 --> 01:13:14,137
By some awful quirk of fate...

568
01:13:14,387 --> 01:13:19,184
...the Morlocks had became the masters
and the Eloi - their servants.

569
01:13:19,477 --> 01:13:23,189
The Morlocks maintained them
and bred them like...

570
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,733
...like cattle...

571
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:28,321
...only to take them below
when they reached maturity.

572
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:31,741
Which explained why
there were no older people among them.

573
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:36,496
Now I knew I must go below. It was the only mean to finding
a way up into the Spfinx to reach my machine...

574
01:13:36,747 --> 01:13:40,043
...and find out what happened
to the little people when they did go below.

575
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:41,878
Don't go!

576
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:59,482
- You won't come back!
- l'll be back.

577
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,043
Weena?

578
01:14:58,677 --> 01:15:00,137
Weena, answer me!

579
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:01,972
Where are you?

580
01:15:29,881 --> 01:15:31,257
What's happening?

581
01:15:32,758 --> 01:15:34,135
What's happening?

582
01:15:35,345 --> 01:15:37,513
What's the matter with you all?

583
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,245
Weena, stop!

584
01:16:46,637 --> 01:16:47,889
Stop!

585
01:16:49,683 --> 01:16:51,435
Well, what happens to them?

586
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:59,027
Don't stand there like fatted cattle!
Will you answer me?

587
01:17:01,405 --> 01:17:06,202
- What is wrong?
- There is nothing wrong. lt is all clear.

588
01:17:09,123 --> 01:17:12,585
- What do you mean, all clear?
- All clear.

589
01:17:14,712 --> 01:17:19,593
ln the middle-1900s, the falling bombs,
the people calling out, "All clear!".

590
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:20,970
No!

591
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,306
That's gone! That's passed!

592
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:27,352
There are no more flying machines!
No more bombs! No more wars!

593
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:30,648
The rings have told us that story.

594
01:17:31,106 --> 01:17:34,319
But you didn't listen!
You didn't learn anything!

595
01:17:34,569 --> 01:17:39,116
lt was ages ago that men were taught
to hide below the ground when the sirens blew...

596
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:42,036
...to run from the reigning death, but it's over!

597
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:45,624
Those men are dead. The men who
slaughtered them are dead!

598
01:17:47,126 --> 01:17:50,672
But there is nothing to fear.
lt is all clear.

599
01:17:51,005 --> 01:17:55,761
What about the ones who went below?
How do you think they gonna come back?

600
01:17:56,679 --> 01:17:58,138
They never come back.

601
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:04,478
- Nobody can bring them back.
- You can try. You can try!

602
01:18:04,771 --> 01:18:07,608
Won't even one of you try?!

603
01:18:11,863 --> 01:18:13,489
Well, l'll try!

604
01:20:31,235 --> 01:20:34,281
So this was the destiny of the Eloi.

605
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:39,078
They were being bred
by the Morlocks...

606
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:43,250
... who had degenerated
into the lowest form of human life:

607
01:20:43,584 --> 01:20:44,835
Cannibalism!

608
01:22:31,626 --> 01:22:34,757
Weena, wake up! Come to your senses!
All of you!

609
01:24:06,156 --> 01:24:07,282
Burn.

610
01:24:07,782 --> 01:24:10,786
Give me something to burn.
lt's my last match.

611
01:24:19,839 --> 01:24:22,550
Get up the stairs!
That's the way out! Quickly!

612
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:31,713
The torch!

613
01:25:36,887 --> 01:25:38,681
Weenie, get the torch!

614
01:26:31,368 --> 01:26:34,288
Get up the steps! Hurry up!

615
01:28:17,451 --> 01:28:20,663
All right, get all the deadwood!
Come on! All the wood!

616
01:28:21,998 --> 01:28:24,835
That's fine. Come on, throw it down!

617
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:28,255
All the deadwood!

618
01:28:31,843 --> 01:28:35,056
Throw it down!
Do the same to the other wells!

619
01:28:35,516 --> 01:28:37,600
All the wood down the wells!

620
01:28:48,863 --> 01:28:52,202
All right, to the river!
Come on! Back to the river!

621
01:29:22,863 --> 01:29:24,698
All right, let's go!

622
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:36,253
Another night was coming, but
this night no Eloi needed to fear.

623
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:43,094
The underworld of the Morlocks
was gone...

624
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:46,389
...and so was the life of leisure
for the Eloi.

625
01:29:49,518 --> 01:29:51,061
But then what of me?

626
01:29:51,605 --> 01:29:54,315
I was imprisoned in a world...

627
01:29:54,565 --> 01:29:57,445
...in which I just did not belong.

628
01:29:59,404 --> 01:30:01,200
Are you sorry?

629
01:30:02,867 --> 01:30:06,788
- Sorry? Sorry for what?
- That you have to stay?

630
01:30:10,126 --> 01:30:11,419
Yes.

631
01:30:12,671 --> 01:30:15,882
I'm sorry because l could tell so much
to the people of my time, Weena.

632
01:30:16,425 --> 01:30:17,803
l could let them know...

633
01:30:18,637 --> 01:30:22,475
...about the sorrow and the happiness
that the future has installed for them.

634
01:30:22,724 --> 01:30:24,811
Maybe they could learn from it.

635
01:30:25,978 --> 01:30:27,354
Or could they?

636
01:30:30,317 --> 01:30:34,155
- You don't want to stay, do you?
- lt isn't that.

637
01:30:34,947 --> 01:30:39,535
lt's just that l don't really fit here
any more than you would in my time.

638
01:30:40,161 --> 01:30:42,706
l would love to see your time.

639
01:30:43,915 --> 01:30:46,253
You wouldn't be very happy there.

640
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:50,090
Do you have someone there?
Someone like me?

641
01:30:51,341 --> 01:30:52,969
No, no one like you.

642
01:30:56,263 --> 01:30:59,476
l have friends, of course, friends who'll miss me.

643
01:31:00,144 --> 01:31:02,020
As a matter of fact, l'm probably late already.

644
01:31:03,313 --> 01:31:04,607
Women?

645
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:07,944
No.

646
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:12,950
As a matter of fact, there is one woman.

647
01:31:14,244 --> 01:31:19,083
But she looks after my house for me.
And she's 62 years old and all wrinkled.

648
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:26,507
How do they wear their hair?

649
01:31:26,757 --> 01:31:28,885
- Who?
- The women of your time.

650
01:31:31,973 --> 01:31:34,350
- Up.
- Up?

651
01:31:36,477 --> 01:31:37,938
Up how?

652
01:31:38,771 --> 01:31:41,358
l don't know. Kind of...

653
01:31:42,109 --> 01:31:43,862
...up, like that.

654
01:31:44,946 --> 01:31:46,198
Show me!

655
01:32:00,798 --> 01:32:02,382
Would l be pretty?

656
01:32:04,928 --> 01:32:07,681
Yes, you would. Very pretty.

657
01:32:11,852 --> 01:32:14,355
Oh, Weena, l wish we could go back to my time.

658
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:18,194
Or even into time before that,
when the world was young.

659
01:32:18,444 --> 01:32:21,489
- We could be so very happy.
- Look!

660
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:43,390
My machine!

661
01:32:45,141 --> 01:32:46,602
Come on, Weena!

662
01:34:06,112 --> 01:34:10,868
I was going the wrong way!
Back! I had to go back!

663
01:36:12,052 --> 01:36:16,266
Well, lt's the most ridiculous story
l've ever heard. Absolutely preposterous!

664
01:36:16,724 --> 01:36:20,436
Well, there's one thing I'll say for you, George,
you always could tell a good yarn.

665
01:36:20,688 --> 01:36:23,358
You're a truly great inventor, George.

666
01:36:24,526 --> 01:36:26,904
l think you ought to retire, sir.

667
01:36:28,655 --> 01:36:32,785
Truthfully, George,
where have you been the past week?

668
01:36:33,035 --> 01:36:35,163
You shouldn't ask such questions.

669
01:36:35,414 --> 01:36:39,376
lt's not hard for a man
to lose a little week now and again.

670
01:36:41,753 --> 01:36:45,676
l can understand your doubt, my friends.
Take it as a lie if you wish.

671
01:36:46,927 --> 01:36:50,014
l scarcely believe it myself,
now that l'm back.

672
01:36:56,647 --> 01:36:59,735
David, there's the flower
Weena gave me.

673
01:37:01,777 --> 01:37:04,782
A present for you.
You were always interested in botany.

674
01:37:05,032 --> 01:37:07,701
Try and match that
with any species known today!

675
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:14,834
l don't think l can.

676
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,550
Well, time to go, Bridewell.

677
01:37:21,052 --> 01:37:24,179
- Yes, it is getting late.
- Good night, George.

678
01:37:24,429 --> 01:37:25,806
Good night, George.

679
01:37:31,562 --> 01:37:35,067
You look exhausted, George.
You really should get some rest.

680
01:37:59,929 --> 01:38:02,431
Good night, George.
lt's grand having you back.

681
01:38:03,183 --> 01:38:04,393
Goodbye, David.

682
01:38:13,238 --> 01:38:16,908
Thanks for being such a good friend, David.
Always.

683
01:38:32,302 --> 01:38:34,137
What do you think, Filby?

684
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,222
One thing is certain.

685
01:38:36,431 --> 01:38:39,435
That flower couldn't possibly
have bloomed in the wintertime.

686
01:38:39,685 --> 01:38:42,521
You don't really believe that story is true, do you?

687
01:38:43,772 --> 01:38:45,066
Good night.

688
01:38:46,902 --> 01:38:48,278
Go on, driver.

689
01:39:36,044 --> 01:39:39,088
- Mr. Filby, what..?
- He's gone!

690
01:39:41,132 --> 01:39:42,592
Why, look!

691
01:39:51,645 --> 01:39:55,316
l think l understand.
You see the imprint?

692
01:39:56,442 --> 01:39:59,612
This is where the time machine originally stood.

693
01:39:59,989 --> 01:40:01,906
But the Morlocks moved it.

694
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:05,578
They dragged it across the lawn...

695
01:40:05,869 --> 01:40:08,790
...right into the Sphinx.
Right there.

696
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:15,298
And Weena was standing here
when he last saw her.

697
01:40:15,548 --> 01:40:20,053
Right here! The same space
in a different time.

698
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:25,643
So he dragged his heavy machine
back in here...

699
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,105
...scratching the floor...

700
01:40:29,105 --> 01:40:32,192
...so that he could appear
outside the sphinx again...

701
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:36,113
...and help the Eloi
build a new world.

702
01:40:37,617 --> 01:40:40,493
Build a new world for himself.

703
01:40:41,996 --> 01:40:44,875
- Right where he left her.
- Yes.

704
01:40:55,762 --> 01:40:59,474
lt's not like George
to return empty-handed.

705
01:40:59,766 --> 01:41:03,103
To try to rebuild a civilization
without a plan.

706
01:41:04,105 --> 01:41:06,775
He must have taken something with him.

707
01:41:08,778 --> 01:41:10,237
Nothing.

708
01:41:17,329 --> 01:41:21,041
- Except three books.
- Which three books?

709
01:41:21,918 --> 01:41:25,130
l don't know. ls it important?

710
01:41:26,924 --> 01:41:28,467
l suppose not.

711
01:41:30,136 --> 01:41:31,263
Only...

712
01:41:32,264 --> 01:41:34,933
...which three books would you have taken?

713
01:41:41,525 --> 01:41:44,735
Mr. Filby, do you think he'll ever return?

714
01:41:45,404 --> 01:41:47,573
One cannot choose but wonder.

715
01:41:47,824 --> 01:41:51,869
You see, he has all the time
in the world.
