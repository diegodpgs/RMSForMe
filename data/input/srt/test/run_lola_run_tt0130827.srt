1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,649
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring

2
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:29,445
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.

00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,951
After the game is before the game.

5
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,112
<i>Man...</i>

6
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:58,450
<i>... probably the most mysterious
species on our planet.</i>

7
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:01,619
<i>A mystery of unanswered questions...</i>

8
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,915
<i>Who are we? Where do we come from?</i>

9
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:10,962
<i>Where are we going? How do we
know. What we think we know?</i>

10
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:15,383
<i>Why do we believe anything at all?</i>

11
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:19,720
<i>Countless questions
In search of an answer.</i>

12
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:25,101
<i>An answer that will give
rise to a new question...</i>

13
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:28,896
<i>... and the next answer will give
rise to the next question and so on...</i>

14
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:31,148
<i>... and so on.</i>

15
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:36,987
<i>But, In the end, Isn’t 't It
always the same question?</i>

16
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:41,742
<i>And always the same answer?</i>

17
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:47,373
The ball is round.
The game lasts 90 minutes.

18
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,126
That's a fact. Everything
else is pure theory.

19
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:53,712
Here we go!

20
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,554
RUN LOLA RUN

21
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:50,410
- Manni?
- Lola?

22
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:52,746
What's up? Where are you?

23
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,582
Where were you, damn it?

24
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:57,292
I got there too late.

25
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,462
But why today?
You're always on time! Always!

26
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:04,049
My moped got ripped off.
It doesn't matter.

27
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:05,216
Yes, it matters!

28
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,427
What's wrong?

29
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:11,431
<i>It wasn't my fault, Manni.
I went to get some cigarettes.</i>

30
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:14,601
<i>I can 't believe how fast the guy was.</i>

31
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,272
<i>There was nothing I could do.
He was gone before I got outside.</i>

32
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:20,732
<i>I even took a taxi.</i>

33
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:24,235
<i>That dumb-ass drove east. They've
got a Grunewald St. There too.</i>

34
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,571
<i>When I noticed, It was too late.</i>

35
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:31,117
<i>I was so screwed up because
of our moped, I didn't realize.</i>

36
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,786
<i>- Doesn't matter. - And when
I got there, you were gone.</i>

37
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:37,331
<i>- It doesn't matter now.
I'm done for. - But why?</i>

38
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:43,546
Help me, Lola! I don't know what to do.

39
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:47,717
You weren't there, and I messed
it up. I blew it. I'm such a jerk!

40
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:52,179
<i>Just calm down. Now, what happened?</i>

41
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:55,891
<i>Just tell me what happened, okay?</i>

42
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:58,435
Lola, he's gonna kill me. I'm gonna die.

43
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,106
Stop it! You're scaring me. What's up?

44
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:05,693
<i>- Did you get caught? - No, but
that would have been something.</i>

45
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:10,781
<i>Everything went really great. We drove
the cars there, and those guys came.</i>

46
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:13,826
<i>They paid and that was lt. Easy as pie.</i>

47
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:16,995
<i>I got waved across the border...</i>

48
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:19,748
<i>... and then they dropped me off out there.</i>

49
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:23,710
<i>I went to see that cyclops,
and he was finished In no time.</i>

50
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:26,171
<i>And everything was on time,
except for you.</i>

51
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,465
<i>You weren't thnoeroe</i>

52
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:34,346
- Then what?
- Nothing. Not even a phone booth.

53
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:39,309
<i>I couldn’t 't even call a taxi,
so I walked to the subway station</i>

54
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:41,603
<i>On the train, there was this bum...</i>

55
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,231
<i>... who somehow fell down. Suddenly,
these Inspectors showed up.</i>

56
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:48,943
<i>And I got out like always.
An old reflex.</i>

57
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,372
The bag!

58
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:02,373
The bag!

59
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:37,074
The bag!

60
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:41,495
I'm such a fucking amateur!
A dumb-ass!

61
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:46,166
<i>This could only happen to me! If you'd
picked me up, It wouldn’t 't have happened.</i>

62
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,420
<i>I was so out of lt.
You're always on time!</i>

63
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,381
<i>- Didn't you call the next station? - Sure.</i>

64
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:56,093
<i>But It was too late. The
fucking bag was already gone.</i>

65
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,387
<i>And that bum has lt.
That plastic-bag freak!</i>

66
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:01,848
<i>He 's on a plane to Florida or Hawaii...</i>

67
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:05,769
<i>... or Canada or Hong
Kongor Bermuda or whatever.</i>

68
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:10,482
<i>What about Ronnie?</i>

69
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:13,193
<i>- He'll kill me. - You gotta tell him.</i>

70
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:14,194
<i>Forget it!</i>

71
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:16,196
- Why? - He won't believe a single word!

72
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:20,492
<i>I kept a carton of cigarettes
once. He noticed right away.</i>

73
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,495
<i>He doesn 't believe anybody.</i>

74
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:27,374
The job with those Mercedes
was a kind of test.

75
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:31,711
To see if he could trust me. Shit.

76
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:34,631
How much was there in the bag?

77
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:37,926
- 100.000
- What?

78
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,554
100.000. A test.

79
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:42,889
Shit.

80
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:47,101
<i>See! I knew you wouldn’t 't come up
with any Ideas. I always said...</i>

81
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:50,188
...someday you wouldn't know what
to do. Not when you die. Sooner!

82
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:55,902
<i>You said, ''Love can do everything.''
So find 100.000 marks in 20 minutes!</i>

83
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:02,325
At 12 by the water tower around
the corner, Ronnie said. In 20 minutes.

84
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,784
Run away, Manni!

85
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,161
<i>- No.
- Why not?</i>

86
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,456
Nobody escapes Ronnie.

87
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:09,665
I'll go with you.

88
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,335
When Ronnie gets here in 20 minutes
I'll be a goner.

89
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,670
- Stop it, Manni!
- What for?

90
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,798
You can't get me 100 grand either!

91
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:21,927
He'll rub me out, and all that's
left of me will be 100.000 ashes...

92
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:26,890
...floating down the Spree to the sea.
No more Manni! You can't do a thing!

93
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:28,725
Shut up!

94
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:39,569
Listen.

95
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:44,658
Wait for me. I'll help you. Stay put,
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

96
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:47,035
<i>- Okay?
- You gonna pawn all your jewelry?</i>

97
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:47,953
Where are you?

98
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:52,916
In a phone booth downtown
in front of the Spiral Bar.

99
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,503
Okay, stay where you are.
I'll come up with something.

100
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:58,213
In 20 minutes, okay?

101
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,842
What the hell. I'll go over to
Bolleand get that 100 grand.

102
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,844
C cut it out!

103
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:08,264
Ronnie said they make 200 grand a day
so they must have 100 grand by noon.

104
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:12,268
<i>You're nuts! Don 't do a thing!
Just stay In that damned booth!</i>

105
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:15,313
- That's it. I'll rob the store.
- Have you lost it?

106
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:18,107
Don't do a thing! Stay put, I'm coming!

107
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,609
Then what?

108
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:21,194
I'll think of something!

109
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,447
In 20 minutes I'll be dead
unless I steal the money!

110
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,491
- No, wait!
- What for?

111
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:29,410
I'll get the money somehow.

112
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:34,582
I'm going there at 12
if you aren't here.

113
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:04,236
Okay. Who?

114
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,738
Who?

115
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:43,149
Dad!

116
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,202
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo!

117
00:11:57,121 --> 00:12:00,458
Of course, I knew that
Sagittarius was your ascendant.

118
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:05,505
Sure, the more I think about it.
I don't know.

119
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:09,634
Yes, but you're married too.

120
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:07,315
Watch where you're going!

121
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:11,653
Bitch!

122
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:19,136
It's worst at night.

123
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,681
I wake up and can't fall asleep again.

124
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:25,142
And then I'm afraid.

125
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,353
Me! Afraid of the dark!

126
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:33,317
I've never been afraid of the dark.
I've never even been afraid before.

127
00:14:35,193 --> 00:14:36,987
But I think about us...

128
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:44,161
...and I just think
it'll keep going on like this.

129
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,830
That you wouldn't dare...

130
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,634
And then I ask myself
what I'm doing here.

131
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:04,973
How long will this go on?
The secrecy, all this damned lying?

132
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:10,478
Should I grow old, waiting for a man
who won't stand by me?

133
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,392
Hey, you need a bike?

134
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,229
50 marks, as good as new.

135
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,356
No!

136
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:00,402
AND THEN

137
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:50,159
Hey man! I know that!

138
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,329
It's not my fault it's so much money!

139
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,504
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

140
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:18,771
Thanks.

141
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:31,867
Your phone card!

142
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:55,891
I have to go. Meyer will be
here in a minute.

143
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:02,480
Ca n we nm eet ate r on?

144
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,151
- Do you love me?
- What?

145
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,445
Do you love me?

146
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:11,114
Why are you asking me now?

147
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,283
Do you love me?

148
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,994
Yes, damn it!

149
00:18:17,036 --> 00:18:18,037
Then decide.

150
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:20,623
Not now.

151
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:23,293
You have to decide sometime.

152
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:26,337
But why now, here, at once?

153
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:34,512
Because I'm pregnant.

154
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:46,190
Look who's here!

155
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:50,444
Our little princess, Lola!
What a rare pleasure.

156
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:53,489
- Why the rush?
- Please, let me in.

157
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:57,785
Little Miss wants to see Big Daddy?
Sure thing.

158
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:10,589
Sorry.

159
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:14,510
AND THEN

160
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:26,521
Tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?

161
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:32,152
Yes.

162
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,365
Lola?

163
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:38,783
Dad.

164
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,869
Your daughter?

165
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:50,336
I'm Jutta Hansen
from the board of directors.

166
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,008
- Sorry to interrupt. It's urgent.
- It's okay. I was just about to...

167
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:58,636
What are you doing here?

168
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,013
What are you doing here?

169
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:05,810
Nothing.

170
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:15,444
Listen...

171
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:19,073
...if I told you I needed your help...

172
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:23,744
...more than I ever have before and
you're the only one who can help me...

173
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,913
...would you help me?
- You look terrible.

174
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,832
- Would you help me?
- What happened?

175
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,751
I can't explain now.
Would you help me?

176
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:31,919
With what, damn it?!

177
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:35,256
I need 100.000 marks immediately.

178
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:36,590
What?

179
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:40,469
I need it within
the next five minutes or else...

180
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:43,138
- Or else what?
- Something terrible will happen!

181
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:46,517
I don't understand.
What's going on here today?

182
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:49,770
Please, Dad! You've got to help me! Please!

183
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:52,898
- I don't have 100.000 marks.
- What about my life insurance?

184
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:56,109
What about it?
It isn't worth 100.000

185
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:59,696
Please, Dad, I'm serious.
This isn't a joke!

186
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:02,491
Yes, it is, Lola!
You can't be serious!

187
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:05,285
- If you don't help me, he'll die!
- Who'll die?

188
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:07,788
- Manni!
- Manni? Who's Manni?

189
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:09,956
My boyfriend, for over a year!

190
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:12,334
I don't even know him.
Why will he die?

191
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:13,835
It doesn't matter!

192
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:24,554
Okay. Come with me.

193
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:35,732
- You're going to help me?
- Of course.

194
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:38,610
Go home and go to bed.

195
00:21:39,193 --> 00:21:44,032
And tell your mother I won't be
home today or tomorrow or ever again.

196
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:48,035
I'm leaving you guys
and I'm marrying another woman.

197
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:53,332
We're going to have kids. I'll try to be
happy because she only wants me.

198
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,752
<i>I'm so sick of hearing
''All you do is work.''</i>

199
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:58,754
<i>''You always play the boss!''</i>

200
00:21:58,838 --> 00:22:02,508
Maybe I do, but so what!
You guys have no idea!

201
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:06,303
I'm so tired of being
blamed for everything!

202
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:10,099
Sure, Daddy's money is good enough
right? Well, not anymore!

203
00:22:10,182 --> 00:22:11,308
Not anymore.

204
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:18,148
Besides, I'd never have
fathered a freak like you.

205
00:22:18,565 --> 00:22:21,068
- But you did, you jerk!
- No, I didn't!

206
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,490
You're not mine.

207
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:34,998
Now you know.

208
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:41,505
The guy who sired you left
before you were even born.

209
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:44,341
Throw her out, please.

210
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:49,638
Come on! Get h e r out of h e re!

211
00:23:23,046 --> 00:23:25,298
Well, we all have our bad days.

212
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:29,886
See you around.

213
00:23:43,274 --> 00:23:44,567
My dear.

214
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:46,318
What's wrong?

215
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:48,988
Do you have the time?

216
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:33,031
This afternoon?

217
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:36,826
All right.

218
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:39,579
No, forget it. It's okay.

219
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,706
Yeah.

220
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:16,466
<i>Walt!</i>

221
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:19,135
<i>Don 't do it!</i>

222
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:21,429
<i>Manni, please!</i>

223
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:22,263
<i>Walt!</i>

224
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,517
<i>Walt for me!</i>

225
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,186
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

226
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:29,979
<i>Please.</i>

227
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:32,357
<i>Manni, please...</i>

228
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:34,776
<i>... wait!</i>

229
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:23,240
Lie down on the floor. On the floor!

230
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:25,242
Lie down on the floor.

231
00:27:31,206 --> 00:27:33,250
Hands behind your head, and keep quiet!

232
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:35,252
Hands behind your head, and keep quiet!

233
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:37,462
Open the registers!

234
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:41,007
Open all the cash registers!
Open them!

235
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:45,011
Open them, and lie down!

236
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:48,473
I'll shoot anyone who bugs me!

237
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,810
I'll shoot anyone who bugs me!

238
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,275
Lola, where were you?

239
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:01,444
I couldn't get here faster.

240
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:03,112
Will you help me?

241
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:05,240
Can't we just get out of here?

242
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,076
Not anymore. You see the shit I'm in.

243
00:28:10,244 --> 00:28:12,205
Why didn't you wait for me?

244
00:28:12,622 --> 00:28:14,749
I did. You got here too late.

245
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:17,752
So, are you with me?

246
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,671
Put your hands up! Hurry up!

247
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:26,719
Come on!

248
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:32,183
Drop your gun!

249
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:33,893
Hurry up!

250
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:41,442
Don't move.

251
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:44,111
The safety is on.

252
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:46,947
- How does it work?
- The little lever on the side.

253
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:50,701
Kid, you don't know how to use...

254
00:28:54,872 --> 00:28:55,539
Don't move.

255
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:00,460
Come here

256
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:07,551
Cover me. I'll grab the cash.

257
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:23,149
Hurry, before the cops come.

258
00:30:16,744 --> 00:30:17,828
Don't move!

259
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:55,257
Do you love me?

260
00:31:58,385 --> 00:31:59,678
Sure, I do.

261
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:05,017
How can you be sure?

262
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,688
I don't know. I just am.

263
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:12,733
I could be some other girl.

264
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:17,029
Why not?

265
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:21,992
- Because you're the best.
- The best what?

266
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:23,952
The best girl.

267
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,247
In the whole world?

268
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:29,708
Sure.

269
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:31,418
How do you know?

270
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:35,547
I just know.

271
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:39,050
You think so.

272
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:43,013
Okay, I think so.

273
00:32:43,888 --> 00:32:45,932
- You see?
- What?

274
00:32:46,683 --> 00:32:47,726
You aren't sure.

275
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:51,271
Are you nuts, or what?

276
00:32:57,193 --> 00:32:59,487
What if you never met me?

277
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,573
What do you mean?

278
00:33:04,951 --> 00:33:07,578
You'd be saying the same
thing to someone else.

279
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:11,707
- Okay, if you don't want to hear it...
- I don't want to hear anything.

280
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,292
I want to know how you feel.

281
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,378
Okay.

282
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:17,838
My feelings say...

283
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:21,425
...you're the best.

284
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:25,888
<i>Your feelings?
Who is ''your feelings'' anyway?</i>

285
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:27,640
It's me.

286
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:31,811
My heart.

287
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:34,605
<i>Your heart says
'' Hi, Manni. She's the one. ''</i>

288
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:37,274
Exactly.

289
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:40,986
<i>And you say, '' Thanks for the info.
Talk to you soon. ''</i>

290
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:42,404
Exactly.

291
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:46,200
And you do whatever your heart says?

292
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:49,411
<i>Well, it doesn't really ''say'' anything.</i>

293
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,205
I don't know...

294
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:53,749
...it just feels.

295
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:57,502
So what does it feel now?

296
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,006
That someone's asking
rather stupid questions.

297
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:04,384
You aren't taking me seriously.

298
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:06,470
Lola, what's wrong?

299
00:34:07,637 --> 00:34:09,347
Do you want to...

300
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:11,600
...leave me?

301
00:34:14,394 --> 00:34:15,812
I don't know.

302
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,902
I think I have to make a decision.

303
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,874
But I don't want to...

304
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,794
I don't want to leave.

305
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:47,885
Stop!

306
00:34:54,642 --> 00:34:57,520
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

307
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,359
Of course, I knew that
Sagittarius was your ascendant.

308
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:07,780
Sure, the more I think about it.
I don't know.

309
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:12,117
Yes, but you're married too.

310
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:20,935
Excuse me!

311
00:36:21,352 --> 00:36:23,229
Watch it, you stupid cow!

312
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:26,607
Fucking bitch!

313
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:27,984
AND THEN

314
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,593
Hey, you need a bike?

315
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:38,720
No.

316
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:41,389
- 50 marks, as good as new.
- But it's stolen!

317
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,448
500? What am I supposed to do
with 500 marks?

318
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:40,656
Tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?

319
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:47,412
Yes.

320
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:00,467
Even if it isn't yours?

321
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:08,308
Look who's here! Lola, our...

322
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:09,935
I'm in a hurry, please!

323
00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:13,271
Please let me in!

324
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:16,733
Courtesy and composure are
the queen's jewels.

325
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:18,151
Let me in, please.

326
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:21,237
A little anger is good for the heart...

327
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:24,157
...the circulation, the skin.

328
00:39:47,305 --> 00:39:49,056
What kind of love is that?!

329
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:52,643
- If you hadn't neglected me...
- I have a family!

330
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,189
I can't leave a sick wife and three
kids just to please her highness.

331
00:39:57,606 --> 00:39:59,400
Your wife is drunk
from morning to night!

332
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:01,193
So what!

333
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:02,069
What do you know?

334
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:05,155
Can't you see you're interrupting?

335
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:11,286
Hi, Dad.

336
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:13,789
Why didn't you knock?

337
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:16,750
What's going on?

338
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,043
What do you want?

339
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:20,212
Is she your daughter?

340
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:21,839
Shut the door.

341
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:28,595
What do you want?

342
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:29,972
I need your help.

343
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:33,725
- You see that I'm busy.
- There's no other way.

344
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:37,270
Damn it! Why did you
have to show up here now?!

345
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:39,648
I have a problem.
Do you understand?

346
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,986
Who's that slut?

347
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:46,529
That's none of your business!

348
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,957
Lola, leave.

349
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,459
Go home.

350
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:01,836
Leave me alone.

351
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:03,922
I can't!

352
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:05,298
Why not?

353
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:07,592
I need money.

354
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,428
Then get a job.

355
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:13,514
I will, but I need the money now!

356
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,436
Okay, just so you get out of here.
How much?

357
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:20,938
No, I need lots more.

358
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:22,440
<i>What do you mean, ''lots more''?</i>

359
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:24,984
A whole lot more!

360
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:29,655
Aren't you ashamed barging in like
this? Can't you see we're busy?

361
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,907
I don't give a shit, you stupid cow!
I have other problems.

362
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:35,911
Don't you dare...

363
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:06,483
What?

364
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,753
What's going on?

365
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,965
It just isn't your day today.
Doesn't matter.

366
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,384
You can't have everything.

367
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,715
You're coming with me.

368
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,719
Have you lost your mind?

369
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,598
- You think you can do anything you like?
- Shut up! You go first.

370
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,349
Kid...

371
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,728
...you don't know how to
use that thing.

372
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,481
Let me make a suggestion.

373
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:53,171
Stay back.

374
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,010
- Listen, we can talk this over.
- Fuck off!

375
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,391
AND THEN

376
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:14,234
Shit!

377
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:15,860
The combination.

378
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:21,115
Quiet!

379
00:44:27,455 --> 00:44:29,665
What the heck are you doing?

380
00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:56,609
Lola, there are cameras everywhere.
You'll never get out of here.

381
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:59,069
The police will be here in a second.

382
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:01,989
You said they always come too late.

383
00:45:02,948 --> 00:45:05,409
Bag it. 100.000

384
00:45:16,003 --> 00:45:17,504
Come on, kid.

385
00:45:18,922 --> 00:45:20,841
Leave your daddy alone.

386
00:45:21,883 --> 00:45:23,593
You don't want to
hurt anyone, do you?

387
00:45:24,803 --> 00:45:26,012
I don't know.

388
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:45,448
- I don't have it.
- Why not?

389
00:45:47,242 --> 00:45:49,119
There's only 88.000

390
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:53,748
I'll have to get the
rest from downstairs.

391
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:56,709
Okay, get going!

392
00:45:58,253 --> 00:45:58,962
Go, go!

393
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,923
Hurry up, man!

394
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:00,897
100.000

395
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:05,777
In there.

396
00:47:34,347 --> 00:47:35,473
Bye, Dad.

397
00:47:56,786 --> 00:47:57,662
I don't believe it.

398
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:22,061
You want to get killed, kid?

399
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:31,445
Attention! This is the police!

400
00:48:31,904 --> 00:48:35,324
The building is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.

401
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:39,202
What a ruckus!

402
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:40,537
Do you have the time?

403
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,446
Get out of the way!

404
00:49:17,365 --> 00:49:19,200
Give me a lift, will you?

405
00:49:19,617 --> 00:49:22,120
- Are you nuts?
- Wait!

406
00:50:29,102 --> 00:50:31,855
<i>Walt, Manni! I'm coming.</i>

407
00:50:32,272 --> 00:50:33,565
<i>I'm almost there...</i>

408
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,150
<i>Walt!</i>

409
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:40,155
<i>I'm gonna make it!</i>

410
00:52:41,816 --> 00:52:43,985
What would you do if I died?

411
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:47,405
- I wouldn't let you die.
- Yeah, but...

412
00:52:48,823 --> 00:52:51,242
...what if I were fatally ill?

413
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:53,786
- I'd find a way.
- What if I were in a coma...

414
00:52:54,203 --> 00:52:56,997
<i>...and the doctor said
''One more day''?</i>

415
00:52:57,415 --> 00:52:59,667
I'd throw you into the ocean.
Shock therapy.

416
00:53:00,084 --> 00:53:02,169
Okay, but what if I died anyway?

417
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:07,466
- What do you want to hear?
- Come on, tell me.

418
00:53:08,759 --> 00:53:11,595
I'd go to the isle of Rügen
and cast your ashes to the wind.

419
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:12,179
And then?

420
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,850
I don't know. It's a stupid question.

421
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:18,811
I know what you'd do.

422
00:53:20,062 --> 00:53:22,272
- You'd forget me.
- No!

423
00:53:22,689 --> 00:53:25,484
Sure, you would.
What else could you do?

424
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:28,862
Sure, you'd mourn for a few weeks.

425
00:53:29,279 --> 00:53:33,325
It wouldn't be so bad.
Everybody's real compassionate.

426
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:38,205
And everything's so incredibly sad,
and everyone feels sorry for you.

427
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:41,791
You can show everyone how strong you are.

428
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:44,336
<i>''What a great woman, '' they'll say.</i>

429
00:53:44,419 --> 00:53:47,756
<i>''She's pulling herself together
instead of crying all day. ''</i>

430
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:53,344
And suddenly, this really nice
guy with green eyes shows up.

431
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:56,514
And he's super sensitive
and listens to you all day.

432
00:53:56,931 --> 00:53:58,975
And you can talk his ear off.

433
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:02,437
And you can tell him how tough
things are for you...

434
00:54:02,854 --> 00:54:07,608
...that you have to look after yourself
and you don't know what'll happen...

435
00:54:10,111 --> 00:54:13,990
Then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me
off your list. That's how it goes.

436
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:18,286
What?

437
00:54:18,703 --> 00:54:20,538
You're not dead yet.

438
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:32,007
No?

439
00:54:47,606 --> 00:54:50,359
Lola, are you going shopping?
I need shampoo.

440
00:54:53,195 --> 00:54:55,405
Of course, I knew that
Sagittarius was your ascendant.

441
00:54:56,657 --> 00:55:01,620
Sure, the more I think about it.
I don't know.

442
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:05,248
Yes, but you're married too.

443
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:57,091
AND THEN

444
00:56:56,775 --> 00:56:59,694
- Watch out!
- Sorry.

445
00:56:59,778 --> 00:57:01,780
I bet you're sorry!

446
00:57:21,758 --> 00:57:23,343
Fries and a sausage.

447
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,552
Give me another one.

448
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:31,726
I'll be damned.

449
00:57:32,727 --> 00:57:34,687
Life's really crazy
sometimes isn't it?

450
00:57:38,024 --> 00:57:40,109
Come on, kid.
I'll buy you a drink.

451
00:57:43,487 --> 00:57:44,363
You need a bike?

452
00:57:46,782 --> 00:57:48,909
A special price. 70 marks.

453
00:58:07,886 --> 00:58:08,846
Mr. Meyer?

454
00:58:09,263 --> 00:58:11,056
Is everything okay?

455
00:58:40,835 --> 00:58:44,339
Tell me, do you want to
have a baby with me?

456
00:58:48,051 --> 00:58:49,135
Yes.

457
00:58:53,348 --> 00:58:54,641
<i>Mr. Meyer Is here.</i>

458
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:58,102
- There's something else.
- Not now.

459
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:00,855
<i>Mr. Meyer asked If he should
park or If you're coming out?</i>

460
00:59:01,272 --> 00:59:02,648
I'm coming.

461
00:59:03,316 --> 00:59:06,069
This is the nicest present
you could give me.

462
00:59:13,034 --> 00:59:14,368
I'll see you later?

463
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,136
Hi there.

464
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,353
- Hi there, Ms. Jäger.
- Hello.

465
01:00:31,736 --> 01:00:33,905
- Nice to see you.
- Hello, Mr. Meyer.

466
01:00:49,795 --> 01:00:51,672
Wait!

467
01:00:53,591 --> 01:00:57,845
You know what?
I just had a strange encounter.

468
01:00:58,471 --> 01:00:59,305
Yes, with your daughter!

469
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,558
- With whom?
- Your daughter.

470
01:01:06,604 --> 01:01:08,689
Shit! Shit!

471
01:01:24,538 --> 01:01:25,414
You've come at last, dear.

472
01:01:56,569 --> 01:01:57,570
Thanks.

473
01:01:58,071 --> 01:01:59,197
Wait.

474
01:02:27,975 --> 01:02:30,436
So I decided, it'd be best
for me not to have kids.

475
01:02:30,853 --> 01:02:33,105
I work so much that
they'd never see me.

476
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:39,487
Watch out!

477
01:03:12,894 --> 01:03:14,313
<i>What can I do?</i>

478
01:03:15,439 --> 01:03:16,940
<i>What can I do?</i>

479
01:03:18,984 --> 01:03:20,610
<i>What can I do?</i>

480
01:03:30,787 --> 01:03:31,955
<i>Come on.</i>

481
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:35,834
<i>Help me.</i>

482
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:38,837
<i>Please.</i>

483
01:03:41,089 --> 01:03:42,715
<i>Just this once.</i>

484
01:03:45,093 --> 01:03:46,928
<i>I'll just keep running, okay?</i>

485
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:54,102
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

486
01:03:55,895 --> 01:03:57,188
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

487
01:03:58,564 --> 01:03:59,857
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

488
01:04:01,484 --> 01:04:02,693
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

489
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:12,787
You wanna get killed?

490
01:04:46,904 --> 01:04:49,239
- How does this work?
- You buy chips...

491
01:04:49,323 --> 01:04:50,657
...and gamble them away.

492
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:56,621
You can't go in there like that.

493
01:04:56,705 --> 01:04:57,789
I have to.

494
01:04:59,332 --> 01:05:02,169
99 marks 20. What kind of chips?

495
01:05:03,086 --> 01:05:03,879
One for 100.

496
01:05:05,213 --> 01:05:06,548
You're short.

497
01:05:07,465 --> 01:05:08,717
Please.

498
01:05:44,252 --> 01:05:46,629
Place your bets, please.

499
01:05:54,345 --> 01:05:56,138
Your bets, please.

500
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:08,692
No more bets.

501
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,620
Twenty, black, even, pass.
No series.

502
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:27,336
1.500 on black.

503
01:06:33,967 --> 01:06:36,636
100 and 400.

504
01:06:40,182 --> 01:06:44,060
3.500 for 100 marks on 20.

505
01:06:49,232 --> 01:06:51,192
Here you are. 3.500.

506
01:07:04,956 --> 01:07:05,957
Come with me, please.

507
01:07:11,212 --> 01:07:12,713
Just one more game

508
01:07:21,764 --> 01:07:23,307
Please place your bets.

509
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:33,626
Twenty, black, even, pass.

510
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:41,718
Please hurry.

511
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:43,970
I need a plastic bag.

512
01:09:36,355 --> 01:09:37,439
Stop!

513
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,043
That's mine!

514
01:09:58,126 --> 01:09:59,502
I know!

515
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:13,183
I'm sorry.

516
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,059
What about me?

517
01:10:20,273 --> 01:10:22,233
At least give me that.

518
01:11:31,218 --> 01:11:32,302
What're you doing here?

519
01:11:57,201 --> 01:11:58,536
I'll stay with him.

520
01:15:08,681 --> 01:15:10,433
What happened to you?

521
01:15:12,852 --> 01:15:14,270
Did you run here?

522
01:15:16,147 --> 01:15:18,858
Don't worry. Everything's okay.
Come on.

523
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:33,956
What's in the bag?
