<i>Cole, James.</i>

2
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,871
-Jose, what's going on?
- Bad news, man.

3
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,635
- Volunteers?
- Yeah. And they said your name.

4
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,069
Maybe they'll give you
a pardon, man.

5
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,914
Yeah. That's why none of the volunteers
come back. They all get a pardon.

6
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,719
Some come back, I heard.

7
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,639
Please put me back!
Don't take me!

8
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,710
They got 'em up on the seventh floor.
They hide 'em up there.

9
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,756
They're all messed up in the head.

10
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,479
You don't know they're all messed up.
Nobody's seen 'em.

11
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,869
And maybe they're not messed up.
That's a rumour. Nobody knows that.

12
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,269
I don't believe that.

13
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,277
Good luck, man.

14
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,433
- Volunteer duty!
- I didn't volunteer.

15
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,080
You causing trouble again?

16
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,232
No, no trouble.

James Cole
cleared from quarantine.

30
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,917
Thank you.
You two wait outside.

31
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,673
He's got a history, Doctor.
Violence.

32
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,955
Antisocial six.

33
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,271
Repeated violations of
the Permanent Emergency Code.

34
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,191
Insolence. Defiance.

35
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,998
Disregard of authority.

36
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,116
Doing 25 to life.

37
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,350
I don't think
he's gonna hurt us.

38
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,432
You aren't gonna hurt us,
are you, Mr Cole?

39
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,397
No, sir.

40
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,877
Why don't you sit down,
Mr Cole?

41
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,230
We appreciate your volunteering.
You're a very good observer.

42
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,437
- Thank you.
- We have a very advanced programme.

43
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,479
- Something very different.
- A chance to reduce your sentence.

44
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,676
And possibly play
an important role...

45
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,228
in returning the human race
to the surface of the Earth.

46
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,995
We want tough-minded people.
Strong mentally.

47
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,917
We've had some misfortunes
with unstable types.

48
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,958
For a man in your position,
an opportunity.

49
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,878
Not to volunteer
could be a real mistake.

50
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,599
Definitely a mistake.

51
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,754
"Yet among
the myriad microwaves...

52
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,231
the infrared messages,
the gigabytes of ones and zeros...

53
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,039
we find words, byte-sized now...

54
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,395
tinier even than science...

55
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,153
lurking in some
vague electricity.

56
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,356
But if we but listen...

57
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,637
we hear the solitary voice
of that poet telling us...

58
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,433
yesterday this day's madness
did prepare...

59
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,310
tomorrow's silent
triumph of despair.

60
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,870
Drink, for you know not
whence you came, nor why.

61
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,111
Drink, for you know not
why you go, nor where.''

62
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,870
Wandering around in nothing
but his underpants...

63
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,236
and one of those plastic,
see-through lady's raincoats.

64
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,949
So, they get there, they ask the guy
real nice for some kind of ID.

65
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,998
He gets agitated,
starts screaming about viruses.

66
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,196
Totally irrational,
totally disoriented.

67
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,989
Doesn't know where he is,
what day of the week it is.

68
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,196
All they got was his name.

69
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,592
They figured he's stoned out of his
mind. Some kind of psychotic episode.

70
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,797
- He's been tested for drugs?
- Negative for drugs.

71
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,509
But he took on five cops
like he was dusted to the eyeballs.

72
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,070
- No drugs. You believe that?
- He's in restraints.

73
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,234
Yeah. Weren't you listenin'? I've got
two police officers in the hospital!

74
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,518
The medic gave him enough Stelazine
to kill a horse. He's rarin' to go.

75
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,354
That would explain the bruises, I guess.
The struggle.

76
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,750
Yeah. You wanna go in there,
examine him?

77
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,990
Yes, please.

78
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,629
Is this all you have?
Ran it through your system?

79
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,714
No match-up. No licence, no prints,
no warrants. Nothing.

80
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,315
- I should probably go in with you.
- No, thank you.

81
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,470
- That won't be necessary.
- All right.

82
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,030
He'll be right here,
just in case.

83
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,195
Mr Cole, my name is Kathryn Railly.
I'm a psychiatrist.

84
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,748
I work for the county.
I don't work for the police.

85
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,308
So my concern is for your well-being.
Do you understand that?

86
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,358
Need to go!
Need to go!

87
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,876
I can't make the police
let you go.

88
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,997
But I do wanna help you,
so l--

89
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,878
I need you to tell me exactly
what happened tonight.

90
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,316
Do you think
you can do that,James?

91
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,789
May I call you James?

92
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,634
James.
Nobody ever calls me that.

93
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,713
- Have you been a patient at County?
- No.

94
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,679
- Have I seen you someplace?
- Not possible.

95
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,753
I need to go! I'm supposed
to be gathering information.

96
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,991
- What kind of information?
- Won't help you.

97
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,072
Won't help anyone.
Won't change anything.

98
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,389
James, do you know
why you're here?

99
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,917
'Cause I'm a good observer.
I've got a tough mind.

100
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,595
You don't remember
assaulting a police officer?

101
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,639
Why am I chained?
Why are these chains on me?

102
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,950
You've been in an institution
before, haven't you?

103
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,077
- Or hospital?
- No! Now I need to go. Need to go!

104
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,913
- Have you been in prison,James?
- Underground.

105
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,718
Hiding?

106
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,634
I love this air.

107
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,554
Oh, it's such wonderful air.

108
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,270
- What's wonderful about the air,James?
- Very fresh. No germs.

109
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,392
Why do you think there aren't
any germs in the air?

110
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,994
- This is October, right?
- April.

111
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,834
- What year is this?
- What year do you think it is?

112
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,717
1996.

113
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,588
That's the future,James. Do you
think you're living in the future?

114
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,477
1996 is the past.

115
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,473
No, 1996 is the future.

116
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,676
This is 1990.

117
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,671
- Shut up, ladies.
- Where're you taking me?

118
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,115
South of France, buddy.
Fancy hotel. You'll love it.

119
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,760
I can't go to France. I just need
to make a telephone call.

120
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,118
Yeah, yeah. Zip it, Daisy. You fooled
the shrink, but you don't fool us.

121
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,677
Let's go, ace.

122
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,074
All right.
Come on, come on.

123
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,434
There you go.
Now, lemme see your head,Jimbo.

124
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,990
- See if you got any creepy crawlers.
- I need to make a telephone call.

125
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,834
Got to get to a doctor,Jimbo. Can't
make no calls till the doctor says.

126
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,273
It's very important!

127
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,718
What you gotta do,Jimbo,
is take it easy. Relax into things.

128
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,792
And we'll all get along fine
if you just relax.

129
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,275
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

130
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,914
Hey, Goines!

131
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,638
Yo, Goines!

132
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,676
Yo,Jeffrey!

133
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,234
- What?
- Look here.

134
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,279
This here's James. Now, do me a favour.
Why don't you show him around?

135
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,794
Tell him the TV rules.
Show him the games and stuff. Okay?

136
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,633
How much you gonna pay me?
How much? I'd be doin' your job.

137
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,280
- Five thousand dollars. That enough?
- Five thousand?

138
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,316
I'll wire a cheque
to your account as usual.

139
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,717
I'll give him the deluxe
mental hospital tour.

140
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,314
Kid around, makes 'em feel good.
We're pals.

141
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,994
You're the prisoners.
No, you're the guards.

142
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,798
Now you got it.

143
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,395
Okay, it's all in good fun.
Here's some games here.

144
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,836
And there's--
Get out! Get out!

145
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,756
He was in my chair.

146
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,389
Games. Games.
Here's some games.

147
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,710
Games that wanna get out.

148
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,360
See? More games.

149
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,876
Games, they vegetize you.
See?

150
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,350
If you play the games, you're
voluntarily taking a tranquillizer.

151
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,876
I guess they gave you
some chemical restraints. Drugs!

152
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,111
What'd they give you? Thorazine?
Haldol? How much? How much?

153
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,270
Learn your drugs. Know your dosages.
It's elementary.

154
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,830
- I need to make a telephone call.
- A telephone call?

155
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,038
That's communication with the outside
world. Doctor's discretion.

156
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,588
If all of these nuts
could just make phone calls...

157
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,399
it could spread insanity
oozing through telephone cables...

158
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,109
oozing to the ears of all these
poor, sane people, infecting them.

159
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,839
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.

160
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,471
In fact, very few,Jim--Jim, very few
of us here are actually mentally ill.

161
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,710
I'm not saying
you're not mentally ill.

162
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,713
For all I know, you're crazy as a loon.
But that's not why you're here.

163
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,038
You're here
because of the system.

164
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,877
There's the television.

165
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,996
It's all right there.
All right there.

166
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,957
Look, listen, kneel, pray.

167
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,918
The commercials!

168
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,958
We're not productive any more.
Don't make things. It's all automated.

169
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,032
What are we for then?
We're consumers,Jim.

170
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,873
Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff,
you're a good citizen.

171
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,838
But if you don't buy a lot of stuff,
what are you then?

172
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,434
What?
You're mentally ill.

173
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,559
Fact,Jim. Fact! If you don't
buy things: toilet paper, new cars...

174
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,278
electrically operated
sexual devices...

175
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,510
stereo systems
with brain-implanted headphones...

176
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,309
screwdrivers with built-in radar
devices, voice-activated computers--

177
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,277
Take it easy,Jeffrey.

178
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,635
Be calm!

179
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,795
Right. That's right.
You're a very attractive woman.

180
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,633
If you want to watch a particular
TV programme, like <i>All My Children...</i>

181
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,349
go to the nurse, tell her the day,
the time the show you wanna see is on.

182
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,590
But you have to tell her before
the show is scheduled to be on.

183
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,990
This guy was always requesting shows
that had already played.

184
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,072
Yes. No.
You have to tell her before.

185
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,755
He couldn't grasp the idea that
the nurse couldn't make it be yesterday.

186
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,035
She couldn't turn back time!
Thank you, Einstein.

187
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,112
Now he, he was nuts.
He was a fruitcake,Jim.

188
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,512
Okay, that's it,Jeffrey.
You're gonna get a shot.

189
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,239
- I warned you.
- Right.

190
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,196
I got a little carried away...

191
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,114
explaining the inner workings
of the institution to Jim.

192
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,230
I don't really come
from outer space.

193
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,914
Oh. L.J. Washington.
He doesn't really come from outer space.

194
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,309
Don't mock me, my friend.

195
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,439
Get outta my chair!

196
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,478
It's a condition
of mental divergence.

197
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,870
I find myself
on the planet Ogo.

198
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,599
Part of an intellectual elite...

199
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,993
preparing to subjugate
the barbarian hordes on Pluto.

200
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,915
But even though this is a totally
convincing reality for me in all ways...

201
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,676
nevertheless, Ogo is actually
a construct of my psyche.

202
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,116
I am mentally divergent...

203
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,113
in that I am escaping
certain unnamed realities...

204
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,589
that plague my life here.

205
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,673
When I stop going there,
I will be well.

206
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,272
Are you also divergent,
friend?

207
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,274
This is a place
for crazy people.

208
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,477
I'm not crazy.

209
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,393
We don't use that term, " crazy,''
Mr Cole.

210
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,229
You've got
some real nuts here!

211
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,913
I know some things
that you don't know.

212
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,673
It's gonna be very difficult
for you to understand it.

213
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,470
I'm not gonna hurt anyone!

214
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,835
All right.

215
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,356
Look,
have any of you heard...

216
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,228
of the Army
of the Twelve Monkeys?

217
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,036
They stencil this on the sides
of buildings everywhere.

218
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,839
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?

219
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,990
Why don't you just
take your time...

220
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,514
and try to explain this
from the beginning?

221
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,875
Right, right.
It's 1990.

222
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,635
Okay, that makes sense.
They wouldn't have been active yet.

223
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,995
Five billion people
died in 1996 and 1997.

224
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,755
Almost the entire population
of the world.

225
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,993
Only about one percent
of us survived.

226
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,914
- Are you going to save us?
- How can I? This already happened.

227
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,470
I can't save you.
Nobody can.

228
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,076
I am simply trying to gather information
to help the people in the present...

229
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,912
trace the path of the virus.

230
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,551
We're not in the present now,
Mr Cole?

231
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,394
1990 is the past. This already happened.
That's what I'm trying--

232
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,278
You believe 1996 is the present then,
is that it?

233
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,148
No! 1996 is the past too.
Listen to me. What l--

234
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,916
What l-- What I need to do
is make a telephone call.

235
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,152
I can straighten this out
if I make a telephone call.

236
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,198
Who would you call?
Who would straighten everything out?

237
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,558
The scientists. They'll want to know
that they sent me to the wrong time.

238
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,475
I can leave a voice mail message
that they monitor from the present.

239
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,110
Can I just make
one telephone call, please?

240
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,111
Please?

241
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,595
What are you doin' in the dog bowl?
Get outta there!

242
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,150
Who put those Doritos
in there anyway?

243
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,516
Yes? What?
Voice mail?

244
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,830
Look, I don't know--
Stop makin' that noise!

245
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,070
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

246
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,119
Is this a joke?
I don't know any scientists.

247
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,111
Duanne, get out--
James who?

248
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,997
Wasn't who you expected?

249
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,108
No. It was some lady.
She didn't know anything.

250
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,239
Well, maybe it was
the wrong number.

251
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,871
No. That's why they chose me.
I remember things.

252
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,110
James, where did you grow up?

253
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,156
Dr Railly.

254
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,198
I have the strangest feeling
I've met you before.

255
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,353
Wait. This is 1990. I'm supposed
to be leaving messages in 1996!

256
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
It's not the right number yet!
That's the problem!

257
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,595
<i>I have a message for them.</i>

258
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,238
Won't work.
Can't open it.

259
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,914
You think you can remove the grill,
but you can't. It's welded.

260
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,710
See? Told you.
All the doors are locked too.

261
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,109
They're protecting the people
on the outside from us...

262
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,589
when the people on the outside
are as crazy as us.

263
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,871
Do you know what " crazy'' is?
Crazy is " majority rules.'' Yeah.

264
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,837
Take germs, for example.

265
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,309
Germs?

266
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,995
In the 18th century, no such thing.
<i>Nada.</i> Nothing.

267
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,310
No one ever imagined such a thing!
No sane person, anyway.

268
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,350
Along comes this doctor.

269
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,154
Semmelweis!

270
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,312
Semmelweis comes along, trying to
convince people, other doctors mainly...

271
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,233
that there are these teeny, tiny,
invisible bad things called germs...

272
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,675
that get into your body
and make you sick.

273
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,274
He's trying to get doctors
to wash their hands.

274
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,237
What is this guy?
Crazy?

275
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,790
Teeny, tiny, invisible--
"What do you call 'em? Germs? What?''

276
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,519
Now, cut to the 20th century.

277
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,469
Last week, in fact, right before
I got dragged into this hellhole!

278
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,358
I go in to order a burger
in this fast-food joint.

279
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,158
The guy drops it on the floor.

280
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,435
Jim, he picks it up,
wipes it off.

281
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,556
He hands it to me
like it was all okay.

282
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,712
"What about the germs?'' I say.
He says, "I don't believe in germs.

283
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,759
Germs are a plot they made up so they
can sell you disinfectants and soaps.''

284
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,753
Now, he's crazy, right?
See?

285
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,276
There's no right. There's no wrong.
There's only popular opinion.

286
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,794
You, you, you believe in germs,
right?

287
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,599
I'm not crazy.

288
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,515
Of course not! You wanna escape, right?
That's very sane.

289
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,516
I can help you.
You want me to, don't ya? Get you out?

290
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,510
You know how
to get outta here?

291
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,909
Yes, my son!

292
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,390
- Then why don't ya?
- Why don't I try to escape?

293
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,075
Good question. Very good question.
Intelligent.

294
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,199
Because I would be crazy to escape.
I have sent out word.

295
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,511
- I am all taken care of.
- What does that mean?

296
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,478
I've managed to contact
certain underlings, evil spirits...

297
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,120
secretaries of secretaries
and other assorted minions...

298
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,077
who will contact my father.

299
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,993
And when my father finds out
I'm in this kind of place...

300
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,675
he'll have them transfer me
to one of those classy joints...

301
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,593
where they treat you properly,
like a person, a guest!

302
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,035
With sheets and towels
like a big hotel...

303
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,399
with great drugs for all of us
nut-case, lunatic, maniac devils!

304
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,111
Sorry. Sorry.

305
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,112
I got a little agitated.
The thought of escape crossed my mind.

306
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,509
And suddenly--

307
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,717
Suddenly I felt like bending
the fucking bars back!

308
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,590
And ripping out the window frames
and eating them! Yes, eating them!

309
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,875
And leaping, leaping, leaping!

310
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,679
Colonics for everyone!

311
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,159
I'm a mental patient.
I'm supposed to act out.

312
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,232
Wait'll you morons find out who I am!
My father's gonna be really upset.

313
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,880
And when my father gets upset,
the ground shakes.

314
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,909
My father is God!
I worship my father!

315
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,869
<i>These dramatic video tapes, secretly</i>
<i>obtained by animal rights activists...</i>

316
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,996

317
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,550
<i>But many scientists</i>

318
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,394

319
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,349
- We're all monkeys.
- They hurt you?

320
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,879
Not as bad as what they're doing
to the Easter Bunny.

321
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,349
Look at them.
They're just askin' for it.

322
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,357
Maybe the human race
deserves to be wiped out.

323
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,274
Wiping out the human race?

324
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,432
It's a great idea.
It's great.

325
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,511
But more of a long-term thing.

326
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,830
First we have to focus
on more immediate goals.

327
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,275
I didn't say a word
about you-know-what.

328
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,551
- What are you talking about?
- Your plan. Emancipation.

329
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,557
What are you writing?
You a reporter?

330
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,631
It's private.

331
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,911
A lawsuit?
You gonna sue 'em?

332
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,436
Yo,Jimbo.
Time for your meds.

338

Fetch!

339
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,752
Get it?
Monkey. Monk key.

340
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,792
What?

341
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,915
<i>If you see a bearish future</i>

Remember the plan.
I did my part!

- Yes. When.

Yes, enhance your portfolio now.

Five hundred dollars.
I got $500. I'm insured!

this was in my box!

374
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,951

it wasn't meant for me.

air you can breathe--''

378
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,228
James Cole, right?

379
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,075
"I would do anything to stay here
but I must leave. Please help me.''

380
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,674
Okay, okay, okay.
Poor man.

381
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,672
Hey, Kathryn?
James Cole is one of yours, right?

382
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,320
He eloped.
Last seen, he was up on two.

383
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,913
Shit!

384
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,149
We have to know exactly
what's there so we can fix it.

385
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,515
Doctor, we have a visitor.

386
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,036
May I help you?
Excuse me?

387
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,515
Hey,Jimbo.
What's up, man?

388
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,071
All right, it's okay.
Take it easy.

389
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,628
- It'll be all right.
- Take care.

390
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,996
Take it easy.
We'll work this out, okay?

391
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,198
Send you back to your room. A little
milk and cookies, you'll be all right.

392
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,919
Just take it easy, okay?

393
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,311
Calm down!

394
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,919
Take him down!
Take him the fuck down!

395
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,273
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
Dr Railly, help me, please.

396
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,670
- We'll give you something to calm you.
- No! No more drugs!

397
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,115
James, we have to do this.
You're very confused.

398
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,994
Kathryn, we've been working
together for four years.

399
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,389
I've never seen you
like this before.

400
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,439
So please stop being so defensive.
This isn't an inquisition.

401
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,717
I didn't think I was being defensive.
I was trying to explain exactly what--

402
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,553
He should've been in restraints.

403
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,110
It was bad judgment on your part,
plain and simple. Why not own up to it?

404
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,998
Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have
the strangest feeling about him.

405
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,470
- I've seen him before and I'm trying--
- Two policemen are in the hospital.

406
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,711
Now we've got a security guard
with a skull fracture.

407
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,951
I said it was bad judgment!
What else do you want me to say?

408
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,474
You see that?
See what I mean?

409
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,472
You're being defensive.
Isn't she being defensive?

410
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,276
We have another situation.

411
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,274
- He was fully restrained?
- Yes, sir. I did it myself.

412
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,875
And he was fully sedated?

413
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,030
He was fully sedated.

414
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,714
Are you trying to tell me a fully
sedated, fully restrained patient...

415
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,839
somehow slipped out that vent,
replaced the grill behind him...

416
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,959
and is wriggling his way
through the ventilation system?

417
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,750
Watch it!

418
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,149
You sure fucked up!

419
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,150
- Where are you?
- Ah, you can talk!

420
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,117
My name's not Bob.

421
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,159
Not a prob, Bob.
Where'd they send you?

422
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,074
- Where are you?
- Another cell.

423
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,314
Maybe.

424
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,550
What do you mean " maybe''?
What's that supposed to mean?

425
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,234
Maybe means...

426
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,198
maybe I'm in the next cell.

427
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,795
Another volunteer like you.

428
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,077
Or maybe I'm in
the Central Office...

429
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,436
spying on ya
for all those science bozos.

430
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,879
Or, hey...

431
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,111
maybe I'm not even here.

432
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,239
Maybe I'm just in your head.

433
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,597
No way to confirm anything.

434
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,793
- Where'd they send ya?
- 1990.

435
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,159
'90! How was it?
Good drugs? Lots of pussy?

436
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,789
Hey, Bob, you do the job?

437
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,031
You find out the big info?

438
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,680
Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

439
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,149
It was supposed to be 1996.

440
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,994
Science ain't an exact science
with these clowns.

441
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,640
But they're getting better.

442
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,998
You're lucky you didn't end up
in ancient Egypt.

443
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,513
Shh! They're comin'.

444
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,428
<i>The Freedom for Animals Association</i>
<i>on Second Avenue...</i>

445
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,239
<i>is the secret headquarters</i>
<i>of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.</i>

446
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,835

- Well?
- What?

450
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,632
Did you or did you not
record that message?

451
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,793
It's a reconstruction
of a deteriorated recording.

452
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,317
Weak signal. We have to put them
together one word at a time.

453
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,311
We just finished
rebuilding this.

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,915
Did you or did you not
make this call?

455
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,233
I couldn't make any call. You sent me
to the wrong year. It was 1990.

456
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,111
- You're certain of that?
- What'd you do with your time, Cole?

457
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,873
Did you waste it on drugs?
Women?

458
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,871
- They forced me to take drugs.
- Forced you?

459
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,191
Why would someone
force you to take drugs?

460
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,634
I was in trouble.
I got arrested.

461
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,473
I did what you wanted.
I got a specimen, a spider.

462
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,439
I didn't have anyplace
to put it, so I ate it.

463
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,115
But you sent me to the wrong year,
so it really doesn't matter.

464
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,078
Did you see this
when you went back?

465
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,515
No, sir, I don't think so.

466
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,990
What about these people?
Did you see any of these people?

467
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,992
No.

468
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,833
Oh, wait, wait.

469
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,917
Him?
You saw that man?

470
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,516
Maybe in the mental institution.

471
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,309
You were in a mental institution?
Oh, God.

472
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,359
Cole, you were sent back to make
some very important observations.

473
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,271
You could've made
a real contribution.

474
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,079
Helped us
to reclaim the planet.

475
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,469
As well as reducing
your sentence.

476
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,872
The question is, Cole,
do you want another chance?

477
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,950
Last connection going on.

478
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,717
No mistakes this time, Cole.

479
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,633
Stay alert.
Keep your eyes open.

480
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,315
We're thinking about the spider, Cole.
Try and do something like that again.

481
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,356
Just relax now.
Don't fight it.

482
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,398
We're sending you
to the third quarter of 1996.

483
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,789
Right on the money.

484
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,759
I don't understand!

485
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,716
What?

486
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,552
I don't understand!

487
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,917
- Where am I?
- I gotta find 'em! I gotta find 'em!

488
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,275
Help me!
I don't know where I am.

489
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,197
- You gotta help me find 'em!
-Jose?

490
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,157
-Jose!
- Cole!

491
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,834
Cole, where are we?

492
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,951
- Help me, Cole!
- Oh, God, wait!

493
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,750
<i>"In a season of great pestilence...</i>

494
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,276
<i>there are omens and divinations.</i>

495
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,396
And one of the four beasts
gave unto the seven angels...

496
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,472
seven golden vials
full of the wrath of God...

497
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,518
who liveth forever and ever.''

498
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,033
Revelations.

499
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,635
In the 14th century, according to
accounts of officials of that time...

500
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,030
this man appeared suddenly in
the village of Wyle near Stonehenge...

501
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,997
in April of 1362.

502
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,474
Using unfamiliar words
and speaking in a strange accent...

503
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,313
the man made dire prognostications
about a pestilence...

504
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,791
which he said would wipe out humanity
in approximately 600 years.

505
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,998
Obviously this plague-doomsday scenario
is considerably more compelling...

506
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,991
when reality supports it
with a virulent disease...

507
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,117
whether it's the bubonic plague,
small pox or AIDS.

508
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,270
Now we have technological horrors
as well...

509
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,954
such as chemical warfare,
which first reared its ugly head...

510
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,713
during the deadly mustard gas attacks
of World War I.

511
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,110
During such an attack in the French
trenches in October of 1917...

512
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,872
we have an account
of this soldier...

513
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,428
who, during an assault,
was wounded by shrapnel...

514
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,478
and hospitalized, apparently
in a state of hysteria.

515
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,518
Doctors found he had lost
all comprehension of French...

516
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,830
but that he spoke English fluently...

517
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,957
albeit in a regional dialect
they didn't recognize.

518
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,396
The man, though physically
unaffected by the gas...

519
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,710
was beside himself.

520
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,519
He claimed that he
had come from the future...

521
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,556
that he was looking
for a pure germ...

522
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,473
that would ultimately wipe mankind
off the face of the Earth...

523
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,393
starting in the year 1996.

524
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,193
Though injured, the young soldier
disappeared from the hospital...

525
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,840
no doubt trying to carry on
his mission to warn others...

526
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,275
and substituting
for the agony of war...

527
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,636
a self-inflicted agony
we call "the Cassandra complex."

528
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,190
Cassandra, in Greek legend,
was condemned to know the future...

529
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,078
but to be disbelieved
when she foretold it.

530
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,119
Hence, the agony of foreknowledge, plus
the impotence to do anything about it.

531
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,355
I'm going right out
to get vaccinated.

532
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,512
I think, Dr Railly,
you've given alarmists a bad name.

533
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,318
I have?

534
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,190
There's real data that the planet cannot
survive the excesses of the human race.

535
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,919
- This is true.
- Proliferation of atomic devices.

536
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,116
Uncontrolled breeding habits.

537
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,590
Pollution of land, sea and air.
The rape of the environment.

538
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,310
In this context, it's obvious Chicken
Little represents the sane vision...

539
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,995
and that <i>Homo sapiens'</i> motto,
"Let's go shopping" ...

540
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,913
is the cry of the true lunatic.

541
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,398
Please, Dr Railly. I wonder
if you're aware of my own studies.

542
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,592
See you at work tomorrow.

543
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,319
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

544
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,872
Get in the car!

545
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,793
I've got a gun. Get in the car.

546
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,119
Drive.

547
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,475
Take my purse.
I've got a lot of cash, credit cards.

548
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,120
- Take my keys.
- Start the car!

549
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,314
Here, turn right.
Turn right here.

550
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,313
- Where are we going?
- Philadelphia.

551
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,075
- That's more than a hundred miles.
- That's why I can't walk there.

552
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,628
-Just let me go.
-Just drive!

553
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,029
- You can take the car.
- I don't know how to drive.

554
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,229
I went underground when I was eight.
I told you that before.

555
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,719
At the next--

556
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,430
- At the next corner, turn right.
- Cole.James Cole.

557
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,069
You escaped from a locked room
six years ago.

558
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,993
Six years for you.
Come on.

559
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,718
Turn around! Get goin'.

560
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,635
I can't believe that this
is a coincidence, Mr Cole.

561
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,678
- Have you been following me?
- You said you would help me.

562
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,911
I know this isn't what you meant,
but...

563
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,991
I don't have any money.

564
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,709
I hurt my leg.
I've been sleeping on the street.

565
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,358
I'm sure I smell bad.

566
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,318
Do you have any food in this car?

567
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,995
- You have been following me?
- No.

568
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,719
No, I saw this...

569
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,833
in a store window.

570
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,718
I can read, remember?

571
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,356
Why do you want to go
to Philadelphia?

572
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,558
I checked out the Baltimore information.
It was nothing.

573
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,315
It's in Philadelphia.
That's where the ones who did it are.

574
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,233
The Twelve Monkeys.

575
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,790
Is that a radio?
Can you turn it on?

576
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,031
<i>This is a personal message to you.</i>

577

<i>Are you at the end of your rope?</i>

578
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,794
<i>Are you dying to get away?</i>

579
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,395
<i>The Florida Keys are waiting for you.</i>
<i>Ocean waves--</i>

580
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,596
I've never seen the ocean.

581
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,195
It's an advertisement, Mr Cole.

582
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,919
What?

583
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,673
It's an advertisement.
You understand that, don't you?

584
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,514
It's not really
a special message to you.

585
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,438
Mr Cole.

586
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,673
- You used to call me James.
- You prefer that?

587
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,631
James, you don't really
have a gun--

588
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,757
Can you turn this up?
Can you make this louder?

589
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,912
<i>I found my thrill</i>

<i>When I found you</i>

592
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,398
I love the music

593
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,109
I love this air.
Love to breathe this air!

594
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,194
<i>WXBX news break.</i>

595

<i>News as it happens.</i>
<i>Roger Pratt reporting.</i>

596
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,870
<i>A story breaking now is emergency crews</i>
<i>are converging on a corn field...</i>

<i>he disappeared before their eyes.</i>

599

<i>Young Neuman apparently stepped</i>

<i>playmates heard him cry out faintly.</i>

602

- Never cry wolf.
- What?

603
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,517
My father said that to me.
He said, "Never cry wolf."

604
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,309
Then people won't believe you
if something really happens.

605
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,154
If something really happens
like what,James?

606
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,151
Something bad.

607
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,390
Can we have some more music, please?
I don't wanna hear this stuff.

608
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,233
Can we hear more music?

609
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,917
<i>- I see trees of green</i>
- Oh, that's good. That's good.

610
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:51,192
<i>I've seen them bloom</i>

611
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,316
<i>For me and you</i>

612
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,757
<i>And I think to myself</i>

613
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,276
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

614
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,310
<i>Hello, Dr Railly?</i>
<i>This is Wikke from Psych Admitting.</i>

<i>Do you rememberJames Cole?</i>

616
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,278
<i>The paranoid who pulled</i>
<i>the Houdini back in '90?</i>

617
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,396
<i>Well, he's back, and he's--</i>

618
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,711
<i>Sorry about that. He's looking for you.</i>
<i>I thought you oughta know.</i>

619
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,313
<i>Take care.</i>

620
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,790
It's just like I told you.
Me and my husband went ahead.

621
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,793
I don't know. She never showed.
That is totally unlike her.

622
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,792
Do you happen to know
the make of her car?

623
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,030
Cherokee. '94 Cherokee.

624
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,350
<i>Silver.</i>

625
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,598
<i>I have done " doed" it,</i> ja.

626
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,593
<i>I, Professor Grossenfibber,</i>

628
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,999
<i>Oh, excuse me, mister.</i>
<i>Have a cigar.</i>

629
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,000
<i>Excuse me, mister.</i>
<i>Have a cigar.</i>

630
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,277
<i>Now my time machine</i>
<i>is ready for experiments.</i>

631
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,520
<i>Ah, the woodpecker!</i>

632
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,160
<i>Yoo-hoo, woodpecker!</i>

633
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,633
You were in my dream just now.

634
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,397
Hair is different.
Different colour.

635
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,789
I'm sure it was you.

636
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,120
What was the dream about?

637
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,719
About an airport...

638
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,155
before everything happened.

639
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,600
It's the same dream
I always have.

640
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,513
When I was a kid.

641
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,511
And I was in it?

642
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,909
What did I do?

643
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,394
You were very upset.

644
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,713
You're always very upset
in the dream.

645
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,711
Just never knew it was you.

646
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,836
It wasn't me before,James.

647
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,515
It's become me now
because of what's happening.

648
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,914
Could you please untie me?

649
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,797
No, I think it was always you.

650
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,474
Very strange.

651
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,710
You're flushed
and you were moaning.

652
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,190
I think you're running a fever.

653
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,430
What are you doing?

654
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,917
<i>In Fresno, California, crews continue</i>
<i>to attempt to rescue Ricky Neuman.</i>

655

I love this music.

663
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,714
We don't have this.
We don't have anything like this.

664
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,109
What are all those?

665
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,474
These?

666
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,313
My notes, clues.

667
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,311
What kind of clues?

668
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,311
It's about the secret army.

669
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,516
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
They're the ones that spread the virus.

670
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,512
That's why I'm here.
I have to find them. That's my mission.

671
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,512
Have to locate them because they
have the virus in its pure form...

672
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,192
before it mutates.

673
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,033
When I locate them,
they'll send a scientist back here.

674
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,076
That scientist will study the virus.

675
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,039
When he goes back to the present,
he and the scientists will make a cure.

676
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,270
<i>Police officers</i>

Does that disturb you?

681
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,109
No. Thought it was about us.

682
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,954
Thought maybe they'd captured us
and arrested me.

683
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,234
Just a joke.

684
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,316
I remember being very afraid
for that little boy.

685
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,197
All alone, down that well...

686
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,316
not knowing if anybody's
gonna get him out.

687
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,836
First time I was really afraid
when I was a kid.

688
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,831
What do you mean,
"when you were a kid" ?

689
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,559
Never mind.
Just a prank, a hoax.

690
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,631
That boy's hiding in a barn.

691
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,438
"There are omens and divinations.

695
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,312
You won't think I'm crazy
when people start dying next month.

696
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,798
First they'll think
it's just some weird fever.

697
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,195
Then they'll find out.

698
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,033
They'll catch on.

699
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,113
Wait. Stop here! Stop the car!
Stop right here!

700
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,192
I was right. They're here!

701
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,716
You see? Twelve Monkeys!
Twelve Monkeys!

702
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,917
You believe me now?
Come on!

703
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,630
Come on!

704
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,915
They're here, you see?

705
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,309
Twelve Monkeys!

706
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,356
Twelve Monkeys. Come on!

707
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,197
Twelve Monkeys.

708
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,714
Wait, wait. Wait, here.

709
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,109
Here, do you see it?
Do you see?

710
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,589
I see some red paint,
some marks.

711
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,399
- Marks? You think that--
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

712
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,709
Don't--
Don't you do anything crazy.

713
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,518
Or I'll hurt somebody.

714
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,717
I am not gonna do anything crazy, but
none of this is what you think it is!

715
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,234
You can't hide from them, Bob.

716
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,790
I said, you can't hide from them.

717
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,510
No, sir, ol' Bob.

718
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,319
Don't even try.

719
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,793
They hear everything.

720
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,111
They got that tracking device on ya.

721
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,871
They can find you anywhere,
anytime!

722
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,394
It's in the tooth.

723
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,914
Right, Bob?

724
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,514
But I fooled 'em, old buddy.

725
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,195
They don't have to spy on me.
I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

726
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,078
You see? Here it is again. See?

727
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,118
Here, follow this paint trail.

728
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,316
Here. It's here, see?

729
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,312
I am not going--

730
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,718
Come with me!
The paint trail goes here.

731
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,150
Let go of my arm!
James, we shouldn't be here.

732
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,151
Goddam it!

733
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,708
Leave me alone!

734
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,429
Let's get out of here.
James, we shouldn't be here.

735
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,359
Please don't kill me.
Don't kill me, please!

736
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,352
Don't kill me, don't kill me!

737
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,992
Stick around, bitch.

738
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,994
Are you all right?

739
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,557
Is he alive?

740
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,518
Go ahead.
We're runnin' out of time.

741
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,511
- You can't help him.
- Oh,Jesus!

742
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,113
James, you killed him!

743
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,919
All I see are dead people.
Come on.

744
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,798
- Come on.
- You never had a gun before!

745
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,633
I have one now.
Come on. Come on!

746

He's disturbed. He's dangerous.

01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,031
- I told you that Goines would get us--
- Shut up!

764
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,517
- Goines?
-Jeffrey Goines?

765
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,910
Jeffrey becomes this big star,
and the media latch onto him...

766
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,991
because he's picketing
his own father...

767
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,071
a famous
Nobel-prize-winning virologist.

768
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,390
You must have seen all that on TV.

769
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,119
I don't watch TV.

770
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,474
Is this him?

771
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,949
Yeah, that's him, that's him.

772
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,191
What are you gonna do to us?

773
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,193
Tell me more about Jeffrey.

774
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,314
Jeffrey started getting bored
with the shit we do--

775
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,914
picketing, leafleting,
letter-writing stuff.

776
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,719
He said we were ineffectual,
liberal jerk-offs.

777
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:48,476
He wanted to do guerrilla actions
in order to educate the public.

778
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,552
- Like this?
- He let 100 snakes loose in the Senate.

779
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,190
But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
It's counterproductive. We told him.

780
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,477
So he and 11 guys,
they split off...

781
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,630
and formed this underground army.

782
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,231
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
See?

783
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,715
They started planning
a"human hunt."

784
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,995
They bought stun guns,
nets and bear traps.

785
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,389
They were gonna go to Wall Street
and trap lawyers and bankers.

786
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,914
They didn't do it, of course.
They didn't do any of it.

787
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,515
Like always, Mr Big Shot
sold his friends out.

788
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,795
What does that mean?

789
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,678
He goes on TV and gives this big
news conference, tells the world...

790
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,638
he just realized his dad's experiments
are vital for humanity...

791
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,473
and that the use of animals
is absolutely necessary...

792
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:37,315
that from now on, he,Jeffrey Goines,
will personally supervise the labs...

793
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,153
to make sure all the little animals
aren't going to suffer.

794
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,872
What is this?

795
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,036
People like that aren't accessible.
You can't just barge in on them.

796
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,839
- It's not how the world works.
- Be quiet and drive the car.

797
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,831
- I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't.

798
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,435
This car is stolen,
and we are in big trouble.

799
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,431
Big trouble.

800
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,876
If you don't turn yourself over to
the police, they're going to kill you.

801
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,190
They're going to shoot me, too,
because I'm an accessory to murder.

802
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,319
- You're all going to die.
- Nobody is going to die.

803
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,515
You're not going to save the world,
okay? You're delusional.

804
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,512
You've made all this up
out of bits and pieces in your head.

805
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,795
- No.
- Yes!

806
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,791
Let me give you an example.

807
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,190
You know Jeffrey Goines. You were
both patients at County Hospital.

808
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,398
Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake.

809
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,473
He told you that his father was a famous
scientist who worked with viruses...

810
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,393
so you incorporated that information
to this cockeyed fantasy.

811
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,914
He didn't say his father was
a scientist. He said his father was God.

812
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,513
This is insane.

813
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,717
<i>Prominent psychiatrist and author</i>
<i>Dr Kathryn Railly has been abducted...</i>

814
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,792
<i>by a dangerous mental patient,</i>
<i>James Cole.</i>

815
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,677
<i>Cole was under Railly's care</i>
<i>six years ago...</i>

816
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,832
<i>when he made</i>
<i>a dramatic escape--</i>

817
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,552
- What is the matter with your leg?
- I got shot.

818
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,914
Shot?

819
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,353
Who shot you?

820
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,154
I don't know.
It was some kind of war. Never mind.

821
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,515
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

822
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,272
What are you doing?

823
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,278
-We don't need gas.
-I thought you didn't know how to drive.

824
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,113
I said I was too young to drive.
I didn't say I was stupid.

825
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,677
This can't go on.

826
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,638
If you have a bullet in your leg,
I have to take care of it.

827
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,632
I'm a doctor.
I need some supplies.

828
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,717
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>in Fresno, California...</i>

829
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,109
<i>where mining engineers</i>
<i>continue their attempt...</i>

830
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,115
<i>to sink a shaft parallel to the one</i>

831
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,668
<i>authorities say there is still a chance</i>
<i>the boy might be alive.</i>

832
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,719
You shouldn't put your weight on it.
You need stitches and antibiotics.

833
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,112
Lucky for you,
it's near the surface.

834
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,314
I love seeing the sun.

835
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,914
Wait.

836
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,514
Let me help you.

837
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,069
You smell so good.

838
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,719
You have to give yourself up.

839
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,799
You know that?

840
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,115
What are you doing? James?

841
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,839
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

842
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,680
- Stop it! What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

843
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,830
Let go of me!

844
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,351
- They find him?
- Who?

845
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,874
- That kid, the one in the pipe.
- You believe that?

846
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,951
They're lowering a monkey
down there...

847
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,110
with an infrared camera
strapped on him...

848
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,919
and a roast beef sandwich
wrapped up in tin foil.

849
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,991
- You're makin' it up.
- I shit you not, man.

850
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,993
- Life is really weird.
- A monkey and a roast beef sandwich.

851
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,272
Would that I could enjoy
this opulent dinner...

852
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:52,512
and this most stimulating
and exciting company...

853
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,559
for itself,
with no sense of purpose.

854
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,110
But, alas, I am burdened.

855
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,275
For with all this excess of public
attention and cacophony of praise...

856
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:09,399
there comes great responsibility.

857
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:13,519
I don't have to tell you all
that the dangers of science...

858
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,114
are a timeworn threat.

859
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,634
From Prometheus stealing fire
from the gods--

860
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,315
What friend?
I'm not expecting anyone.

861
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,039
But never before--

862
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,190
This is ridiculous.

863
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,590
My father's giving
a major address.

864
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,830
...to fear the power...

865
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,076
we have at hand.

866
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,550
Normally, if we caught a guy...

867
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,631
sneaking around with no ID,
we'd bust his ass.

868
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,995
Excuse my French.

869
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,991
This one says he knows you.

870
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,311
Since you seem to have had
a few unusual associates...

871
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,472
we certainly would not want
to arrest one of your closest pals.

872
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,951
Never seen him before
in my life.

873
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,600
Feel free to torture this man,
or whatever it is you do.

874
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,877
I'm going back to listen to my father's
eloquent discourse on the perils of--

875
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,032
I'm here about some monkeys.

876
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,873
- Monkeys?
- Monkeys, yes.

877
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,758
Twelve of them.

878
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,432
Arnold.

879
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,670
- You look like shit.
- You know this man?

880
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,639
Of course I know this man.
Arnold Pettibone.

881
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,792
Gee, Arnie, it's black tie.
I said, "Drop by."

882
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,634
But it's Dad's big do--
VIPs, senators, secret service.

883
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,518
You hungry, Arnie?

884
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,591
Real killer feast we're putting on.

885
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,148
Lots of dead lamb, dead cow,
dead pig.

886
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:53,037
Shall we?

887
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,315
Hi. How are you? Hello.

888
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,631
Very attractive.
"The Great Escape," 1990.

889
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,632
Watch it! Huh?
County Hospital? Am I right?

890
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,314
I can't do anything
about what you're going to do.

891
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,312
I can't change anything.
I won't stop you. I can't stop you.

892
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,039
- I just want the information.
- Come on.

893
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,510
Hi, ladies. So nice to see you again.
Watch your step on the way down.

894
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,478
All right. Who blabbed?
Bruhns? Weller?

895
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,471
I just want access
to the pure virus.

896
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,757
- Virus?
- I need to know where and what it is.

897
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,515
I get it. I see what you're up to.
It's your old plan, isn't it?

898
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,511
- What plan?
- Your plan.

899
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,909
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yes, you do.

900
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,991
We were in the day room
watching television...

901
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,719
and you were upset about the desecration
of the planet, which I understand.

902
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,712
Then you said, "Wouldn't it be great
to have a germ or virus...

903
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,473
that would wipe out mankind
and leave the animals and trees?''

904
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,710
- You're trying to confuse me.
- You were so funny.

905
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,916
I told you my father
was this famous virologist.

906
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,118
You said, "He could make a germ,
and we could steal it."

907
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,998
- You were so funny.
- They mutate! We live underground!

908
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,469
The world belongs
to the dogs and cats.

909
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,553
We live like worms.
I just need the information!

910
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,076
-Take it easy.
-You are a nutcase, completely deranged!

911
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:06,517
Delusional, paranoid.
Your process is all fucked up.

912
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,239
Your information tray
is jammed, man.

913
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,515
Do you know what it is,
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

914
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,319
It's a collection of space-case
do-gooders saving rain forests.

915
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,516
I have nothing to do
with those bozos any more.

916
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,798
I've quit being the rich-kid fall guy
for a bunch of ineffective fanatics!

917
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,474
So much for your grand plot,
asshole!

918
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,710
My father has warned people
about the dangers...

919
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,916
of experimenting with DNA viruses
for years.

920
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,436
You processed that information through
your addled, paranoid infrastructure.

921
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,954
Lo and behold,
a non-profit organization...

922
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,759
becomes a sinister,
revolutionary cabal!

923
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,876
This man is complete bat shit!

924
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,518
Ladies and gentlemen...

925
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,717
do you realize where he thinks
he comes from?

926
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,918
<i>Captain Dan Miller, the man</i>
<i>in charge of the rescue operation...</i>

927
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,036

If you ask me, the monkey's gonna eat
that goddam sandwich himself.

930
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,519
Did a man just come
running through here?

931
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,513
<i>His primary responsibility</i>
<i>was to the missing boy.</i>

932
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,670
<i>Police say</i>

come through here?

937

<i>The body was discovered</i>

939
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,516
<i>a woman in her late 20s</i>
<i>or early 30s...</i>

940
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,477

941
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,597
<i>Earlier in the day, police located</i>

942
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,240
<i>It was found not far from--</i>

943
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,308
Any sign of him?

944
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,799
Nothing.

945
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,789
He can't just disappear.

946
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,436
You bastard!

947
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,713
I could have died in there,
you son of a bitch!

948
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,030
What are you thinking of...

949
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,918
you twisted sack of shit?

950
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,717
Sorry I locked you in the trunk.

951
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,109
I'm sick of you.

952
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,997
What have you done?
Did you kill somebody?

953
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,593
Yes.

954
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,911
- A million people, five billion people.
- What?

955
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,915
Jeffrey Goines said that it
was my idea about the virus.

956
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,028
We were in the institution.
It was all so fuzzy with the drugs.

957
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,111
Do you think it was my idea?

958
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,873
Do you think maybe
I wiped out the human race?

959
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,872
Nobody is gonna wipe out
the human race.

960
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,872
Not you or Jeffrey
or anybody else.

961
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,111
You've created something
in your mind.

962
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,873
- Mentally divergent?
- Whatever.

963
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,316
A substitute reality...

964
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,915
because you don't want
to deal with anything.

965
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,390
I would love it
if that was true.

966
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,119
It can be dealt with,
but only if you want to.

967
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,509
I can help you.

968
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,716
- They're after me.
- Who is after you?

969
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,713
We have to get out of here.
There were policemen at that party.

970
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,719
Party? You went to a--

971
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,518
Never mind.

972
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,512
It's important you surrender instead
of them catching you running away.

973
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,512
Wouldn't it be great if I was crazy?
Then the world would be okay.

974
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,511
- Give me the gun. Where is the gun?
- I lost the gun.

975
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,716
I could live right here.

976
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,110
You got water, air, stars.

977
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,316
- I'm gonna attract their attention.
- Debris.

978
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,312
I'm gonna attract their attention
so they know where we are.

979
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,438
I love this world!

980
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,829
They're gonna tell you to put your hands
on your head. Do what they say.

981
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,876
I love the frogs, the spiders.

982
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,473
I'll be with you.

983
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,518
I'll help you. I won't let them--

984
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,832
Then I said something about cooperating,
and he said he would do that.

985
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,230
So I got in the car.

986
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,312
Thanks. And when l--

987
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,518
I started honking the horn,
and when I got out, he was gone.

988
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,795
I tell you something.
You lucked out.

989
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,678
For a while we thought you were a body
found down state, mutilated.

990
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,116
- He wouldn't do that.
- This the man he attacked?

991
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,275
I want to be clear
about this, okay?

992
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,635
This man and the other one
were severely beating us.

993
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,508
James Cole didn't start it.
In fact, he saved me.

994
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:51,919
Funny thing, Doctor.

995
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,278
Maybe you can help explain it to me,
you being a psychiatrist and all.

996
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:01,309
Why do kidnap victims always tell us
about the guys that grabbed 'em...

997
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,312
and they try
to make us understand...

998
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,312
how kind these bastards really were.

999
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,517
It's a normal reaction
to a life-threatening situation.

1000
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,709
He's sick, okay?

1001
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,314
He thinks he comes
from the future.

1002
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,278
He lives in a meticulously constructed
fantasy world that's disintegrating.

1003
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,669
He needs help.

1004

Well done. Well done.

During your interview,
while you were under the influence...

1033
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,399
you told us you liked music.

- This is a hospital.

- Until you recover your equilibrium.
- You're still a little disoriented.

- Time travel is a very stressful thing.
- You stood up very well, considering.

You connected the Twelve Monkeys

You know, you people don't exist.
You're not real.

used the word " prank" ...

he said the boy

Kathryn, Kathryn,
he kidnapped you.

01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,748
You saw him murder somebody...

a real possibility...

1056
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,315
he could kill you too.

For God's sake, Owen,
listen to me.

01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,037
He knew about the boy in Fresno...

1060
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,190
and he says five billion people
are gonna die.

1061
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:50,748
No way he could possibly know that.

1062
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,472
You're a rational person.
You're a trained psychiatrist.

1063
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,472
You know the difference
between what's real and what's not.

01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,438
What we say is the truth
is what everybody accepts, right?

1065
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,829
Psychiatry is the latest religion.

1066
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,469
We decide what's right and wrong.
We decide who's crazy or not.

1067
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,836
I'm in trouble here.

1068
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,639
I'm losing my faith.

1069
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,913
<i>You sure fucked up, Bob.</i>

1070
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,911
<i>But I can understand.</i>

1071
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,878
<i>You don't want your mistakes</i>
<i>pointed out to you.</i>

1072
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,520
<i>I can relate to that, old Bob.</i>

1073
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,391
<i>I know what you're thinkin'.</i>

1074
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,598
<i>You're thinkin'I don't exist</i>
<i>except in your head.</i>

1075
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,591
<i>I can see that point of view.</i>

1076
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,389
<i>But you could still talk to me,</i>
<i>couldn't ya?</i>

1077
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,277
I saw you...

1078
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,796
in 1996, in the real world.

1079
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,714
- You pulled out your teeth.
<i>- Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?</i>

1080
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,791
<i>That's a no-no.</i>

1081
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,872
<i>And when did you say you saw me?</i>

1082
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,633
<i>- In 1872?</i>
- Leave me alone!

1083
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,156
<i>Yellin' won't get you</i>
<i>what you want.</i>

1084
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,869
<i>You have to be smart</i>
<i>to get what you want.</i>

1085
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:11,113
- What do I want?
<i>- You don't know what you want?</i>

1086
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,033
<i>Sure you do, Bob.</i>

1087
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,270
<i>You know what you want.</i>

1088
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,318
You tell me.
Tell me what I want.

1089
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:23,712
<i>To see the sky and the ocean...</i>

1090
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,314
<i>to be topside...</i>

1091
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,789
<i>breathe the air...</i>

1092
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,111
<i>to be with her.</i>

1093
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,509
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

1094
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,637
<i>Isn't that what you want?</i>

1095
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,472
<i>Bob?</i>

1096
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,197
Jim Halperin, Philly PD.
Sorry to call you so early.

1097
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:03,670
You found him? Is he okay?

1098
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,955
No, no.
Au contraire, Doctor.

1099
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,951
No sign of your good friend,
the kidnapper.

1100
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,235
However, the plot does thicken.

1101
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,515
I got a ballistics report here
on my desk.

1102
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,034
It says the bullet you claim
you removed from Cole's thigh...

1103
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,997
is, in fact, an antique.

1104
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,877
<i>And all indications are...</i>

1105
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,509
<i>it was fired sometime</i>
<i>prior to the 1920s.</i>

1106
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,716
- <i>How about I take a spin down there?</i>
- This can't be.

1107
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,711
<i>You and I can grab a bite to eat...</i>

1108
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,030
and maybe you could revise
or amplify your statement.

1109
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:07,432
<i>You can't trick us, you know.</i>
<i>It wouldn't work.</i>

1110
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,794
No, sir.

1111
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,917
<i>You haven't become addicted,</i>
<i>have you...</i>

1112
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,752
<i>to that dying world?</i>

1113
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,115
No, sir.

1114
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,475
I just want to do my part
to get us back on top...

1115
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,551
in charge of the planet.

1116
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:25,110
And I have the experience.
I know the people involved.

1117
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,111
He really is the most qualified.

1118
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,156
But all that behaviour.

1119
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,754
You said we weren't real.

1120
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,432
I don't think the human mind
is meant to exist...

1121
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,351
in two different...

1122
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,796
whatever you called it,
dimensions?

1123
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,917
It's just too stressful.
You said that yourself.

1124
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,514
It's very confusing. You don't know
what's real and what's not.

1125
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,592
<i>But you know what's real now.</i>

1126
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,352
Yes, sir, I do.

1127
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,950
No, I don't know anything about...

1128
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,508
a monkey army, Doctor.

1129
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,239
No, nothing whatsoever.

1130
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,472
Good Lord, if my son was ever
involved in something like that--

1131
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:10,394
Yeah? Well, I'm sorry.

1132
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:14,473
I think it's doubly inappropriate
to discuss...

1133
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,633
security matters with you,
Dr Railly.

1134
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,030
But if it will ease your mind...

1135
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,475
rest assured that neither my son...

1136
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,755
nor any other unauthorized person...

1137
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:31,675
has access to potentially
dangerous organisms in my laboratory.

1138
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,799
Is that clear to you now?
Thank you so much for your concern.

1139
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,914
Women psychiatrists!

1140
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,432
I attended a lecture
of hers once.

1141
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,990
" Apocalyptic Visions."

1142
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,072
She was suddenly struck...

1143
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:58,994
by the most preposterous notion
about Jeffrey.

1144
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:03,712
Has she succumbed to her own...

1145
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,634
"theoretical" Cassandra disease?

1146
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,998
Maybe we ought to review
our security procedures.

1147
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:17,473
Perhaps upgrade 'em,
you know?

1148
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,471
Beef'em up.

1149
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,629
Let's consider again
our current information.

1150
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,712
If the symptoms were
first detected in Philadelphia...

1151
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,349
on December 27, 1996,
that makes us know that--

1152
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,830
It was released in Philadelphia
probably on December 13, 1996.

1153
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,674
And was seen sequentially
after that in--

1154
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,591
San Francisco, New Orleans...

1155
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:45,069
Rio de Janeiro...

1156
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,674
Rome, Kinshasa...

1157
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,716
Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.

1158
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,031
That was very well done.

1159
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,755
If you're in there,
I have to talk to you!

1160
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,909
It's the kidnap woman. The one
who was with the guy who tied us up.

1161
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,434
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the light!

1162
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,353
- What's she doin'?
- She's drawing attention to us.

1163
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:23,036
I don't know what you're up to,
but you're gonna get us in deep shit.

1164
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,157
Walkies ready,
batteries charged?

1165
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,630
I saw you!
I saw somebody in there!

1166
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,679
Secret experiments.
That's what they do.

1167
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,389
Secret, weird stuff.

1168
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,119
- Not just on animals.
- I know you.

1169
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,590
- Do 'em on people too down at--
- Have you seen James Cole?

1170
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,750
They're watching you.

1171
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,910
- Takin' pictures.
- The police.

1172
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,911
I know. Look.

1173
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,271
I have to contact James.

1174
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:58,035
It's very, very important that
he's really careful when he reaches me.

1175
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,712
Do you understand that?

1176
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,711
- Good.
- Who's James?

1177
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,634
He was with me.
He spoke to you several weeks ago.

1178
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,599
He said that you were from the future
and that you were watching him.

1179
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,631
Bolt cutters.
Did you get the bolt cutters?

1180
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,631
One dozen. They're in the van.

1181
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:26,191
- The plans for the security system?
- All right here, committed to memory.

1182
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,238
- You know what she's doin' out there?
- What's it say?

1183
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,673
I can't see it.

1184
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,991
Forget about my psychiatrist
and concentrate on the task at hand.

1185
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,677
Your psychiatrist?

1186
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,117
- Did you just say your psychiatrist?
- Ex-psychiatrist.

1187
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,952
This woman was your psychiatrist...

1188
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,110
and now she's spray-painting
our building?

1189
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,551
What's it say?

1190
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,750
- What?
- There's a policeman over there.

1191
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,956
- Pretend you don't know me.
- I want to turn myself in.

1192
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:15,350
- Where is he?
-James! Down!

1193
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,398
No, it's okay.
I'm not crazy any more.

1194
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:22,109
I mean, I am. I'm mentally divergent.
I know that now.

1195
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,397
I want you to help me.
I want to get better.

1196
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,997
Let's get outta here.

1197
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,877
He's going. Go!

1198
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,559
- I've seen that before.
- No, you haven't.

1199
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,119
A guy in a Ford is chasing her
and some other guy I can't see.

1200
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,317
No problem. It's probably
just another kidnapping...

1201
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,391
featuring Jeffrey's shrink.

1202
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,517
Pardon me.
Make that ex-shrink.

1203
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,388
This is your leader?
A certifiable lunatic...

1204
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,391
who told his former psychiatrist
all his plans...

1205
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,755
for God knows what
wacko irresponsible schemes?

1206
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,751
God knows what she's written
on that wall!

1207
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,832
Who cares what psychiatrists
write on walls?

1208
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,434
You think I told her about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys?

1209
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,671
Impossible! Do you know why?
Do you know why?

1210
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,115
Because,
you pathetically ineffectual...

1211
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:26,749
and pusillanimous pretend friend
to animals, I'll tell you why.

1212
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:29,149
Because when I had anything
to do with her six years ago...

1213
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,390
there was no such thing,
I hadn't thought of it yet.

1214
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,550
Then how come she knows
what's going on?

1215
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:36,598
Well, here's my theory on that.

1216
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:39,478
When I was institutionalized,
my brain was studied exhaustively...

1217
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,278
in the guise of mental health.

1218
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,557
I was interrogated, x-rayed.
I was examined thoroughly.

1219
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,794
Then they took everything about me
and put it into a computer...

1220
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,314
where they created
this model of my mind.

1221
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,391
Yes! Using that model...

1222
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,789
they managed to generate
every thought...

1223
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,950
I could possibly have
in the next ten years...

1224
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:01,555
which they then filtered through
a probability matrix of some kind...

1225
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:05,474
to determine everything
I was gonna do in that period.

1226
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,437
So, you see...

1227
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,511
she knew I was gonna lead
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

1228
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,592
into the pages of history
before it even occurred to me.

1229
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,990
She knows everything I'm ever gonna do
before I know it myself.

1230
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,991
How's that?

1231
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,594
Kweskin, you finish here.
I'll meet you there.

1232
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:26,434
And if you forget one thing, I'll have
you shaved, sterilized and destroyed.

1233
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,999
-Jeff?
- What?

1234
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,548
You're a great man.

1235
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,551
Fuck the bozos!

1236
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,472
He's seriously crazy.
You know that.

1237
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,312
There. Over there.

1238
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,311
Okay. Come on.

1239
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,470
- I need a room.
- Thirty-five bucks an hour.

1240
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:28,552
- An hour?
- You want quarter hours?

1241
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,278
Go someplace else.

1242
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,672
Here's...

1243
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,638
twenty-five, six, seven
for an hour.

1244
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,438
Deal?

1245
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,953
One hour, honey babe.
Number 64.

1246
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,838
Sixth floor.
Up the stairs, end of the hall.

1247
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,593
Elevator's busted.

1248
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,272
She's not "honey babe."

1249
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,830
She's a doctor.
My psychiatrist.

1250
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,592
Understand?

1251
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:10,313
Whatever gets it up for you,Jack.

1252
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,279
Tommy, this is Charlie
over at the Globe.

1253
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,391
You know if Wallace
has a new girl?

1254
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,712
Sort of a rookie type?
A little weird? Does fantasy acts?

1255
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,395
Okay, you were standing there
looking up at the moon.

1256
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,438
You were splashing through the water,
and then what?

1257
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,156
I thought I was in prison again.

1258
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,515
Just like that,
you were in prison?

1259
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,068
No, not really.

1260
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,754
Like you said,
it was all in my mind.

1261
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,998
You disappeared.

1262
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,197
One minute you were there,
the next minute you were gone.

1263
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,475
Did you run through the woods, or--

1264
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:59,473
I don't know.
I don't remember.

1265
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:04,276
The boy in the well.
How did you know that was just a hoax?

1266
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,596
It was?
I didn't know.

1267
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,318
You said he was hiding
in a barn!

1268
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,391
I think I maybe saw a TV show
about that...

1269
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,596
when I was a kid where a boy--

1270
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,750
It wasn't a TV show!
It was real!

1271
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,832
Maybe this boy saw
the same TV show that I did...

1272
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,751
and he copied it.

1273
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,515
Look, you were right.
I am mentally ill.

1274
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,795
I imagined all these things,
these people.

1275
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,348
I know they're not real.

1276
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,908
I can trick them.

1277
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,275
I can make them do what I want.
I worked on 'em a little bit.

1278
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,476
I got back here to get better.

1279
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:41,997
- I can stay here.
- What does this mean to you?

1280
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:53,076
I think I had a dream
about this.

1281
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:58,474
You had a bullet from World War I
in your leg. How did it get there?

1282
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,189
I don't know. You said I had delusions,
that I created this world.

1283
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,511
- You said you could explain.
- I can't!

1284
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,717
I'm trying to, and--

1285
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,315
I can't believe that everything
we say or do has already happened.

1286
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,396
We can't change
what's gonna happen.

1287
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:19,189
And if five billion people
are gonna die, it's--

1288
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,396
I want the future to be unknown.

1289
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,671
I want to become
a whole person again.

1290
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,111
I want this to be the present.

1291
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:35,519
I want to stay here this time...

1292
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,828
with you.

1293
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:09,150
Do you remember six years ago
you had a phone number?

1294
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,754
- It was the wrong number then.
- A woman answered.

1295
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,799
It was the wrong number in 1990.
It should be the right number now.

1296
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:18,075
Do you remember it?

1297
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,229
The number.

1298
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:28,159
This is my territory, bitch!

1299
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,637
- Is this real or one of my delusions?
- This is definitely real.

1300
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:39,352
Excuse me. I think we've got
a little misunderstanding here.

1301
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,318
- Yeah. We--
- Gee, really?

1302
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,278
Now, you just sit tight, chief.

1303
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,352
You listen to me,
little Miss Understanding.

1304
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,591
You think you can go around me and
peddle your ass in this part of town?

1305
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,796
You bet your life we got
what I would call...

1306
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,950
a major fuckin' misunderstanding.

1307
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,111
James, no! Don't!

1308
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,911
Put him in the closet.
Take his money first!

1309
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,753
- You want me to rob him?
- We need cash!

1310
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,071
Call the cops!
Call the cops!

1311
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,799
What's goin' on?

1312
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,155
I've got friends, man.

1313
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,515
Don't fuckin' kill me.

1314
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,955
No,James!

1315
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,552
Open the door!

1316
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,234
What the fuck are you doing?

1317
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,278
Please don't hurt him.
Open the door.

1318
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,271
James, come on.

1319
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,431
Just in case--

1320
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:48,354
Just in case I'm not crazy,
this is how they find us.

1321
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,273
By our teeth.

1322
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,920
I don't want them to find me ever.

1323
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,273
I don't want to go back.

1324
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,677
Step back.
You'd better load.

1325
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,671
Police! Throw your weapons out
and come on out!

1326
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,551
Hey! Is that the cops?

1327
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:23,358
I'm the innocent victim here.

1328
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,034
I was attacked
by a coked-up whore...

1329
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,032
and a fuckin' crazy dentist.

1330
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,511
Try to blend in.

1331
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,831
Oh,Jesus!
Come on.

1332
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,392
There's gotta be a phone
around here somewhere.

1333
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,710
Over there. Look.

1334
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,836
I'm gonna try that number, okay?

1335
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,831
Let's hope it's nothing.

1336
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,750
It's okay! We're insane.

1337
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,956
We're crazy.
It's a carpet cleaning company.

1338
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,395
- A carpet cleaning company?
- Yeah. No superiors.

1339
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,472
No scientists.
No men from the future.

1340
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:38,358
It's just a carpet cleaning company.
They have voice mail.

1341
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:41,352
You leave a message telling
where you want your carpet cleaned.

1342
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,749
- You left them a message?
- Yeah, I couldn't resist.

1343
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,956
Wait till they hear this nutty woman
telling them to watch out...

1344
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:49,157
for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

1345
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,835
I said, "The Freedom for Animals
Association on Second Avenue--"

1346
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,595
"Is the secret headquarters of
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

1347
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:59,148
They're the ones
who are gonna do it.

1348
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,993
I can't do anything more now.
I have to go.

1349
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,435
Have a merry Christmas.''

1350
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,711
You couldn't have heard me.

1351
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:17,471
They got your message.

1352
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,713
They played it for me.

1353
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:24,917
It was a bad recording, distorted.

1354
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:28,631
I didn't recognize your voice.

1355
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:49,119
This.

1356
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,918
And this.

1357
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:56,200
And this.

1358
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,191
Is everything okay?
You want anything?

1359
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,751
Shall I put this
on your account, ma'am?

1360
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,990
No. That'll be cash.

1361
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:13,231
Can you tell me what floor
the wigs are on?

1362
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:26,154
You turned the thing
into a fucking computer.

1363
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,708
- And Fale believed it.
- You know Fale.

1364
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:33,032
He's like, "If you guys get nailed,
which I'm pretty sure you will...

1365
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,953
I've never seen you before
in my fuckin' life.''

1366
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,070
Come on, come on.

1367
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,878
Bring him through.

1368
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:47,955
Drive!

1369
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:55,832
What's the harm in openin' up the bag?
His eyes are taped, right?

1370
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,799
Right?

1371
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,511
Hello. Hello.

1372
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,991
Wanna hear the monkey speak?

1373
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,636
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, I know that's you.

1374
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,915
- I recognize your voice.
- No, you don't.

1375
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,231
I also know all about
your warped little plan.

1376
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,356
That lady, your psychiatrist?

1377
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,795
She told me.
I didn't believe her.

1378
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:29,031
It just seemed too crazy,
even for you.

1379
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,509
But just in case, I took steps...

1380
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,830
to make sure that
you couldn't go through with it.

1381
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,992
I don't have the code any more.

1382
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,196
I don't have access
to the virus.

1383
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:42,317
I took myself out of the loop.

1384
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:45,119
Too late! Too late!

1385
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,156
We've got plans for you, Dad.

1386
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,076
I never let myself believe it.
Now I know it's true.

1387
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:01,071
Jeffrey?

1388
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,594
You're completely insane.

1389
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:10,190
No, I'm not.

1390
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:17,319
<i>There's a cross section of one of</i>
<i>the old trees that's been cut down.</i>

1391
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,671
<i>Here I was born.</i>

1392
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,674
<i>And there I died.</i>

1393
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,149
<i>It was only a moment for you.</i>

1394
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,151
<i>You took no notice.</i>

1395
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:43,354
I think I've seen this movie before.

1396
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,069
- When I was a kid, I saw it on TV.
- Don't talk.

1397
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:50,038
- I did see it before.
- <i>Tall trees.</i>

1398
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,838
<i>Have you been here before?</i>

1399
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,512
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- When?</i>

1400
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:58,237
- But I don't recognize this--
- <i>When were you born?</i>

1401
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,038
- <i>Long ago.</i>
- <i>Where?</i>

1402
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,917
What's the matter?

1403
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,150
<i>Tell me.</i>
<i>Madeleine, tell me.</i>

1404
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:07,232
It's just like
what's happening with us.

1405
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,038
Like the past.

1406
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,789
The movie never changes.
It can't change.

1407
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:17,271
But every time you see it, it seems
different because you're different.

1408
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,828
You see different things.

1409
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,512
<i>Please don't ask me.</i>

1410
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,433
If you can't change anything
because it's already happened...

1411
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:26,431
you may as well
smell the flowers.

1412
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,112
What flowers?

1413
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,557
It's an expression.

1414
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,639
Why are you doing this?

1415
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:50,153
I want to know why.

1416
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,993
What if I'm wrong?
What if you're wrong?

1417
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:55,071
What if I am crazy?

1418
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:58,755
In a few weeks,
it will have started or it won't.

1419
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,398
If there's still...

1420
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,748
football games, traffic jams...

1421
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,831
TV shows
and armed robberies...

1422
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:08,717
we're going to be so glad...

1423
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,791
that we'll be thrilled
to see the police.

1424
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,677
<i>I'm responsible for you now.</i>

1425
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:15,718
<i>The Chinese say</i>
<i>once you've saved a person's life...</i>

1426
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,711
<i>you're responsible for it forever,</i>
<i>so I'm committed.</i>

1427
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,279
Do you have a plan?

1428
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,316
<i>I have to know.</i>

1429
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,311
<i>There's so little that I know.</i>

1430
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:28,040
You said
you'd never seen the ocean.

1431
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,670
Hurry up. Come on.

1432
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,238
Jeffrey?

1433
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:46,235
You know I can't see.
Where are we?

1434
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,232
Jeffrey? Please.

1435
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,511
We have 9:30 reservations
for Key West.

1436
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:33,237
I just didn't recognize you.

1437
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,630
Well, you look
pretty different yourself.

1438
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,191
It was always you.

1439
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,271
In my dream.

1440
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,871
It was always you.

1441
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,271
I remember you like this.

1442
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,078
You do?

1443
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,469
I felt I've known you before.

1444
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,836
I feel like I've always known you.

1445
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:19,071
I'm so scared.

1446
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,271
What time's your flight, friends?

1447
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,635
- 9:30.
- Might be tight.

1448
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:59,190
Tight? No.
My watch says 7:30.

1449
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:02,590
On your normal mornin', okay.
Plenty of time.

1450
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:06,514
But today you gotta take into account
your Army of the Twelve Monkeys factor.

1451
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:09,068
What? What'd you say?

1452
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,752
Twelve Monkeys.

1453
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,718
In case you folks didn't turn on
your radio this mornin'.

1454
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,110
Bunch of weirdos let
all the animals out of the zoo.

1455
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:19,998
Then they locked up this
big-shot scientist in one of the cages.

1456
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,469
Scientist's own kid
one of the ones did it.

1457
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,075
They've got animals
all over the place.

1458
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,833
Bunch of zebras closed down
the thruway about an hour ago.

1459
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:31,115
And they got some thing
called an emu.

1460
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:35,193
It's got traffic blocked
for miles on 676.

1461
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,589
<i>What do they think they're accomplishing</i>
<i>by releasing an animal like this...</i>

1462
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,513
<i>into a city like this one?</i>

1463
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:42,875
That's what they were up to--
freeing animals.

1464
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,272
On the walls. It said, "We did it."
They meant the animals.

1465
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:58,599
I think it's gonna be all right.

1466
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:05,395
Tell your people if they spot either one
of them not to try and apprehend them.

1467
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,994
They should notify us.
We have people all over the airport.

1468
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,036
We'll take care of it.

1469
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,440
- I know this place.
- Airports all look the same.

1470
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,352
This is my dream.

1471
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,349
- Your moustache.
- It's not just my dream.

1472
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:51,480
I was actually here.
I remember now.

1473
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:57,158
About a week or two
before everyone started dying.

1474
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,037
Careful.
They might be looking for us.

1475
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:05,396
- I was here as a kid.
- Use this.

1476
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:08,916
I think you were here then too.

1477
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,470
If they identify us,
they're going to send us someplace...

1478
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,471
but it won't be Key West.

1479
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:20,398
I'll go fix this.

1480
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:23,756
I'm gonna get the tickets.
I'll meet you in the newspaper stand.

1481
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:38,232
Judy Simmons.
I have reservations for Key West.

1482
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,196
- I don't see a lot of this. It's cash.
- It's a long story.

1483
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:54,475
We'll begin boarding
in about 20 minutes.

1484
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,755
- You have a nice flight, Miss Simmons.
- Thank you.

1485
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,396
Hello. How are you today?

1486
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,950
I don't know whether
you're there or not.

1487
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,031
Maybe you just clean carpets.

1488
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:13,078
If you do, you're lucky.
You're gonna live a long, happy life.

1489
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:15,515
But if you other guys are out there,
if you're picking this up...

1490
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:17,636
forget about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

1491
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:20,632
They didn't do it. It was a mistake.
Someone else did it.

1492
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,915
The Army of the Twelve Monkeys
is just a bunch of dumb kids...

1493
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,991
playing revolutionaries.

1494
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:32,192
Listen, I've done my job.
I did what you wanted.

1495
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:34,669
Good luck.
I'm not coming back.

1496
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,071
San Francisco, New Orleans...

1497
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:40,958
Rio de Janeiro, Rome...

1498
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:44,237
Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok and Peking.

1499
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,357
This is some trip you're taking, sir.
Is this all in one week?

1500
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,510
Business.

1501
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,875
Have a good one, sir.

1502
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:08,999
Got yourself a prob, Bob?

1503
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,473
Leave me alone!

1504
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,710
I made a report.
I didn't have to do that.

1505
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,392
Point of fact:

1506
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,755
You don't belong here.

1507
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,798
It's not permitted to let you stay.

1508
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:23,996
This is the present.

1509
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:27,197
This is not the past.
This is not the future.

1510
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,713
This is right now!

1511
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,360
I'm not leaving! Get that?

1512
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,159
You can't stop me.

1513
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:36,674
Anything you say, chief.
It's none of my business.

1514
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,070
- Hey, Cole.
- Leave me alone!

1515
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:51,071
Calm down, Cole. It's me.

1516
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:53,071
Cole, it's me.

1517
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:58,753
-Jose?
- Yeah, right,Jose.

1518
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:02,230
Why'd you pull out the tooth?
That was nuts.

1519
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,232
- Here, take this.
- What for? Are you crazy?

1520
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,753
Me? Are you kidding?

1521
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:10,389
You're the one.
You're a hero, man.

1522
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,278
They pardoned you, and you
come back and fuck with your teeth.

1523
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,397
- How did you find me?
- The phone call, man.

1524
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,914
They did their
reconstruction thing on it.

1525
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,913
The phone--
The phone call I just made?

1526
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,275
- Five minutes ago.
- Yeah, five minutes ago.

1527
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,079
Thirty years ago.
They just put it together.

1528
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,071
"Uh, hey, this is Cole,James.

1529
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,549
I don't know whether you're there
or not. Maybe you just clean carpets.''

1530
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,437
Where'd you get that from?

1531
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:37,910
"Forget about the Army
of the Twelve Monkeys."

1532
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,719
Man, if only they could've
got your message earlier.

1533
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,075
Take it. You could still be
a hero if you cooperate!

1534
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,551
Come on,James.
It's okay.

1535
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,439
- $6.50's your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1536
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:16,112
<i>Flight 784 for San Francisco</i>
<i>is ready for boarding at gate 38.</i>

1537
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,510
Oh, my God!

1538
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:26,434
I got orders to shoot the lady
if you don't go along this time.

1539
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:28,158
- What?
- Yeah, you got that?

1540
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:30,754
- They said, "If Cole don't obey--"
- I'll break your fuckin' head!

1541
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,558
You hear me?

1542
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:36,917
<i>Volunteers now boarding</i>
<i>at gate 37.</i>

1543
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,710
You see?
I had no choice.

1544
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,951
These are my orders, man.
Just take it.

1545
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:45,234
Take it!

1546
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:52,192
This part isn't about
the virus at all, is it?

1547
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:56,068
It's about following orders,
about doing what you're told.

1548
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:59,152
Hey, man, you got a pardon.
What do you want?

1549
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:02,277
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Who am I supposed to shoot?

1550
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,635
James! It's Dr Goines' assistant.

1551
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:07,871
He's an apocalypse nut.
I think he's involved.

1552
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:10,474
The next flight to San Francisco
leaves from gate 38.

1553
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,676
If he's there,
I'm sure he's part of it.

1554
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,870
Mr Holtz, you wanna have
a look at this, please?

1555
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:31,038
Sir, would you mind letting me have
a look at the contents of your bag?

1556
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:33,111
We don't have time for this.

1557
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,589
Excuse me.

1558
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:42,320
Biological samples.

1559
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,391
I have the papers right here.

1560
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:48,870
I'm gonna have to ask you
to open this up, sir.

1561
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,996
Open it?

1562
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:53,230
Why, yes, of course.

1563
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:57,710
What could be better?
Look at the planes. Hurry up.

1564
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:00,917
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am, you have to get in the line.

1565
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,672
You see?

1566
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:05,433
Biological.
Check the papers.

1567
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,353
It's all proper.
I have a permit.

1568
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:16,551
- It's empty.
- Well, yes, to be sure.

1569
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:21,395
It looks empty,
but I assure you, it's not.

1570
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:23,391
- You don't understand.
- I don't have to.

1571
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:27,439
This is very important.
There's a man carrying a deadly virus.

1572
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:32,230
There, you see?
Also invisible to the naked eye.

1573
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:38,718
It doesn't even have an odour.

1574
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,031
That's not necessary, sir.
There you go.

1575
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:45,237
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a good flight.

1576
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:56,277
- Who are you calling a moron?
- I am calling you a fucking moron!

1577
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:58,715
- A fucking moron?
- Get your hands off her!

1578
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:03,711
Hold it!
Wait a moment.

1579
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:21,720
There he is! That man!
He's carrying a deadly virus!

1580
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:24,553
Stop him!
Somebody, please stop him!

1581
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,748
Police officer.

1582
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,791
He's got a gun!

1583
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:44,352
Watch it!

1584
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,397
Freeze!

1585
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:09,912
Excuse me.

1586
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,831
It's obscene.

1587
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,229
All the violence,
all the lunacy.

1588
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:17,997
Shootings even at airports now.

1589
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:21,675
You might say that we're
the next endangered species.

1590
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,671
Human beings.

1591
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:28,589
I think you're right, ma'am.

1592
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:32,673
I think you've hit the nail
on the head.

1593
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,751
Jones is my name.

1594
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:44,068
I'm in insurance.
